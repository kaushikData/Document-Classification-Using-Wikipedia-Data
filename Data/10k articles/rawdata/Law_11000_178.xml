{{Administrative law}}

{{Main|Administrative law|Mongolia}}
'''Administrative law in [[Mongolia]]''' is the body of law that governs
the activities of [[Government agency|administrative agencies]] of the [[Mongolian government]]. These activities  include [[rulemaking]], [[adjudication]], or the
[[Rulemaking#Rulemaking and the courts|enforcement of a specific regulatory agenda]].

==History of administrative law==

Administrative law in [[Mongolia]] developed as the country transited from the [[Mongolian People's Republic|Soviet-era]] to a [[Mongolia|democratic state]]. The development can be divided into two main stages.

===Soviet-era===
'''During the Soviet-era:'''
*Three central agencies of state administration were formed.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Mongolian People’s Government became the highest agency of state power, with the powers to implement reforms in law, ministries and judiciary. (Primacy of the [[One-party state|one-party State]] upheld.)&lt;ref name=Butler/&gt;

===Post Soviet-era===
'''After democratisation:'''
*Major reforms of administrative structures and practices of government agencies as part of the transition into a [[market economy]]&lt;ref name=Nixson&gt;

*[[Executive (government)|Executive power]] circumscribed by the [[Constitution of Mongolia|Constitution]], which in turn is enforced by a newly established [[Constitutional Court of Mongolia|Constitutional ''Tsets''(Court)]].&lt;ref name=Sanders/&gt;

*United Nations adapted the [[New Zealand]] model of administrative reforms for Mongolia which served to further eliminate conflict of interests in the restructuring of administrative units.&lt;ref name=Nixson/&gt;

==Sources of law in Mongolia==

===Constitution===
The [[Constitution of Mongolia|Constitution]] is the supreme source of law in [[Mongolia]]. Influenced by the [[Civil Law (Legal System)|Romano-Germanic civil law system]], [[Mongolia]] recognizes [[Codification (law)|written law]] as the main source of law. The [[Constitution of Mongolia|Constitution in 1992]] abolished [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxism-Leninist ideology]] and laid out the [[democracy|democratic]] principles of the [[separation of powers|separation of state powers]] and the [[fundamental rights|fundamental rights of citizens]].&lt;ref name=WIPOCon&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=3039 "Constitution of Mongolia, at WIPO]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Article 10.jpg|thumb|left|Article 10 of 1992 Constitution of Mongolia]]

===Statutes===
[[Statutes]] are a primary source of law. There is an accepted distinction between normative acts (which regulates conventional social behavior) and non-normative acts.&lt;ref name=Butler2&gt;
{{Citation
 | last1 = Butler
 | first1 = William
 | title = The Mongolian Legal System (Studies on Socialist Legal Systems)

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The hierarchy of state agencies is a factor that determines which agency will govern which act. Only the [[State Great Khural|legislative branch of the government]] has the right to make laws.&lt;ref name=Butler2/&gt;

===Legal Customs===
Mongolia’s nomadic past and unique living habits has elevated the importance of [[Custom (law)|customs]] as a source of law. Throughout generations, customs that complement existing legal norms have prevailed. However, as there is lack of substantial evidence in literature, it is uncertain if Mongolian courts will recognize customs in the absence of legislation.&lt;ref name=Butler2/&gt;

===International Law===
The position of [[international law]] as a source of law in [[Mongolia]] was elevated following the [[Constitution of Mongolia|1992 Constitution of Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexadin.nl/wlg/legis/nofr/oeur/lxwemon.htm Legislation, Mongolia] Lexadin, The World Law Guide&lt;/ref&gt; According to Art 10(3) of the Constitution, international treaties to which Mongolia is a party eventually becomes domestic law, unless they contradict the Constitution itself.&lt;ref name=WIPOCon/&gt;

==Areas of administrative rulemaking==

{{Clickable map of Mongolian provinces|left|}}
[[Mongolia]] is divided administratively into 21 ''[[Aimag (country subdivision)#Mongolia|aimags]]'' (provinces) according to Article 57 of the [[Constitution of Mongolia|Constitution]].&lt;ref name=ConMong&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/mg00000_.html ''The Constitution of Mongolia'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution vests the governor and parliament of the [[Provinces of Mongolia|provinces]] with self-administrative powers.&lt;ref name=ConMong/&gt;

The [[Politics of Mongolia#Executive branch|Government of Mongolia]] is vested with the executive power of [[Mongolia]]&lt;ref name=ConMong/&gt;
and is composed of Ministries&lt;ref name=ConMong/&gt;
under the direction of the Cabinet and the [[Prime Minister of Mongolia|Prime Minister]]. The roles, duties and responsibilities of these government agencies are usually defined by codified statutes.

The following lists the ministries within the [[Politics of Mongolia#Executive branch|Government]] with significant existing bodies of regulations:

[[File:Nalaikh 11.JPG|thumb|left| A miner in Mongolia.]]

===Ministry of Mineral Resources===

With respect to mining activity in Mongolia,&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mg.html "CIA World Factbook"]&lt;/ref&gt; the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy, their subsidiary government and the local ''aimag'' government have responsibilities regulated by the Mineral Laws of Mongolia.&lt;ref name=MinLaws&gt;[http://www.investmongolia.com/fifta/law/law40.pdf "The Mineral Laws of Mongolia, Articles 9, 10, 11 and 12"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324085956/http://www.investmongolia.com/fifta/law/law40.pdf |date=March 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the local administrative body of an ''aimag'' has a duty to monitor compliance with respect to environmental reclamation, health and safety regulations under Article 12 of the Mineral Laws.&lt;ref name=MinLaws/&gt;

===Ministry of Environment===

The duties and powers of the Ministry of Environment in Mongolia are largely governed by the Environmental Protection Law of Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investmongolia.com/fifta/law/law12.pdf  "Environmental Protection Law of Mongolia"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324090038/http://www.investmongolia.com/fifta/law/law12.pdf |date=March 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, other laws such as the Law of Mongolia on Land also empower the land departments of individual ''aimags'' in the enforcement of the land laws of Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investmongolia.com/fifta/law/law28.pdf  "Law of Mongolia on Land"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324090048/http://www.investmongolia.com/fifta/law/law28.pdf |date=March 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Customs Office===

The General Customs Office of Mongolia and their State Customs Inspectors have to abide by the Customs Law of Mongolia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investmongolia.com/fifta/law/law10.pdf " Customs Law of Mongolia"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324090058/http://www.investmongolia.com/fifta/law/law10.pdf |date=March 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when they enforce customs laws. In addition, they are also empowered to impose tariffs on goods under the Customs Tariff Law of Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investmongolia.com/fifta/law/law09.pdf " Customs Tariff Law of Mongolia"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324090109/http://www.investmongolia.com/fifta/law/law09.pdf |date=March 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear Energy Agency===

The Nuclear Energy Agency is also bound by the Law of Mongolia on its nuclear-weapon-free status, to only use nuclear energy for non-military purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opanal.org/NWFZ/Mongolia/Mlaw_en.html "Law of Mongolia on its nuclear-weapon-free status"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331162033/http://www.opanal.org/NWFZ/Mongolia/Mlaw_en.html |date=March 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministry of Education===

The [[Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science (Mongolia)|Ministry of Education]] has recently reformed its laws. In 2000, due to budget deficiencies, Mongolian schools were reported to have resorted to child labour to generate income.&lt;ref&gt;'' Decentralization and Recentralization Reform in Mongolia: Tracing the Swing of the Pendulum ''&lt;/ref&gt; These problems were finally addressed by the 2002 Education Law, in which the  government finally recentralised educational finance in the form of the 'single treasury' measure.

===Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs===

Police laws were adopted in 1994 and were implemented to UN standards. The Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles for the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials are the body of regulations governing all law enforcement officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncjin.org/Standards/Conduct/ccl/mongolia.pdf " Application of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113093745/http://www.uncjin.org/Standards/Conduct/ccl/mongolia.pdf |date=January 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Human Rights Commission===

The National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia Act was enacted to empower and regulate the administrative functions of the National Human Rights Commission. Thereafter, the Commission was established by a [[State Great Khural]] resolution on 11 January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mn-nhrc.org/en/about "About the National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia Act"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902212633/http://www.mn-nhrc.org/en/about |date=September 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act empowers the Commission with the power to investigate complaints with regards to violations of human rights,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/database/nhri-law-mongolia.html "National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia Act"]&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others.

==Process of regulatory rulemaking and discretion of regulators==
{{Main|Rulemaking}}

[[File:President Putin meeting deputies of the Great State Hural-1.jpg|thumb|left| [[State Great Khural]]]]

===Legislature's role===

The 1992 [[Constitution of Mongolia]] introduced a parliamentary system. Laws are made by a unicameral legislature known as the [[State Great Khural]] comprising 76 members representing 26 multi-member constituencies who are elected by bloc vote for a term of 4 years.

External input is sought by the legislature to ensure greater inclusiveness in
decision-making. [[ngo|Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)]] and [[Community organization|Community-Based Organizations (CBOs)]] can participate in the law-making process by joining a group to aid in the drafting of a specific law, or by special invitation (fairly rare). In 2007, a CBO coalition proposed amendments to the law-making process which have been tabled in Parliament. The ‘citizens’ hall’ process was initiated in 2009 to facilitate the public’s input into the law-making process.

These efforts also extend to ensuring transparency in executive action. In 2009, a parliamentary working group on the mineral sector was set up in an effort to ensure that Mongolia does not repeat the mistakes of other resource-rich countries in its mining program and that expansion of the mining sector adheres to principles of transparency.&lt;ref&gt;"Mongolia Mission Report – Parliamentary Network on World Bank"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sükhbaataryn Batbold (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200x200px|[[Prime Minister of Mongolia]]]]

===Executive's role===

The Executive comprises the [[Prime Minister of Mongolia|Prime Minister]] and his Cabinet, appointed by the [[President of Mongolia|President]], a ceremonial head of state. The Executive enforces the laws made by the [[State Great Khural|Legislature]] and can create subsidiary legislation to that end.

The Executive too has taken steps to ensure transparency. Mongolia’s National Legal Institute (NLI), which is affiliated with the Ministry of Home Affairs and Justice, makes all approved legislation available online. The NLI also inputs into the legislative process by researching existing and proposed laws and by introducing new laws to the general public. The NLI also cooperates with the [[State Great Khural|Mongolian parliament]] by exchanging information directly with the parliamentary research center. This ensures that citizens are aware of the laws they are subjected to and reflects transparency of rule-making to the Mongolian public.

Executive action in Mongolia is also bound by international conventions to which it is a signatory. This is stipulated in Article 10(3) of the [[Constitution of Mongolia|Mongolian Constitution]]. 160 out of the 373 laws in force in [[Mongolia]] included provisions stating that should they conflict with international treaties, the treaties will take precedence.&lt;ref&gt;"Mongolia Laws-Child Rights Information Network"&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive power can also be subjected to [[judicial review]], as will be discussed below.

==Process for private challenges to government actions and rules==
{{Main|Judicial Review}}
[[File:9 steps.jpg|thumb|right|Process of judicial review.]]

===Judicial review of administrative action===
Individuals may challenge [[Executive (government)|executive]] acts through a process known as [[judicial review]].

====Case Study====
In one example of an action involving judicial review of administrative action in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;"Decision of the Administrative Court,Arkhangai Province,No.4 (May 2, 2005) (Jargalsaikhan J)"&lt;/ref&gt; an application for a mining license by a mining company was discussed at a local ''hural'' (legislature) of a [[Sum (country subdivision)#Mongolia|''soum'']] (district)&lt;ref&gt;"A governmental sub-division of Mongolia with administrative powers"&lt;/ref&gt; and most of those present were opposed to the application. However, the Praesidium (executive head of the ''soum'') approved of the application and the mining company then obtained a license from the central government. Despite protests from leaders of the ''hural'', the Praesidium issued a decision that the company had the right to proceed under its license. The leaders of the ''hural'' subsequently appealed to the Arkhangai Province Administrative Court. The court held that:
*the Praesidium had no authority to overrule the hural;
*the mining company's license was invalid;
*if the river were damaged by mining activities, the families in the valley would not be able to sustain their herds and would have to move to the city; and
*it called for more transparency in licensing procedures by the ''soum'' executive.

====Process of judicial review====

Step 1: A complainant must submit his complaint against a government action within 30 days under the statute of limitation.&lt;ref name=JudProc&gt;

}}
(one-click download available for pdf; File name: SSRN-id1695283. ;   Size: 128K)&lt;/ref&gt;

Step 2: A pre-hearing is conducted by the Administrative Tribunal before the complaint is allowed to proceed to the administrative courts. At the hearing, a direct supervising officer decides on the legality of the government action.&lt;ref name=JudProc/&gt;

Step 3: Parties not in favour of the outcome of the pre-hearing are allowed to file an appeal to the administrative courts.&lt;ref name=JudProc/&gt;
Step 4: The administrative courts are to allow commencement of the action within 7 days upon receiving the claim.&lt;ref name=JudProc/&gt;

Step 5: A court official delivers the summons to the defendant.&lt;ref name=JudProc/&gt;

Step 6: In court, the judge or his law clerk would submit the copy of claim, attached materials, and inform the defendant of his rights.&lt;ref name=JudProc/&gt;

Step 7: When a claim is accepted by the court, the judge invites the defendant to a meeting to determine whether there is a valid defense. If a settlement is not reached, a date is allocated for the hearing and it must be held within 75 days (for the Capital City Administrative Court) or 85 days (for provincial administrative courts) after filing.&lt;ref name=JudProc/&gt;

Step 8: A public trial is held. All evidence is presented and examined at the hearing and the court secretary makes a full transcript.&lt;ref name=JudProc/&gt;
Step 9: Decisions are made in the “conference room” after hearing the opinion/comment of the citizen representatives. If there is more than one judge on the bench, the decision is made by majority vote.&lt;ref name=JudProc/&gt;

==Analysis and assessment of current rules==

[[File:Jacku.jpg|thumb|left|Court Structure of Mongolia]]
[[File:Papapa.jpg|thumb|left|Divisions of the Supreme Court]]

===Current standard of administrative laws===
Administrative laws in [[Mongolia]] have acceptable standards of transparency and clarity, with 160 of the 373 laws in [[Mongolia]] being international laws incorporated through the signing of treaties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crin.org/resources/infoDetail.asp?ID=25088&amp;flag=report "Child Rights Information Network"]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most of [[Mongolia|Mongolia’s]] police law (especially the regulations governing the use of force and firearms) adheres to specific UN standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncjin.org/Standards/Conduct/ccl/mongolia.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113093745/http://www.uncjin.org/Standards/Conduct/ccl/mongolia.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For local laws, the Executive has also taken steps to ensure transparency in the rule-making process. However, the transplantation of international standards into the local social climate is insufficient in eradicating unlawful executive behaviour. For example, the detection and prosecution of corrupt police officers remains unsatisfactory due to the lack of an open procedural reporting system within the police force. In addition, the detention and prison system in [[Mongolia]] faces a huge lack of financial resources, giving rise to low inmate living conditions that are incompatible with the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41867.pdf"Susan V. Lawrence, "Mongolia: Issues for Congress" (14 June 2011)"]&lt;/ref&gt; It can thus be seen that though the letter of administrative law is fundamentally sound, its enforcement needs to be strengthened.

===State of judicial review===
The establishment of [[Administrative courts in Mongolia|administrative courts]] signified a marked progress in the judicial system of Mongolia as well as the increasing emphasis that the country is placing on protecting [[individual rights]] against unlawful governmental action. Nevertheless, the nascent development of administrative law in [[Mongolia]] has naturally invited a fair share of controversy and criticism over the role of the [[Administrative courts in Mongolia|administrative courts]] in [[judicial review]].

====Executive non-compliance with judicial decisions====
In a study conducted by Brent T. White&lt;ref&gt;Associate Professor of Law, University of Arizona, James E. Rogers College of Law&lt;/ref&gt; in his article,&lt;ref&gt;"Rotten to the Core: Project Capture and the Failure of Judicial Reform in Mongolia" [2009] 4 East Asia Law Review 209&lt;/ref&gt; 50% of experts surveyed disagreed with the statement, “Court decisions are respected and enforced by other branches of government.” These experts also indicated that the executive branch often does not honour court decisions with which it disagrees. One expert even indicated that tax inspectors feel free to ignore decisions by the courts when they believe the courts’ interpretation to be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Tsogt Natsagdorj, Partner, Bona Lex Law Firm, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia (May 7, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Executive interference with the judiciary====
In the same study, only 19% of the experts surveyed agreed that “Court decisions are free from political influence from other branches of government or public officials.” These experts shared the views that high-ranking government officials, including the [[President of Mongolia|President]], exert considerable influence over the courts, especially where the personal, political or business interests of the governments are at stake.

====Conflicts with the Constitutional ''Tsets''(Court)====
A recent conflict between the [[Administrative courts in Mongolia|administrative courts]] and the [[Constitutional Court of Mongolia|Constitutional ''Tsets'']] arose in 2004-2005 when the Capital City Administrative Court ruled in favour of the plaintiffs in two landmark cases.&lt;ref&gt;''Erdenebat &amp; Erdenebaatar v. Government of Mongolia'' (Capital City Admin. Ct 2005); ''Enkhbold v. General Election Committee'' (Capital City Admin. Ct 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; An action was then filed in the [[Constitutional Court of Mongolia|Constitutional ''Tsets'']] asserting the [[Constitutionality|unconstitutionality]] of Article 4.1.1 of the Law on Administrative Procedure, which lists the government offices and ministries which may be named as defendants in an [[Judicial review#Judicial review of administrative acts|administrative action]]. In ''Enkhbayar v Parliament'',&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional ''Tsets'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Tsets'' found Article 4.1.1 to be unconstitutional and accordingly directed [[State Great Khural|Parliament]] to amend the Law on Administrative Procedure. Such an incident exemplifies the tension in the duty of the [[Administrative courts in Mongolia|administrative courts]] in controlling the acts of the Executive and the [[Constitutional Court of Mongolia|Constitutional ''Tsets'']] in protecting the [[Constitution of Mongolia|Constitution]] as the supreme law of the land.

In a written article,&lt;ref name=JudProc/&gt; Tsogt Tsend, presently a Chief Judge in the Administrative Court of Appeals has nonetheless expressed two reasons for underscoring his support of the setting up of separate [[Administrative courts in Mongolia|administrative courts]] despite the concern of jurisdictional overlapping with the [[Constitutional Court of Mongolia|Constitutional ''Tsets'']]. The first is the specialized nature of the [[Administrative courts in Mongolia|administrative courts]] which serves as a focal point for the development of Mongolian administrative law. The second is aggrieved claimants being given provision of access to judges highly trained in the field of administrative law. This will hopefully increase public confidence in the [[Administrative courts in Mongolia|administrative courts]] and encourage [[Lawyer|attorneys]] to take the fight against illegal administrative action to a new level.

===Comparison with other countries===
Like most [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law systems]], such as [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Law of Germany|Germany]], [[Mongolia]] has specialized [[Administrative courts in Mongolia|administrative courts]]&lt;ref name=ConMong/&gt; with exclusive power to hear [[judicial review]]s. In contrast, in [[common law|common-law]] countries like [[England]] and [[administrative law in Singapore|Singapore]], [[judicial review]] actions are heard in a [[court]] of [[general jurisdiction]] like the [[High Court]].&lt;ref name=Nelken&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the powers of the [[Administrative courts in Mongolia|administrative courts]] are derived from a codified statute called the Law on Administrative Procedure. This ensures certainty, reliability and legitimacy. In [[common law]] courts, (e.g. in [[England]]) [[judicial review]] is developed through [[case law]] and is not a power granted by [[statute]], a result of which people have [[Judicial interference|questioned the legitimacy of this process]].&lt;ref name=Nelken/&gt;

'''''Barclays Bank Ltd v W J Simms, Son and Cooke (Southern) Ltd''''' [1980] 1 QB 677, [1979] 3 All ER 522 was a decision of the [[High Court of Justice]] relating to the recovery of a payment mistakenly made by a bank after the customer had countermanded the [[cheque]].&lt;ref  name=Swarb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarb.co.uk/barclays-bank-v-wj-simms-cooke-southern-ltd-qbd-1979/|title=Barclays Bank -v- WJ Simms &amp; Cooke (Southern) Ltd; QBD 1979|publisher=swarb.co.uk|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision is important not only for the specific point in issue, but it also was one of the earlier cases in relation to the modern development of the [[Restitution in English law|English law of restitution]] in relation to payments made under [[English unjust enrichment law#Mistake|mistake of fact]] and the defence of [[change of position]].  One commentator has gone so far as to say: "the decision of Robert Goff J in ''Barclays Bank v Simms'' should be considered to be the ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' of restitution for mistake."&lt;ref name=Virgo /&gt;

==Facts==
The Royal British Legion Housing Association Ltd (called the "Association" in the judgment) was a customer of [[Barclays Bank]].  The Association had entered into a standard form building contract with W J Simms (called the "Company" in the judgment) for building works in the amount of just over ₤699,000.  Separately the Company had obtained a bank loan from [[National Westminster Bank]] pursuant to which the Company had granted National Westminster Bank an all-assets [[floating charge]].

On 12 September 1977 the Association issued a cheque for ₤24,000 to the Company upon completion of certain works as specified in the contract.  However, on the next day - 13 September 1977 - National Westminster Bank appointed a [[Receivership|receiver]] over the Company's assets and undertaking.  Under clause 25 of the building contract the appointment of a receiver terminated the contract (albeit with an option to renew).

On the 15 September 1977 at 9.20am, after they had heard that the Company had gone into receivership, the Association contacted the bank and instructed the bank to put a stop on the cheque.  Those instructions were confirmed in writing, and entered by Barclays Bank in its computer system.  However, due to an error the payment was made.  Once the bank discovered the error, they contacted the receiver and demanded repayment of the sum, but the receiver (Mr Sowman) refused.  The bank accepted that it was not entitled to debit the account of the Association, and brought proceedings against the Company for the return of the monies which it had mistakenly paid out under the stopped cheque.

==Judgment==

===Mistake of fact===
In a long and difficult judgment, [[Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley|Robert Goff J]] analysed and tried to rationalise a swathe of existing case law in relation to payments made under mistake of fact, starting with ''[[Kelly v Solari]]'' (1841) 9 M&amp;W 54.  After summarising the relevant cases, and noting which ones appeared to be inconsistent with House of Lords authority, the judge summarised the position as follows:

{{Cquote|(1) If a person pays money to another under a mistake of fact which causes him to make the payment, he is prima facie entitled to recover it as money paid under a mistake of fact. (2) His claim may however fail if (a) the payer intends that the payee shall have the money at all events, whether the fact be true or false, or is deemed in law so to intend; or (b) the payment is made for good consideration, in particular if the money is paid to discharge and does discharge a debt owed to the payee (or a principal on whose behalf he is authorised to receive the payment) by the payer or by a third party by whom he is authorised to discharge the debt; or (c) the payee has changed his position in good faith or is deemed in law to have done so.&lt;ref&gt;[1980] QB 677 at 695C&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robert Goff J stated that these principles were derived from the speeches in the three [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] cases which he had reviewed.  Unusually, he also stated a number of propositions which had been previously enunciated in cases which he determined were ''not'' correct when taking against the authorities as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[1980] QB 677 at 696B-C&lt;/ref&gt;

He also noted that if the payment had been made by the bank under a [[contract]] then there could be no recovery unless the contract itself was [[void (law)|void]] for mistake.  However, in this case there was no contract between Barclays and W J Simms - only a putative mandate from their customer to pay money over.

===Mandate===
Robert Goff J noted that a bank which pays a cheque drawn or purportedly drawn by a customer without a mandate is paying without mandate, and cannot debit the customer's account.  In such cases, the bank has paid out its own money.  However, the bank is entitled to recover the mistaken payment unless the payee has changed his position in good faith.  But if the payment had been within the customer's mandate (i.e. the mistake of fact had been related to something else entirely) there could be no recovery, as the payment would discharge the customer's debt to the payee.

===Change of position===
The judge then reviewed the various cases suggesting that where a payee has changed their position in good faith in reliance upon the payment, they should not be required to repay sums where it would be inequitable to do so.  Noting a number of technical rules which had evolved in the judgments, Robert Goff J confined himself to saying "if, in due course, full recognition is given to the defence of change of position, there will be no further need for any such stringent rule and the law can be reformulated on a more rational and less technical basis."&lt;ref&gt;[1980] QB 677 at 703B.  As the judge predicted, the defence was in due course recognised by the House of Lords in {{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd]]|court=UKHL | year=1988 |num=12 |date={{date|1991-06-06}}}}, where Robert Goff was also sitting and gave the lead judgment.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision===
Applying the facts to the case, the court held that (1) the mistake of the bank in overlooking the instruction to stop the cheque caused the payment; that (2) as the bank was acting without mandate, no obligation of the Association to the payee was discharge, and it follows from this that the payee gave no consideration to the bank for payment; (3) there was no evidence of any change of position by the recipient.  Accordingly, the court ordered that the sums be repaid to the bank.

The judge stated "I must confess I am happy to be able to reach the conclusion that the money is recoverable by the plaintiff bank."&lt;ref&gt;[1980] QB 677 at 703F&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a bona fide dispute between the Association and the Company as to whether the termination of the building contract terminated the right to the interim payment.  Now that dispute could be litigated.  Had the payment remained with the bank it would have been swallowed up by the creditors of the insolvent company leaving Barclays Bank to claim for a mere dividend in the bankruptcy, unjust enriching the creditors of the insolvent Company.

==Commentary==
{{Clist mistakes}}
The decision was not subject to an appeal, but it has been consistently applied since it was handed down and has not been subject to judicial criticism or doubted.  It has been cited and applied frequently&lt;ref name=Swarb /&gt; including by the House of Lords in {{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd]]|court=UKHL |year=1988 |num=12 |date={{date|1991-06-06}}}} and the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] in {{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Dextra Bank &amp; Trust Company Limited v Bank of Jamaica]] |court=UKPC |year=2002 |num=50 |date={{date|2001-11-26}}}}.  One academic commentator has said "the decision of Robert Goff J in ''Barclays Bank v Simms'' should be considered to be the ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' of restitution for mistake."&lt;ref name=Virgo&gt;{{cite book|last1=Virgo |first1=Graham |author-link1=Graham Virgo |year=1999 |title=The Principles of the Law of Restitution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bpQC6F46urIC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=importance+of+barclays+bank+v+simms&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ImAJYzeyW5&amp;sig=Bfd03jnXKhpWT-4sDY7fzFwG_aA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjaxqGs0arMAhXTsh4KHWvXCREQ6AEIPjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=importance%20of%20barclays%20bank%20v%20simms&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|isbn=0-19-876377-8|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision was also subject to limited academic criticism, including a strongly worded article by Professor [[Roy Goode]] in the [[Law Quarterly Review]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Goode|Goode, R.M.]] "''The bank's right to recover money paid on a stopped cheque''" (1981) 97 LQR 254&lt;/ref&gt;  Goode argued that the case was wrongly decided for three reasons: first, although the bank lacked express authority to pay on the cheque, it had [[implied authority]]; secondly, that the payee had changed their position and so should have had a good defence in law; and thirdly (although slightly speculatively) the better solution would be to treat the payment as discharging the debt of the customer and for the bank to be able to reclaim the sums from the customer under the doctrine of [[subrogation]].  Goode's criticisms of the decision have not been broadly accepted, either by commentators on the law of restitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goff |first1=Robert |author-link1=Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley |last2=Jones |first2=Gareth |author-link2=Gareth Jones (lawyer) |year=2007 |title=[[Goff &amp; Jones|The Law of Restitution]] |edition=7th |publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] |at=4-032 |isbn=9780421926004 |quote=Professor Goode also argues that Barclays had the apparent authority of the drawer to make the payment so that the payment was effect to discharge the drawer's liability on the cheque.  We know of no case in which this argument has been advanced; and we doubt whether it can be right that the drawer held out the bank as having authority to make the payment so as to preclude him from asserting that the bank did not have authority to do so: see ''Freeman &amp; Lockyer v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd'' [1964] 2 QB 480.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or on banking law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=E.P. Ellinger |author2=E. Lomnicka |author3=C. Hare |year=2011|title=Ellinger's Modern Banking Law |edition=5th|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-019-923209-3|page=536|quote=This criticism appears to be misplaced.  Such an argument was firmly rejected by the Court of Appeal in ''[[Lloyds Bank plc v Independent Insurance Co Ltd]]'', on the grounds that, first, there was no holding out that the bank had authority to make the payment, and, secondly, there was no reliance by the payee on the bank having authority to pay.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Canada v GlaxoSmithKline Inc'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{lexum-scc|2012|52}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the first ruling of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] that deals with issues involving [[transfer pricing]] and how they are treated under the ''Income Tax Act'' of Canada ("ITA").

==Background==
[[File:Ranitidine-A-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|Molecular structure of [[ranitidine]]]]
In 1976, a predecessor of [[GlaxoSmithKline]] Inc. ("GSK") discovered the drug [[ranitidine]], which was approved for sale in Canada in 1981 and marketed as Zantac. Ranitidine's primary manufacture was conducted by related companies located in the United Kingdom and Singapore, and it was subsequently sold to Adechsa SA, another related company located in Switzerland, for further sale to other group companies and unrelated distributors at prices dictated by the parent company.&lt;ref&gt;Appellant's factum at SCC, par. 9{{endash}}11&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the following intercompany agreements were entered into by Glaxo Canada:

:* in 1972, a Consultancy Agreement with Glaxo Group Limited covering services and intangibles provided to Glaxo Canada in exchange for a 5% royalty&lt;ref&gt;Appellant's factum at SCC, par. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
:* in 1983, a Supply Agreement with Adechsa for the purchase of ranitidine&lt;ref&gt;Appellant's factum at SCC, par. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
:* an amendment to the 1972 agreement, to cover services and intangibles relating to Zantac&lt;ref&gt;Appellant's factum at SCC, par. 14&lt;/ref&gt;
:* in 1988, a Licence Agreement with Glaxo Group Limited that replaced the 1972 agreement, and which covered various services and intangibles, in exchange for a 6% royalty on the net sales of drugs&lt;ref&gt;Appellant's factum at SCC, par. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

During its taxation years from 1990 to 1993, Glaxo deducted and remitted [[withholding tax]] with respect to royalty payments it made to Glaxo Group Limited under the 1988 agreement, but not with respect to payments to Adechsa under the 1983 agreement, which were considered fully deductible as [[cost of goods sold]].&lt;ref&gt;Appellant's factum at SCC, par. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, [[generic drug]] manufacturers such as [[Apotex]] and [[Novopharm]] were able to acquire ranitidine on the open market at prices significantly less than Glaxo Canada was paying under its 1983 agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Appellant's factum at SCC, para 19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minister of National Revenue]] subsequently reassessed Glaxo Canada's 1990{{endash}}1993 taxation years under:

Glaxo Canada subsequently appealed the reassessments to the [[Tax Court of Canada]].

==The courts below==

===Tax Court of Canada===
On 30 May 2008, the TCC allowed the appeals, ordering the s. 69(2) and Part XIII assessments to be returned to the Minister for reassessment with respect to a minor pricing adjustment. Otherwise, the approach used in arriving at the assessments was considered to be correct. [[Gerald J. Rip|Rip ACJ]] (as he then was) identified the key issues in the case as:&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (TCC), par. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

#whether the Supply Agreement and the Licence Agreement should be considered together to determine a reasonable transfer price
#the meaning of the phrase "reasonable in the circumstances" in s. 69(2)
#the impact of the differences in Glaxo's [[good manufacturing practice]]s and [[Occupational safety and health|health, safety and environmental standard]]s on the comparability of the ranitidine purchased by the appellant with that purchased by the generic companies

He ruled that the [[Transfer pricing#Comparable uncontrolled price|comparable uncontrolled price]] method was the preferred approach to use to establish the arm's length transfer price, subject to adjustment for the issues in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (TCC), par. 71&lt;/ref&gt; He also ruled that the Part XIII assessments for withholding tax were essentially correct, but subject to a minor pricing adjustment with respect to the drug's granulation.&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (TCC), par. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal Court of Appeal===
The TCC ruling was set aside by the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] on 26 July 2010. In his ruling, [[Marc Nadon|Nadon JA]] stated the trial judge had erred in the following respects:

:* concluding that the Licence Agreement and Supply Agreement were to be considered independently of one another within the context of ''Singleton v. Canada''&lt;ref&gt;''Singleton v. Canada'', 2001 SCC 61, [2001] 2 SCR 1046  {{lexum-scc|2001|61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (FCA), par. 65&lt;/ref&gt;
:* misunderstanding the s. 69(2) test of what is "reasonable in the circumstances"&lt;ref name = "par69"&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (FCA), par. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Singleton'' test applied to a different part of the Act under different circumstances,&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (FCA), para 66{{endash}}68&lt;/ref&gt; and the consideration of what is reasonable must be governed by the standard noted in ''Gabco Ltd v Minister of National Revenue'',&lt;ref&gt;''Gabco Ltd v Minister of National Revenue'', 68 DTC 5210 (Ex Cr), as endorsed by the FCA in {{cite CanLII|litigants=Petro-Canada v. The Queen|link=|year=2004|source=fca|num=158|pinpoint=|parallelcite=58 DTC 6329, [2004] 3 CTC 156|date=2004-04-23|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Cattanach J stated:

{{quote|It is not a question of the Minister or this Court substituting its judgment for what is a reasonable amount to pay, but rather a case of the Minister or the Court coming to the conclusion that no reasonable business man would have contracted to pay such an amount having only the business considerations of the appellant in mind.&lt;ref name = "par69" /&gt;}}

[[File:price trans-comp ext-small.jpg|thumb|175px|Transfer Pricing with a Competitive External Market]]
Nadon JA subsequently listed the following "circumstances" of what could be considered as reasonable in the case at bar:&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (FCA), par. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

#Glaxo Group owned the Zantac trademark and would own it even if the appellant was an arm's length licensee.
#Zantac commanded a premium over generic ranitidine drugs.
#Glaxo Group owned the ranitidine patent and would have owned it even if the appellant had been in an arm's length relationship.
#Without the License Agreement, the appellant would not have been in a position to use the ranitidine patent and the Zantac trademark.

Consequently, in those circumstances, the only possibility open to the appellant would have been to enter the generic market where the cost of entry into that market would likely have been high, considering that both Apotex and Novopharm were already well placed and positioned. Without the License Agreement, the appellant would not have had access to the portfolio of other patented and trademarked products to which it had access under the License Agreement.

The appeal was allowed with costs, setting aside the Tax Court's decision, and the matter was returned to the trial judge for rehearing and reconsideration of the matter in the light of the FCA's reasons.

An appeal by the Crown on the reversal, and cross-appeal by GSK with respect to the case being returned to the TCC for rehearing, were subsequently made to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], which heard the case on 13 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = Julius Melnitzer|title = The Queen v.

==Arguments before the SCC==

===Appeal===

The Crown argued that applying a "reasonable in the circumstances" test, as the FCA did, does not fulfil the conditions of section 69(2), as a price that may be reasonable is not necessarily an arm's-length price.&lt;ref&gt;Appellant's factum at SCC, par. 30{{endash}}34&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Crown, only those circumstances that would be relevant to parties bargaining at arm‟s length for a particular good should be considered in the analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Appellant's factum at SCC, par. 35{{endash}}49&lt;/ref&gt; which it asserted was supported by the SCC's rulings in ''Singleton'' and ''Shell Canada Ltd. v. Canada''.&lt;ref&gt;''Shell Canada Ltd. v. Canada'', [1999] 3 SCR 622, 1999 CanLII 647 (SCC)  {{lexum-scc2|1999|3|622|647}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its view, other circumstances, such as Glaxo Canada‟s status as a distributor of Zantac, were irrelevant to the consideration of the price paid for ranitidine.&lt;ref&gt;Appellant's factum at SCC, par. 50{{endash}}92&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to questions from the Justices about the meaning of "reasonable circumstances" in s. 69(2), the Crown submitted that:

:* the phrase was intended to consider only the "economically relevant circumstances" pertaining to the specific transaction in question, in accordance with the ''[[OECD]] Transfer Pricing Guidelines''&lt;ref&gt;for current version, see {{Cite web|title = Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations|url = http://www.oecd.org/ctp/transferpricing/transferpricingguidelinesformultinationalenterprisesandtaxadministrations.htm|publisher = [[OECD]]|accessdate = 2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* s. 69(2) did not allow consideration of "the whole deal"

As to questions as to whether a hypothetical independent licensee entering into a similar arrangement with Glaxo could be reassessed in the same manner, the Crown responded that such a licensee could be reassessed as not "dealing at arm‟s length" if it was tied into a set price and had no ability to bargain.

In its submission, GSK concurred with the FCA ruling with respect to the inclusion of the License Agreement in determining reasonable circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Respondent's factum at SCC, par. 41{{endash}}44&lt;/ref&gt; S. 69(2) should therefore be presumed to situate the parties at arm's length, ultimately asking, "Would they do the deal?"&lt;ref&gt;Respondent's factum at SCC, par. 45{{endash}}60&lt;/ref&gt; As to questions posed on whether the price paid for ranitidine was a bundled price for tangible and intangible property{{emdash}}thus potentially triggering liability for withholding tax{{emdash}}GSK contended that the situation was analogous to luxury brands such as [[Rolex]] and [[Porsche]]. While there are undoubtedly components of intellectual property embedded in the price of the tangible good, it is not Canadian law or practice to segregate and separately tax the discrete elements.

As to the applicability of the [[OECD]] guidelines, GSK stated that there was no dispute between the parties that the issue in question is solely the price of the tangible good rather than its characterization.&lt;ref&gt;Respondent's factum at SCC, par. 90{{endash}}99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-appeal===

In its cross-appeal, GSK submitted that it had demolished the Minister's reassessment by demonstrating that the theory at the heart of the liability determined by the Minister was wrong, and therefore the reassessment must be set aside.&lt;ref&gt;Respondent's factum at SCC, par. 100{{endash}}125&lt;/ref&gt; To a question posed as to whether the onus was still on the taxpayer to prove that it did not overpay for ranitidine (as the lower courts had not yet addressed the issue), GSK responded that, once it had demolished the Crown's basis for reassessment, the onus shifted to the Crown to show that Glaxo had paid too much.

In reply, the Crown contended that GSK did not demolish the reassessment, and therefore it remained valid and open for reconsideration by the TCC.&lt;ref&gt;Appellant's factum at SCC, par. 100{{endash}}109&lt;/ref&gt; To the question of whether, if the case were to be sent back to the TCC, any other issue could be argued, the Crown stated that the argument would remain essentially the same, as the generic comparable prices comprised the only available information to support arm's-length prices for ranitidine.

==Decision by the SCC==
[[File:ON-CourSupreme 20090606-164356 panoramique.jpg|thumb|left|Panoramic view of [[Supreme Court of Canada]] audience chamber]]
In a unanimous decision by [[Marshall Rothstein|Rothstein J]], the appeal and cross-appeal were dismissed.

===Appeal===

While s. 69(2) does not state what is a "reasonable amount", the OECD guidelines do provide commentary and methodology pertaining to the issue of transfer pricing. However, the test of any set of transactions or prices ultimately must be determined according to s. 69(2).&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (SCC), par. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

:* The trial judge erred in relying on ''Singleton'' and ''Shell Canada'' for requiring a transaction-by-transaction approach, but s. 69(2) only requires that the price established in a non-arm’s length transfer pricing transaction is to be redetermined as if it were between parties dealing at arm’s length.  If the circumstances require, transactions other than the purchasing transactions must be taken into account to determine whether the actual price was or was not greater than the amount that would have been reasonable had the parties been dealing at arm’s length.&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (SCC), par. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The OECD Guidelines state that a proper application of the arm’s length principle requires that regard be had for the "economically relevant characteristics" of the arm’s length and non-arm’s length circumstances to ensure they are "sufficiently comparable".&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (SCC), par. 42&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Considering the Licence and Supply agreements together offers a realistic picture of the profits of Glaxo Canada.  It cannot be irrelevant that Glaxo Canada’s function was primarily as a secondary manufacturer and marketer.  It did not originate new products and the intellectual property rights associated with them.  Nor did it undertake the investment and risk involved with originating new products.  Nor did it have the other risks and investment costs which Glaxo Group undertook under the Licence Agreement.  The prices paid by Glaxo Canada to Adechsa were a payment for a bundle of at least some rights and benefits under the Licence Agreement and product under the Supply Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (SCC), par. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also noted that the issue as to whether the purchase price includes compensation for intellectual property rights granted to Glaxo Canada had not been specifically argued before the SCC, and could still trigger potential further liability for Part XIII withholding tax. It may still be raised during the subsequent rehearing at the TCC.&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (SCC), par. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The following further guidance was given with respect to the forthcoming redetermination by the trial judge:&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (SCC), par. 61{{endash}}64&lt;/ref&gt;

#In determining what constitutes a "reasonable amount" under s. 69(2), even the OECD guidelines concede that "transfer pricing is not an exact science". As long as a transfer price is within what the court determines is a reasonable range, the requirements of the section should be satisfied.
#While assessment of the evidence is a matter for the trial judge, the respective roles and functions of Glaxo Canada and the Glaxo Group should be kept in mind. Whether or not compensation for intellectual property rights is justified in this particular case, is a matter for determination by the Tax Court judge.
#Prices between parties dealing at arm's length will be established having regard to the independent interests of each party to the transaction, and an appropriate determination under the arm's length test of s. 69(2) should reflect these realities.
#In this case there is some evidence that indicates that arm's length distributors have found it in their interest to acquire ranitidine from a Glaxo Group supplier, rather than from generic sources.  This suggests that higher-than-generic transfer prices are justified and are not necessarily greater than a reasonable amount under s. 69(2).

===Cross-appeal===
The assessments were based on two assumptions:&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (SCC), par. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

:* the Appellant paid Adechsa, with whom it was not dealing at arm’s length, a price for ranitidine which was greater than the amount that would have been reasonable in the circumstances if the Appellant and Adechsa had been dealing at arm’s length
:* any amounts paid by the appellant to Adechsa over and above the prices paid by other Canadian pharmaceutical companies were not for the supply of ranitidine

Only the second could be characterized as having been demolished, but if Glaxo had been successful in establishing that the prices it paid were reasonable, the first would have been demolished as well. As [[Claire L'Heureux-Dubé|L'Heureux-Dubé]] J had stated in ''Hickman Motors Ltd v Canada'', the taxpayer's burden is to "'demolish' the exact assumptions made by the Minister but no more".&lt;ref&gt;''Hickman Motors Ltd v Canada'', [1997] 2 SCR 336 {{lexum-scc2|1997|2|336|357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (SCC), par. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

As Glaxo had previously conceded at the FCA that the court could determine what was the reasonable amount, it was within the FCA's discretion to remit the question to the TCC for that very determination. Accordingly, that aspect of the FCA's ruling was upheld.&lt;ref&gt;''GlaxoSmithKline'' (SCC), par. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
There has been little jurisprudence on [[transfer pricing]] in Canada, and, being the first time this area had been addressed by the SCC, the judgment was greatly anticipated, not just in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tax Alert - Canada: Supreme Court of Canada hears the ''GlaxoSmithKline'' case|url = http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Tax_Alert_2012_No_01/$FILE/TaxAlert2012No01.pdf|publisher = [[Ernst &amp; Young LLP]]|date = 2012-01-16|accessdate = 2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GlaxoSmithKline Transfer Pricing Decision - What's at Stake?|url = http://www.kpmg.com/ca/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/global-tax-adviser/pages/glaxosmithkline%20transfer%20pricing%20decision%20-%20what%27s%20at%20stake.aspx|publisher = [[KPMG LLP]]|date = 2012-09-11|accessdate = 2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Arm's Length Standard in the Real World: The Federal Court of Appeals Decision in GlaxoSmithKline Inc.|url = http://www.bakermckenzie.com/RRCanadaArmsLengthStandardNov10/|publisher = [[Baker &amp; McKenzie]]|date = November 2010|accessdate = 2012-10-17|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101225005025/http://www.bakermckenzie.com/RRCanadaArmsLengthStandardNov10/#|archive-date = 2010-12-25|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GlaxoSmithKline Inc v The Queen|url = http://moorestephensresources.com.au/articles/386/1/GlaxoSmithKline-Inc-v-The-Queen/Page1.html|publisher = Moore Stephens|date = 2010-08-11|accessdate = 2012-10-18|archive-url = https://archive.is/20130115011210/http://moorestephensresources.com.au/articles/386/1/GlaxoSmithKline-Inc-v-The-Queen/Page1.html#|archive-date = 2013-01-15|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While many [[tax professional]]s welcomed the SCC endorsement of a "business reality test", others had been expecting more specific guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = Drew Hasselback|title = Supreme Court of Canada adopts broad test on transfer pricing|url = http://business.financialpost.com/2012/10/18/supreme-court-of-canada-adopts-broad-test-on-transfer-pricing/|work=[[Financial Post]]|date = 2012-01-18|accessdate = 2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also speculation that the time may be ripe for the Crown and GSK to reach a settlement, rather than spend more time in pursuing a rehearing at the TCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tax Alert - Canada: Supreme Court of Canada sends GlaxoSmithKline transfer pricing case back to the Tax Court of Canada|url = http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Tax_Alert_2012_No_44/$FILE/TaxAlert2012No44.pdf|publisher = [[Ernst &amp; Young LLP]]|date = 2012-10-19|accessdate = 2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was ultimately settled on 12 January 2015, prior to the TCC's rehearing of the matter, with details of the agreement remaining confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Julius Melnitzer |title= GlaxoSmithKline transfer pricing case settled|url= http://business.financialpost.com/2015/01/12/glaxosmithkline-transfer-pricing-case-settled/|newspaper= [[Financial Post]]|location= Toronto|date= 12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCC's statement that an arm's-length price can fall within an acceptable range of prices has also been seen as significant, and consistent with the 2010 OECD transfer pricing guidelines, as it appears to be contrary to the long-standing policy of the [[Canada Revenue Agency]] to express a preference for unweighted yearly averages of comparators’ pricing in such circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = Jonathan Crangle|title = Transfer Pricing: Supreme Court of Canada upholds Federal Court of Appeal in Canada v GlaxoSmithKline Inc.|url = http://www.taxchambers.ca/transfer-pricing-supreme-court-of-canada-upholds-federal-court-of-appeal-in-canada-v-glaxosmithkline-inc/|publisher = Tax Chambers|date = 2012-10-18|accessdate = 2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the SCC's guidance to the TCC strongly suggests that Canadian courts must keep an eye on the bigger picture in making their transfer pricing determinations, and the determination of arm's-length pricing is quite distinct from the narrower concept of [[fair market value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Canada’s Supreme Court Releases First Transfer Pricing Decision in GlaxoSmithKline|url = http://www.osler.com/NewsResources/Canadas-Supreme-Court-Releases-First-Transfer-Pricing-Decision-in-GlaxoSmithKline/|publisher = [[Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt]]|date = 2012-10-19|accessdate = 2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When s. 69(2) was reenacted as s. 247(2)(a) and (c) in 1998, the test as to what was reasonable "in the circumstances" was removed. However, it has been contended that the quoted words are implicit in the comparative exercise mandated by the explicit adoption of the arm's-length principle in subsection 247(2),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = John J. Tobin|title = Canada’s Top Court Speaks on Transfer Pricing|url = http://www.torys.com/Publications/Pages/TX2012-3_Canadas_Top_Court_Speaks_on_Transfer_Pricing.aspx|publisher = [[Torys LLP]]|date = 2012-10-19|accessdate = 2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Tax Court of Canada]] has held that ''GlaxoSmithKline'''s reasoning continues to apply to s. 247 cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=McKesson Canada Corporation v. The Queen|link=|year=2013|court=tcc|num=404|format=|pinpoint=par. 121|parallelcite=|date=2013-12-20|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that s. 247 also contains a recharacterization rule at s. 247(2)(b) and (d) that has yet to be assessed in the Canadian courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bloom|first1= Brian|last2= Vincent|first2= François |year= 2012|title= Respecting the Dualistic Nature of Canada’s Two Transfer Pricing Rules: A Tax Policy and Legal Analysis|journal= Tax Management Transfer Pricing Report|volume= 21|issue= 7|pages= S-3{{endash}}S-20|publisher= |doi= |url= http://www.dwpv.com/~/media/Files/PDF/Article-Transfer-Pricing-Report.ashx|accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, it has been argued that the SCC erred in affirming the FCA's application of a reasonable business person test for the purpose of s.69(2), and that the SCC infused additional uncertainty as to which arm's length test applies (i.e., an empirical arm's length test or a reasonable business person test). These errors may require having the court overrule its decision in order to properly consider the Minister's question about the appropriateness of the reasonable business person test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Amir Pichhadze|year= 2013|title= Canada's Transfer Pricing Test in the Aftermath of GlaxoSmithKline Inc.: A Critique of the Reasonable Business Person Test|journal= International Transfer Pricing Journal|volume= 20|issue= 3|pages= 144{{endash}}162|publisher= |doi= |pmc= |ssrn= 2302606|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Daughters of Zelophehad''' ({{lang-he|בְּנוֹת צְלָפְחָד}}) were five sisters - '''Mahlah''', '''Noa''', '''Hoglah''', '''Milcah''', and '''[[Tirzah]]''' - mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]], (Numbers 27) who lived at the end of the [[Israelite]]s' [[the Exodus|Exodus]] from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] as they prepared to enter the [[Promised Land]] and who raised before the Israelite community the [[Legal case|case]] of a woman's right and obligation to [[Inheritance|inherit]] [[property]] in the absence of a male heir in the family. '''Zelophehad''' (meaning "dark shadow"), a man of the [[Tribe of Manasseh]], had five daughters but no sons, and therefore no male [[Heir|heirs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|26:33|HE}} [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0427.htm#3 27:3,] {{Bibleverse||Joshua|17:3.|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:The Daughters of Zelophehad.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Daughters of Zelophehad (illustration from the 1908 ''Bible and Its Story Taught by One Thousand Picture Lessons'')]]

==Biblical account==
The biblical text tells little of Zelophehad himself, save that he died during the 40 years when the Israelites were wandering in the [[wilderness]], and explicitly that he played no part in [[Korah|Korah's rebellion]].&lt;ref name="Bibleverse||Numbers|27:3.|HE"&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|27:3.|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Bibleverse||Numbers|16|HE}} does not in any case cite the tribe of Manasseh as being involved in the rebellion against [[Moses]].

Zelophehad's daughters petitioned Moses, [[Eleazar]] the [[Kohen|priest]], the [[Tribal chief|chieftains]], and the whole assembly, at the entrance of the [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tent of Meeting]] for their [[Women's rights|right]] to inherit his property rights in the [[Land of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|27:2&amp;ndash;4.|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zelophehad's daughters noted that their father Zelophehad had not taken part in Korah's rebellion, but only died ''in his own sin''.&lt;ref name="Bibleverse||Numbers|27:3.|HE"/&gt; Zelophehad's daughters argued that were they not to inherit, then Zelophehad's name would be lost to his clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|27:4.|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses took their case to [[Names of God in Judaism|God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|27:5.|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; God told Moses that the plea of Zelophehad's daughters was just, and that they should be granted their father's hereditary holding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|27:6&amp;ndash;7.|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the family heads of the clan of Manasseh's grandson [[Gilead]] appealed to Moses and the chieftains, arguing that if Zelophehad's daughters married men from another Israelite [[tribe]], then their share would be lost to the tribe of Manasseh and be added to the portion of the tribe into which they married.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|36:1&amp;ndash;3.|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; So Moses, at God's bidding, instructed the Israelites that the plea of the tribal leaders was just and that Zelophehad's daughters could marry anyone they wished, but only among the men of the tribe of Manasseh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|36:5&amp;ndash;6.|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zelophehad's daughters did as God had commanded in the instructions conveyed to Moses, and each married a son of an uncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|36:10&amp;ndash;11.|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Israelites entered the land, Zelophehad's daughters appeared before Eleazer the priest, [[Joshua]] (who by then had assumed leadership from Moses), and the chieftains, reminding them that God had commanded Moses to grant them a portion among their kinsmen, and Zelophehad's daughters received a portion in the holdings of Manasseh, probably on the east side of the [[Jordan River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Josh.|17:4&amp;ndash;6.|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rabbinical commentary==
In the [[Talmud]] and the [[Zohar]] the reference to Zelophehad having "died in his own sin" is used to equate him with the man executed for gathering sticks on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]],&lt;ref&gt;Shabbat 96b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zohar 3:205b" /&gt; but Sifri Zuta says that it cannot be known if he was.&lt;ref&gt;Sifri Zuta on {{Bibleverse||Numbers|15:32.|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Talmud, Rabbi Joshua interpreted that they petitioned first the assembly, then the chieftains, then Eleazar, and finally Moses, but Abba Chanan said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer that Zelophehad's daughters stood before all of them as they were sitting together.&lt;ref name="Bava Batra 119b"&gt;Bava Batra 119b.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zohar]] said that Zelophehad's daughters drew near to Moses in the presence of Eleazar and all the chieftains because they were afraid of Moses' anger at Zelophehad and thought that it might be contained in a public forum.&lt;ref name="Zohar 3:205b"&gt;Zohar 3:205b.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Zohar, Moses presented the case to God instead of deciding it himself out of modesty.&lt;ref name="Zohar 3:205b" /&gt;

A [[Baraita]] taught that Zelophehad's daughters were [[wisdom|wise]], [[Torah]] [[student]]s, and [[Righteousness|righteous]].&lt;ref name="Bava Batra 119b" /&gt; Another Baraita taught that Zelophehad's daughters were equal in merit, and that is why the order of their names varies in the text.&lt;ref name="Bava Batra 120a" /&gt; According to the [[Gemara]], they demonstrated their wisdom by raising their case in a timely fashion, just as Moses was expounding the [[law]] of [[levirate marriage]], or ''[[yibbum]]'', and they argued for their inheritance by analogy to that law.&lt;ref name="Bava Batra 119b" /&gt; The daughters also demonstrated their righteousness by marrying men who were fitting for them.&lt;ref name="Bava Batra 119b" /&gt;

==Scholarly views==
Two genealogies are given for Zelophehad by the Bible;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Book of Chronicles]], he is listed as a son of [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Manasseh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|7:14-15|}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other places where his genealogy is mentioned, he is listed as a son of Hepher, who was the son of [[Gilead (Biblical figure)|Gilead]], and therefore merely a descendant of Manasseh.&lt;ref&gt;for example, in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|17:3|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these genealogies record Zelophehad as being a member of the tribe of Manasseh. The apparent contradictions have been addressed by naming Zelophehad as a ''descendant'' rather than as ''the second [son]''.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

According to Shammai Feldman, Zelophehad and his daughters are a fiction created simply to illustrate some of the legal rules of inheritance;&lt;ref&gt;Shammai Feldman, "Biblical motives and sources" in "[[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]]" 22 (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish textual scholars regard the accounts concerning Zelophehad's daughters as accretions added to the earlier [[priestly source]] narrative by writers from the same pro-[[Kohen|Aaronid]] [[wiktionary:religiopolitical|religio-political]] group.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Book of Numbers''&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Zelophehad and his daughters in the earlier census&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 26:33&lt;/ref&gt; is marked by the [[King James Version]]&lt;ref&gt;usually with brackets or italics&lt;/ref&gt; as having dubious authenticity.

According to ''Tevye's Daughters: No Laughing Matter'', author [[Jan Lisa Huttner]] makes a connection from the five daughters of Zelophehad to Tevye's five daughters in ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''. Both [[Jane Austen]] and [[Sholem Aleichem|Solomon Rabinowitz]] presumably read the story of Zelophehad’s five daughters and it is highly likely that [[Joseph Stein]] read it at one time too. The number five, five daughters—or to be exact, five dowries—is the same number God also bestowed on Solomon Rabinowitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huttner|first1=Jan Lisa|title=Tevye's Daughters: No Laughing Matter|date=September 18, 2014|publisher=FF2 Media|location=New York, NY|asin=B00NQDQCTG|url=https://www.amazon.com/Tevyes-Daughters-No-Laughing-Matter-ebook/dp/B00NQDQCTG/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Names===
Linguistic scholars are divided in regard to the [[etymology]] of the name ''Zelophehad''. Following the reading of the [[masoretic text]], some scholars suspect that the name is derived from a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] term meaning ''first rupture'', in the sense of being a first-born son.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; Most scholars, following the [[septuagint]]'s rendering of the name as ''salpaad'', believe that the name was derived from the Hebrew term ''salpahad'', literally meaning ''shadow from terror'';&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; many of these scholars interpret this as referring to the shadow created by a shelter, and so interpret the name as ''protection from terror'',&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; but others interpret it as meaning ''the bringer of terror is shadowed''.&lt;ref&gt;Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In regard to the names of the daughters, scholars largely are in agreement; ''Malah'' means "fat"/"infirmity", ''Noa'' means "movement", ''Milcah'' means "queen", ''Tirzah'' means "pleasing", ''Hoglah'' means "dancing" (though for this reason it is also the word for ''[[partridge]]'').

==Legal issues==
Legal advice, concerning the inheritance rights and obligations of the daughters of Zelophehad, is given twice in the Biblical account. On the first occasion, the topic is about inheritance when there are no male children, while the topic of the second occasion is [[levirate marriage]], and property inheritance remaining within a clan (not the tribe). The daughters are mentioned a third time, in the [[Book of Joshua]], where they are simply portrayed as being given land in the territory of Manasseh, to which their inheritance entitled them;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Joshua|17:3-6|}}&lt;/ref&gt; the text is unclear in regards to which part of Manasseh's territory they were granted land, except that it wasn't in [[Gilead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Joshua|17:6|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inheritance when there are no male children===
In the Biblical account, earlier regulations had specified that [[property]] was to be inherited by heirs who were male, but the daughters were the only children of their now deceased father, and so they came to the door of the ''[[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tent of Meeting]]'' and asked [[Moses]], [[Eleazer]], the [[tribal chief]]tains, and the rest of the ''congregation'', for advice on what was to be done, as there were no obvious male heirs;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|26:1-2|}}, {{Bibleverse||Numbers|27:4.|}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Talmud]], opinions vary as to whether this means that the daughters petitioned all of these groups at the same time, with them gathered together, or if it means that the daughters first petitioned the ''congregation'', then the chieftains, then Eleazar, and finally petitioned Moses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bava Batra]] 119b; Rabbi Eliezer supports the former, Rabbi Joshua supports the latter&lt;/ref&gt;

The biblical text states that Moses asked [[Hashem]] to rule on the issue;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|27:5|}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Zohar argues that Moses had presented the case to Hashem, rather than deciding it himself, because Moses was modest.&lt;ref name="Zohar 3:205b"/&gt; The biblical account continues by stating that Moses was told by Hashem that the daughters should be considered their father's heirs, and that the general case holds - if there are no sons, the daughter (or daughters) should inherit - and if there are no children at all, the inheritance should pass to the man's brothers, and if there are no brothers it should pass to the ''nearest relative in his clan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|27:5-9|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maimonides]], and other rabbinical commentators, extrapolated this into the conclusion that, if they exist, then sons and their descendants are the heirs of an individual, but if they do not it would be any daughters or their descendants, and if these do not exist then it would be the individual's father, and if he is no longer alive then the rule concerning heirs applies to him - the father's sons (the individual's brothers) and their descendants have priority, followed by the father's daughters (the individual's sisters), followed by the father's father (the individual's grandfather), and so on.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Inheritance''&lt;/ref&gt; However, although this was how the [[Pharisees]] saw the biblical implication, the [[Sadducees]] argued that if there were only female descendants of an individual's sons, and the sons themselves were dead, then the individual's daughters had the right to inherit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Evidently the regulations preferring male descendants may have come to be disregarded in some respects, as the [[Book of Job]], which textual scholars date to the fourth century BCE, states in its epilogue&lt;ref&gt;Job 42:15&lt;/ref&gt; that Job's daughters were given equal inheritance rights to his sons,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and the [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]] always gave daughters the same rights as sons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; By the [[Middle Ages]] it came to be a tradition to evade the inequality between daughters and sons via a [[legal fiction]], in which the father claims that he is indebted to his daughter for a certain sum of money, and that this debt is due by him and his heirs, and then makes a formal agreement that this debt is to be paid upon his death, either in cash or as a proportion of his estate equal to half the share of one of the sons;&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''daughter in jewish law''&lt;/ref&gt; by this legal mechanism, the daughter would either gain a share in her father's estate, or a sum of money equal to its value.

===Endogamous and exogamous inheritance===
Later in the narrative of the Book of Numbers, the elders of the [[Gilead (tribal group)|clan of Gilead]] petitioned Moses and the tribal chieftains for advice, because they were concerned that if Zelophehad's daughters married men from another [[Israelites|Israelite tribe]], the property that the daughters had inherited the right to would become the property of the other tribe, and would be lost from the [[tribe of Manasseh]], to which Zelophehad had belonged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|36:1-4|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative continues by stating that Hashem gave Moses a response to give to the elders, namely that the daughters must each marry someone from the Gilead clan, but they are otherwise unrestricted in their choice;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|36:5-6|}}&lt;/ref&gt; the narrative also states that the general case was to be applied - that inheritances cannot pass between tribes, but instead any female that inherits land is compelled to marry someone from the same clan as her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|36:7-9|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative's coda mentions that the daughters each marry one of the sons of their uncles;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|36:10-11|}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[gemara]] states that the daughters had demonstrated their righteousness in doing so, as these men were fitting for them, and hadn't married earlier as they were waiting for suitable husbands.&lt;ref name="Bava Batra 119b" /&gt;

The biblical restriction of heiresses to commit [[endogamy]] was repealed by the classical [[rabbi]]s;&lt;ref name="Bava Batra 120a"&gt;Bava Batra 120a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ta'anit (Talmud)|Ta'anit]] 30b&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rabbah bar Nahmani|Rabbah]] argued that the rule only applied to the period that [[Canaan]] had been divided between the tribes, and had therefore become redundant, especially as the laws concerning the territory were in abeyance anyway, owing to the destruction of [[Temple in Jerusalem|the Temple]].&lt;ref name="Bava Batra 120a"/&gt; Thus in all forms of Judaism following the [[Oral Law]], women are allowed to marry whom they wish, including [[exogamy|exogamously]], whether they have gained an inheritance or not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3575">In [[economics]], '''depreciation''' is the gradual decrease in the economic [[value theory|value]] of the [[capital stock]] of a firm, nation or other entity, either through physical depreciation, obsolescence or changes in the demand for the services of the capital in question. If the capital stock is &lt;math&gt;K_t&lt;/math&gt; in one period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, [[gross investment|gross (total)  investment]] spending on newly produced capital is &lt;math&gt;I_t&lt;/math&gt; and depreciation is &lt;math&gt;D_t&lt;/math&gt;, the capital stock in the next period, &lt;math&gt;K_{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;K_t + I_t - D_t&lt;/math&gt;. The [[net (economics)|net]] increment to the capital stock is the difference between gross investment and depreciation, and is called [[net investment]].

==Models==
In economics, the value of a capital asset may be modeled as the [[present value]] of the flow of services the asset will generate in future, appropriately adjusted for uncertainty. Economic depreciation over a given period is the reduction in the remaining value of future goods and services.

Under certain circumstances, such as an unanticipated increase in the price of the services generated by an asset or a reduction in the [[Annual effective discount rate|discount rate]], its value may increase rather than decline. Depreciation is then negative.

Depreciation can alternatively be measured as the change in the ''market'' value of [[capital (finance)|capital]] over a given period: the market price of the capital at the beginning of the period minus its market price at the end of the period.

Such a method in calculating depreciation differs from other methods, such as straight-line depreciation in that it is included in the calculation of [[implicit cost]], and thus [[economic profit]].

Modeling depreciation of a durable as delivering the same services from purchase until failure, with zero scrap value (rather than slowing degrading and retaining [[residual value]]), is referred to as the '''light bulb model''' of depreciation, or more colorfully as the [[one-hoss shay]] model, after a poem by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]], about a carriage which worked perfectly for exactly one hundred years, then fell completely apart in an instant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=1904 |title=OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms - One-hoss shay |accessdate=2007-10-02 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National accounts==
[[File:AbschrUSAJBRDengl.png|thumb|[[Consumption of fixed capital]] in percent of [[GDP]], [[Economy of Germany|Germany]], [[Economy of Japan|Japan]], [[Economy of the United States|United States]], computed from data of [[EU commission|Ameco]] data base.]]
In [[national accounts]] the decline in the aggregate [[Physical capital|capital stock]] arising from the use of fixed assets in production is referred to as [[consumption of fixed capital]] ('''CFC'''). Hence, CFC is equal to the difference between aggregate [[gross fixed capital formation]] ([[Gross (economics)|gross]] [[investment]]) and net fixed capital formation ([[net investment]]) or between [[Gross National Product]] and [[Net National Product]]. Unlike depreciation in business accounting, CFC in national accounts is, in principle, not a method of allocating the costs of past expenditures on fixed assets over subsequent accounting periods. Rather, fixed assets at a given moment in time are valued according to the remaining benefits to be derived from their use.

A '''diving horse''' is an attraction that was popular in the mid-1880s,&lt;ref name="texasescapes.com"&gt;[http://www.texasescapes.com/MikeCoxTexasTales/192-Jumper-and-Diving-Horse.htm The Great Carver Show, Jumper, Diving Horse, and Sonora Webster the Horse Jumper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in which a [[horse]] would dive into a pool of water, sometimes from as high as 60 feet.&lt;ref name="Dedicated to The Diving Horses"&gt;[http://www.steel-pier.com/dedicated_to_the_diving_horses.htm Dedicated to The Diving Horses&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421210301/http://www.steel-pier.com/dedicated_to_the_diving_horses.htm |date=April 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[William Frank Carver|William "Doc" Carver]] "invented" horse diving exhibitions. Allegedly, in 1881 Carver was crossing a bridge over [[Platte River]] ([[Nebraska]]) which partially collapsed. His horse fell/dove into the waters below, inspiring Carver to develop the diving horse act. Carver trained various animals and went on tour. His partner, Al Floyd Carver, constructed the ramp and tower and Lorena Carver was the first rider. [[Sonora Webster Carver|Sonora Webster]] joined the show in 1924. She later married Al Floyd Carver. The show became a permanent fixture at [[Atlantic City]]'s popular venue [[Steel Pier]]. There, Sonora, Al and Lorena continued the show following his death.

In 1931, Sonora and her horse Red Lips lost their balance on the platform. Sonora survived the fall, but was blinded (caused by [[Retinal detachment|detached retinas]] in both eyes). She continued horse-diving while blind. A film based on her life (as recounted in her memoir ''[[A Girl and Five Brave Horses]]''), ''[[Wild Hearts Can’t Be Broken]]'', was released in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/04/nyregion/the-horse-was-in-charge.html?src=pm | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first=Bill | last=Kent | title=The Horse Was in Charge | date=4 May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal welfare==
A horse diving show was an in residence act held at New Jersey's Steel Pier.  Pressure from animal rights activists, and declining demand led to the act being permanently shuttered in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="texasescapes.com"/&gt; The horses sometimes dove four times a day, seven days a week.&lt;ref name="Dedicated to The Diving Horses"/&gt; An attempt in 2012 to revive the shows at [[Steel Pier]] was halted when animal welfare advocates petitioned the owners not to hold the shows. The president of the [[Humane Society of the United States]] stated: "This is a merciful end to a colossally stupid idea."&lt;ref name=Goldberg&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Barbara|title=Atlantic City high-diving horses revival scrapped after protests|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/16/uk-usa-horses-diving-idUSLNE81F01020120216|accessdate=20 March 2013|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loading of the pier==
Atlantic City's Steel Pier was also used to mount a measuring device to monitor changes in the sea level of the Atlantic Ocean. However, changes in sea level at the Pier turned out to have been caused by the weight of the crowds gathered to watch the diving horses. Measurements from 1929 to 1978 indicated sea level rise – when the crowds were regular and caused the Pier to settle slightly in the soft, sandy bottom – except during the horse-jumping hiatus from 1945 to 1953 when the lack of regular crowds allowed the Pier to rise slightly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2012/eposters/eposter/os21b-1720/ "Apparent Sea Level Rise Due To Loading Of The Atlantic City Steep Pier By Spectators Viewing (1929-1978) Diving Horses".] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121054330/http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2012/eposters/eposter/os21b-1720/ |date=January 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary examples==
in [[Lake George, New York]], the [[Magic Forest]] theme park hosts only remaining diving horse feature in New York state.  It has been in operation since 1977, originally featuring a horse named Rex, later replaced by a [[gelding]] named Lightning. The manager states, "There is no rider, no prods, no electrical jolts, and no trap doors."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2174#sthash.sxwDv0MI.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt; The horse jumps twice daily during a two-month season and has the rest of the year off.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedivinghorse.com/about-horse-diving.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film==
The 1991 film '[[Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken]] tells the story of [[Sonora Webster Carver]], who rode diving horses.

The Diving Horse Act was mentioned in the 1986 comedy film, &lt;i&gt;[[Back to School]]:&lt;/i&gt;

The '''''Duke Law Journal''''' is a student-run [[law review]] published at [[Duke University School of Law]]. The journal publishes general-interest articles and student notes in eight issues each year.

== Overview ==
The ''Duke Law Journal'' is currently ranked as the 8th most cited law review, according to the [[Washington and Lee University School of Law]]'s rankings.&lt;ref&gt;http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The journal was established in March 1951 as the ''Duke Bar Journal'' and obtained its current title in 1957. In 1969, the journal published its inaugural Administrative Law Symposium issue, a tradition that continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us {{!}} Duke Law Journal|url=http://dlj.law.duke.edu/history/|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 1 of the ''Duke Bar Journal'' had two issues and 259 pages. In 1959, the journal grew to four issues and 649 pages, growing again in 1970 to six issues and 1263 pages. More recently, Volume 60 had just over 1900 pages in eight issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us {{!}} Duke Law Journal|url=http://dlj.law.duke.edu/history/|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Staff and selection of membership ==
The journal selects approximately 40 second-year law students for membership. This selection occurs through Duke Law's casenote competition. At the end of the first year, students interested in joining the journal submit a 14-page paper analyzing an assigned case, which current journal members grade. Of the group that submitted notes, the ''Duke Law Journal'' then selects one third of its members from those who have the highest first-year [[grade point average]], one third whose GPA and note score were highest in combination, and the final third based on the remaining highest note scores.

Students who wish to join the ''Duke Law Journal'' after the casenote competition (i.e., in their third year) may do so by writing a note of publishable quality and submitting it through the "note-on" process. The journal has occasionally accepted one or two students per year in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlj.law.duke.edu/membership/|title=Membership {{!}} Duke Law Journal|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symposium ==
The ''Duke Law Journal'' hosts a yearly symposium on administrative law. Past topics have included administrative law in the Bush Administration, reform in the immigration courts, environmental law, and the role of the FCC in regulating the Internet.

A '''European Union Association Agreement''' (for short, '''Association Agreement''' or '''AA''') is a treaty between the [[European Union]] (EU), its [[Member States of the European Union|Member States]] and a non-EU country that creates a framework for co-operation between them.  Areas frequently covered by such agreements include the development of political, trade, social, cultural and security links. The legal base for the conclusion of the association agreements is provided by art. 217 [[TFEU]] (former art. 310 and art. 238 [[Treaty establishing the European Community|TEC]]).

Association Agreements are broad framework agreements between the EU (or its predecessors) and its [[EU member states|member states]], and an external state which governs their bilateral relations.  The provision for an association agreement was included in the [[Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]], as a means to enable co-operation of the Community with the United Kingdom, which had retreated from the treaty negotiations at the [[Messina Conference]] of 1955.  According to the [[European External Action Service]], for an agreement to be classified as an AA, it must meet several criteria:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401163320/http://www.eeas.europa.eu/association/docs/agreements_en.pdf|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/association/docs/agreements_en.pdf|title=Association Agreements|date=11 May 2011|accessdate=9 August 2013|archivedate=2012-04-01|publisher=[[European External Action Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|1. The legal basis for their conclusion is Article 217 TFEU (former art. 310 and art. 238 TEC)&lt;br/&gt;
2. Intention to establish close economic and political cooperation (more than simple cooperation);&lt;br/&gt;
3. Creation of paritary bodies for the management of the cooperation, competent to take decisions that bind the contracting parties;&lt;br/&gt;
4. Offering Most Favoured Nation treatment;&lt;br/&gt;
5. Providing for a privileged relationship between the EC and its partner;&lt;br/&gt;
6. Since 1995 the clause on the respect of human rights and democratic principles is systematically included and constitutes an essential element of the agreement;&lt;br/&gt;
7. In a large number of cases, the association agreement replaces a cooperation agreement thereby intensifying the relations between the partners. |European External Action Service}}

The EU typically concludes Association Agreements in exchange for commitments to political, economic, trade, or human rights reform in a country.  In exchange, the country may be offered [[tariff]]-free access to some or all EU markets (industrial goods, agricultural products, etc.), and financial or technical assistance. Most recently signed AAs also include a [[Free Trade Agreement]] (FTA) between the EU and the third country.

Association Agreements have to be accepted by the European Union and need to be [[Ratification|ratified]] by all the [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]] and the state concerned.

==Names and types==
AAs go by a variety of names (e.g. Euro-Mediterranean Agreement Establishing an Association, Europe Agreement Establishing an Association) and need not necessarily even have the word "Association" in the title.  Some AAs contain a promise of future EU membership for the contracting state.

The first states to sign such an agreement were [[Greece]] (1961)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:P:1963:026:0294:0342:FR:PDF|title=Accord créant une association entre la Communauté économique européenne et la Grèce|language=French|date=18 February 1963|accessdate=19 July 2013|journal=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|volume=P 26/1963|pages=294–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Turkey]] in (1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:P:1964:217:3687:3697:FR:PDF|title=Accord créant une association entre la Communauté économique européenne et la Turquie – Protocole n° 1 : protocole provisoire – Protocole n° 2 : protocole financier – Acte final – Déclarations|language=French|date=29 December 1964|accessdate=19 July 2013|journal=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|volume=P 217/1964|pages=3687–3697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent history, such agreements have been signed as part of two EU policies: [[Stabilisation and Association Process]] (SAp) and [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] (ENP).

The countries of the [[western Balkans]] (official candidates [[Albania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]], and potential candidates [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Kosovo]]{{ref label|status|a|}}) are covered by SAp.  All six have "Stabilisation and Association Agreements" (SAA) with the EU in force.

The countries of the [[Mediterranean]] ([[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], the [[Palestinian Authority]], [[Syria]], [[Tunisia]]) and Eastern Europe neighbours ([[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], but excluding Russia that insists on creating four [[EU-Russia Common Spaces]]) are covered by ENP.  Seven of the Mediterranean states have a "Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association" (EMAA) with the EU in force, while Palestine has an interim EMAA in force.&lt;ref name=euro-med&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/external_relations/relations_with_third_countries/mediterranean_partner_countries/r14104_en.htm|title=Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements|accessdate=21 July 2013|publisher=[[European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Syria initialled an EMAA in 2008, however signing has been deferred indefinitely.  Negotiations for a Framework Agreement with the remaining state, Libya, have been suspended.  [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]], of the [[Eastern Partnership]], have Association Agreements in force.  [[Armenia]] completed negotiations for a AA in 2013 but decided not to sign the agreement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/armenia/|title=Armenia - Trade - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Azerbaijan has been negotiating an AA.

Both the SAA and ENP AP are based mostly on the EU's [[acquis communautaire]] and its promulgation in the co-operating states legislation.  Of course the depth of the harmonisation is less than for full EU members and some policy areas may not be covered (depending on the particular state).

In addition to these two policies, AAs with [[free-trade agreement]] provisions have been signed with other states and [[trade bloc]]s including [[Chile]], and South Africa.

}}The '''Foundation of Light''' (Previously called the ''SAFC Foundation'') is a [[Registered Charity]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and is the independent charitable [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] of professional [[Association football|football]] club [[Sunderland A.F.C.]] It is the biggest football charity in the UK.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sirbobmurray.com/timeline/safc-foundation-founded/|title=SAFC Foundation founded — Sir Bob Murray|website=www.sirbobmurray.com|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded on 6 September 2001 by Sunderland chairman [[Bob Murray (businessman)|Bob Murray]]. The charity's patron is [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|HRH Sophie, Countess of Wessex]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/sunderland-afc-gets-royal-recognition-1-7113892|title=Sunderland AFC gets royal recognition|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Chief executive officer]] is Lesley Spuhler OBE.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/business/business-news/business-interview-lesley-spuhler-chief-9265078|title=Business Interview: Lesley Spuhler, chief executive of the Foundation of Light|last=Ford|first=Coreena|date=2015-05-17|work=journallive|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1988, Sunderland took part in the 'Community Programme in Professional Football’, a scheme aimed at encouraging links between football clubs and their local communities. This became the 'Football in the Community' initiative in the early 1990s, which Sunderland were involved in from the beginning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In September 2001, Sunderland chairman Bob Murray announced the separation of Sunderland's charitable and community work from the mainstream club activity, andt the independent '''SAFC Foundation''' was created.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/apr/18/football.peterhetherington|title=Stadium of Light casts a dark shadow over Sunderland|last=Hetherington|first=Peter|date=2003-04-18|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation was initially supported with funding from Sunderland A.F.C., [[Northern Rock]] and the [[Coalfields Regeneration Trust]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Foundation's main charitable aim is to:&lt;blockquote&gt;Advance the education (including the social and physical training) of children and young persons attending schools and clubs in the area, through the use of football and other sports activities as educational tools and thereof to provide facilities for meetings, lectures and classes for the benefit of such young children and young persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?subid=0&amp;regid=1089333|title=Charity Details|website=beta.charitycommission.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Within a year, the Foundation had a staff of 70 who engaged with school children in 280 schools, predominantly in [[Sunderland]] and [[County Durham]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Initially, classrooms within the [[Academy of Light]] were used for the Foundation, as well as two mobile [[Double-decker bus|double-decker buses]] containing specialist classrooms. The custom-built ''Centre for Light'' opened in 2004, a £1.6m learning facility built within the [[Stadium of Light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/a-bit-of-class-at-the-stadium-of-light-1-1118129|title=A bit of class at the Stadium of Light|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre included five learning areas supporting up to 120 visiting children per day.

The Foundation regularly undertakes various fund-raising activities. In 2011, it collaborated with [[Durham Cathedral]] on a 'Carols of Light' event, which included music from acts as diverse as [[Thomas Allen (baritone)|Thomas Allen]] and [[The Futureheads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/dialogue/signposts/students/?itemno=13224|title=Carols of Light charity fundraising event - Durham University|website=www.dur.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the SAFC Foundation was rebranded as the Foundation of Light.

In 2015, the Foundation was granted permission to open a [[Free school (England)|free school]] next to the Stadium of Light. The Sunderland Centre for Opportunity (SCOO) would offer opportunities for vulnerable children who struggle in mainstream education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/11842392.Black_Cats__charity_to_open_free_school_beside_Sunderland_Stadium_of_Light/|title=Black Cats' charity to open free school beside Sunderland Stadium of Light|website=The Northern Echo|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, the [[Beacon of Light]] opened, and became the new official home of the Foundation of Light. The £20m, five-storey building, which sits alongside the Stadium of Light, includes indoor sports courts, indoor and outdoor [[artificial turf]] pitches, as well as classrooms and learning spaces.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/sunderland-afc-chairman-stewart-donald-takes-on-new-foundation-of-light-role-1-9391542|title=Sunderland AFC chairman Stewart Donald takes on new Foundation of Light role|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After purchasing the club in May 2018, Sunderland chairman [[Stewart Donald]] joined the Foundation of Light board of trustees on 11 October 2018.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Financials ==
In 2017, the Foundation of Light raised £11.1m and spent £4.1m. It had £17.8m in [[asset]]s and £5.5m in [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?subid=0&amp;regid=1089333|title=Charity Details|website=beta.charitycommission.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 130 employees and 42 volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?subid=0&amp;regid=1089333|title=Charity Details|website=beta.charitycommission.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 300,000 people have been helped by the Foundation since it was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://charitybank.org/charity-profiles/foundation-of-light|title=Foundation Of Light - Follow The Money|website=charitybank.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5972">{{Main article|Feudal land tenure}}
'''Frankalmoin''' or '''frankalmoigne''' was one of the [[feudal land tenure]]s in [[feudal]] [[Kingdom of England|England]]. Its literal meaning is "free pity/mercy", from Norman French ''fraunch aumoyne'', "free [[alms]]", from [[Late Latin]] ''eleemosyna'', from Greek {{lang|grc|ἐλεημοσύνη}} ("eleēmosynē"), "pity, alms", from {{lang|grc|ἐλεήμων}} ("eleēmōn") "merciful", from {{lang|grc|ἔλεος}} ("eleos"), "pity".&lt;ref&gt;Collins Dictionary of the English Language, London, 1986; Liddell &amp; Scott's Greek-English Lexicon, Oxford, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; By it an ecclesiastical body held land free of military service such as [[knight service]] or other secular or religious service, but sometimes in return for the religious service of saying prayers and masses for the soul of the grantor. Not only was secular service not due but in the 12th and 13th centuries jurisdiction over land so held belonged to the ecclesiastical courts, and was thus immune from royal jurisdiction.

In [[English law]], frankalmoign(e) was also known as "tenure in free alms". Gifts to religious institutions in free alms were defined first as gifts to God, then to the [[patron saint]] of the religious house, and finally to those religious serving God in the specific house.

The following example is from a charter of [[William de Redvers, 5th Earl of Devon|William de Vernon, 5th Earl of Devon]] (d.1217), to [[Quarr Abbey]]:&lt;ref&gt;Worsley, Sir Richard. ''History of the Isle of Wight'', London, 1781, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wOZWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PR133 appendix LXVI]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hanc donationem praedictis monachis in puram et perpetuam eleemosinam liberam ab omni servitio in perpetuum possidendam confirmavi.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In English:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have confirmed this donation to the foresaid monks in pure and perpetual mercy (i.e. "alms") free from all service in perpetual possession&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the above example makes clear it was a freehold tenure as it was held in perpetual possession, which is equivalent to "hereditable" in secular terms. Religious houses in receipt of free alms could not recognise a secular lord. The gift of land or other property made over to God and to a patron Saint was inalienable, and the relationship between the grantor and the religious house was subsidiary.

In the 12th century the institution came to be misused. Land could be donated to a church organization and then leased back to the donor, allowing the donor to avoid the feudal services due to his lord. Legal cases became so complicated that the [[Assize of Utrum]] was established in the middle of the 12th century to adjudicate claims.

[[Thomas de Littleton#Treatise on Tenures|Thomas de Littleton's ''Tenures'']], which perhaps appeared about 1470 as an update of a then century-old predecessor tract (the ''[[Old tenures]]''), said to have been written under [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], contains a section on Frankalmoin.

&lt;blockquote&gt;And they which hold in frank-almoign are bound of right before God to make orisons, prayers, masses, and other divine services, for the souls of their grantor or feoffor, and for the souls of their ancestors which are dead, and for the prosperity and good life and good health of their heirs, which are alive. And therefore they shall do no fealty to their lord ... because, that this divine service is better for them before God, than any doing of fealty; and also because that these words (frank-almoign) exclude the lord to have any earthly or temporal service, but to have only divine and spiritual service to be done for him, &amp;c.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = R. Hastings | last = Littleton | first = Thomas | title = Littleton's tenures: With notes explanatory of The Text of Littleton, and showing the recent alterations in the law | year = 1846 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Edward Coke]] commented on this in the first part of his ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Coke |first = Edward |authorlink = Edward Coke |editor-first = Steve |editor-last=Sheppard |title = The Selected Writings of Sir Edward Coke |url = http://www.dominiopublico.gov.br/download/texto/0462-02_Bk.pdf |accessdate = 2006-08-17 |isbn = 0-86597-316-4 |pages = 700–701 |chapter = The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England: Or A Commentary upon Littleton, Not the name of the Author only, but of the Law it selfe; section&amp;nbsp;138, Frankalmoin, part 5
|quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; published within his ''[[Commentary upon Littleton]]'', which he completed about a century and a half after its subject's first appearance. Coke provided cases and noted how practice related to Littleton's work had changed during that time.

Frankalmoin was the tenure by which the greater number of the monasteries and religious houses held their lands; it was expressly exempted from the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660]], by which the other ancient tenures were abolished, and it was the tenure by which the parochial clergy and many ecclesiastical and eleemosynary foundations held their lands through the 19th century.

As a form of donation, frankalmoin fell into disuse because on any alienation of the land the tenure was converted into [[socage]]. An apparent attempt was made to abolish frankalmoin in the [[Administration of Estates Act 1925]]; but in any case no fresh grants in frankalmoin, save by the Crown, were possible after ''[[Quia Emptores]]'' in 1290.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burn|first=Edward H.|last2=Cartwright|first2=John|last3=Cheshire|first3=Geoffrey C.|title=Cheshire and Burn's modern law of real property|year=2011|edition=18th|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ghent system''' is the name given to an arrangement in some countries whereby the main responsibility for [[welfare]] payments, especially [[unemployment benefits]], is held by [[trade union|trade/labor unions]], rather than a [[government agency]].

The system is named after the city of [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]], where it was first implemented. It is the predominant form of unemployment benefit in [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]] and [[Sweden]]. Belgium has a hybrid or "quasi-Ghent" system, in which the government also plays a significant role in distributing benefits. In all of the above countries, unemployment funds held by unions or labour federations are regulated and/or partly [[subsidy|subsidised]] by the national government concerned.

Because workers in many cases need to belong to a union to receive benefits, union membership is higher in countries with the Ghent system. Furthermore, the state benefit is a fixed sum, but the benefits from unemployment funds depend on previous earnings.

The Swedish state decreased its financial support to the unemployment funds (most of them union-run, a few funds aimed for small entrepreneurs and one independent fund) from January 2007, with the result being that membership fees to unemployment funds had to be raised considerably, and union density declined from 77% in 2006 to 71% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Anders Kjellberg (2011) [http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/3462138/2064087.pdf "The Decline in Swedish Union Density since 2007"] ''Nordic Journal of Working Life Studies'' (NJWLS) Vol. 1. No 1 (August 2011), pp. 67-93&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 the fund fees were restored to about the same level as before 2007. In 2015 Swedish union density was 69% and the density of union unemployment funds 73% (75% if the independent Alfa fund is added).&lt;ref&gt;Kjellberg, Anders and Ibsen, Christian Lyhne (2016) [https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/21682547/Kjellberg_og_Ibsen_2016_ur_Due_og_Madsen.pdf "Attacks on union organizing:  Reversible and irreversible changes to the Ghent-systems in Sweden and Denmark"] in Trine Pernille Larsen and Anna Ilsøe (eds.)(2016) ''Den Danske Model set udefra (The Danish Model Inside Out) - komparative perspektiver på dansk arbejdsmarkedsregulering'', Copenhagen: Jurist- og Økonomforbundets Forlag, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Gibraltar}}
The '''Gibraltar Constitution Order 1969''' was published on 30 May 1969 as an [[Order in Council]].

The [[constitution]] was the outcome of the Constitutional Conference chaired by [[Malcolm Shepherd, 2nd Baron Shepherd]] which lasted from July 16, 1968 to July 24. The [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarian]] members of the Constitutional Conference were: [[Joshua Hassan]], [[Aurelio Montegriffo]] and [[Abraham Serfaty (Gibraltarian)|Abraham Serfaty]] for the [[Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights]]; [[Robert Peliza]], [[Maurice Xiberras]] and legal advisor Sir Frederick Bennet for the [[Integration With Britain Party]]; and [[Peter Isola]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110607062502/http://www.gbc.gi/upload/pdf/Gib%201969%20Constitution.pdf The Gibraltar Constitution - 1969]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The move towards the 1969 Constitution was sparked off after the outcome of the [[Gibraltar sovereignty referendum, 1967|1967 sovereignty referendum]], where 99.19% of Gibraltarians voted against passing under Spanish sovereignty and in favour of retaining their link with Britain, with democratic local institutions and with Britain retaining its present responsibilities.

==Preamble==
[[File:Gibraltar 1969 Constitution Preamble stalagtite.jpg|thumb|The Gibraltar 1969 Constitution preamble engraved onto a [[stalactite]] at the [[Gibraltar Museum]].]]
The crucial feature of the 1969 Constitution for the Gibraltarians was the Preamble to the Order in Council promulgating the Constitution, in its final form began:

{{quote|Whereas Gibraltar is part of Her Majesty’s dominions and Her Majesty’s Government have given assurances to the people of Gibraltar that Gibraltar will remain part of Her Majesty’s dominions unless and until an Act of Parliament otherwise provides, and furthermore that Her Majesty’s Government will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of another state against their freely and democratically expressed wishes.}}

This Preamble has been called the "single most significant statement made on the sovereignty of Gibraltar since the signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]".&lt;ref name="gold19"&gt;{{cite book | title=Gibraltar: British or Spanish? | author=[[Peter Gold]] | publisher=Routledge | year=2005 | isbn=0-415-34795-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9YH_fLPu1MC | pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frontier closure==
{{See also|Disputed status of Gibraltar}}
Upon the request of the United Nations, Spain and the United Kingdom had been developing inconclusive talks about Gibraltar for the previous three years. Since 1954, the [[Government of Spain]] under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco]] had been applying increasingly restrictive measures in its relationships with Gibraltar. On 24 July 1968, it complained to the UN Secretary General claiming that the constitutional talks were a "further obstacle to the solution of Gibraltar's future", a statement that was rejected by the [[Government of the United Kingdom]].".&lt;ref name="gold19"/&gt; Shortly thereafter the frontier was closed by the Spanish Guardia Civil and chaos ensued as controls were implemented on travellers trying to use the ferry service at the port of Algeciras. This situation (which lasted into September 1968) was a precursor to the frontier closure implemented the following year.

The Constitution was published on 30 May 1969 and came into immediate effect. Elections were scheduled for 30 July. The Spanish government described the promulgation as an open disregard by the UK government of the UN Resolutions and a violation of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. On 6 July 1969, the decision to close the land border between [[Spain]] and Gibraltar was taken. Next day the decision was implemented.&lt;ref name="gold21"&gt;{{cite book | title=Gibraltar: British or Spanish? | author=[[Peter Gold]] | publisher=Routledge | year=2005 | isbn=0-415-34795-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9YH_fLPu1MC | pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closing of the border, together with various other restrictions, was a severe shock for the Gibraltarians, who became aware that across the frontier there was a hostile and threatening foreign power. The closure of the frontier would last thirteen years and was considered by the Gibraltarians as the last in a series of sieges held by Spain to attempt to secure the surrender of the town.

'''Global Infrastructure Partners''' (GIP) is an infrastructure  investment fund making both equity and selected debt investments. GIP is headquartered in New York City and its equity investments are in infrastructure assets in the energy, transport and water/waste sectors. GIP employs approximately 150 investment and operational professionals and has offices in New York, London and Sydney and operational headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.  In the aggregate, its portfolio companies employ approximately 21,000 people.

==History==
Global Infrastructure Partners was established in May 2006. Two of GIP's founding investors in its first fund, GIP I, were Credit Suisse and General Electric.  Each of these investors committed approximately 9% of the US$5.64 billion of GIP I's total committed capital.

The firm's first investment was announced in October 2006. It was a 50:50 joint venture between GIP and American International Group (AIG) to acquire London City Airport (LCY) for an undisclosed sum.  GIP announced the sale of LCY in February 2016 for a significant multiple of its 2006 acquisition price.

Subsequently, GIP has made two additional airport investments: the October 2009 acquisition of [[Gatwick Airport]], the second largest airport in the United Kingdom by passenger traffic, for £1.5 billion from [[BAA Limited|BAA]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/6394265/Gatwick-airport-sold-for-1.5bn.html|title=Gatwick airport sold for £1.5bn|accessdate=15 October 2012|publisher=The Telegraph|date=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8317662.stm|title=BAA agrees Gatwick airport sale |accessdate=15 October 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2012 acquisition of [[Edinburgh Airport]] for £807 million.&lt;ref name=bbc23412&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-17814024|title=Edinburgh Airport sold to Global Infrastructure Partners for £807m|accessdate=15 October 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc1612&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-18287180|title=Edinburgh Airport changes hands to Global Infrastructure Partners|accessdate=15 October 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, GIP has made a cross section of investments in other areas of the transport sector as well as the natural resource and power generation areas of the energy sector. These assets include sea ports, freight rail facilities, midstream natural resources and power generation businesses.
 
Global Infrastructure Partners' first fund, GIP I, completed its fund raising in May 2008 with $5.64 billion in investor capital commitments.  The fund became fully invested during 2012. 
In September 2012, GIP's second fund, GIP II, completed fund raising with US$8.25 billion in investor capital commitments, making it the largest independent infrastructure fund in the world at that time.&lt;ref name=reut31012&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/03/us-gip-infrastructure-idUSBRE89213S20121003|title=Global Infrastructure Partners raises record $8.25 billion|accessdate=15 October 2012|publisher=Reuters|date=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceeding what it had initially projected,&lt;ref&gt;Krouse, Sarah, and Ryan Dezember, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrock-goes-3-7-billion-deeper-into-pipelines-and-power-1485943380 "BlackRock Goes $3.7 Billion Deeper Into Pipelines and Power"], ''Wall Street Journal'', February 1, 2017. Retrieved 2017-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt; GIP's third fund—GIP III—completed fund raising in January 2017 with approximately $15.8 billion in investor capital commitments. 

==Current Investments==
As of September 2018, Global Infrastructure Partners had aggregate assets under management of approximately US$48 billion with its investments largely concentrated in [[OECD]] countries. At this time, the Fund's portfolio included investments in the following assets:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://global-infra.com/investments/ |title= Investments |accessdate= 16 October 2012 |publisher= Global Infrastructure Partners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32934">'''Gulargate''' was a 2012–2013 [[political corruption]] scandal in [[Azerbaijan]] involving civil servants and government officials of various levels, serving in positions as high as the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan]] and the [[Presidential Administration of Azerbaijan Republic|Presidential Administration]]. It flared up on 25 September 2012 after Azerbaijani lawyer and former university rector [[Elshad Abdullayev]] (now residing in [[France]]) posted a hidden camera video on [[YouTube]] showing his meeting with Member of Parliament [[Gular Ahmadova]] negotiating a bribe to secure a seat in the National Assembly for Abdullayev in the [[Azerbaijan parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]]. The scandal widened after a series of similar videos involving other officials and other cases of corruption were posted by Abdullayev at later dates, followed by sackings, arrests and deaths of some of those who appeared in the videos.&lt;ref name="pace"&gt;[http://www.assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2013/NYFf%C4%B1nalpressfjdoc1e.pdf Corruption as a threat to the Rule of Law]. Report by the PACE Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights. AS/Jur (2013) 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Gulargate" derives from the first name of now former MP Gular Ahmadova who appeared in the very first video. It was coined by Azerbaijani media on the day following the release of the first video&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioazadlyg.org/content/article/24720635.html Attorney General Investigating Gulargate Scandal]. Radio Liberty. 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; by analogy with the [[Watergate scandal]] of the 1970s. The term was later republished and used by English-language media outlets&lt;ref name="azerireport"&gt;[http://azerireport.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3740 Gulargate Grows as Ahmadova Threatens Ruling Party Members with Revelations]. Azeri Report. 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the corruption report of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|PACE]] Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights.&lt;ref name="pace"/&gt; Despite the term coinage, most videos are related to the kidnapping of Elshad Abdullayev's brother Mahir Abdullayev and not to Gular Ahmadova.

==Background==
Elshad Abdullayev, who holds a doctorate degree in jurisprudence, had been known as the rector of the [[Azerbaijan International University]] which functioned from 1997 to 2010 and for the last four years was a focus of investigation of the Attorney General's Office over reported cases of corruption and illegal student admission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.day.az/society/226544.html Ministry of Education Shut Down Azerbaijani University]. ''Day.az''. 1 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Abdullayev's older brother Mahir Abdullayev, an officer of the Ministry of State Security, was kidnapped, and a state investigation which linked his disappearance to the criminal activity of the gang led by [[Haji Mammadov]] did not yield any results.

In 2005, Elshad Abdullayev ran as a candidate from the ruling [[New Azerbaijan Party]] for a seat in the National Assembly of Azerbaijan.

Radio Liberty. 29 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 7 December 2012 interview to [[Radio Liberty]], Abdullayev said he had been forced to abandon his plan to win a seat in the parliament back in 2006 under pressure from the [[Presidential Administration of Azerbaijan Republic|Presidential Administration]]. Abdullayev had allegedly been told that the US Embassy demanded from the government of Azerbaijan that an opposition party candidate be given a chance to win a seat. Since the [[Musavat]] party leader [[Isa Gambar]], according to Abdullayev's recount, "could not be let into the parliament", the choice fell on Arzu Samadbeyli who ran from Abdullayev's constituency representing Musavat. The US Embassy in Azerbaijan denied these allegations.&lt;ref name="embassy"&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24792256.html Ramiz Mehdiyev's Verbal Duel with Elshad Abdullayev]. Radio Liberty. 7 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video postings==
In September 2012, Elshad Abdullayev appeared with a statement, saying that back in 2005 he had paid 2,000,000 [[US dollar]]s worth of a bribe requested from him by the state officials in return for finding his kidnapped brother and securing for Elshad Abdullayev himself a seat in the government in the upcoming parliamentary election. Abdullayev claimed to have paid it to the head of the Presidential Administration [[Ramiz Mehdiyev]] and that Member of Parliament [[Gular Ahmadova]] served as the intermediary. Abdullayev alleged the officials never acted on the agreement and did not return his money. Following these statements, Ahmadova accused Abdullayev of slander.&lt;ref name="firstvideo"&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/news/24719935.html A Video Accusing MP Gular Ahmadova Released]. Radio Liberty. 25 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Elshad Abdullayev posted his first footage on YouTube on 25 September 2012. The video featured himself, Member of Parliament Gular Ahmadova and her friend Sevinj Babayeva, sitting in an office and discussing events around the 2005 parliamentary election. Ahmadova is heard mentioning a prior arrangement made with Abdullayev and promising him a seat in the government in return for money. Abdullayev offers US$500,000, but Ahmadova insists that he pay US$1,000,000. During the conversation, Abdullayev attempts several times to get Ahmadova to mention Ramiz Mehdiyev as the eventual collector of the bribe, but she never explicitly confirms that.&lt;ref name="firstvideo"/&gt;

The video caused a major uproar in the local media. Ahmadova first claimed the video was a hoax and refused to make any further comments on it. She later admitted being in the video, but said the money discussed in fact referred to the restitution sum that Abdullayev had owed students of his defunct university and that Ahmadova pressured him to give her that money, so she would redistribute it among them accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Rashad Rustamov.

''Zerkalo''. 1 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; She voluntarily resigned as Member of Parliament, so as not to "hinder the investigation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24722524.html Gular Ahmadova Revoking Parliament Membership].

Radio Liberty. 4 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, she came under fire of offensive criticism from fellow members of the [[New Azerbaijan Party]] and felt the need to address herself to the President (the head of the party) in order for the insults to stop.&lt;ref name="azerireport"/&gt; Abdullayev said he was receiving threats after publishing the video.&lt;ref name="threat"/&gt;

Abdullayev released another video on 6 October 2012, in which Gular Ahmadova is heard talking about various high-ranking government officials compiling lists of MP candidates which they would like to see in the National Assembly following the election. Among those in charge of compiling these lists, she mentions Minister of Economic Development [[Farhad Aliyev]], Minister of Health Ali Insanov (both arrested on the eve of the 2005 election for planning a [[coup d'état]] and sentenced to imprisonment), Minister of Emergency Situations [[Kamaladdin Heydarov]], head of the Presidential Administration [[Ramiz Mehdiyev]], President [[Ilham Aliyev]], and First Lady [[Mehriban Aliyeva]]. Sevinj Babayeva confirms this in the video, which together with the first video appears to be a fragment of a single conversation. In the video, Gular Ahmadova also warns Abdullayev that there have been cases of "letting in MPs who would go on working with Ali Insanov and Hajibala (sic), so this time those MPs would not be let in".&lt;ref name="secondvideo"&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24730801.html Another Gular Ahmadova Video Published]. Radio Liberty. 6 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next video released on 21 October 2012, Abdullayev is seen with someone who calls himself Rovshan Abbasguliyev, a Ministry of Internal Affairs employee in the Seventh Division responsible for secret services. It is mentioned that there has been no progress in finding Mahir Abdullayev. The alleged Ministry employee admits that Mahir Abdullayev is kept in the Head Department against Organized Crime and that it is a normal practice for the department to "catch a person, shove them into a car and then notify their [family] that they're in the department". In the video, Elshad Abdullayev also inquires into the possibility of having his nephew hired by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The employee says this is possible for a bribe of 10,000 to 15,000 [[Azerbaijani manat|AZN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24746258.html Another Secret Video Published]. Radio Liberty. 21 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thirdvideo"&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24747275.html "This Is an Outrage; MIA Must Provide Explanation"]. Radio Liberty. 22 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Interior Ministry official Ehsan Zahidov confirmed that Rovshan Abbasguliyev indeed worked for the Seventh Division but was fired in 2008 for "serious violations of the work code". Zahidov noted that statements of a fired employee cannot possibly cast shadow on the Ministry or the Minister. Nevertheless, he promised that the issue would be looked into in light of the new evidence.&lt;ref name="thirdvideo"/&gt;

In early November 2012, three people were arrested with regard to Mahir Abdullayev's case, among them former assistant of the First Deputy of the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan Vagif Huseynov and businessman Arzu Kazimov. It was announced that these two had received a total of almost US$4 million from Elshad Abdullayev after promising to help him find his kidnapped brother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/news/24763853.html Three People Arrested in Relation to MSS Officer's Disappearance]. Radio Liberty. 7 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourth video, which Abdullayev released on 18 November 2012 and dated 2007, he is shown talking with a person who claims to be then chief justice of the Narimanov rayon court Aghababa Babayev. The latter promises "assistance" to Abdullayev in finding his brother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24784134.html Investigation Started with Regard to Judge in Abdullayev's Video]. Radio Liberty. 28 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Babayev did not deny having a conversation with Abdullayev, but alleged he had not said some of the things heard in the video and that the video must have been edited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24773145.html Elshad Abdullayev Turns from Parliament to Court]. Radio Liberty. 18 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth video came on 14 December 2012, where Abdullayev is having a conversation with Gular Ahmadova's friend Sevinj Babayeva alone. The video is said to have been made in the aftermath of the 2005 parliamentary election. Babayeva reveals to Abdullayev that following a phone call from Gular Ahmadova, Ramiz Mehdiyev arranged for police groups to arrive at her constituency and "take measures" to secure her victory and that this was done immediately. Babayeva also told Abdullayev not to worry, as she "saw [Ramiz Mehdiyev] accepting the money with her own eyes" and that Mehdiyev has the final say in whatever happens.&lt;ref name="fifthvideo"&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24798757.html Elshad Abdullayev's New Video Clarified 2005 Election]. Radio Liberty. 14 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on this, Gular Ahmadova's former opposition rival [[Eldar Namazov]] confirmed that in 2005 the police had attacked his observers in four polling stations and destroyed their protocols. The next day, they did the same at six more polling stations, according to Namazov, which allowed Ahmadova to announce her victory.&lt;ref name="fifthvideo"/&gt;

In the next video, published on 25 December 2012, Abdullayev is seen talking to Rovshana Aliyeva whom he claimed to be the personal assistant of businessman Arzu Kazimov, one of the three people detained with regard to Mahir Abdullayev's case in November 2012. In the video, she gives a call to a person named Zaur who, according to her, is the son of Arzu Kazimov and a "super guy" and who can help sort out Elshad Abdullayev's problems "in no time" on behalf of Arzu Kazimov. The Attorney General's Office later accused Kazimov of accepting US$1.5 million from Abdullayev for promising to set his brother free through his "connections" in the government.&lt;ref name="raliyeva"&gt;[http://vesti.az/news/165926 Rovshana Aliyeva: Elshad Abdullayev Offered 30,000 AZN to Testify Against Arzu]. ''Vesti.az''. 16 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to the video posting, Rovshana Aliyeva made a statement saying she had nothing to do with Arzu Kazimov and claimed Elshad Abdullayev had threatened her with a gun a number of times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24797921.html Elshad Abdullayev Published Fifth Video]. Radio Liberty. 25 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; During a court hearing on 16 July 2013, Rovshana Aliyeva admitted she had passed Arzu Kazimov's contacts to Elshad Abdullayev through the latter's younger brother Eldaniz who was also her acquaintance. She claimed being offered 30,000 AZN by Abdullayev in return for testifying against Arzu Kazimov in court and declining the offer.&lt;ref name="raliyeva"/&gt;

The following video, which was made in 2004, according to Abdullayev, and released on 21 January 2013, featured Arzu Kazimov talking in his office with Elshad Abdullayev and Mahir Abdullayev's father-in-law journalist Shamil Shahmammadov, chief executive of the [[AzerTaj]] news agency. Abdullayev claimed that this video is a proof of Kazimov serving as a "cashier" of the "death squadron" which kidnapped his brother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24879103.html Elshad Abdullayev Released Eighth Video and Statement]. Radio Liberty. 21 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullayev published another video on 20 February 2013. Dated 2004, it shows himself discussing his brother's fate with Rasim Ildyrymzadeh, assistant chief of the [[Heydar Aliyev Airport]] police department and a distant relative of the Interior Minister [[Ramil Usubov]]. In the video, Ildyrymzadeh repeatedly reassures Abdullayev, who seems in doubt, that his brother is alive and well and due to be released at the end of the month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24908075.html Recent Video by Elshad Abdullayev Mentions Ramil Usubov's Family Members]. Radio Liberty. 20 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of the video, Ildyrymzadeh said he had told Abdullayev what he knew at the time and never asked him for a bribe. He accused Abdullayev of being well informed of the details of his brother's kidnapping and even playing his role in it. The videos, Ildyrymzadeh alleged, were simply discussions of the facts that all involved parties were aware of.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24908585.html Rasim Ildyrymzadeh: Mahir Abdullayev Set Out with Elshad Abdullayev's Agreement]. Radio Liberty. 21 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next video from August 2004 released soon afterwards featured a man alleged to be the president's bodyguard named Saftar Kalantarov. Kalantarov demands US$3,000 from Abdullayev to fly to [[Saint Petersburg]]. As for Mahir Abdullayev's whereabouts, Kalantarov says he is held somewhere in [[Chechnya]] and promises to bring back video and photographs proving Abdullayev is alive and well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24914993.html Elshad Abdullayev Speaks of "President's Bodyguard"]. Radio Liberty. 28 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following video filmed in 2009 Elshad Abdullayev is seen submitting what he claimed to be a package containing all the records of payments he made in an attempt to locate his brother to a Ministry of National Security employee Rasul Rasulov and the latter signing for it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24926521.html Elshad Abdullayev Released Another Video]. Radio Liberty. 12 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 March 2013, Abdullayev published three more videos at once, all from the same period in 2007. People who introduced themselves as Ministry of National Security officers say they are willing to help Elshad Abdullayev in finding his brother. They claim that Mahir Abdullayev was not kidnapped, but arrested following complaints from his fellow officers. According to them, he is currently in custody in the Ministry under a different name. To have him released, they continue, Elshad Abdullayev needs to get in touch with the Minister himself and give him money in return for his brother's release. However, since the Minister is too difficult to contact, they suggest Abdullayev see someone named Sahib. Sahib, in turn, states during the meeting that Mahir Abdullayev has been taken hostage over a woman and that his kidnappers would agree to return him for money, but required safety guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24935265.html Accusations against MSS in New Videos by Elshad Abdullayev]. Radio Liberty. 21 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullayev's next posting came on 26 April 2013, which was the full version of his 2005 conversation with Gular Ahmadova.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24969332.html Full Video of Former AIU Rector with Former MP Gular Ahmadova]. Radio Liberty. 26 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullayev released another video on 16 June 2013. In the video, which apparently precedes the very first video featuring Gular Ahmadova, Sevinj Babayeva tells Abdullayev that he needs to pay Ahmadova US$500,000 to secure a seat in the National Assembly. She says that he needs to pay US$500,000 more to have a high position in the government assigned to his brother Mahir Abdullayev. Abdullayev replies he does not have the extra money she asks for, of which Babayeva immediately informs Ahmadova by phone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/news/25018511.html Elshad Abdullayev Released New Videos]. Radio Liberty. 16 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last video was published by Abdullayev on 1 October 2013. In this video, he is seen having a conversation with Sevinj Babayeva alone. Babayeva insists that "this whole thing has to be over by tonight", as "ordered personally by the President". She mentions the names of Ramiz Mehdiyev and Parliament speaker [[Ogtay Asadov]] in claiming that they expect Abdullayev to transfer another US$100,000 in return for making his clinic and his university "flourish" and his brother released from captivity. She assures Abdullayev that this time the money will not disappear and "they know perfectly well" that Babayeva knows First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva and her sister Nargiz Pashayeva, whom she can "always complain to". Babayeva says she assumes no responsibility and serves only as an intermediary. She tells Abdullayev that he has been criticized for cooperation with "too many people" on this matter, having gotten the President, Ramiz Mehdiyev and Ogtay Asadov involved in this affair, and for avoiding those that have voluntarily stepped forward to help him. She also quotes Gular Ahmadova in saying that "they [the people who request money from Abdullayev] have given her the life she always dreamed of."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/25123241.html New Video Mentions Ilham Aliyev and Ogtay Asadov]. Radio Liberty. 1 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government's response==
Soon after the publishing of the first video, the head of the Presidential Administration Ramiz Mehdiyev, who was described by Abdullayev as the puppet master of the elections, made a public statement on 3 October 2012, saying that the mentioning of his name in the video is someone's "well-thought out provocation" and that "such troublemakers will be punished regardless of who they are".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24727797.html Ramiz Mehdiyev Commented on Video Controversy]. Radio Liberty. 3 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Abdullayev's accusation of rigging the election under pressure from the US Embassy, Mehdiyev said this "a product of his sick mind" and that Abdullayev is "no one" for him to discuss these issues with.&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt;

Members of the ruling New Azerbaijan Party described the authors and participants of the videos as "fraudsters" and emphasized the provocative nature of the video postings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24801035.html Huseyn Pashayev: Ramiz Mehdiyev's Name Keeps Being Mentioned by Fraudsters].

Radio Liberty. 14 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, on 7 March 2013, Abdullayev himself was charged with attempted crime and bribe giving. It was said that Abdullayev voluntarily paid Vagif Huseynov (one of the three men arrested in November 2012) US$1 million to make use of the latter's connections in the Cabinet of Ministers. The money allegedly had already been returned to Abdullayev.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24923372.html "Criminal Case Started Just to Hush Elshad Abdullayev Down].

==Death of Sevinj Babayeva==
Sevinj Babayeva, born 1973, was a friend of Gular Ahmadova's. She held a Ph.D. degree in law and was the editor and parliament reporter for the newspaper ''Kheyr va Shar'' in the late 1990s. At the time of the scandal, Babayeva was the director of the Sabir Library in Baku.&lt;ref&gt;Faid Majid. [http://www.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/213311/ MP Gular Ahmadova Expelled from New Azerbaijan]. Caucasian Knot. 28 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a month after the release of the first video, Babayeva was fired from her post. A library official said Babayeva's contract had expired and the library chose not to renew it due to "flaws in Babayeva's work".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zerkalo.az/2012/direktor-biblioteki-imeni-m-a-sabira-sevindzh-babaeva-uvolena-s-dolzhnosti/ Director of Sabir Library Sevinj Babayeva Fired]. ''Zerkalo''. 18 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It noteworthy that at the time of being fired, Babayeva had been outside of Azerbaijan for nearly a month.

After the release of the video in which she is having a one-on-one conversation with Elshad Abdullayev and repeatedly mentions Ramiz Mehdiyev's name, it was announced that Babayeva had disappeared. On 24 December 2012, the Attorney General's Office initiated an international search through [[Interpol]] on an unrelated case of fraud allegedly committed by Babayeva in 2009.&lt;ref name="sbburied"&gt;[http://www.radioazadlyg.org/content/article/24810884.html Sevinj Babayeva Buried in Lokbatan Cemetery].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 2012, Azerbaijani media outlets reported that Sevinj Babayeva had died in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24810660.html Did Sevinj Babayeva Died or Was She Killed?]. Radio Liberty. 28 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; An official investigation later revealed that Babayeva had left Azerbaijan on the insistence of Gular Ahmadova following the release of the first video in September.

Sevinj Babayeva introduced herself as Meryem Solmaz and from that point on was known by that name. She had been complaining of heart problems since 16 November 2012, receiving treatment at various clinics. On 28 December 2012, she finally checked in the Medicana International Istanbul Hospital where she was taken by Ağlayan. Babayeva was admitted with cardiovascular and pulmonary collapse, of which she died later that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haqqin.az/news/3091 Attorney General's Blames Gular Ahmadova for Sevinj Babayeva's Death].

==Gular Ahmadova's trial==

In April 2013, Elshad Abdullayev wrote an open letter with regard to his brother's disappearance, in which he named an alleged perpetrator, Akif Chovdarov, a general of the Ministry of National Security. Elshad Abdullayev described Chovdarov as the "top leader of the criminal gang of kidnappers". According to him, Chovdarov demanded that Mahir Abdullayev pay him US$2 million in order to keep silent about Abdullayev spending leisure time with popular singer Matanat Isgandarli at Garabulag, the infamous private resort in northern Azerbaijan where Colonel Haji Mammadov detained and murdered those he kidnapped. The letter then talks about Chovdarov succeeding at kidnapping Mahir Abdullayev with the help of Matanat Isgandarli in October 2003.&lt;ref name="azeriru"&gt;[http://www.azeri.ru/papers/contact_az/109708/ Another Bomb by Elshad Abdullayev]. ''Azeri.ru''. 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elshad Abdullayev described Akif Chovdarov as a person who indulges every order and desire of the highest-ranking government officials. Abdullayev claims that in addition to kidnappings and killings, Chovdarov, who also has Russian citizenship, runs a profitable wood business in the [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]], [[Russia]], on behalf of the said officials, despite not being supposed to engage in business being a National Security officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24965058.html ...Accuses Akif Chovdarov of Kidnappings and Killings]. 23 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullayev named Akif Chovdarov as the person behind the assassinations of [[Elmar Huseynov]] (which was previously also claimed by [[Eynulla Fatullayev]]) and [[Rafiq Tağı]] and the assault and intimidation of opposition journalists Agil Khalil and [[Khadija Ismayilova]].&lt;ref name="azeriru"/&gt;

In November 2015, General Chovdarov was fired and later arrested following the government's unrelated crackdown on corruption and extortion among high-ranking officials of the Ministry of National Security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haqqin.az/news/56619 Akif Chovdarov Expelled from MNS]. ''Haqqin.az''. 7 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://haqqin.az/news/57076 Akif Chovdarov Arrested and Detained at Narimanov Remand]. ''Haqqin.az''. 14 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expert opinion==
Political scientist Arastun Orujlu of the Sharg-Garb Research Centre described the scandal as a result of an ongoing struggle for power between various political clans.&lt;ref name="secondvideo"/&gt;

Lawyer Ayyub Karimov thinks the delay in locating Mahir Abdullayev stems from the fact that the people involved in the kidnapping have powerful connections in the government or police forces. He likened it to the series of kidnappings orchestrated by [[Haji Mammadov]], an officer of the Internal Affairs Ministry, in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24908892.html Apparent Mysteries in Human Kidnappings].

{{Contract law}}
An '''implied-in-fact contract''' is a form of an implied [[contract]] formed by non-verbal conduct, rather than by explicit words. The [[United States Supreme Court]] has defined it as "an agreement 'implied in fact'" as "founded upon a meeting of minds, which, although not embodied in an express contract, is [[Inference|inferred]], as a fact, from conduct of the parties showing, in the light of the surrounding circumstances, their tacit understanding."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co. v. United States|261|592|1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the parties may not have exchanged words of agreement, their conduct may indicate that an agreement existed.  

For example, if a patient goes to a doctor's appointment, his actions indicate he intends to receive treatment in exchange for paying reasonable/fair doctor's fees. Likewise, by seeing the patient, the doctor's actions indicate he intends to treat the patient in exchange for payment of the bill. Therefore, it seems that a contract actually existed between the doctor and the patient, even though nobody spoke any words of agreement. (They both agreed to the same essential terms, and acted in accordance with that agreement. There was mutuality of [[Consideration under American law|consideration]].) In such a case, the court will probably find that (as a [[Question of fact|matter of fact]]) the parties had an implied contract. If the patient refuses to pay after being examined, he will have [[breach of contract|breached]] the implied contract. Another example of an implied contract is the payment method known as a [[letter of credit]].

Generally, an implied contract has the same legal force as an [[express contract]]. However, it may be more difficult to prove the existence and terms of an implied contract should a dispute arise. In some [[jurisdiction]]s, contracts involving [[real estate]] may not be created on an implied-in-fact basis, requiring the transaction to be in writing.  

[[Unilateral contract]]s are often the subject matter of these types of contracts where acceptance is being made by beginning a specified task.

==Potential conduct implying implied contract==
* A prior history of similar agreements.
* When recipient accepts something of value knowing other party expects payment.

The '''Insolvency Regulation''' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000R1346:en:HTML (EC) 1346/2000] is an [[EU Regulation]] concerning the rules of jurisdiction for opening insolvency proceedings in the [[European Union]]. It determines which member states' courts have jurisdiction.

==Content==

The [[Regulation (European Union)|EC Regulation]] on Insolvency Proceedings 2000 was passed on 29 May 2000 and came into effect on 31 May 2002.&lt;ref name=ECReg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32000R1346|title=Council regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings|publisher=Eur-Lex|date=|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EC Regulation, as its name applies, operates between member states of the [[European Union]], and focuses upon creating a framework for the commencement of proceedings and for the automatic recognition and co-operation between the different member states.  Unusually for a European regulation, the EC Insolvency Regulation does not seek to harmonise insolvency laws between the different member states.

Like the [[UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency]], the EC Regulation also employs the concept of a centre of main interest (or "COMI").  The definition of the COMI is left to member states in their implementation of the Regulation, but paragraph (13) of the preamble states: 'The "centre of main interests" should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of his interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties.'  If the COMI of an entity is outside of the European Union then the insolvency proceedings are not subject to the Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;''Re the Arena Corporation Ltd'' [2003] EWHC 3032 (Ch.), affirmed on appeal ([2004] EWCA Civ 371).&lt;/ref&gt;  In relation to [[corporation|companies]] there is a [[presumption (law)|presumption]] that the registered office will be the COMI of the company, but this presumption can be (and often is) [[rebuttal|rebutted]].&lt;ref&gt;''Re AIM Underwriting Agencies'' [2004] EWHC Civ 2114; ''Re TXU Europe German Finance BV'' [2005] BCC 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EC Regulation does not define insolvency, but it does define insolvency proceedings as being 'collective insolvency proceedings which entail the partial or total divestment of a debtor and the appointment of a liquidator'.&lt;ref&gt;Article 1(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 3 divides proceedings into main proceedings and territorial proceedings.  The main proceedings are accorded extraterritorial effect throughout the European Union.  One of the concerns which has been expressed in relation to the EC Regulation is that (other than a reference to the [[European Court of Justice]]) there is no mechanism for determining which set of proceedings are to be regarded as the main proceedings if two or more jurisdictions claims that their own proceedings are the main proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd (Case C-341/04), [2006] ECR 1-701&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency Law|publisher=Jordans|author=Andrew Keay and Peter Walton|edition=2nd|year=2011|page=400|isbn=978-1846611193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding the intellectual capital in an enterprise allows leveraging of its intellectual assets.&lt;ref&gt;Khavand Kar, Jalil &amp; Khavandkar, Ehsan. (2009), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BnseAgAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Intellectual Capital: Management, Development and Measurement Models]". Ministry of Science, Research and Technology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For a corporation, the result will optimize its [[stock price]].

The [[International Financial Reporting Standards|IFRS]] (International Financial Reporting Standards) committee developed the International Accounting System 38 with the purpose of prescribing the accounting treatment for intangible assets. IAS 38.8 defines an intangible asset as an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. An asset is a resource that is controlled by the entity as the result of past events (for example purchase or self-creation) and from which future economic benefits (inflows of cash or other benefits) are expected.

==Classification==
Intellectual capital is normally classified as follows:

*'''[[Human capital]]''', the value that the employees of a business provide through the application of [[Skill|skills]], [[know-how]] and [[expertise]].&lt;ref name="Maddocks"&gt;Maddocks, J. &amp; Beaney, M. 2002. See the invisible and intangible. Knowledge Management, March, 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Human capital is an organization’s combined human capability for solving business problems and exploiting its [[Intellectual Property|intellectual property]]. Human capital is inherent in people and cannot be owned by an organization. Therefore, human capital can leave an organization when people leave, and if the [[management]] has failed to provide a setting where others can pick up their know-how. Human capital also encompasses how effectively an organization uses its people resources as measured by [[creativity]] and [[Innovation]].
*'''[[Structural capital]]''', the supportive non-physical infrastructure, processes and [[Database|databases]] of the organisation that enable human capital to function.&lt;ref name="Maddocks" /&gt; Structural capital includes processes, [[Patent|patents]], and [[Trademark|trademarks]], as well as the organization’s image, [[Organizational structure|organization]], [[information system]], and proprietary [[software]] and databases. Because of its diverse components, structural capital can be classified further into organization, process and innovation capital. [[Organizational capital]] includes the organization philosophy and systems for leveraging the organization’s capability. Process capital includes the techniques, procedures, and programs that implement and enhance the delivery of goods and services. Innovation capital includes [[intellectual property]] such as patents, trademarks and [[Copyright|copyrights]], and intangible assets.&lt;ref&gt;Edvinsson, L. &amp; Malone, M.S. 1997. Intellectual Capital: Realizing your Company’s True Value by Finding Its Hidden Roots. New York: Harper Business.&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual properties are protected commercial rights such as patents, [[Trade secret|trade secrets]], copyrights and trademarks. Intangible assets are all of the other talents and theory by which an organization is run.
*'''[[Relational capital]]''', consisting of such elements as [[customer]] relationships, supplier relationships, trademarks and [[Trade name|trade names]] (which have value only by virtue of customer relationships) [[License|licences]], and [[Franchising|franchises]]. The notion that customer capital is separate from human and structural capital indicates its central importance to an organization’s worth.&lt;ref&gt;Skyrme, D.J. 1998. Valuing Knowledge: Is it Worth it?&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the relationships a business maintains with its customers and suppliers is also referred as goodwill, but often poorly booked in corporate accounts, because of accounting rules.&lt;ref&gt;Marc M. Levey and Steven C. Wrappe:  Transfer Pricing, Rules, Compliance and Controversy, 2nd edition; CCH, Wolters Kluwer, 2007, p.129-139]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The intangible nature of many knowledge products and processes, in combination with the increasing importance of their value in corporate balance sheets leads to a growing interest in management of intellectual capital. Creating, shaping and updating the stock of intellectual capital requires the formulation of a strategic vision, which blends together all three dimensions of intellectual capital (Human, Structural and Relational Capital) within the organisational context through exploration and exploitation, measurement and disclosure&lt;ref&gt;Khavandkar, Ehsan, Theodorakopoulos, Nicholas, Hart, Mark, &amp; Preston, Jude (2016). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137465191_14 Leading the Diffusion of Intellectual Capital Management Practices in Science Parks]. In H. Shipton, P. Budhwar, P. Sparrow, &amp; A. Brown (Eds.), Human Resource Management, Innovation and Performance (pp. 213–231). London: Palgrave Macmillan UK.&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, the organisational value of intellectual capital is developed via an ongoing and emergent process focused on the capability to leverage, develop and change the dimensions&lt;ref&gt;Subramaniam, Mohan, &amp; Youndt, Mark (2005). [http://amj.aom.org/content/48/3/450.abstract The Influence of Intellectual Capital on the Types of Innovative Capabilities]. Academy of Management Journal, 48(3), 450–463.&lt;/ref&gt;. The management of intellectual capital is conceptualised as occurring via a multiple stage process, governed by an evolutionary logic. The intellectual capital management is defined as a cycle of four inter-related sets of practices: Strategic Alignment, Exploration and Exploitation, Measurement and Reporting of intellectual capital&lt;ref&gt;Khavand Kar, Jalil &amp; Khavandkar, Ehsan (2013), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BnseAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA387&amp;pg=PA387#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Intellectual Capital: Management, Development and Measurement Models]", 3rd edition, Ministry of Science, Research and Technology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Exploitation==
The management of intellectual capital is conceptualised as occurring via a multiple stage process, governed by an evolutionary logic&lt;ref&gt;Khavandkar, Ehsan., Theodorakopoulos, Nicholas., Hart, Mark., &amp; Preston, J.

Sparrow, &amp; A. Brown (Eds.), Human Resource Management, Innovation and Performance (pp. 213–231). London: Palgrave Macmillan UK.&lt;/ref&gt;. For a business, translating the potential of its intellectual capital is crucial.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick H. Sullivan: Value-Driven Intellectual Capital: How to Convert Intangible Corporate Assets into Market Value; Wiley, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;   Works that focus on the subset, namely the [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, and [[trade secret]]s, ignore the benefits of their use with the business.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Merges, Peter S. Menell, Mark A. Lemley: Intellectual Property in the Technological Age, 3rd ed.; Aspen 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "intellectual capital" is not yet common; other terms include "intangible assets".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Sherman: Harvesting Intangible Assets: Uncover Hidden Revenue in Your Company's Intellectual Property; AMACOM. Oct. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; While corporate reports often stress the value and the know-how of its staff, this crucial asset cannot be considered property. A term "[[Workforce]]-in-place" can be used as a category when companies with their staff are purchased.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Smith and Russell Parr (2005): Intellectual Property. Valuation, Exploitation, and Infringement Damages, 4th edition; Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Without that category, most of the excess purchase price over the tangible [[book value]] would just appear as [[goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]]. In order to profit from intellectual capital, [[knowledge management]] has become a task for management.&lt;ref&gt;Edna Pasher and Tuvya Ronen (2011): The Complete Guide to Knowledge Management: A Strategic Plan to Leverage Your Company’s Intellectual Capital; Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Often, intellectual capital, or at least rights to it, are moved off-shore for exploitation, which entails risks that are hard to value.&lt;ref&gt;Gio Wiederhold, Amar Gupta, and Erich Neuhold: "Offshoring and Transfer of Intellectual Property"; [[Information Resources Management Journal]] (IRMJ); Vol.23 No.1, January–March 2010, pp.74-93&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of rights to intellectual capital to offshore [[Subsidiary|subsidiaries]] is a major enabler of [[Tax avoidance|corporate tax avoidance]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuven S. Avi-Yonah: Statement to Congress; University of Michigan School of Law, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, U.S. Congress, 20 Sep.
2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
An intellectual capital audit is an [[audit]] of a company’s intellectual capital to monitor and oversee the intellectual capital of a firm in order to capitalize on intellectual capital already within the company, and to identify opportunities to increase the intellectual capital of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Brooking, A. (1996) Intellectual Capital, Core Assets for the Third Millennium Enterprise, International Thomson Business Press, London, pp.86&lt;/ref&gt;

Early methods of intellectual capital measurement include the balanced scorecard framework (BSC), the Skandia Navigator, and the Intangible Asset Monitor. Additionally, the Value-Added Intellectual Coefficient method (VAIC) was introduced in 1993 to measure the ''value'' created by intellectual capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gianpaolo Iazzolino|last2=Domenico Laise|date=2013-10-21|title=Value added intellectual coefficient (VAIC): A methodological and critical review|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/JIC-12-2012-0107|journal=Journal of Intellectual Capital|volume=14|issue=4|pages=547–563|doi=10.1108/jic-12-2012-0107|issn=1469-1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Libellus responsionum''''' ([[Latin]] for "little book of answers") is a papal letter (also known as a papal rescript or [[decretal]]) written in 601 by [[Pope Gregory I]] to [[Augustine of Canterbury]] in response to several of Augustine's questions regarding the nascent church in [[Anglo-Saxon England]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''Libellus'' is sometime designated as JE 1843, and/or by its [[incipit]] "Per dilectissimos filios meos". See [http://works.bepress.com/david_freidenreich/18/ P. Jaffé, ''Regesta pontificum Romanorum ab condita ecclesia ad annum post Christum natum MCXCVIII'', 2 vols, second edition, eds F. Kaltenbrunner (to a. 590), P. Ewald (to a. 882), S. Löwenfeld (to a. 1198) (Leipzig, 1885–1888)], no. 1843. It is edited by P. Ewald and L.M. Hartmann in [http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb00000536.html?pageNo=332&amp;sortIndex=040%3A010%3A0002%3A010%3A00%3A00 ''Gregorii I papae Registrum epistolarum'', 2 vols, MGH Epp. 1–2 (Berlin, 1891–1899), vol. II, pp. 332–43 (no. 11.56a)].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Libellus'' was reproduced in its entirety by [[Bede]] in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', whence it was transmitted widely in the [[Middle Ages]], and where it is still most often encountered by students and historians today.&lt;ref&gt;P. Meyvaert, "Bede’s text of the ''Libellus responsionum'' of Gregory the Great to Augustine of Canterbury", in ''England before the Conquest: studies in primary sources presented to Dorothy Whitelock'', eds P. Clemoes and K. Hughes (Cambridge, 1971), pp. 15–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Before it was ever transmitted in Bede's ''Historia'', however, the ''Libellus'' circulated as part of several different early medieval [[Collections of ancient canons|canon law collections]], often in the company of texts of a [[penance|penitential]] nature.

The authenticity of the ''Libellus'' (notwithstanding [[Saint Boniface|Boniface's]] suspicions, on which see below) was not called into serious question until the mid-twentieth century, when several historians forwarded the hypothesis that the document had been concocted in England in the early eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;See, most importantly, S. Brechter, ''Die Quellen zur Angelsachsenmission Gregors des Großen: Eine historiographische Studie'', Beiträge zur Geschichte des alten Mönchtums und des Benediktinerordens 22 (Munster, 1941), and M. Deanesly and P. Grosjean, "The Canterbury edition of the answers of Pope Gregory I to Augustine", in ''The journal of theological studies'' 10 (1959), 1–49. For a review of scholarship that has challenged Gregory's authorship see M. D. Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version of Pope Gregory I’s ''Libellus responsionum'' (JE 1843)", in ''Zeitschrift der Savigny-Stiftung für Rechtsgeschichte. Kanonistische Abteilung'' 100 (2014), pp. 62–111, at pp. 62–73.&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been shown, however, that this hypothesis was based on incomplete evidence and historical misapprehensions. In particular, twentieth-century scholarship focused on the presence in the ''Libellus'' of what appeared to be an impossibly lax rule regarding [[consanguinity]] and marriage, a rule that (it was thought) Gregory could not possibly have endorsed. It is now known that this rule is not in fact as lax as historians had thought, and moreover that the rule is fully consistent with Gregory's style and mode of thought.&lt;ref&gt;K. Ubl, ''Inzestverbot und Gesetzgebung: die Konstruktion eines Verbrechens (300–1100)'', Millennium-Studien 20 (Berlin, 2008), pp. 219–51; Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", pp. 73–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Gregory I's authorship of the ''Libellus'' is generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;P. Meyvaert, "Diversity within unity, a Gregorian theme", in ''The Heythrop journal'' 4 (1963), pp. 141–62; B. Müller, ''Führung im Denken und Handeln Gregors des Grossen'', Studien und Texte zu Antike und Christentum 57 (Tübingen, 2009), pp. 341–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The question of authenticity aside, manuscript and textual evidence indicates that the document was being transmitted in Italy by perhaps as early as the beginning of the seventh century (i.e. shortly after Gregory I's death in 604), and in England by the end of the same century.

==Creation==

The ''Libellus'' is a reply by Pope Gregory I to questions posed by Augustine of Canterbury about certain disciplinary, administrative, and sacral problems he was facing as he tried to establish a [[bishopric]] amongst the [[Kent|Kentish people]] following the initial success of the [[Gregorian mission]] in 596.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Wallace-Hadrill, Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People: A Historical Commentary (Oxford, 1988), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern historians, including Ian Wood and Rob Meens, have seen the ''Libellus'' as indicating that Augustine had more contact with native British Christians than is indicated by Bede's narrative in the ''Historia Ecclesiastica''.&lt;ref&gt;I. Wood, Ian, "Augustine and Aidan: Bureaucrat and Charismatic?", in ''L'Église et la Mission au VIe Siècle: La Mission d'Augustin de Cantorbéry et les Églises de Gaule sous L'Impulsion de Grégoire le Grand Actes du Colloque d'Arles de 1998'' (Paris, 2000), p. 170; R. Meens, "A Background to Augustine's Mission to Anglo-Saxon England", in: ''Anglo-Saxon England'' 23 (1994), 5–17, at p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's original questions (no longer extant) would have been sent to Rome around 598, but Gregory's reply (i.e. the ''Libellus'') was delayed some years due to illness, and was not composed until perhaps the summer of 601.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', 3rd edition (Oxford, 1971), pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Libellus'' may have been brought back to Augustine by [[Laurence of Canterbury|Laurence]] and [[Peter of Canterbury|Peter]], along with letters to the king of Kent and his wife and other items for the mission.&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars have suggested that the ''Libellus'' may in fact never have reached its intended recipient (Augustine) in Canterbury.&lt;ref&gt;P. Meyvaert, "Le Libellus responsionum à Augustin de Cantorbéry: une oeuvre authentique de Saint Grégoire le Grand", in ''Grégoire le Grand: actes de le Colloque international du Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Chantilly, Centre culturel Les Fontaines, 15– 19 septembre 1982'', eds J. Fontaine, R. Gillet, and S. Pellistrandi (Paris, 1986), pp. 543–50; Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Meyvaert, for example, has noted that no early Anglo-Saxon copy of the ''Libellus'' survives that is earlier than Bede's ''Historia ecclesiastica'' (ca 731), and Bede's copy appears to derive not from a Canterbury file copy but rather from a Continental canon law collection.&lt;ref&gt;Meyvaert, "Bede’s Text".&lt;/ref&gt; This would be strange had the letter arrived in Canterbury in the first place. A document as important to the fledgling mission and to the history of the Canterbury church as the ''Libellus'' is likely to have been protected and preserved quite carefully by Canterbury [[scribe]]s; yet this seems not to have been the case. Meyvaert therefore suggested that the ''Libellus'' may have been waylaid on its journey north from Rome in 601, and only later arrived in England, long after Augustine's death.&lt;ref&gt;Meyvaert, "Le Libellus responsionum à Augustin de Cantorbéry", pp. 547 and 550.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is supported by the surviving manuscript and textual evidence, which strongly suggests that the ''Libellus'' circulated widely on the Continent for perhaps nearly a century before finally arriving in England (see below). Still, the exact time, place, and vector by which the ''Libellus'' arrived in England and fell into the hands of Bede (and thence his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'') is still far from certain, and scholars continue to explore these questions.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent assessment of these questions see Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", pp. 101–04.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==

Gregory does not appear to have provided the ''Libellus'' with a title. This is not unusual since the work is a letter and Gregory was not in the habit of titling his many letters. "''Libellus responsionum''" is the name given the letter by Bede in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'',&lt;ref&gt;Bede, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Book 2, chapter 1 (ed. Plummer, vol. I, p. 76).&lt;/ref&gt; and most modern commentators translate Bede's [[nomenclature]] as "Little book of answers" or "Little book of responses". "''Libellus''" can also be translated as "letter";&lt;ref&gt;See C.T. Lewis and C. Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'' (Oxford, 1879), s.v., sense II.B.6.&lt;/ref&gt; thus "Letter of answers" is another possible translation.

==Contents==

The ''Libellus'' consists of a series of responses (''responsiones'') by Gregory to "certain jurisprudential, administrative, jurisdictional, liturgical and ritual questions Augustine was confronted with as leader of the fledgling English church".&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The numbering and order of these responses differ across the various versions of the ''Libellus'' (see below). But in the most widely known version (that reproduced in Bede's ''Historia Ecclesiastica'') there are nine responses, each of which begins by re-stating or paraphrasing Augustine's original questions.&lt;ref name=BedeChp27&gt;Bede, ''History of the English Church'', pp. 71–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's first response addresses questions about the relationship of a [[bishop]] to his clergy and vice versa, how gifts from the [[laity]] to the church should be divided amongst the clergy, and what the tasks of a bishop were.&lt;ref name=Bede72&gt;Bede, ''History of the English Church'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The second response addresses why the various northern European churches of which Augustine was aware had differing customs  and liturgies, and what Augustine should do when he encounters such differences. The third response was in answer to questions about the proper punishment of [[sacrilege|church robbers]].&lt;ref name=Bede73&gt;Bede, ''History of the English Church'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth and fifth response deal with who might marry whom, including whether it was allowed for two brothers to marry two sisters, or for a man to marry his step-sister or step-mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Johnson's translation of the Libellus responsionum (A collection of all the ecclesiastical laws, canons, answers, or rescripts, with other memorials concerning the government, discipline and worship of the church of England, from its first foundation to the Conquest ...)|pages=69–71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pdQGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| accessdate=8 July 2014 |location=London|publisher=Oxford |year=1850|origyear=1720}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth response addresses whether or not it was acceptable for a bishop to be [[consecration|consecrated]] without other bishops present, if the distances involved prevented other bishops from attending the ceremony.&lt;ref name=Bede74&gt;Bede, ''History of the English Church'', pp. 74–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh response deals with relations between the church in England and the church in [[Gaul]].&lt;ref name=Bede76a&gt;Bede, ''History of the English Church'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The eighth response concerns what a pregnant, newly delivered, or menstruating woman might do or not do, including whether or not she is allowed to enjoy sex with her husband and how long after child-birth she has to wait to re-enter a church.&lt;ref name=Bede76b&gt;Bede, ''History of the English Church'', pp. 76–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The last response answers questions about whether or not men might have communion after experiencing a sexual dream, and whether or not priests might celebrate [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] after experiencing such dreams.&lt;ref name=Bede81&gt;Bede, ''History of the English Church'', pp. 81–3.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional chapter, not included by Bede in his ''Historia'' is known as the "Obsecratio": it contains a response by Gregory to Augustine's request for [[relic]]s of the local British martyr [[Sixtus (British martyr)|Sixtus]]. Gregory responds that he is sending relics of Pope [[Pope Sixtus II|Sixtus II]] to replace the local saint's remains, as Gregory has doubts about the actual saintly status of the British martyr. Although the authenticity of the "Obsecratio" has occasionally been questioned, most modern historians accept that it is genuine.&lt;ref&gt;N. Brooks, ''The Early History of the Church of Canterbury: Christ Church from 597 to 1066'' (London, 1984), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later use==

In the early seventh century an augmented version of the [[Dionysius Exiguus|Dionysian]] conciliar and decretal collections was assembled in [[Bobbio]], in northern [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Elliot pp. 97"&gt;Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", pp. 97–9.&lt;/ref&gt; To this canon law collection — known today as the ''[[Collections of ancient canons#Collection of Dionysius Exiguus|Collectio canonum Dionysiana]] Bobiensis''&lt;ref&gt;This collection exists today in a single manuscript datable to the late ninth century: Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, S. 33 sup.&lt;/ref&gt; —there was appended at some time a long series of additional papal documents and letters, including the ''Libellus responsionum'' and ''[[Synodicon Vetus|Libellus synodicus]]''. Some scholars date the addition of this series of documents to as early as the seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;P. Landau, "Kanonessammlungen in der Lombardei im frühen und hohen Mittelalter", in ''Atti dell’ 11° congresso internazionale di studi sull’alto medioevo, Milano, 26–30 ottobre 1987'', 2 vols. (Spoleto 1989), vol. I, pp. 425–57, at p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus Zechiel-Eckes has even suggested the first half of the seventh century as the date for when the addition was made, that is  only shortly after the ''Bobiensis''’s initial compilation and at most only fifty years after Gregory’s death.&lt;ref&gt;K. Zechiel-Eckes, ed., ''Die Concordia canonum des Cresconius, Studien und Edition'', 2 vols., Freiburger Beiträge zur mittelalterlichen Geschichte 5 (Frankfurt am Main 1992), vol. I, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; If Zechiel-Eckes's dating is correct, it would make the ''Collectio Bobiensis'' the earliest surviving witness by far to the ''Libellus''.&lt;ref name="Elliot pp. 97"/&gt;

How and when the ''Libellus'' eventually reached England is not clear. It is not known if the original letter ever reached Augustine, its intended recipient. Bede assumed that it had, though he is rather vague on specifics at this point.&lt;ref&gt;Bede, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Book 2, chapter 1 (ed. Plummer, vol. I, p. 48): ''Nec mora, congrua quaesitui responsa recepit'' ("He soon received proper answers to his questions").&lt;/ref&gt; On the strength of Bede's word alone many later historians have claimed that the ''Libellus'' reached Augustine in a timely fashion;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 109; P. H. Blair, ''The World of Bede'' (Cambridge, 1990), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; however, as mentioned above, recent scholarship has brought this assumption into serious question. In any event, some version of the letter seems to have been available in England by the late seventh century, for it was then that it was quoted by [[Theodore of Tarsus]], Archbishop of Canterbury, in a series of judgments known today as the ''[[Paenitentiale Theodori]]''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Flechner, "The making of the Canons of Theodore", in ''Peritia'' 17–18 (2003–2004), pp. 121–43, at pp. 136–38.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Theodore found a copy of the ''Libellus'' already at Canterbury; however, given that no one in England previous to Theodore's archiepiscopacy seems to have known of the ''Libellus'', it is equally plausible that the ''Libellus'' was one of the texts that Theodore brought with him from Italy when he arrived in Canterbury in 669. It is known that Theodore brought numerous books with him from Italy, and that at least one of these books was a canon law collection very much like the one prepared at Bobbio some decades earlier (i.e. the ''Bobiensis'').&lt;ref&gt;M. Brett, "Theodore and the Latin Canon Law", in ''Archbishop Theodore: Commemorative Studies on His Life and Influence'', Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England 11 (Cambridge, 1995), pp. 120–40, shows that Theodore used a collection of the type known as the "enlarged ''Dionysiana''", which is just the type of collection that the ''Bobiensis'' is.&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot has speculated that Theodore introduced a ''Bobiensis''-type collection to Canterbury in the second half of the seventh century, and thereby finally delivered the ''Libellus'' (as part of the ''Bobbiensis'') to its originally intended destination.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", pp. 101–03.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is supported by the fact that it was only shortly after Theodore's tenure at Canterbury that Anglo-Saxons begin to demonstrate knowledge of the ''Libellus''.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", pp. 103–04.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bede inserted the entire text of the ''Libellus'' into book I of his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' (completed ca. 731), where it makes up the bulk of chapter 27.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace-Hadrill, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Bede also appears to have relied upon the ''Libellus'' while writing his prose ''[[Vita Sancti Cuthberti (Bede)|Vita Sancti Cuthberti]]'' in about the year 720.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, ''World of Bede'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Where Bede acquired his copy of the ''Libellus'' is not known, but it seems that by the early eighth century it was beginning to be read widely throughout northern England.&lt;ref&gt;For the suggestion that [[Ecgbert (bishop)|Archbishop Ecgberht of York]] may have known the ''Libellus'', see Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", pp. 103 n. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later Middle Ages, the text of the ''Libellus'' was used to support the claims of the monks of the [[Canterbury Cathedral]] [[cathedral chapter|chapter]] that the chapter had always included monks, back to the founding of the cathedral by Augustine. But the ''Libellus'' does not explicitly say that the cathedral chapter should be composed of monks, only that the monks that were members of the chapter should live in common and have some other aspects of monastic life.&lt;ref name=Brooks90&gt;Brooks, ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy over authenticity==

Twentieth-century scholarship's focus on the doubt expressed by [[Saint Boniface|Boniface]] regarding the authenticity of the ''Libellus'' has led to the widely held belief that a general atmosphere of suspicion surrounded the ''Libellus'' in the Middle Ages. In fact, Boniface appears to have been the only medieval personality to have ever expressed doubt about the authorship of this letter.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", pp. 62–73.&lt;/ref&gt; As missionary to the Germanic peoples of Europe and legate of the papal see, Boniface spent much of his later life in Continental Europe, where he encountered many canonical traditions that were unfamiliar to the Anglo-Saxons and that appeared to Boniface out of step with his knowledge of church tradition. The ''Libellus'' represented one such tradition. Boniface in fact had very practical reasons for questioning the ''Libellus''. He had witnessed its recommendations being exploited by certain members of the Frankish nobility who claimed that the ''Libellus'' permitted them to enter into unions with their aunts, unions Boniface considered to be incestuous.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", pp. 73–89. As is discussed below, these nobles, like Boniface and others in the eighth century, had misunderstood the language of the ''Libellus''′ incest chapter, which they believed permitted two people of any relation to marry, as long as they were not in sibling or parent-child relationships.&lt;/ref&gt; Eager to get to the bottom of this controversy, in 735 Boniface wrote to [[Nothhelm]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], requesting Nothhelm send him Canterbury's own copy of the ''Libellus''; presumably Boniface hoped that Canterbury (being the one-time residence of Augustine) possessed an authentic copy of the ''Libellus'', one that perhaps preserved more ancient readings than the copies then circulating in France and Bavaria, and would therefore serve as a corrective to the Continental copies and the incestuous nobles who relied upon them. Boniface also requested Nothhelm's opinion on the document's authenticity, for his own inquiries at the papal archives had failed to turn up an official "registered" copy of the letter there. His failed attempt to locate a "registered" papal copy of the ''Libellus'' presumably suggested to Boniface the possibility that the document was spurious and had in fact not been authored by Pope Gregory I.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", pp. 62–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boniface had specific concerns about the wording of the ''Libellus''. At least three versions of the ''Libellus'' were circulating on the Continent during Boniface's lifetime, all of these within collections of canonical and penitential documents. Boniface is known to have encountered (perhaps even helped produce) at least one canon law collection — the ''[[Collectio canonum vetus Gallica]]'' — that included the "Q/A" version of the ''Libellus'', and it is also possible that he knew of the ''Collectio Bobiensis'', with its appended "''Capitula''" version of the ''Libellus''.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; A third version of the ''Libellus'' known as the "Letter" version may also have been known to Boniface.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", p. 105–09.&lt;/ref&gt; There are slight differences in wording and chapter order between the three versions, but for the most part they are the same, with one important exception: the "Q/A" and "''Capitula''" versions contain a passage that discusses how closely a man and a woman can be related before they are prohibited from being married; the "Letter" version omits this passage. According to Karl Ubl and Michael D. Elliot, the passage in the "Q/A" and "''Capitula''" versions is authentic, and its absence from the "Letter" version represents a later modification of the text probably made in the mid-seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;Ubl, ''Inzestverbot'', pp. 219–51; Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", pp. 90–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage in the "Q/A" and "''Capitula''" versions has Gregory saying that those related within the '''second degree''' of [[kinship]] (including siblings, parents and their children, first cousins, and nephews/nieces and their aunts/uncles) are '''prohibited''' from marrying each other, but that church tradition sets no prohibition against marrying a more distant relation. However, Gregory used a method of reckoning degrees of kinship (or [[consanguinity]]) that was unfamiliar to many living in the mid-eighth century. Ubl has shown that Gregory's method of reckoning degrees of kinship was one that would come to be known as the "scriptural" or "canonical" method.&lt;ref&gt;Ubl, ''Inzestverbot'', pp. 16–18. The notion that this method is based on an ancient Teutonic system of comparing lines of descent to joints on the body (and consequently dubbed by historians the "Germanic" method), is no longer accepted by historians: Ubl, ''Inzestverbot'', pp. 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Boniface, the papacy, and apparently most of Western Europe ca. 750 followed a different method of reckoning, known as the "Roman" method, whereby a restriction within the '''second degree''' merely precluded siblings from marrying each other and parents from marrying their children, and implicitly allowed all unions beyond these.&lt;ref&gt;See Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", pp. 84–6, and Ubl, ''Inzestverbot'', pp. 14–27 and 219–51. The "Roman" system counts degrees of relatedness by adding together the number of generations that separate two individuals from their common stock; whereas the "canonical" reckons degrees of relatedness by counting the number of generations separating only one of the marriage partners from the common stock, specifically the partner who is furthest removed from that stock. Thus, for Gregory, being related "within the second degree" meant being first cousins (or any relationship closer than this); but for Boniface, being related "within the second degree" meant being brother and sister.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Boniface (misinterpreting Gregory's "canonical" method of measuring kinship for a "Roman" one) took this passage in the ''Libellus'' to mean that Gregory '''permitted''' first cousins to marry each other and nephews/nieces to marry their aunts/uncles — an opinion that Boniface (rightly) believed Gregory would not have held.&lt;ref&gt;Ubl, ''Inzestverbot'', pp. 219–51; Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", pp. 73–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boniface seems to have been unable to correct his misunderstanding of the meaning of the ''Libellus'' on this point. But this was perhaps due as much to the fact that seventh- and eighth-century canonical authorities (especially popes) so frequently conflicted on this subject, as to Boniface's own interpretative error. In a long series of letters written to subsequent bishops of Rome — [[Pope Gregory II]], [[Pope Gregory III]], [[Pope Zachary]] — Boniface periodically brought up the issue of [[consanguinity]] and marriage, and each time he received a slightly different answer as to what was permitted and what was prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", pp. 67–8 and 79–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicion about the authenticity of the ''Libellus'' seems to have ended with Boniface's death in 754, though misinterpretation of its chapter on consanguinity continued for long after that. Nevertheless, no medieval authority except Boniface is on record as ever having questioned the ''authenticity'' of the ''Libellus'' and its marriage chapter. In fact, there arose a vigorous tradition of forged documents that defended the authenticity of the ''Libellus'' and attempted to explain why it permitted, or (to those who followed the "Roman" system) ''seemed'' to permit, nieces to marry their uncles, or even first cousins to marry.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, "Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version", pp. 67–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boniface's doubts about the ''Libellus'' were revived in the twentieth century by several modern historians. In 1941 [[Suso Brechter]] made a study of the historical sources for Gregory the Great's Anglo-Saxon mission. In this study Brechter attempted to prove that the ''Libellus'' was an eighth-century forgery by Nothhelm. He believed that the ''Libellus'' contained too much that pertained specifically to eighth-century (rather than late sixth-century) theological concerns, i.e. the concerns of Nothhelm rather than Augustine. He argued that the forgery was completed in 731 and was foisted on Bede by Nothhelm in that year, making it a late insertion into Bede's ''Historia''.&lt;ref&gt;Brechter, ''Die Quellen zur Angelsachsenmission'', pp. 13–111.&lt;/ref&gt; Brechter's work did not attract much scholarly interest until 1959, when [[Margaret Deanesly]] and [[Paul Grosjean]] wrote a joint journal article refuting or modifying most of Brechter's arguments about the ''Libellus''. Deanesly and Grosjean thought that Nothhelm had collected genuine Gregorian letters, added to them material relating to theological questions current at Canterbury, and presented the finished product (or dossier) to Bede as a "Gregorian" work: what we now know as the ''Libellus responsionum''. They further argued that Nothhelm did this in two stages: a first stage that they named the ''Capitula'' version,&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with Meyvaert's ''Capitula'' version. Deanesly–Grosjean's ''Capitula'' version is in fact equivalent to Meyvaert's ''Letter'' version.&lt;/ref&gt; which they considered was best exemplified by a manuscript now in [[Copenhagen]]; and a second version, which was rearranged in the form of questions paired with answers.&lt;ref&gt;This is Meyvaert's ''Q/A'' version.&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, this second version was the work sent to Bede by Nothhelm.&lt;ref name=Meyvaert16&gt;Meyvaert, "Bede's Text", pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The upshot of Deanesly and Grosjean's research was that the ''Libellus'' was quasi-authentic: while not a genuine work of Gregory I, it was nevertheless based extensively on authentic Gregorian writings.&lt;ref&gt;Deanesly–Grosjean, "The Canterbury edition", pp. 26–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was addressed and refuted by the textual research of Paul Meyvaert,&lt;ref&gt;Meyvaert wrote a series of articles on the subject from 1959 to 1986. See: P. Meyvaert, "Les 'Responsiones' de S. Grégoire le Grand à S. Augustin de Cantorbéry", in ''Revue d’historie ecclesiastique'' 54 (1959), 879–94; Meyvaert, "Diversity within unity" (publ. 1963); Meyvaert, "Bede’s Text" (publ. 1971); and P. Meyvaert, "Le Libellus responsionum à Augustin de Cantorbéry.&lt;/ref&gt; following whose work most scholars have come to accept the ''Libellus'' as a genuine letter of Gregory.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace-Hadrill, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wright31&gt;Wright, ''Companion to Bede'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=World64&gt;Blair, ''World of Bede'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Mayr-Harting, ''The Coming of Christianity to Anglo-Saxon England'' (University Park, PA, 1991), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The only portion of the ''Libellus'' that Meyvaert could not accept as genuine was the chapter on marriage, which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed could not have been written by Gregory. Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise genuine document.&lt;ref&gt;Meyvaert, "Le Libellus responsionum à Augustin de Cantorbéry".&lt;/ref&gt; All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 has followed him on this point.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., R. Meens, "A Background to Augustine’s Mission to Anglo-Saxon England", in ''Anglo-Saxon England'' 23 (1994), pp. 5–17, at p. 7; M. de Jong, "An unsolved riddle: early medieval incest legislation", in ''Franks and Alamanni in the Merovingian period: an ethnographic perspective'', ed. I. Wood (Rochester, NY, 1998), pp. 107–40, at p. 111; B. Friesen, "Answers and Echoes: the ''Libellus responsionum'' and the Hagiography of North-Western European Mission", in ''Early Medieval Europe'' 14 (2006), pp. 153–72, at p. 155; and R. Flechner, "St Boniface as historian: a continental perspective on the organization of the early Anglo-Saxon church", in ''[[Anglo-Saxon England (journal)|Anglo-Saxon England]]'' 41 (2012), pp. 41-62, at p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored by Gregory, but he also explained exactly how it was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.

&lt;!-- EDITORS NOTE: Please do not change the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Lord proprietor]]. Thank you. --&gt;A '''lord proprietor''' is a person granted a [[royal charter]] for the establishment and government of an [[England|English]] [[colony]] in the [[17th century]]. The plural of the term is "lords proprietors" or "lords proprietary."&lt;!-- EDITORS NOTE: Please do not change the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Lord proprietor]]. Thank you. --&gt;

== Carolina ==
In 1629, [[King Charles I of England|King Charles I]] granted [[Robert Heath|Sir Robert Heath]] (the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|attorney general]]) the southern half of the English land in the New World between 36 degrees and 31 degrees north latitude from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. The land was named “[[Province of Carolina]]” or land of Charles. Sir Robert’s attempts at settlement failed and in 1645, during the [[English Civil War]], he was stripped of all of his possessions as a [[Royalist]] supporter of the King. The first permanent settlers in Carolina came from [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]]. In 1663, eight members of the English nobility received a charter from [[King Charles II of England|King Charles II]] to establish the colony of Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South Carolina |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/556096/South-Carolina |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=May 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight Lords Proprietors were:
* [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|Duke of Albemarle]] (1608–1670)
* [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]] (1609–1674)
* [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton|Baron Berkeley of Stratton]] (1602–1678)
* [[William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1608–1697)|Earl of Craven]] (1608–1697)
* [[George Carteret|Sir George Carteret]] ({{circa|1610}}–1680)
* [[William Berkeley (governor)|Sir William Berkeley]] (1605–1677)
* [[Sir John Colleton, 1st Baronet|Sir John Colleton]] (1608–1666)
* [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]] (1621–1683).

The Lords Proprietors were anxious to secure Carolina against Spanish attacks from [[St. Augustine, Florida|San Augustine]] in Florida, and to do so, they needed to attract more colonists. The Lords Proprietors offered English settlers inducements consisting of religious toleration, political representation in an assembly that had power over public taxes, exemption from [[quit-rent|quitrents]] and large grants of land. The Lords allowed settlers of any religion, except atheists.  The Lords also had a generous headright system whereby they granted one hundred and fifty acres of land to each member of a family. They postponed collection of quitrents, amounting to half a pence per acre per year, until 1689. An indentured male servant who served his term received his freedom dues from his master and a grant of one hundred acres from the Lords Proprietors. In order to attract planters with capital to invest, the Lords Proprietors also gave the owner and master the one hundred and fifty acre headright for every slave imported to the Colony. These incentives drew 6,600 colonists to the colony by 1700 compared with only 1,500 in the Spanish colony of Florida. Carolina attracted English settlers, French Protestants ([[Huguenots]]) and other colonists from [[Barbados]] and the [[West Indies]].

The first government in Carolina began in [[Albemarle County, North Carolina|Albemarle County]] in 1664 when William Sayle was appointed as the governor. Proprietary authority was weaker near the Virginia border. The Lords Proprietors established a North Carolina with its own assembly and deputy governor. In 1712, the division of Carolina into North and South was completed with the elevation of the deputy governor to governor of North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gundersen |first=Joan R. |title=Colonial Life in America |url=http://www.worldbookonline.com/student/article?id=ar124100&amp;st=lords+proprietor |work=World Book Student |accessdate=May 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lords Proprietors failed to protect the settlers when enemies attacked or threatened the Colony. For example, during [[Queen Anne's War]] (1702–1713), the colonists drove French and Spanish forces away from Charlestown. Again, between 1715 and 1718, the colonists defended themselves against attacks by the Yamasee Indians and pirates. During these times of conflict, the colonists received little or no help from the proprietors. The elite group of settlers in Carolina, former West Indians known as the Goose Creek Men, grew increasingly frustrated with the Lords Proprietors because they meddled in politics but failed to defend the colony against Spanish and Native American attacks.

In 1719, the South Carolina assembly sent a petition to England requesting that the proprietors be replaced with Crown administration. [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] appointed royal governors for North and South Carolina, converting the colony’s status to that of a [[royal colony]] (England ruled the colony but allowed the people self-government). In 1729, the Crown bought out seven of the eight of the Lords Proprietors for £22,500, approximately the amount they had spent on the colony. The eighth proprietor, [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|John Carteret, Lord Granville]], refused to sell and retained title to the lands and quitrents in the northern third of North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Alan| title=American Colonies |year=2002 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |pages=224–226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Crown purchased the proprietors' interests in 1729, their successors proved to be:
* Albemarle: in trust for [[Henry Scudamore, 3rd Duke of Beaufort|Henry Somerset, 3rd Duke of Beaufort]] and his brother, then [[Charles Noel Somerset, 4th Duke of Beaufort|Lord Charles Somerset]]
* Clarendon: [[James Bertie, 1st Earl of Abingdon#Family|James Bertie]] (1674–1735)
* Berkeley: Joseph Blake of the province of South Carolina
* Craven: William Craven, 3rd Baron Craven (1700–1739)
* Carteret: [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|John Carteret, Baron Carteret]] (1690–1763), governor of the kingdom of Ireland, who retained his interest'''*'''
* William Berkeley:  [[Henry Bertie (proprietor)|Henry Bertie]] (1675–1735) and Mary Danson, widow, of St Andrews Holborn, and Elizabeth Moor, widow, of London
* Colleton: Sir John Colleton of Exmouth, Devon
* Shaftesbury: '''†''' in trust for John Cotton of East Barnet, Middlesex
* '''†''' Some of these 1729 interests had been acquired not by inheritance but by purchase.
* '''*''' The Carteret interest continued until Independence when the Crown paid [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville#Americas|compensation for the Carteret loss]].

=== Documents ===
Two documents remain with the Lords Proprietors original seal kept intact.

In the 1690s, the Lords Proprietors were keen to implement their plan for a colonial aristocracy (an attempt to stabilize Carolina politics). One document is a grant or patent issued by the Lords Proprietors of South Carolina in 1699. It was issued to an Englishman named John Wyche, a relative of the chief Proprietor, giving him the status of [[Landgrave]] with the right to claim {{convert|48000|acre|km2}} of land in a certain region. John Wyche was appointed as the Secretary to the Province and served in this role in the colony for a short period of six months before he received another appointment in [[Hamburg]]. Some of the documents relate to Wyche’s activity in the colony. His successor to the Secretary position was John Wilmot. After a revolt against the Lords Proprietors in 1719, the colony came under royal control. This change in power was formalized by an Act of the English parliament in 1729 called “An Agreement with Seven of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, for the Surrender of their Title and Interest in that Province”.

The documents include information about Wyche’s land-claims and the petition of the Cyril family for an endorsement of their rights under the 1699 grant (a claim that the Privy Council in London disallowed). The grant was originally written in Latin and is embossed on [[vellum]] with the Great Seal of the Proprietors attached. This seal and document is one of two such 17th century documents to survive with the seal intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lords Proprietors' Grant and Seal, 1699|url=http://library.sc.edu/spcoll/hist/lords/lords.html|publisher=University of South Carolina Libraries|accessdate=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1. Sir Robert Heath’s Patent 5 Charles I, October 30, 1629'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Robert Heath's Patent 5 Charles 1st; October 30, 1629|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/heath.asp|publisher=The Avalon Project|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this patent King Charles I of England gave Sir Robert Hearth, the attorney general, property in the New World.

'''2. A Declaration and Proposals of the Lord Proprietor of Carolina, August 25- September 4, 1663'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Declaration and Proposals of the Lord Proprietor of Carolina, Aug. 25- Sept. 4, 1663|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/nc02.asp|publisher=The Avalon Project|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This charter issued by King Charles II of England proposed the formation of the Lords Proprietors and gave the lands of Carolina to the eight proprietors: the Earl of Clarendon, Duke of Albemarle, Lord Craven, Lord Berkeley, Lord Ashley, Sir George Carteret, William Berkeley and Sir John Colleton. This declaration gave the proprietors the power to protect their colony, the right to settle the colony, freedom of religion and one hundred acres of land for each man.

'''3. Charter of Carolina- March 24, 1663'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter of Carolina- March 24, 1663|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/nc01.asp|publisher=The Avalon Project|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This charter outlined how the eight proprietors should rule Carolina. It gave the land to the proprietors, allowed for patronage, gave the proprietors absolute power in the colony, gave the colony’s government the right to make laws, authorized the authority to make ordinances, gave instructions to defend the colony against enemies, outlined trade regulations, gave the proprietors building rights in the colony, allowed for an army and allowed the practice of religion conformed to the Church of England.

'''4. The Concession and Agreement of the Lords Proprietors of the Province of New Caesarea, or New Jersey, to and With All and Every the Adventures and All Such as Shall Settle or Plant There- 1664''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Concession and Agreement of the Lords Proprietors of the Province of New Caesarea, or New Jersey, to and With All and Every the Adventures and All Such as Shall Settle of Plant There- 1664|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/nc02.asp|publisher=Avalon Project|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This document outlines the distribution of power in New Jersey by the Lords Proprietors.

== New Jersey / Jersey ==
In 1664, the English gained control of New Jersey from the Dutch. King Charles II granted the country to his brother, the Duke of York, who in turn sold the colony to two of his friends, Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret (who were both already Lords Proprietors of Carolina). The area was named “New Jersey” after Carteret’s home island of Jersey in the English Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Clemens, Paul G. E. |author2=Grant Saff |lastauthoramp=yes |title=New Jersey|url=http://www.worldbookonline.com/student/article?id=ar388680&amp;st=lords+proprietor|publisher=World Book Student|accessdate=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The grant gave them the power of government in the colony. Berkeley and Carteret, however, established a constitution and gave freemen the right to elect an Assembly. A tax could not be levied without the Assembly’s approval. The Governor was appointed by the Lords Proprietors and was allowed to select his own Council, which constituted the upper branch of the Legislature. The new colony attracted many settlers because Berkeley and Sir George Carteret sold the land to the colonists at low prices and allowed them political and religious freedoms.

The Dutch re-conquered the area in 1673 but then surrendered to the English in 1674.  Berkeley sold his half of New Jersey to Edward Byllynge and John Fenwick. In 1676, Carteret and Fenwick negotiated a division of the province into two sections: East Jersey which was held by Carteret and West Jersey which was held by Fenwick. Sir George Carteret died in 1680. His property was left to Trustees who put East Jersey up for sale in a public auction. In 1682, the property was sold to [[William Penn]] and eleven associates who each sold half of their share to twelve others, forming an association of twenty-four proprietors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Oldest Land Company: How The East Jersey Board of Proprietors Was Founded|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A17FE395F15738DDDAE0994D9405B8284F0D3&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=The%20Oldest%20Land%20Company-%20How%20The%20East%20Jersey%20Board%20of%20Proprietors%20Was%20Founded&amp;st=cse|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=May 25, 2011|date=January 17, 1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This body became known as the Board of Proprietors of East Jersey. This board exercised government control, which eventually led to many conflicts within the colony. In 1702, East and West Jersey surrendered the right to government to the English Crown under [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Lords Proprietors of New Jersey|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0C1EF93B5812718DDDAF0994DD405B878BF0D3&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=The%20Lords%20Proprietors%20of%20New%20Jersey&amp;st=cse|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=May 25, 2011|date=May 16, 1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Province of New Jersey]], there were two proprietary lordships:

=== Lords Proprietary of East Jersey ===

* January 1680 – 1682 : 8 Proprietors
* 1682–1688 : 24 Proprietors (1st time)
* 1692–April 1703: 24 Proprietors (2nd time)

=== Lords Proprietary of West Jersey ===
* August 1665–18 March 1674: [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton]] (1602–1678)
* 18 March 1674–February 1675: [[Edward Byllynge]] (1st time) (died 1687) jointly with [[John Fenwick (Quaker)|John Fenwick]] (1618–1683)    
* February 1675–September 1683: Trusteeship
* September 1683 – 1687: Edward Byllynge (2nd time) (s.a.)
* February 1687 – 1688: [[Daniel Coxe]] (c. 1640–1730)
* 1692–April 1703: 12 Proprietors

However, the penalty for "minor killing with intent" is imprisonment for no less than 3 years. In practice, "killing with indignation" (killing someone who is obviously very harmful to the society) and killings committed in excessive [[defense (legal)|defense]] are considered "minor."

{{legal status}}
'''Naturalization''' (or '''naturalisation''') is the legal act or process by which a non-citizen in a country may acquire [[citizenship]] or [[nationality]] of that country. It may be done by a statute, without any effort on the part of the individual, or it may involve an application and approval by legal authorities. The rules of naturalization vary from country to country and typically include a minimum legal [[Permanent residency|residency]] requirement, and may specify other requirements such as knowledge of the national dominant language or culture, a promise to obey and uphold that country's laws. An oath or pledge of allegiance is also sometimes required. Some countries also require that the person renounce any other citizenship that they currently hold, forbidding [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]], but whether this renunciation actually causes [[loss of citizenship|loss of the person's original citizenship]], as seen by the host country and by the original country, will again depend on the laws of the countries involved.

The massive increase in population flux due to [[globalization]] and the sharp increase in the numbers of [[refugee]]s following World War I created a large number of  [[stateless person]]s, people who were not citizens of any state. In some rare cases, laws for mass naturalization were passed. As naturalization laws had been designed to cater for the relatively few people who had voluntarily moved from one country to another (expatriates), many western democracies were not ready to naturalize large numbers of people. This included the massive influx of stateless people which followed massive denationalizations and the expulsion of [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] from newly created [[nation states]] in the first part of the 20th century, but they also included the mostly [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] [[History of Russia|Russians]] who had escaped the 1917 [[October Revolution]] and the [[war communism]] period, and then the [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish refugees]]. As [[Hannah Arendt]] pointed out, [[internment camps]] became the "only nation" of such stateless people, since they were often considered "undesirable" and were stuck in an illegal situation, wherein their country had expelled them or deprived them of their nationality, while they had not been naturalized, thus living in a judicial [[no man's land]].

Since [[World War II]], the increase in [[Human migration|international migrations]] created a new category of refugees, most of them [[Foreign worker|economic refugees]]. For economic, political, humanitarian and pragmatic reasons, many states passed laws allowing a person to acquire their citizenship after birth, such as by marriage to a national – ''[[jus matrimonii]]'' – or by having ancestors who are nationals of that country, in order to reduce the scope of this category. However, in some countries this system still maintains a large part of the immigrated population in an illegal status, albeit with some massive regularizations, for example, in Spain by [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero|José Luis Zapatero]]'s government and in Italy by [[Silvio Berlusconi|Berlusconi]]'s government.

== Laws by country ==
==={{flag|China}}===
{{Main|Nationality law of the People's Republic of China}}

The [[China|People's Republic of China]] gives citizenship to persons with one or two parents with Chinese nationality who have not taken residence in other countries. The country also gives citizenship to people born on its territory to [[statelessness|stateless people]] who have settled there. Furthermore, individuals may apply for nationality if they have a near relative with Chinese nationality, if they have settled in China, or if they present another legitimate reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/immigration/chinese/law.htm Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China], GovHK.hk&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, only few people gain Chinese citizenship; as of 2010, China had only 1,448 naturalised Chinese in total.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21710264-worlds-rising-superpower-has-particular-vision-ethnicity-and-nationhood-has Who is Chinese? The upper Han], ''[[The Economist]]'', 19 November 2016 (page visited on 19 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The naturalization process starts with a written application. Applicants must submit three copies, written with a ball-point or fountain pen, to national authorities, and to provincial authorities in the Ministry of Public Security and the Public Security Bureau. Applicants must also submit original copies of a foreign passport, a residence permit, a permanent residence permit, and four two-and-a-half inch long pictures. According to the conditions outlined in the [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China]], authorities may also require "any other material that the authority believes are related to the nationality application".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enghengyang.gov.cn/showdetail.aspx?typeid=&amp;newsid=1394 "Guide and Instructions of Naturalization of Chinese Nationality"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522164847/http://www.enghengyang.gov.cn/showdetail.aspx?typeid=&amp;newsid=1394 |date=2012-05-22 }}, Hengyang, China website&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[India]]n citizenship and nationality law and the [[Constitution of India]] provides single citizenship for the entire country. The provisions relating to citizenship at the commencement of the Constitution are contained in [https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/India_2014#50 Articles 5 to 11] in Part&amp;nbsp;II of the Constitution of India. Relevant [[India]]n legislation is the Citizenship Act 1955, which has been amended by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1986, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1992, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060425230738/http://rajyasabha.nic.in/legislative/amendbills/XXXIX_2003.pdf Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003], and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110514150614/http://www.manupatra.com/downloads/2005-data/Citizenship%20Amendment%20Ordinance%202005/Citizenship%20Amendment%20Ordinance%202005.htm Citizenship (Amendment) Ordinance 2005]. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003 received the assent of the President of India on 7 January 2004 and came into force on 3 December 2004. The Citizenship (Amendment) Ordinance 2005 was promulgated by the President of India and came into force on 28 June 2005.

Following these reforms, Indian nationality law largely follows the ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (citizenship by right of blood) as opposed to the ''[[jus soli]]'' (citizenship by right of birth within the territory).

{{Main|Indonesian nationality law}}
[[Indonesia]]n nationality is regulated by Law No. 12/2006 (UU No. 12 Tahun 2006). The Indonesian nationality law is based on [[jus sanguinis]] and [[jus soli]]. The Indonesian nationality law does not recognize [[dual citizenship]] except for persons under the age of 18 (single citizenship principle). After reaching 18 years of age individuals are forced to choose one citizenship (limited double citizenship principle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Indonesia's New Immigration Law Confuses One and All|publisher= [[Jakarta Globe]]|date= |url= http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/new-immigration-law-confuses-one-and-all/472829|accessdate= 2012-06-15|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120603061637/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/new-immigration-law-confuses-one-and-all/472829|archive-date= 2012-06-03|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A foreign citizen can apply to become an Indonesian citizen with the following requirements:
* Age 18 or older, or married
* Resided in Indonesia for a minimum of 5 consecutive years or 10 non-consecutive years
* Physically and mentally healthy
* Ability to speak [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and acknowledge [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] and [[Constitution of Indonesia|Undang-Undang Dasar Negara Republik Indonesia Tahun 1945]]
* Never convicted of a crime for which the punishment is imprisonment for one year or more

Any application for citizenship is granted by the [[President of Indonesia]].

==={{flag|Israel}}===
[[Israel]]'s [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was made on 14 May 1948, the day before the British Mandate was due to expire as a result of the United Nations Partition Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0514.html "Zionists Proclaim New State of Israel; Truman Recognizes it and Hopes for Peace"], ''[[New York Times]]'', 15 May 1948&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli parliament created two laws regarding immigration, citizenship and naturalization: the [[Law of Return]] and the [[Israeli nationality law]].&lt;ref name ="Warsoff"&gt;Warsoff, Louis A. "Citizenship in the State of Israel – a Comment", ''New York University Law Review'' 33(1958): 857–862. Web. 28 Nov. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Law of Return, enacted on July 15, 1950, gives [[Jews]] living anywhere in the world the right to immigrate to Israel. This right to immigrate did not and still does not grant citizenship. In fact, for four years after Israel gained independence, there were no Israeli citizens.&lt;ref name ="Warsoff" /&gt;

On July 14, 1952, the Israeli parliament enacted the Israeli Nationality Law.&lt;ref name ="Warsoff" /&gt; The Nationality Law naturalized all citizens of Mandated Palestine, the inhabitants of Israel on July 15, 1952, and those who had legally resided in Israel between May 14, 1948, and July 14, 1952. The law further clarified that naturalization was available to immigrants who had arrived before Israel's creation, immigrants who arrived after statehood was granted, and those who did not come to Israel as immigrants but have since expressed desire to settle in Israel, with restriction. Naturalization applicants must also meet the following requirements: be over 18 years of age, have resided in Israel for three out of the five preceding years, have settled or intend to settle permanently in Israel, have some knowledge of Hebrew, and have renounced prior nationality or demonstrated ability to renounce nationality after becoming a citizen of Israel.&lt;ref name ="Warsoff" /&gt;

Because of Israel's relatively new and culturally mixed identity, Israel does not grant citizenship to persons born on Israeli soil. Instead, the government chose to enact a jus sanguinis system, with the naturalization restrictions listed above. There is currently no legislation on second-generation immigrants (those born in Israel to immigrant parents). Furthermore, foreign spouses can apply for citizenship through the Minister of the Interior, but have a variety of restrictions and are not guaranteed citizenship.&lt;ref name ="Weil"&gt;Weil, Patrick.

==={{flag|Russia}}===
Naturalization in [[Russia]] is guided by articles 13 and 14 of the federal law “About Citizenship of Russian Federation” passed on May 31, 2002. Citizenship of Russia can be obtained in general or simplified order. To become a citizen in general order, one must be 18 years of age or older, continuously live in Russia as a permanent resident for at least five years (this term is limited to one year for valued specialists, political asylum seekers and refugees), have legal means of existence, promise to obey the laws and [[Constitution of Russia]] and be fluent in the [[Russian language]].

There is also a possibility to naturalize in a simplified order, in which certain requirements will be waived. Eligible for that are persons, at least one parent of whom is a Russian citizen living on Russian territory; persons, who lived on the territories of the former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] but never obtained citizenships of those nations after they gained independence; persons, who were born on the territory of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]] and formerly held [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizenship; persons married to Russian citizens for at least 3 years; persons, who served in [[Russian Armed Forces]] under contract for at least 3 years; parents of mentally incapacitated children over 18 who are Russian citizens; participants of the State Program for Assisting Compatriots Residing Abroad; and some other categories.&lt;ref name="Russia"&gt;[http://archive.mid.ru//dks.nsf/mnsdoc/04.03.02.02 About Citizenship of Russian Federation], 31 May 2002 N 62-ФЗ&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{flag|South Africa}}===
Chapter 2 of the South African Citizenship Act, enacted on October 6, 1995, defines who is considered a naturalized citizen at the time of the act and also outlines the naturalization process for future immigrants.&lt;ref name="South"&gt;South African Citizenship Act. Pub. L. 1547. 6 Oct. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Any person who immediately prior to the commencement of the act had been a South African citizen via naturalization, had been deemed to be a South African citizen by registration, or had been a citizen via naturalization of any of the former states now composing South Africa is now considered to be a naturalized citizen of South Africa.&lt;ref name ="South" /&gt;

Those wishing to apply for naturalization in the future must apply to the Minister of Home Affairs and must meet a slew of requirements. First, naturalization applicants must be over the age of 18 and must have been a permanent resident of South Africa for one year prior to application and for four out of the eight years prior to application. Applicants must also demonstrate good character and knowledge of the basic responsibilities and privileges of a South African citizen. The ability to communicate in one of the official languages of South Africa is also required. Applicants must show the intention to reside in South Africa after naturalization, and they are required to make a declaration of allegiance.&lt;ref name ="South" /&gt;According to [https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/South_Africa_2012#30 Article 3], subsection 3 of the South African constitution, national legislation must provide for the acquisition, loss and restoration of citizenship. 

Being a naturalized South African citizen is a privilege, not a right. Even after meeting all the requirements and going through the naturalization process, the minister holds the right to deny citizenship.&lt;ref name ="Minister"&gt;"South African Citizenship Through Naturalization." Immigration Assistant. N.p., 21 July 2009. Web. 1 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign spouses of South African citizens can apply for naturalization after two years of marriage, but is subject to potential denial of the minister. The minister can also grant citizenship to minors, if their parent applies for them.&lt;ref name ="South" /&gt;

The minister also holds the power to revoke naturalization at any time for specific reasons listed in the Act. Reasons for revoking the naturalization certificate include marrying someone who is a citizen of another country and holding citizenship in another country, or applying for citizenship of another country without prior authorization for retention of citizenship.&lt;ref name ="Minister" /&gt; If a permanent resident is denied naturalization, he or she must wait at least one year before reapplying.&lt;ref name ="South" /&gt;

==={{flag|United Kingdom}}===
{{Main|British nationality law}}
There has always been a distinction in the [[law of England and Wales]] between the subjects of the monarch and aliens: the monarch's subjects owed the monarch allegiance, and included those born in his or her dominions (natural-born subjects) and those who later gave him or her their allegiance (naturalised subjects). Today, the requirements for naturalisation as a citizen of the [[United Kingdom]] depend on whether or not one is the spouse or [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partner]] of a citizen. An applicant who is a spouse or civil partner of a British citizen must:
* hold [[indefinite leave to remain]] in the [[UK]] (or an equivalent such as [[Right of Abode (United Kingdom)|Right of Abode]] or Irish citizenship)
* have lived legally in the UK for three years
* been outside of the UK no more than 90 days during the one-year period prior to filing the application.
* show sufficient knowledge of life in the UK, either by passing the [[Life in the United Kingdom test]] or by attending combined English language and citizenship classes. Proof of this must be supplied with one's application for naturalisation. Those aged 65 or over may be able to claim exemption.
* meet specified [[English language|English]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]] or [[Scottish Gaelic language]] competence standards.  Those who pass the ''Life in the UK test'' are deemed to meet English language requirements.

For those not married to or in a civil partnership with a British citizen, the requirements are:
* Five years legal residence in the UK
* Indefinite leave to remain or "equivalent" for this purpose (see above) must have been held for 12&amp;nbsp;months
* the applicant must intend to continue to live in the UK or work overseas for the UK government or a British corporation or association
* the same "good character" standards apply as for those married to British citizens
* the same language and knowledge of life in the UK standards apply as for those married to British citizens.

{{See also|History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States}}
[[File:Naturalization ceremony at Kennedy Space Center.jpg|thumb|New citizens at a naturalization ceremony at [[Kennedy Space Center]] in 2010]]

In the [[United States|United States of America]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] gives Congress the power to prescribe a uniform rule of naturalization, which is administered by state courts. There was some confusion about which courts could naturalize; the final ruling was that it could be done by any "court of record having common-law jurisdiction and a clerk ([[prothonotary]]) and seal."

The Constitution also mentions "[[Natural-born citizen|natural born citizen]]". The first naturalization Act (drafted by Thomas Jefferson) used the phrases "natural born" and "native born" interchangeably.

The Constitution does not mandate race-neutral naturalization, and the First Congress passed a naturalization act that limited eligibility for naturalization to “free white persons.” Shortly after the Civil War, Congress also extended racial eligibility for naturalization to “aliens of African nativity and persons of African descent.” Racial eligibility for naturalization was limited to these racial categories until 1940, after which eligibility for naturalization was also extended to “descendants of races indigenous to the Western Hemisphere,” “Filipino persons or persons of Filipino descent,” “Chinese persons or persons of Chinese descent,” and “persons of races indigenous to India.” The racial eligibility provisions were removed from the naturalization act in 1952, but while they remained in place many federal and state courts as well as the United States Board of Immigration Appeals interpreted the phrase “free white person” in a variety of cases involving the contested naturalization applications of immigrants from Asia and the Pacific Rim who some claimed were racially ineligible for naturalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunypress.edu/p-6435-race-nation-and-refuge.aspx Doug Coulson, ''Race, Nation, and Refuge: The Rhetoric of Race in Asian American Citizenship Cases'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 2017).]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Naturalization is also mentioned in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The Supreme Court, in the case of ''[[Minor v. Happersett]]'' explained who the citizens of the United States were before its adoption, the Court said, Before the 14th Amendment, "the Constitution of the United States did not in terms prescribe who should be citizens [of the United States] or of the several states, yet there were necessarily such citizens without such provision. Additions might always be made to the citizenship of the United States in two ways: first, by birth, and second, by naturalization". Before the U.S. Constitution was adopted, individual states set their own standards for citizenship; After adoption, all state citizens "became ipso facto a citizen" of the United States and all children born in the United States "of parents who were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens [of the United States]. These were natives or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners.". The 14th Amendment states that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof shall be citizens of the United States and of the State in which they reside". The ''Minor v. Happersett'' Court went on to say, "Some authorities go further and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction without reference to the citizenship of their parents. As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first". The Supreme Court later, in the case of ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'', interpreted this clause to imply that a naturalized citizen cannot be subsequently deprived of U.S. citizenship involuntarily.

The [[Naturalization Act of 1795]] set the initial rules on naturalization: "free, White persons" who had been resident for five years or more. The [[Naturalization Act of 1798]], part of the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], was passed by the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] and extended the residency requirement from five to fourteen years. It specifically targeted [[Irish ethnicity|Irish]] and [[France|French]] immigrants who were involved in [[Democratic-Republican Party]] politics. It was repealed in 1802.

An 1862 law allowed honorably discharged Army veterans of any war to petition for naturalization, without having filed a declaration of intent, after only one year of residence in the United States. An 1894 law extended the same privilege to honorably discharged five-year veterans of the Navy or Marine Corps. Over 192,000 aliens were naturalized between May 9, 1918, and June 30, 1919, under an act of May 9, 1918. Laws enacted in 1919, 1926, 1940, and 1952 continued preferential treatment provisions for veterans.&lt;ref&gt;Schulze, Lorine McGinnis (2003). [http://www.naturalizationrecords.com/usa/ Naturalization Records in the USA"], Retrieved April 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Passage of the Fourteenth Amendment meant that, in theory, all persons born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens regardless of race. Citizenship by birth in the United States, however, was not initially granted to [[Asians]] until 1898, when the Supreme Court, in the case of ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'' held that the Fourteenth Amendment did apply to Asians born in the United States to Alien parents who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States.

The enabling legislation for the naturalization aspects of the Fourteenth Amendment was the [[Naturalization Act of 1870]], which allowed naturalization of "aliens of [[Africa]]n nativity and to persons of African descent", but is silent about other races. The 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] banned Chinese workers and specifically barred them from naturalization. The [[Immigration Act of 1917]], (Barred Zone Act) extended those restrictions to almost all Asians.

The 1922 [[Cable Act]] specified that women marrying aliens ineligible for naturalization lose their US citizenship. At the time, all Asians were ineligible for naturalization. The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] barred entry of all those ineligible for naturalization, which again meant non-Filipino Asians.

Following the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, [[Philippines|Philippine]] residents were classified as U.S. nationals, and the 1917 [[Jones–Shafroth Act]] granted U.S. citizenship to citizens of [[Puerto Rico]]. But the 1934 [[Tydings–McDuffie Act]] (or Philippine Independence Act) reclassified Filipinos as aliens, and set a quota of 50 immigrants per year, and otherwise applying the Immigration Act of 1924 to them. The quotas did not apply to Filipinos who served in the [[United States Navy]], which actively recruited in the Philippines at that time.

Chinese persons were first permitted naturalization by the 1943 [[Magnuson Act]], which repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act. [[India]] and the Philippines were allowed 100 annual immigrants under the 1946 [[Filipino Naturalization Act]]. The [[War Brides Act]] of 1945 permitted soldiers to bring back their foreign wives and established precedent in naturalization through [[marriage]]. The 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (better known as the [[McCarran–Walter Act]]) lifted racial restrictions, but kept the quotas in place. The [[Immigration Act of 1965]] finally allowed Asians and all persons from all nations be given equal access to immigration and naturalization.

[[Illegal immigration]] became a major issue in the United States at the end of the 20th century. The [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]], while tightening border controls, also provided the opportunity of naturalization for illegal aliens who had been in the country for at least four years. Today, lawful permanent resident aliens can apply for naturalization in the  United States after five years, unless they continue to be married to a U.S. citizen, in which case they can apply after three years of permanent residency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immigrationamerica.org/citizenship/naturalization "Citizenship Through Naturalization"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824103202/http://www.immigrationamerica.org/citizenship/naturalization |date=2011-08-24 }}, ImmigrationAmerica&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Child Citizenship Act of 2000]] streamlined the naturalization process for children [[adoption in the United States|adopted]] [[international adoption|internationally]]. A child under age 18 who is adopted by at least one U.S. citizen parent, and is in the custody of the citizen parent(s), is now automatically naturalized once admitted to the United States as an immigrant or when legally adopted in the United States, depending on the visa under which the child was admitted to the United States. The Act also provides that the non-citizen minor child of a newly naturalized U.S. citizen, whether by birth or adoption, also automatically receives U.S. citizenship

A few rare mass naturalization processes have been implemented by nation states. In 1891, Brazil granted naturalization to all aliens living in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao91.htm Constituição Da República Dos EstadosUnidos Do Brasil (De 24 De Fevereiro De 1891)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804130509/http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constitui%C3%A7ao91.htm |date=2013-08-04 }}, Presidência da República – Casa Civil, art. 69&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, [[History of Greece|Greece]] massively naturalized all the Greek refugees coming back from [[History of the Republic of Turkey|Turkey]]. The second massive naturalization process was in favor of Armenian refugees coming from Turkey, who went to [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] or other former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman countries]]. Reciprocally, Turkey massively naturalized the refugees of Turkish descent or other ethnic backgrounds in Muslim creed from these countries during a redemption process.

[[Canada]] instituted a mass naturalization by [[Act of Parliament]] with the enactment of the [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946]].

After [[annexation]] of the territories east of the [[Curzon line]] by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1945, Soviets naturalized ''en masse'' all the inhabitants of those territories—including ethnic [[Poles]], as well as its other citizens who had been deported into the Soviet Union, mainly to [[Kazakhstan]]. Those persons were forcibly naturalized as Soviet citizens.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Later on, [[Germany]] granted to the ethnic [[Germans|German]] population in [[Russia]] and Kazakhstan full citizenship rights. Poland has a limited [[repatriation]] program in place.

The most recent massive naturalization case resulted from the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|Argentine economic crisis]] in the beginning of the 21st century. Existing or slightly updated [[right of return]] laws in [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] allowed many of their [[diaspora|diasporic]] descendants to obtain—in many cases to regain—naturalization in virtue of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', as in the Greek case. Hence, many Argentines acquired European nationality.

Since the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] grants citizenship only to those "born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof", and the original [[United States Constitution]] only grants Congress the power of naturalization, it could be argued that all acts of Congress that expand the right of citizenship are cases of mass naturalization.  This includes the acts that extended U.S. citizenship to citizens of [[Puerto Rico]], the [[United States Virgin Islands]], [[Guam]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], as well as the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]] which made all [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] citizens (most of them were previously excluded under the "jurisdiction" clause of the 14th Amendment).

In the eastern Malaysian state of [[Sabah]], mass naturalisation also happened during the administration of [[United Sabah National Organisation]] (USNO) and [[Sabah People's United Front]] (BERJAYA's) Muslim-dominated political parties to increase the Muslim population in the territory by naturalising immigrants and refugees from the mainly-Muslim dominated areas of [[Mindanao]] and [[Sulu Archipelago]] of the Philippines and [[Sulawesi]] of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamal Sadiq|title=Paper Citizens: How Illegal Immigrants Acquire Citizenship in Developing Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDa6LrF1yCIC&amp;pg=PA49|date=2 December 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-970780-5|pages=49–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2.sabah.gov.my/lbk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=538|title='Mustapha Bertanggungjawab Ubah Demografi Sabah'|author=Nigel|language=Malay|work=Sabah State Government|publisher=Kudat Town Board|date=16 August 2013|accessdate=1 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601030334/http://ww2.sabah.gov.my/lbk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=538 |archivedate=1 June 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.usm.my/km/33(2)2015/km33022015_01.pdf |title=Patronage, Power and Prowess: Barisan Nasional's Equilibrium Dominance in East Malaysia |author=Faisal H.

=== In occupied territories ===
The mass naturalization of native persons in occupied territories is illegal under the laws of war (Hague and Geneva Conventions).  However, there have been many instances of such illegal mass naturalizations in the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

== Denaturalization ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Citizenship]] and [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]] --&gt;
{{main|Loss of citizenship}}
'''Denaturalization''' is the reverse of naturalization, when a state deprives one of its citizens of his or her [[citizenship]]. From the point of view of the individual, denaturalization means [[revocation]] or [[loss of citizenship]]. Denaturalization can be based on various legal justifications. The most severe form is the "stripping of citizenship" when denaturalization takes place as a penalty for actions considered criminal by the state, often only indirectly related to nationality, for instance for having served in a foreign military. In countries that enforce [[multiple citizenship|single citizenship]], voluntary naturalization in another country will lead to an automatic loss of the original citizenship; the language of the law often refers to such cases as "giving up one's citizenship" or (implicit) [[renunciation of citizenship]]. In another case, affecting only foreign-born citizens, denaturalization can refer to the loss of citizenship by an [[annulment]] of naturalization, also known as "administrative denaturalization" where the original act of naturalization is found to be invalid, for instance due to an [[Administrative Error|administrative error]] or if it had been based on [[fraud]] (including [[bribery]]). In the US, the [[Bancroft Treaties]] in the 19th century regulated legislation concerning denaturalization.

In 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Mark Rockwell|url=https://fcw.com/articles/2018/01/12/janus-dhs-biometrics.aspx|title=DHS pursues cases exploiting biometric data gaps|website=fcw.com|date=2018-01-12|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. government launched a program (''Operation Janus'') “to prevent aliens who received a final removal order under a different identity from obtaining immigration benefits”.&lt;ref name="snopes-2018-07-12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/denaturalization-task-force/|title=Has the Trump Administration Launched an Immigrant ‘Denaturalization’ Task Force|website=snopes.com|date=2018-07-12|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, for the first time, a denaturalization was performed as a result of this program,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Jeff Mordock|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jan/9/first-denaturalization-occurs-under-dojs-operation/|title=For first time, Justice Dept. yanks naturalized citizenship in new 'Operation Janus' crackdown|publisher=Washington Times|date=2018-01-09|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a further program (''Operation Second Look'') was initiated by the [[Homeland Security Investigations|HSI]] specifically to address leads received from Operation Janus. In June 2018, UCSIS announced an increase of the efforts to detect fraudulent naturalization cases, aiming at the revocation of the citizenship of individuals who had applied under false pretense.&lt;ref name="snopes-2018-07-12"/&gt;

=== After World War II ===
==== In the United States ====
{{see also|List of denaturalized former citizens of the United States}}
Loss of U.S. citizenship was a consequence of foreign military service based on Section 349(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act until its provisions were found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_780.html "Advice about Possible Loss of U.S. Citizenship and Foreign Military Service"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202070748/http://www.travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_780.html |date=2011-02-02 }}, Travel.State.Gov&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15032.html|title=The Sovereign Citizen {{!}} Patrick Weil|website=www.upenn.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yaser Esam Hamdi]] was a U.S. citizen captured in Afghanistan in 2001. He was fighting against U.S. and [[Afghan Northern Alliance]] forces, siding with the [[Taliban]]. He was named by the Bush administration as an [[illegal enemy combatant]], and militarily detained in the country for almost three years without receiving any charges. On September 23, 2004, the [[U.S. Justice Department]] agreed to release Hamdi to Saudi Arabia on the condition that he give up his U.S. citizenship, though since it was done under duress it is possible that he can later reclaim it.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;!-- it "may" be possible? --&gt;

==== In the United Kingdom ====
Section 4 of the British [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5fFEHFs8o?url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2002/ukpga_20020041_en_2 Part 1 Nationality], Office of Public Sector Information, at Web Cite.org&lt;/ref&gt; gave power to the [[Home Secretary]] to ‘deprive a person of a citizenship status if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the person has done anything seriously prejudicial to the vital interests’ of the United Kingdom etc., except in the case where such might render the person [[statelessness|stateless]].&lt;ref&gt;For a comparative analysis of modes of loss of citizenship of 30 European states, see De Groot, G.R. and M. Vink (2010). [http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/Loss.pdf  "Loss of Citizenship: Trends and Regulations in Europe"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302113736/http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/Loss.pdf |date=2012-03-02 }}. Comparative Report RSCAS/EUDO-CIT-Comp. 2010/4. Florence: EUDO Citizenship Observatory, pp. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In Canada ====
Under Canadian citizenship law citizenship can be revoked by an order from the federal cabinet if:

* Naturalized Canadians is convicted of fraud in relation to their citizenship application or original admission to Canada as an immigrant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-revoking-citizenship-of-more-than-3000-after-fraud-investigation/article4532222/ |title=Ottawa revoking citizenship of more than 3,000 after fraud investigation |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past (pre-1977) revoking citizenship was more broad:

* Naturalization in another country
* Long residence overseas (before 1967)
* Lost based on parent's loss of Canadian citizenship

Those who are revoked can appeal to the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court of Canada]].

==== In South Africa ====
[[File:Bantustans in South Africa.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Map of the [[bantustan|black homelands]] in [[South Africa]] at the end of [[Apartheid]] in 1994]]
{{main|Bantustan}}
In [[Apartheid]]-era South Africa, the [[Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act, 1970]], removed South African citizenship from [[Black South Africans]], making them citizens of nominally-independent or self-governing tribal "homelands", the [[Bantustan]]s — none of which achieved international recognition. In parallel with the creation of the homelands, South Africa's black population was subjected to a massive programme of forced relocation. It has been estimated that 3.5 million people were forced from their homes from the 1960s through the 1980s, many being resettled in the Bantustans.&lt;!-- unsourced in [[Bantustan]] --&gt;

With the demise of the apartheid regime in South Africa in 1994, the Bantustans were dismantled and their territory reincorporated into the Republic of South Africa. The drive to achieve this was spearheaded by the [[African National Congress]] as a central element of its programme of reform. The Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act itself was repealed by the [[South African Constitution of 1993|1993 Interim Constitution]], with all citizens being restored to their South African citizenship.

=== Between World Wars ===
Before [[World War I]], only a small number of countries had laws governing denaturalization that could be enforced against citizens guilty of "lacking [[patriotism]]". Such denaturalized citizens became [[stateless person]]s. During and after the war, most European countries passed amendments to revoke naturalization.&lt;ref name="Arendt"&gt;[[John Hope Simpson]], ''The Refugee Problem'', [[Institute of International Affairs]], October 1939, quoted by [[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951), section 2 on [[Imperialism]], last chapter&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Homo Sacer|Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power or Bare Life]]'' (1998), philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] mentioned a number of denaturalization laws that were passed after World War I by most European countries:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is important to note that starting with the period of World War&amp;nbsp;I, many European states began to introduce laws which permitted their own citizens to be denaturalized and denationalized. The first was France, in 1915, with regard to naturalized citizens of "enemy" origins; in 1922 the example was followed by Belgium, which revoked the naturalization of citizens who had committed "anti-national" acts during the war; in 1926 the Fascist regime in Italy passed a similar law concerning citizens who had shown themselves to be "unworthy of Italian citizenship"; in 1933 it was Austria's turn, and so forth, until in 1935 the [[Nuremberg Laws]] divided German citizens into full citizens and citizens without political rights. These laws—and the mass statelessness that ensued—mark a decisive turning point in the life of the modern nation-state and its definitive emancipation from the naive notions of "people" and "citizen"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1915 French denaturalization law applied only to naturalized citizens with "enemy origins" who had kept their original nationality. Later under [[Raymond Poincaré]]'s government, another law was passed in 1927 which entitled the government to denaturalize any new citizen who committed acts contrary to the [[national interest]].

In 1916, Portugal passed a law which automatically denaturalized all citizens born to a German father.

In 1922, Belgium enacted a law revoking the naturalization of persons accused of having committed "antinational acts" during the war; this was supplemented in 1934 by a new decree against people "in dereliction of their duties as Belgian citizens."

After 1926 in Italy, people who were deemed not to deserve the Italian citizenship or who were considered to represent a threat to the [[public order]] could lose their naturalization.

Egypt in 1926 and Turkey in 1928 enacted laws authorizing denaturalization of any person threatening the public order. Austria passed a similar law in 1933 by which it could denaturalize any citizen who participated in a hostile action against the state. Russia also passed several similar decrees after 1921.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt;

In 1933, [[Nazi Germany]] passed a law authorizing it to denaturalize any person "living abroad" and began restricting the citizenship rights of naturalized citizens of Jewish origin, followed in 1935 by citizens by birth on the basis of the [[Nuremberg laws]].

During [[Vichy France]], 15,000 persons, mostly Jews, were denaturalized (between June 1940 and August 1944), following the setting up, in July 1940, of a Commission charged of revision of naturalizations since the 1927 reform of the nationality law.&lt;ref&gt;François Masure, "''Etat et identité nationale. Un rapport ambigu à propos des naturalisés'', in ''Journal des anthropologues'', hors-série 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;39–49 (see p.&amp;nbsp;48) (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Before World War I ===
In the United States, the proposed, but never ratified, [[Titles of Nobility amendment]] of 1810 would revoke the American citizenship of anyone who would "accept, claim, receive or retain, any title of nobility" or who would receive any gifts or honors from a foreign power.

'''Nellie May Madison''' (née Mooney) (April 5, 1895&amp;ndash;July 8, 1953)&lt;ref name="ANBIO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cairns|first1=Kathleen A.|title=Madison, Nellie May|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01909.html|website=American National Biography Online|publisher=American Council of Learned Societies|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American woman who was convicted of murder in 1934 for killing her husband. She was the first woman to be [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] in the state of [[California]]. Due to public outcry, her sentence was later commuted to life in prison and she was eventually released.

Her case helped garner legitimacy for the [[abuse defense]], a concept virtually unknown at the time in criminal cases.&lt;ref name=TEW&gt;{{cite book  | last =Cairns  | first =Kathleen A. | title =The enigma woman: the death sentence of Nellie May Madison | publisher =[[University of Nebraska Press]]  | year =2007  | location = | pages = | isbn =0-8032-1141-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was the subject of a 2015 episode of [[Investigation Discovery]]'s series ''[[A Crime to Remember]]''.

==Early life==
She was born in [[Red Rock, Montana]] and raised in the nearby community of [[Dillon, Montana|Dillon]].&lt;ref name= "ANBIO" /&gt; She was trained to be a natural survivalist of the mountains. Prior to her marriage to Eric Madison, she had an annulment from a 23-year-old ex-convict when she was 13. She also later married and divorced three different men. She had no children.&lt;ref name="actr"&gt;''[[A Crime to Remember]]'', Season 3 Episode 7, "Damsel on Death Row", December 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder and conviction==
On March 24, 1934 at their home in [[Burbank, California]], after alleged repeated [[spousal abuse]] episodes by her husband Eric Madison, Nellie Madison pointed a gun at Eric while he was changing out of his day clothes with the intent on threatening him. He quickly reached under the bed for a box of butcher knives and allegedly threatened to cut her heart out. As he was reaching for a knife, Nellie shot Eric in the back five times, killing him.

Nellie Madison was later arrested and tried for the murder of her husband. Even before he knew all the facts, Los Angeles County District Attorney [[Buron Fitts]] sought the death penalty for Madison. On advice of her lawyers, Madison made no mention of the spousal abuse and claimed she was not at the scene of the murder. As her story was implausible, a jury convicted her and Judge Charles Fricke sentenced her to death. On appeal, the [[California Supreme Court]] upheld the conviction.

==Appeal==
After sentencing, Madison's ex-husband, whom she was still friends with, urged her to make the spousal abuse episodes public.

When pleading her case to Fricke, he refused to reduce the sentence and dismissed the allegations of domestic violence as "ridiculous."

But soon Madison began receiving public support, including from prominent journalist [[Agness Underwood|"Aggie" Underwood]].  Underwood discovered that Eric Madison had beaten both Nellie and his ex-wife into signing a similar confession stating they were unfaithful in their marriage, when in fact, it was Eric who had been unfaithful and having affairs with teenage girls.&lt;ref name ="actr" /&gt;

All of the jurors who convicted Madison petitioned Governor [[Frank Merriam]] to [[Commutation of sentence|commute]] the sentence. In September 1935, Merriam commuted Madison's sentence to life in prison. After she waged a letter-writing campaign from prison to reduce her sentence, Governor [[Culbert Olson]] had Madison freed from prison on March 27, 1943, exactly nine years and three days after the murder.

==Later life==
In the fall of 1943, she settled in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], where she married her sixth husband, house painter John Wagner.  It was her longest marriage. She died there on July 8, 1953 after a stroke.&lt;ref name="ANBIO" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5115">'''Non-repudiation''' refers to a situation where a statement's author cannot successfully dispute its authorship or the validity of an associated [[contract]]. The term is often seen in a legal setting when the authenticity of a signature is being challenged. In such an instance, the authenticity is being "repudiated".{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==In security==
In general, ''non-repudiation'' involves associating actions or changes with a unique individual. For example, a secure area may use a [[Keycard lock|key card access]] system. Here, non-repudiation would be violated if key cards were shared or if lost and stolen cards were not immediately reported. Similarly, the owner of a computer account must not allow others to use it, such as by giving away their password, and a policy should be implemented to enforce this. This prevents the owner of the account from denying actions performed by the account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Negus |first=Christopher |others=Contributions by Christine Bresnahan |title=Linux Bible |date=2012 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781118286906 |page=580 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0gL9poGWIIC&amp;lpg=PA580&amp;dq=linux%20bible%20Non-repudiation&amp;pg=PA580#v=onepage&amp;q=Non-repudiation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In digital security===
In [[information security|digital security]], non-repudiation means:&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/778/687 Non-Repudiation in the Digital Environment (Adrian McCullagh)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*A service that provides proof of the [[Data integrity|integrity]] and [[Message authentication|origin of data]].
*An authentication that can be said to be genuine with high confidence.

Proof of data integrity is typically the easiest of these requirements to accomplish. A data [[Hash function|hash]] such as [[SHA2]] usually ensures that the data will not be changed undetectably. Even with this safeguard, it is possible to tamper with [[data in transit]], either through a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] or [[phishing]]. Because of this, data integrity is best asserted when the recipient already possesses the necessary verification information.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The most common method of verifying the digital origin of data is through [[digital certificates]], a form of [[public key infrastructure]] that includes [[digital signatures]]. Note that the public key scheme is not used for [[encryption]] in this form; the goal is not to achieve confidentiality since a message signed with a private key can be read by anyone using the public key. Verifying the digital origin means that the certified/signed data likely came from someone who possesses the private key corresponding to the signing certificate. If the key is not properly safeguarded by the original owner, digital forgery can occur.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Trusted third parties (TTPs)==
To mitigate the risk of people repudiating their own signatures, the standard approach is to involve a [[trusted third party]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The two most common TTPs are [[forensic analyst]]s and [[notary|notaries]]. A forensic analyst specializing in handwriting can compare some signature to a known valid signature and assess its legitimacy. A notary is a witness who verifies an individual's identity by checking other credentials and affixing their certification that the person signing is who they claim to be. A notary provides the extra benefit of maintaining independent logs of their transactions, complete with the types of credentials checked, and another signature that can be verified by the forensic analyst. This double security makes notaries the preferred form of verification.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

For digital information, the only TTP is the repository for [[public key certificate]]s. This lets the recipient verify the origin of an item even if the public information has ever been directly exchanged. The digital signature, however, is forensically identical in both legitimate and forged uses - if someone possesses the private key they can create a "real" signature. Protecting the private key is the idea behind the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s [[Common Access Card]] (CAC), which never lets the key leave the card. This means that, to use the card for encryption and digital signatures, a person needs the [[personal identification number]] (PIN) code necessary to unlock it.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9140">'''Possession is nine-tenths of the law''' is an [[idiom|expression]] meaning that ownership is easier to maintain if one has possession of something, or difficult to enforce if one does not. The expression is also stated as "possession is nine points of the law", which is credited as derived from the Scottish expression "possession is eleven points in the law, and they say there are but twelve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Albert M. Martin |year=1882 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDnnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA355&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hLm5QcF-yH&amp;sig=kOK8OdT0Uh5PxMxpCXXWqynOHy0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=He3-T9TIK4fO2AW4hJW0BA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Answers |journal=The Chautauquan |volume=3 |issue=October 1882 |pages= |publisher=Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the principle is an oversimplification, it can be restated as: "In a property dispute (whether real or personal), in the absence of clear and compelling testimony or documentation to the contrary, the person in actual, custodial possession of the property is presumed to be the rightful owner. The rightful owner shall have their possession returned to them; if taken or used. The shirt or blouse you are currently wearing is presumed to be yours, unless someone can prove that it is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.parlidebate.org/pdf/vol6no3.pdf|title=Government's defense of the Status Quo: Advocating a shift in applying presumption theory in intercollegiate parliamentary debate|author=S Rutledge|publisher=Parliamentary Debate|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The adage is not literally true, that by law the person in possession is presumed to have a nine times stronger claim than anyone else, but that "it places in a strong light the legal truth that every claimant must succeed by the strength of his own title, and not by the weakness of his antagonist's."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=3|publisher=Pace Y.B.

Under Roman law, it was an [[wikt:interdictum|interdictum]] ordering the parties to maintain possession of property until it was determined who owned the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/mcglr38&amp;section=52|volume=38|publisher=McGeorge L.

==In anarcho-capitalist theory==
[[Walter Block]] has stated, "Suppose that 100 slaves worked on the plantation, but only one heir of any of them, B, can now be found. Does B get the entire value of the landed estate (apart from the house), or only one percent of it. The answer is the latter. For possession is 9/10ths of the law. He who is the present land holder (W in our case) is always deemed to be the proper owner, unless evidence to the contrary can be adduced. But the claim of B, stemming from the work of his grandfather, B, can at most encompass what he, B, that is, contributed to the enhancement of the value of the property. The other ninety-nine percent of the value of this land will remain with W, until and unless other grandchildren of slaves come forth with proof of parentage."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Radical libertarianism: applying libertarian principles to dealing with the unjust government|author=Block, Walter|url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/28/rp_28_7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray Rothbard]] noted that [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] "conclude that even though the property was originally stolen, that if  the victim or his heirs cannot be found, and if the current possessor was not the actual criminal who stole the property, then title to that property belongs properly, justly, and ethically to its current possessor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethics of Liberty|url=http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/nine.asp|chapter=Property and Criminality|author=Rothbard, Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prior consistent statements''' and '''prior inconsistent statements''', in the law of [[evidence]], occur where a [[witness]], [[testifying]] at [[trial (law)|trial]], makes a statement that is either consistent or inconsistent, respectively, with a previous statement given at an earlier time such as during a [[discovery (law)|discovery]], [[interview]], or [[interrogation]]. The  examiner can [[witness impeachment|impeach]] the witness when an inconsistent statement is found, and may conversely bolster the credibility of an impeached witness with a prior consistent statement.

==Impeachment with a prior inconsistent statement==
Before the witness can be impeached the examiner must have extrinsic evidence of the prior statement. The examiner must also provide the witness with the opportunity to adopt or reject the previous statement. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lectlaw.com/files/crf13.htm Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 613]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the majority of U.S. jurisdictions, prior inconsistent statements may not be introduced to prove the truth of the prior statement itself, as this constitutes [[Hearsay in the United States|hearsay]], but only to impeach the credibility of the witness. 

However, under Federal Rule of Evidence 801 and the minority of U.S. jurisdictions that have adopted this rule, a prior inconsistent statement may be introduced as evidence of the truth of the statement itself if the prior statement was given in live testimony and under oath as part of a formal hearing, proceeding, trial, or deposition.&lt;ref&gt;In some U.S. jurisdictions, a prior inconsistent statement that is signed or adopted by a witness is admissible both for impeachment and substantive purposes. ''See'', ''e.g.'', [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Brady|''Commonwealth v. Brady'']], 507 A.2d 66 (Pa. 1986). 

This approach has been rejected in the federal system.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Note''' that under [[California Evidence Code]] ("CEC") §§769, 770, and 1235, prior inconsistent statements may be used for both impeachment and as substantive evidence, even if they were not originally made under oath at a formal proceeding, as long as "the witness was so examined while testifying as to give him an opportunity to explain or to deny the statement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=47361519371+0+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve California Evidence Code §770]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bolstering with a prior consistent statement==
===Prior consistent statements===

A prior consistent statement is not a hearsay exception, the FRE specifically define it as non hearsay. A prior consistent statement is  admissible:
# to rebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated a statement, for instance, during her testimony at trial; 
# the witness testifies at the present trial; and 
# the witness is subject to cross-examination about the prior statement &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_801 Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 801 (d)(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no requirement that the prior consistent statement have been made under oath at a prior trial or hearing.

A form of prior consistent statement excepted from this rule is that of prior identification by the witness of another person in a lineup.

The '''Rowell–Sirois Commission''' officially known as the '''Royal Commission on Dominion–Provincial Relations''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Royal Commission]] looking into the Canadian economy and federal–provincial relations. It was called in 1937 and reported in 1940.

The Commission was chaired first by [[Newton Wesley Rowell]] and then by [[Joseph Sirois]]. [[James McGregor Stewart]] acted as chief counsel. It was called as a result of the [[Great Depression]]. The attempts to manage the Depression by the government illustrated grave flaws with the [[Canadian constitution]]. While the federal government had most of the revenue gathering powers, the provinces had unexpectedly greater expenditure responsibilities. The founders had given the provinces responsibility for [[health care]], [[education]], and [[social welfare|welfare]] when these were only minor concerns; by 1937, however, these had all become massive expenditure areas.

The Commission recommended that the federal government take over control of [[unemployment insurance]] and [[pension]]s. It also recommended the creation of [[equalization payments]] and large transfers of money from the federal government to the province each year. Other recommendations were not adopted due to resistance from the provinces or the federal government.

[[File:Leibowitz, Samuel &amp; Scottsboro Boys 1932.jpg|thumb|The Scottsboro Boys, with attorney [[Samuel Leibowitz]], under guard by the state militia, 1932]]

The '''Scottsboro Boys''' were nine [[African American]] teenagers, ages 13 to 20, falsely accused in [[Alabama]] of [[rape|raping]] two [[White American]] women on a train in 1931.  The landmark set of legal cases from this incident dealt with [[Racism in the United States|racism]] and the [[right to a fair trial]]. The cases included a [[Lynching in the United States|lynch mob]] before the suspects had been indicted, [[all-white jury|all-white juries]], rushed trials, and disruptive mobs. It is commonly cited as an example of a [[miscarriage of justice]] in the [[United States legal system]].

On March 25, 1931, two dozen people were '[[hobo]]ing' on a [[freight train]] traveling between [[Chattanooga]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the hoboes being an equal mix of African-Americans and Caucasians. A group of white teenage boys saw 18-year-old Haywood Patterson on the train and attempted to push him off the train, claiming that it was "a white man's train".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/scottsboro/filmmore/pt.html|title=Scottsboro: An American Tragedy Transcript|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=PBS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128221113/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/scottsboro/filmmore/pt.html|archive-date=January 28, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of whites gathered rocks and attempted to force all of the black men from the train. Patterson and the other black passengers were able to ward off the group. The humiliated white teenagers jumped or were forced off the train and reported to the city's [[sheriff]] that they had been attacked by a group of black teenagers. The sheriff deputized a ''[[posse comitatus]]'', stopped and searched the train at [[Paint Rock, Alabama]] and arrested the black Americans. Two young white women also got off the train and accused the black teenagers of rape. The case was first heard in [[Scottsboro, Alabama]], in three rushed trials, in which the [[defendant]]s received poor [[legal representation]]. All but 12-year-old Roy Wright were convicted of rape and [[sentenced to death]], the common sentence in Alabama at the time for black men convicted of raping white women,&lt;ref name=UMKC-SB_acct /&gt; even though there was medical evidence to suggest that they had not committed the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powers|first1=Rachael|last2=Poynton|first2=Holly|publisher=Coordination Group Publications Ltd|title=To Kill A Mockingbird, The Text Guide|isbn=978 1 84762 023 1|quote="Even though there was medical evidence that indicated the women hadn't been raped, the all-white jury sentenced all the men except the youngest to death."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With help from the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) and the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), the case was appealed. The [[Alabama Supreme Court]] affirmed seven of the eight convictions, and granted 13-year-old Eugene Williams a new trial because he was a [[minor (law)|minor]]. Chief Justice [[John C. Anderson (judge) |John C. Anderson]] dissented, ruling that the defendants had been denied an [[impartial jury]], fair trial, fair sentencing, and [[ineffective assistance of counsel|effective counsel]]. While waiting for their trials, eight of the nine defendants were held in [[Kilby Prison]]. The cases were twice appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]], which led to landmark decisions on the conduct of trials. In ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'' (1932), it ordered new trials.&lt;ref name="Powell v. Alabama 1932"&gt;''Powell v. Alabama'', 1932, 287 U.S. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was first returned to the [[lower court]] and the judge allowed a [[change of venue]], moving the retrials to [[Decatur, Alabama]]. [[James Edwin Horton|Judge Horton]] was appointed. During the retrials, one of the alleged victims admitted to [[false accusation of rape|fabricating the rape story]] and asserted that none of the Scottsboro Boys touched either of the white women. The [[jury]] found the defendants guilty, but the judge set aside the verdict and granted a new trial.

The judge was replaced and the case tried under a judge who ruled frequently against the defense. For the third time a jury—now with one African-American member—returned a guilty verdict. The case was sent to the US Supreme Court on appeal. It ruled that African-Americans had to be included on juries, and ordered retrials.&lt;ref name="Norris v. Alabama 1935"&gt;''Norris v. Alabama'' (1935), 294 U.S. 587, 595–596.&lt;/ref&gt; Charges were finally dropped for four of the nine defendants. Sentences for the rest ranged from 75 years to death. All but two served prison sentences; all were released or escaped by 1946. One was shot while being escorted to prison by a Sheriff's Deputy and permanently disabled. Two escaped, were later charged with other crimes, convicted, and sent back to prison. [[Clarence Norris]], the oldest defendant and the only one sentenced to death in the final trial, "jumped parole" in 1946 and went into hiding. He was found in 1976 and [[pardon]]ed by Governor [[George Wallace]], by which time the case had been thoroughly analyzed and shown to be an injustice. Norris later wrote a book about his experiences. The last surviving defendant died in 1989.

"The Scottsboro Boys", as they became known, were defended by many in the [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and attacked by many in the [[Deep South|South]]. The case is now widely considered a miscarriage of justice, highlighted by use of [[all-white jury|all-white juries]]. Black Americans in Alabama had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] since the late 19th century and were likewise not allowed on juries. The case has been explored in many works of literature, music, theatre, film and television.  On November 21, 2013, Alabama's [[parole board]] voted to grant posthumous pardons to the three Scottsboro Boys who had not been pardoned or had their convictions overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://governor.alabama.gov/newsroom/2013/11/governor-bentleys-statement-pardoning-scottsboro-boys/|title=Governor Bentley's Statement on the Pardoning of the Scottsboro Boys|last=Bentley|first=Robert J.|date=November 21, 2013|work=|publisher=Office of Alabama Governor|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117175539/http://governor.alabama.gov/newsroom/2013/11/governor-bentleys-statement-pardoning-scottsboro-boys/|archive-date=January 17, 2017|dead-url=no|via=|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 1931, the [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]] line between Chattanooga and Memphis, Tennessee, had nine black youths who were [[hobo]]ing on a freight train with several white males and two white women.&lt;ref name=LinderBios&gt;{{cite web|first=Douglas O.|last=Linder |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTRIALS/scottsboro/SB_bSBs.html |title=Biographies of the Scottsboro Boys|publisher=[[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] School of Law|year=1999|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=287US45_49&gt;{{cite court|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/287/45/case.html#49|litigants=Powell v. Alabama|vol=287|reporter=U.S.|opinion=45|pinpoint=49|year=1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAretha2008|Aretha (2008)]], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; A fight broke out between the white and black groups near the [[Lookout Mountain]] tunnel, and the whites were kicked off the train. The whites went to a sheriff in the nearby town [[Paint Rock, Alabama]], and claimed that they were assaulted by the blacks on the train. The sheriff gathered a posse and gave orders to search for and "capture every Negro on the train."&lt;ref name=Linder550&gt;Douglas O. Linder, "Without Fear or Favor: Judge James Edwin Horton and the Trial of the 'Scottsville Boys{{'"}}, Vol. 68 ''UMKC Law Review'' 549, 550.&lt;/ref&gt; The posse arrested all black passengers on the train for assault.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The unfortunate black teenagers were: '''[[Haywood Patterson]] (age 18)''' who claimed that he had ridden freight trains for so long that he could light a cigarette on the top of a moving train; '''[[Clarence Norris]] (age 19)''', who had left behind ten brothers and sisters in rural Georgia; '''[[Charlie Weems]] (age 19)'''; brothers '''Andy Wright (age 19)''' and '''Roy Wright (age 12)''', who were leaving home for the first time. The nearly blind '''[[Olin Montgomery]] (age 17)''', who was hoping to get a job in order to pay for a pair of glasses that he so desperately needed; '''[[Ozie Powell]] (age 16)'''; '''[[Willie Roberson]] (age 16)''', who suffered from such severe syphilis that he could barely walk; and '''[[Eugene Williams]] (age 13)''';&lt;ref name=LinderBios /&gt; Of these nine boys, only four knew each other prior to their arrest.

Two white women who were also aboard the train, Victoria Price and Ruby Bates, told a member of the posse that they had been raped by a group of black teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;Linder, p. 550.&lt;/ref&gt; The posse brought the women to the jail where the accused were being held, and they identified them as their attackers. A doctor was summoned to examine Price and Bates for signs of rape, but none was found. A widely published photo showed the two women shortly after the arrests in 1931.{{citation needed|date = June 2016}}

There was no evidence (beyond the women's testimony) pointing to the guilt of the accused, yet that was irrelevant due to the prevalent racism in the South at the time, according to which black men were constantly being policed by white men for signs of sexual interest in white women, which could be punishable by lynching. Price and Bates may have told the police that they were raped to divert police attention from themselves. They were both suspected of being prostitutes and not only risked being arrested for it, but they could also have been prosecuted for violating the [[Mann Act]] by crossing a state line "for immoral purposes."

== Lynch mob ==
In the [[Jim Crow]] South, [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] of black males accused of raping or murdering whites was common; word quickly spread of the arrest and rape story. Soon a [[Lynching|lynch mob]] gathered at the jail in Scottsboro, demanding the youths be surrendered to them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAretha2008|Aretha (2008)]], pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scottsboro Mob 1931.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The crowd at Scottsboro on April 6, 1931]]

Sheriff Matt Wann stood in front of the jail and addressed the mob, saying he would kill the first person to come through the door.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Scottsboro: An American Tragedy"], PBS.org, ''American Experience''.&lt;/ref&gt; He removed his belt and handed his gun to one of his deputies. He walked through the mob and the crowd parted to let him through; Wann was not touched by anyone. He walked across the street to the courthouse where he telephoned Governor [[Benjamin M. Miller]], who mobilized the [[Alabama Army National Guard]] to protect the jail.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodman6&gt;James Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He took the defendants to the county seat of [[Gadsden, Alabama]], for indictment and to await trial. Although rape was potentially a [[capital offense]] in Alabama, the defendants at this point were not allowed to consult an attorney.{{citation needed|date = June 2016}}

== The trials ==
The prisoners were brought to court by 118 Alabama guardsmen, armed with machine guns. It was market day in Scottsboro, and farmers were in town to sell produce and buy supplies. A crowd of thousands soon formed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAretha2008|Aretha (2008)]], p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Courthouse access required a permit due to the salacious nature of the testimony expected.&lt;ref name=Acker18&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Supreme Court later described this situation, "the proceedings ... took place in an atmosphere of tense, hostile, and excited public sentiment."&lt;ref&gt;''Powell v. Alabama'', p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; For each trial, all-white juries were selected. There were few African Americans in the jury pool, as most had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] since the turn of the century by a new state constitution and white discriminatory practice, and were thus disqualified from jury service.{{citation needed|date = June 2016}}

===Defense attorneys===
The pace of the trials were very fast before the standing-room-only, all-white audience. The judge and prosecutor wanted to speed the nine trials to avoid violence, so the first trial took a day and a half, and the rest took place one right after the other, in just one day. The judge had ordered the Alabama bar to assist the defendants, but the only attorney who volunteered was Milo Moody, a 69-year-old attorney who had not defended a case in decades.&lt;ref name=Acker18/&gt; The judge persuaded Stephen Roddy, a [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], real estate lawyer, to assist him. Roddy admitted he had not had time to prepare and was not familiar with Alabama law, but agreed to aid Moody.&lt;ref&gt;James Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Against accepted practice, Roddy presented both the testimony of his clients and the case of the girls. Because of the mob atmosphere, Roddy petitioned the court for a [[change of venue]], entering into evidence newspaper and law enforcement accounts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doug Linder |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTrials/scottsboro/SB_HRrep.html |title=American Civil Liberties Union report of change of venue testimony |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the crowd as "impelled by curiosity".&lt;ref name=Acker20&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Patterson v. State'', 1932, 141 So. 195, 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Hawkins found that the crowd was curious and not hostile.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norris and Weems trial===
Clarence Norris and Charlie Weems were tried first. During prosecution testimony, Victoria Price stated that she and Ruby Bates witnessed the fight, that one of the black men had a gun, and that they all raped her at knife point. During cross-examination by Roddy, Price livened her testimony with wisecracks that brought roars of laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Report on the Scottsboro, Alabama Case|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scottsboro/SB_HRrep.html|date=May 27, 1931|first=Hollace|last=Ransdall|accessdate=January 26, 2011|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201014404/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scottsboro/SB_HRrep.html|archivedate=February 1, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Norris, Clarence C1931.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Clarence Norris]]
[[File:Weems, Charlie C1931.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Charlie Weems]]

Dr. Bridges testified that his examination of Victoria Price found no vaginal tearing (which would have indicated rape), and that she had had semen in her for several hours. Ruby Bates failed to mention that either she or Price was raped until she was cross-examined.&lt;ref name=Weems2&gt;''Weems et al. v. State'', 1932, 141 So. 215, 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution ended with testimony from three men who claimed the black youths fought the white youths, put them off the train, and "took charge" of the white girls. The prosecution rested without calling any of the white youths as witness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the defense testimony, defendant Charles Weems testified that he was not part of the fight, that Patterson had the pistol, and that he had not seen the white girls on the train until the train pulled into Paint Rock.{{citation needed|date = June 2016}}

Defendant Clarence Norris stunned the courtroom by implicating the other defendants. He denied participating in the fight or being in the [[Gondola (rail)|gondola car]] where the fight took place. But he said that he saw the alleged rapes by the other blacks from his spot atop the next boxcar.&lt;ref name=Weems2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense put on no further witnesses.{{citation needed|date = June 2016}}

During closing, the prosecution said, "If you don't give these men death sentences, the [[electric chair]] might as well be abolished."&lt;ref name=Acker25&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense made no [[closing argument]], nor did it address the sentencing of the death penalty for their clients.&lt;ref name=Acker25 /&gt;

The Court started the next case while the jury was still deliberating the first. The first jury deliberated less than two hours before returning a guilty verdict and imposed the death sentence on both Weems and Norris.&lt;ref name=Acker26&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patterson trial===
[[File:Patterson, Haywood C1931.jpg|thumb|upright|Haywood Patterson]]

The trial for Haywood Patterson occurred while the Norris and Weems cases were still under consideration by the jury. When the jury returned its verdict from the first trial, the jury from the second trial was taken out of the courtroom. When the verdicts of guilty were announced, the courtroom erupted in cheers, as did the crowd outside. A band, there to play for a show of [[Ford Motor Company]] cars outside, began playing ''Hail, Hail the Gang's All Here'' and ''There'll be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight''.&lt;ref name=Acker26 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Patterson1&gt;''Patterson v. State'', 1932, 141 So. 195, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration was so loud that it was most likely heard by the second jury waiting inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Bellamy|first=Jay|date=Spring 2014|title=The Scottsboro Boys: Injustice in Alabama|url=https://www.archives.gov/files/publications/prologue/2014/spring/scottsboro.pdf|magazine=[[Prologue (magazine)|Prologue]]|doi=|pmid=|access-date=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the outburst, the defense of Patterson moved for a mistrial, but Judge Hawkins denied the motion and testimony continued.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The second trial continued. During the second trial's prosecution testimony, Victoria Price mostly stuck with her story, stating flatly that Patterson raped her. She accused Patterson of shooting one of the white youths. Price volunteered, "I have not had intercourse with any other white man but my husband. I want you to know that."&lt;ref name=Acker26 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Patterson1 /&gt;

Dr. Bridges repeated his testimony from the first trial.&lt;ref name=Patterson1 /&gt; Other witnesses testified that "the negroes" had gotten out of the same gondola car as Price and Bates; a farmer claimed to have seen white women [on the train] with the black youths.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterson defended his actions, testifying again that he had seen Price and Bates in the gondola car, but had nothing to do with them. On cross-examination he testified that he had seen "all but three of those negroes ravish that girl", but then changed his story. He said that he had not seen "any white women" until the train "got to Paint Rock."&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The younger Wright brother testified that Patterson was not involved with the girls, but that nine black teenagers had sex with the girls.&lt;ref name=Patterson1 /&gt; On cross examination, Roy Wright testified that Patterson "was not involved with the girls, but that, "The long, tall, black fellow had the pistol. He is not here." He claimed also to have been on top of the boxcar, and that Clarence Norris had a knife.&lt;ref&gt;''Patterson v. State'', 1932, 141 So. 195, 198–199.&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-defendants Andy Wright, Eugene Williams, and Ozie Powell all testified that they did not see any women on the train. Olen Montgomery testified that he sat alone on the train and did not know of any of the referenced events.&lt;ref name=Aretha39&gt;[[#refAretha2008|Aretha (2008)]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The jury quickly convicted Patterson and recommended death by electric chair.&lt;ref name=Aretha31 /&gt;

===Powell, Roberson, Williams, Montgomery and Wright trial===
This trial began within minutes of the previous case.

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Wright, Andy C1931.jpg|Andy Wright
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Price repeated her testimony, adding that the black teenagers split into two groups of six to rape her and Ruby Bates. Price accused Eugene Williams of holding the knife to her throat, and said that all of the other teenagers had knives.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Under cross examination she gave more detail,&lt;ref name=Aretha31&gt;[[#refAretha2008|Aretha (2008)]], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; adding that someone held a knife to the white teenager, Gilley, during the rapes.&lt;ref name=Aretha31 /&gt;

This trial was interrupted and the jury sent out when the Patterson jury reported; they found him guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAretha2008|Aretha (2008)]], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no uproar at the announcement. Ruby Bates took the stand, identifying all five defendants as among the 12 entering the gondola car, putting off the whites, and "ravishing" her and Price.&lt;ref name=Aretha31 /&gt;

Dr. Bridges was the next prosecution witness, repeating his earlier testimony. On cross examination, Bridges testified detecting no movement in the spermatozoa found in either woman, suggesting intercourse had taken place some time before. He also testified that defendant Willie Roberson was "diseased with syphilis and gonorrhea, a bad case of it." He admitted under questioning that Price told him that she had had sex with her husband and that Bates had earlier had intercourse as well, before the alleged rape events.&lt;ref name=Aretha33&gt;[[#refAretha2008|Aretha (2008)]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense called the only witnesses they had had time to find – the defendants. No new evidence was revealed.

The next prosecution witnesses testified that Roberson had run over train cars leaping from one to another, and that he was in much better shape than he claimed.&lt;ref name=Aretha33 /&gt; Sim Gilley testified that he saw "every one of those five in the gondola,"&lt;ref name=Powell1&gt;''Powell v. State'', 1932, 141 So. 201, 209.&lt;/ref&gt; but did not confirm that he had seen the women raped.

The defense again waived closing argument, and surprisingly the prosecution then proceeded to make more argument. The defense objected vigorously, but the Court allowed it.&lt;ref name=Powell1 /&gt;

Judge Hawkins then instructed the jury, stating that any defendant aiding in the crime was as guilty as any of the defendants who had committed it. The jury began deliberating at four in the afternoon.

===Roy Wright trial===
The prosecution agreed that 13-year-old Roy Wright&lt;ref name="UMKC-SB_acct"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTrials/scottsboro/SB_acct.html|title=The Trials of 'The Scottsboro Boys'|last=Linder|first=Douglas O.|authorlink=Doug Linder|date=1999|publisher=[[University of Missouri–Kansas City]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202232141/http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTrials/scottsboro/SB_acct.html|archive-date=December 2, 2016|dead-url=no|postscript=|work=Famous Trials|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was too young for the death penalty; it did not seek it. The prosecution presented only testimony from Price and Bates. His case went to the jury at nine that evening. His jury and that from the trial of five men were deliberating at the same time.

[[File:Wright, Roy C.1933.jpg|thumb|upright|Roy Wright]]

At nine on Thursday morning, April 9, 1931, the five defendants in Wednesday's trial were all found guilty. Roy Wright's jury could not agree on sentencing, and was declared a [[hung jury]] that afternoon. All the jurors agreed on his guilt, but seven insisted on the death sentence while five held out for life imprisonment (in cases like this, that was often an indication that the jurors believed the suspect was innocent but they were unwilling to go against community norms of conviction). Judge Hawkins declared a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]].&lt;ref name=Aretha34 /&gt;

===Death sentences===
The eight convicted defendants were assembled on April 9, 1931, and sentenced to death by electric chair. The [[Associated Press]] reported that the defendants were "calm" and "stoic" as Judge Hawkins handed down the death sentences one after another.&lt;ref name=Aretha34&gt;[[#refAretha2008|Aretha (2008)]], p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Hawkins set the executions for July 10, 1931, the earliest date Alabama law allowed. While [[appeals]] were filed, the Alabama Supreme Court issued indefinite stays of executions 72 hours before the defendants were scheduled to die. The men's cells were next to the [[execution chamber]], and they heard the July 10, 1931 execution of William Hokes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doc.state.al.us/execution.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421072131/http://www.doc.state.al.us/execution.asp |archivedate=April 21, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a black man from [[St. Clair County, Alabama|St. Clair County]] convicted of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Chris| first =Norwood| title =Capital punishment remains fairly common in Alabama| newspaper =The Daily Home| location =Talladega, Alabama| publisher =Radiate Media| date =January 8, 2011| url =http://www.dailyhome.com/view/full_story/10945246/article-Capital-punishment-remains-fairly-common-in-Alabama| accessdate = November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later recalled that he "died hard."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Help from Communist Party and NAACP===
After a demonstration in [[Harlem]], the [[Communist Party USA]] took an interest in the Scottsboro case. Chattanooga Party member James Allen edited the Communist ''[[Southern Worker]]'', and publicized "the plight of the boys".&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The Party used its legal arm, the [[International Labor Defense]] (ILD), to take up their cases,&lt;ref&gt;"A wing of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, devoted to the defense of people it perceived as victims of a class war. The ILD saw African Americans in the deep South as an oppressed nation that needed liberation." [http://www.courttv.com/archive/greatesttrials/scottsboro/players.html ''Greatest Trials''], Court TV.&lt;/ref&gt; and persuaded the defendants' parents to let the party champion their cause. The ILD retained attorneys [[George W. Chamlee]], who filed the first motions, and Joseph Brodsky.

The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] also offered to handle the case, offering the services of famed criminal defense attorney [[Clarence Darrow]]. However, the Scottsboro defendants decided to let the ILD handle their appeal.&lt;ref name=UMKC-SB_acct /&gt;

Chamlee moved for new trials for all defendants. Private investigations took place, revealing that Price and Bates had been [[prostitutes]] in Tennessee, who regularly serviced both black and white clientele.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAretha2008|Aretha (2008)]], p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Chamlee offered judge Hawkins affidavits to that effect, but the judge forbade him to read them out loud. The defense argued that this evidence proved that the two women had likely lied at trial.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Chamlee pointed to the uproar in Scottsboro that occurred when the verdicts were reported as further evidence that the change of venue should have been granted.

===Appeal to Alabama Supreme Court===
Following Judge Hawkins' denial of the motions for new trial, attorney George W. Chamlee filed an appeal and was granted a stay of execution. Chamlee was joined by Communist Party attorney Joseph Brodsky and ILD attorney [[Irving Schwab]]. The defense team argued that their clients had not had adequate representation, had insufficient time for counsel to prepare their cases, had their juries intimidated by the crowd, and finally, that it was unconstitutional for blacks to have been excluded from the jury. In the question of procedural errors, the state Supreme Court found none.

===Williams' ruling===
On March 24, 1932, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled against seven of the eight remaining Scottsboro Boys, confirming the convictions and death sentences of all but the 13-year-old Eugene Williams. It upheld seven of eight rulings from the lower court.

The Alabama Supreme Court granted 13-year-old Eugene Williams a new trial because he was a juvenile, which saved him from the immediate threat of the electric chair.&lt;ref&gt;''Powell v. State'', Id., at p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weems and Norris ruling===
The Court upheld the lower court's change of venue decision, upheld the testimony of Ruby Bates, and reviewed the testimony of the various witnesses. As to the "newly discovered evidence", the Court ruled: "There is no contention on the part of the defendants, that they had sexual intercourse with the alleged victim ... with her consent ... so the defendants would not be granted a new trial."&lt;ref name=WvS32&gt;''Weems et al. v. State'', 1932, 141 So. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

As to representation, the Court found "that the defendants were represented by counsel who thoroughly cross examined the state's witnesses, and presented such evidence as was available."&lt;ref name=WvS32 /&gt;  Again, the Court affirmed these convictions as well. The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed seven of the eight convictions and rescheduled the executions.

====Dissent====
Chief Justice John C. Anderson dissented, agreeing with the defense in many of its motions. Anderson stated that the defendants had not been accorded a fair trial and strongly dissented to the decision to affirm their sentences.&lt;ref&gt;141 So. 215, 1932, 195, 201.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "While the constitution guarantees to the accused a speedy trial, it is of greater importance that it should be by a fair and impartial jury, ''[[ex vi termini]]'' ("by definition"), a jury free from bias or prejudice, and, above all, from coercion and intimidation."&lt;ref name=WeemsetalvState214&gt;''Weems et al. v. State'', Id., at 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

He pointed out that the National Guard had shuttled the defendants back and forth each day from jail, and that &lt;blockquote&gt;this fact alone was enough to have a coercive effect on the jury.&lt;ref name=WeemsetalvState214 /&gt;&lt;!--Deleted image removed: [[File:Anderson, John Crawford.jpg|thumb|Chief Justice John Anderson]]--&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Anderson criticized how the defendants were represented. He noted that Roddy "declined to appear as appointed counsel and did so only as ''[[amicus curiae]]''." He continued, "These defendants were confined in jail in another county ... and local counsel had little opportunity to ... prepare their defense."&lt;ref name=WeemsetalvState214 /&gt; Moreover, they "would have been represented by able counsel had a better opportunity been given."&lt;ref name=WeemsetalvState214 /&gt; Justice Anderson also pointed out the failure of the defense to make closing arguments as an example of underzealous defense representation.&lt;ref name=WeemsetalvState214 /&gt; About the courtroom outburst, Justice Anderson noted that "there was great applause ... and this was bound to have influence."&lt;ref name=WeemsetalvState215&gt;''Weems et al. v. State'', Id., at 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson noted that, as the punishment for rape ranged between ten years and death, some of the teenagers should have been found "less culpable than others", and therefore should have received lighter sentences. Anderson concluded, "No matter how revolting the accusation, how clear the proof, or how degraded or even brutal, the offender, the Constitution, the law, the very genius of Anglo-American liberty demand a fair and impartial trial."&lt;ref name=WeemsetalvState215 /&gt;

===Appeal to United States Supreme Court===
{{Main|Powell v. Alabama}}

The case went to the United States Supreme Court on October 10, 1932, amidst tight security. The ILD retained [[Walter Pollak]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fac.org/about.aspx?item=First_Amendment_lawyers |title=Bio of Walter Pollak |publisher=Fac.org |date=November 8, 1974 |accessdate=September 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716022314/http://www.fac.org/about.aspx?item=First_Amendment_lawyers |archivedate=July 16, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to handle the appeal. Alabama Attorney General Thomas Knight, Jr. represented the State.

Pollak argued that the defendants had been denied due process first due to the mob atmosphere, and second, because of the strange attorney appointment and their poor performance at trial. Last, he argued that African Americans were systematically excluded from jury duty contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.

Knight countered that there had been no mob atmosphere at the trial, and pointed to the finding by the Alabama Supreme Court that the trial had been fair and representation "able." He told the Court that he had "no apologies" to make.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In a landmark decision, the [[United States Supreme Court]] reversed the convictions on the ground that the due process clause of the [[United States Constitution]] guarantees the effective assistance of counsel at a criminal trial. In an opinion written by [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[George Sutherland]], the Court found the defendants had been denied effective counsel. Chief Justice Anderson's previous dissent was quoted repeatedly in this decision.

The Court did not fault Moody and Roddy for lack of an effective defense, noting that both had told Judge Hawkins that they had not had time to prepare their cases. They said the problem was with the way Judge Hawkins "immediately hurried to trial."&lt;ref name="Powell v. Alabama 1932"/&gt; This conclusion did not find the Scottsboro defendants innocent, but ruled that the procedures violated their rights to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Supreme Court sent the case back to Judge Hawkins for a retrial.

==Decatur trials==
When the case, by now a ''cause celebre'', came back to Judge Hawkins, he granted the request for a change of venue. The defense had urged for a move to the city of [[Birmingham, Alabama]], but the case was transferred to the small, rural community of [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]]. This was near homes of the alleged victims and in [[Ku Klux Klan]] territory.&lt;ref name=Linder554 /&gt;''

The [[American Communist Party]] maintained control over defense of the case, retaining the New York criminal defense attorney [[Samuel Leibowitz]]. He had never lost a murder trial and was a registered Democrat, with no connection to the Communist Party. They kept Joseph Brodsky as the second chair for the trial.

The case was assigned to District Judge [[James Edwin Horton]] and tried in [[Morgan County, Alabama|Morgan County]]. His appointment to the case drew local praise. The judge carried a loaded pistol in his car throughout the time he presided over these cases.{{why?|date=November 2013}}&lt;ref name=Linder554&gt;Douglas O. Linder, ''Without Fear or Favor: Judge James Edwin Horton and the Trial of the "Scottsville Boys"''., at p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two years that had passed since the first trials had not dampened community hostility for the Scottsboro Boys. But others believed they were victims of [[Jim Crow]] justice, and the case was covered by numerous national newspapers.

At the trial, some 100 reporters were seated at the press tables. Hundreds more gathered on the courthouse lawn. [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] members in plain clothes mingled in the crowd, looking for any sign of trouble. The Sheriff's department brought the defendants to Court in a patrol wagon guarded by two carloads of deputies armed with automatic shotguns.

In the courtroom, the Scottsboro Boys sat in a row wearing blue prison denims and guarded by National Guardsmen, except for Roy Wright, who had not been convicted. Wright wore street clothes. The ''[[Birmingham News]]'' described him as "dressed up like a Georgia [[gigolo]]."&lt;ref name=Linder555&gt;Linder, ''Without Fear or Favor'', p. 555.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibowitz asserted his trust in the "God fearing people of Decatur and Morgan County";&lt;ref name=Linder555 /&gt; he made a pretrial motion to quash the indictment on the ground that blacks had been systematically excluded from the grand jury. Although the motion was denied, this got the issue in the record for future appeals. To this motion, Attorney General Thomas Knight responded, "The State will concede nothing. Put on your case."&lt;ref name=Linder555 /&gt;

Leibowitz called the editor of the Scottsboro weekly newspaper, who testified that he'd never heard of a black juror in Decatur because "they all steal."&lt;ref name=Linder556&gt;Douglas O. Linder, ''Without Fear or Favor: Judge James Edwin Horton and the Trial of the "Scottsville Boys,"'' p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt;  He called local jury commissioners to explain the absence of African-Americans from Jackson County juries. When Leibowitz accused them of excluding black men from juries, they did not seem to understand his accusation. It was as if the exclusion was so ordinary as to be unconscious.&lt;ref name=Goodman121&gt;James Goodman, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: Since most blacks could not vote after having been disenfranchised by the [[Constitution of Alabama|Alabama constitution]], the local jury commissioners probably never thought about them as potential jurors, who were limited to voters.)

Leibowitz called local black professionals as witnesses to show they were qualified for jury service. Leibowitz called John Sanford, an African-American of Scottsboro, who was educated, well-spoken, and respected. The defense attorney showed that "Mr. Sanford" was evidently qualified in all manner except by virtue of his race to be a candidate for participation in a jury. During the following cross examination, Knight addressed the witness by his first name, "John." The first two times that he did so, Leibowitz asked the court to have him alter his behavior. He did not, and this insult eventually caused Leibowitz to leap to his feet saying, "Now listen, Mr. Attorney-General, I've warned you twice about your treatment of my witness. For the last time now, stand back, take your finger out of his eye, and call him mister", causing gasps from the public seated in the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;James Goodman, pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt; The judge abruptly interrupted Leibowitz.&lt;ref name=Acker59&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the pretrial motion to quash the indictment was denied, Leibowitz had positioned the case for appeal. The issue of composition of the jury was addressed in a second landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that race could not be used to exclude anyone from candidacy for participation on a jury anywhere in the United States. This astonished (and infuriated) many residents of Alabama and many other Southern states.

===Patterson trial===
{{see also|Patterson v. Alabama}}
Judge Horton called the first case against Haywood Patterson and began jury selection. Leibowitz objected that African-American jurors had been excluded from the jury pool. He called the jury commissioner to the stand, asking if there were any blacks on the juror rolls, and when told yes, suggested his answer was not honest.&lt;ref name=Linder556 /&gt; The locals resented his questioning of the official and "chewed their tobacco meditatively."&lt;ref name=Linder557&gt;Linder, p. 557.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Guard posted five men with fixed bayonets in front of Leibowitz's residence that night.&lt;ref name=Linder557 /&gt;  The jury was selected by the end of the day on Friday and sequestered in the Lyons Hotel.&lt;ref name=Linder557 /&gt;

[[File:Thomas E. Knight.jpg|thumb|Attorney General Thomas Knight, Jr]]

A large crowd gathered outside the court house for the start of the Patterson trial on Monday, April 2. Without the "vivid detail" she had used in the Scottsboro trials, Victoria Price told her account in 16 minutes.&lt;ref name=Linder560&gt;Linder, p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense had what she had said before under oath on paper, and could confront her with any inconsistencies. The only drama came when Knight pulled a torn pair of step-ins from his brief case and tossed them into the lap of a juror to support the claim of rape.&lt;ref name=Linder560 /&gt;

Leibowitz used a 32-foot model train set up on a table in front of the witness stand to illustrate where each of the parties was during the alleged events, and other points of his defense.&lt;ref name=Linder560 /&gt; When asked if the model in front of her was like the train where she claimed she was raped, Price cracked, "It was bigger. Lots bigger. That is a toy."&lt;ref name=Linder560 /&gt; Leibowitz later conceded that Price was "one of the toughest witnesses he ever cross examined."&lt;ref name=Linder5601&gt;Linder, pp. 560–561.&lt;/ref&gt; Her answers were evasive and derisive. She often replied, "I can't remember" or "I won't say." Once when Leibowitz confronted her with a contradiction in her testimony, she exclaimed, sticking a finger in the direction of defendant Patterson, "One thing I will never forget is that one sitting right there raped me."&lt;ref name=Linder560 /&gt;  The attorney tried to question her about a conviction for fornication and adultery in Huntsville, but the court sustained a prosecution objection.&lt;ref name=Linder5601 /&gt;

Price insisted that she had spent the evening before the alleged rape at the home of a Mrs. Callie Brochie in Chattanooga. Leibowitz asked her whether she had spent the evening in a "hobo jungle" in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], with a Lester Carter and Jack Tiller, but she denied it. Leibowitz said that Callie Brochie was a fictional character in a ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' short story and suggested that Price's stay with her had been equally fictional.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Price, Victoria in Decatur 1933.jpg|thumb|Victoria Price responded on cross-examination at the trial: "You're a pretty good actor yourself, Mr. Leibowitz"]]

As the historian James Goodman wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Price was not the first hardened witness [Leibowitz] had faced, and certainly not the most depraved. Nor was she the first witness who tried to stare him down and, failing that, who seemed as if she were about to leap out of her seat and strike him. She was not the first witness to be evasive, sarcastic and crude. She was, however, the first witness to use her bad memory, truculence, and total lack of refinement, and at times, even ignorance, to great advantage.&lt;ref name=Goodman127&gt;Goodman, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of the whites in the court room likely resented Leibowitz as a Jew from New York hired by the Communists, and for his treatment of a southern white woman, even a low-class one, as a hostile witness.&lt;ref name=Goodman127 /&gt; Some wondered if there was any way he could leave Decatur alive.  The National Guard Captain Joe Burelson promised Judge Horton that he would protect Leibowitz and the defendants "as long as we have a piece of ammunition or a man alive."&lt;ref name=Goodman127 /&gt; Once Captain Burelson learned that a group was on their way to "take care of Leibowitz", he raised the drawbridge across the [[Tennessee River]], keeping them out of Decatur.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

Judge Horton learned that the prisoners were in danger from locals. Once he sent out the jury and warned the courtroom, "I want it to be known that these prisoners are under the protection of this court. This court intends to protect these prisoners and any other persons engaged in this trial."&lt;ref&gt;Linder, p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt; Threats of violence came from the North as well. One letter from [[Chicago]] read, "When those Boys are dead, within six months your state will lose 500 lives."&lt;ref name=Linder566&gt;Goodman, p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bridges, RR in Decatur.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. R.R. Bridges testifying in Decatur]]

Leibowitz systematically dismantled each prosecution witness' story under cross-examination. He got Dr. Bridges to admit on cross-examination that "the best you can say about the whole case is that both of these women showed they had sexual intercourse."&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Paint Rock ticket agent W. H. Hill testified to seeing the women and the black youths in the same car, but on cross-examination admitted to not seeing the women at all until they got off the train. Posse member Tom Rousseau claimed to have seen the women and youths get off the same car but under cross-examination admitted finding the defendants scattered in various cars at the front of the train. Lee Adams testified that he had seen the fight, but later saying that he was a quarter mile from the tracks. Ory Dobbins repeated that he'd seen the women try to jump off the train, but Leibowitz showed photos of the positions of the parties that proved Dobbins could not have seen everything he claimed. Dobbins insisted he had seen the girls wearing women's clothing, but other witnesses had testified they were in overalls.&lt;ref&gt;James Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution withdrew the testimony of Dr. Marvin Lynch, the other examining doctor, as "repetitive." Many years later, Judge Horton said that Dr. Lynch confided that the women had not been raped and had laughed when he examined them. He said that if he testified for the defense, his practice in Jackson County would be over. Thinking Patterson would be acquitted, Judge Horton did not force Dr. Lynch to testify, but the judge had become convinced the defendants were innocent.&lt;ref name=Linder564&gt;Linder, p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Defense====
Leibowitz began his defense by calling Chattanooga resident Dallas Ramsey, who testified that his home was next to the hobo jungle mentioned earlier. He said that he had seen both Price and Bates get on a train there with a white man on the morning of the alleged rape.&lt;ref&gt;James Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Train fireman Percy Ricks testified that he saw the two women slipping along the side of the train right after it stopped in Paint Rock, as if they were trying to escape the posse. Leibowitz put on the testimony of Chattanooga gynecologist, Dr. Edward A. Reisman, who testified that after a woman had been raped by six men, it was impossible that she would have only a trace of semen, as was found in this case.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibowitz next called Lester Carter, a white man who testified that he had had intercourse with Bates. Jack Tiller, another white, said he had had sex with Price, two days before the alleged rapes. He testified that he had been on the train on the morning of the arrests. He had heard Price ask Orville Gilley, a white youth, to confirm that she had been raped. However, Gilley had told her to "go to hell." Morgan County Solicitor Wade Wright cross-examined Carter. Wright tried to get Carter to admit that the Communist Party had bought his testimony, which Carter denied. But he said that the defense attorney Joseph Brodsky had paid his rent and bought him a new suit for the trial.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five of the original nine Scottsboro defendants testified that they had not seen Price or Bates until after the train stopped in Paint Rock. Willie Roberson testified that he was suffering from syphilis, with sores that prevented him from walking, and that he was in a car at the back of the train.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

Olen Montgomery testified that he had been alone on a tank car the entire trip, and had not known about the fight or alleged rapes. Ozie Powell said that while he was not a participant, he had seen the fight with the white teenagers from his vantage point between a box car and a gondola car, where he had been hanging on. He said he saw the white teenagers jump off the train. Roberson, Montgomery, and Powell all denied they had known each other or the other defendants before that day. Andy Wright, Eugene Williams, and Haywood Patterson testified that they had previously known each other, but had not seen the women until the train stopped in Paint Rock. Knight questioned them extensively about instances in which their testimony supposedly differed from their testimony at their trial in Scottsboro. They did not contradict themselves in any meaningful way.&lt;ref name=Autogenerated129&gt;James Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haywood Patterson testified on his own behalf that he had not seen the women before stopping in Paint Rock; he withstood a cross examination from Knight who "shouted, shook his finger at, and ran back and forth in front of the defendant."&lt;ref name=Autogenerated566&gt;Linder, ''Without Fear or Favor'', at p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Knight demanded, "You were tried at Scottsboro?" Patterson snapped, "I was framed at Scottsboro." Knight thundered, "Who told you to say that?" Patterson replied, "I told myself to say it."&lt;ref name=Autogenerated566 /&gt;

Just after the defense rested "with reservations", someone handed Leibowitz a note. The attorneys approached the bench for a hushed conversation, which was followed by a short recess. Leibowitz called one final witness. Thus far in the trial, Ruby Bates had been notably absent. She had disappeared from her home in Huntsville weeks before the new trial, and every sheriff in Alabama had been ordered to search for her, to no avail.&lt;ref name=Acker59/&gt; Now, two guardsmen with bayonets opened the courtroom doors, and Bates entered, "in stylish clothes, eyes downcast."&lt;ref name=Linder567&gt;Linder, ''Without Fear or Favor'', p. 567.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her dramatic and unexpected entrance drew stares from the residents of the courtroom. Victoria Price, brought out for Bates to identify, glared at her. Attorney General Knight warned Price to "keep your temper."&lt;ref name=Linder567 /&gt; Bates proceeded to testify, and explained that no rape had occurred. She said none of the defendants had touched her or even spoken to her. When asked if she had been raped on March 25, 1931, Bates said, "No sir." When asked why she had initially said she had been raped, Bates replied, "I told it just like Victoria did because she said we might have to stay in jail if we did not frame up a story after crossing a state line with men." Bates explained that Price had said "she didn't care if all the Negroes in Alabama were put in jail." This recantation seemed to be a severe blow to the prosecution.&lt;ref name=Linder567 /&gt;

Bates admitted having intercourse with Lester Carter in the Huntsville railway yards two days before making accusations. Finally, she testified she had been in New York City and had decided to return to Alabama to tell the truth, at the urging of Rev. [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]] of that city.&lt;ref name=Linder567 /&gt;
[[File:Harry Emerson Fosdick.jpg|thumb|upright|Rev. Harry Emerson Fosdick]]
[[File:Bates, Ruby.jpg|thumb|upright|Ruby Bates testifying.]]

With his eye tuned to the southern jury, Knight cross-examined her. He noted her stylish dress and demanded where she had gotten her fine clothes. When she responded that the Communist Party had paid for her clothes, any credibility she had with the jury was destroyed. Judge Horton warned spectators to stop laughing at her testimony or he would eject them.&lt;ref name=Linder567 /&gt;{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

===Closing arguments===
By the time Leibowitz closed, the prosecution had employed anti-semitic remarks to discredit him.&lt;ref name=Goodman132&gt;James Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; Wade Wright added to this, referring to Ruby's boyfriend Lester Carter as "Mr. Caterinsky" and called him "the prettiest Jew" he ever saw. He said, "Don't you know these defense witnesses are bought and paid for? May the Lord have mercy on the soul of Ruby Bates. Now the question in this case is this—Is justice in the case going to be bought and sold in Alabama with Jew money from New York?"&lt;ref name=Goodman132 /&gt;

Leibowitz objected and moved for a new trial. Judge Horton refused to grant a new trial, telling the jury to "put [the remarks] out of your minds."&lt;ref&gt;Linder, ''Without Fear or Favor'', p. 568.&lt;/ref&gt; One author describes Wright's closing argument as "the now-famous Jew-baiting summary to the jury."&lt;ref name="deal"/&gt; He goes on to say that, "Until Wright spoke, many of the newspapermen felt that there was an outside chance for acquittal, at least a hung jury. But ... From then on the defense was helpless."&lt;ref name="deal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newdeal.feri.org/nation/na33465.htm |title=The South Speaks |publisher=Newdeal.feri.org |accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his closing, Leibowitz called Wright's argument an appeal to regional bigotry, claiming talk about Communists was just to "befuddle" the jury. He described himself as a patriot, a "Roosevelt Democrat", who had served the "[[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]]" in World War I, "when there was no talk of Jew or Gentile, white or black."&lt;ref name="Goodman, pp. 132"&gt;Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; As to Wright's reference to "Jew money", Leibowitz said that he was defending the Scottsboro Boys for nothing and was personally paying the expenses of his wife, who had accompanied him.&lt;ref name="Goodman, pp. 132"/&gt;

"I'm interested", Leibowitz argued, "solely in seeing that that poor, moronic colored boy over there and his co-defendants in the other cases get a square shake of the dice, because I believe, before God, they are the victims of a dastardly frame up."&lt;ref name=Goodman133_134&gt;Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', pp. 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt; He called Price's testimony "a foul, contemptible, outrageous lie."&lt;ref name=Goodman133_134 /&gt; He ended with the [[Lord's Prayer]] and a challenge to either acquit or render the death sentence—nothing in between.&lt;ref name=Goodman133_134 /&gt;

Attorney General Knight delivered his rebuttal, roaring that if the jury found Haywood not guilty, they ought to "put a garland of roses around his neck, give him a supper, and send him to New York City." Considering the evidence, he continued, "there can be but one verdict—death in the electric chair for raping Victoria Price."&lt;ref&gt;Linder, ''Without Fear or Favor'', p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verdict===
The jury began deliberating Saturday afternoon and announced it had a verdict at ten the next morning, while many residents of Decatur were in church.  The jury foreman, Eugene Bailey, handed the handwritten verdict to Judge Horton.  The jury found the defendant guilty of rape, and sentenced Patterson to death in the electric chair.&lt;ref name=Linder571&gt;Linder, ''Without Fear or Favor'', p. 571.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bailey had held out for eleven hours for life in prison, but in the end agreed to the death sentence.&lt;ref name=Linder571 /&gt;

According to one account, juror [[Irwin Craig]] held out against imposition of the death penalty, because he thought that Patterson was innocent.&lt;ref name=Guardian13&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/04/scottsboro-boys-pardon-alabama-senate-house?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Scottsboro Boys pardon nears as Alabama comes to terms with its past |accessdate=February 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irwin Craig====
'''Irwin "Red" Craig''' (died 1970) (nicknamed from the color of his hair) was the sole [[juror]] to refuse to impose the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] in the retrial of [[Haywood Patterson]], one of the Scottsboro Boys, in what was then the small town of [[Decatur, Alabama]]. His son, Sonny, later recalled him as saying: "Those young men were innocent; everybody knew that but they were going to be punished for what they didn't do." The [[Ku Klux Klan]] staked a [[burning cross]] in his family yard.

He was called in to see the judge presiding over that retrial, [[James Edwin Horton|James Horton]], who exhorted him to change his vote to guilty. "If you don't, they will kill you, Red", said the judge. Craig protested: "I can't change my vote, judge." Horton replied: "Don't worry about that, I'll take care of it."&lt;ref name=Guardian13/&gt;

===Horton grants Patterson a new trial===
The defense moved for a retrial and, believing the defendants innocent, Judge [[James Edwin Horton]] agreed to set aside the guilty verdict for Patterson. Horton ruled the rest of defendants could not get a fair trial at that time and indefinitely postponed the rest of the trials, knowing it would cost him his job when he ran for re-election.&lt;ref&gt;Linder, ''Without Fear or Favor'', p. 573.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Horton heard arguments on the motion for new trial in the [[Limestone County, Alabama|Limestone County]] Court House in [[Athens, Alabama]], where he read his decision to the astonished defense and a furious Knight: {{quote|These women are shown ... to have falsely accused two Negroes ... This tendency on the part of the women shows that they are predisposed to make false accusations... The Court will not pursue the evidence any further.}} Horton ordered a new trial— which would turn out to be the third for Patterson.

When Judge Horton announced his decision, Knight stated that he would retry Patterson. He said that he had found Orville "Carolina Slim" Gilley, the white teenager in the gondola car, and that Gilley would corroborate Price's story in full. At Knight's request, the court replaced Judge Horton with Judge William Washington Callahan, described as a racist. He later instructed the jury in the next round of trials that no white woman would voluntarily have sex with a black man.&lt;ref&gt;Linder, ''Without Fear or Favor'', pp. 576–577.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New trials under Callahan===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gov. Benjamin Meek Miller.jpg|thumb|upright|Gov. Benjamin Meek Miller]] --&gt;

During the Decatur retrial, held from November 1933 to July 1937, Judge Callahan wanted to take the case off "the front pages of America's newspapers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doug Linder |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTrials/scottsboro/SB_bCalla.html |title=Retrial by Judge Callahan |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He banned photographers from the courthouse grounds and typewriters from his court room.&lt;ref name=Linder571 /&gt; "There ain't going to be no more picture snappin' round here", he ordered. He also imposed a strict three-day time limit on each trial, running them into the evening.&lt;ref name=Acker102&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; He removed protection from the defense, convincing Governor [[Benjamin Meek Miller]] to keep the National Guard away.

The defense moved for another change of venue, submitting affidavits in which hundreds of residents stated their intense dislike for the defendants, to show there was "overwhelming prejudice" against them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution countered with testimony that some of the quotes in the affidavits were untrue, and that six of the people quoted were dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense countered that they had received numerous death threats, and the judge replied that he and the prosecution had received more from the Communists. The motion was denied.&lt;ref name=Goodman216&gt;James Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibowitz led Commissioner Moody and Jackson County Circuit Clerk C.A. Wann through every page of the Jackson County jury roll to show that it contained no names of African-Americans. When, after several hours of reading names, Commissioner Moody finally claimed several names to be of African-Americans,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibowitz got handwriting samples from all present. One man admitted that the handwriting appeared to be his. Leibowitz called in a handwriting expert, who testified that names identified as African-American had been added later to the list, and signed by former Jury Commissioner Morgan.&lt;ref name=Acker110&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Callahan did not rule that excluding people by race was constitutional, only that the defense had not proven that African-Americans had been deliberately excluded. By letting Leibowitz go on record on this issue, Judge Callahan provided grounds for the case to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court for a second time. It was the basis for the court's finding in ''[[Norris v. Alabama]]'' (1935), that an exclusion of African-American grand jurors had occurred, violating the due process clause of the Constitution.

Haywood Patterson's Decatur retrial began on November 27, 1933. Thirty-six potential jurors admitted having a "fixed opinion" in the case,&lt;ref name=Acker110 /&gt; which caused Leibowitz to move for a change of venue. Callahan denied the motion.&lt;ref name=Goodman216 /&gt; Callahan excluded defense evidence that Horton had admitted, at one point exclaiming to Leibowitz, "Judge Horton can't help you [now]."&lt;ref name=Acker102 /&gt; He routinely sustained prosecution objections but overruled defense objections.

Price testified again that a dozen armed negro men entered the gondola car. She said Patterson had fired a shot and ordered all whites but Gilley off the train.&lt;ref name=Goodman221&gt;James Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; She said the negros had ripped her clothes off and repeatedly raped her at knife point, and pointed out Patterson as one of the rapists.&lt;ref name=Goodman224&gt;James Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; She said they raped her and Bates, afterward saying they would take them north or throw them in the river.&lt;ref name=Acker110 /&gt; She testified that she had fallen while getting out of the gondola car, passed out and came to seated in a store at Paint Rock. Leibowitz questioned her until Judge Callahan stopped court for the day at 6:30. When he resumed the next morning, he pointed out many contradictions among her various versions of the rape.

Judge Callahan repeatedly interrupted Leibowitz's cross-examination of Price, calling defense questions "arguing with the witness", "immaterial, "useless", "a waste of time" and even "illegal."&lt;ref name=Acker111&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The many contradictions notwithstanding, Price steadfastly stuck to her testimony that Patterson had raped her.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orville Gilley's testimony at Patterson's Decatur retrial was a mild sensation.&lt;ref name=Goodman224/&gt; He denied being a "bought witness", repeating his testimony about armed blacks ordering the white teenagers off the train.&lt;ref name=Goodman221/&gt; He confirmed Price's rape account, adding that he stopped the rape by convincing the "negro" with the gun to make the rapists stop "before they killed that woman."&lt;ref name=Goodman225&gt;Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibowitz cross-examined him at length about contradictions between his account and Price's testimony, but he remained "unruffled."&lt;ref name=Goodman225/&gt; Gilley testified to meeting Lester Carter and the women the evening before the alleged rapes, and getting them coffee and sandwiches. Callahan interrupted before Leibowitz could find out if Gilley went "somewhere with [the women]" that night.&lt;ref&gt;F. Raymond Daniell, ''The New York Times'', November 19, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution called several white farmers who testified that they had seen the fight on the train and saw the girls "a-fixin' to get out", but they saw the defendants drag them back.&lt;ref name=Goodman221 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodman226/&gt;

Lester Carter took the stand for the defense. He had testified in the first Decatur trial that Price and Bates had had sex with him and Gilley in the hobo jungle in Chattanooga prior to the alleged rapes, which could account for the semen found in the women. But Judge Callahan would not let him repeat that testimony at the trial, stating that any such testimony was "immaterial."

Ruby Bates was apparently too sick to travel. She had had surgery in New York, and at one point Leibowitz requested that her deposition be taken as a [[dying declaration]]. While she was not dying, committed to his three-day time limit for the trial, Judge Callahan denied the request to arrange to take her deposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the defense needed her testimony, by the time a deposition arrived, the case had gone to the jury and they did not hear it at all.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', pp. 225–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haywood Patterson took the stand, admitting he had "cussed" at the white teenagers, but only because they cussed at him first. He denied seeing the white women before Paint Rock. On cross-examination Knight confronted him with previous testimony from his Scottsboro trial that he had not touched the women, but that he had seen the other five defendants rape them. Leibowitz objected, stating that the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled previous testimony illegal. Judge Callahan allowed it, although he would not allow testimony by Patterson stating that he had not seen the women before Paint Rock.&lt;ref name=Goodman226&gt;Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Patterson explained contradictions in his testimony: "We was scared and I don't know what I said. They told us if we didn't confess they'd kill us—give us to the mob outside."&lt;ref name=Daniell1933&gt;"Raymond Daniell, ''The New York Times'', November 19, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterson claimed the threats had been made by guards and militiamen while the defendants were in the Jackson County jail. He said threats were made even in the presence of the judge. Patterson pointed at H.G. Bailey, prosecutor in his Scottsboro trial, stating, "And Mr. Bailey over there—he said send all the niggers to the electric chair. There's too many niggers in the world anyway."&lt;ref name=Daniell1933 /&gt;

Closing arguments were made November 29 through November 30, without stopping for Thanksgiving. Callahan limited each side to two hours of argument.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight declared in his closing that the prosecution was not avenging what the defendants had done to Price. "What has been done to her cannot be undone. What you can do now is to make sure that it doesn't happen to some other woman." Leibowitz objected that the argument was "an appeal to passion and prejudice" and moved for a mistrial. Knight agreed that it was an appeal to passion, and Callahan overruled the motion. Knight continued, "We all have a passion, all men in this court room to protect the womanhood in Alabama."&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; For his summation, solicitor Wade Wright reviewed the testimony and warned the jury, "that this crime could have happened to any woman, even though she was riding in a parlor car, instead of box car."&lt;ref name=Goodman226 /&gt;

Solicitor H.G. Bailey reminded the jury that the law presumed Patterson innocent, even if what Gilley and Price had described was "as sordid as ever a human tongue has uttered." Finally he defended the women, "Instead of painting their faces ... they were brave enough to go to Chattanooga and look for honest work."&lt;ref name=Goodman226 /&gt; Bailey attacked the defense case.&lt;blockquote&gt;They say this is a frame-up! They have been yelling frame-up ever since this case started! Who framed them? Did Ory Dobbins frame them? Did brother Hill frame them? We did a lot of awful things over there is Scottsboro, didn't we? My, my, my. And now they come over here and try to convince you that that sort of thing happened in your neighboring county.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, ''Stories of Scottsboro'', pp. 226–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Judge Callahan charged the jury that Price and Bates could have been raped without force, just by withholding their consent. He instructed them, "Where the woman charged to have been raped is white, there is a strong presumption under the law that she will not and did not yield voluntarily to intercourse with the defendant, a Negro."&lt;ref name=Goodman227&gt;Goodman, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; He instructed the jury that if Patterson was so much as present for the "purpose of aiding, encouraging, assisting or abetting" the rapes "in any way", he was as guilty as the person who committed the rapes.&lt;ref name=Goodman227 /&gt;

He told them that they did not need to find corroboration of Price's testimony. If they believed her, that was enough to convict. Judge Callahan said he was giving them two forms – one for conviction and one for acquittal, but he supplied the jury with only a form to convict. He supplied them with an acquittal form only after the prosecution, fearing reversible error, urged him do so.&lt;ref name=Linder577&gt;Linder, ''Without Fear or Favor'', at p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt;

As ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described it, "Twenty-six hours later came a resounding thump on the brown wooden jury room door. The bailiff let the jurors out [from the Patterson trial]. The foreman unfisted a moist crumpled note, handed it to the clerk. A thin smile faded from Patterson's lips as the clerk read his third death sentence."&lt;ref&gt;''Time Magazine'', December 11, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1934, despite having run unopposed in the previous election for the position, James Horton was soundly defeated when he ran for re-election as a circuit judge. The vote against him was especially heavy in Morgan County. In the same election, Thomas Knight was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;Linder, ''Without Fear or Favor'', p. 580&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norris' retrial===
Judge Callahan started jury selection for the trial of defendant Norris on November 30, 1933, Thanksgiving afternoon. At this trial, Victoria Price testified that two of her alleged assailants had pistols, that they threw off the white teenagers, that she tried to jump off but was grabbed, thrown onto the gravel in the gondola, one of them held her legs, and one held a knife on her, and one raped both her and Ruby Bates.&lt;ref name=PriceTestimony&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTrials/scottsboro/Exprice.htm |title=Testimony of Virginia Price |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed Norris raped her, along with five others.

Callahan would not allow Leibowitz to ask Price about any "crime of moral turpitude." Nor would he allow Leibowitz to ask why she went to Chattanooga, where she had spent the night there, or about Carter or Gilley. Neither would he allow questions as to whether she'd had sexual intercourse with Carter or Gilley. During more cross-examination, Price looked at Knight so often Leibowitz accused her of looking for signals. Judge Callahan cautioned Leibowitz he would not permit "such tactics" in his courtroom.&lt;ref name=Acker127&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Bridges was a state witness, and Leibowitz cross-examined him at length, trying to get him to agree that a rape would have produced more injuries than he found. Callahan sustained a prosecution objection, ruling "the question is not based on the evidence."&lt;ref name=Acker128&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruby Bates had given a deposition from her hospital bed in New York, which arrived in time to be read to the jury in the Norris trial. Judge Callahan sustained prosecution objections to large portions of it, most significantly the part where she said that she and Price both had sex voluntarily in Chattanooga the night before the alleged rapes.

Leibowitz read the rest of Bates' deposition, including her version of what happened on the train.&lt;ref name=Acker129&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; She said that there were white teenagers riding in the gondola car with them, that some black teenagers came into the car, that a fight broke out, that most of the white teenagers got off the train, and that the blacks "disappeared" until the posse stopped the train at Paint Rock. She testified that she, Price and Gilley were arrested, and that Price made the rape accusation, instructing her to go along with the story to stay out of jail. She reiterated that neither she nor Price had been raped.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibowitz chose to keep Norris off the stand.&lt;ref name=Acker129 /&gt;

Closing arguments were on December 4, 1933. In his closing argument, Leibowitz called the prosecution's case "a contemptible frame-up by two bums."&lt;ref name=Acker131 /&gt; He attempted to overcome local prejudice, saying "if you have a reasonable doubt, hold out. Stand your ground, show you are a man, a red-blooded he-man."&lt;ref name=Acker131&gt;Acker p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution's closing argument was shorter and less "barbed" than it had been in the Patterson case. It was addressed more to the evidence and less to the regional prejudice of the jury.&lt;ref name=Acker131 /&gt;

Leibowitz made many objections to Judge Callahan's charge to the jury. ''The New York Times'' described Leibowitz as "pressing the judge almost as though he were a hostile witness."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', December 5, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; New York City Mayor [[Fiorello H. La Guardia]] had dispatched two burly New York City police officers to protect Leibowitz. During the long jury deliberations, Judge Callahan also assigned two Morgan County deputies to guard him.

The jury began deliberation on December 5. After 14 hours of deliberation, the jury filed into the court room; they returned a guilty verdict and sentenced Norris to death. Norris took the news stoically.

Leibowitz's prompt appeal stayed the execution date, so Patterson and Norris were both returned to death row in Kilby Prison.  The other defendants waited in the [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]] jail in Birmingham for the outcome of the appeals. Leibowitz was escorted to the train station under heavy guard, and he boarded a train back to New York.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Supreme Court reverses Decatur convictions===
{{see also|Patterson v. Alabama}}

[[File:Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes]]
The case went to the United States Supreme Court for a second time as ''Norris v. Alabama.'' The court reversed the convictions for a second time on the basis that blacks had been excluded from the jury pool because of their race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.findlaw.com/us/294/587.html ''Norris v. Alabama'' (1935)], 294 U.S. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorneys Samuel Leibowitz, Walter H. Pollak and Osmond Frankel argued the case from February 15 to 18, 1935. Leibowitz showed the justices that the names of African Americans had been added to the jury rolls. The Justices examined the items closely with a magnifying glass. Thomas Knight maintained that the jury process was color blind.

[[File:BibbGraves.jpg|thumb|Alabama Governor [[Bibb Graves]]]]
Because the case of Haywood Patterson had been dismissed due to the technical failure to appeal it on time, it presented different issues. Attorneys Osmond Frankel and Walter Pollak argued those.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 1935, the United States Supreme Court sent the cases back a second time for retrials in Alabama.
Writing for the Court, Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] observed the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the United States Constitution clearly forbade the states from excluding citizens from juries due solely to their race.&lt;ref&gt;''Norris v. Alabama'' (1935), 294 U.S. 587, 589.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that the Court had inspected the jury rolls, chastising Judge Callahan and the Alabama Supreme Court for accepting assertions that black citizens had not been excluded. According to the U.S. Supreme Court, "something more" was needed. The Court concluded, "the motion to quash ... should have been granted."&lt;ref name="Norris v. Alabama 1935"/&gt;  The Court ruled that it would be a great injustice to execute Patterson when Norris would receive a new trial, reasoning that Alabama should have opportunity to reexamine Patterson's case as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Patterson v. Alabama'' (1935), 294 U.S. 600, 606–607.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama Governor [[Bibb Graves]] instructed every solicitor and judge in the state, "Whether we like the decisions or not... We must put Negroes in jury boxes. Alabama is going to observe the supreme law of America."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], pp. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final round of trials===

After the case was remanded, on May 1, 1935, Victoria Price swore new rape complaints against the defendants as the sole complaining witness. An African American, Creed Conyer, was selected as the first black person since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] to sit on an Alabama grand jury. Indictment could be made with a two-thirds vote, and the grand jury voted to indict the defendants. Thomas Knight, Jr. by now (May 1935) Lieutenant Governor, was appointed special prosecutor to the cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibowitz recognized that he was viewed by Southerners as an outsider, and allowed the local attorney Charles Watts to be the lead attorney; he assisted from the sidelines. Judge Callahan arraigned all the defendants except the two juveniles in Decatur; they all pleaded not guilty.

Watts moved to have the case sent to the Federal Court as a [[civil rights]] case, which Callahan promptly denied. He set the retrials for January 20, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/a_f/boyle/chronology.htm |title=A Scottsboro Chronology |publisher=English.uiuc.edu |accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final decisions===
[[File:Powell, Ozie in Hospital 1-24-36.jpg|thumb|Ozie Powell in hospital]] 
By January 23, 1936 Haywood Patterson was convicted of rape and sentenced to 75 years—the first time in Alabama that a black man had not been sentenced to death in the rape of a white woman.&lt;ref name=UMKC-SB_acct /&gt; Patterson escaped from prison in 1948; he published ''The Scottsboro Boy'' in 1950. That year he was caught by the FBI in Michigan. The governor of the state refused to extradite Patterson to Alabama. He was later arrested for stabbing a man in a bar fight and convicted of manslaughter. Patterson died of cancer in prison in 1952, after serving one year of his second sentence.

On January 24, 1936, Ozie Powell was involved in injuring a deputy.

During May 1937, Thomas Knight died.

On July 15, 1937, Clarence Norris was convicted of rape and sexual assault and sentenced to death. Governor [[Bibb Graves]] of Alabama in 1938 commuted his death sentence to life in prison. He was paroled in 1946 and moved north, where he married and had children. In 1970 he began seeking a pardon, with the help of the [[NAACP]] and Alabama's attorney. In 1976 Governor [[George Wallace]] pardoned Norris, declaring him "not guilty." Norris' autobiography, ''The Last of the Scottsboro Boys'', was published in 1979. Norris died on January 23, 1989, of Alzheimer's disease.

On July 22, 1937, Andrew Wright was convicted of rape and sentenced to 99 years. He was paroled, but returned to prison after violating parole. Finally released in 1950, he was paroled in New York State.

On July 24, 1937, Charlie Weems was convicted of rape and sentenced to 105 years in prison. He was paroled in 1943.

On July 24, 1937, Ozie Powell was brought into court and the new prosecutor, Thomas Lawson, announced that the state was dropping rape charges against Powell and that he was pleading guilty to assaulting a deputy. He was sentenced to 20 years. The state dropped the rape charges as part of this plea bargain.&lt;ref name=LinderBios /&gt; Powell was released from prison in 1946.

On July 24, 1937, the state of Alabama dropped all charges against Willie Roberson, Olen Montgomery, Eugene Williams, and Roy Wright. The four had spent over six years in prison on [[death row]], as "adults" despite their ages. Thomas Lawson announced that all charges were being dropped against the remaining four defendants: He said that after "careful consideration" every prosecutor was "convinced" that Roberson and Montgomery were "not guilty." Wright and Williams, regardless of their guilty or innocence, were 12 and 13 at the time and, in view of the jail time they had already served, justice required that they also be released.

After Alabama freed Roy Wright, the Scottsboro Defense Committee took him on a national lecture tour. He joined the United States Army. Later he married and joined the [[Merchant Marine]]. After Wright came back from a lengthy time at sea in 1959, he thought his wife had been unfaithful. He shot and killed her before turning the gun on himself and committing suicide.&lt;ref name="wrightpbs"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/scottsboro/peopleevents/p_lwright.html "Roy Wright"], ''Scottsboro Boys'', PBS.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 1937, Haywood Patterson was sent to Atmore State Prison Farm. The remaining "Scottsboro Boys" in custody, that of Norris, A Wright and Weems were at this time in Kilby Prison.

===Aftermath===
Governor Graves had planned to pardon the prisoners in 1938, but was angered by their hostility and refusal to admit their guilt. He refused the pardons but did commute Norris' death sentence to life in prison.

Ruby Bates toured for a short while as an ILD speaker. She said she was "sorry for all the trouble that I caused them", and claimed she did it because she was "frightened by the ruling class of Scottsboro." Later, she worked in a New York state spinning factory until 1938; that year she returned to Huntsville. Victoria Price worked in a Huntsville cotton mill until 1938, then moved to [[Flintville, Tennessee]].

''Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South'' (1969) by Dan T. Carter was widely thought to be authoritative, but it wrongly asserted that Price and Bates were dead. An [[NBC]] TV movie, ''Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys'' (1976), asserted that the defense had proven that Price and Bates were [[prostitute]]s; both sued NBC over their portrayals. Bates died in 1976 in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state, where she lived with her carpenter husband, and her case was not heard. Price's case was initially dismissed but she appealed. When the US Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in 1977, Price disregarded the advice of her lawyer and accepted a settlement from NBC. She used the money to buy a house. Price died in 1983, in [[Lincoln County, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montell|first1=William Lynwood|title=Tales from Tennessee Lawyers|date=2005|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813123690| pages=92–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bNbuRnJl8L0C&amp;lpg=PA92|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geis|first1=Gilbert|last2=Bienen|first2=Leigh B|title=Crimes of the Century: From Leopold and Loeb to O.J.

Most residents of Scottsboro have acknowledged the injustice that started in their community.&lt;ref name=Acker2089&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], pp. 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2004, the town dedicated a historical marker in commemoration of the case at the Jackson County Court House.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAcker2007|Acker (2007)]], p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a news story, "An 87-year-old black man who attended the ceremony recalled that the mob scene following the Boys' arrest was frightening and that death threats were leveled against the jailed suspects. Speaking of the decision to install the marker, he said, 'I think it will bring the races closer together, to understand each other better.{{'"}}&lt;ref name=Acker2089 /&gt;

Sheila Washington founded the Scottsboro Boys Museum and Cultural Center in 2010 in Scottsboro.&lt;ref name="huffpost"/&gt; It is located in the former Joyce Chapel United Methodist Church, and is devoted to exploring the case and commemorating the search for justice for its victims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottsboro-multicultural.com/?page_id=11 "About Us"], Scottsboro Boys Museum and Cultural Center website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 pardon===
In early May 2013, the Alabama legislature cleared the path for posthumous pardons.&lt;ref name="huffpost"&gt;{{cite news|title=More work ahead in Ala for Scottsboro Boys pardons|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130504/us-scottsboro-boys-pardon/?ir=green|first=Phillip|last=Rawls|agency=Associated Press|work=The Huffington Post|date=May 4, 2013|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 21, 2013, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles granted posthumous pardons to Weems, Wright and Patterson, the only Scottsboro Boys who had neither had their convictions overturned nor received a pardon.&lt;ref&gt;

Governor [[Robert J. Bentley]] said to the press that day: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;While we could not take back what happened to the Scottsboro Boys 80 years ago, we found a way to make it right moving forward.  The pardons granted to the Scottsboro Boys today are long overdue. The legislation that led to today's pardons was the result of a bipartisan, cooperative effort.

===In popular culture===
'''Literature'''
*African-American poet and playwright [[Langston Hughes]] wrote about the trials in his work ''Scottsboro Limited''.
*The novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' by [[Harper Lee]] is about growing up in the Deep South in the 1930s. An important plot element concerns the father, attorney Atticus Finch, defending a black man against a false accusation of rape. The trial in this novel is often characterized as based on the Scottsboro case. But Harper Lee said in 2005 that she had in mind something less sensational, although the Scottsboro case served "the same purpose" to display Southern prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Charles J. ''Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee'' p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Ellen Feldman]]'s ''Scottsboro: A Novel'' (2009) was shortlisted for the [[Orange Prize]]; it is a fictionalized account of the trial, told from the point of view of Ruby Bates and a fictional journalist, Alice Whittier.
*Richard Wright's 1940 novel ''[[Native Son]]'' (New York: Harper, 1940) was influenced by the Scottsboro Boys case. There is a parallel between the court scene in ''Native Son'' in which Max calls the "hate and impatience" of "the mob congregated upon the streets beyond the window" (Wright 386) and the "mob who surrounded the Scottsboro jail with rope and kerosene" after the Scottsboro boys' initial conviction.

'''''Scène à faire''''' ([[French language|French]] for "scene to be made" or "scene that must be done"; plural:  ''scènes à faire'') is a scene in a book or film which is almost obligatory for a [[genre]] of its type. In the U.S. it also refers to a [[legal principle|principle]] in [[copyright law]] in which certain elements of a [[creative work]] are held to be not protected when they are mandated by or customary to the [[genre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivanhoffman.com/scenes.html Scenes a Faire Under Copyright Law]. – Ivan Hoffman, B.A., J.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in different genres==

For example, a [[spy novel]] is expected to contain elements such as [[Swiss banking|numbered Swiss bank account]]s, a [[femme fatale]], and various spy [[gadget]]s hidden in [[wristwatch]]es, [[belt (clothing)|belt]]s, [[shoe]]s, and other personal effects. The [[United States Court of Appeals]] for the Second Circuit interpreted the ''scènes à faire'' doctrine expansively to hold that a motion picture about the South Bronx would need to feature drunks, prostitutes, vermin, and derelict cars to be perceived as realistic, and therefore a later film that duplicated these features of an earlier film did not infringe.&lt;ref&gt;''Williams v. Crichton'', 84 F.3d 581, 583 (2d Cir. 1996), commenting on ''Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc.'', 784 F.2d 44 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; These elements are not protected by copyright, though specific sequences and compositions of them can be.

As another example, in [[computer programming]], it is often customary to list [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] at the beginning of the [[source code]] of a program.  In some programming languages, it is required to also [[Declaration (computer programming)|declare]] the type of variable at the same time.  Depending on the function of a program, certain types of variables are to be expected.  If a program deals with files, variable types that deal with files are often listed and declared.  As a result, variable declarations are generally not considered protected elements of a program.  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] made this part of the analysis for infringement of non-literal elements of computer code in ''[[Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc.'', 982 F.2d 693 (2d Cir. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;  In that case, the court added it into its [[Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test|Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison]] test.

==Policy==

The policy rationale of the doctrine of ''scènes à faire'' is that granting a first comer exclusivity over ''scènes à faire'' would greatly hinder others in the subsequent creation of other expressive works. That would be against the constitutionally mandated policy of the copyright law to promote progress in the creation of works, and it would be an impediment to the public's enjoyment of such further creative expressions. By the same token, little benefit to society would flow from grants of copyright exclusivity over ''scènes à faire''.&lt;ref name="docs.law.gwu.edu"&gt;See ''Short Tutorial Note on How the Merger Doctrine and Scènes à Faire Differently Address Relevant Market'', in [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/ch4b.htm George Washington Univ. Computer Law].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a business and computer program context, the doctrine of ''scènes à faire'' is interpreted to apply to the practices and demands of the businesses and industries that the given computer program serves. Hence, the concepts of idea vs. expression (merger doctrine) and ''scènes à faire'' relate directly to promoting availability of business functionality.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Engineering Dynamics, Inc. v. Structural Software, Inc.'', 46 F.3d 408, 410 n.2 (5th Cir. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''CMM Cable Rep., Inc. v. Ocean Coast Properties, Inc.'', 97 F.3d 1504 (1st Cir. 1996). the court compared the merger and ''scènes à faire'' doctrines. The court said that the two doctrines were similar in policy, in that they both sought to prevent monopolization of ideas. However, merger applied when idea and expression were inseparable, but ''scènes à faire'' applied despite separability where an external common setting caused use of common elements and thus similarity of expression.&lt;ref&gt;''CCM Cable'', 97 F.3d at 1522 n.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits of doctrine==

The doctrine must be a matter of degree—that is, operate on a continuum. Consider the Second Circuit's ruling that the ''scène à faire'' for a movie about the South Bronx would need to feature drunks, prostitutes, vermin (rats, in the accused and copyrighted works), and derelict cars. The principle must have a limit, however, so that something is outside the ''scènes à faire'' doctrine for South Bronx movies. Perhaps, cockroaches, gangs, and muggings are also part of the South Bronx ''scène à faire'', but further similarity such as the film having as characters "a slumlord with a heart of gold and a policeman who is a Zen Buddhist and lives in a garage" surely goes beyond the South Bronx ''scène à faire''. There must be some expression possible even in a cliche-ridden genre."&lt;ref name="docs.law.gwu.edu"/&gt;

==Cases==
*''[[Cain v. Universal Pictures]]'', 47 F.Supp. 1013 ([[United States District Court for the Southern District of California]] 1942)
::This was the case where the term was introduced, when the writer [[James M. Cain]] sued [[Universal Pictures]], the scriptwriter and the director for copyright infringement in connection with the film ''[[When Tomorrow Comes (film)|When Tomorrow Comes]]''.  Cain claimed a scene in his book where two protagonists take refuge from a storm in a church had been copied in a scene depicting the same situation in the movie. Judge [[Leon Rene Yankwich]]  ruled that there was no resemblance between the scenes in the book and the film other than incidental "scènes à faire", or natural similarities due to the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv |url=https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=5293541731877026047&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qhviT-LHJcPu2gXmuojvCw&amp;ved=0CAgQgAMoADAA

*''Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc.'', 784 F.2d 44 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2d Cir]]. 1986)
::After the release of the film ''[[Fort Apache, The Bronx]]'', author Thomas Walker filed a lawsuit against one of the production companies, Time-Life Television Films (legal owner of the script), claiming that the producers infringed on his book ''Fort Apache'' (New York: Crowell, 1976. {{ISBN|0-690-01047-8}}).  Among other things, Walker, the plaintiff, argued that: "both the book and the film begin with the murder of a black and a white policeman with a handgun at close range; both depict cockfights, drunks, stripped cars, prostitutes and rats; both feature as central characters third- or fourth-generation Irish policemen who live in Queens and frequently drink; both show disgruntled, demoralized police officers and unsuccessful foot chases of fleeing criminals." But the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] ruled that these are stereotypical ideas, and that the [[United States copyright law]] does not protect concepts or ideas. The court ruling stated: ''"the book ''Fort Apache'' and the film ''Fort Apache: The Bronx'' were not substantially similar beyond [the] level of generalized or otherwise nonprotectible ideas, and thus [the] latter did not infringe copyright of [the] former."''&lt;ref name=MargolickD-NYT&gt;Margolick, David. – Legal Notes: "Writer Told 'Ft. Apache' isn't Just His". – ''[[New York Times]]''. – August 25, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beeber, Jessie, and Maura Wogan. – "Is Scènes à Faire Really 'Necessary'?". – ''Entertainment, Arts and Sports Law Journal''. – Spring 2004. – Vol. 15, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Joshua Ets-Hokin v. Skyy Spirits Inc.'', 225 F.3d 1068 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Cir]]. 2000) 
{{Wikisource|Ets-Hokin v. Skyy Spirits Inc.}}
::Another significant case in [[United States law]] was ''Ets-Hokin v. Skyy Spirits'' (2003), in which ''scenes à faire'' was upheld as an [[affirmative defense]] by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]. The case involved a commercial photographer, Joshua Ets-Hokin, who sued [[SKYY vodka]] when another photographer created advertisements with a substantially similar appearance to work he had done for them in the past. It was established that the similarity between his work and the later works of the photographer was largely mandated by the limited range of expression possible; within the constraints of a photo shoot for a commercial product there are only so many ways one may photograph a vodka bottle. In light of this, to establish copyright infringement, the two photos would have been required to be virtually identical. The originality of the later work was established by such minor differences as different shadows and angles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/225_f3d_1068.htm ''Ets-Hokin v.

* ''Gates Rubber Co. v. Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd.'', 9 F.3d 823 (10th Cir. 1993)

::A significant ''scènes à faire'' case in the computer program context is ''Gates v. Bando''. The court explained the policy and application of the doctrine to computer program copyright infringement cases in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
::Under the ''scènes à faire'' doctrine, we deny protection to those expressions that are standard, stock, or common to a particular topic or that necessarily follow from a common theme or setting. Granting copyright protection to the necessary incidents of an idea would effectively afford a monopoly to the first programmer to express those ideas. Furthermore, where a particular expression is common to the treatment of a particular idea, process, or discovery, it is lacking in the originality that is the ''sine qua non'' for copyright protection.

::The ''scènes à faire'' doctrine also excludes from protection those elements of a program that have been dictated by external factors. In the area of computer programs these external factors may include: hardware standards and mechanical specifications, software standards and compatibility requirements, computer manufacturer design standards, target industry practices and demands, and computer industry programming practices. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* ''[[RG Anand v. Deluxe Films|RG Anand v. M/s Deluxe Films]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1734007/|title = RG Anand v. M/s Deluxe|date = |access-date = February 13, 2016|website = Indiankanoon|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;'', AIR 1978 SC 1613''
::The plaintiff was the writer and producer of a play called "''Hum Hindustani''" that was produced in the period of 1953-1955. The play was based on the evils of provincialism. The defendant in 1956 produced a film called "''New Delhi''". One of the themes of the film was provincialism, too. While evaluating whether or not the defendant had infringed the plaintiff's copyright, the Supreme Court of India held:&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no copyright in an idea, subject matter, ''&lt;u&gt;themes&lt;/u&gt;'', plots or historical or legendary facts and violation of the copyright in such cases is confined to the form, manner and arrangement and expression of the idea by the author of the copyright work. (emphasis supplied)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Therefore, the court held that there is a standard way of dealing with the theme of provincialism, and there can be no copyright over that theme. Consequently, a question of infringement does not even arise.

It is a community service and work-based training program.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Labor, ETA, [http://www.doleta.gov/seniors/html_docs/AboutSCSEP.cfm "About SCSEP"]&lt;/ref&gt; It does this through job skill training and employment assistance with an emphasis on getting a ready job with a suitable and cooperating company or organisation. In such a setting, the worker is paid the [[Minimum wage in the United States|United States minimum wage]], or the highest of Federal, State or local minimum wage, or the prevailing wage, for an average of 20 hours per week, and experiences on-the-job learning and newly acquired skills use. The intention is that through these community jobs, the older worker will gain a permanent job, not subsidized by federal government funds.

People who are 55 or older can obtain job training and job search services from SCSEP. In each area of the country, SCSEP services are accessed through local organizations. These are usually nonprofits, but sometimes a state agency will administer the program.

== Eligibility guidelines ==
The participant must be at least 55 years of age and from a family receiving regular cash welfare payments or with an annual family income of no more than 25% over the [[Poverty in the United States|Federal poverty level]] as defined by the [[United States Census Bureau]]. There are certain exclusions in the income calculation, such as [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] (SSDI).&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Labor, ETA, [http://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/TEGL/TEGL12-06_508.pdf "Training and Employment Guidance Letter No. 12-06], December 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrollment priority is given to persons over age 60, veterans, and qualified spouses of veterans. Preference is given to minority, limited English-speaking, and Indian eligible individuals. Preference is also given to eligible individuals who have the greatest economic need.

== History ==
SCSEP was authorised by the [[United States Congress]] in Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 &lt;ref&gt;[[United States Code]], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3056- US Code Section 42 , Chapter 35, Subchapter IX, § 3056] - Older American Community Service Employment Program&lt;/ref&gt; and its later amendments &lt;ref&gt;United States Public Law, [http://www.doleta.gov/Seniors/other_docs/owp-106-501.pdf Amended Public Law for Title V] Public Law 106–501—NOV. 13, 2000 114 STAT. 2267, Title V—Amendment to Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965, Section 501.&lt;/ref&gt; to provide subsidized, part-time, community [[Public service|service]] work based training for low-income persons age 55 or older who have poor employment prospects. The program has evolved significantly in the last 50 years.  The program is administered by nonprofit organizations and local government agencies.

== Controversy ==
Experience Works, Inc., was historically the largest provider of SCSEP services.  In 2015, the grantee was cited for $1.6 million dollars in questioned costs by the Department of Labor. The report details the use of unrestricted and accrued annual leave to cover a $1.6 million grant overspend, which $1.4 million was used to pay participant wages and fringe benefits, the misuse of federal funds to cover activities including first-class travel, pet hotels, fruit bouquets, personal loans to the CEO, and frequent credit card use on entertainment and prohibited lobbying. The number now totals approximately $2 million in questioned expenses.   &lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Department of Labor, Monitoring Report, December 18, 2015]]. [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4wFqjuHcI_1X1FtMmpEUnEwRHM]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a follow up report critical of current management for not taking any corrective actions to restore funds.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Department of Labor, Report to Sally A. Boofer, 2016]]. [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4wFqjuHcI_1cFZaTldJTnc3OW8]&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the prior management's actions, the U.S. Department of Labor has revamped the funding for SCSEP and the Inspector General has expanded the investigation into the activities of the previous management.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration]]. [https://www.doleta.gov/grants/pdf/FOA-ETA-16-04-A.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal investigation is aided by a whistleblower and other former employees. In September, 2016 the Inspector General issued a preliminary report describing the organization as financial insolvent and took steps to curtail and eliminate federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Office of Inspector General, September 30, 2016]]  [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4wFqjuHcI_1UlVSdkRGVGdCbUU]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, more than 100 employees were terminated as a result of the funding reduction and were paid only part of their accrued leave.

== Funding ==
SCSEP has received stable funding of $434,371,000 during the last several years.  The Trump administration has called for the elimination of the program, which is meeting some resistance in Congress.

The most recent budget proposal from the White House would eliminate the program entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/documents/general/budget/2016/CBJ-2016-V1-06.pdf U.S. Department of Labor]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of February 26, 2012, in [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]], [[Florida]], United States, [[George Zimmerman]] fatally shot [[Trayvon Martin]], a 17-year-old [[African American]] high school student.

Zimmerman, injured during the encounter, claimed self-defense in the confrontation.

In a widely reported trial, Zimmerman was charged with murder for Martin's death, but acquitted at trial on self-defense grounds. The incident was reviewed by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] for potential civil rights violations, but no additional charges were filed, citing insufficient evidence.

===Sanford Police Department===
Bill Lee had been chief of the [[Sanford Police Department (Florida)|Sanford Police Department]] for ten months when the shooting of Martin occurred.&lt;ref name="sentinel-chief"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-03-22/news/os-trayvon-martin-sanford-chief-20120322_1_chief-bill-lee-miami-teenager-investigation|title=Trayvon Martin case: Sanford Police Chief under fire in Trayvon Martin shooting case|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|accessdate=March 23, 2012 |date=March 22, 2012 |first1=Rene |last1=Stutzman |first2=Jeff |last2=Weiner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Lee's becoming chief, the department had been accused of protecting relatives of police officers involved in violent incidents with blacks. The Martin case resulted in increased distrust between the police and Sanford's black community.&lt;ref name="Caller" /&gt;

On March 22, Chief Lee [[leave of absence|temporarily stepped down]] from his position because of public criticism over his handling of the Trayvon Martin shooting.&lt;ref name="sentinel-chief" /&gt; In April, the Sanford City Commission refused to accept Lee's resignation and stated that "Lee's spotless record showed there needed to be further review to determine if he failed in his duties." Lee was fired on June 20, 2012, by Sanford City Manager Norton Bonaparte.&lt;ref name="LeeFiredHerald"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/06/20/2860209/sanford-police-chief-bill-lee.html|title=Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee fired in wake of Trayvon Martin case|last=Rutland|first=Meredith|date=June 20, 2012|work=Miami Herald|accessdate=June 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee responded by saying, "I continue to stand by the work performed by the Sanford Police Department in this tragic shooting, which has been plagued by misrepresentations and false statements for interests other than justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.myfoxorlando.com/story/18839930/sanford-police-chief-bill-lee-fired |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622041618/http://www.myfoxorlando.com/story/18839930/sanford-police-chief-bill-lee-fired |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 22, 2012 |title=Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee fired|publisher=[[WOFL]] |date=June 20, 2012|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2012, the lead investigator of the case, Christopher Serino, was transferred from the Sanford Police Department's investigative unit and reassigned to the patrol division at his own request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lead investigator in Trayvon Martin case transferred out of investigative unit|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/local/lead-investigator-trayvon-martin-case-transferred-/288025893|publisher=WFTV Channel 9 Orlando |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serino said he felt pressured by several of his fellow police officers to press charges against Zimmerman, although he believed there was not enough evidence to do so. One of the officers pressuring him was a friend of Martin's father.&lt;ref name="martins cousin2"/&gt;

In September 2012, Orlando TV station [[WFTV]] released a leaked memo in which interim police chief Richard Myers blamed the police department spokesperson, Sgt. David Morgenstern, for having mishandled the Travyon Martin case. Myers removed Morgenstern from that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Memo: Sanford police chief blames spokesman for mishandling Trayvon Martin case|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/news/wftv-obtained-memo-interim-police-chief-blames-dep/nR5HZ/|publisher=WFTV Channel 9 Orlando |date=September 6, 2012 |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 1, 2011, through February 26, 2012, police were called to The Retreat at Twin Lakes 402 times.&lt;ref name="Caller"/&gt; Crimes committed at The Retreat in the year prior to Martin's death had included eight burglaries, nine thefts, and one shooting.&lt;ref name="dailybeast 911 calls"&gt;{{cite web|last=DeLuca|first=Matthew|title=Did Trayvon shooter abuse 911|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/23/did-trayvon-shooter-abuse-911.html |publisher=The Daily Beast |accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twin Lakes residents said there were dozens of reports of attempted break-ins, which had created an atmosphere of fear in their neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Reuters prelude"/&gt;

In September 2011, the Twin Lakes residents held an organizational meeting to create a neighborhood watch program. Zimmerman was selected by neighbors as the program's coordinator, according to Wendy Dorival, Neighborhood Watch organizer for the Sanford Police Department.&lt;ref name="designated watch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunrules"&gt;{{cite news |last=Jacobson|first=Susan|title=Trayvon Martin: Trayvon Martin shooter George Zimmerman broke neighborhood watch gun rules|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-03-24/news/os-trayvon-martin-neighborhood-watch-20120321_1_zimmerman-community-ties-neighborhood-watch|work=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimmerman had made nearly 50 calls to police between 2004 and 2012 to report various local disturbances, such as loud parties, open garage doors, potholes, and children playing in the street.&lt;ref name="Caller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailybeast 911 calls"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weinstein|first=Adam|title=Trayvon shooter's 911 calls: potholes, piles of trash -- and black men|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/03/trayvon-shooters-911-calls-potholes-piles-trash-black-men|newspaper=Mother Jones|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following break-ins in the neighborhood in 2011, Zimmerman's calls to police increasingly focused on reporting people he suspected of criminal activity.&lt;ref name="TBT 25March"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailybeast 911 calls"/&gt;

During the months leading up to the February 26, 2012, shooting, Zimmerman called the police several times to report people he believed to be suspicious. On each of the calls, Zimmerman offered information about the race of the suspects only when specifically asked by the dispatcher to do so; his reports said that all were black males.&lt;ref name=portraiture&gt;{{cite news|last=Faussett|first=Richard|title=Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman: a portrait of the Retreat|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/18/nation/la-na-nn-zimmerman-hoa-newsletters-20120518|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hightower|first=Kyle|last2=Schneider|first2=Mike|title=Judge in Trayvon Martin case weighs police calls|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/prosecutors-want-admit-calls-zimmerman-trial|publisher=Associated Press|date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbc 7 calls"&gt;{{cite news|last=Isikoff|first=Michael|title=In police calls, Zimmerman mentioned race only when asked|url=http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/05/11045284-in-police-calls-zimmerman-mentioned-race-only-when-asked?lite|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=June 28, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508032605/http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/05/11045284-in-police-calls-zimmerman-mentioned-race-only-when-asked?lite|archivedate=May 8, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|[http://www.wagist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/911CallHistory.pdf Police Event Reports for calls made by Zimmerman (911 and non-emergency)]|group="Note"}}

According to friends and neighbors of Zimmerman, three weeks prior to the shooting on February 2, Zimmerman called police to report a young man peering into the windows of an empty Twin Lakes home.&lt;ref name="Reuters prelude"/&gt; By the time police arrived, the suspect had fled. On February 6, workers witnessed two young black men lingering in the yard of a Twin Lakes resident around the same time a new laptop and some gold jewelry was stolen from her home. The next day police discovered the stolen laptop in the backpack of a young black man whom Zimmerman identified as the same person he had spotted peering into windows on February 2.&lt;ref name="Reuters prelude"/&gt;

Zimmerman had been licensed to carry a firearm since November 2009.&lt;ref name="Reuters prelude" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caller" /&gt;

===Zimmerman arrested and released===
Sanford Police Officer Timothy Smith arrived at the scene at approximately 7:17&amp;nbsp;p.m., between 5 and 65 seconds after the fatal shot was fired. He reported finding Zimmerman standing near Martin, who was lying face down in the grass and unresponsive.&lt;ref name="Shooting initial report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanford Police Initial Report|url=http://www.wagist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Twin-Lakes-Shooting-Initial-Report.pdf|date=February 26, 2012|publisher=wagist.com|accessdate=April 7, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IDic8eqB?url=http://www.wagist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Twin-Lakes-Shooting-Initial-Report.pdf|archivedate=July 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeline of events"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gutman|first=Matt|title=Trayvon Martin Case: Timeline of Events|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/05/trayvon-martin-case-timeline-of-events/|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=May 21, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505110815/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/05/trayvon-martin-case-timeline-of-events/|archivedate=May 5, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Zimmerman stated to Smith that he had shot Martin and was still armed. Smith handcuffed Zimmerman and confiscated his black [[Kel-Tec PF-9]] [[9×19mm|9mm]] semi-automatic pistol. Smith observed that Zimmerman's back was wet and covered with grass, and he was bleeding from the nose and the back of his head.&lt;ref name="Shooting initial report" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bleeding from the nose, paramedics"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stutzman|first=Rene|title=Trayvon Martin; Zimmerman Account|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-03-26/news/os-trayvon-martin-zimmerman-account-20120326_1_miami-schools-punch-unarmed-black-teenager|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricardo Ayala, the second officer to arrive that night, noticed Officer Smith had Zimmerman in custody, then observed Martin lying face down in the grass and attempted to get a response from him.

On the night of the shooting, Zimmerman was taken in for questioning. He arrived to the police station at 7:52&amp;nbsp;p.m., according to a police video.&lt;ref name="what is known" /&gt; Zimmerman was interviewed by Investigator D.

Five hours later, Zimmerman was released.

The day after the shooting, Zimmerman performed a videotaped reenactment of the incident for police.&lt;ref name="Kovaleski"/&gt;

Some observers, such as University of Florida law professor and defense attorney Michelle Jacobs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alcindor|first=Yamiche|title=Trayvon Martin's killing now a murder case|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-04-12/george-zimmerman-charges-trayvon-martin-shooting/54191768/1|newspaper=USA Today|date=April 12, 2012|author2=Bello, Marisol|author3=Welch, William M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Columbia University law professor Patricia Williams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Patricia J.|title=The real injustice at the heart of the Trayvon Martin case: what makes this case exceptional is neither race nor the politics of self-defense alone but the total failure to investigate it for so long|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/167455/real-injustice-heart-trayvon-martin-case|newspaper=The Nation|date=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that the police failed to fully investigate the shooting when they did not test Zimmerman for drugs or alcohol intoxication. However, Miami, Florida police experts told the ''Miami Herald'' that homicide suspects are not typically tested for drugs or alcohol unless the suspect has been accused of having been driving while intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robles|first=Frances|title=A look at what happened the night Trayvon Martin died|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/a-look-at-what-happened-the-night-trayvon-martin-died/1223083|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martin's body identified===
Martin's body was taken to the [[morgue]], where he was tagged as a [[John Doe]], as he was not carrying any identification.&lt;ref name="dtrotta01"/&gt; The mobile phone found at the shooting scene was malfunctioning to the point that the police [[Cellebrite]] data recovery device could not access it.&lt;ref name=MSNBC&gt;Serino, Christopher (February 26, 2012).

The Martin family alleged that Seminole County Attorney Wolfinger met personally with Sanford Chief Lee on the night of the shooting and instructed Lee not to make an arrest. Based on their accusation, the Martin family requested that the Justice Department investigate the State prosecutor's office. Wolfinger responded that the family's accusations were "outright lies" and denied that any such meeting or communication took place. Wolfinger's office reported that the Sanford police consulted with Kelly Jo Hines, the prosecutor on call the night of the shooting, but it has not been disclosed what was talked about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/02/us-usa-florida-shooting-prosecutor-idUSBRE83116420120402|author1=Trotta, Daniel|author2=Liston, Barbara|title=Prosecutor denies interfering in Florida shooting case|agency=Reuters|date=April 2, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State Attorney's investigation===
On March 12, 2012, Police Chief Lee turned the investigation over to the State Attorney's office for review.&lt;ref name="Chief Lee"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/03/12/2690445/sanford-chief-no-charges-yet-in.html|title=Sanford chief: Shooting death of Miami teen turned over to state attorney|work=Miami Herald|date=March 12, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320034612/http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/03/12/2690445/sanford-chief-no-charges-yet-in.html|archivedate=March 20, 2012}} Link only works with [[Javascript]] disabled&lt;/ref&gt; Lee said there was not enough evidence to arrest Zimmerman. "In this case Mr. Zimmerman has made the statement of self-defense," Lee said. "Until we can establish probable cause to dispute that, we don't have the grounds to arrest him." In response to criticisms of the investigation, Lee responded that "We are taking a beating over this" and defended the investigation.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/19/us-crime-florida-idUSBRE82I01920120319|title=FBI monitoring fatal Florida shooting case, as police criticized|last1=Adams|first1=David|last2=Brown|first2=Tom| last3=Pelofsky|first3=Jeremy|date=March 18, 2012|agency=Reuters|accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This is all very unsettling.

I'm sure Trayvon would, too."&lt;ref name="Caller" /&gt;{{by whom|date=January 2016}}

On March 13, 2012, Chris Serino sent a ''[[capias]]'' request to the state's attorney recommending charges of [[manslaughter|negligent manslaughter]] against Zimmerman, though Serino maintains he did not believe they had the evidence to support those charges and that manslaughter was only included in the ''capias'' in order for the prosecutor's office to continue with their own investigation.&lt;ref name="CNN avoidable" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stutzman |first=Rene |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-07-07/news/os-george-zimmerman-sanford-police-lied-20120707_1_special-prosecutor-angela-corey-chief-bill-lee-arrest-warrant |title=George Zimmerman arrest Sanford: Police gave mixed messages about George Zimmerman's arrest |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=July 7, 2012 |accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpo-justice"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/martin-familys-attorney-seeks-justice-dept-investigation-into-police-actions-after-shooting/2012/04/02/gIQAnD2prS_singlePage.html| title=Martin family's attorney seeks Justice Dept. investigation into police actions after shooting| last=Horwitz|first=Sari|author2=White, Josh |date=April 2, 2012|work=The Washington Post | accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes march 13 capias"&gt;{{cite news|title=Documents shed more light on Trayvon Martin shooting|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/18/nation/la-na-trayvon-martin-20120518|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 21, 2012|first1=Richard|last1=Fausset|first2=Michael|last2=Muskal|first3=Molly|last3=Hennessy-Fiske|date=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''capias'' states, "the encounter between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin was ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman, if Zimmerman had remained in his vehicle and waited the arrival of law enforcement or conversely if he had identified himself to Martin as a concerned citizen and initiated dialog in an effort to dispel each party's concern....

On March 16, Serino told the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' that his investigation had turned up no reliable evidence that cast doubt on Zimmerman's account; that he had acted in self-defense.

On March 20, 2012, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] announced that it was opening investigations into the incident.&lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/19/justice/florida-teen-shooting|title=Justice Department, FBI to probe Florida teen's death|date=March 20, 2012|publisher=CNN|accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI opened a parallel investigation into whether Martin's [[civil rights]] were violated, interviewed witnesses, and looked into Zimmerman's background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/02/10983757-fbi-questions-people-in-trayvon-martin-case-begins-parallel-investigation |title=FBI questions people in Trayvon Martin case, begins 'parallel investigation' |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |accessdate=April 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404030829/http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/02/10983757-fbi-questions-people-in-trayvon-martin-case-begins-parallel-investigation |archivedate=April 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2012, reports of some of the more than 30 interviews conducted by the FBI were released by Special Prosecutor Angela Corey to Zimmerman's attorney, who released them to the public. The released reports do not draw any conclusions in the DOJ investigation.&lt;ref name="cnn no racist"/&gt; The Sanford Police Department's lead investigator, Chris Serino, told FBI agents that he believed Zimmerman's actions were not based on Martin's race, but instead on Martin's attire, the circumstances of the encounter, and previous burglaries in the neighborhood. Zimmerman's neighbors and co-workers were interviewed as well. Neighbors who knew Zimmerman had nothing derogatory to say about him and his co-workers were complimentary of him.&lt;ref name="cnn no racist"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hayes|first=Ashley|title=Witnesses tell FBI that George Zimmerman is no racist|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/12/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=July 13, 2012|date=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serino also told the FBI that he had felt pressure from three officers within the department to charge Zimmerman although he "did not believe he had enough evidence at the time to file charges", and accused one of these officers of being friendly with Martin's father. He also expressed concern to the FBI about possible leaks of evidence to the media from within the department.&lt;ref name="martins cousin2"/&gt;

On July 13, 2013, shortly after the trial verdict, the U.S. Justice Department issued a statement saying its investigation into the civil rights aspects of the case was continuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Effron|first=Lauren|title=George Zimmerman Could Face Civil Suits, Death Threats, Federal Prosecution|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmerman-face-civil-suits-death-threats-federal/story?id=19661599|publisher=ABC News|date=July 14, 2013|accessdate=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24, 2015, 35 months after it began, the civil rights investigation of the Justice Department was terminated for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; The FBI investigation was concurrently terminated for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-officials-close-investigation-death-trayvon-martin |title=Federal Officials Close Investigation Into Death of Trayvon Martin &amp;#124; OPA &amp;#124; Department of Justice |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |date=2015-02-24 |accessdate=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===County medical examiner's autopsy report===

On March 29, 2012, an eyewitness, referred to as a male, said that he saw two men on the ground scuffling, then heard the shooting and saw Zimmerman walk away with no blood on him.&lt;ref&gt;Luscombe, Richard (March 30, 2012).

She pointed out that she heard an argument between a younger and an older voice. During the time that she witnessed the incident, the scuffling happened on the grass. She said that the larger man, who walked away after the gunshot, was on top and that it was too dark to see blood on his face.&lt;ref&gt;(April 7, 2012).

A witness who arrived shortly after the shooting revealed photos that he took that night that showed "blood trickling down the back of Zimmerman's head from two cuts. It also shows a possible contusion forming on the crown of his head". In revealing the photo to [[ABC News]] in mid-April, he noted that he had heard but had not seen the scuffle, had been the first to arrive, and had been the first to talk to Zimmerman after the shooting.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman_back_head"&gt;[http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/ht_george_zimmerman_head_dm_120419_ssh.jpg Photo of blood on back of Zimmerman's head] from: {{cite news | url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmerman-tells-trayvon-martins-parents/story?id=16177849#.T5MNSkZ3yHK | title = George Zimmerman Tells Trayvon Martin's Parents 'I Am Sorry{{'-}} | accessdate = April 21, 2012 | last = Gutman | first = Matt |author2=Seni Tienabeso | date = April 20, 2012 | work = Good Morning America | publisher = ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One eyewitness statement given the night of the shooting describes "a black male, wearing a dark colored 'hoodie' on top of a white or Hispanic male who was yelling for help."

Zimmerman said he was driving to the grocery store when he spotted Trayvon Martin walking through the neighborhood. Zimmerman's father said that, while his son was not on duty that night as Neighborhood Watch captain, there had been many break-ins and he thought it suspicious that someone he did not recognize was walking behind the town homes instead of on the street or the sidewalk. Zimmerman therefore called a non-emergency police line to report Martin's behavior and summon police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myfoxorlando.com/story/17376796/exclusive-robert-zimmerman-interview|author=Boey, Valerie|title=Exclusive: Robert Zimmerman interview|accessdate=July 11, 2013|publisher=WOFL (Fox 35 Orlando)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604135144/http://www.myfoxorlando.com/story/17376796/exclusive-robert-zimmerman-interview#|archive-date=June 4, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}} Note: Some of the information is from the video, not the text.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc29mar"&gt;{{cite news | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title = George Zimmerman's dad says Travyon told his son, 'You're gonna die now' | date = March 29, 2012 | publisher = MSNBC | url = http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/29/10912176-george-zimmermans-dad-says-travyon-told-his-son-youre-gonna-die-now?lite | accessdate = May 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413192224/http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/03/29/10912176-george-zimmermans-dad-says-travyon-told-his-son-youre-gonna-die-now?lite |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the call, Zimmerman told the dispatcher that Martin was "coming to check me out."&lt;ref name="motherjones transcript" /&gt; A source to the ''Orlando Sentinel'' said in May that Zimmerman told investigators that at one point Martin circled his vehicle,{{#tag:ref| An ''Orlando Sentinel'' source reported in May 2012 that Zimmerman told investigators that Martin "was circling" his vehicle at one point, but news stories after Zimmerman's statements to police were released reported that he said Martin "circled" his vehicle.|group = "Note"}} and he rolled up his window to avoid a confrontation.&lt;ref name="circles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="discovery 2 USAToday" /&gt;

In the interviews, Zimmerman says he took note of Martin because he was near a home that he had previously called police about. He also said "he was just walking casually, not like he was trying to get out of the rain" and he felt "something was off" about Martin.&lt;ref name="discovery 2 USAToday"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-06-21/zimmerman-version-of-trayvon-martin-shooting/55748014/1|title=Zimmerman defense releases tapes of his shooting account|last=Bello|first=Marisol|work=USA Today|date=June 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a reconstruction video-recorded by police the next day, Zimmerman said that after he initially saw Martin on Retreat View Circle he parked his vehicle in front of the club house at the corner of Retreat View Circle and Twin Trees Lane and observed Martin go past him and onto Twin Trees Lane where he lost sight of Martin. He stated the dispatcher asked "can you get to somewhere where you can see him?" and that he then left the club house parking lot and drove onto Twin Trees Lane where he parked. He further stated that at one point Martin circled his truck while he was parked on Twin Trees Lane.&lt;ref name="wftv.com"&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=http://www.wftv.com/videos/news/raw-george-zimmerman-reenacts-trayvon-martin/vcQxd/ |title=Raw: George Zimmerman reenacts Trayvon Martin shooting |publisher=WFTV |date=2012-06-21 |accessdate=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Shooting of Trayvon Martin map.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Shooting of Trayvon Martin map]] Zimmerman eventually left his truck and walked down the sidewalk between Twin Trees Lane to Retreat View Circle and gave police an address on Retreat View Circle.&lt;ref name="wftv.com"/&gt; He told investigators that he was not following Martin but was "just going in the same direction he was" to find an address, but admitted that he had also left his truck to try to see in which direction Martin had gone.&lt;ref name="GZ statements McC" /&gt; The altercation began, he said, when Martin suddenly appeared while Zimmerman was walking back to his vehicle.

Zimmerman was offered three chances to be taken to the hospital, but declined each time, according to police reports released by the prosecution.&lt;ref name="nyt discovery" /&gt; ABC News reported that a medical report compiled by Zimmerman's family physician showed that, following the altercation with Martin, Zimmerman was diagnosed with a [[closed fracture]] of his nose, two [[black eye]]s, [[laceration]]s to the back of his head, a minor back injury, and bruising in his upper lip and cheek.&lt;ref name="ABC MEDICAL REPORT"&gt;{{cite news |title=ABC News Exclusive: Zimmerman Medical Report Shows Broken Nose, Lacerations After Trayvon Martin Shooting|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmerman-medical-report-sheds-light-injuries-trayvon/story?id=16353532|work=ABC World News|publisher=Yahoo! – ABC News Network|accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of Zimmerman's recorded interviews, Detective Chris Serino questioned aspects of Zimmerman's account, such as Zimmerman's statement that he didn't know the name of a street in the Twin Lakes community where he had lived for three years. Zimmerman said in response that he had a bad memory and takes medication for [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].&lt;ref name="discovery 2 USAToday" /&gt; Investigators also questioned the extent of his injuries and why he didn't identify himself to Martin as a Neighborhood Watch coordinator.

====Zimmerman's first media interview====
On July 18, 2012, Zimmerman, accompanied by his attorney [[Mark O'Mara]], gave his first long media interview to [[Sean Hannity]], and part of the interview appeared on ''[[Hannity]]'' that evening. During the interview, Zimmerman said that he did not regret his actions on the night of the shooting and that he felt that what had happened "was all God's plan".&lt;ref name="First interview MH" /&gt; He also said, "I do wish there was something, anything I could have done that wouldn't have put me in the position where I had to take his life. I want to tell everyone, my wife, my family, my parents, grandmother, the Martins, the city of Sanford and America: I'm sorry that this happened. I'm truly sorry."&lt;ref name="Hannity interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="First interview MH" /&gt;

When Hannity asked Zimmerman why his suspicions were aroused when he noticed Martin, Zimmerman replied in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I felt he was suspicious because it was raining. He was in-between houses, cutting in-between houses, and he was walking very leisurely for the weather.... It didn't look like he was a resident that went to check their mail and got caught in the rain and was hurrying back home. He didn't look like a fitness fanatic that would train in the rain.&lt;ref name="thegrio.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Joy-Ann Reid |url=http://thegrio.com/2012/07/18/zimmerman-says-he-was-not-pursuing-trayvon-martin/ |title=Zimmerman tells Hannity: 'No regrets' over his actions in Trayvon Martin shooting |publisher=The Grio |date=July 18, 2012 |accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="video.foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/1741879195001/ | publisher=Fox News Channel | title=Exclusive: George Zimmerman breaks silence on 'Hannity{{'-}} | date=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the interview with Hannity, Special Prosecutor Angela Corey filed formal notice that she intended to use the interview as evidence against Zimmerman.&lt;ref name="interview against"&gt;{{cite news|title=Special prosecutor will use George Zimmerman's Fox News interview against him|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-07-19/news/os-george-zimmerman-interview-react-20120719_1_trayvon-martin-special-prosecutor-angela-corey-george-zimmerman|first=Rene|last=Stutzman|first2=Jeff|last2=Weiner|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=July 19, 2012|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article in the ''Orlando Sentinel'', Zimmerman's story differed in at least two details from previous versions of what he said happened the night he shot Martin—specifically, that he told Hannity he had walked toward Martin because he was trying to find a street address to provide the police, but during the police's investigation he had said that the reason he approached Martin was that he was looking for the name of the street, which he had forgotten; and that he told Hannity that Martin had been "skipping, going away quickly", not running away out of fear, but he had previously told Sanford police that Martin had run away as Zimmerman was reporting him.&lt;ref name="interview against" /&gt;

Florida defense lawyers said it was a mistake for Zimmerman to do a television interview and discuss what happened that night. One of them said, "It's really baffling what he thought he'd gain from it. I question who's in charge of the defense strategy, Zimmerman or O'Mara".&lt;ref name="interview against" /&gt; O'Mara told reporters that the interview was intended to help increase the number of donations to Zimmerman's nearly exhausted legal defense fund, which would pay the costs for Zimmerman's legal defense as well as for shelter and security.&lt;ref name="interview against" /&gt;&lt;ref name=hannityfunds&gt;{{cite news|title=Zimmerman interview part of plan to promote website, raise more defense funds|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/news/local/zimmerman-interview-part-plan-raise-more-defense-f/nPygj/|publisher=WFTV 9|date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Mara said that Zimmerman had promised Hannity three months earlier that he would give his first interview to Hannity,&lt;ref name="interview against" /&gt; and that Hannity had agreed to promote Zimmerman's website during the interview, although he said Hannity did not.&lt;ref name=hannityfunds/&gt; ABC News' [[Barbara Walters]] also said that Zimmerman was in desperate need of money and was worried about the safety of his family.&lt;ref name=walters&gt;{{cite news|last=Robles|first=Frances|title=More twists as Zimmerman takes his case public|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/07/19/v-fullstory/2902578/zimmerman-calls-barbara-walter.html|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=July 19, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235646/http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/07/19/v-fullstory/2902578/zimmerman-calls-barbara-walter.html|archivedate=December 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had flown from New York to Florida to record a television interview with Zimmerman that was to be shown following the Hannity interview, but the television network refused to meet Zimmerman's request that they pay for a month's hotel stay and security for his wife.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

===Affidavit of probable cause===
On April 11, 2012, an affidavit of probable cause was filed in support of second-degree murder charges against Zimmerman. The affidavit described what investigators alleged took place between Zimmerman and Martin on the night of the shooting.&lt;ref name="NY Times APC"&gt;{{cite news|title=State of Florida vs. George Zimmerman: Affidavit of probable cause|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/12/us/13shooter-document.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 11, 2012|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herr hearing"&gt;{{cite news|title=George Zimmerman charged|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-04-12/news/os-trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman-charged-jail-20120412_1_face-murder-charges-today-show-accident|work=Orlando Sentinel|date = April 12, 2012|first=Rene|last=Stutzman|first2=Arelis R.|last2=Hernandez|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN court"&gt;{{cite news|title=Affidavit says Zimmerman profiled Martin|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-04-12/justice/justice_florida-teen-shooting_1_police-dispatcher-affidavit-gated-community?_s=PM:JUSTICE|publisher=CNN|accessdate=May 11, 2012|date=March 27, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717224807/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-04-12/justice/justice_florida-teen-shooting_1_police-dispatcher-affidavit-gated-community?_s=PM:JUSTICE|archivedate=July 17, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times court"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alvarez Lizette|first=Kovaleski Serge|title=A Day in Court and a New Lawyer for Defendant in Martin Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/us/george-zimmerman-to-appear-in-court.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 11, 2012|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR court"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dade|first=Corey|title=Affidavit reveals new details in case against George Zimmerman|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/04/12/150525253/affidavit-reveals-new-details-in-case-against-george-zimmerman|publisher=NPR|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors alleged that Zimmerman profiled Martin as he was walking back from a nearby 7-Eleven store to the townhouse where he was temporarily living.&lt;ref name="NY Times APC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN court"/&gt; Prosecutors said Zimmerman was driving in his vehicle when he saw Martin and assumed he was a criminal and perceived that Martin was acting suspicious and felt that he did not belong in the gated community. Zimmerman called the police, and prosecutors said the dispatcher told Zimmerman an officer was on the way and to wait for him. In the call, Zimmerman made reference to people he felt had gotten away with break-ins in the neighborhood.{{#tag:ref|While talking about Martin, Zimmerman stated "these assholes, they always get away" and also said "these fucking punks.&lt;ref name="NY Times APC"/&gt;|group="Note"}}&lt;ref name="NY Times APC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN court"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR court"/&gt;

Investigators alleged that while Zimmerman was talking to the dispatcher, Martin was on the phone with a friend and she said that Martin was scared because he was being followed by an unknown man.&lt;ref name="CNN court" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR court" /&gt; Investigators said that Martin attempted to run home, but Zimmerman followed him because he didn't want Martin to get away. When the police dispatcher realized Zimmerman was following Martin, he told Zimmerman that was unnecessary and that police would meet him there. Prosecutors alleged that Zimmerman ignored the dispatcher and continued following Martin and confronted him and a struggle ensued. When police arrived at the scene, Zimmerman admitted to shooting Martin in the chest.&lt;ref name="NY Times APC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herr hearing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN court"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times court"/&gt;

====Analysis of charges====
Legal analysts criticized the prosecution for over-charging Zimmerman, claiming that the probable cause affidavit did not support a charge of second-degree murder.&lt;ref name="criticism"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dershowitz: Prosecutor in Trayvon Martin case overreached with murder charge|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/04/25/dershowitz-trayvon-prosecutor-overreached-with-murder-charge/?test=latestnews|publisher=Fox News Channel|author=Wilson, Greg|date=April 25, 2012|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Second-degree murder charge may be hard to prove in Trayvon Martin case|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/04/11/2743404/second-degree-murder-charge-may.html|work=Miami Herald |author=Hiassen, Scott|author2=Ovalle, David|date=April 12, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/second-degree-murder-charge-may-be-hard-to-prove-i/nN26Z/|archivedate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz claimed the affidavit may have been perjurious if Special Prosecutor [[Angela Corey]] knowingly omitted facts favorable to Zimmerman's self-defense claim.&lt;ref name="criticism" /&gt;

Richard Kuritz, a former prosecutor who worked with Angela Corey, said the state attorney had no obligation to include exculpatory evidence in the affidavit. He stated that Dershowitz could face [[civil action]] for making accusations that Corey committed a crime. "To suggest that she's committing any crime, Dershowitz is way off on that", Kuritz said.&lt;ref name="kuritz dershowitz wrong"&gt;{{cite news|last=Broward|first=Charles|title=Angela Corey takes on well known legal commentator, Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/crime/2012-06-07/story/angela-corey-takes-well-known-legal-commentator-harvard-professor-alan#ixzz1xDH6Ib4z|work=The Florida Times Union|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background yells for help in 9-1-1 calls===
In recordings of the [[9-1-1]] calls, yells for help are audible in the background. Zimmerman's family says it was Zimmerman yelling for help, Martin's family says it was Martin yelling for help, and independent audio analysts offer differing opinions as to who was yelling for help. During the trial, friends and family members of both Zimmerman and Martin testified as to who they thought the voice was, but expert testimony regarding voice identification was not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;State of Florida v. George Zimmerman, No. 12-CF-1083-A (Seminole County 18th Circ. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with prosecutors on March 19, Zimmerman's father identified the yells as George Zimmerman's, stating, "There is no doubt who is yelling for help. It is absolutely my son." Other relatives of Zimmerman, including his brother, concur and are equally adamant.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite news |title=Trayvon evidence fails to answer who screamed for help |agency=Reuters |date=May 18, 2012 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/18/us-usa-florida-shooting-idUSBRE84G1HF20120518}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a bond hearing on June 29, the 9-1-1 recording was played in court, and Zimmerman's father testified that "it was definitely George's" voice heard yelling for help in the recorded 9-1-1 call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gutman |first=Matt |title=George Zimmerman's Dad Testifies Voice Howling for Help Is His Son |publisher=ABC News |date=June 29, 2012 |url= http://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmermans-dad-testifies-voice-howling-son/story?id=16672554#.T-6sBhcnKAg |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to police reports, after listening to audio recordings of the 9-1-1 calls, Martin's father, Tracy Martin, told police investigators that it was not Trayvon Martin's voice yelling for help.&lt;ref name="nyt discovery" /&gt; Martin has since told reporters he was uncertain at that time, but that when he heard an enhanced recording on March 16 he was convinced it was his son yelling for help. Investigators interviewed Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, who reviewed the 9-1-1 calls to police and identified the voice crying for help as her son.&lt;ref name="cbs martins mother"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hancock|first=David|title=Court affidavit: Zimmerman profiled Trayvon Martin|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57413385/court-affidavit-zimmerman-profiled-trayvon-martin/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators also interviewed Martin's cousin who stated that without a doubt "on a stack of bibles" it was Martin yelling for help on the 9-1-1 tape.&lt;ref name="martins cousin"&gt;{{cite news |title=Prosecutors release another round of Zimmerman's evidence |publisher=MSNBC |date=July 12, 2012 |url=http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/07/12/12701508-prosecutor-releases-another-round-of-zimmerman-evidence?lite |accessdate=July 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715041939/http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/07/12/12701508-prosecutor-releases-another-round-of-zimmerman-evidence?lite |archivedate=July 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="martins cousin2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Robles |first=Frances |title=Detective in Zimmerman case said he was pressured to file charges |newspaper=Miami Herald |date=July 12, 2012 |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/trayvon-martin/article1941188.html |accessdate=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy Martin was skeptical of the account of his son's death told to him by Sanford police investigators and believed Zimmerman did not act in self-defense. Two days after the shooting, he was referred to civil rights attorney [[Benjamin Crump]],&lt;ref name="dtrotta01"/&gt; who was retained to pursue legal action and to persuade the news media to cover the case.&lt;ref name="Stelter-Long Route"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stelter|first=Brian| authorlink = Brian Stelter | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/business/media/for-martins-case-a-long-route-to-national-attention.html |title=In Slain Teenager's Case, a Long Route to National Attention | accessdate=April 7, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney Natalie Jackson and publicist Ryan Julison, both of Orlando, also joined the Martin team.&lt;ref name="dtrotta01"/&gt; Due to their efforts, the case started to receive national attention on March 7.&lt;ref name="dtrotta01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="liston"/&gt; On March 9, Crump announced he was suing to have 911 calls from the night of the shooting made public.&lt;ref name="cbs timeline STM"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57412417-504083/trayvon-martin-shooting-a-timeline-of-events/| publisher=CBS News | title=Trayvon Martin shooting: A timeline of events}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were released by the Sanford mayor on March 16.&lt;ref name="dtrotta01"/&gt; As attention to the case grew, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton gave media interviews and appeared at some of the protests being held which called for Zimmerman's arrest.&lt;ref name="dtrotta01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="million hoodie NYDN"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandoval|first=Edgar|title={{-'}}Million Hoodie' march takes Union Square|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-03-21/news/31222229_1_chief-bill-lee-arrest-jumaane-williams |newspaper=New York Daily News|date=March 21, 2012}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanford rally CT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands call for 'justice' at Trayvon Martin rally|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-23/news/chi-trayvon-martin-rally-20120323_1_national-action-network-sharpton-crowd|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, in an interview with CNN conducted during the trial of George Zimmerman, Alicia Stanley, Trayvon Martin's step-mother (Trayvon's father's former wife), stated that she believed Zimmerman had profiled Trayvon as a criminal, although she was not convinced that the profiling was based on race.&lt;ref name=ac360stanley&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1306/28/acd.01.html |title=Two Neighbors Testify in George Zimmerman Trial; Interview with Trayvon's Stepmother |work=Anderson Cooper 360 Degrees |publisher=CNN |date=June 28, 2013 |accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ac360stanley2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/bestoftv/2013/06/29/ac-trayvon-martin-stepmother-part-one.cnn |title=Trayvon Martin's stepmother speaks out |publisher=CNN |accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that she had no doubt that Zimmerman had started the fight and that Martin had reacted only in self-defense.&lt;ref name=ac360stanley/&gt;&lt;ref name=ac360stanley2/&gt;

===Zimmerman and family===
While the shooting was being investigated, Zimmerman, his wife, and his parents went into hiding due to threats they were receiving as the case gained more attention.&lt;ref name="zimmerman arrested usa today" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimmerman's father MH"&gt;{{cite news|last=Robles|first=Frances|title=Zimmerman's father: Our lives will never be the same|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/05/14/v-fullstory/2799569/zimmermans-father-our-lives-will.html|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=May 14, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512213234/http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/05/14/v-fullstory/2799569/zimmermans-father-our-lives-will.html|archivedate=May 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmerman left his job, and his school expelled him, citing safety concerns.&lt;ref name="Reuters prelude" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Who is GZ"&gt;{{cite news|last=Benitez|first=Gio|title=Who Is George Zimmerman?|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2012/03/26/who-is-george-zimmerman/|publisher=CBS Miami|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, Zimmerman placed a self-created web site on the internet, which included some brief statements, but no information about the shooting, since he had been advised by legal counsel not to discuss it. He also solicited donations for living expenses and legal defense costs.&lt;ref name="real GZ web site"&gt;{{cite news|last=Joseph|first=Channing|title=On a New Web Site, The Real George Zimmerman Speaks, and Solicits Funds|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/on-a-new-web-site-george-zimmerman-speaks-out|date=April 10, 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking over as Zimmerman's defense counsel on April 11, [[Mark O'Mara]] took down Zimmerman's self-created web site and replaced it with a professional information site.

====Defense of Zimmerman's character====
In an [[open letter]] on March 15, 2012, Zimmerman's father, Robert Zimmerman, defended his son against allegations that his actions were racially motivated, stating that Zimmerman was [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]], was raised in a multiracial family, and "would be the last to discriminate for any reason whatsoever", saying that the portrayal of his son as a racist "could not be further from the truth". Just as George Zimmerman's trial was set to begin, Robert Zimmerman published an [[e-book]] about the case in which he said that prior to the shooting, he had generally believed racism was no longer much of a problem and that he had personally not experienced much racism, despite being married to a Hispanic woman, but that since the shooting he had found that racism is "flourishing at the insistence of some in the African American Community".&lt;ref name=trueracists&gt;{{cite news|last=Legum|first=Judd|title=George Zimmerman's father says the 'true racists' are African-American|url=http://thinkprogress.org/media/2013/06/14/2162501/george-zimmermans-father-says-the-true-racists-are-all-african-american/| publisher=ThinkProgress |date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a chapter called "Who are the True Racists", Robert Zimmerman listed a host of African Americans he says are racist, including the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], the [[National Basketball Players Association]], the [[National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives]], the [[National Black Chamber of Commerce]], and the [[United Negro College Fund]], among others.

According to George Zimmerman's family, some of Zimmerman's relatives are black.&lt;ref name="wp-who" /&gt; Zimmerman's former lawyer Craig Sonner stated that Zimmerman is not a racist, and that he had mentored black youths in the past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2012/03/24/ac-sonner-trayvon-martin-shooting.cnn "Zimmerman atty.: Shooting isn't racist"].

In early April, an anonymous letter to the NAACP, which was signed "A Concerned Zimmerman Family Member" said Zimmerman had been one of the few to take any action to protest the 2010 beating of Sherman Ware, a black homeless man, by the son of a Sanford police officer. Zimmerman reportedly distributed fliers in the black community trying to get others involved too, and helped organize a January 8, 2011, Sanford City Hall community forum to protest the incident.&lt;ref name="zimmermanfamilymember"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dailycaller.com/2012/04/02/zimmerman-family-member-calls-naacp-racists-says-there-will-be-blood-on-your-hands-if-george-is-hurt/| title=Zimmerman family member calls NAACP 'racists,' says 'there will be blood on your hands' if George is hurt | publisher=Daily Caller | accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmerman's father confirmed his son's efforts on Ware's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-04-05/news/os-george-zimmerman-fliers-20120405_1_sherman-ware-justin-collison-robert-zimmerman Zimmerman's family: George handed out fliers, protesting police coddling of white suspect] ''Orlando Sentinel'' (April 5, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, the Miami Herald secured an audiotape of the January 8, 2011, Sanford City Hall community forum. On the audiotape, Zimmerman was heard criticizing the conduct of the Sanford Police Department in the Ware case. Zimmerman criticized former chief, Brian Tooley, and said Tooley had engaged in a "cover-up" and that he should lose his pension. He also said he'd been on ride-alongs with Sanford police where he found them to be lazy. The Herald also reported that it had contacted five out of six black churches where Zimmerman was reported to have distributed fliers on the Ware beating, however no one recalled receiving them.&lt;ref name="in2010Sanfordpolice" /&gt;

On July 12, 2012, reports of some of the more than 30 interviews conducted by the FBI were publicly released. Sanford Police investigator Chris Serino told FBI agents that he believed Zimmerman's actions were not based on Martin's race. Zimmerman's neighbors had nothing derogatory to say about him, and his co-workers were complimentary.&lt;ref name="cnn no racist"/&gt; CNN headlined its article on the FBI interviews "Witnesses tell FBI that George Zimmerman is no racist".&lt;ref name="cnn no racist"/&gt;

Allegations were also made that the Sanford police were protecting Zimmerman.&lt;ref name="Sentinel20120326Zimm" /&gt; Lee told reporters that they could not arrest Zimmerman because no evidence contradicted his story, and that to do so would leave the police open to litigation.&lt;ref name="NYT911" /&gt; In regards to the 9-1-1 dispatcher telling Zimmerman that "We don't need you to [follow him]",&lt;ref name="911calls"&gt;Clint Van Zandt, [http://video.msnbc.msn.com/newsnation/46786334 911 calls released in deadly Florida shooting], MSNBC.

He's not under a legal obligation to do that, so that is not something we can charge him with."&lt;ref name="StateAttorney" /&gt;

On March 21, 2012, three out of the five members of the Sanford City Commission, including the mayor, passed a [[motion of no confidence]] in regards to the Police Chief Bill Lee, and his handling of the case; however, the vote was advisory only.&lt;ref name="clickorlando"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.clickorlando.com/news/Mayor-2-others-pass-motion-of-no-confidence-in-police-chief/-/1637132/9655648/-/umrfxb/-/index.html|title=Mayor, 2 others vote 'no confidence' in police chief|publisher=WKMG Orlando|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Lee announced that he had temporarily stepped down from his position as chief of police, stating "my involvement in this matter is overshadowing the process." Lee further stated, "I do this in the hopes of restoring some semblance of calm to a city which has been in turmoil for several weeks."&lt;ref name="sentinel-chief" /&gt; On April 23, 2012, the city of Sanford announced that Police Chief Bill Lee would resign but city commissioners voted to reject the [[resignation]]. Some commissioners had concerns about the fairness of Lee losing his job and the mayor stated he preferred to wait for the results of an investigation. Lee was to remain on [[paid leave]].&lt;ref name="lee resignation"&gt;{{cite news|title=Florida city commission rejects police chief's resignation in Trayvon Martin case|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/23/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|publisher=CNN|accessdate=April 24, 2012|date=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with CNN, following his testimony at Zimmerman's trial, Bill Lee said that he felt pressure from city officials to arrest Zimmerman to placate the public rather than as a matter of justice.&lt;ref name="lee interview cnn"&gt;{{cite news|author=Elliott C. McLaughlin|title=Ex-Sanford police chief: Zimmerman probe 'taken away from us'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/10/justice/sanford-bill-lee-exclusive/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=July 11, 2013|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee said, "It was relayed to me that they just wanted an arrest. They didn't care if it got dismissed later." Lee further stated in the interview that the Sanford Police conducted a "sound" investigation, and the evidence provided no probable cause to arrest Zimmerman at the scene.&lt;ref name="lee interview cnn" /&gt; Lee said that the police needed to do a job, and there was some outside, and inside influence, that "forced a change in the course of the normal criminal justice process." The former police chief said the investigation was taken away from us and "we weren't able to complete it." Lee also said that his lead investigator made a recommendation that Zimmerman be charged with manslaughter, as a matter of protocol. The Sanford police presented a "''capias'' request" to the state's attorney, asking that they determine whether it was a "justifiable homicide".&lt;ref name="lee interview cnn" /&gt;

=="Stand your ground" laws==
The Zimmerman defense team initially planned to seek to dismiss the case against Zimmerman under the protection afforded by Florida's "[[Stand-your-ground law|stand your ground]]" self-defense law.&lt;ref name=seminolestate/&gt; The controversial law, passed in 2005, permits the use of deadly force when someone reasonably feels he or she is at risk of great bodily harm in a confrontation.&lt;ref name=syglawherald&gt;{{cite news|last=Caputo|first=Marc|title=Juror: we talked Stand Your Ground before not-guilty Zimmerman verdict|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/07/16/3502481/juror-we-talked-stand-your-ground.html|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmerman's defense team ultimately did not seek a pretrial hearing for immunity from prosecution based on the stand your ground law.&lt;ref name="no SYG hearing"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alcindor|first=Yamiche|title=Zimmerman self-defense hearing no longer in April|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/05/zimmerman-self-defense-hearing-no-longer-in-april/1964901/|work=USA Today|date=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brad |last=Knickerbocker |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2013/0721/Stand-your-ground-laws-rattle-US-politics-society |title='Stand your ground' laws rattle US politics, society |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=July 21, 2013 |accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as required by the stand your ground provision of the law, during the trial the judge instructed the jurors that Zimmerman had had no duty to retreat and had had a right to stand his ground and use deadly force if he reasonably believed doing so was necessary to defend himself.&lt;ref name=syglawherald/&gt; Prior to the passage of Florida's stand your ground law, the standard jury instructions from the judge would have included a statement that a person had a duty to attempt to retreat using "every reasonable means" before using deadly force.&lt;ref name=syglawherald/&gt;

[[Self-defense (United States)|Self-defense laws in the United States]], particularly [[Justifiable homicide#United States|regarding justifiable homicide]], vary by state. In many states, such laws exempt people in their own homes from the [[common-law]] requirement that one first [[Duty to retreat|attempt to retreat]], if one can safely do so, before resorting to the use of deadly force (the so-called "[[castle doctrine]]", based on the notion that "a person's home is his castle").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chow, J.D.|first=Andrew|title='Stand Your Ground' Laws: State by State|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/22/tagblogsfindlawcom2012-blotter-idUS212849160320120322|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323204107/https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/22/tagblogsfindlawcom2012-blotter-idUS212849160320120322|archivedate=March 23, 2012|agency=Reuters|date=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida's stand your ground law extends the no-retreat doctrine to vehicles and public places.&lt;ref name=protrero&gt;{{cite news|first=Ashley|last=Portero|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/317624/20120321/floirda-stand-ground-law-explained.htm|title=Florida's 'Stand Your Ground' Law: 5 Things To Know|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=March 21, 2012|accessdate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Martin's shooting, 22 other states had adopted similar stand your ground laws.&lt;ref name=protrero/&gt;

===Zimmerman's call to police===
Economist and commentator [[Thomas Sowell]] criticized the national media for implying that Zimmerman had continued to follow Martin after the police dispatcher said, "We don't need you to do that." He said that they mostly left out Zimmerman's answer, "O.K." because "too many people in the media see their role as filtering and slanting the news."&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas (April 24, 2012) [http://spectator.org/archives/2012/04/24/who-is-racist "Who is 'Racist'?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427075606/http://spectator.org/archives/2012/04/24/who-is-racist |date=April 27, 2012 }} ''The American Spectator''. Retrieved May 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the audio of the call was released, reports by [[CNN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/22/did-trayvon-martins-shooter-use-slur-in-911-tapes/ | title=Did Trayvon Martin's shooter use slur in 911 tapes? | work=Anderson Cooper 360 | publisher=CNN |date=March 22, 2012 | accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other news outlets alleged that Zimmerman had said "fucking coons" two minutes and twenty-one seconds (2:21) into the call. Two weeks later on April 4, 2012, CNN claimed that enhanced audio revealed that Zimmerman had said "fucking cold" (alluding to ongoing rain in February).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/04/george-zimmermans-911-call-audio-enhanced/?hpt=ac_bn2 "911 Tapes From Trayvon Martin Shooting: Was a racial slur uttered?"], CNN Anderson Cooper 360, AC360 Blogs, April 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, April 5, 2012, CNN's [[Martin Savidge]] reported that [[forensic]] audio expert Tom Owen claimed it was "fucking punks."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/05/justice/florida-teen-shooting/?hpt=hp_t1 "CNN's Martin Savidge reports on forensic analysis of 911 tape"].

===Deceptive audio editing by NBC===
Between March 19 and 27, 2012, the NBC Nightly News, NBC's ''Today'' show, and NBC's network-owned Miami affiliate [[WTVJ]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/NBC6-Zimmerman-Edit-Explanation-148961305.html |title=NBC6 Zimmerman Edit Explanation |publisher=[[WTVJ]] |date=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=June 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ran segments which misleadingly merged parts of Zimmerman's call. On one version of the recording played by NBC, Zimmerman was heard saying, "This guy looks like he's up to no good or he's on drugs or something...

He looks black." In the original 9-1-1 recording, Zimmerman said: "This guy looks like he's up to no good. Or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking around, looking about." The 9-1-1 operator then asked: "OK, and this guy, is he black, white or Hispanic?", and Zimmerman answered, "He looks black."&lt;ref name="Wemple20120331" /&gt; The phrase, "He's got his hand in his waistband, and he's a black male" came several exchanges after that point in the conversation.&lt;ref name="fired" /&gt;

Erik Wemple of ''The Washington Post'' wrote that NBC's alterations "would more readily paint Zimmerman as a racial profiler. In reality... Zimmerman simply answered a question... Nothing prejudicial at all in responding to such an inquiry... To portray that exchange in a way that wrongs Zimmerman is high editorial malpractice..."&lt;ref name="Wemple20120331" /&gt;

On December 6, 2012, Zimmerman filed a defamation lawsuit against NBC alleging that they intentionally edited the phone call so that Zimmerman would sound racist. The lawsuit said, "NBC saw the death of Trayvon Martin not as a tragedy but as an opportunity to increase ratings, and so set about to create the myth that George Zimmerman was a racist and predatory villain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Schneider, Mike|title=George Zimmerman sues NBC and reporters|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/george-zimmerman-sues-nbc-and-reporters-0|accessdate=December 7, 2012|date=December 6, 2012|publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Michael|title=George Zimmerman sues NBC Universal over edited 911 call|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/us/florida-zimmerman-nbc-lawsuit/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=December 7, 2012|date=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A NBC spokeswoman said the network strongly disagreed with the accusations that Zimmerman made in the complaint, stating, "There was no intent to portray Mr. Zimmerman unfairly and we intend to vigorously defend our position in court."&lt;ref name="nbc spokeswoman"&gt;{{cite news|title=George Zimmerman sues NBC and reporters|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/12/06/george-zimmerman-sues-nbc/1752149/|work=USA Today|accessdate=February 4, 2013|date=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, a summary judgment was issued in the network's favor which ended the lawsuit filed by Zimmerman.

==Aftermath==
Some legal scholars, including Charles Rose of Stetson University and [[Jonathan Turley]] of George Washington University, were not surprised by the verdict and said the prosecution had tactically erred by charging Zimmerman with second-degree murder, which, given Florida's laws on self-defense, made it almost impossible for the prosecution to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt with the evidence at their disposal.&lt;ref name=latverdictrep&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=David G.|title=Zimmerman verdict: legal experts say prosecutors overreached|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-zimmerman-legal-20130715,0,1600588.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USATverdictrep&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/14/zimmerman-trayvon-martin-lawyers-verdict/2516065/ Zimmerman verdict no surprise to many lawyers].

During a speech at to the NAACP, Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] stated that the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] was continuing to investigate Zimmerman for civil rights violations after the verdict, and also criticized existing "stand-your-ground" laws. Holder's speech was denounced by the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] and Florida Governor [[Rick Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NRA blasts Holder for attacking 'stand-your-ground' laws after Zimmerman verdict|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/17/nra-blasts-holder-for-attacking-stand-your-ground-laws-after-zimmerman-verdict/|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=July 17, 2013|date=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic leaders in the Florida legislature, Senate Minority Leader [[Chris Smith (Florida politician)|Chris Smith]] and House Minority Leader [[Perry E.

'''Civilian service''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] institution, created in 1996 as an alternative to [[Conscription in Switzerland|military service]]. It was introduced as part of the so-called ''Vision 95 (Armeeleitbild 95)'' reform package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsfk.de/fileadmin/HSFK/hsfk_downloads/Switzerland_9.pdf|title=The Normative Construction of the Soldier in Switzerland: Constitutional Conditions and Public Political Discourse|last=Mannitz|first=Sabine|date=2007|website=HSFK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, any man who is unable to do compulsory military service for [[Conscientious objector|reasons of conscience]] can submit an application to be allowed to do substitute civilian service instead. Formerly, the applicant was then forced to attend a hearing where he had to explain his reasons for refusal. Now, the applicant must take part in a one-day introductory session to civilian service within three months after submitting his application. 

If one is unfit to serve in the military because of physical or psychological impairments, he is also deemed unfit for civilian service, even if the impairments do not render the individual unable to fulfill a specific task related to the civilian service. This is true, for example, for a [[Disability|disabled]] person in a wheelchair who is perfectly able to work in the administration of a [[nursing home]]. Unless they have very severe handicaps such as [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], men are excused or declared unfit to serve in the military are forced to pay a substitute fee of about 3 percent of their yearly income until the age of 42, when military servicemen are normally released from further service. Women are also allowed to serve in the civilian service or in the [[Military|armed forces]] except in [[Military operation|combat missions]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Western Europe 2012|last=Thompson|first=Wayne|publisher=Stryker-Post Publications|year=2012|isbn=9781610488983|location=Lanham, MD|pages=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2005, the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Swiss parliament]] (see [[Politics of Switzerland|Swiss politics]]) began to discuss if the "state of conscience hearings" should be abolished and if the willingness to serve a longer time (see below) should be the only criterion, citing the large administrative costs for judging the cases of just a few thousand applicants per year. The high rate of young people opting to serve in the alternative service has also created organizational problems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democratic Civil-military Relations: Soldiering in 21st-century Europe|last=Mannitz|first=Sabine|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415516464|location=Oxon|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the civilian service option under the Vision 95 reform package has increased the rate of approval of the public, particularly the young segment of the population, for the existence of the Swiss armed forces.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Civilian service ==
Once part of the civilian service program, one has to work 50 percent longer than the total normal cumulative  military service period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Full cumulative military service for normal soldiers is currently{{When|date=September 2015}} 260 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2024.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; while full civilian service is 390 days. Many [[nonprofit organization]]s are licensed to employ civilian service workers. Unlike the former Civilian Service in Germany, where the servants did their work mainly in hospitals and healthcare sites, Swiss ones can apply for work in a broad variety of opportunities: health care, welfare, environmental protection, agriculture (small or alpine farms), research projects, and development assistance abroad.

Civilian servicemen must have the appropriate skills for each type of assignment – for example, because there are very few job vacancies in development aid.

A big difference between civilian and military service is that civilian service participants can greatly profit from his substitute service – in terms of work experience – to achieve a better position after the service, although it is formally not allowed to do civilian service with, for example, the goal of passing an exam in mind. So, during civilian service in a research institute, one must not write personal academic papers to be submitted at a later time.

There are still issues with how to handle Swiss living abroad who have already passed recruitment and are already members of the Swiss militia army. In this case, they are not exempt from military service or civilian service, and every step of the application process requires their presence in Switzerland.

'''''Uberrima fides''''' (sometimes seen in its [[Genitive case|genitive form]] '''''uberrimae fidei''''') is a [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase meaning "'''utmost good faith'''" (literally, "most abundant faith").  It is the name of a legal doctrine which governs [[insurance contract]]s. This means that all parties to an insurance contract must deal in [[good faith]], making a full declaration of all material [[fact]]s in the insurance proposal. This contrasts with the legal doctrine ''[[caveat emptor]]'' ("let the buyer beware").

==Insurance contracts==
A higher duty is expected from parties to an [[insurance contract]] than from parties to most other contracts in order to ensure the disclosure of all material [[fact]]s so that the contract may accurately reflect the actual risk being undertaken. The principles underlying this rule were stated by [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]] in the leading and often quoted case of ''[[Carter v Boehm]]'' (1766) 97 ER 1162, 1164,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Insurance is a contract of speculation...  The special facts, upon which the contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in the knowledge of the insured only: the under-writer trusts to his representation, and proceeds upon confidence that he does not keep back any circumstances in his knowledge, to mislead the under-writer into a belief that the circumstance does not exist... Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, Parkington, ed., MacGillivray and Parkington On Insurance Law, 8th ed. (1988) para. 544;  Brown and Menezes, Insurance Law in Canada, 2d ed. (1991) pp. 8-9; and 25 Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed. para. 365 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Therefore, the insured must reveal the exact nature and potential of the [[risk]]s that he transfers to the insurer (which may, in turn, be sold onto a reinsurer), while at the same time the insurer must make sure that the potential contract fits the needs of, and benefits, the insured. 

[[Reinsurance]] contracts (between reinsurers and insurers/cedents) require the highest level of utmost [[good faith]], and such utmost good faith is considered the foundation of reinsurance, which is an essential component of the modern insurance marketplace. In order to make reinsurance affordable, a reinsurer cannot duplicate costly insurer [[underwriting]] and claim handling costs, and must rely on an insurer’s absolute transparency and candor. In return, a reinsurer must appropriately investigate and reimburse an insurer’s good faith claim payments, following the fortunes of the cedent.&lt;ref&gt;Marcos Antonio Mendoza, "Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions", 21 Conn. Ins. L.J. 53, 65-67, 102-107 (2014) http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2573253&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiduciary duties==
The fact that a contract is one of utmost good faith does not mean, however, that it gives rise to a general [[Fiduciary|fiduciary relationship]]. The relationship between insured and insurer is not akin to the relationship between, say, [[Legal guardian|guardian]] and [[Ward (law)|ward]], [[Principal (commercial law)|principal]] and [[Agency (law)|agent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tosato|first=Andrea|date=2016-09-01|title=Commercial Agency and the Duty to Act in Good Faith|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ojls/gqv040|journal=Oxford Journal of Legal Studies|language=en|volume=36|issue=3|pages=661–695|doi=10.1093/ojls/gqv040|issn=0143-6503}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[trustee]] and [[beneficiary]]. In these latter instances, the inherent character of the relationship is such that the law has traditionally imported general fiduciary obligations. The insurer-insured relationship is contractual; the parties are parties to an arms-length agreement. The principle of ''uberrima fides'' does not affect the arms-length nature of the agreement, and cannot be used to find a general fiduciary relationship. The insurance contract, as noted above, imposes certain specific obligations on its parties.  These obligations, however, do not import general fiduciary duties into each and every insurance relationship. Before such fiduciary obligations can be imported there must be specific circumstances in the relationship that call for their imposition.

==Limitations==

The doctrine of ''uberrima fides'' is strictly limited in [[English law]] to the ''formation'' of the insurance contract.  During the mid-20th century, American courts expanded it much farther into a post-formation [[implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing]]. Violation of that implied covenant came to be seen as a tort, now known as [[insurance bad faith]].

The '''United States Trustee Program''' is a component of the [[United States Department of Justice]] that is responsible for [[wikt:oversee|overseeing]] the [[Public administration|administration]] of [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] cases and private [[Trustee in bankruptcy|trustees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/ust|website=Justice.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=7 January 2017|title=U.S. Trustee Program}}  {{include-DOJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The applicable [[United States federal legislation|federal law]] is found at {{USC|28|586}} and {{USC|11|101}}, [[wikt:et seq.|et seq.]]

In addition to the twenty-one '''United States Trustees''', the program is administered by the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees (EOUST), located in [[Washington, D.C.]], and 95 field offices. The United States Trustee is the federal official charged with enforcing civil bankruptcy laws in the United States.

==Overview==
The [[United States Attorney General]] generally appoints a separate United States Trustee for each of twenty-one geographical regions for a five-year term. Each United States Trustee is removable from office by and works under the general supervision of the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] (see {{USC|28|581}} and {{USC-Sub|28|586|c}}). Each United States Trustee, an officer of the Department of Justice, is responsible for maintaining and supervising a panel of private trustees for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] bankruptcy cases (see {{USC-Sub|28|586|a|1}}). The United States Trustee has other duties including the oversight of administration of most bankruptcy cases and trustees (see generally {{USC-Sub|28|586|a|3}}).

Each of the twenty-one regional U.S. Trustees maintains an office in each [[judicial district]] within the trustee's region, except for [[Alabama]] and [[North Carolina]], which are not administered by the U.S. Trustee program, but utilize what is called the bankruptcy administrator, performing a similar function to the U.S. Trustee. &lt;!--anyone know why?--&gt;

The U.S. Trustee does not have prosecution powers, but is required by law to refer information regarding potential [[criminal law|criminal]] violations of bankruptcy laws to the [[United States Attorney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|3057|pipe=Title 18 of the U.S. Code section 3057}}, which also applies to private trustees.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interim trustee]]s serve by the U.S. Trustee's appointment in Chapter 7 cases.  Generally the interim trustee is assigned at random from a "panel" of qualified individuals at the time a bankruptcy case is filed, and is automatically appointed as the "permanent" case trustee after the first meeting of creditors.

Due to the relative infrequency of filing of petitions for [[Chapter 12]] (family farmer debt adjustment) relief, trustees for these cases are typically appointed on an ''[[ad hoc]]'' basis.

Each judicial district has one or more Standing [[Chapter 13]] Trustees. The  Standing Trustees are responsible for the administration of all Chapter 13 cases filed in their judicial district.

If for any reason all panel and/or standing trustees are disqualified or unable to perform, the U.S. Trustee may serve as trustee for a particular case under Chapter 7, 12 or 13. This very rarely happens.

The U.S. Trustee's office conducts the first meeting of creditors in a [[Chapter 11]] case. Most Chapter 11's do not require the appointment of a trustee: however, in those cases which do, the U.S. Trustee oversees the appointed trustee's handling of the case and, for good cause, can seek the removal or replacement of the trustee. The U.S. Trustee may not, however, serve as the case trustee in Chapter 11. Along with the creditors committees, the U.S. Trustee acts as the primary "watchdog" to ensure compliance with the [[Title 11 of the United States Code|Bankruptcy Code]] in cases where no trustee has been appointed.

Accounting staffers within the Trustee's office review all debtor filings, and monitor trustee and attorney fees in all cases. Attorneys employed by the Trustee represent the office in [[United States bankruptcy court]] and pursue civil sanctions for some egregious violations of the law in Chapter 7, 12 and 13 cases.

==Executive Office for United States Trustees==
The Executive Office for United States Trustees (EOUST) is part of The [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ).  The EOUST is the component of the Department of Justice responsible for overseeing the administration of bankruptcy cases and private trustees. The responsibility of the EOUST as the top level office controlling DOJ attorneys who monitor conduct in [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]]s is analogous to that of The Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) as responsible for prosecutors of the DOJ. The current Director of the Office is Clifford J. White III.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/ust/eo/ust_org/office_locator.htm Nationwide Office Locator, Executive Office for United States Trustees, U.S. Department of Justice].&lt;/ref&gt;

In contract with the EOUSA, the EOUST maintains indirect publicity and refers to its offices as the "U.S. Trustee Program".

===Criminal referral===
When a government attorney working at the EOUST or any of its regional or field offices observes or suspects any criminal activity, it must be referred to the United States Attorney's Office in the District in which the suspected crime occurred.  The official policy of the EOUST is to include a review of such criminal referrals as part of the employee evaluation for each DOJ attorney employed as a U.S. Trustee.

The latter declaration was specifically written with more [[secular]] language than Universal Islamic Declaration, and was less biased against [[Shi'ite]] Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Mohammadi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1528">The '''Ventôse Decrees''' were decrees proposed on February 26 and March 3, 1794 (8 and 13 [[Ventôse]], An II in the [[French Republican Calendar]]) by the [[French Revolution|French revolutionary]] leader [[Louis de Saint-Just]].  Saint-Just proposed to confiscate the property of exiles and opponents of the Revolution, and redistribute it to the needy.  Saint-Just and other radicals argued that the enemies of the revolution had forfeited their civil rights, including the right to own property.

[[Robespierre]] supported the Decrees in theory, but realized that he lacked the support to implement them, and efforts to enforce the Decrees ended within a few months.
