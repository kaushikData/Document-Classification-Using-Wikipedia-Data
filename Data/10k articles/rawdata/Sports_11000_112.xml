The ''Air Jordan 1'' was first produced for [[Michael Jordan]] in 1984. It was designed by Peter C. Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Still The One: Why the Remastered Chicago Jordan 1 Is a Must-Have|url=http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2015/05/why-the-chicago-jordan-1-matters|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The red and black colorway of the Nike Air Ship, the prototype for the Jordan 1, was later outlawed by NBA Commissioner [[David Stern]] for having very little white on them (this rule, known as the '51 percent' rule, was repealed in the late 2000s decade&lt;ref&gt;https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nike-celebrating-banned-air-jordans-with-new-release-174631314.html&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solecollector.com/news/2016/07/the-true-story-behind-the-banned-air-jordan|title=The True Story Behind the Banned Air Jordan|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common misconception that the Jordan 1 was banned however, it was indeed the Nike Air Ship. After the Nike Air Ship was banned, Michael Jordan and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] introduced the Jordan 1 in color ways with more white such as the "Chicago" color way and the "Black Toe" color way. They used the Nike Air Ship's banning as a promotional tool in advertisements hinting that the shoes gave an unfair competitive advantage for the Jordan 1 and that whoever wore them had a certain edginess associated with outlaw activities.
Fragment x Jordan 1's: Staying true to the original Air Jordan, the remastered design features an all-over, premium leather execution with black overlays, blue accents, and Fragment insignia. The Air Jordan I was originally released on the market from 1985 to 1986, with re-releases (known as "retros") in 1994, 2001–2004, and 2007–2018.

* '''AJ II''':
[[File:Jordan II.jpg|thumb|right|190px|''Nike Air Jordan II'', (White/Red Colorway)]]
The success of the ''Air Jordan 1'' encouraged Nike to release the ''New Air Jordan'' in 1986 for the new basketball season. Designed by Peter Moore and Bruce Kilgore, the original Air Jordan II was unique in that it was [[made in Italy]]. The Air Jordan 2 also retailed with a full length encapsulated Nike air bubble for maximum comfort. The Air Jordan 2 was the first Jordan not to have the Nike swoosh on the upper. The ''Air Jordan II'' was originally retailed at $100. The Air Jordan was originally released from 1986 to 1987. The model was revived from obscurity when Air Jordan collaborated with Just Don to create the ''Just Don x Air Jordan 2''. The shoe featured premium blue quilted leather inspired by a Chanel handbag and released in very limited numbers on January 31, 2015 for $275. The shoe was released again in a ''Beach'' colourway bundled with a premium snapback and gold pin for $650 on January 30, 2016, later re-released in 1994, 2004–2005, 2008, 2010, 2014–2018.

* '''AJ III''':
[[File:Air Jordan III, (White Cement Colorway).jpg|200px|thumb|right|Nike Air Jordan III, (White Cement Colorway)]]
The ''Air Jordan III'' was designed by [[Tinker Hatfield]] who works for Nike as a designer for stores and offices. By that time Michael Jordan was ready to leave Nike, but the ''Jordan III'' changed his mind. It was the first Air Jordan to feature a visible air unit on the heel, the new [[Jumpman (logo)|Jumpman logo]], an elephant print trim and tumble leather to give it a luxury look. The ''Air Jordan III'' was also famous for the humorous ads depicting film director [[Spike Lee]] as [[Mars Blackmon]], the character he played in his film ''[[She's Gotta Have It]]''. This campaign was known as the "''Mars and Mike''" ad campaign, which was one of Nike's most successful advertisement campaigns. These were the first Jordans to feature the "''NIKE AIR''" logo on the back, but later replaced by the Jumpman logo, with the words "AIR" underneath it, similar to the ''Air Jordan VI''. These were said to be Michael Jordan's favorite shoes, he wore them during the [[NBA All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Contest#1980's|1988 NBA Slam Dunk Contest]] and many other events in his basketball career. The Air Jordan III's had poor sales when first reintroduced in 1994. On their second reintroduction in 2001, they sold well. The "Fire Red" ''Air Jordan III'' was released in March 2007, and late again in 2013.

In 2007, the Jordan Brand collaborated with director [[Spike Lee]] to release a limited pair of ''Air Jordan III''{{'}}s with a colorway based on the blue-yellow poster for Lee's film ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''. The same year also saw the reintroduced versions of the Air Jordan III's in two monotone colorways, all black and all white, nicknamed the "Black Cats" and the "Pure Moneys" respectively. 2007 also had the "Flips" which moved the elephant print from the trim to the entire shoe and replacing it with white leather, indeed "Flipping" the original design of white leather with elephant print trim.

In 2009, the Jordan Brand reintroduced the highly sought after ''Air Jordan III'' in the True Blue colorway. It was an international-only release, meaning they were not sold in the US. In 2011, the brand released a Black History Month&amp;nbsp;(BHM) Air Jordan III colorway in commemoration of the 35th anniversary of Black History Month. The sneaker is black with gold trim and stitching as well as laser print around the toe and heel. The ''BHM III'' was a very limited release and there was said to have been no more than 3,000 pairs made. Also, the same year saw the release of the "True Blue" III on June 4. The Stealth colorway of the III was released in September and the Black Cements were released in November.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sneakerfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/air-jordan-3-black-cement-retro.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; The "Black Flips" were released on December 3, 2011. In 2013, Jordan released a special edition of the Jordan III this shoe was deemed the Air Jordan III "Retro '88" White Cement and were released in February.

The multiple retros and new colorways have been released in 1994, 2001, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2016-2018.

* '''AJ IV''':
[[File:Nike Air Jordan IV, (White Cement Colorway).jpg|200px|thumb|right|Nike Air Jordan IV, (White Cement Colorway)]]
In 1989, Nike released the Air Jordan IV to the public. Designed by [[Tinker Hatfield]], it was the first Air Jordan released on the global market. It had four colorways: White/ Black-Cement Grey, Black/Cement Grey, White/Fire Red-Black, and Off White/Military Blue.

Nike featured director and actor Spike Lee in ads for AJ IV. Lee had featured the shoe in his movie ''[[Do The Right Thing]]''. The Air Jordan Bordeaux "Spiz'ike IV" was made to commemorate Lee's friendship with Michael Jordan.

The Air Jordan IV was on Jordan's feet when he made "[[The Shot]]," a series winner in Game 5 of the 1989 NBA First Round between the [[Chicago Bulls]] and the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. In 2012 a Cavalier colorway dubbed the "Cavs" was released to honor "The Shot."

The Air Jordan IV was re-released in 1999 and retroed in 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010–2013 and 2015–2018. Recent retroed colorways are the Retro 4 "Legend Blue", "Oreo" in early 2015, and the Retro 4 OG "Cement" that released on February 13, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sneakernews.com/releasedate/jordan-release/2016/02/|title=Release dates – Sneaker News|website=Sneaker News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''AJ V''':
[[File:Nike Air Jordan V .jpg|190px|thumb|right|Nike Air Jordan V, (Fire Red Colorway)]]
The Air Jordan V was released in February 1990, designed by [[Tinker Hatfield]] again. Some elements were carried over from the Air Jordan IV, but overall they were a completely new look. Some of its new features were a reflective tongue (with a unique protruding design and look), translucent rubber soles and lace locks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cultedge.com/2018/01/air-jordan-5-history/|title=Retro Vibes: Revisiting Air Jordan 5 Greatness • CultEdge.com|website=CultEdge.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soles gave them a new look, but it yellowed over time when exposed to moisture and were the source of many complaints early on due to the slippery nature of the soles when collecting dust.

Hatfield is believed to have drawn inspiration for the Air Jordan V from World War II fighter planes, which was most notably visible in the shark teeth shapes on the midsole.  The Air Jordan V was reintroduced in 2000, including a new colorway featuring Michael Jordan's high school (Laney High) colors. In 2006 several V's were reintroduced, including the LS "Grape" V's, the LS "burgundy" V's, the "Fire-Red" V's, the "Green Bean" V's, and "Stealth Blue V's. Along with the latter, a very limited laser design and the black/metallic/fire red colorways were released in early 2007.

In the month of May 2009, Air Jordan confirmed the release of an "DMP II" consisting of two Air Jordan V's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sneakerfiles.com/2009/03/14/air-jordan-v-5-raging-bull-detailed-pictures/ |title=Raging Bull Air Jordan V (5) – Red Suede – Release Date May 2009 |publisher=Sneaker Files |date=2009-03-14 |accessdate=2010-04-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100326063256/http://www.sneakerfiles.com/2009/03/14/air-jordan-v-5-raging-bull-detailed-pictures/| archivedate= 26 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second colorway features a 3M material base with black laces and midsole. The retail price was $310.

The shoe was retro-ed in 2000, 2006–2009, 2011, and 2013–2017.

The Air Jordan V saw a lot of use in popular sitcom ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. During many episodes [[Will Smith]] wore the 'metallic silver', 'grape', and 'fire red' colorway.  To pay tribute to his character, Jordan released the Air Jordan 5 Bel Air in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kicksonfire.com/tag/air-jordan-5-bel-air/|title=Air Jordan 5 Bel Air • KicksOnFire.com|website=KicksOnFire.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''AJ VI''':
[[File:Air jordan VIs.jpg|thumb|Air Jordan VI- 2010 Retro (Black/Varsity Red Colorway)]]
The Air Jordan VI had a new design by Tinker Hatfield and released in 1991. The Original 5 colorways were: Black/Infrared, White/Infrared, White/ Carmine-Black, White/Sport Blue, and Off White/Maroon. The Air Jordan VI introduced a reinforcement around the toe, It had two holes in the tongue, and a molded heel tab on the back of the sneaker (demanded by Jordan so it wouldn't hit his [[Achilles tendon]]). Like the Air Jordan V this sneaker also had Clear rubber/"Icy" Soles. The Air Jordan VI was the last Air Jordan to feature the Nike Air logo on it.

Later that year the [[Chicago Bulls|Bulls]] defeated the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] in the [[1991 NBA Finals]], with Jordan (wearing the Black/Infrared) named as the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|most valuable player]]. That was also the first NBA Championship won by Jordan and the Bulls. The Jordan VI was also seen in the film ''[[White Men Can't Jump]]'', which was produced in 1991 and released one year later.

The Air Jordan VI has been retro-ed many times since its original release in 1991, Notable releases were in 2000, 2010 and 2014 with the Black Infrared Colorway.

In addition to a Porsche-inspired rear pull tab and visible air the Air Jordan VI was the first Jordan with an inner bootie.

The shoe was retro-ed in 2000, 2002, 2006, 2008–2010, 2012, and 2014–2017.

The Air Jordan VI saw much of screen time in 2015's ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]''. Adonis Johnson ([[Michael B. Jordan]]) can be seen sporting the black/infrared and the white/varsity red-black colorway through most of the movie,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.champssports.com/sneaker-theater-creed/#|title=Sneaker Theater: Creed – The Drop {{!}} Champs Sports|date=2016-03-01|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably during the training montage before the big fight that Rocky films are known for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Floss Cov|title=Creed 2015 Training Montage 720 HD|date=2016-02-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NH1A6CLIrY|accessdate=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VI was the first shoe used by the protagonist of ''[[Slam Dunk (manga)|Slam Dunk]]'', Hanamichi Sakuragi.&lt;ref&gt;http://jansbasketball.blogspot.com/2012/07/air-jordan-shoes-that-used-in-slam-dunk.html&lt;/ref&gt; Nike released special versions of both the VI and the Jordan Super.Fly 3 featuring artwork from the series in 2014. The VI also had Sakuragi's number 10 embroidered on the side of the heels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2014/10/jordan-brand-slam-dunk-collection-official-images&lt;/ref&gt; Various other models in the Air Jordan line are featured in the series, including the original (which Sakuragi eventually switched to), the V, and the XII (both worn by Sakuragi's rival, Kaede Rukawa).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2014/10/best-sneakers-slam-dunk-manga-anime-series/&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''AJ VII'''
[[File:Air Jordan VII (Maillot N°9 de la Dream Team).JPG|thumb|200px|''Air Jordan VII'' sneakers specially released for [[1992 Barcelona Olympics]].]]
The Air Jordan VII was released in 1992 with a new design by Tinker Hatfield. This shoe introduced the huarache technology which allowed the shoes to better conform to the user's foot. A few things were no longer featured on the new model, such as the visible air sole, the Nike Air logo, and the translucent soles. This was the first Air-Jordan in the line that did not have any distinctive "Nike Air" on the outer portions of the shoe. The "Nike Air" branding was still on the in-soles, which Air Jordans VIII-XI also had.  The VIIs were also known for a successful ad campaign in which [[Bugs Bunny]] appeared alongside Michael Jordan to market the shoes.

When Jordan went to compete at the [[1992 Barcelona Olympics]] to play for the US Men's Basketball Team (also known as the "[[United States men's national basketball team#1992 Olympics (Barcelona) – The Dream Team|Dream Team]]"), Nike released a special Olympic color combo of the Air Jordan VII model which had Jordan's Olympic jersey number 9, instead of the usual "23" found on other colorways.

Various models of the Air Jordan VII were re-released in 2002, again in 2004, and again with different colors in 2006.

In 2011 the Air Jordan VII saw releases in the "Orion" and "Bordeaux" colorways. Other colorways are confirmed for a 2011 release as well, such as the "Cardinals" which is a re-release and "Year of the Rabbits". The "Olympic" and "Charcoal" (commonly referred to as Raptors) were re-released in 2012.

The shoe was retro-ed in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008–2012, and 2015–2017.

* '''AJ VIII''':
[[File:Air Jordan VIII, (Playoffs Colorway).jpg|200px|thumb|right|Nike Air Jordan VIII, (Playoffs Colorway)]]
The Air Jordan VIII was released to coincide with the [[1992–93 NBA season|1992–1993 NBA season]]. The eighth model of the Air Jordan was noticeably heavier than its predecessors. This shoe had a lot more detail than most of the earlier Air Jordans such as two crossover straps on each shoe and a Jumpman. Thus the Air Jordan VIII model became known as the "Punisher" because of the advanced basketball ankle support and enhanced traction. This shoe contains a full length air sole, [[polyurethane]] midsole, [[polycarbonate]] shank plate, and two crossover straps (for added support and more custom fit).

The shoe was retro-ed in 2003, 2007, 2008, 2013, and 2015–2017.

* '''AJ IX''':
[[File:Nike Air Jordan IX.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Nike Air Jordan IX, (Bulls Colorway)]]
Originally released in November 1993, the ''Air Jordan IX'' model was the first model released after Michael Jordan's retirement. Jordan never played an NBA season wearing these shoes. This model was inspired by baseball cleats that Jordan wore when playing minor-league baseball.

Like the ''VII'' and ''VIII'' models, the ''Air Jordan IX'' featured an inner sock sleeve and [[nubuck]] accents. The sole featured different symbols and languages of different countries. The ''Air Jordan IX'' has been the shoe chosen to adorn Jordan's feet for his statue outside of the [[United Center]] in [[Chicago]].

In popular culture, in the children's movie ''[[The Little Rascals (film)|The Little Rascals]]'' one of the bullies, Butch is wearing a pair of these shoes. American rap icon [[Tupac Shakur]] also wore Air Jordans in a popular "Thug Life" photo set in 1993.

The shoe was retro-ed in 2002, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014–2018.

* '''AJ X''':
[[File:Nike Air Jordan X Steel.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Nike Air Jordan X, (Steel Colorway)]]
This was released in 1995 in eight different colors, Black/grey, varsity-black, off-white/black/varsity red*, Powder Blue (worn by [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]'s [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|Men]]'s and [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's basketball|Women]]'s basketball teams), [[Orlando Magic]]*, [[New York Knicks]]*, [[Seattle SuperSonics]]*, and [[Sacramento Kings]]*.
It was the first ''Air Jordan'' to feature a lightweight Phylon midsole. The shoe also featured all of Michael Jordan's accomplishments so far on the outsole.

In 2012, the ''Air Jordan X'' was re-released. They are dubbed the "Chicago Bulls", as they are part of a regional pack (City Pack), representing five teams. The lacing and tongue are completely black, and the red inner lining contrasts with the red inserts on the outsole. The outsole's design features a striped (wavy) design, which list many of Jordan's accomplishments. They retailed at $160. The Air Jordan X was released again in an ''OVO'' collaboration in 2015 and 2016, releasing in white and black colorways respectively with stingray detailing.

The shoe was retro-ed in 2005, 2008, 2012–2016, and 2018.

* '''AJ XI''':
[[File:Air Jordan XI.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Nike Air Jordan XI, (Bred Colorway)]]
This model was designed by Tinker Hatfield. When the shoe launched, Michael Jordan (retired from basketball by then) was with the [[Birmingham Barons]] in baseball's minor baseball leagues. Hatfield designed the sneaker waiting for Jordan to come back and hoping he would play in them.

The ballistic mesh upper of the sneaker was meant to make the Air Jordan XI lighter and more durable than past sneakers. Further changes came with the use of a carbon fiber spring plate in the translucent "frosty" outsole, giving the shoe better torque when twisting on the court. The highlight and arguably best-known aspect of the shoe is its patent leather mudguard. Patent leather was lightweight compared to genuine leather and also tended not to stretch as much – a property to help keep the foot within the bounds of the foot bed during directional changes on the court. The patent leather gave the XI a "formal" look.  When this shoe released, some wore this model with business suits instead of dress shoes.

The sneakers were only samples in 1995 when Jordan decided to come back to the NBA. Hatfield and Nike discouraged Jordan from playing in them, but once they were produced, he couldn't resist. Also noteworthy, Jordan violated league dress code by wearing the shoes, as his teammates wore all-black shoes. It wasn't the first time Jordan had run afoul of NBA footwear rules, having broken them with his very first signature shoe in 1985. He was fined $5,000 for not following the Bulls colorway policy with the AJ XI. After the fine, Nike made him a pair of the shoes in a black/white/concord colorway for the series against Orlando. A similar black/white/royal blue colorway was released to the public at the end of 2000. The colorway was changed for the public release because the concord purple had looked like royal blue on television.

Jordan wore the ''Air Jordan XI'' on the way to helping the Chicago Bulls claim the [[1995–96 NBA season|1995–96 NBA Championship]]. He also wore the XI white Columbia colorway in the [[1996 NBA All-Star Game]] and was selected [[NBA All-Star Game MVP|MVP]] of the game. The shoes received more media exposure when Jordan wore the ''Air Jordan XI'' model in the 1996 animated movie ''[[Space Jam]]''. These shoes were eventually released in 2000 and re-released in 2009 with the nickname ''Space Jams''. The concord purple was changed to royal blue for the released versions of the shoe.

The Air Jordan XI was originally released from 1995 to 1996. It was retro'd in 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2006–2018. The Air Jordan XI is the most popular Air Jordan in the series and has released almost ritualistically every December since 2008, selling out in minutes. It also is Hatfield's favorite. With the Air Jordan XI being the most popular Jordan, supply used to be very limited and would cause fans to line up outside of stores before releases.

* '''AJ XII''': ''Main article: [[Air Jordan Retro XII]]''
[[File:Air Jordan XII Playoffs.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Nike Air Jordan XII, (Playoffs Colorway)]]
The ''Air Jordan XII'' was inspired by [[Flag of Japan|Nisshoki]] (the Japanese flag), and a 19th-century women dress boot. However, featuring gold-plated steel lace loops, embossed lizard skin pattern and a full length zoom air unit with a carbon fiber shank plate, this model set a new direction in style and technology in shoe design. Though not as light weight as previous models, the construction and firmness of the shoe is widely considered to be the most durable and sturdy shoes from the ''Air Jordan'' line. 
The first model released after the creation of subsidiary Jordan Brand, the Air Jordan XII has no ''Nike'' branding on it of any kind, while all the models before it have ''Nike Air'' or other ''Nike'' branding outwardly (Air Jordans I-VI) or just simply on the insoles (Air Jordans VII-XI). This shoe came in 5 colorways and was released on March 13. The shoe was re-released on December 25, 2008 with the Eleven as the final countdown pack. In addition, the Twelve was combined with the Thirteen numbered Jordan to produce the 12.5. As of today, the 11/12 countdown package (retro) retails for {{dollarsign|USD|750|lk=on}}–{{dollarsign|USD|800|lk=off}}, well above the starting price of {{dollarsign|USD|310|lk=off}}. The Air Jordan XII has been subject to many highly limited colorways recently such as the ''Air Jordan 12 x PSNY'' collaboration, the ''Wings'' colorway that was limited to 12,000 pairs, and the ''OVO'' collaboration.

The Air Jordan XII was originally released from 1996 to 1997. It was retro-ed in 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2011–2013, and 2015–2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/ray_allen/ |title=Ray Allen Stats, Bio and Game Logs |publisher=NBA.com |date=1975-07-20 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''AJ XIII''':
[[File:Nike Air Jordan XIII.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Nike Air Jordan XIII, (White/black-varsity red Colorway)]]
In 1997, ''Air Jordan XIII''{{'}}s were released to the public. This model was known for its cushioning along the feet, designed by Hatfield. The Black Panther was the inspiration for the Air Jordan XIII, the sole resembles the pads on a panther's paw. But also the panther is the hologram on the back of the shoe which imitates a panther's eyes in the dark when light is shined at them. They were re-released in 2005, which coincided with the release of the ''Air Jordan 8s'' shoe.

In the movie ''[[He Got Game]]'', the Air Jordan XIII was worn by Jake Shuttlesworth ([[Denzel Washington]]). [[Ray Allen]], who played Jake's son Jesus in the film, wore them when he broke [[Reggie Miller]]'s all-time record for made three-point shots during a game against the Lakers in Boston during the 2011 season. The Jordan Brand re-released the ''Air Jordan XIII'' at the end of 2010, which included the French Blue/Flint Grey, White/Red-Black, "Playoff" color way and the Black/Altitude Green color way. In 2017, Jordan Brand released the "History of Flight" colorway. This colorway is from the 2009 World Basketball Festival, where the "History of Flight" collection was revealed to celebrate Jordan's 25th anniversary.

The shoe was retro-ed in 2004, 2005, 2008, and 2010–2018.

* '''AJ XIV''':
[[File:Nike Air Jordan XIV.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''Nike Air Jordan XIV'', (Black Toe Colorway)]]

Inspired by the [[Ferrari 550|Ferrari 550 M]] which Michael Jordan owned, the Air Jordan XIV was originally released from 1997 to 1999. It was re-released in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2014–2018.

The Air Jordan XIV co-styled by Hatfield and Mark Smith was made race ready and equipped with the Jordan Jumpman insignia on a Ferrari shaped badge. In addition, these shoes include breathable air ducts on the outer sole. The color scheme of predominant black accentuated with red was nicknamed "The Last Shot" because Michael Jordan wore them as he hit the game winning shot over [[Bryon Russell]], of the [[Utah Jazz]], in his final game with the Chicago Bulls in the [[1998 NBA Finals]].

There are 14 Jumpman logos on Air Jordan XIV's—7 on each shoe—corresponding the shoes' number in the series.  They can be found in the following places:

# Near the toebox x 1
# Shield Logo near the achilles heel x 1
# Above the number "23" at the heel x 1
# At the bottom sole (middle part) x 1
# Steel Lacetips x 2

The ''Air Jordan XV''s were released in 1999–2000. [[Reggie Miller]] wore it during the [[2000 NBA Finals]].

The ''Jordan XV's'' were the first ''Air Jordans'' to be negatively received in a while (the last being the ''Air Jordan 2's''), because the quality on the Jordan shoes was bad.&lt;ref name="air-jordans.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.air-jordans.com/# |title=Nike Store.

''Air Jordan XVI''s, designed by Nike's Senior Footwear Designer Wilson Smith, were released in 2001. This meaning it was the first design since the II's that Hatfield was not behind. Smith decided to bring in a few design elements/fabrics from earlier releases. The shoe featured the return of the clear rubber sole (V, VI, XI) and patent leather (XI).

Unique to the Air Jordan XVI was a gaiter/shroud that covered the shoe and could be removed to give the shoe a new look. Not only was this for fashion purposes, it also had a thermal functionality.

The shoe was said to be stiff and that the shroud/gaiter could easily fall off when playing basketball. The black/red and white/midnight navy versions of the shoe both featured patent leather which very easily creased and cracked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.air-jordans.com/content/frame.html |title=Nike Store.

The inspiration for the design came from a number of things; sleek racing lines of the auto world, carbon fibre-based monocoque of F1 race cars, race car driving shoes (rubber heel wrap) and Fine Italian dress shoes (bold stitching on the soles).

Three regional colorways and three special edition colorways were released. They consisted of the East, West, and Midwest edition for regular and West, East, and Olympic for the SE (special edition).

The ''Air Jordan XIX'' used innovative materials. The upper section of shoe was developed in collaboration with the global materials consultancy [[Material ConneXion]], who sourced Nike a sleeving normally used in architectural applications for protecting [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] pipes from bursting. In theory, this allowed for a shoe without laces, because the sleeving does not stretch. Nonetheless, the ''Air Jordan XI''X model did include a set of laces behind the sleeve to better secure the shoe. They are the lightest Air Jordans ever made.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==="Jordan Son of Mars edition"===
The "Jordan Son of Mars" is an Air Jordan hybrid shoe, that released in the Summer of 2012. It borrows prominent design elements from the Air Jordan III, IV, V, VI, and XX.
It also retains a strap across the shoe laces, that is a custom modification with a design that seems to be elephant print but is instead a series of relevant icons, etc.
The Jordan Son Of Mars was birthed from the [[Spizike]], which was originally inspired by all the Jordan shoes made in collaboration with famous urban director [[Spike Lee]]. Son of Mars is a sneaker directly influenced by Spike Lee's longtime involvement with the brand, as the shoe pieces together models in which Spike (or [[Mars Blackmon]] rather) had a hand in launching.

The shoe breakdown begins with elements from the first [[Tinker Hatfield]] years, Mars Blackmon; Lee's loudmouthed character first appeared alongside Michael Jordan for the release of the Air Jordan III, a sneaker whose immediately recognizable elephant print bookends the Jordan Son of Mars, with sectioning on the back end and towards the toe. Next the Air Jordan IV, which is pretty conspicuous in this hybrid release, shows up only in the form of the netting running below the laces. The sole '''gottem''' ion is all Air Jordan V, as the coveted icy treatment splashes across the bottom and the angular 'teeth' of the midsole rear up towards the toe. The V actually extends its reach to the top end too, with the textured Jumpman tongue bursting out from the familiar see-through lacelocks. Building up the ankle area is the higher-hitting support of the Air Jordan VI, complete with the attached loop on back and the perforated paneling reaching up the side of the shoe. The midsection which completes the sneaker is a major fast-forward, leaping ahead to the Air Jordan XX in the form of the lasered strap.

The Jordan Son of Mars takes on one of the favorite color schemes in the Jordan Brand line.

[[File:Air Jordan 6ix rings olympic dream and black red.jpg|thumb|Air Jordan "6 rings" in two colorways]]
The Jordan 6 Rings (aka Jordan Six Rings) is a combination of the seven Air Jordan shoes that Michael Jordan wore during his 6 Championship seasons. That includes the Air Jordan 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13 and 14. The Jordan Brand company released the "6 Rings" shoes starting in September 2008.

The Jordan Brand released colorways representative of each team that the Chicago Bulls defeated in each of their six championship seasons during the 1990s. The colorways include colors borrowed from the following teams: the L.A. Lakers, Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns, the former Seattle SuperSonics, and Utah Jazz, each shoe of which includes laser-etched graphics detailing specific aspects about that particular championship series, the city of the competing team and so forth. Many other colorways exist and Jordan Brand continues to release additional colors that pay tribute to different Jordan and Nike shoes along with new colorways specific to 6 Rings shoes.

There even exists a "winterized 6 rings" which are a modified 6 Rings shoe turned into a durable boot designed for the outdoors which changes some of the design and placement of the inspired pieces and parts from the Air Jordans the shoe pays tribute.

Of particular note, there is an Olympic colorway, a Nelly version apparently inspired by the rap artist [[Nelly]] and a shoe that combines the colors of all the teams that the Bulls defeated in the NBA Finals, acting as the 'sixth shoe' since only five separate teams were defeated for the Bulls to win six championships; the Utah Jazz was defeated twice, in 1997 and 1998.

In 1988, the then-principal of [[Mumford High School]] in Detroit mentioned that clothing-related violence had reached a point where he felt it was necessary to ban certain items of clothing, including the Air Jordan sneaker, from the school grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tom Hundley |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-04-03/news/8803050777_1_air-jordans-dress-code-troop |title=School Puts `In` Clothes On Notice |work=Chicago Tribune |date=1988-04-03 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ban was the first of many dress codes implemented in schools after the wave of robberies, beatings, and shootings over possession of Air Jordan sneakers and other items of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petermarina.com/DOCUMENTS/JYS.pdf |format=pdf |title=Cultural meaning and hip-hop fashion in the African-American male youth subculture of New Orleans |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2013-05-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906230836/http://petermarina.com/DOCUMENTS/JYS.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing===
[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] owns none of the factories where Air Jordans are produced and contracts the work to various factory owners. Company officials say that they only design and market the shoes. However, Nike dictates production terms and standards to the contractor, often without questioning labor or safety practices. In April 1997, 10,000 Indonesian workers went on strike over wage violations at an Air Jordan factory. The same month in Vietnam 1,300 workers went on strike demanding a 1-cent-per-hour raise, and a year later in 1998, 3,000 workers in China went on strike to protest hazardous working conditions and low wages cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalexchange.org/sweatfree/nike/faq|title=Nike FAQs - Global Exchange|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026223516/http://www.globalexchange.org/sweatfree/nike/faq|archivedate=26 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arena Pantanal''' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Cuiabá]], [[Brazil]]. Completed on 26 April 2014, it is used mostly for [[Association football|football]] and hosted four group stage matches during the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nz.sports.yahoo.com/news/article/-/22340876/unfinished-brazil-stadium-opens/ |title=Unfinished Brazil stadium opens |last1=Azzoni |first1=Tales |date=April 3, 2014 |website=sports.yahoo.com |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407104657/http://nz.sports.yahoo.com/news/article/-/22340876/unfinished-brazil-stadium-opens/ |archivedate=April 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the World Cup, the arena had a capacity of 41,390, and currently can seat 44,003 spectators.

Prior to its use for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the venue received much criticism. It suffered a fire in October 2013, due to [[polystyrene]] insulation panels catching alight. Although nobody was injured, the fire came within 24 hours of the state governor of [[Mato Grosso]] warning that it may not be finished for the World Cup.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tony Jimenez|first1=Andrew|title=Soccer-Cuiaba fire adds to Brazil's World Cup woes|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/soccer-cuiaba-fire-adds-brazils-world-cup-woes-205257620--sow.html|publisher=Yahoo|agency=Reuters|date=25 October 2013|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the day of its opening, on 24 April 2014, 5,000 seats were still to be installed in the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www1.skysports.com/FIFA-World-Cup-2014/news/12098/9280002/world-cup-copacabana-riots-cast-further-shadow-over-brazil-2014-preparations.|title=Copacabana riots cast further shadow over Brazil 2014 preparations|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next to the football stadium is the [[Ginásio Aecim Tocantins]].

'''[[Barbados]]''' competed at the '''[[2012 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] from 27 July to 12 August 2012. This nation marked its eleventh appearance at the Olympic games.

The [[Barbados Olympic Association]] sent the nation's smallest team to the Games. A total of six athletes, all men, participate only in athletics, judo, and swimming. The nation's female athletes, however, failed to compete for the first time in its history since its national debut at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in Mexico City. The Barbadian team also included backstroke and medley swimmer [[Bradley Ally]], who competed at his third Olympic games. Sprint hurdler [[Ryan Brathwaite]] was appointed by the committee to be the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony.

Barbados left London, however, without winning a single Olympic medal for the third consecutive time. Brathwaite, the nation's Olympic hopeful, nearly missed out of the medal standings, finishing abruptly in fifth place.

'''Benjamin Earl Franklin "Ben" Davidson, Jr.''' (June 14, 1940 – July 2, 2012) was an [[American football]] player, a defensive end best known for his play with the [[Oakland Raiders]] in the [[American Football League]]. Earlier in his career, he was with the [[Green Bay Packers]] and [[Washington Redskins]] of the [[National Football League]].&lt;ref name=nytob&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/sports/football/ben-davidson-defensive-end-dies-at-72.html |newspaper=New York Times |agency=Associated Press |title=Ben Davidson, defensive end, dies at 72 |date=July 3, 2012 |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latob&gt;{{cite news|last=Dillman |first=Lisa |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-ben-davidson-20120704,0,7541335.story |title=Ben Davidson dies at 72; Oakland Raider, fixture in beer commercials |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=July 4, 2012 |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=quessrdr&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/25/sports/la-sp-crowe-20100726 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |last=Crowe |first=Jerry |title=For Ben Davidson, the quintessential Raider, football was the ticket to a great life |date=July 25, 2015 |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Born and raised in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], Davidson was the son of Avis (née Wheat) and Benjamin Earl Franklin, Senior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/w/i/l/Tracy-Lynne-Williamson/GENE7-0004.html |title=Family Tree Maker's Genealogy Site: Genealogy Report: Descendants of Benjamin (Frank) Franklin Davidson |publisher=Familytreemaker.genealogy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Los Angeles)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] in the [[El Sereno, Los Angeles|El Sereno]] neighborhood of Los Angeles, but did not play [[High school football|football in high school]]; because of his height ({{height|ft=6|in=8}}), [[High school basketball|basketball]] and track were more to his liking.&lt;ref name=dshhlsd&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2VxWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NPADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6566%2C1114081 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |last=Weaver |first=Dan |title=Davidson shows his Liter side |date=April 23, 1992 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While attending junior college at [[East Los Angeles College]], he was spotted by the football coach and asked to join the team. He was subsequently recruited to play at the [[Washington Huskies football|University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]] in [[1959 Washington Huskies football team|1959]], where he flourished as a member of [[1960 Rose Bowl|consecutive]] [[1961 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]]-winning teams under head coach [[Jim Owens]] and gained entry into professional football.

==Professional career==
===NFL===
Davidson was selected in the [[1961 NFL draft#Round four|fourth round]] of the [[1961 NFL draft]] by the [[1961 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], but was traded in training camp to the [[1961 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]].&lt;ref name=dbsltgl&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jsonline.com/packerinsider/brief-stay-leads-to-glory-131560758.html |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |last=Hendricks |first=Martin |title=Davidson's brief stay leads to glory |date=October 11, 2011 |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a rookie, he played mostly special teams for the Packers in [[1961 Green Bay Packers season|1961]], who beat the Giants 37–0 in the [[1961 NFL Championship Game|championship game]], the first of five NFL titles for head coach [[Vince Lombardi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-videos/09000d5d8060ece8/1961-NFL-Championship-Game 1961 NFL Championship Game at NFL.Com]&lt;/ref&gt; During training camp in 1962, Davidson was traded to the [[1962 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] for a fifth round draft choice.&lt;ref name=dttred62&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ysEVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1hAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6889%2C1177522 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |last=Lea |first=Bud |title=Davidson traded to Redskins |date=August 21, 1962 |page=2, part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played there in [[1962 Washington Redskins season|1962]] and [[1963 Washington Redskins season|1963]], until he was waived in September [[1964 Washington Redskins season|1964]] final cuts after not meeting the team's strict weight guidelines.&lt;ref name=dbsltgl/&gt;&lt;ref name=ppbfoc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jNhaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hWwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5196%2C1765022 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |agency=Associated  |title=Barnes, five other cut by Redskins |date=September 10, 1964 |page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFL===
Davidson is best remembered his play with the [[American Football League]] [[Oakland Raiders]].  [[Al Davis]] signed him as a free agent shortly after his release from the Redskins and he thrived as a pass rusher under head coaches Davis, [[John Rauch]], and [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]]. Davidson played in Oakland from [[1964 Oakland Raiders season|1964]] through [[1972 Oakland Raiders season|1972]], and was part of the [[AFL–NFL merger|league merger]] in {{nfly|1970}}. He was an [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star]] in 1966, 1967, and 1968.

The Raiders won the [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|AFL championship]] in [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|1967]] and played in [[Super Bowl II]], but were overmatched by the [[1967 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]. Oakland advanced to the AFL title games the next two seasons but lost to the [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in [[1968 American Football League Championship Game|1968]] and the [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] in [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|1969]], the league's last game. A stretched [[Achilles tendon]] in 1972 kept him on the sidelines that entire season.&lt;ref name=dsbhim&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r6dYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l_gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3217%2C1680242 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Davidson style belies his image |date=February 6, 1973 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dawson-Taylor incident====
On November 1, [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|1970]], the [[Super Bowl IV|defending world champion]] [[1970 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] led the Raiders 17–14 late in the fourth quarter, and a long run for a first-down by Chiefs quarterback [[Len Dawson]] apparently sealed victory for the Chiefs in the final minute when Dawson, as he lay on the ground, was speared by Davidson, who dove into Dawson with his helmet, provoking Chiefs' receiver [[Otis Taylor (American football)|Otis Taylor]] to attack Davidson. After a bench-clearing brawl, offsetting penalties were called, nullifying the first down under the rules in effect at that time. The Chiefs were obliged to punt, and the Raiders tied the game on a [[George Blanda]] field goal with eight seconds to play. Davidson's play not only cost the Chiefs a win, but Oakland won the [[AFC West]] with a season record of 8–4–2, while Kansas City finished 7–5–2 and out of the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ KC Chiefs website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609052751/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ |date=2008-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DtchMastr |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SdzXsUJF98#t=35s |title="Big" Ben Davidson - Oakland Raiders |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, the NFL changed its rules regarding personal fouls, separating those called during a play from those called after it.

===WFL===
Three years out of football, Davidson signed with the [[Portland Storm#1974 regular season|Portland Storm]] in early September 1974, already midway through the [[World Football League]]'s inaugural [[1974 World Football League season|1974]] season.&lt;ref name=dssct&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bDRWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4ucDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1274%2C818676 |newspaper=Eugene Register Guard |location=Oregon |title=Davidson signs Storm contract |date=September 4, 1974 |page=1B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbrrst&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bzRWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4ucDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1733%2C1707243|newspaper=Eugene Register Guard |location=Oregon |last=Cawood |first=Neil |title=Big Ben, Roadrunner stir the Storm, 15-8 |date=September 7, 1974 |page=1B }}&lt;/ref&gt; While with the Storm, he lived in his motor home that he drove up from California.&lt;ref name=dshhlsd/&gt; A late season knee injury in early November ended his season and playing career.&lt;ref name=swhtmi&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AJ8gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jGgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1020%2C1655789 |newspaper=Lewiston Evening Journal |location=Maine |title=Storm will have to make it without Ben Davidson |date=November 9, 1974 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment career==
Davidson appeared in a few films including ''[[The Black Six]]'', ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H]]'', and ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''. He portrayed Porter the Bouncer in ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'' in [[1972 in film|1972]] and a convict football player in ''[[Necessary Roughness (film)|Necessary Roughness]]'' in [[1991 in film|1991]].  Davidson played himself in [[Miller Lite]] ads featuring [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]] and [[Rodney Dangerfield]]. He also appeared in the short lived 1976 show ''[[Ball Four (TV series)|Ball Four]]'', the 1977 pilot for ''[[Lucan (TV series)|Lucan]]'' and the 1984 TV series Goldie and the Bears. Davidson also appeared in an episode of the 1970's TV series [[Happy Days]] as a lumberjack.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3095">The '''Best Female Soccer Player [[ESPY Award]]''' was presented annually between [[2002 in sports|2002]] and [[2004 in sports|2004]] to the [[female]] [[Association football|soccer]] ([[association football]]) player adjudged to be the best in a given [[calendar year]] among those contesting the sport on the [[professional sports|professional]] or [[FIFA|international]] level.  The award—and the [[Best Male Soccer Player ESPY Award]]—evolved from the [[Best Soccer Player ESPY Award]], which was awarded in [[2000 in sports|2000]] and [[2001 in sports|2001]], and the latter once more absorbed the gender-specific awards in [[2005 in sports|2005]].

During the award's three years, the voting panel comprised variously [[fan (aficionado)|fans]], who participated through [[Internet]] balloting; [[sports journalism|sportswriter]]s and [[Sports presenter|broadcasters]], sports [[corporate officer|executives]], and retired [[sportsperson]]s, termed collectively ''experts''; and [[List of ESPN personalities|ESPN personalities]].  The [[ESPY Awards#Ceremonies|ESPY Awards ceremony]] was conducted in June and awards conferred reflected performance and achievement over the twelve months previous to presentation.&lt;ref&gt;Because of the [[ESPY Awards#Timing|rescheduling]] of the ESPY Awards ceremony, the award presented in [[2002 in sports|2002]] was given in consideration of performance betwixt February [[2001 in sports|2001]] and June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Desert Sun Stadium''' is a [[soccer-specific  stadium]] in [[Yuma, Arizona]],  originally built for [[baseball]]. It was the home field of the [[North American League (baseball)|North American League]]'s [[Yuma Scorpions]] [[minor league]] baseball team and the [[Arizona Winter League]] and [[Arizona Summer League]].  The stadium, which originally opened in 1969, serves as the main field of the [[Ray Kroc Baseball Complex]].  It was the spring training home of the [[San Diego Padres]] from 1969 until 1994. [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE Wrestling]] occasionally makes a stop at the baseball complex as well. In 2015, Desert Sun Stadium was converted to a soccer stadium by OneGoal LLC, an organization that paid for the $15,000 conversion fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Holly|last=Sweet|title=Yuma City Council to approve Desert Sun Stadium contract|work=[[KYMA]] [[KSWT]] [[KECY]] News|accessdate=March 12, 2015|date=March 4, 2015|url=http://www.kyma.com/yuma-city-council-to-approve-desert-sun-stadium-contract|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402140010/http://www.kyma.com/yuma-city-council-to-approve-desert-sun-stadium-contract|archive-date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frontera United]] has played at Desert Sun Stadium since 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1375">[[File:Dipexercise.svg|thumb|300px|frame|right|A dip bar being used to do the dip exercise.]]
A '''dip bar''' is a piece of [[Physical fitness|fitness]] equipment that consists of a U-shaped bar, usually about 1" (2.5 cm) in diameter, which surrounds the user's body at the waist. It is designed for the performance of, and named after, the [[dip exercise]].

In addition to this exercise, much like the [[trap bar]] can be used for [[deadlift]]s, a dip bar has other potential uses. It can, for example, be used to do [[handstand pushup]]s, or the forearms can lie on it to be used as a (probably less comfortable) [[captain's chair]] for doing things such as [[knee raise]]s. When dip bars have clearance under the handles, they also allow the exerciser to do things like [[hip abduction]] leg raises, to work muscles like the [[gluteus medius]].

Dip bars that are high enough can also be used via having the hands below the bar instead of on top of them, using the [[finger flexor]]s to hang on. They can be used to hold the very top motion of a pull-up (generally they are not high enough to allow significant range of motion in this movement, even if the knees are bent or pulled to the chest) as well as to perform [[supine row]]s.

'''Drake Stadium''' was a [[stadium]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. Originally named '''Haskins Field''', for the son of a primary donor, stadium opened on October 8, 1904 with the University of Iowa winning 17–0 over Drake. The original name of the stadium was Haskins Field, but it was changed to Drake Stadium{{when|date=June 2017}} at the request of the Haskins.{{CN|date=June 2017}} This is not to be confused with the current [[Drake Stadium (Drake University)|Drake Stadium]] built in 1925. 

In 1907, renovations occurred that added seating, bringing the total to 6,700 and a drainage system was also added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.godrakebulldogs.com/fls/15700/pdf/2009DrakeTrack_Low.pdf | title=2008-09 DRAKE MEN’S &amp; WOMEN’S TRACK &amp; FIELD/CROSS COUNTRY MEDIA GUIDE | author=Drake University | publisher=Drake University | year=2009 | accessdate=2011-01-08 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haskins Field was originally expected to be able to hold 40,000 fans if expanded to its maximum capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.drake.edu/oncampus/vol58-no32-041706/ | title=On Campus: It adds up: Drake Stadium quantified | author=Drake University | publisher=Drake University | date=2006-04-16 | accessdate=2011-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Essex Memorial Arena''' was an ice-hockey [[arena]] in [[Essex, Ontario]], Canada constructed in 1960-1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://windsorstar.com/news/essex-memorial-arena-demolition-under-way|title=Essex Memorial Arena demolition under way|date=2015-07-24|work=Windsor Star|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://windsorstar.com/news/essex-memorial-arena-demolition-under-way|title=Essex Memorial Arena demolition under way|date=2015-07-24|work=Windsor Star|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity of the Essex Memorial Arena was 1,501 and it served as the home ice for the [[Essex 73's]] of the [[Great Lakes Junior C Hockey League]] from 1973–2009. During that time the 73's won 16 Great Lakes League Championships and 6 Ontario Junior C titles, The 2008–2009 season was to be the final year for the 73's at the Essex Memorial Arena and in that year the 73's captured the Ontario Junior C crown finishing with a perfect 31-0 record in the arena. A replacement arena was completed in September 2009. Various groups including Essex Minor Hockey continued to use the arena until it was demolished in the summer of 2015.

==History==
The first records mentioning the potential of an artificial rink for Essex are from the mid-1950s. The idea grew and by March 1956 the Parks Board created an Arena Committee, which it named the ''Essex Memorial Arena Campaign Committee'', and appointed members from the Essex [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]], the [[Royal Canadian Legion|Legion (Branch 201)]], and the Kinsmen Club of Essex. The Kinsmen Club of Essex were the first to initiate a challenge to the town to raise $50,000. The name of the arena was one of the first issues addressed. It was decided that it would be called Essex Memorial Arena in honour of the men who had fought and died in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

==Indoor Design==
The first arena proposed by the committee was an outdoor arena. An outdoor arena could only function from December 1 to April 15. The design allowed for the easy addition of a roof at a later time. The committee soon changed the original proposal from an outdoor arena to a closed arena due to the long-term economic benefit. It was $15,000 more expensive for the freezing equipment for an outdoor rink than for an indoor rink, and the utility costs for the outdoor rink would have been much higher. Another bonus to having an indoor rink was the longer skating season; 6 months compared to 4½.  With 10,000 people in the area surrounding Essex the indoor option would increase revenue to easily pay for up front extra cost for an indoor arena.

==Completing the construction==
The Essex community was not completely supportive of the arena building project. They feared the arena would increase water rates in town, and that the arena was an unsafe structure. By the final stages of construction funds were drying up and $100,000 would be needed to complete it. On June 19, 1961 the town went to the polls to settle the issue, voting 551 to 392 in favour of the arena loan. The loan was obtained and the building was completed within the year. The walls were made of 12" (30.5&amp;nbsp;cm) thick reinforced masonry blocks.  The roof is supported by eleven trusses. The arena has heated dressing rooms, a canteen and 1054 seats. It took 937 days to fully complete the arena. The Essex Memorial Arena Campaign Committee was then dissolved and the town took control and created an Arena Commission.

The arena officially opened on November 25, 1961.

==Decommission and Demolition==
In the early 2000s the deterioration of the southeast corner of the arena forced an emergency closure for repair work. This, along with the shortage of ice time in Essex Centre prompted Essex to build a new arena which was completed for the 2009-10 hockey season. Despite the completion of the new Essex Centre Sports Complex next to the Essex Memorial Arena the older structure continued to be used for hockey for a time. In August 2011 Essex and [[Lakeshore, Ontario]] agreed to keep the arena open until 2014 when Lakeshore's own new arena would be completed. With some roof repairs the arena remained open until the end of the 2014-15 hockey season. The arena was demolished in the summer of 2015.

The '''International Basketball Federation''', more commonly known as '''FIBA''', '''FIBA World''', or '''FIBA International''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|b|ə}} {{Respell|FEE|bə}}), from its French name {{lang|fr|Fédération internationale de basket-ball}}, is an association of national organizations which governs [[international]] competition in [[basketball]]. Originally known as the {{lang|fr|Fédération internationale de basket-ball amateur}} (hence FIBA), in 1989 it dropped the word ''amateur'' from its official name but retained the acronym; the "BA" now represents the first two letters of ''basketball''.

FIBA defines the international [[rules of basketball]], specifies the equipment and facilities required, regulates the transfer of athletes across countries, and controls the appointment of international [[Official (basketball)|referees]]. A total of 213 national federations are now members, organized since 1989 into five zones or "commissions": [[FIBA Africa|Africa]], [[FIBA Americas|Americas]], [[FIBA Asia|Asia]], [[FIBA Europe|Europe]], and [[FIBA Oceania|Oceania]].

The [[FIBA Basketball World Cup]] is a world tournament for men's national teams held every four years. Teams compete for the [[Naismith Trophy]], named in honor of basketball's Canadian creator [[James Naismith]]. The tournament structure is similar but not identical to that of the [[FIFA World Cup]] in football; these tournaments occurred in the same year from 1970 through 2014, but starting in [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2019]], the Basketball World Cup will move to the year following the FIFA World Cup. A parallel event for women's teams, the [[FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup]], is also held quadrennially; from 1986 through 2014, it was held in the same year as the men's event but in a different country. The women's tournament will continue to be held in the same year as the FIFA World Cup.

In 2009 FIBA announced three new tournaments: two 12-team U-17 World Championships (one each for men and women) to be played in July 2010, and an eight-team FIBA World Club Championship to be launched in October 2010. However, the FIBA World Club Championship did not materialize. In its place, FIBA instead relaunched its original world club championship for men, the [[FIBA Intercontinental Cup]], in 2013.

The newest worldwide FIBA tournaments for national teams are in the three-player half-court variation, [[3x3 (basketball)|3x3]]. The [[FIBA 3x3 U-18 World Championships]] were inaugurated in 2011, and the [[FIBA 3x3 World Championships]] for senior teams followed a year later. All events initially included separate tournaments for men's, women's, and mixed teams, but mixed championships are no longer contested. The U-18 championships, held annually, feature 32 teams in each individual tournament. The senior championships have 24 teams in each individual tournament, and are held in even-numbered years.

[[File:FIBALogoOld.png|thumb|150px|left|Old FIBA logo.]]
[[File:World Map FIBA.svg|thumb|250px|FIBA divides the world into 5 commissions, each roughly based on a continent.]]
[[File:FIBA headquarter.JPG|thumb|250px|FIBA in Mies.]]

The association was founded in [[Geneva]] in 1932, two years after the sport was officially recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]. Its original name was {{lang|fr|Fédération internationale de basket-ball amateur}}. Eight nations were founding members:  [[Argentine Basketball Federation|Argentina]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Greece]], [[Italian Basketball Federation|Italy]], [[Latvia]], [[Federação Portuguesa de Basquetebol|Portugal]], [[Romania]], and [[Switzerland]]. During the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Berlin]], the Federation named [[James Naismith]] (1861–1939), the founder of [[basketball]], as its Honorary President.

FIBA has organized a World Championship, now known as [[FIBA Basketball World Cup|World Cup]], for men since 1950 and a Women's World Championship, now known as the [[FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup|Women's World Cup]], since 1953. From 1986 through 2014, both events were held every four years, alternating with the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympics]]. As noted above, the men's World Cup will be moved to a new four-year cycle, with tournaments in the year before the Summer Olympics, after 2014.

The Federation headquarters moved to [[Munich]] in 1956, then returned to Geneva in 2002. In 1991, it founded the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]]; the first induction ceremony was held on 12 September 2007, during [[EuroBasket 2007]]. During its 81st anniversary in 2013, FIBA moved into its new headquarters, "The House of Basketball", at [[Mies]]. TBA is the current Secretary General of FIBA.

}}

'''Figure skating''' is a sport in which individuals, duos, or groups perform on [[figure skate]]s on ice. It was the first winter sport included in the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], in [[Figure skating at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908]].&lt;ref name=AFS2014/&gt; The four Olympic disciplines are [[Single skating|men's singles, ladies' singles]], [[pair skating]], and [[ice dance]]. Non-Olympic disciplines include [[synchronized skating]], [[Ice theatre|Theater on Ice]], and [[four skating]]. From novice through senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs ([[Short program (figure skating)|short]] and [[Free skating|free skating]]) which, depending on the discipline, may include [[figure skating spins|spins]], [[figure skating jumps|jumps]], [[moves in the field]], [[Figure skating lifts|lifts]], [[Figure skating jumps#Throw jumps|throw jumps]], [[death spiral (figure skating)|death spiral]]s, and other elements or moves.

The blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct [[Glossary of figure skating terms|edges]]: inside and outside. Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on both at the same time, which is referred to as a flat edge. During a spin, skaters use the "sweet spot" of the blade, formally called a rocker, which is the roundest portion of the blade, just behind the pick and near the middle of the blade. Skates used in single and pair skating have a set of large, jagged teeth called toe picks on the front of the blade. Toe picks are mainly used for the take-off on jumps. Ice dance blades are an inch shorter in the rear and have smaller toe picks.

Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level (senior) at local, regional, national, and international competitions. The [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) regulates international figure skating judging and competitions. These include the [[Figure skating at the Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]], the [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]], the [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championships]], the [[European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]], the [[Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|Four Continents Championships]], the Grand Prix series ([[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|senior]] and [[ISU Junior Grand Prix|junior]]), and the [[ISU Challenger Series]].

The sport is also associated with show business. Major competitions generally conclude with exhibition galas, in which the top skaters from each discipline perform non-competitive programs. Many skaters, both during and after their competitive careers, also skate in ice shows, which run during the competitive season and the off-season.

== Terminology ==
[[File:NSAPINY9 EXTR.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|An 1862 lithograph depicting skating in the 19th century]]
The term "professional" in skating refers not to skill level but competitive status. Figure skaters competing at the highest levels of international competition are not "professional" skaters. They are sometimes referred to as amateurs,&lt;ref name=USAT110315/&gt; though some earn money. Professional skaters include those who have lost their ISU eligibility and those who perform only in shows. They may include former Olympic and World champions who have ended their competitive career as well as skaters with little or no international competitive experience.

In languages other than English, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Italian, Polish and Russian, figure skating is usually referred to by a name that translates as "artistic skating."

== Figure skates ==
{{Main article|Figure skate}}
[[File:Figure-skates-2.jpg|thumb|Close-up of a figure skating blade, showing the ''toe picks'', the ''hollow'' (groove) on bottom surface of blade, and screw attachment to the boot]]

The most visible difference in relation to [[ice hockey]] skates is that figure skates have a set of large, jagged teeth called ''toe picks'' on the front part of the blade. These are used primarily in jumping and should not be used for stroking or spins. If used during a spin, the toe pick will cause the skater to lose momentum, or move away from the center of the spin. Blades are mounted to the sole and heel of the boot with screws. Typically, high-level figure skaters are professionally fitted for their boots and blades at a reputable skate shop. Professionals are also employed to sharpen blades to individual requirements.&lt;ref name=NYT090622/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-79630-0003, Bodo Bockenauer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Blade sharpening]]
Blades are about 3/16&amp;nbsp;inch ({{nowrap|4.7 mm}}) thick. When viewed from the side, the blade of a figure skate is not flat, but curved slightly, forming an arc of a circle with a [[radius]] of {{nowrap|180–220 cm}}. This curvature is referred to as the ''rocker'' of the blade. The "sweet spot" is the part of the blade on which all spins are rotated; this is usually located near the [[stanchion]] of the blade, below the ball of the foot.&lt;ref name=fsequip/&gt; The blade is also "hollow ground"; a groove on the bottom of the blade creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. The '''inside edge''' of the blade is on the side closest to the skater; the '''outside edge''' of the blade is on the side farthest from the skater. In figure skating, it is always desirable to skate on only one edge of the blade. Skating on both at the same time (which is referred to as a ''flat'') may result in lower skating skills scores. The apparently effortless power and glide across the ice exhibited by elite figure skaters fundamentally derives from [[Conservation of angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|efficient use of the edges to generate speed]].

Ice dancers' blades are about an inch shorter in the rear than those used by skaters in other disciplines, to accommodate the intricate footwork and close partnering in dance. Dancers' blades also have a smaller toe pick as they do not require the large toe pick used for jumping in the other disciplines. Hard plastic ''skate guards'' are used when the skater must walk in his or her skates when not on the ice, to protect the blade from dirt or material on the ground that may dull the blade. Soft blade covers called ''soakers'' are used to absorb condensation and protect the blades from rust when the skates are not being worn. In competition, skaters are allowed three minutes to make repairs to their skates.

Off-ice training is the term for physical conditioning that takes place off the ice. Besides regular physical exercise, skaters do walk-throughs of jumps off the ice in order to practice sufficient rotation and height of their jumps, and to practice consistency in landing on one foot.

== Ice rinks and rink equipment ==
{{Main article|Figure skating rink}}
There is significant variation in the dimensions of ice rinks. Olympic-sized rinks have dimensions of {{convert|30|x|60|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}, [[National Hockey League|NHL]]-sized rinks are {{convert|26|x|61|m|abbr=on}}, while European rinks are sometimes {{convert|30|x|64|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=aboutrinks/&gt; The [[International Skating Union|ISU]] prefers Olympic-sized rinks for figure skating competitions, particularly for major events. According to ISU rule 342, a figure skating rink for an ISU event "if possible, shall measure sixty (60) meters in one direction and thirty (30) meters in the other, but not larger, and not less than fifty-six (56) meters in one direction and twenty-six (26) meters in the other."&lt;ref name=isuSFTR/&gt; The scoring system rewards skaters who have good ice coverage, i.e. those who efficiently cover the entire ice surface during their programs. Olympic-sized rinks make the differences in skill between skaters more apparent but they are not available for all events. If a rink has different dimensions, a skater's jump setup and speed may be hindered as he or she adjusts.&lt;ref name=AP111022/&gt;&lt;ref name=IN131007/&gt;

Ice quality is judged by smoothness, friction, hardness, and brittleness.&lt;ref name=WMQI1105/&gt; Factors affecting ice quality include temperature, water quality, and usage, with toe picks causing more deterioration. For figure skating, the ice surface temperature is normally maintained between {{convert|-5.5|C|F}} and {{convert|-3.5|C|F}},&lt;ref name=WMQI1105/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olympic.org161031"/&gt; with the Olympic disciplines requiring slightly softer ice (−3.5 °C) than synchronized skating (−5.5 °C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usfsa.org/content/ISU%20SYS%20Handbook%20for%20Referees.pdf|title=Handbook for Referees − Synchronized Skating − Season 2018−2019|page=44|date=July 28, 2018|publisher=[[International Skating Union|ISU]]|access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically after every two warm-up groups, an [[ice resurfacer]] cleans and smooths the surface of the ice sheet. Inadequate ice quality may affect skaters' performances.&lt;ref name=GS120328ps/&gt;

Some rinks have a harness system installed to help skaters learn new jumps in a controlled manner. A heavy-duty cable is securely attached to two of the walls around the ice, with a set of pulleys riding on the cable. The skater wears a vest or belt, with a cable or rope attached to it, and the cable/rope is threaded through the movable pulley on the cable above. The coach holds the other end of the cable and lifts the skater by pulling the cable/rope. The skater can then practice the jump with the coach assisting the completion.

== Disciplines ==

=== Olympic disciplines ===
As an Olympic sport, figure skating comprises the following disciplines:&lt;ref name=olympic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/disciplines_uk.asp?DiscCode=FS|title=Figure skating at Olympic.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020404075359/http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/disciplines_uk.asp?DiscCode=FS|archive-date=April 4, 2002|dead-url=yes|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]|access-date=November 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Single skating|Singles]]''' competition for men and women (referred to as "ladies" in ISU rulebooks), wherein individual skaters perform [[figure skating jump|jumps]], [[figure skating spin|spins]], [[step sequence]]s, [[Figure skating spirals|spirals]], and other elements in their programs.
*'''[[Pair skating]]''' teams, consisting of a man and a woman skating together. Pairs perform elements that are specific to the discipline such as: [[Figure skating jumps#Jumps in pair skating|throw jumps]], in which the man 'throws' the woman into a jump; [[Figure skating lifts#Pair lifts|lifts]], in which the woman is held above the man's head in one of various grips and positions; [[Figure skating spins#Pair skating and ice dancing|pair spins]], in which both skaters spin together about a common axis; [[Death spiral (figure skating)|death spiral]]s; and other elements such as side-by-side jumps and spins in unison.
*'''[[Ice dance]]''' is again for couples consisting of a woman and a man skating together. In contrast to pair skating, ice dance focuses on intricate footwork performed in close dance holds, in time with the music. [[Figure skating lifts#Dance lifts|Ice dance lifts]] must not go above the shoulder, and throws and jumps are disallowed.

The four disciplines of men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating and ice dance are also incorporated into a team event, which appeared on the Olympic program for the first time at the [[Figure skating at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Team trophy|2014 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=reu110406/&gt;

=== Other disciplines ===

[[File:Haydenettes2013-01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Lifts performed by the [[Haydenettes]], 26-time U.S. national synchro champions]]
*'''[[Synchronized skating]]''', formerly known as "precision skating", is for mixed-gender groups of between twelve and twenty figure skaters. This discipline resembles a group form of ice dance, with additional emphasis on precise formations of the group as a whole and complex transitions between formations. The basic formations include wheels, blocks, lines, circles, and intersections. The close formations, and the need for the team to stay in unison, add to the difficulty of the footwork performed by the skaters in these elements. A formal proposal for inclusion in the Olympics was submitted by the [[International Skating Union|ISU]] to the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in September 2014.&lt;ref name=CT140929/&gt;
*'''[[Ice theatre]]''', also known as "Theatre on Ice" (or "Ballet on Ice" in Europe), is a form of group skating that is less structured than synchronized skating and allows the use of theatrical costuming and [[Theatrical property|props]].
*'''[[Four skating]]''' is a discipline in which a team of four skaters, consisting of two men and two women, perform singles and pairs elements in unison, as well as unique elements that involve all four skaters.
*'''[[Special figures]]''' is the tracing of elaborate original designs on the ice. This was a common discipline in the early days of figure skating (hence the name of the sport) and appeared once at the Olympics, in [[Figure skating at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908]].
*'''Adagio skating''' is a form of pair skating most commonly seen in ice shows, where the skaters perform many acrobatic lifts, but few or none of the other elements that are performed by competitive pair skaters.
*'''Acrobatic skating''', also known as "Acrobatics on ice" or "Extreme skating", is a combination of circus arts, technical artistic gymnastics skills, and figure skating.

== Elements and moves ==
{{Main article|Glossary of figure skating terms}}

Each element receives a score according to its base value and grade of execution (GOE), resulting in a combined technical elements score (TES). At competitions, a technical specialist identifies the elements and assigns each one a level of difficulty, ranging from B (Basic) to Level 4 (most difficult).&lt;ref name=isu2168/&gt; For each element, a panel of judges determines the GOE, ranging between –5 and +5, according to how well the skater executes the element. The GOE is weighted according to the base value of the element.&lt;ref name=isu2168/&gt;

The ISU defines a fall as a loss of control with the result that the majority of the skater's body weight is not on the blade but supported by hands, knees, or buttocks.&lt;ref name=deduc/&gt;

[[File:Figure Skating.webmhd.webm|thumb|Video demonstrating figure skating jumps]]
Jumps involve the skater leaping into the air and rotating rapidly to land after completing one or more rotations. There are many types of jumps, identified by the way the skater takes off and lands, as well as by the number of rotations that are completed.

Each jump receives a score according to its base value and grade of execution (GOE).&lt;ref name=isu2168/&gt; Quality of execution, technique, height, speed, flow and ice coverage are considered by the judges. An ''under-rotated'' jump (indicated by &lt; ) is "missing rotation of more than ¼, but less than ½ revolution" and receives 70% of the base value. A ''downgraded'' jump (indicated by &lt;&lt;) is "missing rotation of ½ revolution or more". A downgraded triple is treated as a double jump, while a downgraded double is treated as a single jump.

An edge violation occurs when a skater executes a jump on the incorrect edge. The hollow is a groove on the bottom of the blade which creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. The inside edge of the blade is on the side closest to the skater, the outside edge is on the side farthest from the skater, and a ''flat'' refers to skating on both edges at the same time, which is discouraged. An unclear edge or edge violation is indicated with an 'e' and reflected in the GOE according to the severity of the problem. ''Flutz'' and ''lip'' are the colloquial terms for a Lutz and flip jump with an edge violation.

In 1982, the [[International Skating Union|ISU]] enacted a rule stating that a skater may perform each type of triple only once in a program, or twice if one of them is incorporated into a combination or sequence. For a set of jumps to be considered a ''combination'', each jump must take off from the landing edge of the previous jump, with no steps, turns, or change of edge in between jumps. Toe loops and loops are commonly performed as the second or third jump in a combination because they take off from the back outside edge of the landing foot, or skating [[leg]]. To perform a salchow or flip on the back end of a combination, a half loop (which is actually a full rotation, but lands on a back inside edge of the landing leg) may be used as a connecting jump. In contrast, jump ''sequences'' are sets of jumps which may be linked by non-listed jumps or hops.&lt;ref name=tphss/&gt; Sequences are worth 80% of the combined value of the same jumps executed in combination.

A figure skater only needs to be able to jump in one direction, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. The vast majority of figure skaters prefer to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction when jumping. Thus, for clarity, all jumps will be described for a skater jumping counter-clockwise.

There are six jumps in figure skating that count as jump elements. All six are landed on one foot on the back [[figure skate#Blades|outside edge]] (with counter-clockwise rotation, for single and multi-revolution jumps), but have different takeoffs, by which they may be distinguished. The two categories of jumps are toe jumps and edge jumps.

The number of rotations performed in the air determines whether the jump is a single, double, triple, or quadruple (commonly known as a "[[Quad (figure skating)|quad]]"). The simplest jump begins with a waltz jump which can only be done in a half-leap and is not classified as a single, double, or triple jump. Senior-level male single skaters perform mostly triple and quadruple jumps in competition. Triple jumps other than the Axel are commonly performed by female single skaters. It is extremely rare for a female skater to land a quadruple jump; the only two female single skaters to be credited with quads in competition are [[Miki Ando]], who landed the first quad Salchow [[2002–03 ISU Junior Grand Prix|in Dec 2002]], and [[Alexandra Trusova]], who landed the first quad Toe Loop (and only the second quad Salchow) [[2018 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|in March 2018]], both at the Junior level. Alexandra Trusova also was the first female to ever land 2 quadruple jumps in competition, the quad salchow and the quad toe loop. She was only 13 years old at the time.

Some elite skaters can complete a jump in about one second, with 26 inches of height and 10 feet in distance.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The takeoff speed of a jump can reach up to 15&amp;nbsp;mph.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==== Toe jumps ====
Toe jumps are launched by digging the toe pick of one skate into the ice, using it to vault into the air with the opposite leg. The main toe jumps are (in order of score value):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jumps|publisher=Holland Ice Academy|url=http://hollandiceacademy.com/en/jumps|access-date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Toe loop jump|Toe loop]] – the skater takes off backwards from the outside edge of the right (or left) foot, launching the jump using the opposite toe pick.
# [[Flip jump|Flip]] (sometimes known as a Toe Salchow) – the skater takes off backwards from the inside edge of the left (or right) foot and assists the take-off using the opposite toe pick.
# [[Lutz jump|Lutz]] – similar to the flip, but the skater takes off from the backward ''outside'' edge of the left (or right) foot, launching the jump using the opposite toe pick.

All of the above descriptions assume a counter-clockwise direction of rotation, landing backwards on the outside edge of the right foot. (For clockwise rotation, the skater takes off using the alternative foot and lands backwards on the outside edge of the left foot.)

==== Edge jumps ====
[[File:Axel Paulsen jump without text.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|An axel jump]]
Edge jumps use no toe assist, and include (in order of score value):
# [[Salchow jump|Salchow]] – the skater takes off backwards from the inside edge of the left (or right) foot, allowing the edge to come round, the opposite leg helps to launch the jump into the air.
# [[Loop jump|Loop]] (also known as a Rittberger jump) – the skater takes off backwards from the outside edge of the right (or left) foot.
# [[Axel jump|Axel]] – the skater takes off forwards from the outside edge of the left (or right) foot. As this is the only rotating jump to take off from a forward edge, it includes an extra half rotation.

Again, these descriptions assume a counter-clockwise direction of rotation, landing backwards on the outside edge of the right foot. (For clockwise rotation, the skater takes off using the alternative foot and always lands backwards on the outside edge of the left foot.)

==== Other jumps ====
There are also a number of other jumps that are usually performed only as single jumps and in elite skating are used as transitional movements or highlights in step sequences. These include the half toe loop (ballet jump), half loop, half flip, [[walley jump]], [[waltz jump]], inside Axel, one-foot Axel, and [[split jump]]. There are two kinds of split jump:
* Russian split, performed in a position that is similar to that of a straddle split
* ladies split, performed in the position of the more traditional split, facing the direction of the front leg

=== Spins ===
{{Main article|Figure skating spins}}

Spins are a required element in all four Olympic disciplines. There are three basic positions – upright, sit and camel – with numerous variations.

* '''Upright spin''' variations include layback, Biellmann, haircutter, layover layback, attitude, and pearl.
* '''Sit spin''' variations include pancake, broken leg, tuck behind, cannonball, flying, and clam.
* '''Camel spin''' variations include catch-foot, layover, flying, and donut.

Spins may be performed individually or in a spin sequence, combining different types of spin; a spin sequence is known as a "combination spin". During a spin, the skater rotates on the front rocker (sometimes called the "sweet spot" or "spin rocker"), which is the curved part of the blade that corresponds to the ball of the skater's foot, just behind the toe pick. A spin may be executed on the back rocker of the blade during a change of edge spin. For example, a back scratch spin will flip edges to a forward inside edge. This feature of a spin will change the level of a spin.

A figure skater only needs to be able to spin in one direction, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Most skaters favor a counter-clockwise direction of rotation when spinning (as in jumping), but there are some skaters who prefer to spin in the clockwise direction. A small minority of skaters are able to spin in both directions. Spins may be performed on either foot. For skaters who rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, a spin on the left foot is called a forward spin, while a spin on the right foot is called a back spin. The opposite applies for skaters who rotate in a clockwise direction. When learning to spin, a skater will typically learn a forward spin first, then once that is mastered they will learn how to execute a back spin.

When performing some types of spin, an elite skater can complete on average six rotations per second, and up to 70 rotations in a single spin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Frozen Teardrop: The Tragedy and Triumph of Figure Skating's Queen of Spin|url=https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781590792131|isbn=9781590792131|author=Lucinda Ruh|publisher=SelectBooks|date=November 2011|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is rarely seen in modern competitions because it would gain no extra points for the spin.

Spins are normally entered on the ice, but they can also be entered from a jump or sequence of jumps known as star jumps. Spins that are entered through a jump are calling flying spins; these include the flying camel, flying sit spin, death drop, and butterfly spin. Flying spins may go from a forward spin to a back spin and they can also be performed as part of a spin sequence (combination spin).

In pair skating, spins may be performed side-by-side with both partners doing the same spin or combination spin simultaneously. Additionally, in pairs and in ice dance, there are pair spins and dance spins, during which both skaters rotate around the same axis while holding onto one another.

=== Lifts ===
{{Main article|Figure skating lifts}}
[[File:Maria Mukhortova and Maxim Trankov at 2010 European Championships (3).jpg|right|thumb|A one arm overhead lift in pair skating]]
Lifts are a required element in [[pair skating]] and [[ice dance]].

==== Pair lifts ====
Pair lifts are generally overhead. According to the current ISU rules for senior-level competition, the man must rotate more than once, but fewer than three-and-a-half times. In competitive pair skating, lifts must travel across the ice to be included in the technical elements score (TES); stationary lifts are included in choreography. Pair lifts are grouped by the holds involved.

Legal holds:
* ''Armpit holds'' are not generally used in elite senior competition.
* ''Waist holds''
* ''Hand-to-hip holds''
* ''Hand-to-hand'' lifts are divided into two types: 
**''Press'' lifts 
**''Lasso'' lifts, in order of increasing difficulty:&lt;ref name=isu2168/&gt;
*** Toe or step in lasso
*** Axel or backward lasso
*** Reverse lasso

The judges look at speed, ice coverage, the quality of the lady's position, position changes, and the man's stability and cleanness of turns throughout. Skaters may also raise their score by having a difficult entry such as in spiral or spread eagle position, a difficult exit, or other features such as stopping the rotation, turning a carry lift into rotational one, or reversing rotation (i.e. both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions). This gives the lifts a level. They can be from a base level to a level 4. The higher the level, the more points the skaters can receive. 

'''Twist lifts''' are a form of pair lifts, where the lifted partner is thrown into the air, twists, and is caught by the lifted partner. The lady is caught by her waist in the air and lands on the backward outside edge. Some pairs include a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is separated by at least a 45° angle from the body axis and the legs are straight or almost straight. Scores are also affected by the height of the twist, turns, steps or other moves before the element, the lady holding her arms over her head, delayed rotation, etc. This element is also a leveled element. 

==== Dance lifts ====
Ice dancers are not allowed to lift their partners above their shoulders. Dance lifts are separated into ''short lifts'' and ''long lifts''. There are many positions each partner can take to raise the difficulty of a lift. Each position must be held for at least three seconds to count and is permitted only once in a program.

'''Short lifts''' may last up to six seconds in competition on the senior level.
*''Stationary lift'' – A lift performed "on the spot". The lifting partner does not move across the ice, but is allowed to rotate.
*''Straight line lift'' – The lifting partner moves in a straight line across the ice. This lift may be performed on one foot or two.
*''Curve lift'' – The lifting partner moves along a curve across the ice. This lift may be performed on one foot or two.
*''Rotational lift'' – The lifting partner rotates in one direction while traveling across the ice.

'''Long lifts''' may last up to ten seconds in competition on the senior level.
*''Reverse rotational lift'' – The lifting partner rotates in one direction, then switches and rotates in the other direction, while traveling across the ice.
*''Serpentine lift'' – The lifting partner moves in a serpentine pattern across the ice. 
*''Combination lift'' – A lift combining two of the four short lifts. Each part of the lift must be fully established.

In both pairs and dance, lifts that go on longer than allowed receive deductions.

=== Turns, steps, moves in the field, and other moves ===
Step sequences are a required element in all four Olympic disciplines. The pattern can be straight line, circular, or serpentine. The step sequence consists of a combination of turns, steps, hops and edge changes. Additionally, steps and turns can be used as transitions between elements. The various turns, which skaters can incorporate into step sequences, include:

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Threeturn.GIF | [[3 turn|Three turns]], so called because the blade turns into the curve of the edge or lobe to leave a tracing resembling the numeral "3".
File:Bracket.GIF | [[Bracket turn]]s, in which the blade is turned counter to the curve of the lobe, making a tracing resembling a bracket ("}").
File:Mohawk-trace.png | [[Mohawk turn|Mohawk]]s, the two-foot equivalents of three turns and brackets.
File:Rocker turn.gif | [[Rocker turn|Rockers]], one-foot turns that involve a change of lobe as well as of direction.
File:Counter.GIF | [[Counter turn|Counters]], one-foot turns that involve a change of lobe as well as of direction.
File:2011 WFSC 2d 259 Siobhan Heekin-Canedy Alexander Shakalov.JPG | [[Twizzle]]s, traveling multi-rotation turns on one foot
&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Choctaw turn|Choctaw]]s are the two-foot equivalents of rockers and counters. Other movements that may be incorporated into step sequences or used as connecting elements include lunges and [[spread eagle (figure skating)|spread eagles]]. An [[Ina Bauer (element)|Ina Bauer]] is similar to a spread eagle performed with one knee bent and typically an arched back. [[Hydroblading]] refers to a deep edge performed with the body as low as possible to the ice in a near-horizontal position.

[[Moves in the field]] emphasize basic skating skill and edge control. In the context of a competitive program, they include [[spiral (figure skating)|spirals]], [[spread eagle (figure skating)|spread eagles]], [[Ina Bauer (element)|Ina Bauers]], [[hydroblading]], and similar extended edge moves.

A spiral is an element in which the skater moves across the ice on a specific edge with the free leg held at hip level or above. Spirals are distinguished by the edge of the blade used (inside or outside), the direction of motion (forward or backward), and the skater's position. A spiral sequence is one or more spiral positions and edges done in sequence. Judges look at the depth, stability, and control of the skating edge, speed and ice coverage, extension, and other factors. Some skaters are able to change edges during a spiral, i.e. from inside to outside edge. Spirals performed on a "flat" are generally not considered as true spirals. Spiral sequences were required in ladies' and pair skating prior to the 2012–13 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jsfresults.com/data/fs/pdfs/comm/comm1672e.pdf|title=Communication No. 1672 – Single &amp; Pair Skating – Amendments to the Scale of Values, Guidelines for marking Grade of Execution and Levels of Difficulty, season 2011–2012|date=May 5, 2011|publisher=[[International Skating Union|ISU]]|access-date=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but from the [[2012–13 figure skating season|2012–13 season]] onward, they were replaced by the choreographic sequence. The choreographic sequence consists of moves in the field, unlisted jumps, spinning movements, etc. and is required for the men's, ladies' and pair free program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usfigureskating.org/content/TN%20103%20Singles%20Choreographic%20Sequence%206%2021%2012.pdf|title=Technical Notification 103|date=June 21, 2012|publisher=[[U.S. Figure Skating]]|access-date=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isu.org/inside-single-pair-skating-ice-dance/isu-judging-system-fs/isu-handbooks-faq-sandp-skating-2/17594-tp-handbook-singles-2018-19/file|title=ISU Judging System − Technical Panel Handbook − Single Skating − 2018/2019|page=5|date=July 19, 2018|publisher=[[International Skating Union|ISU]]|access-date=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isu.org/inside-single-pair-skating-ice-dance/isu-judging-system-fs/isu-handbooks-faq-sandp-skating-2/17595-tp-handbook-pair-skating-2018-19/file|title=ISU Judging System − Technical Panel Handbook − Pair Skating − 2018/2019|page=5|date=July 19, 2018|publisher=[[International Skating Union|ISU]]|access-date=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Death spiral (figure skating)|death spiral]] is a required element of pair skating. There are four varieties distinguished by the lady's edge and direction of motion. The man performs a [[Glossary of figure skating terms#P|pivot]], one toe anchored in the ice, while holding the hand of his partner, who circles him on a deep edge with her body almost parallel to the ice. As of 2011, the woman's head must at some time reach her skating knee. The man must also be in a full pivot position and the death spiral must be held for a minimum amount of rotation, depending on the level.

=== Compulsory figures ===
[[Compulsory figures]] involves using the blades of the figure skates to draw circles, figure eights, and similar shapes on the surface of the ice. Skaters are judged on the accuracy and clarity of the figures and the cleanness and exact placement of the various turns on the circles. Figures were formerly included as a component of singles competitions but were eliminated from international events in 1990.&lt;ref name=CBS981216/&gt; The [[United States]] was the last country to retain a separate test and competitive structure for compulsory figures, but the last national-level figures championship was held in 1999. "Moves in the field" (known in the [[United Kingdom]] as ''field moves'') replaced compulsory figures as a discipline to teach the same turns and edge skills.

The World Figure Sport Society, based in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid, NY]], hosts an annual World Figure Championship, which was first held in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://worldfigurechampionship.com/news/world-figure-championship-figure-festival-coming-to-lake-placid-ny|title=World Figure Championship &amp; Figure Festival coming to Lake Placid, NY|format=Press release|date=April 25, 2015|access-date=November 24, 2018|publisher=World Figure Sport Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event acts to preserve the historic origins of figure skating, offering a perfect black ice surface on which the compulsory figures competition is held.

The [[International Skating Union|ISU]] is the governing body for international competitions in figure skating, including the World Championships and the figure skating events at the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. [[Medal]]s are awarded for overall results; the standard medals are [[Gold medal|gold]] for first place, [[Silver medal|silver]] for second, and [[Bronze medal|bronze]] for third place. [[U.S. Figure Skating]] also awards [[pewter]] medals for fourth-place finishers in national events. Additionally, at the World, European, Four Continents, and World Junior Championships, the ISU awards ''small medals'' for segment results (short and free program). A medal is generally attributed to only one country, even if a partnership is composed of skaters with different nationalities. A notable exception was the pair skating partnership between [[Ludowika Eilers]] and [[Walter Jakobsson]]; their 1910–11 medals were attributed to both Germany and Finland.&lt;ref name=WCP/&gt; Beyond the early 20th century, no skaters have been allowed to represent two countries in the same competition.

In singles and pairs figure skating competition, competitors perform two programs: the [[Short program (figure skating)|short program]], in which they complete a set of required elements consisting of jumps, spins and steps; and the [[Free skating|free skate]], also known as the ''long program'', in which they have a slightly wider choice of elements. Under both the 6.0 system and the ISU Judging System, the judges consider the "complete package" when evaluating performances, i.e. the best jumper is not always placed first if the judges consider the difference in jumping execution to be outweighed by another skater's speed, spins, presentation, etc.&lt;ref name=nyt970216/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS981202/&gt;

Ice dance competitions formerly consisted of three phases: one or more [[compulsory dance (ice dance)|compulsory dance]]s; an [[original dance]] to a [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]] rhythm that was designated annually; and a [[Free dance (figure skating)|free dance]] to music of the skaters' own choice. Beginning in the [[2010–2011 figure skating season|2010–11 season]], the compulsory and original dances were merged into the [[short dance]], which itself was renamed the ''[[rhythm dance]]'' in June 2018, prior to the [[2018–19 figure skating season|2018–19 season]].

===6.0 System===
{{Main article|6.0 system}}
Skating was formerly judged for "technical merit" (in the free skate), "required elements" (in the short program), and "presentation" (in both programs).&lt;ref name=CBS981202/&gt; The marks for each program ran from 0.0 to 6.0, the latter being the highest. These marks were used to determine a preference ranking, or "ordinal", separately for each judge; the judges' preferences were then combined to determine placements for each skater in each program. The placements for the two programs were then combined, with the free skate placement weighted more heavily than the short program. The highest placing individual (based on the sum of the weighted placements) was declared the winner.&lt;ref name=6.0&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usfsa.org/programs?id=84139|title=The 6.0 System|access-date=November 21, 2018|publisher=[[U.S. Figure Skating]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ISU Judging System===
{{Main article|ISU Judging System}}
In 2004, in response to the [[2002 Olympic Winter Games figure skating scandal|judging controversy]] during the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], the ISU adopted the International Judging System (IJS), which became mandatory at all international competitions in 2006, including the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. The new system is sometimes informally referred to as the ''Code of Points'', however, the ISU has never used the term to describe their system in any of their official communications.

Under the IJS, points are awarded individually for each skating element, and the sum of these points is the ''total element score'' (TES). Competitive programs are constrained to include a set number of elements. Each element is judged first by a technical specialist who identifies the specific element and determines its ''base value''. This is done using instant replay video to verify features that distinguish different elements; e.g. the exact foot position at take-off and landing of a jump. A panel of twelve judges then each award a mark for the quality and execution of the element. This mark, called the ''grade of execution'' (GOE), is an integer with a minimum value of –5 and a maximum value of +5.&lt;ref name=isu2168/&gt; The GOE mark is then translated into another value by using the table of values in ISU rule 322. The GOE value from the twelve judges is then processed with a computerized random selection of nine judges, the highest and lowest values are then discarded, and finally the average of the remaining seven is calculated. This average value is then added to (or subtracted from) the base value to determine the total value for the element.&lt;ref name=judging/&gt;

Note: The IJS previously used a GOE scale of –3 to +3&lt;ref name="isu2089"/&gt; but this was changed for the [[2018–19 figure skating season|2018–19 season]] and is in the early stages of being tested in competitions.

The ''program components score'' (PCS) awards points to holistic aspects of a program or other nuances that are not rewarded in the ''total element score''. The components are:&lt;ref name=components/&gt;
# Skating skills (SS) reward use of edges and turns, flow over the ice surface, speed and acceleration, ice coverage, clean and controlled curves, multi-directional skating, and mastery of one-foot skating (no overuse of skating on two feet). 
# Transitions (TR)
# Performance/Execution (PE)
# Choreography (CH)
# Interpretation (IN)
A detailed description of each component is given in ISU rule 322.2. Judges award each component a raw mark from 0 to 10 in increments of 0.25, with a mark of 5 being defined as "average". For each separate component, the raw marks are then selected, trimmed, and averaged in a manner akin to determining a ''grade of execution''. The trimmed mean scores are then translated into a factored mark by multiplying by a factor that depends on the discipline, competition segment, and level. Then the five (or four) factored marks are added to give the final PCS score.

The ''total element score'' and the ''program components score'' are added to give the total score for a competition segment (TSS). A skater's final placement is determined by the total of their scores in all segments of a competition. No ordinal rankings are used to determine the final results.

===Other judging and competition===
There are also skating competitions organized for professional skaters by independent promoters. These competitions use judging rules set by whoever organizes the competition. There is no "professional league". Well-known professional competitions in the past have included the [[World Professional Figure Skating Championships|World Professional Championships]] (held in Landover, Maryland), the Challenge Of Champions, the Canadian Professional Championships and the [[World Professional Figure Skating Championships|World Professional Championships]] (held in Jaca, Spain).

The [[Ice Skating Institute]] (ISI), an international ice rink trade organization, runs its own competitive and test program aimed at recreational skaters. Originally headquartered in Minnesota, the organization now operates out of Dallas, Texas. ISI competitions are open to any member that have registered their tests. There are very few "qualifying" competitions, although some districts hold Gold Competitions for that season's first-place winners. ISI competitions are especially popular in Asian countries that do not have established ISU member federations. The [[Gay Games]] have also included skating competitions for same-gender pairs and dance couples under ISI sponsorship. Other figure skating competitions for adults also attract participants from diverse cultures.

== World standings and season's bests ==

=== World standings ===
{{main|ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking}}
The '''world standing (WS)''' of a skater/couple is calculated based on the results over the current and preceding two seasons. Competitors receive points based on their final placement at an event and the event's weight. The following events receive points:&lt;ref name=isuws/&gt;
* ISU Championships (World, European, Four Continents, and World Junior Championships) and Olympic Winter Games: The best result by points per season, the best two results by points over the three seasons.
* ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating and Final (senior and junior): The two best results by points per season, the best four results by points over the three seasons.
* International senior calendar competitions: The two best results by points per season, the best four results by points over the three seasons.
 	
Following the current season's World Championships, the results from the earliest season are deleted. A new partnership starts with zero points; there is no transfer of WS points if a pair or ice dance couple split up and form a new partnership.

These standings do not necessarily reflect the capabilities of the skater(s). Due to limits on entries to events (no more than three from each country), and varying numbers of high-level skaters in each country, skaters from some countries may find it more difficult to qualify to compete at major events. Thus, a skater with a lower SB but from a country with few high-level skaters may qualify to a major event while a skater with a much higher SB but from a country with more than three high-level skaters may not be sent. As a result, it is possible for a skater who regularly scores higher to end up with a much lower world standing.

The ''season's world ranking'' of a skater/couple is calculated similarly to the overall world standing but is based on the results of the ongoing season only.&lt;ref name =isuws/&gt;

=== Season's bests ===
The '''season's best (SB)''' of a skater/couple is the highest score achieved within a particular season. There is an SB for the combined total score and the individual segment scores (short program/rhythm dance, free skating/free dance). Only scores achieved at selected international competitions are considered; scores from national competitions and some international events are disregarded. The best combined total for each skater or couple appears on a list of season's bests,&lt;ref name=isustats&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isu.org/statistics|title=Statistics Personal &amp; Season's Best|publisher=[[International Skating Union|ISU]]|access-date=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the list may be used to help determine participants in the following season's Grand Prix series. 

Skaters and couples also have '''personal best (PB)''' scores, i.e. the highest scores achieved over their entire career, in terms of combined total and segment scores. However, PB scores are not completely comparable if achieved in different seasons because the ISU regulations and technical rules are modified prior to each new season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isu.org/isu-statutes-constitution-regulations-technical|title=ISU Statutes, Constitution, Regulations &amp; Technical Rules (2018)|publisher=[[International Skating Union|ISU]]|access-date=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be different requirements specified to achieve a certain level; the required elements may change and new elements may be allowed (for example, two quads in the short program were permitted starting in the [[2010–11 figure skating season|2010–11 season]]); and the point values may change (for example, the values of quads were increased after the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Olympics]], and a second step sequence is no longer assigned a level in the men's competition). As a result of these variations in the technical requirements, the ISU places more weight on the season's bests, which are fully comparable within any one season.

== Music and clothing ==
[[File:2012 WFSC 04d 575 Tessa Virtue Scott Moir.JPG|thumb|right|An example of ice dance costumes]]

=== Music ===
For competitive programs, figure skaters were once restricted to instrumental music; vocals were allowed only if they contained no lyrics or words.&lt;ref name=vocalsnote/&gt; Beginning in the 1997–98 season, the [[International Skating Union|ISU]] decided to allow lyrics or words in [[ice dance]] music. Although the rules were not relaxed for singles and pairs, judges did not always penalize violations. At the [[2011 World Figure Skating Championships|2011 World Championships]], [[Florent Amodio]]'s long program music included words but an insufficient number of judges voted for a deduction.&lt;ref name=w11mlp/&gt; In June 2012, the ISU voted to allow skaters from all disciplines to choose music with words in their competitive programs beginning in the [[2014–15 figure skating season|2014–15 season]].&lt;ref name=NYT140218/&gt;&lt;ref name=IN140716/&gt;

Skaters may use professional music editors so that their music meets requirements.&lt;ref name=NDN140217/&gt; Ice dancers are required to skate to music that has a definite beat or rhythm. Singles and pair skaters more often skate to the melody and phrasing of their music. For [[free skating|long program]]s, figure skaters generally search for music with different moods and tempos.&lt;ref name=IN120423/&gt; Music selections for exhibitions are less constrained than for competitive programs.

=== Clothing ===
Skaters are generally free to select their own attire, with a few restrictions. In competition, females may wear a dress, typically with matching attached briefs, and since 2004, they may also choose trousers.&lt;ref name=ST041205/&gt; They may wear opaque flesh-colored leggings or tights under dresses and skirts, which may extend to cover their skates. Men must wear trousers – they are not allowed to wear tights, although, officials do not always impose a deduction for violations.&lt;ref name=GS121031/&gt; Matching costumes are not required in pair skating and ice dance.&lt;ref name=AS120818/&gt;

Competition costumes vary widely, from simple designs to heavily beaded or trimmed costumes. Skaters risk a deduction if a piece of their costume falls onto the ice surface. An official may stop a program if he or she deems there to be a hazard. Skaters and family members may design their own costumes, sometimes with assistance from their coach or choreographer, or turn to professional designers.&lt;ref name=AS120818/&gt;&lt;ref name=IN120820cos/&gt;&lt;ref name=AS120914/&gt;&lt;ref name=AS121004/&gt; Costumes may cost thousands of dollars if designed by a top-level costumemaker.

According to current ISU regulations, costumes in competition "must be modest, dignified and appropriate for athletic competition – not garish or theatrical in design. Clothing may, however, reflect the character of the music chosen."&lt;ref name=isuSFTR/&gt; Although the use of flesh-colored fabric means the costumes are often less revealing than they may appear, there have been repeated attempts to ban clothing that gives the impression of "excessive nudity" or that is otherwise inappropriate for athletic competition.&lt;ref name=usfsa99rb/&gt; In general, accessories or props are not permitted in competition.&lt;ref name=isuSFTR/&gt; The ISU allowed an exception for the [[original dance]] in the 2007–08 season but not since.

== Eligibility ==

=== Age eligibility ===
To compete internationally on the senior level, skaters must be at least 15 before July 1 of the preceding year. To be eligible for junior-level events, a skater must be at least 13 but under 19 before that date (or 21 for male pair skaters and ice dancers).&lt;ref name=espn/&gt;&lt;ref name=isuage/&gt; A skater must meet the age requirement ''before'' it becomes July 1 in their place of birth. For example, [[Adelina Sotnikova]] was born a few hours into July 1, 1996 in [[Moscow]] and consequently, was not eligible to compete at Junior Worlds until 2011 and senior Worlds until 2013.&lt;ref name=se1210/&gt; The ISU's rules apply to international events. Many countries have no age requirements for domestic non-ISU competitions, thus, some skaters compete at the senior level nationally while not eligible for international competition.

The [[International Skating Union|ISU]] has modified its age rules several times. Prior to the 1990s, 12 was the minimum age for senior international competitions.&lt;ref name=cbs980615/&gt; New rules were introduced in 1996, requiring skaters to be at least 15 before July 1 of the preceding year in order to compete at the Olympics, Worlds, Europeans, or Four Continents.&lt;ref name=espn/&gt; The minimum age for all other senior internationals was 14 until July 2014, when it was raised to 15.

During the 2005–06 season, [[Mao Asada]] of Japan was age-eligible to compete at the Grand Prix Final, where she claimed the title, but she was not permitted to compete at the Olympics. For the [[2008 World Figure Skating Championships|2008 World Championships]], the United States was obliged to send skaters who had placed 5th and 7th at nationals because higher-placed skaters were too young, including a skater who missed the cutoff by 20 days.&lt;ref name=espn/&gt;&lt;ref name=agereq/&gt; The ISU has strictly enforced the rules in recent years.&lt;ref name=espn/&gt; However, American pair skater [[Natasha Kuchiki]] was allowed to compete at the [[1990 World Figure Skating Championships|1990 World Championships]] when she was two years too young and American single skater [[Tara Lipinski]], who was 13 at the time the 1996 rules were introduced, was [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] into remaining eligible for future events, along with other skaters who had already competed at the World Championships. A loophole also existed for a few years for underage skaters who had medaled at Junior Worlds.&lt;ref name=cbs000316/&gt;

As in [[Age requirements in gymnastics#Age falsification|gymnastics]], skating has experienced controversy surrounding possible [[Age fabrication|age falsification]]. On February 14, 2011, questions emerged surrounding nine Chinese skaters. The [[Associated Press]] found that birthdates listed on the [[Chinese Skating Association]]'s website suggested five female skaters, [[Sui Wenjing]], [[Zhang Dan]], [[Yu Xiaoyu]], [[Geng Bingwa]], and [[Xu Binshu]], were younger than their ISU ages, and four male skaters, [[Han Cong]], [[Zhang Hao (figure skater)|Zhang Hao]], [[Jin Yang]], and [[Gao Yu (figure skater)|Gao Yu]], were older.&lt;ref name=espn/&gt; The dates disappeared from the website by February 15.&lt;ref name=feb1711/&gt; On February 17, the ISU said there were no discrepancies for [[Zhang Dan]], [[Zhang Hao (figure skater)|Zhang Hao]], and [[Xu Binshu]] between the birthdates listed on their passports, ISU registration forms and the [[Chinese Olympic Committee]]'s website.&lt;ref name=feb1711/&gt; Athletes in China sometimes face pressure to falsify their age.&lt;ref name=survive/&gt;

=== Other eligibility rules ===
Skaters may represent a country of which they are not yet a citizen in most competitions, except the Olympics which require citizenship.

At most international events, each country may send one to a maximum of three entries per discipline. Consequently, even if a skater has a high season's best, he or she may not be sent to major events if their country has many good skaters in their discipline. Some skaters have tried to circumvent this by switching to another country. In response, the ISU introduced rules barring skaters from international events for a certain period of time. In the 2010 regulations, it was 24 months or more from the date of the last ISU Championship.&lt;ref name=genreg2010/&gt; In the 2012 regulations, the minimum was 18 months for singles and 12 months for pairs/ice dancers from the date of their last ISU Championships (Worlds, Europeans, Four Continents, Junior Worlds) and 12 months if they competed in some other international competition.&lt;ref name=genreg2012/&gt; Competitors may sit out for much longer because they also have to obtain a release from their previous federation. The ISU has set no limit to how long a country may hold skaters.&lt;ref name=genreg2012/&gt;

Skaters may lose their ISU eligibility if they perform in an unsanctioned show or competition.

Beginning in the [[2010–11 figure skating season|2010–11 season]], minimum scores were introduced for the World, European, or Four Continents Championships. In the [[2011–12 figure skating season|2011–12]] season, different minimum scores were introduced for the Grand Prix series.

== Competitors' expenses, income, and funding ==
Figure skating is an expensive sport.&lt;ref name=usfscost/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt32611/&gt;&lt;ref name=EJ130311/&gt;&lt;ref name=tie110920/&gt; This is particularly due to the costs of ice time and coaching.&lt;ref name=nyt991219/&gt; In the late 1980s, the expenses of a top-ten ladies' competitor at the U.S. Championships reached nearly [[United States dollar|US$]]50,000 a year.&lt;ref name=SS880228/&gt; In October 2004, a [[U.S. Figure Skating]] article estimated the annual expense at US$9,000–$10,000 for pre-juvenile, US$18,000 for juvenile, US$35,000–$40,000 for novice, and said junior and senior levels were somewhat more expensive.&lt;ref name=usfscost/&gt; In the 2010s, American senior national medalists had expenses in the mid-five-figure range.&lt;ref name=nyt32611/&gt;&lt;ref name=SI130410/&gt; Swiss skater [[Stéphane Lambiel]] said his costs were around [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 100,000 per season.&lt;ref name=AS120402/&gt; World champion [[Patrick Chan]]'s expenses were [[Canadian dollar|Can$]]150,000.&lt;ref name=embracing/&gt; In 2015, [[CBC Sports]] estimated that a Canadian pair team had expenses of about Can$100,000 per year.&lt;ref name=CBC151118b/&gt;

Prize money is relatively low compared to other sports.&lt;ref name=ct111028/&gt; A men's or ladies' singles skater who won the [[2011 World Figure Skating Championships|2011 World Championships]] earned US$45,000,&lt;ref name=isuprev110423/&gt; about 1.8% to 2.5% of the US$1,800,000–$2,400,000 for winners of the tennis [[2011 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and [[2012 Australian Open|Australian Open]].&lt;ref name=usopen/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap120123/&gt; A couple who won the pairs or ice dance title split US$67,500.&lt;ref name=isuprev110423/&gt; A winner of the senior [[2011–12 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]] in December 2011 earned US$25,000.&lt;ref name=isu111207/&gt;

Some national associations provide funding to some skaters if they meet certain criteria.&lt;ref name=usfsfunding/&gt; Many skaters take part-time jobs and some have tried [[crowdfunding]].&lt;ref name=IN120531/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBC151118/&gt; In Germany, many elite skaters join the army to fund their skating.&lt;ref name=ifs110713/&gt; In Italy, some skaters join police agencies' sport groups, such as the [[Polizia Penitenziaria]]'s ''[[Gruppo Sportivo Fiamme Azzurre|Fiamme Azzurre]]'' ([[Carolina Kostner]], [[Anna Cappellini]], [[Luca Lanotte]])&lt;ref name=peniten/&gt;&lt;ref name=peniten2/&gt; or [[Polizia di Stato]]'s ''Fiamme Oro'' ([[Federica Faiella]], [[Paolo Bacchini]]).&lt;ref name=polstato/&gt; Some competitive skaters depend on income from shows.&lt;ref name=dilemma/&gt;&lt;ref name=promin/&gt; Shows must be sanctioned by their association, i.e. skaters may lose their competitive eligibility if they take part without permission. In some cases, skaters may feel pressure to compete through injury in order to be allowed to perform in a show.&lt;ref name=dilemma/&gt;

== Injuries and health issues ==
Competitive skaters generally do not wear helmets or other protective gear. There is a risk of head injuries, particularly in [[pair skating]] as a result of falls from lifts.&lt;ref name=cbs991017/&gt;&lt;ref name=binnebose/&gt; Although pair skaters are most susceptible, serious head injuries can occur in all disciplines, including ice dance.&lt;ref name=IN160202/&gt;&lt;ref name=IN120713dl/&gt;&lt;ref name=abssk2010/&gt; Partners have accidentally slashed each other with their skate blades.&lt;ref name=batessamuelson/&gt;&lt;ref name=icenetfeb12/&gt; This may occur when partners drift too close during side-by-side [[camel spins]]. Several female pair skaters have suffered head/face injuries during this element, including [[Elena Berezhnaya]],&lt;ref name=comeback/&gt; [[Jessica Dubé]],&lt;ref name=cnn070423/&gt; [[Mandy Wötzel]],&lt;ref name=nytjl980204/&gt; [[Galina Efremenko|Galina Maniachenko (Efremenko)]],&lt;ref name=maniachenko/&gt; and [[Elena Riabchuk]].&lt;ref name=rzinj/&gt;

Commenting on falls and concussions, [[Madison Hubbell]] said that "Most of the time, the worst falls are on things we kind of take for granted."&lt;ref name=IN160202/&gt; [[Shin splints]],&lt;ref name=SM1404/&gt; knee injuries, and back problems are not uncommon.&lt;ref name=NYT090622/&gt;&lt;ref name=gs4202/&gt;&lt;ref name=podtod/&gt; Hip damage may occur as a result of practising jumps and throws.&lt;ref name=NYT090622/&gt;&lt;ref name=taralip/&gt; In rare cases, intensive training of spins may result in subtle concussions ([[Lucinda Ruh]]).&lt;ref name=spincon/&gt;&lt;ref name=NBCC140212/&gt;

Injuries have also been sustained by skaters from different teams when there are many skaters practising on the ice.&lt;ref name=densta/&gt; [[Midori Ito]] collided with [[Laetitia Hubert]] at the 1991 World Championships, while [[Oksana Baiul]] and [[Tanja Szewczenko]] collided at the 1994 Olympics, but all went on to compete. On practice sessions with multiple skaters on the ice, the skater whose music is playing conventionally has right of way. In addition, pairs and ice dancers skating as a unit have right of way over those skating separately as changing course is more difficult for a couple.

In some countries, medical personnel may be slow to respond to accidents. At the [[2000 World Figure Skating Championships|2000 World Championships]] in [[Nice]], France, a pair skater who had been injured in a lift accident lay on the ice for several minutes and had to get up and leave the ice on his own before being offered medical attention.&lt;ref name=AP000329op/&gt;

[[Eating disorders]] are reportedly common in figure skating.&lt;ref name=HP100120/&gt;&lt;ref name=HP100121/&gt;&lt;ref name=muscles/&gt;

Figure skaters occasionally have positive doping results but it is not common.&lt;ref name=WADA/&gt; Commenting on Soviet skaters, three-time Olympic champion [[Irina Rodnina]] stated in 1991, "Boys in pairs and singles used drugs, but this was only in August or September. This was done just in training, and everyone was tested (in the Soviet Union) before competitions."&lt;ref name=CT910214/&gt;

== History ==
{{Main article|History of figure skating}}
[[File:Jackson Haines2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jackson Haines]], considered to be the father of modern figure skating.]]
Although people have been [[ice skating]] for centuries, figure skating in its current form originated in the mid-19th century. ''A Treatise on Skating'' (1772) by Englishman Robert Jones, is the first known account of figure skating. Competitions were then held in the "English style" of skating, which was stiff and formal and bore very little resemblance to modern figure skating. Before the changes in figure skating techniques, there were a limited number of moves that could be performed. This was true in the mid-1800s but was later changed by American skater [[Jackson Haines]], who was considered to be the "father of modern figure skating". He introduced a new style of skating in the mid-1860s, incorporating free and expressive techniques, which became known as the "international style." Although popular in Europe, Haines' international style of skating was not widely adopted in the United States until long after his death.&lt;ref name=Haines/&gt;

=== Early 1900s ===
[[File:Special figures by Panin.svg|thumb|left|[[Special figures]] by [[Nikolai Panin]] at the [[Figure skating at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics]] ]]

The [[International Skating Union|ISU]] was founded in 1892. The first [[European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]] were held in 1891, and the first [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]] were held in 1896 and won by [[Gilbert Fuchs]]. Only men competed in these events. In 1902, a woman, [[Madge Syers]], entered the World competition for the first time, finishing second. The ISU quickly banned women from competing against men, but established a separate competition for "ladies" in 1906. [[Pair skating]] was introduced at the 1908 World Championships, where the title was won by [[Anna Hübler]] and [[Heinrich Burger]]. Figure skating was the first winter sport introduced to the Olympics; its Olympic debut came at the [[Figure skating at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=AFS2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=ISUHistory/&gt;

On March 20, 1914 an international figure skating championship was held in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. This was the ancestor of both the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|United States]] and [[Canadian Figure Skating Championships|Canadian National Championships]]. However, international competitions in figure skating were interrupted by [[World War I]].

In the 1920s and 1930s, figure skating was dominated by [[Sonja Henie]], who turned competitive success into a lucrative professional career as a movie star and touring skater. Henie also set the fashion for female skaters to wear short skirts and white boots.&lt;ref name=spillhenie/&gt; The top male skaters of this period included [[Gillis Grafström]] and [[Karl Schäfer]].

=== After World War II ===
Skating competitions were again interrupted for several years by [[World War II]]. After the war, with many European rinks in ruins, skaters from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] began to dominate international competitions and to introduce technical innovations to the sport. [[Dick Button]], 1948 and 1952 Olympic Champion, was the first skater to perform the double axel and triple loop jumps, as well as the flying camel spin.

The World Figure Skating Championships did not include [[ice dance]] until [[1952 World Figure Skating Championships|1952]].&lt;ref name=ISUHistory/&gt; In its early years, ice dance was dominated by British skaters, and until 1960 the world title was won every year by a British couple, beginning with [[Jean Westwood (figure skater)|Jean Westwood]] and [[Lawrence Demmy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Figure Skating|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=LSEkqy6BS44C&amp;q=jean+westwood#v=snippet&amp;q=jean%20westwood&amp;f=false|first=James R.|last=Hines|page=102|publisher=Scarecrow Press|date=April 22, 2011|isbn=9780810870857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 1961, the entire U.S. figure skating team and their coaches were killed in the crash of [[Sabena Flight 548]] in [[Brussels|Brussels, Belgium]] en route to the World Championships in [[Prague]]. This tragedy sent the U.S. skating program into a period of rebuilding.

Meanwhile, the [[Soviet Union]] rose to become a dominant force in the sport, especially in the disciplines of pair skating and ice dance. At every Winter Olympics from 1964 until 2006, a Soviet or Russian pair won gold in pair skating, in what is often considered to be one of the longest winning streaks in modern sports history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/35400871/ns/sports-olympic_sports/ |title=Shen-Zhao set record in pairs short program|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304020251/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/35400871/ns/sports-olympic_sports/|date=February 14, 2010|archive-date=March 4, 2010|dead-url=yes|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/olympics/index.ssf/2010/02/shen_zhao_capture_pairs_skatin.html|title=Shen, Zhao capture pairs skating gold as China takes silver, too; Russians shut out from podium|date=February 16, 2010|author=[[Associated Press]]|website=[[cleveland.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news-features/news/newsid=444839.html|title=Russian skating slump hits home hard|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226040725/https://www.nbcolympics.com/news-features/news/newsid=444839.html|date=February 24, 2010|archive-date=February 26, 2010|dead-url=yes|publisher=[[NBC Olympic broadcasts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1967 World Figure Skating Championships|1967 World Championships]] was the last event held on an outdoor rink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iceskatingintnl.com/archive/results_euros/2011%20Euro%20Preview.htm |title=2011 European Championships Preview |first=Alexandra |last=Stevenson |year=2011 |work=IceSkatingIntnl.com |accessdate=March 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921114844/http://www.iceskatingintnl.com/archive/results_euros/2011%20Euro%20Preview.htm |archivedate=September 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect of television and the present day ===
[[Compulsory figures]] formerly accounted for up to 60% of the score in singles figure skating,&lt;ref name=CBS981216/&gt; which meant that skaters who could build up a big lead in figures could win competitions even if they were mediocre free skaters. As [[television]] coverage of skating events became more important, so did free skating. Beginning in 1968, the ISU began to progressively reduce the weight of figures and introduced the short program in 1973.&lt;ref name=CBS981216/&gt; With these changes, the emphasis in competitive figure skating shifted to increasing athleticism. By the 1980s, some skaters began practising [[Quad (figure skating)|quadruple jumps]]. [[Jozef Sabovcik]] of Czechoslovakia landed a quad [[Toe loop jump|toe loop]] at the [[1986 European Figure Skating Championships|1986 European Championships]] which was recognized at the event but then ruled invalid three weeks later due to a touchdown with his free foot.&lt;ref name=quadevo991202/&gt; At the [[1988 World Figure Skating Championships|1988 World Championships]], [[Kurt Browning]] of Canada landed the first quad toe loop which has remained ratified.&lt;ref name=nyt880326/&gt; Although it was expected that quads would soon become an important part of men's skating, it was a number of years before this happened.&lt;ref name=quadevo991202/&gt; Japan's [[Midori Ito]] landed the first triple axel by a woman. Worth only 20% by 1989, figures were eliminated entirely from international competition in 1990.&lt;ref name=CBS981216/&gt;

Television showing skaters in the [[kiss and cry]] area after competing contributed to the sport's popularity.&lt;ref name=macur20100222/&gt; Television also played a role in removing the restrictive [[amateurism|amateur]] status rules that once governed the sport. In May 1990, the ISU voted to allow skaters who were intending to skate professionally to return to ISU competition if they obtained their national association's permission.&lt;ref name=nyt900502/&gt; To retain skaters who might otherwise have given up their eligibility to participate in lucrative professional events, in 1995 the ISU introduced prize money at its major competitions, funded by revenues from selling the TV rights to those events.

In 1984, more than 24 million people in Great Britain watched ice dance pair [[Jayne Torvill]] and [[Christopher Dean]] earn unanimous 6.0s for presentation, the only perfect score in Olympic skating history, which was ranked the 8th greatest sporting moment in a UK poll.&lt;ref name=BBC840214/&gt;&lt;ref name=CH4GSM/&gt; In the 1993 National Sports Study II, considered by the [[Associated Press]] as the largest study of spectator sport popularity in America, ladies' figure skating was the second most popular spectator sport in America, just behind [[National Football League|NFL football]] out of over 100 sports surveyed.&lt;ref name=1993nssII/&gt; The 1993 study found that three figure skaters – [[Dorothy Hamill]], [[Peggy Fleming]], and [[Scott Hamilton (figure skater)|Scott Hamilton]]&lt;ref name=lvsun/&gt; – were among the eight most popular athletes in the United States, out of over 800 athletes surveyed.&lt;ref name=iebrennan/&gt; [[Dorothy Hamill]] was statistically tied with [[Mary Lou Retton]] as the most popular athlete in America. The [[Tonya Harding]] scandal in 1994 increased interest in figure skating.&lt;ref name=nyt940206/&gt; The first night of the ladies' figure skating competition in the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] achieved higher TV [[Nielsen ratings]] than that year's Super Bowl and was the most watched sports television program of all time, to that date.&lt;ref name=usatslip/&gt;

Spectators sometimes throw a variety of items, most commonly stuffed toys and flowers, onto the ice in support of their favorite skaters but officials discourage flowers which are not fully wrapped due to the possibility of debris disrupting or endangering the following skaters.&lt;ref name=TGAM130119/&gt;&lt;ref name=LFP130308/&gt;

Countries who have produced many successful skaters in recent decades include Russia and the former Soviet Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, China, France, Germany, and Italy. While the sport has grown in East Asia, training opportunities in South Asia are limited due to a scarcity of ice rinks. [[India]] had only four major indoor ice rinks as of 2011, but there were plans for ten more to be built, mostly in malls, over the following five years.&lt;ref name=india/&gt;

[[Four skating]] has mostly disappeared while [[synchronized skating]], singles/pair skating and ice dance have grown. On April 6, 2011, the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] officially confirmed the approval of a team event, which was introduced at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=reu110406/&gt; The elimination of the [[compulsory dance (ice dance)|compulsory dance]] provided space for the team event.&lt;ref name=reu120329/&gt; Each team is composed of a men's and ladies' singles skater, a pair, and an ice dance duo. Ten teams may compete, with five eliminated after the short program.&lt;ref name=ctteam/&gt; In December 2011, the ISU released details of the qualifying system and the competition.&lt;ref name=isu9861/&gt;

[[File:Jayne_Torvill_and_Christopher_Dean_-_Dancing_on_Ice_2011.jpg|thumb|right| [[Torvill and Dean]] on ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'']]
In 1937, [[Sonja Henie]] appeared in the film ''[[Thin Ice (1937 film)|Thin Ice]]''. Figure skating has been the focus of several later Hollywood films, including ''[[The Cutting Edge]]'' (and its sequels, ''[[The Cutting Edge: Going for the Gold]]'', ''[[The Cutting Edge: Chasing the Dream]]'' and ''[[The Cutting Edge: Fire and Ice]]''), ''[[Ice Princess]]'', ''[[Ice Castles]]'', ''[[Ice Angel]]'', ''[[Go Figure (film)|Go Figure]]'', ''[[Blades of Glory]]'', and ''[[I, Tonya]]''. Olympic champion [[Brian Boitano]] was parodied in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'' in the song "[[What Would Brian Boitano Do?]]". 

In 2006, ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'' began broadcasting in the UK. The show involves celebrities and their professional partners figure skating in front of a panel of judges. The judges have included British Olympic gold medalists [[Torvill and Dean]] and double Olympic champion [[Katarina Witt]]. The show has since been [[Dancing on Ice around the world|exported to eight other countries]] around the world. U.S. national champion [[Johnny Weir]] was the focus of the reality show ''Be Good Johnny Weir'' which aired on the [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]]. Figure skating plays a prominent role in ''[[Yuri on Ice]]'', an anime that aired in autumn 2016 which focuses on the career of fictional figure skater Katsuki Yuri.

'''Forthill''' is a [[cricket]] ground in [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]].  The first recorded match held on the ground came in 1911 when Fofarshire Cricket Club played [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] during the English counties tour of Scotland.&lt;ref name="OTH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/24/1680_misc.html|title=Other matches played on Forthill, Dundee|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Scotland cricket team|Scotland]] first used the ground in 1913 when they played [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]].&lt;ref name="OTH"/&gt;  The ground held its inaugural [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match in 1924 when Scotland played [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]].  The touring [[India national cricket team|Indians]] played Scotland in a first-class match there in 1932.  Almost twenty years elapsed before first-class cricket returned to Forthill, with Scotland playing [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] in 1951.  The ground later played host to the touring [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealanders]] in 1978 and Ireland in 1992, before hosting its final first-class match when Scotland played the [[South Africa Academy cricket team|South Africa Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/24/1680_f.html|title=First-Class Matches played on Forthill, Dundee|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the twentieth century the ground hosted several touring teams, though the matches were not rated as first-class.&lt;ref name="OTH"/&gt;

The ground is still in use today by Forfarshire Cricket Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forfarshire.co.uk/|title=Forfarshire Cricket Club|publisher=www.forfarshire.co.uk|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[handball]] goalkeeper is the most defensive player of his team. His main task is to prevent the other team from scoring a goal.
[[File:7m Penalty Handball.jpg|thumb|[[Thierry Omeyer]] during a seven-metre throw]]

==Equipment==
To avoid confusion, a handball goalkeeper has to wear a jersey that is different in colour to all the other jerseys of the players on the field, including the other team's goalkeeper. If such a jersey is not available the goalkeeper has to wear a [[:de:Leibchen|bib]] that guarantees sufficient distinction between players involved. Most goalkeepers also wear special long trousers and male goalkeepers always wear a [[jockstrap]] (a undergarment serving protection purposes). Rule 4:9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/en-us/thegame/statutesandregulations.aspx|title=Statutes and Regulations|last=Portal|first=IHF|website=www.ihf.info|accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (concerning equipment during the game) states that it is mandatory for the players to wear sports shoes during the games. Unlike in football, handball goalkeepers do not equip with gloves although this is not prohibited by the rules.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Gloves are in fact rejected because they are regarded as a sign of weakness amongst fellow goalkeepers and also worsen the throwing ability of the goalkeeper.{{By whom|section=Discussion about whom|date=March 2018}} Additional [[Protective gear in sports|protective gear]] like face masks and helmets had been discused in the early days of the game, but are nowadays prohibited, as are any items that could endanger the opposing players including piercings, necklaces, earrings and glasses.
[[File:Goalkeeper handball penalty shot.jpg|thumb|A woman goalkeeper during a seven-metre throw]]

==Rules for the goalkeeper==
All rules can be found on the IHF website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/files/Uploads/NewsAttachments/0_New-Rules%20of%20the%20Game_GB.pdf |format=PDF |title=IX. Rules of the Game |website=Ihf.info |accessdate=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team has to appoint one player on the field as the goalie. However, a goalie can transition to a field player at any time during a game. In order to do this he needs to be substituted and change his goalie jersey to a field player's jersey. A field player can assume the goalkeeper's position in the same manner. Rule 5&lt;ref name="regel5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handballregeln.de/show.php?datei=r5.inc|publisher=handballregeln.de|title=Regel 5 (www.handballregeln.de)|accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;The Goalkeeper&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; deals with all the rules pertaining to the goalie and a set of special rules about the goal area. Inside this area the goalkeeper is allowed to touch the ball with every part of his body in order to parry the ball. Additionally, several rules do not apply to the goalie inside the goal area. These rules are: the 3-second-rule (7:2), the 3-step-rule (7:3), the rule for bouncing the ball (7:4) and the multiple-touching-of-the-ball-rule (7:7). However, if the goalie purposefully delays playing the ball a referee can call passive gameplay.

The goalie is allowed to step out of the goal area and onto the playing field when not in possession of the ball at all times. While outside the goal area all rules pertaining to field players apply to him as well. Furthermore, he is allowed to step out of the goal area with the ball while he is still trying to get it under control (5:4). The goalkeeper is not allowed to leave the goal area with the ball under control if the referee has whistled for the execution of a goalkeeper-throw (5:6). This throw has to be executed within the goal area. Rule 5:7+8 stipulate that while standing inside the goal area the goalkeeper is not allowed to touch a rolling or stationary ball outside the goal area. Moreover, he is not allowed to re-enter the goal area from the playing field with the ball (5:9). The goalie must not touch the ball with his foot or the leg below the knee if the ball is moving out towards the playing area (5:10). During a 7-metre throw from the opposing team the goalkeeper is not allowed to cross the goalkeeper's restraining line (4-metre-line) before the ball has left the hand of the opposing player executing the throw (5.11).

If the ball crosses the outer goal line outside the goalposts and the goalkeeper was the last player to touch the ball, the keeper gets the ball to execute a goalkeeper-throw inside the goal area. However, if the ball crosses the sideline the opposing team gets the ball for a throw-in.
[[File:Johannes Bitter 04.jpg|thumb|[[Johannes Bitter]]]]
Sometimes the goalkeeper will be used as a seventh field player or substituted by a regular field player. This normally happens during the last minutes of play if the score is a tie or the attacking  team is down by just a few points. The extra player is added to increase the team's chances for a win or a tie.

== Duties and requirements of a handball goalkeeper ==
The goalkeeper's primary task is to prevent the other team from scoring a goal, which is achieved when the ball fully passes the goal line. The game has become much more fast-paced over the years which demands that the goalkeeper has to bring the ball back into play very fast, leading to [[fast break]]s or turnovers which provide very good scoring chances. Strategies like the second wave or the so-called ''schnelle Mitte,'' are fast-action plays intended to  catch the opposing team off guard. After having conceded a goal the keeper passes the ball immediately to the centre of the court for a throw-off. In some situation the goalkeeper even scores a goal himself by taking advantage of the fact that the other team's goalie is too far away from his own goal and throwing the ball across the whole field into the empty goal. The German goalkeeper Johannes Bitter managed to score two goals in that manner over the course of his 112 international games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100330181714/http://www.dhb.de/index.php?id=bitter ''Johannes Bitter.''] ([[Web archiving|Memento]] vom 30. März 2010 im ''Internet Archive'') abgerufen am 27. November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Height is an important criterion for goalkeepers who want to play on a professional level. The rule of thumb in this regard is "the bigger the better". Dieter Bartke, a former goalkeeper of the German national league, was {{convert|2.16|m|abbr=on}} tall. Disadvantages in height are effectively compensated by other factors, like jumping power and flexibility of the body. Prominent examples are Wieland Schmidt ({{convert|1.85|m|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} tall) and Henning Fritz ({{convert|1.88|m|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}). Skills such as quick reflexes, quick comprehension and a distinct anticipation ability are considered more important than height. Modern handball training is focused on improving a goalkeeper's anticipation of typical in-game situations by implementing the so-called standard situation, a concept that simulates a set of the most common scenarios that can happen in a game. Sports scientists coined the phrase ''Aktionsmuster,'' action patterns, which goalkeepers try to embed in their subconsciousness.

==Common goalkeeper injuries==
Problems in the [[elbow]] area are most common among handball goalies. In 1992 a study conducted in Norway reported that 329 out of 729 (45%) handball goalkeepers suffered from pain in the elbow joint area. In contrast to these numbers only 166 out of 4120 (4%) field players complained about similar problems. In a follow-up survey out of these 729 goalkeepers 41% had acute problems and 34% reported past problems in the area. The health problem caused recurring pain and often the goalkeepers had to stop playing for several games due to injury. The apparent cause for these injuries is a repeated overextension of the elbow joint while trying to parry a ball. The authors of the study call the syndrome the ''handball goalie's elbow.''&lt;ref&gt;S. Tyrdal, R.

== Further remarks ==
[[File:Dejan Peric 04.jpg|thumb|[[Dejan Perić]]]]
If a goalkeeper receives a two-minute suspension he has to leave the field and is replaced by another goalkeeper, usually forcing his team to continue playing with one player less on the field. It has been under discussion for several years whether goalkeepers should be forbidden to step outside the goal area during fast breaks, a rule which has caused a lot of accidents between the goalie and field players.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bierschwale: [https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article490681/Unfall-schockt-Handball-Liga-Jakobsen-fordert-Konsequenzen.html ''Unfall schockt Handball-Liga: Jakobsen fordert Konsequenzen.''] In: ''Die Welt.'' 3. Dezember 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

If both teams have similar performance during a game, the goalkeeper's individual performance can have a huge impact on the outcome of the game. A ratio of 25 percent saves and more is regarded a very good performance with 50 percent saves very rarely being achieved over a time period of thirty minutes.

The [[jumping jack]] is a typical goalkeeper's defensive movement while trying to save the ball.

When a player's throw hits the goalkeeper's head, for example, from a seven-meter throw, the player will be disqualified (rule 8:5).&lt;ref name="regel8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handballregeln.de/show.php?datei=r8.inc|publisher=handballregeln.de|title=Regel 8 (www.handballregeln.de)|accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heredia''' is a Guatemalan [[association football|football]] team playing at the country's top level.

==History==
Founded as ''Deportivo Heredia'' in 1958, the club has been based in [[San José, El Petén|San Jose, Peten]] only since summer 2008. The team moved the club from [[Morales, Guatemala|Morales]] after low attendances and also changed the name to Heredia Jaguares de Peten after they only avoided relegation after appealing against [[Universad de San Carlos (Guatemalan football club)|Universidad]]'s use of two suspended players in the first leg of a relegation playoff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lared.com.gt/detalle_noticia.php?id=11327 Resolvieron a favor de Heredia] – La Red Deportiva {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2011, Club Deportivo Heredia announced its exodus back to [[Morales, Izabal]]. Saying that "Morales is the original and native place of the club."

In the spring of 2013 Heredia qualified for the [[CONCACAF Champions League]] for the first time in the club's history.  On 21 August 2013 they made history again by winning 1–0 the first match of the [[2013–14 CONCACAF Champions League|CCL]] Group stage against the Canadian club [[Montreal Impact]].  The match was played in neutral grounds at the [[Estadio Cementos Progreso|Cementos Progreso]] stadium in [[Guatemala City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Press Release |url=http://www.impactmontreal.com/en/news/2013/08/concacaf-report-impact-falls-1-0-cd-heredia-guatemala |title=CONCACAF – Report: Impact falls 1–0 to CD Heredia in Guatemala &amp;#124; Montreal Impact |publisher=Impactmontreal.com |date=22 August 2013 |accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main sponsor is Fuente Del Norte Bus line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concacaf.com/article/montreal-heredia-face-challenges-heading-into-ccl-meeting |title=Montreal, Heredia face challenges heading into CCL meeting |publisher=Concacaf.com |date= |accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadium==
The club plays its home games at [[Estadio Del Monte]] in [[Bananera]]. The stadium, however, does not meet the standards of [[CONCACAF]], therefore [[CONCACAF Champions League]] matches are played at the [[Estadio Cementos Progreso]] in [[Guatemala City]].

==History==
After a successful partnership on the Mud Hens Stadium ([[Fifth Third Field (Toledo)|Fifth Third Field]]), the Lucas County Commissioners teamed with HNTB Architecture Inc., a national sports architecture firm located in [[Kansas City, MO|Kansas City]]; The Collaborative Inc., of Toledo; and Poggemeyer Design Group, of Toledo, for a new arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lucas County Arena Project|url=http://www.lucascountyarena.com|publisher=Lucas County|accessdate=January 1, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125182233/http://www.lucascountyarena.com/|archivedate=January 25, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena was designed as the first new [[Leadership in Energy and Environment Design|LEED]] sports arena in the United States.  The arena's signature green design element is a {{convert|900|sqft|m2|adj=on}} "green wall" outside of the building, to feature the use of plant life on the exterior of the building to help cool the arena by shading the glass-enclosed main entrance of the arena.  The arena's location near mass transit systems, use of a light-colored roof membrane to reflect heat and sunlight, and underground cisterns collecting rain water to re-use for landscaping purposes around the arena, are also emphasized to earn LEED points for the project.&lt;ref name="Green arena"/&gt;

The Huntington Center opened in 2009

==Notable events==
The arena is part of a complex that includes [[SeaGate Convention Centre]] and [[Fifth Third Field (Toledo)|Fifth Third Field]]. The first person to perform at this venue was [[Jeff Dunham]].

Other performances that have happened at the Huntington Center include: [[Daughtry (band)|Daughtry]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[Rascal Flatts]], [[Carrie Underwood]], [[Elton John]], [[Brad Paisley]], [[Stevie Nicks]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Jason Aldean]], [[Hunter Hayes]], and [[Bob Seger]]. It is also the Toledo-area stop for [[World Wrestling Entertainment]].

[[File:LucasCountyArena.PNG|thumb|left|alt=logo for Lucas County Arena (former name)|The Huntington Center was formerly known as the Lucas County Arena]]
[[Huntington Bancshares|Huntington Bancshares Incorporated]] bought the naming rights to Lucas County Arena in April 2010 and renamed it as the Huntington Center.  The six-year, $2.1 million naming rights and sponsorship agreement includes three renewal options of six years each, and could mean total Huntington payments of $11 million.

The '''London New Zealand Cricket Club'''  is a [[cricket]] club in [[London]], [[England]], founded in December 1951 at [[High Commission of New Zealand, London|New Zealand's High Commission to the United Kingdom]] and plays teams in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Europe]].

Various players of the [[New Zealand national cricket team]] (and other international cricket teams), the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]], and [[first-class cricket|first-class]] players have appeared for the club over the years, although players of all abilities are welcome provided they are from [[New Zealand]] or have a deep connection thereto.

LNZCC raises its own teams and plays non-competition games at the grounds of the opposition. Many of the teams are competitive club teams or established friendly teams and many of the grounds are notable for their location and quality, for example, the early season fixture against [http://www.thewimbledonclub.co.uk/cricket Wimbledon] who play in the [[Surrey Championship]] and who play at the [[Wimbledon Cricket Club Ground]], located opposite the [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]]; the match vs the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] who play at the [[Artillery Ground]] in [[Finsbury]] in the [[City of London]]; against [[The Hurlingham Club]], an exclusive [[sports club|sports]] and [[social club|social]] club located in [[Fulham]], London, England. Other notable fixtures are played at Ripley in Surrey, vs [[Goodwood Cricket Club|Goodwood]] on The Duke of Richmond and Gordon's estate overlooking Goodwood House near Chichester and against Hagley CC at [[Hagley Hall]], the seat of the Lyttelton family and home of current Lord Chris and Lady Tessa Cobham.  The club has also played against touring New Zealand cricket team sides and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnzcc.org/notable-games.html|title=Notable games|work=London New Zealand Cricket Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and role ==
{{copypaste | url=http://www.lnzcc.org/history.html |date=September 2015}}&lt;!-- 81.144.146.180 21 February 2017 claimed that this was used with permission of LNZCC, but you need to send this form to Wikipedia to confirm such permission - [[Wikipedia:Declaration of consent for all enquiries]] --&gt;

The genesis of LNZCC was New Zealander Trevor Campbell shortly after [[World War II]], in his role as the ‘Public Relations Officer’ of the NZ High Commission.  Campbell posited that the UK was very grateful to New Zealand for its assistance of [[Great Britain]] in World War II and such signs of gratitude could be extended through cricket, a game widely popular in both countries, and that games could be played against teams who would no doubt feature returned servicemen who fought with New Zealanders during World War II.

Campbell was based at the New Zealand High Commission in the former ‘Dominion of New Zealand’ building,  [http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/34265/new-zealand-house-london-around-the-1920s 415] [[Strand, London|The Strand]], London and sought the help of [[Errol Holmes]] former [[England]] test cricketer, MCC captain to New Zealand in 1935/36 and then-current MCC committee member, in establishing a club. With the added support of NZ High Commissioner Sir [[Frederick Doidge]] and the MCC, Campbell invited more than 200 well-known [[New Zealanders]] living in the UK to meet.

LNZCC was formed at the New Zealand High Commission in December 1951 on one of the worst nights of the infamous London Pea Souper [[Great Smog|fogs]] - freezing smogs laden with toxic and deadly industrial pollutants which lasted for days on end. It was decided that the aim of LNZCC (which continues to this day, as well as meeting at the New Zealand High Commission building for a mid-season function) was to ''‘provide the opportunity for its members to play and enjoy cricket in the home of the game and to meet socially’''.

More than 70 people attended the meeting that formed LNZCC including many illustrious sporting and military names.  In attendance – Sir Arthur Simms; Sir Arthur Donnelly; Harold Gilligan (Captain of the England team that played New Zealand’s first ever test;) LEL Donne; Walter Hadlee; Roger Blunt; Alan Mitchell amongst others.  At the meeting, [[Roger Blunt]], a former New Zealand cricket team captain, was made the first Club Captain and Errol Holmes the first President, Campbell Honorary Secretary and invitations to stand as Vice-President were sent to then New Zealand Prime Minister Sir Sidney Holland and to High Commissioner Sir Frederick Doidge.  The first two men elected VP were Lord Newall (Cyril Newall, ex Governor-General of NZ and Marshall of the Royal Air Force during WW2) and Lord Freyberg VC (as General Bernard Freyberg, Commander of the NZ Expeditionary Force in WW2; earlier in his career he was awarded the Victoria Cross in the Battle of the Somme in 1916; later he was Governor- General of NZ.)

Amongst the active members of LNZCC were New Zealand test cricketers Tom Pritchard, Don Taylor, Roger Blunt, Bill Merritt and John Reid; Jim Laker, Ray Hitchcock (327 first-class games and 12,500 runs) and former All Black captain Ron Elvidge. 
       
A fixture list was soon created and the following year LNZCC was listed in the MCC's 'Register of Clubs' at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]].&lt;ref name="lnzcc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnzcc.org/inaugural-season.html|title=Inaugural season|work=London New Zealand Cricket Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Club Captain role has long since ceased but the President role continues with a change to 'Chairman' and together with a committee, LNZCC continues to attract cricket-playing New Zealanders and a small number of friends from the Commonwealth.

LNZCC celebrated its [[Golden Jubilee]] in 2002, when Paddy Gaffikin, an LNZCC newcomer in the 1966 season when New Zealanders arrived in the United Kingdom on ocean liners rather than long-haul aeroplanes, authored a history of the club entitled 'Kiwis on the Common'.&lt;ref name="Common 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaffikin |first1=Paddy |title=Kiwis on the Common |date=2002 |publisher=Tasman Publications |isbn=0954262107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Golden Jubilee season, and [[Diamond Jubilee]] season in 2012, were both celebrated at [[The Oval]], home ground of the [[Surrey cricket team]] (who LNZCC has also played&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;).

LNZCC continues to this day through the help of volunteers who provide a cricketing base and network for UK-based New Zealanders, be they young 'backpackers' on their 'OE', sportsmen playing in the UK, or established business people. Current and past membership of LNZCC is wide and illustrious.  LNZCC also has branches in [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]] and [[Christchurch]], New Zealand and games are played in LNZCC colours by members in New Zealand.

== Interesting facts ==
One of the most striking elements of LNZCC is the visually-appealing striped blazers worn by members to games and social events.  The blazers are made up of vertical stripes in the colours of the club - representing [[The City of London]] (red), the [[Silver Fern]] which is a sporting symbol of [[New Zealand]] (silver) and the blue symbolises the waters of the Pacific Ocean (Pacific blue).  Blazing bright in colour and mass, they are often captured by the media at test matches, Lord's Cricket Ground, The Oval and have been spotted at All Black test matches amongst others.  They've featured in news articles too.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10884619|title=Cricket: Expat club plays crucial role for all sorts of Kiwis|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.ripleycc.com Ripley] Cricket Club is the only fixture to have been played uninterrupted since the first season in 1952.

Since 2008 all LNZCC players are capped with ‘Nottman Caps’ once they have played five games. The Nottman Cap is named after Harold Nottman who was one of LNZCC's longest-serving playing members (from the 1950s to the 1990s no less) and a notable administrator in the club's history. One of his finest days on the cricket field for LNZCC was against [[Ripley Cricket Club]] when he took nine wickets in a match.

Overseas tours have included Porto in Portugal, matches vs teams in Denmark in the 1960s and a special match vs the Monte Carlo Cricket Club in Bouyon in the Alpes-Maritime near Nice.  Since 2013, LNZCC has toured the Mediterranean for matches in [[Ibiza]], [[Spain]] against the island's [http://ibizacricketclub.com cricket] team.

Naturally, members of the club are supporters of the New Zealand cricket team and have often made the news when traveling around the world for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11424792|title=Wish comes true for cricket crazy couple|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1509">An '''offensive coordinator''' is a member of the coaching staff of an [[American football]] or [[Canadian football]] team who is in charge of the team's [[offense (sports)|offense]].  Generally, along with the [[defensive coordinator]], he represents the second level of command structure after the [[head coach]].  The offensive coordinator is in charge of the team's offensive game plan, and typically calls offensive plays during the game, although some offensive-minded head coaches also handle play-calling.&lt;ref name=dummies&gt;"[http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/the-coaching-staff-in-american-football.html The Coaching Staff in American Football]," Dummies.com.  Retrieved October 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several position coaches work under the coordinator (position groupings can include [[quarterback]]s, [[wide receiver]]s, [[offensive line]], [[running back]]s, and [[tight end]]s).  The coordinator may also coach a position (typically quarterbacks).&lt;ref name=dummies /&gt;

Unlike most position coaches in football, who are usually on the sidelines during games, offensive coordinators have the option of operating from the [[press box]] instead of being on the sideline.  There are advantages and disadvantages to both locations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12553">The [[Philippine Basketball Association]]'s '''Best Player of the Conference Award''' is given to the best local (Filipino or part-Filipino) player at the end of each conference (tournament). It was first awarded in the 1994 All-Filipino Conference.

The '''[[Philippine Basketball Association Best Import of the Conference Award|Best Import Award]]''' is given to the best player (non-Filipino) at the end of each import-laden conference.

==Criteria==
The method of selecting the Best Player of the Conference is similar on how the [[Philippine Basketball Association Most Valuable Player award|season's Most Valuable Player]] is selected. The criteria used since the [[2011–12 PBA season]] are as follows:
*40% average statistical points
*30% press and media votes
*25% players' votes
*5% Commissioner's Office

Statistical points (SP) are computed as follows:
*1 SP for every point scored, rebound, assist, steal and blocked shot.
*10 bonus points for every game won where the player played up to the semifinals.
*15 bonus points for every game won where the player played in the Finals
*Deduction of 1 SP for every turnover, 5 SP for every technical or flagrant foul without ejection, and 15 SP for any technical or flagrant foul that results in an ejection.

In addition, a Filipino player can only be eligible for awards if he played in at least 70% of his team's games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111205010639/http://www.pba.ph/blogs/entry/167 DETERMINING THE BEST PLAYER OF THE CONFERENCE], PBA.ph&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rock Creek Park Golf Course''' (also known as '''Rock Creek Golf Course''') is a [[golf course]] located in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the [[United States]]. The entire course lies within [[Rock Creek Park]], a [[national park]] owned and maintained by the [[National Park Service]] division of the [[United States Department of the Interior]].

The course is located at the intersection of 16th Street NW and Rittenhouse Street NW. The course is bordered by Military Road NW in the south, [[Rock Creek (Potomac River)|Rock Creek]] and Beach Drive NW on the west, Sherrill Drive NW on the north, and 16th Street NW in the east.  [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] is immediately to the northwest.

Rock Creek Park Golf Course is one of three golf courses in Washington, D.C., all of which are owned by the National Park Service. The other two are [[East Potomac Park Golf Course]] and [[Langston Golf Course]].

==Course description==
Rock Creek Golf Course is known as a challenging course.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; The front nine holes are short par 4s and long par 3s, although the broad fairways have some elevation differences.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karlin"&gt;Karlin and St. Louis, ''Washington, D.C.,'' 2010, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The fairways of the back nine are tight, with dense deciduous woods on either side. Elevation changes on the back nine are even more significant, and many of the greens are quite small.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sehlinger, Surkiewicz, and Zibart, ''The Unofficial Guide to Washington, D.C.,'' 1994, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karlin" /&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the course one way in 1999:&lt;ref&gt;"Rock Creek's Back Nine: A Steep Challenge," ''Washington Post,'' June 20, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Want a unique, virtually free, profoundly humbling golf experience? Try the back nine at Rock Creek Golf Club. Rock Creek is one of two remaining public golf courses in the city, not as well known as East Potomac Park perhaps, but unforgettable once you've scrambled up the precipitous slopes in the shadow of towering trees, dodged deer and leaped deep ravines in a single bound. And that's in the fairway. The front nine is so wide open it's boring. The backside seems to have been designed by a mountain goat. Not a flat lie in the place, but one spectacular vista after another, not to mention almost comically devious golfing challenges.

Services at the course include a large putting green, snack bar, and golf school.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, ''National Geographic Traveler: Washington, D.C.,'' 2008, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Players have criticized the maintenance of the course in the past. However, at least one reviewer says that Rock Creek's "weedy fairways, shaggy greens, &lt;nowiki&gt;[and]&lt;/nowiki&gt; no frills" clubhouse is "honest" municipal golf.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, ''Why Golf?: The Mystery of the Game Revisited,'' 2002, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Rock Creek Park was established on September 27, 1890.  In January 1905, citizens in the [[Brightwood, Washington, D.C.|Brightwood]] neighborhood proposed building a golf course in Rock Creek Park.&lt;ref&gt;"Col. Biddle Wins Praise," ''Washington Post,'' January 19, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], which controlled the city and the parks within it at the time, approved the plan in November 1906 (although there was opposition, which believed money should be spent on [[public health]] project first).&lt;ref&gt;"Public Golf Links Soon," ''Washington Post,'' November 3, 1906; "Provide Free Sports," ''Washington Post,'' November 6, 1906; "Oppose New Golf Course," ''Washington Post,'' December 23, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in 1907, and a nine-hole course opened on July 1, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;"Golf Course to Be Ideal," ''Washington Post,'' September 1, 1907; "Only A Half Course," ''Washington Post,'' May 8, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; The course's first clubhouse was a former farm house owned by Horatio Plant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scribe Golfers Have High Aspirations|work=The Evening Star|date=April 22, 1923|page=70|accessdate=February 26, 2018|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1923-04-22/ed-1/seq-70/}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and its first concessionaires were N.B. Frost and H.D. Miller.&lt;ref&gt;West, "Rock Creek Links Concessions Let," ''Washington Post,'' March 8, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; After a year, the concession was turned over to Severine G. Leoffler, Sr.&lt;ref name="Whittlesey"&gt;Whittlesey, "'New Deal' Is Planned For Golfers," ''Washington Post,'' December 31, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; His firm had first started managing Park Service courses in the city in 1921.&lt;ref name="Whittlesey" /&gt; Loeffler, who rose from extreme poverty to own a popular local restaurant and then became a noted concessionaire for the National Park Service,&lt;ref&gt;"Leoffler Bid For Links Is Low," ''Washington Post,'' December 22, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; administered Rock Creek Park Golf Course and other city golf courses for the next four decades.

Rock Creek Golf Course proved popular in its first few years.  In July 1924, the Corps of Engineers agreed to expand the course to 18 holes.&lt;ref&gt;"Plan 18-Hole Golf Course at Rock Creek," ''Washington Post,'' July 22, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; However, construction needs were so extensive that the entire course was shuttered in December 1924.&lt;ref&gt;"Rock Creek Course to Close for Repairs," ''Washington Post,'' December 28, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; The course re-opened in 1926 with all 18 holes open for play.&lt;ref name="LinksOpened"&gt;"Rock Creek's Links Are Opened," ''Washington Post,'' April 3, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; The first golfers to tee off on the new, complete course were four members of the [[United States Congress]], who hit the first ball at 5:53 AM.&lt;ref name="LinksOpened" /&gt;

Twice in the 1930s the clubhouse suffered extensive fires.  The first incident occurred in January 1933, when the clubhouse was damaged by a fire.&lt;ref&gt;"Fire Hits Clubhouse at Rock Creek Links," ''Washington Post,'' January 21, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; A larger fire burned the clubhouse to the ground in March 1937.&lt;ref&gt;"Fire Destroys Rock Creek's Golf House," ''Washington Post,'' March 18, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance of the course was a major issue in the 1940s. Golfers complained about the course so vehemently that [[United States Senate Energy Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests|U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands]] began an investigation and asked the Park Service to delay renewing the firm's contract.&lt;ref name="ExpertFinds"&gt;Walsh, "Expert Finds Faulty Golf Courses Here," ''Washington Post,'' April 3, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; A consultant strongly criticized the Leoffler firm's stewardship of the course.&lt;ref name="ExpertFinds" /&gt; The firm built a new clubhouse on the course in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Ham, Rock Creek Golf Regulars Miss Homey, Rustic Touch of Old Days," ''Washington Post,'' January 21, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1968, Leoffler told the Park Service to close the course, as it was making no money.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;

The National Park Service threatened to close Rock Creek Golf Course in 1981. The number of rounds played at Rock Creek rose from 9,500 in 1979 to 41,500 in 1980.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;Hodge, "1 of 3 Public Links in D.C. Closed," ''Washington Post,'' December 20, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; But a Park Service report concluded that the course had been allowed to seriously deteriorate since 1965, despite about $100,000 in course repairs in the past three years.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; The Leoffler company declined to renew its concessions contract in 1981, and the National Park Service said it would close the park without a new concessionaire.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; In mid-1982, however, a management team compose of local businessmen James R. Brock, Frank Coates, and William Torpey took over course management, leading to a significant increase in rounds played.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, "Smaller Public Golf Course Sought," ''Washington Post,'' September 29, 1982; "E. Potomac Park Public Golf Course Gets New Manager," ''Washington Post,'' January 5, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The new management team lasted only a year.  In late 1982, the National Park Service awarded the concession to a new company, Golf Course Specialists, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Eisen, "Golf Course to Reopen," ''Washington Post,'' April 8, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock Creek Golf Course came close to closing again in the 1990s.  The National Park Service began soliciting public input on a new master plan for Rock Creek Park, the first such document in 80 years.  The Park Service proposed four plans for comment, one of which would have closed the golf course.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, "Weighing Future of Rock Creek," ''Washington Post,'' July 27, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; After eight years of debate and study, a new master plan was adopted which retained Rock Creek Park Golf Course.&lt;ref&gt;Reel, "A Clash of Visions Over Rock Creek Park," ''Washington Post,'' June 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rugby union]] is a minor, but developing sport in [[Jordan]].

==Governing body==
Jordanian rugby is administered by [[Jordan Rugby]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jordanrugby.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607093927/http://www.jordanrugby.com/ |archivedate=7 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been recognized by the [[Jordan Olympic Committee]] since 2007.

==History==
Rugby was first introduced into Jordan by the [[British people|British]]. Since then, it has mainly been played by expatriates from the [[British Commonwealth]] and foreign workers.

Jordan maintains a close relationship with [[Arabian Gulf Rugby Football Union|AGRFU]], and their development team includes Ghaith Jalajel, a Jordanian.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agrfu.com/page.php?id=86 retrieved 5 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

There are regional teams at [[Petra University]] and elsewhere.

The [[Dubai Sevens]] has also helped stir up some interest in the sport in Arabic-speaking nations. Rugby union is quite popular in neighbouring [[Israel]], but the relations between the two nations means that there is little sporting contact between them. Jordanian rugby has its own [[rugby sevens|sevens]] and rugby 15s leagues that consists of Citadel Warriors RFC, Citadel Knights RFC, Nomads RFC, Amman Saracens and Aqaba Sharks.

===Lowest rugby match===
Jordan has hosted a rugby match at the lowest [[altitude]] ever recorded - at over 400 metres below [[sea level]] on the eastern shore of the [[Dead Sea]] on 29 October 1982.&lt;ref name=RugDis&gt;Cotton, p16&lt;/ref&gt; This was between a team representing [[Aqaba]] and [[Safi, Jordan|Safi]] and another representing [[Amman]].&lt;ref name=RugDis/&gt; The temperature at the time, was in the 90s ([[fahrenheit]]).&lt;ref name=RugDis/&gt;

==National team==
The [[Jordan national rugby union team]] is a third tier [[Rugby Union|rugby]] playing international side. Jordan played their first test match against {{nrut|Lebanon}} on 14 May 2010, in Dubai. They competed in and won the inaugural Asian 5 nations division 3 West competition in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/qualifying/news/newsid=2037324.html#arabian+gulf+with+a5n+victory {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017132103/http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/qualifying/news/newsid%3D2037324.html |date=17 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rugby Clubs in Jordan==
There are three clubs in Amman:
* Amman Citadel Rugby Club
* Nomads Rugby Club
* Amman Saracens
Outside Amman:
* Aqaba Sharks

'''Simmons Field''' is a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]. It was the home field of the [[Kenosha Comets]] of the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] (AAGPBL).

==History==

Simmons Field opened in Kenosha in 1920 as a field for the [[Simmons Bedding Company|Simmons Bedding Company's]] baseball team. The stadium's original capacity was 7,000. The park allowed for growth of the company's Simmons Bedmakers team and provided a suitable venue city’s flourishing baseball rivalries.

The concrete grandstand was re-built in 1930. By that time, however, the city’s baseball teams had begun to decline despite a Midwest League championship for the Bedmakers in 1924.

In 1947, the Simmons Company sold the field and the city made it available the following year for use by the city's [[Women's baseball|women's professional baseball]] team, the [[Kenosha Comets]]. The Comets, of the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] (AAGPBL), had played in Kenosha at Lakefront Stadium since the league was founded in 1943. The team played at Simmons Field from 1948 until its final season in 1951. The AAGPBL folded three seasons later.

Throughout the ensuing decades, Simmons Field was used by little leagues, amateur leagues and for exhibition games. [[Warren Spahn]], [[Bob Feller]] and [[Satchel Paige]] [[Pitcher|pitched]] there. The Kenosha Pirates, a local semi-pro team, also played at Simmons Field during this era. But the stadium fell into disrepair without a major tenant.

Then in 1984, Kenosha native and former [[Minor League baseball|minor league]] pitcher [[Bob Lee (baseball)|Bob Lee]] transformed the old venue when he purchased the [[Minnesota Twins]] [[Single-A (baseball)|Single-A]] [[Midwest League]] affiliate and moved the team into Simmons Field. The move provided for approximately $350,000 worth of improvements to the field, including a new clubhouse, new in-ground dugouts, a new wood outfield fence, a new electronic scoreboard, concession facilities and aluminum bleachers along the third base line.

The Kenosha Twins played at Simmons Field for nine years, winning two Midwest League championships and producing more than a dozen major league players, including four players on the [[1991 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins 1991 World Championship team]]. That World Championship team included [[American League]] [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] [[Chuck Knoblauch]] and long-time Kenosha resident and former [[University of Wisconsin–Parkside]] head baseball coach [[Jarvis Brown]], who played for the Kenosha Twins in 1987 and 1988. Current [[Carthage College]] head baseball coach Augie Schmidt also played at Simmons for the Twins in 1986, before retiring from professional baseball.

In July 1991, [[Chicago Cubs]] legend [[Rick Sutcliffe]] pitched nine innings in an injury rehab start for the [[Peoria Chiefs]] against the Twins at Simmons Field. A crowd of 4,387 attended that game{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, producing the largest crowd of the Bob Lee-era at Simmons. However, a decline in overall attendance and higher standards for minor league baseball facilities forced Lee to sell the team after the 1991 season. New ownership moved the team to [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] after the 1992 season.

The Kenosha Kings, a local semi-pro team, also took up residence at Simmons Field in 1984. The Kings currently compete in the Wisconsin State League and won the league’s championship in 2006. The Kings are in their 25th consecutive season at the stadium, the longest run of any team during the history of the ballpark.

During the 1990s, Simmons Field was home to amateur teams of high school and college talents, as well as the Kings. The locally-run Kenosha Chiefs semi-pro team also was the stadium’s primary tenant in 1993, and the Kenosha Kroakers of the [[List of collegiate summer baseball leagues|collegiate summer]] [[Northwoods League]] called Simmons home from 1994 to 1999.

In June 1998, [[Green Bay Packers]] players also appeared at Simmons Field for a charity [[softball]] game that also drew thousands of fans. And in August 1999, chart-topping pop group [['N Sync]] also played a charity softball game at Simmons in front of roughly 2,800 fans.

In 2000, AAGPBL players returned to Simmons Field for a reunion and dozens of the former players dedicated a plaque to commemorate the AAGPBL’s time in Kenosha.

Simmons Field was home to professional baseball once more in 2003 when the [[Dubois County Dragons]] of the independent [[Frontier League]] moved and became the [[Kenosha Mammoths]]. However, the Mammoths failed to attract large crowds and the team moved again after one season in Kenosha.

In 2007 the Kenosha Parks Department leased Simmons Field to the Kenosha Unified School District (KUSD). KUSD has since leased the field to the Kenosha Simmons Baseball Organization (KSBO), a non-profit group working to upgrade and restore the stadium. Initial improvements included a rebuilt infield, which was completed in the fall of 2007, and a new electronic scoreboard behind left field.

In July 2008 the [[Men's Senior Baseball League]] (MSBL) of Kenosha organized the 2008 Women’s Hall of Fame Classic. This event hosted a large contingency of the AAGPBL players in a rededication of Simmons Field to women’s baseball. The event provided the best female baseball players in the country the opportunity to tryout for positions on the US team competing in the 2008 World Cup Games in Japan. The event was capped off with a five team international women’s baseball tournament featuring the Aussie Hearts, Chicago Pioneers, Nashua Pride, New England Red Sox and Washington Stars. The tournament was won by the Aussie Hearts coached by Kenosha native Rob Novotny.

==Current use==

Simmons Field is the home of the [[Kenosha Kingfish]], who played their first season in the summer of 2014. The Kenosha Kingfish are one of 18 teams in the [[Northwoods League]], a minor-league style collegiate, summer league of college baseball players from across the nation. The Kingfish administration renovated Historic Simmons Field in 2013. The newly renovated stadium has over 2,100 seats, obtained from [[Oriole_Park_at_Camden_Yards|Camden Yards]], contains two Home Plate Suites, a party deck, and a general admission lawn seating area.

'''Gradski vrt''' (''City Garden'') is a multi-use stadium in the [[Croatia]]n city of [[Osijek]]. It is home to two Croatian [[association football|football]] clubs, [[NK Osijek]] and Fortuna VNO Osijek.

It has a capacity of 18,856 (17,876 for seating and 980 for standing).

== History ==
Construction started in 1949, but works were stopped several times. The first match played on the ground of Gradski Vrt was played between [[NK Osijek]] and [[FK Sloboda Tuzla]] on 7 September 1958. In 1980, the stadium was officially opened.

In 1982, the record of stadium attendance was broken, on the football match between [[NK Osijek]] and [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]]. At that match, there were 40,000 attendants. The result was 1–2.

In 1998 seats and reflectors were installed. In 2005, the stadium was renovated. Under the west stand, VIP rooms were set and the lodge was rearranged, adding 1,000 new seats. The athletics track was reconstructed, repainted from red to blue. After this renovation, the stadium has fulfilled [[UEFA]]'s stadium criteria. In the same year, the stadium was a part of [[Croatia]] and [[Hungary]]'s failed bid for the [[2012 European Football Championship]]. At that time a project of a new stadium with a larger capacity was presented.

In 2010, the stadium was again repaired: the pitch was relaid, fences were painted and the seats were numbered. The reason was a friendly match between [[Croatian national football team|Croatia]] and [[Wales national football team|Wales]], which was held on 23 May that year.

In May 2016, the stadium hosted the [[Croatian Football Cup|Croatian Cup]] final.

==Future==
In April 2018, [[NK Osijek]] President Ivan Meštrović released a detailed structure design for the new stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nk-osijek.hr/vijesti/14949/prestali-smo-sanjati-poceli-smo-zivjeti/|title="PRESTALI SMO SANJATI, POČELI SMO ŽIVJETI!"|website=NK Osijek official website}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new state of art stadium will be built at the Pampas neighbourhood in [[Osijek]] as a part of the new NK Osijek training centre. The capacity of the new stadium will be 12,000, with all of the seats covered. The stadium will be UEFA [[UEFA stadium categories|category four]] and is supposed to be finished in 2020. During the stadium construction, [[NK Osijek]] will play their home games at the current [[Gradski vrt]] stadium, which is in the future going to be used as the main stadium for the [[NK Osijek]] B squad.

The '''Victoria Ground''' was the home ground of [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] from 1878 until 1997, when the club relocated to the [[Britannia Stadium]] after 119 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stokecity.rivals.net/default.asp?sid=944&amp;p=2&amp;stid=8382833|title= The Story Of The Victoria Ground|author=Gareth Cooper|date=9 June 2005|accessdate=29 June 2007|work=[[The Oatcake (Fanzine)|The Oatcake]] - oatcake.co.uk |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070508191208/http://stokecity.rivals.net/default.asp?sid=944&amp;p=2&amp;stid=8382833 |archivedate = 8 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its demolition it was  the oldest operational football league ground in [[the Football League]].&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Tony|title=The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City|year=1994|publisher=Lion Press|isbn=0-9524151-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:Woolwich Arsenal v. Newcastle United, April 1906.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Victoria Ground hosted seven [[FA Cup semi-finals]], one of these was this in 1906, between [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].]]
The Victoria Ground had been Stoke City's home since March 1878 and the first match was a friendly against [[Talke]] Rangers on 28 March 1878, Stoke won 1–0 before 2,500 spectators.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; The ground took its name from the nearby Victoria Hotel and was originally an oval shape, built to accommodate a running track and used by the local athletic club.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; There was an open grass bank at each end, and a small but compact wooden stand on the east side (Boothen Road) capable of housing 1,000 people.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; Opposite this stand was another bank which could hold 4,000. The ground remained this way for 30 years during which time Stoke had become members of [[the Football League]].&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; Stoke suffered financial difficulties and dropped out of the league in 1908 and attendances varied during their time out.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; Stoke got back into the league in 1919 and the ground had now been improved considerably. There were two good sized grandstands and an extra wooden one which was situated opposite the main stand and could hold 1,000 supporters.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt;

The players changing rooms were set in the corner of the ground which also included a stove so players could keep warm.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; Above the changing 'hut' was the directors box, a rather primitive building but could hold around 12 people. During the early 1920s a new, mainly wooden main stand was erected alongside the 'hut' and this could hold 2,000 fans.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; By 1930 Stoke had added 'City' to their name and the Boothen End was terraced and later covered, and consequently the ground lost its oval shape.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; 1935, when the likes of [[Stanley Matthews]] was beginning to draw in the crowds, the Butler Street Stand was built, giving seating to 5,000 people.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; In front of the seats was a small paddock, room for another 2,000 and it took the ground capacity to around the 45,000 mark.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; A record crowd of 51,380 packed into the Victoria Ground on 29 March 1937 to watch a [[Football League First Division|First Division]] match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; During [[World War II]] the Butler Street Stand was used as an army storage camp.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; 

Floodlights were installed at the ground in 1956 and [[Potteries derby|local rivals]] [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] marked the 'official' switching on ceremony by playing Stoke in a friendly on 10 October 1956.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; In 1960 another new main stand was built and the dressing rooms were revamped.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; In the summer of 1963 concrete was laid on the paddock terracing and it was the Stoke players who helped lay it as part of a team bonding scheme.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; More improvements continued in the 1960s and the ground remained in a good condition until January 1976.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt;

Over the weekend of the 3/4 January 1976, with Stoke playing [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] away in the [[FA Cup]], winds of hurricane force battered the [[Stoke-on-Trent]] area and especially the Victoria Ground for around eight hours. The strong winds blew a section of the roof off the Butler Street Stand leaving only the west corner intact.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; Top priority was to put the roof back in order that the replay against Tottenham could take place on 7 January.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; However, on the day of the match as workmen were replacing timber supports and erecting scaffolding, some of the supports collapsed and a number of workers were injured, The match itself was cancelled on safety grounds.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; Stoke had to play one home league match against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] at [[Vale Park]] on 17 January and the Victoria Ground was reopened by 24 January in time for Stoke to play Tottenham in the cup.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt;

The final improvements to the ground were made during the 1980s with the [[Stanley Matthews]] suite being opened as well as a new club shop and offices.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; 

With the [[Taylor Report]] of January 1990 requiring all clubs in the top two division of English football have an all-seater stadium by August 1994, the club drew up plans to meet the requirements at the Victoria Ground, in spite of relegation to the Third Division in 1990, as the club was intent on re-establishing itself in the top two divisions - which was achieved three years later.

However, after a few years, Stoke chairman [[Peter Coates]] instead decided to move the club to a new location and so in 1997 Stoke left the Victoria Ground after 119 years for the new 28,000-seater [[Britannia Stadium]] at Trentham Lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Britannia Stadium|url=http://www.stokecityfc.com/page/BritanniaStadium/0,,10310~71103,00.html|work=Stoke City F.C.|accessdate=19 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229154748/http://www.stokecityfc.com/page/BritanniaStadium/0%2C%2C10310~71103%2C00.html|archive-date=29 February 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
