'''Basal body temperature''' ('''BBT''' or '''BTP''') is the lowest [[body temperature]] attained during rest (usually during sleep). It is usually estimated by a temperature measurement immediately after awakening and before any physical activity has been undertaken. This will lead to a somewhat higher value than the true BBT. 

In women, [[ovulation]] causes a sustained increase of at least {{Convert|0.2|C-change|F-change|sigfig=1}} in BBT.  Monitoring BBTs is one way of estimating the day of ovulation.  The tendency of a woman to have lower temperatures before ovulation, and higher temperatures afterwards, is known as a [[Wikt:biphasic|biphasic]] temperature pattern.  Charting this pattern may be used as a component of [[fertility awareness]]. The BBT of men is comparable to the BBT of women in their [[follicular phase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sleep and 24 hour body temperatures: a comparison in young men, naturally cycling women and women taking hormonal contraceptives|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.0565k.x/abstract|journal = The Journal of Physiology|date = 2001-02-01|issn = 1469-7793|pmc = 2278431|pmid = 11158285|pages = 565–574|volume = 530|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.0565k.x|first = Fiona C.|last = Baker|first2 = Jonathan I.|last2 = Waner|first3 = Elizabeth F.|last3 = Vieira|first4 = Sheila R.|last4 = Taylor|first5 = Helen S.|last5 = Driver|first6 = Duncan|last6 = Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hormonal causes of biphasic patterns==
The higher levels of [[estrogen]] present during the pre-ovulatory (follicular) phase of the [[menstrual cycle]] lower BBTs.  The higher levels of [[progesterone]] released by the [[corpus luteum]] after ovulation raise BBTs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUMIAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=145#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Textbook of Clinical Embryology|last=Coward|first=Kevin|last2=Wells|first2=Dagan|date=2013-10-31|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521166409|location=|pages=145, 156|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After ovulation, the temperature will be raised by at least {{Convert|0.2|C-change|F-change|sigfig=1}}, for at least 72 hours, compared to the previous six days.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The rise in temperatures can most commonly be seen the day after ovulation, but this varies and BBTs can only be used to estimate ovulation within a three-day range.{{mcn|date=December 2017}}

If pregnancy does not occur, the disintegration of the corpus luteum causes a drop in BBTs that roughly coincides with the onset of the next menstruation.  If pregnancy does occur, the corpus luteum continues to function (and maintain high BBTs) for the first trimester of the pregnancy.  After the first trimester, the woman's body temperature drops to her pre-ovulatory normal as the placenta takes over functions previously performed by the corpus luteum.{{mcn|date=December 2017}}

Very rarely, the corpus luteum may form a [[cyst]].  A corpus luteum cyst will cause BBTs to stay elevated and prevent [[menstruation]] from occurring until it resolves, which could take weeks or months.{{mcn|date=December 2017}}

==As a birth control method==

===While avoiding pregnancy===
Charting of basal body temperatures is used in some methods of fertility awareness, such as the [[sympto-thermal method]], and may be used to determine the onset of post-ovulatory infertility.{{fact|date=December 2017}}  When BBT alone is used to avoid a pregnancy, it is sometimes called the Temperature Rhythm method.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;

Basal body temperature alone is most effective at preventing pregnancy if the couple abstains from intercourse from the beginning of menstruation through the third day after the basal body temperature has risen.&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/871619675|title=Williams Obstetrics|last=Cunningham|first=F. Gary|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education/Medical;|others=|year=2014|isbn=9780071798938|edition=24th|location=New York|pages=696, 713|oclc=871619675}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BBTs only show when ovulation has occurred; they do not predict ovulation.  Sperm typically lasts for at least three days and can survive as long as a week,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; making prediction of ovulation several days in advance necessary for avoiding pregnancy.

===Effectiveness===
There is limited evidence about the effectiveness of [[fertility awareness]] family planning methods, some of which use basal body temperature as one component.&lt;ref name="cochrane"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Family planning with methods based on fertility awareness {{!}} Cochrane|vauthors=Grimes DA, Gallo MF, Halpern V, Nanda K, Schulz KF, Lopez LM|url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD004860/FERTILREG_family-planning-with-methods-based-on-fertility-awareness|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004860.pub2|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About 24% of women who use any type of fertility awareness program become pregnant during the first year, compared to about 85% of sexually active women who are not trying to prevent a pregnancy.&lt;ref name=trussell&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trussell|first=James|year=2011|title=Contraceptive failure in the United States|journal=Contraception|volume=83|issue=5|pages=397–404|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.01.021|issn=0010-7824|pmc=3638209|pmid=21477680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] ranked fertility awareness methods, taken as a whole, as an "effective" method of preventing pregnancies.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt; The WHO placed fertility awareness methods in the third tier of effectiveness, after "most effective" methods such as [[IUDs]] and "very effective" methods such as [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|combined oral contraceptive pills]].&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/776090067|title=Family planning : a global handbook for providers : evidence-based guidance developed through worldwide collaboration.|date=2011|publisher=Johns Hopkins, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Center for Communication Programs, INFO Project|others=United States. Agency for International Development. Office of Population and Reproductive Health., World Health Organization. Reproductive Health and Research., Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Center for Communication Program.|isbn=9780978856304|location=Baltimore|oclc=776090067}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Trying to conceive==
Couples that are trying to conceive can use BBT to determine when the opportunity for a pregnancy during this cycle has passed.

==As a diagnostic test==

=== For infertility ===
Infertility due to lack of ovulation is common.  BBT charts can be used to identify when and whether ovulation is taking place.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Regular menstrual cycles are often taken as evidence that a woman is ovulating normally, and irregular cycles is evidence she is not.  However, many women with irregular cycles do ovulate normally, and some with regular cycles are actually [[anovulatory]] or have a [[luteal phase defect]].  Records of basal [[Human body temperature|body temperature]] can be used to accurately determine if a woman is ovulating,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKSZBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40|title=Taylor’s Family Medicine Review|last=Taylor|first=Robert B.|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9781461221524|location=|pages=40|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if the length of the post-ovulatory (luteal) phase of her menstrual cycle is long enough to sustain a pregnancy.{{mcn|date=December 2017}}

=== For pregnancy ===
Most [[pregnancy test]]s are not accurate until two weeks after ovulation.  Knowing an estimated date of ovulation can prevent a woman from getting false negative results due to testing too early.  Also, 18 consecutive days of elevated temperatures means a woman is almost certainly pregnant.{{mcn|date=December 2017}}

== For estimating the timing of childbirth ==
Calculating the [[Estimated date of confinement|expected due date]] for a pregnancy based upon the self-reported [[last menstrual period]] is less accurate than calculating it based upon either BBT or ultrasound.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Parkinson's disease]]''' (PD) is a [[degenerative disease|degenerative disorder]] of the [[central nervous system]].  Most people with PD have [[idiopathic]] Parkinson's disease (having no specific known cause). A small proportion of cases, however, can be attributed to known [[genetics|genetic]] factors. Other factors such as environmental toxins, herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides, have been associated with the risk of developing PD, but no causal relationships have been proven.

== Genetic factors ==

Traditionally, PD has been considered a non-genetic disorder. However, around 15% of individuals with PD have a [[Consanguinity|first-degree relative]] who has the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samii|first=A|author2=Nutt, JG |author3=Ransom, BR |title=Parkinson's disease.|journal=Lancet|date=May 29, 2004|volume=363|issue=9423|pages=1783–93|pmid=15172778|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16305-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 5% -15%  of cases are known to occur because of a [[mutation]] in one of several specific genes, transmitted in either an [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal-dominant or autosomal-recessive pattern]]&lt;ref name=lesage&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lesage S, Brice A |title=Parkinson's disease: from monogenic forms to genetic susceptibility factors |journal=Hum.

Mutations in specific genes have been conclusively shown to cause PD. Genes which have been implicated in autosomal-dominant PD include PARK1 and PARK4, PARK5, PARK8, PARK11 and GIGYF2 and PARK13 which code for [[alpha-synuclein]](SNCA), UCHL1, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ([[LRRK2]] or dardarin) ([[LRRK2]] and [[HtrA serine peptidase 2|Htra2]] respectively&lt;ref name=lesage/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larsen|first=S.

Furthermore, mutations in genes including those that code for SNCA, LRRK2 and [[glucocerebrosidase]] (GBA) have been found to be risk factors for sporadic PD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neumann|first=J|author2=Bras J|author3=Deas E|author4=O'Sullivan SS|author5=Parkkinen L|author6=Lachmann RH|author7=Li A|author8=Holton J|author9=Guerreiro R|author10=Paudel R|author11=Segarane B|author12=Singleton A|author13=Lees A|author14=Hardy J|author15=Houlden H|author16=Revesz T|author17= Wood NW.|title=Glucocerebrosidase mutations in clinical and pathologically proven Parkinson's disease|journal=Brain|date=March 2009|volume=132|issue=7|pages=1783–94|pmid=19286695|doi=10.1093/brain/awp044|pmc=2702833}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, people with these mutations will develop PD. With the exception of LRRK2, however, they account for only a small minority of cases of PD.&lt;ref name="Davie 2008 109–27"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davie|first=CA|title=A review of Parkinson's disease.|journal=British Medical Bulletin|year=2008|volume=86|pages=109–27|doi=10.1093/bmb/ldn013|pmid=18398010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most extensively studied PD-related genes are SNCA and LRRK2.

=== SNCA gene ===

The role of the SNCA gene is significant in PD because the alpha-synuclein protein is the main component of [[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]], which appear as a primary biomarker in the disease.&lt;ref name=lesage/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhungel|first=Nripesh|last2=Eleuteri|first2=Simona|last3=Li|first3=Ling-bo|last4=Kramer|first4=Nicholas J.|last5=Chartron|first5=Justin W.|last6=Spencer|first6=Brian|last7=Kosberg|first7=Kori|last8=Fields|first8=Jerel Adam|last9=Stafa|first9=Klodjan|date=2015-01-07|title=Parkinson's Disease Genes VPS35 and EIF4G1 Interact Genetically and Converge on α-Synuclein|journal=Neuron|language=English|volume=85|issue=1|pages=76–87|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2014.11.027|issn=0896-6273|pmc=4289081|pmid=25533483}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Missense mutation]]s of the gene (in which a single [[nucleotide]] is changed), and [[Gene duplication|duplications]] and triplications of the [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] containing it have been found in different groups with familial PD.&lt;ref name=lesage/&gt; Level of alpha-synuclein expression correlates with disease onset and progression, with SNCA gene triplication advancing earlier and faster than duplication.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=I|date=Sep 2011|title=Recent Advances in the Genetics of Parkinson's Disease.|journal=Annu.

=== LRRK2 gene ===
The LRRK2 gene (PARK8) encodes for a protein called [[dardarin]]. The name dardarin was taken from a [[Basque language|Basque]] word for tremor, because this gene was first identified in families from England and the north of Spain.&lt;ref name="Davie 2008 109–27"/&gt; A significant number of autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease cases are associated with mutations in the LRRK2 gene&lt;ref name="Funayama 296–301"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Funayama|first=M|date=March 2002|title=A new locus for Parkinson's disease (PARK8) maps to chromosome 12p11.2-q13.1.|journal=Annals of Neurology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=296–301|doi=10.1002/ana.10113|pmid=11891824|author2=Hasegawa K|author3=Kowa H|author4=Saito M|author5=Tsuji S|author6=Obata F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common known cause of familial and sporadic PD, accounting for approximately 5% of individuals with a family history of the disease and 3% of sporadic cases.&lt;ref name=lesage/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davie 2008 109–27"/&gt; There are many different mutations described in LRRK2, however unequivocal proof of causation only exists for a small number.&lt;ref name=lesage/&gt; Mutations in PINK1, PRKN, and DJ-1 may cause mitochondrial dysfunction, an element of both idiopathic and genetic PD.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; Of related interest are mutations in the progranulin gene that have been found to cause corticobasal degeneration seen in dementia.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen-Plotkin|first=AS|author2=Martinez-Lage, M |author3=Sleiman, PMA |author4=Hu, W |date=Apr 2011|title=Genetic and Clinical Features of Progranulin-Associated Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration.|journal=Arch.

=== GBA gene ===

Mutations in GBA are known to cause [[Gaucher's disease]].&lt;ref name=lesage/&gt; [[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association studies]], which search for mutated [[allele]]s with low penetrance in sporadic cases, have now yielded many positive results.&lt;ref name=IPDGC&gt;{{cite journal |author=IPDGC |title=Imputation of sequence variants for identification of genetic risks for Parkinson's disease: a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies |journal=Lancet |volume=377 |pages= 641–649|year=2011 |pmid= 21292315 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62345-8 |issue=9766 |last2=Nalls |first2=MA |last3=Plagnol |first3=V|last4=Hernandez |first4=DG |last5=Sharma |first5=M |last6=Sheerin |first6=UM |last7=Saad |first7=M |last8=Simón-Sánchez|first8=J |last9=Schulte |first9=C |last10=Lesage |first10=S |last11=Sveinbjörnsdóttir |first11=S |last12=Stefánsson |first12=K |last13=Martinez |first13=M |last14=Hardy |first14=J |last15=Heutink |first15=P |last16=Brice |first16=A |last17=Gasser |first17=T |last18=Singleton |first18=A.

[[Lead]], which was used in gasoline until 1995 and paint until 1978, is known to damage the nervous system in various ways.&lt;ref name="goldman2014" /&gt; A few studies have found that people with high levels of lead in their body had twice the risk of Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name="goldman2014" /&gt; Epidemiological studies on lead, however, have found little evidence for a link with Parkinson's.&lt;ref name="goldman2014" /&gt; [[Iron]] has been implicated in the etiology of Parkinson's disease, but there is no strong evidence that environmental exposure to it is associated with Parkinson's.&lt;ref name="goldman2014" /&gt;

===Head injuries===
A study in 2018 notes that "Even a mild head injury, commonly called a concussion, makes veterans more likely to get Parkinson's disease later on in life" with this being "the same type of injury suffered by many Americans on the sports field or in a motor vehicle crash each year."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://abcnews.go.com/Health/mild-head-injury-increases-risk-parkinsons-disease-veterans/story?id=54563248 | title=Even a mild head injury increases risk for Parkinson's disease, veterans study shows| date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier study, published in 2012, suggests that playing in the NFL triples the risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/09/05/playing-in-nfl-triples-risk-of-alzheimers-parkinsons-diseases&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exercise ===
While many environmental factors may exacerbate Parkinson's Disease, exercise is considered to be one of the main protective factors for neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson disease. The types of exercise interventions that have been studied can be categorized as either aerobic or goal-based.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Petzinger GM, Fisher BE, McEwen S, Beeler JA, Walsh JP, Jakowec MW. Exercise-enhanced neuroplasticity targeting motor and cognitive circuitry in Parkinson’s disease. The Lancet Neurology. 2013;12(7):716-726. doi:10.1016/S1474-4422(13)70123-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Aerobic exercise includes physical activity that increases the heart rate. Aerobic exercise is beneficial to the overall brain through mechanisms that promote neuroplasticity, or the rewiring of the brain circuitry.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Goal-based exercises are often developed with the guidance of a physical therapist to use movement to improve motor task performance and enhance motor learning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; While exercise has consistently been shown to be beneficial, the optimal interventional benefit is still being researched.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin VA, Richards SH, Taylor RS, Taylor AH, Campbell JL.

=== Caffeine Consumption ===
Studies have been done with groups of people where individuals (smokers and nonsmokers) with different rates of caffeine consumption were monitored for their susceptibility to PD. The results of these findings indicated that higher coffee/caffeine intake is associated with a significantly lower incidence of PD and that this effect appeared to be independent of smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Tsuboi, Y.

=== Polymorphism of CYP2D6 gene and pesticide exposure ===
The [[CYP2D6]] gene is primarily expressed in the liver and is responsible for the enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6. A study showed that those who had a mutation of this gene and were exposed to pesticides were twice as likely to develop Parkinson's Disease; those that had the mutation and were not exposed to pesticides were not found to be at an increased risk of developing PD; the pesticides only had a "modest effect" for those without the mutation of the gene.&lt;ref name="Tsuboi 123–128"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elbaz|first=Alexis|last2=Levecque|first2=Clotilde|last3=Clavel|first3=Jacqueline|last4=Vidal|first4=Jean-Sébastien|last5=Richard|first5=Florence|last6=Amouyel|first6=Philippe|last7=Alpérovitch|first7=Annick|last8=Chartier-Harlin|first8=Marie-Christine|last9=Tzourio|first9=Christophe|date=2004-03-01|title=CYP2D6 polymorphism, pesticide exposure, and Parkinson's disease|journal=Annals of Neurology|language=en|volume=55|issue=3|pages=430–434|doi=10.1002/ana.20051|pmid=14991823|issn=1531-8249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cerebral creatine deficiencies (CCD)'''  are a small group of inherited disorders that result from defects in [[creatine]] biosynthesis and utilization.  Commonly affected tissues include the brain and muscles.  There are three distinct CCDs.  The most common is [[creatine transporter defect]] (CTD), an X-linked disorder caused by pathogenic variants in ''SLC6A8''. The main symptoms of CTD are intellectual disability and developmental delay, and these are caused by a lack of creatine in the brain, due to the defective transporter.  There are also two enzymatic defects of creatine biosynthesis, [[arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency]] (AGAT deficiency), caused by variants in ''[[GATM (gene)|GATM]]'' and [[guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency]] (GAMT deficiency), caused by variants in ''[[GAMT]]''.  The single enzyme defects are both inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] manner.&lt;ref name=ccdreview&gt;{{Cite journal

==Introduction==
Creatine is synthesized in the kidney and liver, by a two step enzymatic process.  In the first step, glycine and arginine are combined by [[arginine:glycine amidinotransferase]] to form [[guanidinoacetate]].  This step also results in the production of [[ornithine]].  Creatine is produced by the enzyme [[guanidinoacetate methyltransferase]].  After production in the liver and kidneys, creatine is transported to organs and tissues with high energy demands, most commonly the brain and skeletal muscles.  In addition to endogenous production, creatine can be obtained from dietary sources or supplementation.

==Signs and symptoms==
The clinical findings in all three CCDs result from the consequences of decreased levels of creatine in tissues where it is required.  The two tissues with the highest demands for creatine are the brain and skeletal muscles.  Muscular findings usually include weakness and decreased endurance.  Other clinical findings include seizures, intellectual disability and developmental delay.  Most affected individuals appear normal at birth, with clinical findings becoming apparent during the first year of life, and progressing.

==Pathogenesis==
Creatine is synthesized primarily in the liver and kidneys via a two-step enzymatic process.  Defects in either of these two enzymes can cause a CCD.  In order to pass the [[blood brain barrier]], creatine requires a specialized transporter, encoded for by ''SLC6A8''.  A defect in this transporter is responsible for the third CCD.

'''Chronic atrophic rhinitis''' is a chronic [[inflammation]] of [[Human nose|nose]] characterised by [[atrophy]] of [[Mucus|nasal mucosa]], including the glands, [[turbinate bones]] and the nerve elements supplying the nose. Chronic atrophic rhinitis may be primary and secondary. Special forms of chronic atrophic rhinitis are [[rhinitis sicca anterior]] and ozaena.

==Signs and symptoms==
* most commonly seen in females
* reported among patients from lower socioeconomic groups.&lt;ref name="pmid16354334"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dutt SN, Kameswaran M |title=The aetiology and management of atrophic rhinitis |journal=J Laryngol Otol |volume=119 |issue=11 |pages=843–52 |date=November 2005  |pmid=16354334 |doi=10.1258/002221505774783377 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10567992"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bunnag C, Jareoncharsri P, Tansuriyawong P, Bhothisuwan W, Chantarakul N |title=Characteristics of atrophic rhinitis in Thai patients at the Siriraj Hospital |journal=Rhinology |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=125–30 |date=September 1999  |pmid=10567992 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The nasal cavities become rheumy and are filled with foul smelling crusts which are black or dark green and dry, making expiration painful and difficult. 
* Microorganisms are known to multiply and produce a foul smell from the nose, though the patients may not be aware of this, because their elements (responsible for the perception of smell) have become atrophied. This is called [[merciful anosmia]].
* Patients usually complain of nasal obstruction despite the roomy nasal cavity, which can be caused either by the obstruction produced by the discharge in the nose, or as a result of sensory loss due to atrophy of nerves in the nose, so the patient is unaware of the air flow.  In the case of the second cause, the sensation of obstruction is subjective. 
* Bleeding from the nose, also called epistaxis, may occur when the dried discharge (crusts) are removed. 
* Septal perforation and dermatitis of [[nasal vestibule]] can occur. The nose may show a saddle-nose deformity. 
* Atrophic rhinitis is also associated with similar atrophic changes in the [[pharynx]] or [[larynx]], producing symptoms pertaining to these structures. Hearing impairment can occur due to [[Eustachian tube]] blockage causing [[middle ear]] effusion.

Permanent loss of smell and impairment of taste may also be a result of this disease, even after the symptoms are cured.

== Etiology ==
Causes can be remembered by mnemonic '''HERNIA''':
* [[Heredity|Hereditary]] factors: the disease runs in  families
* [[Endocrine]] imbalance: the disease tends to start at puberty and mostly involves females
* [[Racial]] factors: white people are more susceptible than natives of equatorial Africa 
* [[Nutrition]]al deficiency: vitamins A or D, or iron{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
* [[Infection]]: ''[[Klebsiella]] ozaenae'', [[Corynebacterium|diphtheroids]], ''[[Proteus vulgaris]]'', [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']], etc.
* [[Autoimmune]] factors: viral infection or some other unidentified insult may trigger antigenicity of the nasal mucosa.

===Secondary atrophic rhinitis===
Specific infections, such as [[syphilis]], lupus, [[leprosy]] and [[rhinoscleroma]], may cause destruction of the nasal structures leading to atrophic changes. Atrophic rhinitis can also result from long-standing purulent [[sinusitis]] or [[radiotherapy]] of the nose, or as a complication of surgery of the [[turbinates]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=deShazo|first=Richard D.|last2=Stringer|first2=Scott P.|date=2011-02-01|title=Atrophic rhinosinusitis: progress toward explanation of an unsolved medical mystery|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e328342333e|issn=1473-6322|pmid=21157302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom [[National Health Service]] has stated that "Most cases of atrophic rhinitis in the UK occur when the turbinates are damaged or removed during surgery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Rhinitis---non-allergic/Pages/Causes.aspx|title=Non-allergic rhinitis - Causes - NHS Choices|last=Choices|first=NHS|website=www.nhs.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors refer to as Atrophic rhinitis secondary to sinus surgery as the [[empty nose syndrome]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Unilateral atrophic rhinitis===
Extreme deviation of nasal septum may be accompanied by atrophic rhinitis on the wider side.

==Pathology==
* The ciliated columnar epithelium of the nasal mucosa is replaced by stratified squamous epithelium. 
* Atrophy of mucosa, turbinal bones and seromucinous glands tends to occur, due to obliterative endoarteritis causing decreased blood supply, hence the supplying area atrophies.
* Arrested development of paranasal sinuses.
==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=December 2017}}

==Treatment==
Treatment of atrophic rhinitis can be either medical or surgical.

Medical measures include:
*Nasal irrigation using normal saline&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Nasal irrigation and removal of crusts using alkaline nasal solutions prepared by dissolving a spoonful of powder containing one part sodium bicarbonate, one part sodium biborate and two part sodium chloride.
*25% glucose in glycerine can be applied to the nasal mucosa to inhibit the growth of proteolytic organisms which produce foul smell.
*Local antibiotics, such as [[Chloramphenicol|chloromycetine]].
*[[Vitamin D]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Kemicetine).
*Estradiol spray for regeneration of seromucinous glands and vascularization of mucosa.
*Systemic streptomycin (1g/day) against Klebsiella organisms.
*Oral potassium iodide for liquefaction of secretion.
*Placental extract injected in the submucosa.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Surgical interventions include:
*[[Young's operation]].
*Modified Young's operation.
*Narrowing of nasal cavities, submucosal injection of Teflon paste, section and medial displacement of the lateral wall of the nose.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
*Transposition of parotid duct to maxillary sinus or nasal mucosa.

== History ==
This disorder was known since the time of ancient Egypt, almost 4,000 years ago, and descriptions of it are found in the historical medical papyri. In the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] (1700 BC) it was prescribed a treatment based on wine and breast milk to cure this disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ancient Greek and Indian civilizations were aware of atrophic rhinitis.&lt;ref name="pmid8820180"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shehata MA |title=Atrophic rhinitis |journal=Am J Otolaryngol |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=81–6 |year=1996 |pmid=8820180 |doi= 10.1016/s0196-0709(96)90000-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chronic disease in Northern Ontario''' is a [[population health]] problem.  The population in [[Northern Ontario]] experiences worse outcomes on a number of important health indicators, including higher rates of [[chronic disease]] compared to the population in the rest of [[Ontario]] (Romanow, 2002).

==Population under consideration==

Northern Ontario is over 800,000 square kilometers, covering nearly 90% of the area of Ontario. Its population of close to 800,000 represents only 6% of the total population for the province. This large land area and relatively small population results in a density of approximately one person per square kilometre, compared to 115 persons per square kilometre in Southern Ontario. Northern Ontario's rural population comprises more than 30% of the total Northern population. In Southern Ontario, only 11% of the population lives in rural area. Over 50% of the North's population live in the five biggest cities of [[Thunder Bay]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Timmins]], [[Greater Sudbury]], and [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]]. With mining, forestry and tourism as the major local industries, there are peaks and troughs in the economy, and unemployment rates are usually higher than in the remainder of Ontario (MNDM, 2011).

The estimated area of [[Local Health Integration Network]] (LHIN) 13 is 400,000 square kilometres or approximately 40% of Ontario, with a population of 551,691. In LHIN 13, 17% of the population is 65 years of age or older, which is significantly higher than the provincial average of 14%. LHIN 13 is diverse with 24% of the population [[Francophone]] and 10% of the population [[First Nations]] (North East LHIN, 2009). The estimated area of LHIN 14 is 470,000 square kilometers or approximately 47% of Ontario, with a population of  234,599. In LHIN 14, 14.3% of the population is 65 years of age or older. LHIN 14 is diverse with  3.5% of the population Francophone and 19.8% First Nations (North West LHIN, 2009).

==Scope of the health problem==

According to the [[World Health Organization]], chronic diseases are defined as diseases of long duration which generally show slow progression (WHO, 2012a). Examples of chronic diseases are [[cardiovascular disease]], [[respiratory disease]], [[stroke]], [[cancer]], and [[diabetes]]. The main risk factors associated with chronic diseases are tobacco and alcohol use, physical inactivity and unhealthy diets (WHO, 2011). Almost 80% of Ontarians over the age of 45 have a chronic condition, and treatment for these diseases amount to 55% of Ontario's total health costs (MOHLTC, 2007). In Northern Ontario the rates of chronic diseases are higher than the average provincial rates (MOHLTC, 2011).

==Current environment surrounding the problem==

In rural and Northern Ontario, [[life expectancy]] is less than the provincial average; [[disability]] rates are higher in smaller communities; rates for accidents, poisoning and violence are also higher in smaller communities; and people living in remote northern communities are the least healthy and have the lowest life and disability-free life expectancies (North East LHIN, 2009; North West LHIN, 2009). On average, Northern communities have a higher [[infant mortality]] rate than Southern communities, reflecting a lower overall health status (MOHLTC, 2011; Appendix B). The Northern Ontario population suffers from higher rates of a number of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes (North East LHIN, 2009; North West LHIN, 2009). There is a higher proportion of the population that are [[overweight]] or [[obese]] and a higher proportion of the population that are heavy drinkers and smokers (North East LHIN, 2009; North West LHIN, 2009).

==Interactions and dynamics related to the problem==

Analysis of the burden of chronic disease has pointed to the importance of [[risk factor]]s, such as being overweight, smoking, alcohol, and poor diet. These are indeed potent causes of chronic disease, however considering the causes of chronic disease entails a richer understanding of the determinants of health. There is a need to examine the causes of the causes: the social conditions that give rise to high risk behaviours of chronic diseases. A social determinants lens is crucial when addressing chronic diseases in Northern Ontario (Marmot, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://freecnaclasses.net/| title=CNA Training Classes }} Friday, 13 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The determinants of health (listed in Appendix A) are defined as the diverse set of factors that affect health and pertain to the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age (WHO, 2012b). The [[Canadian Institute for Advanced Research]] estimates that 75% of the health of the population is determined by factors outside of the health care system (Mackie, 2012). The determinants of health (DOH) contribute to and exacerbate the worse health outcomes in the LHIN 13 and 14 population. For example, in Northern Ontario, there are higher rates of unemployment and  lower rates of education compared to the rest of Ontario (North East LHIN, 2009; North West LHIN, 2009). Low education and unemployment, which are DOH in themselves, are also obvious risk factors for poverty, which is a very significant DOH. This exemplifies the complexity of the problem, as the DOH can interact and have [[synergistic]] effects. Furthermore, problems in access to health services in Northern Ontario quite often stem from distance and shortages of health human resources (Romanow, 2002). On average there is less than one physician per 1,000 people in rural areas, compared to two or more physicians per 1,000 people in larger urban centres (ICES, 2006).

Demographic and other factors aggravate this population health problem. Northern Ontario has 106 of the 134 [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] communities in Ontario (MNDM, 2011). The health status of Aboriginal people is overall worse than other Ontarians on most measures, including life expectancy, infant mortality, cardiovascular disease prevalence, diabetes prevalence and [[suicide]]s ([[Health Council of Canada]], 2005). Aboriginal populations also lag behind in almost all DOH (Health Council of Canada, 2005). For example, social support networks are limited for many Aboriginal people due to the residential school act and its legacy. Many Aboriginal people have been unable to establish effective relationships with families and friends as a result of being taken away at an early age from their communities. The usual social bonds that occur with family members, friends and community members were severely and permanently damaged, leaving this population particularly vulnerable (Health Council of Canada, 2005).

==Existing public policies and corporate strategies==

There are numerous policies and strategies that have been implemented to address chronic disease prevention and management in Northern Ontario. The existing policies and strategies range from cardiovascular disease prevention programs (for example Heart Health Ontario) to diabetes education programs (for example the Northern Diabetes Health Network) (MOHLTC, 2011). Although it is good that chronic disease prevention and management is not being neglected in Northern Ontario, there is some concern about the effectiveness and efficiency of all these different initiatives. The [[Centre for Rural and Northern Health Research]] reported that although health care organizations and relevant [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s were progressing towards implementing chronic disease management strategies, there was limited integration of programs at the community and regional levels. It was reported that there was a lack of communication impacting the coordination of services, to the extent that organizations were operating within separate [[Information silo|silos]], resulting in a lack of collaboration between the various organizations. There appears to be a similar situation in the North East LHIN (Minore, Hill &amp; Perry, 2009).

==Assessment of options for chronic disease prevention and management==

Prevention and management of chronic disease requires a comprehensive set of initiatives. Below will outline a number of options, using the applicable determinants of health as a framework, that can help make a difference in addressing chronic disease in Northern Ontario (LHINs 13 and 14).

;Personal Health Practices and Coping Skills
:Personal Health Practices and coping skills refer to those actions by which individuals can prevent diseases and promote self-care. These skills are very important in the prevention and management of chronic disease (PHAC, 2003).
;Patient Self-Management
:The North West LHIN's Community Care Access Centre is training patients in self-management using [[Stanford University]]'s six-week "Healthy Change with Chronic Conditions" workshop. Through this workshop, 75 to 100 people in LHIN 14 have been trained as master trainers. The trainers have a condition requiring management and have volunteered to support and teach others in their community with the same condition. At the end of the training, patients have gained a greater understanding of their condition and could successfully manage their condition at home. Researchers from Stanford University, through the evaluation of a randomized control trial, showed that participants experienced improved health behaviors and health status(Lorig, Sobel, Ritter, Laurent, &amp; Hobbs, 2001).
;Tele-services
:Through telecommunications, a range of tele-services are available to help patients and their families manage chronic conditions. Here are three such services:

:i) Telehomecare
:[[Telehomecare]] involves an electronic 2-way communication between the patient and the care provider, generally a nurse. The communication is usually in the form of audio/video conferencing, using the Internet. In addition to conferencing, medical monitoring equipment can be installed in the patient's home, and readings transmitted electronically to the care provider. Patient satisfaction is high with this type of intervention (Finkelstein, Speedie, &amp; Pottfoff,  2006).

:ii) Telehomecare Support For Informal Caregivers
:Informal caregiving is unpaid caregiving that is usually provided by relatives, friends or neighbours. Often the informal caregivers suffer from physical, emotional and financial stress, isolation, [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and a perceived lack of support (Hogenbirk, Libroiron-Grenier, Pong &amp; Young, 2005). Several telehealth interventions have been designed to reach out to informal caregivers and reduce their levels of stress, by providing counseling via videophone or providing platforms where caregivers can meet each other online and take part in skills development programs (Buckwalter, David, Wakefield, Kienzle, &amp; Murray, 2002).

:iii) Televisitation
:The Televisitation Program at [[Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre]] facilitates patient and family member communication through a face-to-face, real-time secure video connection during the patient's hospital stay. Televisitation reduces feelings of isolation on the part of the patient, aids in recovery, and prepares the patient's family for caregiving upon discharge (Petersen, 2011). As a result, caregiving is better for the patient and less stressful for the caregivers (K. Shields, personal communication, March 15, 2012).

;Social Support Networks
:Support from families, friends and communities is associated with better health and enables people to deal with adversity. These social support networks are significant determinants in effectively managing health problems such as chronic disease (PHAC, 2003).
;Family-Directed Respite Care
:[[Respite care]] is care that provides a primary, often informal, caregiver temporary relief from caring for an ill individual. In the North West LHIN, the vast distances makes hiring agency respite care very expensive. In 2009, a pilot project using an innovative model of respite care was developed in the District of Thunder Bay in cooperation with the Wesway agency, that maximizes choice, flexibility, cultural sensitivity, family empowerment and cost-effectiveness. The family receives money from the agency, manages the funds, and decides who will provide respite services and for how long. Families were very satisfied with the program. Based on the successful results, the project was extended to 2011 (North West LHIN, 2010).
;Culture and Social Environments
:In LHINs 13 and 14, approximately 30% of the population is First Nations. Culture is a significant determinant of health in the Aboriginal population in Northern Ontario. Aboriginals face additional health risks due to their socio-economic environment, which is largely determined by dominant cultural values that contribute to the perpetuation of conditions such as [[marginalization]], [[stigmatization]], loss or devaluation of language and culture and lack of access to culturally appropriate health care and services (PHAC, 2003). Elders play an important role is the Aboriginal community and can contribute to improved health outcomes with chronic disease management in a variety of ways. Working with and empowering Aboriginal leaders to promote health and well-being is a culturally sensitive option to address chronic disease prevention and management (Northern Ontario Medical Journal, 2011).
;Physical Environments
:In the built environment, factors related to housing, indoor air quality, and the design of communities can significantly influence chronic disease management. Aboriginal people are more likely to live in over-crowded dwellings compared to the rest of Ontarians and about 30.6% of Aboriginal households are in need of major repairs compared to 8.2% for Ontario (Health Council of Canada, 2005). Reducing harmful impacts from the built environment is a complex undertaking and would have to be done in targeted measurable steps to prove feasible. Smoking cessation programs to reduce the exposure to second-hand smoke in the home and community would be an example of a manageable and [[cost-effective]] intervention to better prevent chronic disease in this population.
;Health Services
:Health services, particularly those designed to maintain and promote health, to prevent disease, and to restore health and function contribute to population health (PHAC, 2003). Health human resources are an integral part of health services and play a fundamental role in providing care (PHAC, 2003).

:Northern Ontario School of Medicine
:The [[Northern Ontario School of Medicine]] (NOSM) is a joint initiative of [[Laurentian University]], [[Lakehead University]] and the [[Government of Ontario]]. It focuses on medical education that addresses the unique needs of rural and Northern Ontario so graduates are prepared to work in these areas (NOSM, 2012). Observational studies showed that health professionals from rural and Northern backgrounds are more likely to return to work in rural and Northern communities. Quasi-randomized trials demonstrated that clinical rotations in an underserviced setting increased medical students' likelihood to subsequently work in an underserviced area (WHO, 2009).

:Nurse Practitioners
:In Ontario, [[Nurse Practitioner]]s (NPs) are registered nurses with additional education and experience. According to recent statistics, there were approximately 800 primary health care NPs working in Ontario in 2007 (Government of Ontario, 2009). A 1999 Ontario study estimated that NPs are capable of handling 82.6% of patient care, with the remainder requiring physician referral (CNA, 2002). Various research studies and analyses demonstrate that costs for care provided by NPs or NP/physician teams are considerably less than care provided by physicians within office visits or by physician-only teams (Health Canada, 2006).

:Physician Assistants
:In Canada, [[physician assistant]]s support physicians in a range of health care settings and work under the direction of a licensed physician to provide patient care. Since 2007, Ontario's Physician Assistant (PA) initiative has been introducing PAs to a number of different health care settings through a series of demonstration projects across the province. Evidence shows that PAs help to improve access to health services and overall quality of care (Government of Ontario, 2010). A systematic review spanning 30 years and examining the use of the physician assistant model of care provision was undertaken by O'Connor and Hooker (2007). The review found that the quality of care was similar to care provided by a physician. Hospitals that had PAs on staff  "found that they could substitute about 50-75% of a doctor's work with one PA" (O'Connor and Hooker, 2007, p. 348).

'''Clinical trials publication''' is having research published in a [[peer review]]ed journal following [[clinical trial]]s.  Most investigators will want to have such a publication but the nature of clinical trials may create special considerations and obstacles.

Most agreements for a clinical trial between sponsor and investigator grants that the [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] may control publication of results by requesting publication delays, deleting portions of a manuscript, or placing limits on the types of issues that can be discussed. These controls serve to prevent disclosure of information that would compromise the sponsor's ability to [[patent]] inventions; to prevent disclosure of confidential information shared with investigator; and to coordinate the disclosure of results when a clinical trial is being conducted at multiple sites. These are legitimate business concerns, but may not restrict the investigator from freely publishing research results in the end of the study and approval process.

Due to repeated accusations and findings that some clinical trials conducted or funded by [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] may report only positive results for the preferred medication, the industry has been looked at [[Clinical trial#Commercial ties and unfavorable studies|much more closely]] by independent groups and government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=14970094&amp;dopt=Abstract|title=Association between industry funding and statistically significant pro-industry findings in medical and surgical randomized trials|publisher=|vauthors=Bhandari M, Busse JW, Jackowski D, Montori VM, Schunemann H, Sprague S, Mears D, Schemitsch EH, Heels-Ansdell D, Devereaux PJ|date=2004-02-17|accessdate=2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues and responses have included guidelines to limit financial inducements to researchers,&lt;ref name="moynihanbmj"&gt;Moynihan R ([[2003-05- cvc31]]).

'''Counseling psychology''' is a [[Psychology|psychological]] specialty that encompasses [[Psychological research|research]] and applied work in several broad domains: counseling process and outcome; supervision and training; career development and counseling; and prevention and health. Some unifying themes among counseling psychologists include a focus on assets and strengths, person–environment interactions, educational and career development, brief interactions, and a focus on intact personalities.&lt;ref&gt;Gelso, C.J., Williams, E.N. &amp; Fretz, B. (2014). ''Counseling Psychology'' (3rd ed.). Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "counselling" is of American origin, coined by Rogers, who, lacking a medical qualification was prevented from calling his work psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;Woolfe, Ray, et al. “Counselling Psychology in Context.” Handbook of Counselling Psychology, 2nd ed., Sage Publications, 2003, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., counselling psychology, like many modern psychology specialties, started as a result of [[World War II]]. During the war, the U.S. military had a strong need for vocational placement and training. In the 1940s and 1950s, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] created a specialty called "counseling psychology", and Division 17&lt;ref&gt;http://www.div17.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (now known as the Society for Counseling Psychology) of the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] was formed. The Society of Counseling Psychology unites psychologists, students and professionals who are dedicated to promote education and training, practice, scientific investigation, diversity and public interest in the field of professional psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Heppner, P., Leong, F.T.L., &amp; Chiao, H. (2008). A growing internationalization of counseling psychology. In: Brown, S.D. &amp; Lent, R.W. ''Handbook of Counseling Psychology'' (4th ed). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; This fostered interest in counselor training, and the creation of the first few counseling psychology PhD programs. The first counseling psychology PhD programs were at the [[University of Minnesota]]; [[Ohio State University]]; [[University of Maryland, College Park]]; [[University of Missouri]]; [[Teachers College, Columbia University]]; and [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/counspsy.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fadul, Jose A. . Encyclopedia of Theory &amp; Practice in Psychotherapy &amp; Counseling. Lulu Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades, counseling psychology as a profession has expanded and is now represented in numerous countries around the world. Books describing the present international state of the field include the ''Handbook of Counseling and Psychotherapy in an International Context'';&lt;ref name="MoodleyGielenWu2013"&gt;Moodley, Gielen, &amp; Wu (2013). ''Handbook of Counseling and Psychotherapy in an International Context''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''International Handbook of Cross-Cultural Counseling'';&lt;ref&gt;Gerstein, Heppner, Ægisdóttir, Leung, &amp; Norsworthy (2009). ''International Handbook of Cross-Cultural Counseling: Cultural Assumptions and Practices Worldwide''. Los Angeles: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Counseling Around the World: An International Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;Hohenshil, Amundson, &amp; Niles (2013). ''Counseling Around the World: An International Handbook''. Alexandria, VA : American Counseling Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together these volumes trace the global history of the field, explore divergent philosophical assumptions, counseling theories, processes, and trends in different countries, and review a variety of global counselor education programs. Moreover, traditional and indigenous treatment and healing methods that may predate modern counseling methods by hundreds of years remain of significance in many non-Western and Western countries.&lt;ref name="MoodleyGielenWu2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gielen, Fish, &amp; Draguns (2004). ''Handbook of Culture, Therapy, and Healing''. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gielen, U. P., Draguns, J. G., Fish, J. (Eds.). (2008). ''Principles of multicultural counseling and therapy.'' New York: Routledge, pp. x-xviii, 1-464.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment and salary==
Counseling psychologists are employed in a variety of settings depending on the services they provide and the client populations they serve. Some are employed in colleges and universities as teachers, supervisors, researchers, and service providers. Others are employed in independent practice providing counseling, [[psychotherapy]], assessment, and consultation services to individuals, [[relationship counseling|couples/families]], groups, and organizations. Additional settings in which counseling psychologists practice include [[Community mental health service|community mental health]] centers, [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] medical centers and other facilities, family services, health maintenance organizations, rehabilitation agencies, business and industrial organizations and consulting within firms.

The amount of training required for psychologists differs based on the country in which they are practicing. Typically, a psychologist completes an Undergraduate Degree followed by 5-6 years of further study and/or training, leading to the Ph.D. While both psychologists and psychiatrists offer counselling, psychiatrists must possess a medical degree and thus are able to prescribe medication where psychologists are not.

In 2017, the median salary for counseling psychologists in the United States was US$88,395.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indeed.com/salaries/Clinical-Psychologist-Salaries|title=Clinical Psychologist Salaries in the United States|website=www.indeed.com|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process and outcome==
Counseling psychologists are interested in answering a variety of research questions about counseling process and outcome. Counseling ''process'' refers to how or why counseling happens and progresses. Counseling ''outcome'' addresses whether or not counseling is effective, under what conditions it is effective, and what outcomes are considered effective—such as symptom reduction, behavior change, or quality of life improvement. Topics commonly explored in the study of counseling process and outcome include therapist variables, client variables, the counseling or [[therapeutic relationship]], cultural variables, process and outcome measurement, mechanisms of change, and process and outcome research methods. Classic approaches appeared early in the US in the field of humanistic psychology by Carl Rogers who identified the mission of counseling interview as "to permit deeper expression that the client would ordinarily allow himself"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Carl R.|title=Some Observations on the Organization of Personality|journal=American Psychologist|date=1947|volume=2|page=358|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Rogers/personality.htm|doi=10.1037/h0060883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Therapist variables===
Therapist variables include characteristics of a counselor or psychotherapist, as well as therapist technique, behavior, theoretical orientation and training. In terms of therapist behavior, technique and theoretical orientation, research on adherence to therapy models has found that adherence to a particular model of therapy can be helpful, detrimental, or neutral in terms of impact on outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Imel, Z.E. &amp; Wampold, B.E. (2008). The importance of treatment and the science of common factors in psychotherapy. In: Brown, S.D. &amp; Lent, R.W. ''Handbook of Counseling Psychology'' (4th ed). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent [[meta-analysis]] of research on training and experience suggests that experience level is only slightly related to accuracy in clinical judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Spengler, P.M., White, M.J., Aegisdottir, S., Maugherman, A.S., Anderson, L.A., Cook, R.S., Nichols, C.N., Lampropoulos, G.K., Walker, B.S., Cohen, G.R., &amp; Rush, J.D. (2009). The Meta-Analysis of Clinical Judgment Project: Effects of Experience in Judgment Accuracy. ''The Counseling Psychologist'' 37: 350–399&lt;/ref&gt; Higher therapist experience has been found to be related to less [[anxiety]], but also less focus.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, E.N., Hayes, J.A., &amp; Fauth, J. (2008). Therapist self-awareness: interdisciplinary connections and future directions. In: Brown, S.D. &amp; Lent, R.W. ''Handbook of Counseling Psychology'' (4th ed) (pp. 267–283). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that there is still work to be done in terms of training clinicians and measuring successful training.

===Client variables===
Client characteristics such as help-seeking attitudes and [[Attachment theory|attachment]] style have been found to be related to client use of counseling, as well as expectations and outcome. Stigma against [[mental illness]] can keep people from acknowledging problems and seeking help. Public stigma has been found to be related to self-stigma, attitudes towards counseling, and willingness to seek help.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, D.L., Wade, N.G., &amp; Hackler, A.H. (2007). Perceived public stigma and the willingness to seek counseling: the mediating roles of self-stigma and attitudes towards counseling. ''Journal of Counseling Psychology'', 54, 40–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of attachment style, clients with avoidance styles have been found to perceive greater risks and fewer benefits to counseling, and are less likely to seek professional help, than securely attached clients. Those with anxious attachment styles perceive greater benefits as well as risks to counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, P.A., Vogel, D.L., &amp; Wei, M. (2006).

===Counseling relationship===
{{Main|Therapeutic relationship}}
The relationship between a counselor and client is the feelings and attitudes that a client and therapist have towards one another, and the manner in which those feelings and attitudes are expressed.&lt;ref&gt;Gelso, C.J. &amp; Samstag, L.W. (2008). A tripartite model of the therapeutic relationship. In: Brown, S.D. &amp; Lent, R.W. ''Handbook of Counseling Psychology'' (4th ed.) (pp. 267–283). NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Some theorists have suggested that the relationship may be thought of in three parts: [[transference]] and [[countertransference]], working alliance, and the real—or personal—relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Gelso, C.J. and Hayes, J.A. (1998). ''The Psychotherapy Relationship: Theory, Research and Practice'' (pp. 22–46). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists argue that the concepts of transference and countertransference are outdated and inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Menaker, E. (1991). Questioning the sacred cow of the transference. In: Curtis, R.C. &amp; Stricker, G. ''How People Change: Inside and Outside Therapy'' (pp. 13–20). New York: Plenum Press. {{DOI|10.1007/978-1-4899-0741-7_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schachter, J. (2002). ''Transference: Shibboleth Or Albatross?'' Hillsdale, NJ: Analytic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacal, H. &amp; Carlton, L. (2011). ''The Power of Specificity in Psychotherapy: When Therapy Works—And When It Doesn't'' (pp. 81, 101–105). Lanham, MD: Jason Aronson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Transference can be described as the client's distorted perceptions of the therapist. This can have a great effect on the therapeutic relationship. For instance, the therapist may have a facial feature that reminds the client of their parent. Because of this association, if the client has significant negative or positive feelings toward their parent, they may project these feelings onto the therapist. This can affect the therapeutic relationship in a few ways. For example, if the client has a very strong bond with their parent, they may see the therapist as a father or mother figure and have a strong connection with the therapist. This can be problematic because as a therapist, it is not ethical to have a more than "professional" relationship with a client. It can also be a good thing, because the client may open up greatly to the therapist. In another way, if the client has a very negative relationship with their parent, the client may feel negative feelings toward the therapist. This can then affect the therapeutic relationship as well. For example, the client may have trouble opening up to the therapist because he or she lacks trust in their parent (projecting these feelings of distrust onto the therapist).&lt;ref&gt;Levy, K. N. &amp; Scala, J. (2012). Transference, transference interpretations, and transference-focused psychotherapies. ''Psychotherapy'', 49(3), 391–403. {{DOI|10.1037/a0029371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory about the function of the counseling relationship is known as the secure-base hypothesis, which is related to [[attachment theory]]. This hypothesis proposes that the counselor acts as a secure base from which clients can explore and then check in with. Secure attachment to one's counselor and secure attachment in general have been found to be related to client exploration. Insecure attachment styles have been found to be related to less session depth than securely attached clients.&lt;ref&gt;Romano, V., Fitzpatrick, M., &amp; Janzen, J. (2008). The secure-base hypothesis: global attachment, attachment to counselor, and session exploration in psychotherapy. ''Journal of Counseling Psychology'', 55(4), 495–504.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural variables===
Counseling psychologists are interested in how culture relates to help-seeking and counseling process and outcome. Standard surveys exploring the nature of counselling across cultures and various ethnic groups include Counseling Across Cultures by Paul B. Pedersen, Juris G. Draguns, Walter J. Lonner and Joseph E. Trimble,&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, P. B., Draguns, J. G., Lonner, W. J., &amp; Trimble, J. E. (Eds.). (2008). ''Counseling across cultures'' (6th ed). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Handbook of Multicultural Counseling by [[Joseph G. Ponterotto]], J. Manueal Casas, Lisa A. Suzuki and Charlene M. Alexander&lt;ref&gt;Ponterotto, J. G., Casas, J. M., Suzuki, L. A., &amp; Alexander, C. M. (Eds.). (2010). ''Handbook of multicultural counseling'' (3rd ed). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; and Handbook of Culture, Therapy, and Healing by Uwe P. Gielen, Jefferson M. Fish and Juris G. Draguns.&lt;ref&gt;Gielen, U. P., Fish, J. M., &amp; Draguns, J. G. (Eds.). (2004). ''Handbook of culture, therapy, and healing''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet E. Helms]]' racial identity model can be useful for understanding how the relationship and counseling process might be affected by the client's and counselor's racial identity.&lt;ref&gt;Helms, J.E. (1995). An update on Helms' White and people of color racial identity models. In: J.G. Ponterotto, J.M. Casas, L.A. Suzuki, &amp; G.M. Alexander (Eds.), ''Handbook of Multicultural Counseling'' (pp. 181–198). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests that clients who are Black are at risk for experiencing racial micro-aggression from counselors who are White.&lt;ref&gt;Constantine, M. (2007). Racial micro-aggression against African American clients in cross-racial counseling relationships. ''Journal of Counseling Psychology'', 54(1), 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Efficacy for working with clients who are lesbians, gay men, or bisexual might be related to therapist demographics, gender, sexual identity development, sexual orientation, and professional experience.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, F., Worthington, R., Soth-McNett, A., &amp; Schwartz, S. (2008). Gender and sexual identity-based predictors of lesbian, gay, and bisexual affirmative counseling self-efficacy. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice'', 39(3), 353–360.&lt;/ref&gt; Clients who have multiple oppressed identities might be especially at-risk for experiencing unhelpful situations with counselors, so counselors might need help with gaining expertise for working with clients who are transgender, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender people of color, and other oppressed populations.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, T., Gorcheva, R., Walther, W., Sulzner, J., &amp; Cohen, J. (2008). Therapists' helpful and unhelpful situations with LGBT clients: An exploratory study. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice'', 39(3), 361–368.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender role socialization can also present issues for clients and counselors. Implications for practice include being aware of [[stereotype]]s and biases about male and female identity, roles and behavior such as emotional expression.&lt;ref&gt;Nutt, R.L. &amp; Brooks, G.R. (2008). Psychology of gender. In: Brown, S.D. &amp; Lent, R.W. ''Handbook of Counseling Psychology'' (4th ed) (pp. 267–283). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; The APA guidelines for multicultural competence outline expectations for taking culture into account in practice and research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apa.org/pi/multiculturalguidelines/homepage.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counseling ethics===
{{More footnotes|section|date=July 2015}}

Perceptions on ethical behaviors vary depending upon geographical location, but ethical mandates are similar throughout the global community. Ethical standards are created to help practitioners, clients and the community avoid any possible harm or potential for harm. The standard ethical behaviors are centered on "doing no harm" and preventing harm.

Counselors cannot share any confidential information that is obtained through the counseling process without specific written consent by the client or legal guardian except to prevent clear, imminent danger to the client or others, or when required to do so by a court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/mental-health/|title=Sharing Information Related to Mental Health|last=(OCR)|first=Office for Civil Rights|date=2014-02-20|work=HHS.gov|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insurance companies or government programs will also be notified of certain information about your diagnosis and treatment to determine if your care is covered. Those companies and government programs are bound by [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] to keep that information strictly confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/confidentiality.aspx|title=Protecting your privacy: Understanding confidentiality|website=www.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counselors are held to a higher standard that most professionals because of the intimacy of their therapeutic delivery. Counselors are not only to avoid fraternizing with their clients. They should avoid dual relationships, and never engage in sexual relationships.

Counselors are to avoid receiving gifts, favors, or trade for therapy. In some communities, it may be avoidable given the economic standing of that community. In cases of children, children and the mentally handicapped, they may feel personally rejected if an offering is something such as a "cookie". As counselors, a judgement call must be made, but in a majority of cases, avoiding gifts, favors, and trade can be maintained.

The [[National Board for Certified Counselors]] states that counselors "shall discuss important considerations to avoid exploitation before entering into a non-counseling relationship with a former client. Important considerations to be discussed include amount of time since counseling service termination, duration of counseling, nature and circumstances of client's counseling, the likelihood that the client will want to resume counseling at some time in the future; circumstances of service termination and possible negative effects or outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcc.org/assets/ethics/nbcc-codeofethics.pdf|title=NATIONAL BOARD FOR CERTIFIED COUNSELORS (NBCC) CODE OF ETHICS|last=National Board of Certified Counselors|first=|date=June 8, 2012|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621074754/http://www.nbcc.org/assets/ethics/nbcc%2Dcodeofethics.pdf|archive-date=2011-06-21|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outcome measurement===
Counseling outcome measures might look at a general overview of symptoms, symptoms of specific disorders, or positive outcomes, such as subjective well-being or quality of life. The Outcome Questionnaire-45 is a 45-item self-report measure of psychological distress.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, M.J., Gregerson, A.T., &amp; Burlingame, G.M. (2004). The Outcome Questionnaire-45. In M. Maruish (Ed.). ''Use of Psychological Testing for Treatment Planning and Outcomes Assessment'' (3rd ed) (pp. 191–234). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of disorder-specific measure is the [[Beck Depression Inventory]]. The Quality of Life Inventory is a 17-item self-report [[life satisfaction]] measure.&lt;ref&gt;Frisch, M., Cornell, J., Villanueva, M., &amp; Retzlaff, P. (1992). Clinical validation of the Quality of Life Inventory. A measure of life satisfaction for use in treatment planning and outcome assessment. ''Psychological Assessment'', 4(1), 92–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process and outcome research methods===
Research about the counseling process and outcome uses a variety of research methodologies to answer questions about if, how, and why counseling works. Quantitative methods include randomly controlled clinical trials, correlation studies over the course of counseling, or laboratory studies about specific counseling process and outcome variables. [[Qualitative research]] methods can involve conducting, transcribing and coding interviews; transcribing and/or coding therapy sessions; or fine-grain analysis of single counseling sessions or counseling cases.

==Training and supervision==

===Professional training process===
Counseling psychologists are trained in graduate programs. Almost all programs grant a PhD, but a few grant a [[Master of Counselling|MCouns]], [[Master of Education|MEd]], [[Master of Arts|MA]], [[Doctor of psychology|PsyD]] or [[Doctor of education|EdD]]. Most doctoral programs take 5–6 years to complete. Graduate work in counseling psychology includes coursework in general psychology and [[statistics]], counseling practice, and research.&lt;ref&gt;Norcross, J., Sayette, M., &amp; Mayne, T. (2008) ''Insider's Guide to Graduate Programs in Clinical and Counseling Psychology''. Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Students must complete an original [[dissertation]] at the end of their graduate training. Students must also complete a one-year full-time internship at an accredited site before earning their doctorate. In order to be licensed to practice, counseling psychologists must gain clinical experience under supervision, and pass a standardized exam.

====Australia====
{{Contradict|date=June 2018|about=education requirements}}

In Australia, counseling psychology programs are accredited by the [[Australian Psychological Society|Australia Psychological Society]] (APS). To become licensed as a counseling psychologist, one must meet the criteria for a psychologist's licence: 3 years studying bachelor's degree in Psychology, 4th year Honours degree or Postgraduate Diploma in Psychology, and two-year full-time supervised practice plus 80 hours of professional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychology.org.au/studentHQ/studying/study-pathways/|title=Australian Psychological Society : Study pathways|website=www.psychology.org.au|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To become a counseling psychologist one must complete a two-year master's degree after obtaining a four-year degree in psychology. There are other avenues available, such as a two year supervised training program after Honours (i.e. 4+2 pathway), or one year of postgraduate coursework and practical placements followed by a one year supervised training program (i.e. 5+1 pathway).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findmypathway.com/psychology/psychology-internships/|title=Psychology Internship Pathways - Find My Pathway|last=|first=|date=|website=Find My Pathway|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) for further options: http://www.psychologycouncil.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt; A substantial component of this master's degree is dedicated to individual psychotherapy, family and couples therapy, group therapy, developmental theory and psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Australian Psychological Society: Counselling psychology |url=http://www.psychology.org.au/public/counselling/ |website=www.psychology.org.au |accessdate=2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training models and research===
Counseling psychology includes the study and practice of counselor training and counselor supervision. As researchers, counseling psychologists may investigate what makes training and supervision effective. As practitioners, counseling psychologists may supervise and train a variety of clinicians. Counselor training tends to occur in formal classes and training programs. Part of counselor training may involve counseling clients under the supervision of a licensed clinician. Supervision can also occur between licensed clinicians, as a way to improve clinicians' quality of work and competence with various types of counseling clients.

As the field of counseling psychology formed in the mid-20th century, initial training models included Robert Carkuff's human relations training model,&lt;ref&gt;Carkuff, R. (1969). ''Helping and Human Relations''. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Kagan's Interpersonal Process Recall,&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, N., Krathwohl, D., and Farquhar, W. (1965). ''IPR—Interpersonal Process Recall''. East Lansing, MI: Michigan State University.&lt;/ref&gt; and Allen Ivey's microcounseling skills.&lt;ref&gt;Ivey, A. (1971). ''Microcounseling: Innovations in Interviewing Training''. Springfield, IL: Thomas.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern training models include [[Gerard Egan]]'s skilled helper model,&lt;ref&gt;Egan, G. (2010). ''The Skilled Helper'' (9th ed.). Belmont, CA: Brooks Cole, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; and Clara E. Hill's three-stage model (exploration, insight, and action).&lt;ref&gt;Hill, C.E. (2014). ''Helping Skills'' (4th ed.). Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent analysis of studies on counselor training found that modeling, instruction, and feedback are common to most training models, and seem to have medium to large effects on trainees.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, C.E. &amp; Lent, R. (2006). A narrative and meta-analytic review of helping skills training: time to revive a dormant area of inquiry. ''Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training'', 43(2), 154–172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supervision models and research===
Like the models of how clients and therapists interact, there are also models of the interactions between therapists and their supervisors. Edward S. Bordin proposed a model of supervision working alliance similar to his model of [[therapeutic relationship|therapeutic working alliance]]. The Integrated Development Model considers the level of a client's motivation/anxiety, autonomy, and self and other awareness. The Systems Approach to Supervision views the relationship between supervisor and supervised as most important, in addition to characteristics of the supervisor's personal characteristics, counseling clients, training setting, as well as the tasks and functions of supervision. The Critical Events in Supervision model focuses on important moments that occur between the supervisor and supervised.&lt;ref name="LadanyInman2008"&gt;Ladany, N. &amp; Inman, A. (2008) Developments in counseling skills training and supervision. In: Brown, S.D. &amp; Lent, R.W. ''Handbook of Counseling Psychology'' (4th ed.). John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems can arise in supervision and training. First, supervisors are liable for [[malpractice]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} Also, questions have arisen as far as a supervisor's need for formal training to be a competent supervisor.&lt;ref name="Westefeld09"&gt;Westefeld, J.S. (2009). Supervision of psychotherapy: models, issues, and recommendations. ''The Counseling Psychologist'', 37, 296–316.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests that conflicting, multiple relationships can occur between supervisors and clients, such as that of the client, instructor, and clinical supervisor.&lt;ref name="Westefeld09"/&gt; The occurrence of racial micro-aggression against Black clients&lt;ref&gt;Constantine, M. &amp; Sue, D. (2007). Perceptions of racial micro-aggression among black clients in cross-racial studies. ''Journal of Counseling Psychology'', 54(2), 142–153.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests potential problems with racial bias in supervision. In general, conflicts between a counselor and his or her own supervisor can arise when supervisors demonstrate disrespect, lack of support, and blaming.&lt;ref name="LadanyInman2008"/&gt;

==Vocational development and career counseling==

===Vocational theories===
There are several types of theories of vocational choice and development. These types include trait and factor theories, social cognitive theories, and developmental theories. Two examples of trait and factor theories, also known as person–environment fit, are Holland's theory and the Theory of Work Adjustment.

[[John L. Holland|John Holland]] hypothesized six vocational personality/interest types and six work environment types: realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional. When a person's vocational interests match his or her work environment types, this is considered congruence. Congruence has been found to predict occupation and college major.&lt;ref name="Betz2008"&gt;Betz, N. (2008). Advances in vocational theories. In: Brown, S.D. &amp; Lent, R.W. ''Handbook of Counseling Psychology'' (4th ed). New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theory of Work Adjustment (TWA), as developed by [[René V. Dawis|René Dawis]] and Lloyd Lofquist,&lt;ref&gt;Dawis, R. V. &amp; Lofquist, L.H. (1984). ''A Psychological Theory of Work Adjustment: An Individual-Differences Model and its Applications''. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesizes that the correspondence between a worker's needs and the reinforced systems predicts job satisfaction, and that the correspondence between a worker's skills and a job's skill requirements predicts job satisfaction. Job satisfaction and personal satisfaction together should determine how long one remains at a job. When there is a discrepancy between a worker's needs or skills and the job's needs or skills, then change needs to occur either in the worker or the job environment.

Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) has been proposed by Robert D. Lent, Steven D. Brown and Gail Hackett. The theory takes [[Albert Bandura]]'s work on self-efficacy and expands it to interest development, choice making, and performance. Person variables in SCCT include self-efficacy beliefs, outcome expectations and personal goals. The model also includes demographics, ability, values, and environment. Efficacy and outcome expectations are theorized to interrelate and influence interest development, which in turn influences choice of goals, and then actions. Environmental supports and barriers also affect goals and actions. Actions lead to performance and choice stability over time.&lt;ref name="Betz2008"/&gt;

[[Career development]] theories propose vocational models that include changes throughout the lifespan. Donald Super's model proposes a lifelong five-stage career development process. The stages are growth, exploration, establishment, maintenance, and disengagement. Throughout life, people have many roles that may differ in terms of importance and meaning. Super also theorized that career development is an implementation of self-concept. Gottfredson also proposed a cognitive career decision-making process that develops through the lifespan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The initial stage of career development is hypothesized to be the development of self-image in childhood, as the range of possible roles narrows using criteria such as sex-type, social class, and prestige. During and after [[adolescence]], people take abstract concepts into consideration, such as interests.

===Career counseling===
Career counseling may include provision of occupational information, modeling skills, written exercises, and exploration of career goals and plans.&lt;ref&gt;Whiston, S.C. &amp; Rahardja, D. (2008). Vocational counseling process and outcome. In: Brown, S.D. &amp; Lent, R.W. ''Handbook of Counseling Psychology'' (4th ed). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Career counseling can also involve the use of personality or career interest assessments, such as the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]], which is based on [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of psychological type, or the [[Strong Interest Inventory]], which makes use of Holland's theory. Assessments of skills, abilities, and values are also commonly assessed in career counseling.

==Professional journals==
In the [[United States]], the premier [[scholarly journal]]s of the profession are the ''[[Journal of Counseling Psychology]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apa.org/journals/cou/&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Counseling Psychologist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://tcp.sagepub.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, counseling psychology articles are published in the counseling psychology section of the ''Australian Psychologist''.

In [[Europe]], the scholarly journals of the profession include the ''European Journal of Counselling Psychology'' (under the auspices of the European Association of Counselling Psychology)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eacp.eu/Journal.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Counselling Psychology Review'' (under the auspices of the [[British Psychological Society]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bps.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; ''Counselling Psychology Quarterly'' is an international interdisciplinary publication of [[Routledge]] (part of the Taylor &amp; Francis Group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/09515070.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015055451/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/09515070.asp |archivedate=2010-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
'''Dhanvantari''' is the [[Hindu]] god of medicine and an avatar of Lord Vishnu. He appears in the ''[[Puranas]]'' as the god of [[Ayurveda]]. Though he is one of the [[Yaksha|Yakshas]], who brought nectar of immortality from [[Samudra manthan|Samudramanthan]]. It is common practice in Hinduism for worshipers to pray to Dhanvantari seeking his blessings for sound health for themselves and/or others, especially on [[Dhanteras]] or Dhanwantari Trayodashi. The Indian Government has declared that Dhanwantari Trayodashii Kumara every year would be celebrated as "National Ayurveda Day"&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/Dhanteras-to-be-observed-as-National-Ayurveda-Day/articleshow/54599037.cms|title=Dhanteras to be observed as National Ayurveda Day - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Textual sources ==
"Ramayana Balakand"{{cn|date=September 2017}} and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' state that Dhanvantari emerged from the [[Ocean of Milk]] and appeared with the pot of [[amrita]] (elixer for immortality) during the story of the ''[[Samudra manthan|Samudra (or) Sagara Mathana]]'' whilst the ocean was being churned by the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s and [[Asura]]s, using the [[Mount Mandara|Mandara]] mountain and the serpent [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]]. The pot of Amrita was snatched by the Asuras, and after this event another avatar, [[Mohini]], appears and takes the nectar back from the Asuras. It is also believed that Dhanvantari promulgated the practise of Ayurveda.&lt;ref name=M107&gt;[[#Madhavan|Madhavan 2007]], p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;Of special mention here is the treatise of ''Dhanvantari-Nighantu'', which completely elucidates Dhanvantari's medicinal plants.&lt;ref&gt;Dhanvantari-Nighantu [https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/studies-on-medicinal-planets-and-drugs-in-dhanvantari-nighantu-two-volumes-NAD479/][http://www.saujanyabooks.com/details.aspx?id=34040][https://www.scribd.com/doc/290274952/dhanvantari-nighantu-pdf][http://www.vaidyaraj-ayurveda.com/dhanvantari.html][https://docslide.us/documents/dhanvantari-nighantupdf.html][https://www.amazon.in/Dhanvantari-Nighantu-Sanskrit-Text-English-Translation/dp/8189469126]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
According to the ancient [[Sanskrit]] work ''Vishnudharamottara'', Dhanvantari is a handsome individual and should usually be depicted with four hands, with one of them carrying Amrita, the ambrosia of the gods. Dhanvantari is depicted as Vishnu with four hands, holding [[Shankha]], [[Chakra]], Jalauka (leech) and a pot containing rejuvenating nectar called ''[[amrita]]''. He is often shown with a leech in his hand rather than the scriptures.&lt;ref name=M107/&gt;

== Birthday celebration ==
His birthday is celebrated by the practitioners of Ayurveda every year, on [[Dhanteras]], two days before [[Diwali]], the Hindu festival of lights. It is also celebrated as National Ayurveda Day in India.&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"/&gt; The National Ayurveda Day celebrations started since 2016.

[[File:Statue of Dhanvantari.jpg|thumb|Statue of Dhanvantari at Taxakeshwar temple]]

== Temples in India ==

There are a few dedicated temples to Dhanvantari in South India especially in [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]], where ayurveda is highly practised and patronised. The Dhanvatari temple in Thottuva in Kerala is a particularly famous temple, where Lord Dhanvantari's idol is almost six feet tall and facing east. On the right hand the lord holds Amrith and with the left hand the lord holds Atta, Shanku and Chakra. The 'Ekadasi' day celebration, which falls on the same day as the 'Guruvayur Ekadasi' is of special significance.

In [[Tamil Nadu]], in the courtyard of [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangam)]], there is a Dhanvantari shrine where daily worship of the deity is performed. In front of this temple there is an engraved stone believed to be from the 12th century. According to the writings on the stone, Garuda Vahana Bhattar, a great ayurvedic physician, established the statue inside the temple. A ''[[prasada]]'' or ''[[theertham]]'', a herbal [[decoction]], is given to the visitors. The shrine is the oldest Dhanvantari shrine in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Madhavan|Madhavan 2007]], p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Another Dhanvantari shrine is found in the second precinct of [[Varadharaja Perumal Temple, Kanchipuram|Varadaraja Perumal Temple]] in [[Kanchipuram]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Madhavan|Madhavan 2007]], p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

In Varanaseya Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya, [[Varanasi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] state, one statue of Dhanvantari is present in the University museum. Two statues are at the headquarters of the [[Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha]] at [[New Delhi]]. There is another statue inside the Ayurveda Maha Sammelan office, Dhanawantari Bhawan at New Delhi and one statue of Dhanvantari is present at Mohyal Ashram in Haridwar.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

One black-stoned statue facing south is also located in a personal property of a Brahman family in Chowk area, Varanasi. It is said that the Idol was found beneath the premises of that property when it was being constructed. When the Brahman owner was unable to identify the god represented, he decided to set it adrift in the Ganges the following morning. However, the same night, the god appeared in his dream, introduced himself as KashiRaja Devodas (Dhanvantari), and commanded that the statue should be left where it was found. Hence, in his house he built this temple, which is largely unknown in that area. Of them all, this temple could be believed by the god's devotees to be the most divine and spiritual, because of the idol's serendipitous discovery, the reason for its rescue from oblivion, and its preservation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12036">Some states in the [[United States of America]] have enacted or proposed legislation requiring drug testing of people applying for welfare. As of early 2017, 15 US states had passed legislation enabling drug testing of welfare applicants or recipients, primarily in relation to [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]] payments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/drug-testing-and-public-assistance.aspx|title=Drug Testing for Welfare Recipients and Public Assistance|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug testing of welfare recipients has been proposed but not implemented in Canada and the UK&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wincup|first=Emma|date=2014|title=Thoroughfares, crossroads and cul-de-sacs: drug testing of welfare recipients|url=|journal=The International Journal on Drug Policy|volume=25|issue=5|pages=1031–1037|doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2014.02.011|issn=1873-4758|pmid=24709412|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and a trial program is being considered in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/BudgetReview201718/WelfareRecipients|title=Drug testing for welfare recipients|last=7111;|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand, recipients of some payments may be required to take a drug test if this is a requirement of a potential employer or trainer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Proponents of such programs have supported them with a variety of goals in mind, including: getting help for drug users on welfare payments by referring those testing positive to treatment, avoiding "subsidizing drug habits" with public money,&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/06/stateline-drug-testing-welfare-states/6118111/|title=Some states still pushing drug testing for welfare|author=Grovum, Jake|date=6 March 2014|work=USA Today|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; deterring drug use, reducing state welfare spending, and protecting children.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Mary Jean|last2=Franklin|first2=James|date=2018-10-25|title=An Argument Against Drug Testing Welfare Recipients|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/707066|journal=Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=309–340|doi=10.1353/ken.2018.0019|pmid=30369508|issn=1086-3249}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jeffrey|first=Widelitz|date=2011|title=Florida's Suspicionless Drug Testing of Welfare Applicants|url=https://nsuworks.nova.edu/nlr/vol36/iss1/10/|journal=Nova Law Review|language=en|volume=36|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive drug test result rates==
In a pilot drug testing  program in Florida in 1999-2000, 5.1% returned a positive urinalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crew|first=Robert E.|last2=Davis|first2=Belinda Creel|date=2003|title=Assessing the effects of substance abuse among applicants for TANF benefits: the outcome of a demonstration project in Florida|journal=Journal of Health &amp; Social Policy|volume=17|issue=1|pages=39–53|doi=10.1300/J045v17n01_03|issn=0897-7186|pmid=14620735}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study by [[ThinkProgress]] found that out of seven states reporting data on welfare drug testing, only one had a usage rate above 1%.&lt;ref name="thinkpro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/02/26/3624447/tanf-drug-testing-states/|title=What 7 States Discovered After Spending More Than $1 Million Drug Testing Welfare Recipients|first1=Bryce|last1=Covert|first2=Josh|last2=Israel|publisher=ThinkProgress|date=2015-02-26|accessdate=2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of data on US state programs provided by CLASP shows that of the total population screened in 9 states, 0.19% returned positive tests, or 0.57% if refused tests (where reported) are treated as positives (see data in appendix D).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

An '''enema''' is the injection of fluid into the [[Large intestine|lower bowel]] by way of the [[rectum]].&lt;ref name=Cullingworth_introduction&gt;Cullingworth, ''A Manual of Nursing, Medical and Surgical'':155&lt;/ref&gt; 

In standard medicine, the most frequent uses of enemas are to relieve constipation and for bowel cleansing before a medical examination or procedure;&lt;ref name= Biology_Online_Dictionary&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Soapsuds_enema |title = Soapsuds enema |website = Biology-Online Dictionary |publisher = Biology-Online |accessdate = 6 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also, they are employed as a [[lower gastrointestinal series]] (also called a barium enema),&lt;ref name=NIH_barium&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003817.htm |title = Barium enema |website = MedlinePlus |publisher = U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services – National Institutes of Health (NIH) |accessdate = 6 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to check diarrhea, as a vehicle for the administration of food, water or medicine, as a stimulant to the general system, as a local application and, more rarely, as a means of reducing temperature,&lt;ref name=Cullingworth_introduction /&gt; as treatment for [[encopresis]], and as a form of [[rehydration therapy]] ([[proctoclysis]]) in patients for whom [[intravenous therapy]] is not applicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S0885-3924(97)00367-9 |last1 = Bruera |first1 = E |last2 = Pruvost |first2 = M |last3 = Schoeller |first3 = T |last4 = Montegjo |first4 = G |last5 = Watanabe |first5 = S |date = April 1998 |title = Proctoclysis for Hydration of Terminally Ill Cancer Patients |journal = Jour Pain Symptom Management |volume = 15 |issue = 4 |pages = 216–9 |pmid=9601155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other contexts, enemas are used by some alternative health therapies, used recreationally, chiefly as part of sexual activities, but also in sadomasochism, as well as simply for pleasure, used to intoxicate with alcohol, used to administer drugs for both recreational and religious reasons, and used for punishment.

== Medical usage ==
{{Columns-list}}

The principal medical usages of enemas are:

=== Bowel cleansing ===
[[File:Soapsuds Enemas.jpg|thumb|Soapsuds enemas, in a can with a nozzle typical for a cleansing enema, and in a contrast enema bag with a barium nozzle]]
[[File:Enema prepared, disposable.jpg|thumb|A prepared, disposable enema]]

==== Acute treatments ====
As [[bowel]] stimulants, enemas are employed for the same purposes as orally administered [[laxative]]s: To relieve [[constipation]]; To treat [[fecal impaction]]; To empty the colon prior to a medical procedure such as a [[colonoscopy]]. A large volume or high enema&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/high%20enema|title=high enema |website=Medical Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be given to cleanse as much of the colon as possible of feces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intranet.tdmu.edu.ua/data/kafedra/internal/meds/prac_skills_alg/Care%20of%20patients/Administering%20an%20Enema.htm |title=Administering an Enema |website=Care of patients |date=14 July 2015 |publisher=Ternopil State Medical University |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peoi.org/Courses/Coursesen/nursepractice/ch/ch12e1.html |title=Types of Enemas |website=Fundamentals of Nursing Practice |publisher=Professional Education, Testing and Certification Organization International |author= Rhodora Cruz |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a low enema is generally useful only for stool in the rectum, not in the intestinal tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/low%20enema|title=low enema |website=Medical Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such enemas' mechanism consists of the volume of the liquid causing rapid expansion of the intestinal tract in conjunction with, in the case of certain solutions, irritation of the intestinal [[mucosa]], resulting in powerful [[peristalsis]] and a feeling of extreme fecal urgency. The enema is retained until there is a uncontrollable urge to defecate, at which time the recipient may expel any [[feces|fecal matter]] loosened by the instilled solution together with the solution itself. The procedure may cause uncomfortable bloating and cramping.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===== Water-based solutions =====

Plain water can be used, simply functioning mechanically to expand the colon, thus prompting evacuation.

[[Castile soap]] is commonly added because its irritation of the colon's lining increases the urgency to defecate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0897189704000801|title=Safety and effectiveness of large-volume enema solutions |author= MarileeSchmelzer, Lawrence R.Schiller, Richard Meyer, Susan M.Rugari, PattiCase|date=November 2004 |journal=Applied Nursing Research |accessdate=July 22, 2017 |doi=10.1016/j.apnr.2004.09.010 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=265–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[buffer solution|Buffered]] [[sodium phosphates#Use|sodium phosphate]] solution draws additional water from the bloodstream into the colon to increase the effectiveness of the enema, but can be rather irritating to the colon, causing intense cramping or "griping."

[[saline (medicine)#Normal|Normal saline]] is least irritating to the colon, at the opposite end of the spectrum. Like plain water, it simply functions mechanically to expand the colon, but having a neutral concentration gradient, it neither draws [[electrolyte]]s from the body, as happens with plain water, nor draws water into the colon, as occurs with phosphates. Thus, a salt water solution can be used when a longer period of retention is desired, such as to soften an impaction.

Likewise, [[baking soda|baking]] [[baking soda|soda]] (sodium bicarbonate) can be dissolved in the water.&lt;ref name=therapeutic-aspects-of-hydrotherapy&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ijpsr.com/bft-article/a-review-on-therapeutic-aspects-of-hydrotherapy/?view=fulltext|title=A REVIEW ON THERAPEUTIC ASPECTS OF HYDROTHERAPY|last=Chaurasia|first=Gita |last2=Patil |first2=Amruta |last3=Dighe |first3=Shweta |date=2015|website=International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious |reason=Only referenced in non medical contexts; the one reference here IS from a legitimate medical source, BUT its subject is an alternative medicine matter|date=September 2018}}

==== Chronic treatments ====
===== Transanal irrigation =====

Its effectiveness varies considerably, some individuals experiencing complete control of incontinence but others reporting little or no benefit.&lt;ref name=Emmanuel2013 /&gt;

The term ''retrograde irrigation'' distinguishes this procedure from the [[Malone antegrade continence enema]], where irrigation fluid is introduced into the colon proximal to the anus via a surgically created irrigation port.

===== Bowel management =====
{{Main|Bowel management}}
Patients who have a bowel disability, a medical condition which impairs control of [[defecation]], e.g., fecal incontinence or constipation,&lt;ref name="Bowel management definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bowel Management After Spinal Cord Injury|url=http://www.sci-info-pages.com/bowel.html|website=www.sci-info-pages.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; can use bowel management techniques to choose a predictable time and place to evacuate.&lt;ref name="Bowel management definition"/&gt; Without bowel management, such persons might either suffer from the feeling of not getting relief, or they might soil themselves.&lt;ref name="Bowel management definition"/&gt;

While simple techniques might include a controlled [[Healthy diet|diet]] and establishing a toilet routine,&lt;ref name="Bowel management definition"/&gt; a daily enema can be taken to empty the colon, thus preventing unwanted and uncontrolled bowel movements that day.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Peña A, Guardino K, Tovilla JM, Levitt MA, Rodriguez G, Torres R Bowel management for fecal incontinence in patients with anorectal malformations Pediatr.

=== Contrast (X-ray) ===

[[File:Barium Contrast Enema.jpg|thumb|A barium enema in a disposable bag manufactured for that purpose]]

In a [[lower gastrointestinal series]] an enema that may contain [[Barium sulphate#Radiocontrast agent|barium sulfate]] powder or a water-soluble contrast agent is used in the [[Röntgen ray|radiological]] imaging of the bowel.  Called a ''barium enema'', such enemas are sometimes the only practical way to ''view'' the colon in a relatively safe manner.&lt;ref name=NIH_barium /&gt; Following barium enema administration, patients often find that flushing the remaining barium with additional water, baking soda, or saline enemas helps restore normal colon activity without complications of constipation from the administration of the barium sulfate.

=== Medication administration ===

The administration of substances into the bloodstream.  This may be done in situations where it is undesirable or impossible to deliver a medication by mouth, such as [[antiemetic]]s given to reduce [[nausea]] (though not many antiemetics are delivered by enema). Additionally, several anti-angiogenic agents, which work better without digestion, can be safely administered via a gentle enema.

The topical administration of medications into the rectum, such as [[corticosteroids]] and [[mesalazine]] used in the treatment of [[inflammatory bowel disease]].  Administration by enema avoids having the medication pass through the entire [[gastrointestinal tract]], therefore simplifying the delivery of the medication to the affected area and limiting the amount that is absorbed into the bloodstream.

Rectal corticosteroid enemas are sometimes used to treat mild or moderate ulcerative colitis. They also may be used along with systemic (oral or injection) corticosteroids or other medicines to treat severe disease or mild to moderate disease that has spread too far to be treated effectively by medicine inserted into the rectum alone.

== Adverse effects ==

Improper administration of an enema can cause electrolyte imbalance (with repeated enemas) or ruptures to the bowel or rectal tissues resulting in internal [[bleeding]]. However, these occurrences are rare in healthy, [[sobriety|sober]] adults. Internal bleeding or rupture may leave the individual exposed to infections from intestinal bacteria. Blood resulting from tears in the colon may not always be visible, but can be distinguished if the feces are unusually dark or have a red hue. If intestinal rupture is suspected, medical assistance should be obtained immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Encyclopedia of Nursing and Allied Health |first = ME |last = Martelli |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gGENH/is_/ai_2699003276.htm |accessdate = 11 January 2008 |format = &amp;nbsp;– &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AMartelli+intitle%3AEncyclopedia+of+Nursing+and+Allied+Health&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |publisher = [[FindArticles]] |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080123073414/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gGENH/is_/ai_2699003276.htm |archivedate = 23 January 2008 |deadurl = yes |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enema tube and solution may stimulate the [[vagus nerve]], which may trigger an [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] such as [[bradycardia]]. Enemas should not be used if there is an undiagnosed [[abdominal pain]] since the peristalsis of the bowel can cause an inflamed [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] to [[Appendicitis|rupture]].

There are arguments both for and against colonic irrigation in people with [[diverticulitis]], [[ulcerative colitis]], [[Crohn's disease]], severe or internal [[hemorrhoids]] or [[tumors]] in the rectum or [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], and its usage is not recommended soon after bowel [[surgery]] (unless directed by one's [[health care provider]]). Regular treatments should be avoided by people with [[heart disease]] or [[renal failure]].

== History ==

[[File:Clyster syringes.jpg|thumb|A normal clyster syringe ''(front)'' and the nozzle for a syringe designed for self-administration ''(rear)''. The latter avoided the need for a second party to attend an embarrassing procedure.]]

''Enema'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἔνεμα (''énema''), from ἐνίημι (''eníēmi''), "(I) inject".

''Clyster'' (/ˈklɪstə(r)/), also spelled ''glister'' in the 17th century, rarely "cloister" or "clister" comes from Greek κλυστήρ (''klystḗr''), from κλύζω (''klýzo''), "(I) wash". It is an archaic word for enema, more particularly for enemas administered using a ''clyster syringe''&amp;nbsp;– that is, a [[syringe]] with a rectal nozzle and a plunger rather than a bulb. Clyster syringes were used from the 17th century (or before) to the 19th century, when they were largely replaced by enema bulb syringes, bocks, and bags.

The first mention of the enema in medical literature is in the Ancient Egyptian [[Ebers Papyrus]] ({{circa|1550}} BCE). One of the many types of medical specialists was an Iri, the Shepherd of the Anus. Many medications were administered by enemas.&lt;ref&gt;Magner, ''A History of Medicine'':31&lt;/ref&gt; There was a Keeper of the Royal Rectum who may have primarily been the pharaoh's enema maker. The god [[Thoth]], according to Egyptian mythology, invented the enema.&lt;ref&gt;Magner, ''A History of Medicine'':26&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Olmec]] from their middle preclassic period (10th through 7th centeries BCE) through the Spanish Conquest used trance-inducing substances ceremonially, and these were ingested via, among other routes, enemas administered using jars.

The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] in their late classic age (7th through 10th centuries CE) used enemas for, at least, ritual purposes, in the Xibalban court of the God D whose worship included ritual cult paraphernalia. It is hypothesized that these enemas were for ritual purification and the ingestion of intoxicants and hallucinogens. The Maya illustrated the use of a characteristic enema bulb syringe by female attendants administering clysters ritually.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons and Carlson:92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3528674"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = de Smet PA, Hellmuth NM |title = A multidisciplinary approach to ritual enema scenes on ancient Maya pottery |journal = J Ethnopharmacol |volume = 16 |issue = 2–3 |pages = 213–62 |year = 1986 |pmid = 3528674 |doi = 10.1016/0378-8741(86)90091-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Afrikanische Holzplastik.jpg|thumb|Pressure enema from an animal bladder (African wooden sculpture, 19th century)]]

In the first century BC the [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek physician]] [[Asclepiades of Bithynia]] wrote "Treatment consists merely of three elements: drink, food, and the enema".&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough, ''The Drug Lore of ASCLEPIADES of Bithynia'':44&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he contended that indigestion is caused by particles of food that are too big and his prescribed treatment was proper amounts of food and wine followed by an enema which would remove the improper food doing the damage.&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough, ''The Drug Lore of ASCLEPIADES of Bithynia'':46&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second century CE the Greek philosopher [[Celsus]] recommended an enema of pearl barley in milk or rose oil with butter as a nutrient for those suffering from dysentery and unable to eat&lt;ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rpharms.com/museum-pdfs/21-enemas.pdf |title = Information Sheet:21 Enemas |website = Information Sheets |publisher = Museum of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, London |accessdate = 26 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Galen mentions enemas in several contexts.&lt;ref name=Galen&gt;{{Citation |last = Mattern |first = Susan P. |year = 2008 |title = Galen and the Rhetoric of Healing |publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |location = Johns Hopkins University Press, Maryland, USA |isbn=978-0-8018-8835-9 |pages = 31, 145, 149 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5IXlOC1_liEC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval times appear the first illustrations of enema equipment, a clyster syringe consisting of a tube attached to a pump action bulb made of a pig bladder and the 15th century Simple piston syringe clysters came into use. Beginning in the 17th century enema apperatus was chiefly designed for self-administration at home and many were French as enemas enjoyed wide usage in France.&lt;ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical /&gt;

When clyster syringes were in use in Europe, the patient was placed in an appropriate position (kneeling, with the buttocks raised, or lying on the side); a servant or [[apothecary]] would then insert the nozzle into the anus and press the plunger, resulting in the liquid remedy (generally, [[water]], but also some other preparations) being injected into the colon.

[[File:Klistierbank1.JPG|thumb|Portable enema self-administration apparatus by [[Giovanni Alessandro Brambilla]] (18th century; Medical History Museum, University of Zurich)]]

Because of the embarrassment a woman might feel when showing her buttocks (and possibly her genitals, depending on the position) to a male apothecary, some contraptions were invented that blocked all from the apothecary's view except for the anal area. Another invention was syringes equipped with a special bent nozzle, which enabled self-administration, thereby eliminating the embarrassment.

Clysters were administered for symptoms of constipation and, with more questionable effectiveness, stomach aches and other illnesses.  In his early-modern treatise, ''The Diseases of Women with Child,'' [[François Mauriceau]] records that both midwives and man-midwives commonly administered clysters to labouring mothers just prior to their delivery.

In the 16th century, satirists made physicians a favorite target, resembling Molière's caricature whose prescription for anything was "clyster, bleed, purge," or "purge, bleed, clyster."&lt;ref&gt;Magner, ''A History of Medicine'':218&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Thomas More]]'s eldest daughter had fallen sick of the sweating sickness and could not be awakened by doctors. More prayed for her recovery, and then

&lt;blockquote&gt;where incontinent came into his mind, that a glister should be the only way to help her, which when he had told the physicians, they by-and-by confessed, that if there were any hope of health, that it was the very best help indeed, much marvelling of themselves, that they had not afore remembered it.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:William Roper|Roper, William]], [[s:The Life of Sir Thomas More|''The Life of Sir Thomas More'']]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:A monkey rejects the old style clyster for his new 'clyso-pompe', which he fills with opium and marshmallow Wellcome V0011775.jpg|thumb|19th century satirical cartoon of a monkey rejecting an old style clyster for a new design, filled with marshmallow and opium]]

In the 18th century [[tobacco smoke enema]]s were used to resuscitate drowned people. Tobacco resuscitation kits consisting of a pair of bellows and a tube were provided by the Royal Humane Society of London and placed at various points along the Thames.&lt;ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical /&gt;

Clysters were a favourite medical treatment in the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[nobility]] of the [[Western world]] up to the 19th century. As medical knowledge was fairly limited at the time, purgative clysters were used for a wide variety of [[ailment]]s, the foremost of which were [[stomach ache]]s and constipation.

[[Molière]], in several of his plays, introduces characters of incompetent [[physician]]s and apothecaries fond of prescribing this remedy, also discussed by Argan, the [[hypochondriac]] patient of ''[[Le Malade Imaginaire]]''. More generally, clysters were a theme in the [[burlesque]] comedies of that time.

According to [[Claude de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon]], clysters were so popular at the court of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of [[France]] that the duchess of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] had her servant give her a clyster in front of the King (her [[modesty]] being preserved by an adequate posture) before going to the [[comedy]]. However, he also mentions the astonishment of the King and Mme de Maintenon that she should take it before them.

In the 19th century many new types of enema administration equipment were devised, including the bulb enema. Later there came to be a device to allow gravity to infuse the solution into the recipient, consisting of a rubber bag or bucket connected to a hose with a nozzle at the other end to insert into the patient's anus, the bag or bucket being held or hung above the patient. These continue to be used, although rubber has been replaced by modern materials and the bags, at least in hospital use, as disposable.&lt;ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical /&gt;

In the late 20th century the microenema was invented, this being a disposable squeeze bottle with contents that cause the body to draw water into the colon, e.g., sodium biphosphate (popular in the United States) or glycerin (popular in Japan).

[[Nutrient enema]]s were administered with the intent of providing [[nutrition]] when normal [[eating]] is not possible. Although this treatment is ancient, dating back at least to [[Galen]], and commonly used in the Middle Ages,&lt;ref name="pmid20766702"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Short AR, Bywaters HW |title = Amino-Acids and Sugars in Rectal Feeding |journal = Br Med J |volume = 1 |issue = 2739 |pages = 1361–7 |date = June 1913 |pmid = 20766702 |pmc = 2299894 |doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.2739.1361 |jstor = 25302025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and still a common technique in 19th century medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Mackenzie JW |title = The nutrient enema |journal = Arch.

Although well documented, the procedure of inserting [[coffee]] through the [[anus]] to cleanse the rectum and [[large intestines]] is considered by most medical authorities to be unproven, rash and potentially dangerous.&lt;ref name=Ernst&gt;{{cite journal |author = Ernst E |title = Colonic irrigation and the theory of autointoxication: a triumph of ignorance over science |journal = J.

In the [[Gerson therapy]], coffee enemas are administered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gerson.org/g_therapy/default.asp |title = The Gerson Institute&amp;nbsp;— Alternative Cancer Treatment |website =  |accessdate = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030401121651/http://gerson.org/g_therapy/default.asp |archive-date = 1 April 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of alternative medicine have claimed that coffee enemas have an anti-[[cancer]] effect by "detoxifying" metabolic products of tumors&lt;ref name=colitis&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Lee CJ, Song SK, Jeon JH, Sung MK, Cheung DY, Kim JI, Kim JK, Lee YS |title = Coffee enema induced acute colitis |journal = The Korean Journal of Gastroenterology = Taehan Sohwagi Hakhoe Chi |volume = 52 |issue = 4 |pages = 251–254 |year = 2008 |pmid = 19077527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no medical scientific evidence to support this.&lt;ref name="shils"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Shils ME, Hermann MG |title = Unproved dietary claims in the treatment of patients with cancer |journal = Bull N Y Acad Med |volume = 58 |issue = 3 |pages = 323–40 |date = April 1982 |pmid = 7052177 |pmc = 1805327 |doi =  |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Cassileth B |title = Gerson regimen |journal = Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.) |volume = 24 |issue = 2 |page = 201 |date = February 2010 |pmid = 20361473 |doi =  |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kellogg's enemas====

In the late 19th century Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg]] made sure that the bowel of each and every patient was plied with water, from above and below. His favorite device was an enema machine ("just like one I saw in Germany") that could run fifteen gallons of water through a person's bowel in a matter of seconds. Every water enema was followed by a pint of yogurt—half was eaten, the other half was administered by enema "thus planting the protective germs where they are most needed and may render most effective service." The yogurt served to replace "the intestinal flora" of the bowel, creating what Kellogg claimed was a completely clean intestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofquackery.com/amquacks/kellogg.htm |title=Dr. John Harvey Kellogg |author= |date= |website=Great American Quacks |publisher=Museum  of Quackery |accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recreational usage ===

Shown here in an optional harness.]]

==== Pleasure ====
{{Main|Klismaphilia}}
Enjoyment of enemas is known as [[klismaphilia]], which medically is classified as a [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/paraphilias.html Paraphilias]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from [http://www.psychologytoday.com Psychology Today]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Denko|first=JD.|date=April 1973|title=Klismaphilia: enema as a sexual preference. Report of two cases|journal=Am J Psychother|volume=27|pages=232–50 | issue=2|pmid=4704017|doi=10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.1973.27.2.232}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person with klismaphilia is a ''klismaphile''.

Klismaphiles can gain satisfaction of enemas through fantasies, by actually receiving or giving one, or through the process of eliminating steps to being administered one (e.g., under the pretense of being constipated).&lt;ref name="Denko"/&gt; An enema can be an auxiliary to, or even a substitute for, genital [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].&lt;ref name="Denko"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Agnew"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agnew|first=J.|date=October 1982|title=Klismaphilia--a physiological perspective|journal=American Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=36|pages=554–66|issn=0002-9564|pmid=7158678|issue=4|doi=10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.1982.36.4.554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denko"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Denko|first=JD.|date=April 1976|title=Amplification of the erotic enema deviance|journal=Am J Psychother|volume=30|pages=236–55 | issue=2|pmid=937588|doi=10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.1976.30.2.236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, enemas can stimulate the [[prostate]] gland.

That some women use enemas while masturbating was documented by [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, A.]] in "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female." H stated, :There still other masturbatory techniques which were regularly or occasionally employed by some 11 percent of the females in the sample ... enemas, and other anal insertions, ... were employed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Kinsey | first1 = Alfred Charles | title = Sexual Behavior in the Human Female | publisher = Indiana University Press | place = Bloomington, Indiana, U.S.A. | year = 1953 | isbn = 978-0-253-33411-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enemas are sometimes used in [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] activities&lt;ref&gt;Brame et al., ''Different loving &amp;ndash; The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission'':513,516&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agnew, ''Klismaphilia'':74,77,78,79&lt;/ref&gt; for [[erotic humiliation]]&lt;ref&gt;Brame et al., ''Different loving &amp;ndash; The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission'':515,516,520&lt;/ref&gt; or for physical discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;Brame et al., ''Different loving &amp;ndash; The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission'':513,517&lt;/ref&gt;
                                  
An enema can be employed prior to anal sexual activities such as [[anal sex]], [[anilingus]], and [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]] to enhance sensation or remove feces, possibly reducing risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;Agnew, ''Klismaphilia'':76&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Intoxication ====
{{Main|Alcohol enema}}
Noting that deaths have been reported from [[alcohol poisoning]] via enemas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin2007-13.html |title = The Enema Within |accessdate = 11 January 2008 |year = 2008 |publisher = [[Darwin Awards]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[alcohol enema]] can be used to very quickly instill alcohol into the bloodstream, absorbed through the membranes of the colon. However, great care must be taken as to the amount of alcohol used. Only a small amount is needed as the intestine absorbs the alcohol far more quickly than the stomach.

Preceding an enema for administration of drugs or alcohol, a cleansing enema may first be used for cleaning the colon to help increase the rate of absorption.&lt;ref name="pmid6126289"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = de Boer AG, Moolenaar F, de Leede LG, Breimer DD |title = Rectal drug administration: clinical pharmacokinetic considerations |journal = Clin Pharmacokinet |volume = 7 |issue = 4 |pages = 285–311 |year = 1982 |pmid = 6126289 |doi = 10.2165/00003088-198207040-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious rituals ===

Enemas have been used for ritual rectal drug administration such as [[balché]], [[alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[peyote]], and other [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drugs]] and [[entheogen]]s, most notably by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and also some other American [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] tribes. Some tribes continue the practice in the present day.&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-084550-3"&gt;{{cite book |author = Diamond, Jared M. |title = The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal (P.S.) |publisher = Harper Perennial |location = New York, N.Y |year = 1992 |page = 432 |isbn = 978-0-06-084550-6 |oclc =  |doi = }}; pp. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

Called [[Basti (Panchakarma)|Basti]] or Vasti in [[Ayurveda]], enemas are part of [[Panchakarma]] procedure in which [[Herbalism|herbal medicines]] are introduced rectally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chakrapaniayurveda.com/basti/ |title=Basti: Medicated Enema Therapy |author= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Punitive usage ===

Enemas have also been forcibly applied as a means of punishment. In the vastly influential Latin American text [[Facundo|''Facundo, or Civilization and Barbarism'']], for example, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] describes the use of [[Chili pepper|pepper]] and [[turpentine]] enemas by police forces as a way of discouraging political dissent in post-independence Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;"Ribbons and Rituals". In Problems in Modern Latin American History. Ed. Chasteen and Wood. Oxford, UK: Scholarly Resources, 2005. p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture]] documented instances of enemas being used by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in order to ensure "total control" over detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Rushe |first1 = Dominic |last2 = MacAskill |first2 = Ewen |last3 = Cobain |first3 = Ian |last4 = Yuhas |first4 = Alan |last5 = Laughland |first5 = Oliver |title = Rectal rehydration and waterboarding: the CIA torture report's grisliest findings |url = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-worst-findings-waterboard-rectal |accessdate = 13 March 2015 |agency = [[The Guardian]] |date = 9 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monument ===

A {{convert|365|kg|lb|abbr=off|adj=on}} brass statue of a syringe enema bulb held aloft by three angels stands in front of the "Mashuk" spa in the settlement of [[Zheleznovodsk]] in Russia. It is the only known monument to the enema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25265056/ns/world_news-weird_news/t/enema-monument-unveiled-russian-resort/#.UHCx06Vq2Dk |title = Enema monument unveiled in Russian resort |author =  |date = 19 June 2008 |website = msn.com |accessdate = 2 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''filter cake''' is formed by the [[Chemical substance|substance]]s that are retained on a [[filter (chemistry)|filter]]. The filter cake grows in the course of [[filtration]], becoming "thicker" as [[particulate matter]] is retained.

With increasing layer thickness, the [[flow resistance]] of the filter cake increases. After a time, the filter cake has to be removed from the filter, e.g. by backflushing. If this is not accomplished, the filtration is disrupted because the [[flow resistance|viscosity]] of the filter cake gets too high; hence, too little of the mixture to be filtered can pass through the filter cake and the filter plugs. The specifications of the filter cake dictate the filtration method of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhs-filtration.com/technical/Selection-of-Filtration.pdf|title=Technical Articles – BHS Filtration|website=www.bhs-filtration.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14577">A '''fitness trail''' or '''parcourse''' consists of a [[wikt:path|path]] or [[wikt:course|course]] with outdoor [[exercise equipment]] or [[obstacle]]s installed along its length for [[Exercise|exercising]] the human [[Human body|body]] to promote good [[health]].  The course is designed to promote [[physical fitness]] training in the style attributed to [[Georges Hébert]].  In general, fitness trails can be natural or man-made, located in areas such as forest, transportation rights-of-way, parks, or urban settings.  Equipment exists to provide specific forms of physiological exercise, and can consist of natural features including climbable rocks, trees, and river embankments, or manufactured products (stepping posts, chin-up and climbing bars) designed to provide similar physical challenges.  The [[degree of difficulty]] of a course is determined by terrain slope, trail surface (dirt, grass, gravel, etc.), obstacle height (walls) or length (crawls) and other features.  Urban parcourses tend to be flat, to permit participation by the elderly, and to accommodate cyclists, runners, skaters and walking. The new concept of an [[outdoor gym]], containing traditional gym equipment specifically designed for outdoor use, is also considered to be a development of the parcourse. These outdoor exercise gyms include moving parts and are often made from galvanised metal.

The original parcours was invented in 1968 by Swiss architect Erwin Weckemann with support from Swiss life insurance firm Vita. The first course was built in Zurich, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Formaldehyde''' ([[systematic name]] '''methanal''') is a naturally occurring [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (H-CHO). It is the simplest of the [[Aldehyde|aldehydes]] (R-CHO). The common name of this substance comes from its similarity and relation to [[formic acid]].

Formaldehyde is an important precursor to many other materials and chemical compounds. In 1996, the installed capacity for the production of formaldehyde was estimated at 8.7 million tons per year.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Günther Reuss, Walter Disteldorf, Armin Otto Gamer, Albrecht Hilt "Formaldehyde" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_619}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is mainly used in the production of industrial [[resin]]s, e.g., for [[particle board]] and [[coating]]s.

In view of its widespread use, toxicity, and volatility, formaldehyde poses a significant danger to human health.&lt;ref name="IARC"&gt;{{citation|contribution=Formaldehyde|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol88/mono88-6.pdf|pages=39–325|title=Formaldehyde, 2-Butoxyethanol and 1-''tert''-Butoxypropan-2-ol|series=IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans 88|publisher=[[International Agency for Research on Cancer]]|location=Lyon, France|year=2006|isbn=92-832-1288-6|format=PDF}} {{11thRoC|file=s089form|name=Formaldehyde (gas)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the US [[National Toxicology Program]] described formaldehyde as "[[#Safety|known to be a human carcinogen]]".&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Gardiner|title=Government Says 2 Common Materials Pose Risk of Cancer|date=10 June 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/health/11cancer.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="12Report2011"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Toxicology Program]]|title=12th Report on Carcinogens|date=10 June 2011|publisher=[[National Toxicology Program]]|url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/index.cfm?objectid=72016262-BDB7-CEBA-FA60E922B18C2540|accessdate=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roc2011"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Toxicology Program]]|title=Report On Carcinogens – Twelfth Edition – 2011|date=10 June 2011|url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/roc12.pdf|publisher=[[National Toxicology Program]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of formaldehyde==
Formaldehyde is more complicated than many simple carbon compounds in that it adopts several different forms. As a gas, formaldehyde is colorless and has a characteristic pungent, irritating odor.  Upon condensation, the gas converts to various other forms of formaldehyde (with different chemical formulas) that are of more practical value. One important derivative is the cyclic [[trimer (chemistry)|trimer]] metaformaldehyde or [[1,3,5-trioxane]] with the formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. There is also a linear polymer called [[paraformaldehyde]]. These compounds have similar chemical properties and are often used interchangeably.

[[File:Paraformaldehyd.svg|left|thumb|[[Paraformaldehyde]] is a common form of formaldehyde for industrial applications.]]

When dissolved in water, formaldehyde also forms a hydrate, [[methanediol]], with the formula {{nowrap|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This compound also exists in equilibrium with various [[oligomer]]s (short polymers), depending on the concentration and temperature. A saturated water solution, of about 40% formaldehyde by volume or 37% by mass, is called "100% '''formalin'''". A small amount of [[stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizer]], such as [[methanol]], is usually added to suppress [[oxidation]] and [[polymerization]]. A typical commercial grade formalin may contain 10–12% methanol in addition to various metallic impurities. The name was long ago [[generic trademark|genericized]] from an old trade name "Formalin".&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Processes in the upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] contribute up to 90% of the total formaldehyde in the environment. Formaldehyde is an intermediate in the oxidation (or [[combustion]]) of [[methane]], as well as of other carbon compounds, e.g. in [[forest fire]]s, [[automobile]] exhaust, and [[tobacco smoke]]. When produced in the atmosphere by the action of sunlight and [[oxygen]] on [[atmospheric methane]] and other [[hydrocarbon]]s, it becomes part of [[smog]]. Formaldehyde has also been detected in outer space (see below).

Formaldehyde and its [[adducts]] are ubiquitous in living organisms.  It is formed in the metabolism of endogenous amino acids{{which|date=January 2018}} and is found in the bloodstream of humans and other primates at concentrations of approximately 0.1 millimolar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/download.php?record_id=18948# |title=Review of the Formaldehyde Assessment in the National Toxicology Program 12th Report on Carcinogens |format= |work= |accessdate= |page= 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments in which animals are exposed to an atmosphere containing isotopically labeled formaldehyde have demonstrated that even in deliberately exposed animals, the majority of formaldehyde-DNA adducts found in non-respiratory tissues are derived from endogenously produced formaldehyde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/download.php?record_id=18948# |title=Review of the Formaldehyde Assessment in the National Toxicology Program 12th Report on Carcinogens |format= |work= |accessdate= | page = 95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formaldehyde does not accumulate in the environment, because it is broken down within a few hours by sunlight or by bacteria present in soil or water. Humans metabolize formaldehyde quickly, so it does not accumulate, converting it to [[formic acid]] in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Formaldehyde Is Biodegradable, Quickly Broken Down in the Air By Sunlight or By Bacteria in Soil or Water|url=https://www.americanchemistry.com/Media/PressReleasesTranscripts/ACC-news-releases/Formaldehyde-Is-Biodegradable.html|publisher=Formaldehyde Panel of the American Chemistry Council|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formaldehyde was the first [[polyatomic]] [[Organic chemistry|organic]] molecule detected in the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zuckerman|first1=B.|last2=Buhl|first2=D.|last3=Palmer|first3=P.|last4=Snyder|first4=L.

Formaldehyde appears to be a useful probe for astrochemists, due to its low reactivity in the gas phase and to the fact that the 1&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;←1&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; and 2&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;←2&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; K-doublet transitions are rather clear.

==Synthesis and industrial production==

===History===
Formaldehyde was first reported in 1859 by the Russian chemist [[Aleksandr Butlerov]] (1828–86)&lt;ref&gt;A. Butlerow (1859) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NYs8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ueber einige Derivate des Jodmethylens"] (On some derivatives of methylene iodide), ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', vol . 111, pages 242–252. In this paper, Butlerov discovered formaldehyde, which he called "Dioxymethylen" (methylene dioxide) [page 247] because his empirical formula for it was incorrect (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/ref&gt; and was conclusively identified in 1869 by [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]].&lt;ref&gt;In 1867, A. W. Hofmann first announced to the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences the production of formaldehyde by passing methanol vapor in air over hot platinum wire. See: A. W. Hofmann (14 October 1867) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vh4XAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA665#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Zur Kenntnis des Methylaldehyds"] ([Contributions] to our knowledge of methylaldehyde), ''Monatsbericht der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin'' (Monthly Report of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin), vol. 8, pages 665–669. Reprinted in:

However, it was not until 1869 that Hofmann determined the correct empirical formula of formaldehyde. See: A.W. Hofmann (5 April 1869) [https://books.google.com/books?id=58YAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA362#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Beiträge zur Kenntnis des Methylaldehyds"], ''Monatsbericht der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin'', vol. ?, pages 362–372.

===Industry===
Formaldehyde is produced industrially by the catalytic oxidation of [[methanol]]. The most common catalysts are [[silver]] metal or a mixture of an [[iron oxide|iron]] and [[molybdenum trioxide|molybdenum]] or [[vanadium pentoxide|vanadium]] [[oxide]]s. In the commonly used [[formox process]], methanol and oxygen react at ca.&amp;nbsp;250–400&amp;nbsp;°C in presence of iron oxide in combination with molybdenum and/or vanadium to produce formaldehyde according to the [[chemical equation]]:&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt;
:2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The silver-based catalyst usually operates at a higher temperature, about 650&amp;nbsp;°C. Two chemical reactions on it simultaneously produce formaldehyde: that shown above and the [[dehydrogenation]] reaction:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In principle, formaldehyde could be generated by oxidation of [[methane]], but this route is not industrially viable because the methanol is more easily oxidized than methane.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt;

==Organic chemistry==
Formaldehyde is a building block in the synthesis of many other compounds of specialised and industrial significance. It exhibits most of the chemical properties of other aldehydes but is more reactive. 

===Self-condensation and hydration===
Formaldehyde, unlike most aldehydes, oligomerizes spontaneously.  The trimer is trioxane and the polymer is called paraformaldehyde.  Many cyclic oligomers have been isolated.  Similarly, formaldehyde hydrates to give the geminal diol, which condenses further to form oligomers HO(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H.  Monomeric CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is rarely encountered.

===Oxidation===
It is more readily [[oxidation|oxidized]] by atmospheric oxygen into [[formic acid]].  For this reason, commercial formaldehyde typically is contaminated with formic acid.

===Hydroxymethylation and chloromethylation===
Formaldehyde is a good [[electrophile]]. With good nucleophiles such as thiols, amines, and even amides, no acid catalyst is required.  The resulting hydroxymethyl derivatives typically react further.  Thus amines give [[hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine]]s.  Similarly, when combined with [[hydrogen sulfide]], it forms [[trithiane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|last1=Bost|first1=R. W.|last2=Constable|first2=E. W.|title=''sym''-Trithiane|prep=cv2p0610|volume=16|pages=81|year=1936|collvol=2|collvolpages=610}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:3CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In the presence of acids, it participates in [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]] reactions with [[aromatic compound]]s resulting in hydroxymethylated derivatives:
:ArH  +  CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →   ArCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH
When conducted in the presence of hydrogen chloride, the product is the chloromethyl compound, as described in the [[Blanc chloromethylation]].  If the arene is electron-rich, as in phenols, elaborate condensations ensue.  With 4-substituted phenols one obtains [[calixarenes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|last1=Gutsche|first1=C. D.|last2=Iqbal|first2=M.|title=''p-tert''-Butylcalix&amp;#91;4&amp;#93;arene|prep=cv8p0075|year=1993|collvol=8|collvolpages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phenol results in polymers.

===Base reactions===

==Uses==

===Industrial applications===
Formaldehyde is a common precursor to more complex compounds and materials. In approximate order of decreasing consumption, products generated from formaldehyde include [[urea formaldehyde resin]], [[melamine resin]], [[phenol formaldehyde resin]], [[polyoxymethylene plastic]]s, [[1,4-butanediol]], and [[methylene diphenyl diisocyanate]].&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt; The [[textile industry]] uses formaldehyde-based resins as [[Finishing (textiles)|finishers]] to make fabrics crease-resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Formaldehyde in Clothing and Textiles FactSheet|url=http://www.nicnas.gov.au/chemical-information/information-sheets/existing-chemical-info-sheets/formaldehyde-in-clothing-and-textiles-factsheet|website=NICNAS|publisher=Australian National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme|accessdate=12 November 2014|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formaldehyde-based materials are key to the manufacture of automobiles, and used to make components for the transmission, electrical system, engine block, door panels, axles and brake shoes. The value of sales of formaldehyde and derivative products was over $145 billion in 2003, about 1.2% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States and Canada. Including indirect employment, over 4 million people work in the formaldehyde industry across approximately 11,900 plants in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.formaldehyde.org/economy/economic_importance/ Economic Importance], ''Formaldehyde Council''. 2009. Accessed on April 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UFresinSyn.svg|thumb|340px|left|Two steps in formation of urea-formaldehyde resin, which is widely used in the production of particle board.]]

When treated with phenol, urea, or melamine, formaldehyde produces, respectively, hard thermoset phenol formaldehyde resin, urea formaldehyde resin, and melamine resin.  These polymers are common permanent adhesives used in [[plywood]] and [[carpet]]ing. It is used as the [[wet strength|wet-strength]] resin added to sanitary paper products such as (listed in increasing concentrations injected into the paper machine headstock chest) facial tissue, table napkins, and roll towels. They are also foamed to make [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], or [[casting|cast]] into moulded products. Production of formaldehyde resins accounts for more than half of formaldehyde consumption.

Formaldehyde is also a precursor to polyfunctional [[alcohol]]s such as [[pentaerythritol]], which is used to make [[paint]]s and [[explosive]]s. Other formaldehyde derivatives include [[methylene diphenyl diisocyanate]], an important component in [[polyurethane]] paints and foams, and [[hexamine]], which is used in phenol-formaldehyde resins as well as the explosive [[RDX]]. 

Condensation with acetaldehyde affords [[pentaerythritol]], a chemical necessary in synthesizing [[PETN]], a high explosive.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|first=H. B. J.|last=Schurink|title=Pentaerythritol|prep=cv1p0425|volume=4|pages=53|year= 1925|collvol=1|collvolpages=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Condensation with phenols gives [[phenol-formaldehyde resin]]s. 

===Niche uses===
====Disinfectant and biocide====
An aqueous solution of formaldehyde can be useful as a disinfectant as it kills most [[bacteria]] and fungi (including their spores). It is used to produce killed vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Aquarists use formaldehyde as a treatment for the parasites ''[[Ichthyophthirius multifiliis]]'' and ''[[Cryptocaryon irritans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ruth |last=Francis-Floyd |title=Use of Formalin to Control Fish Parasites |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/vm061 |publisher=Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida |date=April 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527111132/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/vm061 |archivedate=May 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formaldehyde is also approved for use in the manufacture of animal feeds in the US.  It is an antimicrobial agent used to maintain complete animal feeds or feed ingredients Salmonella negative for up to 21 days.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Publishing Office |title=§573.460   Formaldehyde |url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=373e2ce8edf3f674e80eb9270a461c7d&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se21.6.573_1460&amp;rgn=div8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tissue fixative and embalming agent====
[[File:Steve O'Shea injecting formalin.jpg|thumb|Injecting a [[giant squid]] specimen with formalin for preservation.]]
Formaldehyde preserves or [[Fixation (histology)|fixes]] tissue or cells. The process involves cross-linking of primary [[amino group]]s. The European Union has banned the use of formaldehyde due to its carcinogenic properties as a [[biocide]] (including embalming) under the [[Biocidal Products Directive]] (98/8/EC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31998L0008:EN:HTML Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market]. ''OJEU'' L123, 24.04.1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–63.

Despite reports to the contrary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alkesh|last=Patel|url=http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=41468|title=Formaldehyde Ban set for 22 September 2007|publisher=WebWire|date=2007-07-04|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; no decision on the inclusion of formaldehyde on Annex&amp;nbsp;I of the Biocidal Products Directive for product-type&amp;nbsp;22 (embalming and taxidermist fluids) had been made {{As of|2009|9|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ |title=European chemical Substances Information System (ESIS) entry for formaldehyde |accessdate=2009-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101220543/http://esis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formaldehyde-based crosslinking is exploited in [[ChIP-on-chip]] or [[ChIP-sequencing]] genomics experiments, where DNA-binding proteins are cross-linked to their cognate binding sites on the chromosome and analyzed to determine what genes are regulated by the proteins. Formaldehyde is also used as a denaturing agent in [[RNA]] gel [[electrophoresis]], preventing RNA from forming secondary structures. A solution of 4% formaldehyde fixes pathology tissue specimens at about one mm per hour at room temperature.

====Drug testing====
Formaldehyde and a 18&amp;nbsp;[[Concentration#Molality|M]] (concentrated) [[sulfuric acid]] makes [[Marquis reagent]]—which can identify [[alkaloid]]s and other compounds.

====Photography====
In photography, formaldehyde is used in low concentrations for [[C-41 process|process C-41]] (color negative film) stabilizer in the final wash step,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kodak.com/global/en/service/Zmanuals/z131.shtml|title=Process C-41 Using Kodak Flexicolor Chemicals – Publication Z-131|publisher=Kodak|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the [[E-6 process|process E-6]] pre-bleach step, to make it unnecessary in the final wash.

Formaldehyde [[Topical medication|topical]] can be used as an antiperspirant to treat [[Hyperhidrosis|hyperhydrosis]].

==Safety==
The safety of formaldehyde is very complicated.  It occurs naturally and is "an essential intermediate in cellular metabolism in mammals and humans."&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; It is not acutely toxic as ingestion of many milliliters is tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title=Medical Management Guidelines for Formaldehyde}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main concerns are associated with chronic (long term) exposure by inhalation. This may happen through three main sources: [[Thermal decomposition|thermal]] or [[chemical decomposition]] of formaldehyde-based resins, emission from [[aqueous]] formaldehyde solutions (i.e. embalming fluids), and the production of formaldehyde resulting from the [[combustion]] of a variety of organic compounds (for example, exhaust gases). As formaldehyde resins are used in many construction materials it is one of the more common indoor air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In fact, the expert panel found that a level of 1.0 ppm would avoid eye irritation—the most sensitive endpoint—in 75–95% of all people exposed.&lt;ref name="Dupont"&gt;[http://www2.dupont.com/Plastics/en_US/assets/downloads/processing/FETEG_Facts.pdf Formaldehyde and Facts About Health Effects] (PDF).

Formaldehyde levels in building environments are affected by a number of factors. These include the potency of formaldehyde-emitting products present, the ratio of the surface area of emitting materials to volume of space, environmental factors, product age, interactions with other materials, and ventilation condition. Formaldehyde emits from a variety of construction materials, furnishings, and consumer products. The three products that emit the highest concentrations are medium density fiberboard, hardwood plywood, and particle board. Environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity can elevate levels because formaldehyde has a high vapor pressure. Formaldehyde levels from building materials are the highest when a building first opens because materials would have less time to off-gas. Formaldehyde levels decrease over time as the sources suppress.

Formaldehyde levels in air can be sampled and tested in several ways, including impinger, treated sorbent, and passive monitors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110323024935/http://www.galsonlabs.com/services/referenceinfo/technical_bulletins.php?tb_id=18 When Sampling Formaldehyde, The Medium Matters]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has measurement methods numbered 2016, 2541, 3500, and 3800.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0293.html NIOSH Pocket Gide to Chemical Hazards: Formaldehyde]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on the interactions between formaldehyde and proteins at the molecular level have been reported on the effects of the body’s carrier protein, [[serum albumin]]. The binding of formaldehyde loosens the skeletal structure of albumin and exposure of aromatic ring amino acids in the internal hydrophobic region. Symptoms may affect personal awareness, making one feel tired or fatigued.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Formaldehyde inhalation has also shown to cause oxidative stress and inflammation in animals. Mice studied over an exposure to a high dose of formaldehyde (3ppm), showed increased [[Nitrate|NO{{su|b=3|p=−}}]] levels in plasma. This result suggests that FA inhalation either decreased [[Nitric oxide|NO]] production or increased NO scavenging, which may be an anti-stress mechanism in the body. Formaldehyde inhalation changes the sensitivity of immune system, which influences oxidative stress.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In June 2011, the twelfth edition of the [[National Toxicology Program]] (NTP) Report on Carcinogens (RoC) changed the listing status of formaldehyde from "reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen" to "known to be a human carcinogen."&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="12Report2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roc2011"/&gt; Concurrently, a [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) committee was convened and issued an independent review of the draft [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] IRIS assessment of formaldehyde, providing a comprehensive health effects assessment and quantitative estimates of human risks of adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/Addendum.pdf Addendum to the 12th Report on Carcinogens (PDF)] National Toxicology Program, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, retrieved 06-13-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===International bans===
Several web articles claim that formaldehyde has been banned from manufacture or import into the European Union (EU) under REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemical substances) legislation. This is misinformation, as official EU chemical databases{{which|date=May 2017}} contradict these claims as of February 19, 2010. This misconception has gained some ground. Formaldehyde is not listed in the Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 (export and import of dangerous chemicals regulation), nor on a priority list for risk assessment. However, formaldehyde is banned from use in certain applications (preservatives for liquid-cooling and processing systems, slimicides, metalworking-fluid preservatives, and antifouling products) under the Biocidal Products Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Hurricanes Katrina and Rita====
In the U.S. the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) provided [[Caravan (towed trailer)|travel trailers]], recreational park trailers and manufactured homes starting in 2006 for habitation by residents of the U.S. gulf coast displaced by [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]]. Some of the people who moved into the FEMA trailers complained of breathing difficulties, nosebleeds, and persistent headaches. Formaldehyde-catalyzed [[resins]] were used in the production of these homes.

The United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers For Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) performed indoor air quality testing for formaldehyde&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nmam/pdfs/2016.pdf CFC.gov (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; in some of the units. On February 14, 2008, the CDC announced that potentially hazardous levels of formaldehyde were found in many of the travel trailers and manufactured homes provided by the agency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080611220238/http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehhe/trailerstudy/pdfs/SummaryofStudyFindings.pdf Formaldehyde Levels in FEMA-Supplied Trailers (PDF)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Long-term exposure to levels in this range can be linked to an increased risk of cancer and, at levels above this range, there can also be a risk of respiratory illness. These levels are higher than expected in indoor air, where levels are commonly in the range of 0.01–0.02 ppm, and are higher than the Agency for Toxic Substance Disease Registry (ATSDR, division of the CDC) Minimal Risk Level (MRL) of 0.008 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mrls/index.html ATSDR – Minimal Risk Levels for Hazardous Substances (MRLs)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Levels measured ranged from 0.003 ppm to 0.59 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=42606 FEMA: CDC Releases Results Of Formaldehyde Level Tests&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contaminant in food==
Formaldehyde occurs naturally and is "an essential intermediate in cellular metabolism in mammals and humans."&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;  At high concentrations it is probably unhealthy. Scandals have broken in both the [[2005 Indonesia food scare]] and [[2007 Vietnam food scare]] regarding the addition of formaldehyde to foods to extend shelf life. In 2011, after a four-year absence, Indonesian authorities found foods with formaldehyde being sold in markets in a number of regions across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/74626/formaldehyde-laced-foods-reemerge-in-indonesian-markets|title=Formaldehyde-laced foods reemerge in Indonesian markets|date=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, at least at two [[Carrefour]] supermarkets, the Central [[Jakarta]] Livestock and Fishery Sub-Department found a sweet glutinous rice drink (cendol) contained 10 [[parts per million]] of formaldehyde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/health/formaldehyde-tainted-rice-drinks-found-at-carrefour-markets/460829|title=Formaldehyde-Tainted Rice Drinks Found at Carrefour Markets|date=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the owner of two noodle factories in Bogor, Indonesia; was arrested for using formaldehyde in noodles. 50&amp;nbsp;kg of formaldehyde was confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thejakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/bpom-uncovers-two-formaldehyde-tainted-noodle-factories-bogor/|title=BPOM Uncovers Two Formaldehyde-Tainted Noodle Factories in Bogor|date=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foods known to be contaminated included noodles, salted fish, and tofu. Chicken and beer were also rumored to be contaminated. In some places, such as China, manufacturers still use formaldehyde illegally as a preservative in foods, which exposes people to formaldehyde ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;Xiaojiang Tang et al., "[http://superfund.berkeley.edu/pdf/117.pdf Formaldehyde in China: Production, consumption, exposure levels, and health effects (PDF)]", ''Environment International'' 35 (2009): 1215–16, and other references cited on p. 1216; see also "[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2011-03/18/content_12189671.htm Municipality sees red over bad blood processing]" (2011-03-18, ''China Daily'', online English edition; retrieved on May 17, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, the ingestion of formaldehyde has been shown to cause vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, and in extreme cases can cause death. Testing for formaldehyde is by blood and/or urine by [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]]. Other methods include infrared detection, gas detector tubes, etc., of which HPLC is the most sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=formaldehyde testing |url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol88/mono88-6A.pdf |format=PDF |author=Moise Ngwa |date=2010-10-25|publisher=[[Cedar Rapids Gazette]]|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, it was frequently added by US milk plants to milk bottles as a method of pasteurization due to the lack of knowledge regarding formaldehyde's toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Was Death in the Milk? |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/888392/formaldehyde_in_milk/|newspaper=The Indianapolis News|date=July 31, 1900|page=5|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = August 20, 2014 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wants New Law Enacted.

==Biography==

===Childhood and education===
Grace Eldering was born in [[Rancher, Montana]], in 1900. Eldering's parents had immigrated to the United States before she was born, with her mother having arrived from [[Scotland]] and her father from the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=Virginia |date=2006 |title=''Bold Women in Michigan History'' |chapter=Pearl Kendrick and Grace Eldering: Sisters in Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJ73zYGsr4IC&amp;dq |publisher=[[Mountain Press Publishing]] |pages=69–78 |isbn=9780878425259 |accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She contracted and survived whooping cough when she was five, leading to her involvement in science in her adulthood.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Grace Eldering; Helped Develop Whooping Cough Vaccine |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-03/news/mn-2871_1_whooping-cough |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 3, 1988 |access-date=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school Eldering attended the [[University of Montana]] for four semesters before money troubles caused her to drop out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burns|first1=Virginia|title=Bold Women in Michigan History|date=2006|publisher=Mountain Press Publishing Company|location=Missoula, Montana|isbn=9780878425259|pages=69–79|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; She taught for four years saving up enough money to return to the university and obtain a [[Bachelor of Science]]. She then went on to teach at [[Hysham High School]] for an English class and a Biology class. She continued her education later in life and earned a Ph.D. in science in 1942 from [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref name="EID"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carolyn G. Shapiro-Shapin |date=August 2010 |title=Pearl Kendrick, Grace Eldering, and the Pertussis Vaccine |journal=[[Emerging Infectious Diseases]] |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=1273–1278 |doi=10.3201/eid1608.100288 |pmc=3298325 |pmid=20678322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
In 1928, Eldering moved to [[Lansing, Michigan]] to volunteer at Michigan Bureau of Laboratories. She was hired within six months to do routine bacteriologic analysis. She eventually moved to the Michigan Department of Health Laboratory in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] where she joined [[Pearl Kendrick]] and [[Loney Clinton Gordon]] to work on growing samples of [[pertussis]] bacteria in 1932. The development of the vaccine for pertussis also included the first "large-scale controlled clinical trial for pertussis vaccine".&lt;ref name="EID"/&gt; This was conducted by setting up a large network of medical professionals and neighborhood organizations in order to obtain large samples of pertussis from as many different patients as possible. Kendrick and Eldering started a "cough plate diagnostic service" on November 1, 1932, whereby cough plates of suspected infected individuals could be sent in for confirmation. This also allowed them to determine the time period of infectivity of pertussis and when those infected were at highest risk of infecting others around them. In addition, they set up a method of quarantine for Grand Rapids that would keep any outbreaks from spreading and required a 35-day period of isolation for infected patients. Within three years, their methods had become an official routine for the county and the state at large.&lt;ref name="EID"/&gt; While trying to create these methods Eldering and Kendrick faced many troubles while trying to find the funding to do so. Their research took place in the middle of the [[Great Depression]], making already scarce funding harder to get a hold of. They eventually received funding from federal emergency relief programs, city government and private donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shipiro-Shapin|first1=Carolyn G.|title=A Whole Community Working Together|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=ITOF&amp;u=msu_main&amp;id=GALE%7CA172597501&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=msu_main&amp;authCount=1|publisher=Michigan Historical Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole experiment was conducted after hours at work because the health department was so understaffed they couldn’t spend time on it during normal work hours. They also had nurse technicians and private physicians volunteer their time to help prepare and give the vaccine.

While the methods developed had allowed Kendrick and Eldering to make specific vaccines for those infected, they didn't begin work on a general vaccine until late 1933. Their outreach system among physicians, city officials, and school administrations allowed rapid inoculation of children and other city inhabitants. This trial ran for more than three years (March 1934-November 1937) and enrolled more than 5,815 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marks|first1=H. M.|title=The Kendrick-Eldering-(Frost) Pertussis Vaccine Field Trial|url=http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/articles/the-kendrick-eldering-frost-pertussis-vaccine-field-trial/|website=The James Lind Library|publisher=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design and procedures for the trials were a work in progress considering neither Kendrick or Eldering had experience in creating trials. In October 1935 the pair presented their preliminary findings at the annual [[American Public Health Association]] meeting. Many senior figures at this meeting did not want to endorse the vaccine they created because they felt it was not adequately tested. Eventually Kendrick and Eldering called in a consultant for their trial, [[Wade Hampton Frost]]. Frost was a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins and made two separate trips to Grand Rapids in November 1936, and in December 1937 to critique the trial and help make a plan for analyzing the results of the vaccine. They continued working on refining their inoculation methods through 1938, when they instituted a three vaccine system that involved less of the inactivated bacteria, but was found to be much more effective at providing resistance to infection. Mass production of this new version began across Michigan in 1938 and nationwide by 1940.&lt;ref name="EID"/&gt;

In 1951 ELdering succeeded Kendrick as Chief of the Western Michigan Laboratory of the Health Department, and remained there until she retired in 1969. Eldering continued to live in Grand Rapids and volunteer with the blind and physically handicapped until she died in 1988.

==Accolades==
Eldering was inducted into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1983 for her work in public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grace Eldering|url=http://www.michiganwomenshalloffame.org/Inductee_PDFs/Eldering_Grace.pdf|website=Michigan Women's Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the three [[Synoptic Gospels]] tells of [[Jesus]] '''healing the blind near Jericho''', as he passed through that town, shortly before his [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]]. 

The [[Gospel of Mark]] tells of the cure of a man named Bartimaeus healed by Jesus as he is leaving [[Jericho]]. The [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]] include different versions of this story.

==Narrative development==
The earliest version is in the  [[Gospel of Mark]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|10:46-52|NRSV}}) which tells of the cure of a blind beggar named Bartimaeus (literally "Son of Timaeus"). He is one of the few recipients of healing whose names evangelists let us know. Theologian [[Oleg Molenko]] (Uryupin) attributes this detail to the fact that these people had been definitely saved and served the Church in their lifetime unlike those whose names evangelists did not disclose. For example, in another instance of a man who had been an [[Disability|invalid]] for 38 years who waited for the movement of the water in a pool in the [[Gospel of John]] ({{bibleverse-nb||John|5:2-15|NRSV}}) and whose name remains unknown, Jesus cures that sick person and warns him about the consequences in case he reverts to doing things that brought him to the condition of infirmity of which he's now restored ({{bibleverse-nb||John|5:14|NRSV}}), as yet he might have had inclination towards sin. Unlike him, healed Bartimaeus follows Jesus immediately, which led the evangelist Mark to include his name in the narrative. Bartimaeus also teaches us a [[Jesus Prayer]], "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!", and, its result, an acquiring spiritual eyesight, the sign of which was his restored ability to see. &lt;ref&gt;Father Oleg Molenko, theologian, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQLsbxTU7Vs sermon "How can a blind person recover his sight through the name of Christ? (Russian: Как прозреть слепому силой имени Христа?)"], ''[[Youtube]]'', minutes 18-20, Finland, September, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As Jesus is leaving Jericho with his followers, Bartimaeus calls out:  'Son of David, have mercy on me!' and persists even though the crowd tries to silence him. Jesus has them bring the man to him and asks what he wants; he asks to be able to see again. Jesus tells him that his faith has cured him; he immediately regains his sight and follows Jesus.

Apart from telling a miracle story that shows the power of Jesus, the author of the Gospel uses this story to advance a clearly theological purpose. It shows a character who understands who Jesus is and the proper way to respond to him - with faith. The beggar, on being called to Jesus, discards his cloak, symbolising the leaving behind of possessions.  And the use of the title, 'Son of David' - the only occasion on which this is used in the Gospel of Mark - serves to identify Jesus as the Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Ahearne-Kroll, The Psalms of Lament in Mark's Passion: Jesus' Davidic Suffering (Cambridge University Press, 2007) pages 138-140&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gospel of Matthew]] has two unnamed blind men, sitting by the roadside; Jesus is 'moved by compassion' and touches their eyes. {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|20:29-34|NRSV}} A version of the same story is told earlier in the narrative, when Jesus is preaching in Galilee. On this occasion, he asks the blind men if they believe he can cure them, and when they assure them they do, he commends their faith and touches their eyes, restoring their sight.  He warns them to tell nobody of this, but they go and spread the news throughout the district. ([http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=305470137 Matthew 9:27-31])

The [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|18:35-43|NRSV}} handles the story in a different way; there is one unnamed blind man, and the author shifts the incident to take place as Jesus is approaching Jericho, so it can lead into the story of [[Zacchaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Luke Timothy Johnson, The Gospel of Luke (Liturgical Press, 1991) page 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Son of David==
[[Vernon K. Robbins]] emphasizes that the healing of Bartimaeus is the last of Jesus’ healings in Mark, and links Jesus’ earlier teaching about the suffering and death of the Son of Man with his Son of David activity in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Vernon41&gt;''Jesus the Teacher: A Socio-Rhetorical Interpretation of Mark'' by Vernon K. Robbins 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-8006-2595-5}}. 41-43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernon K. Robbins, [http://www.religion.emory.edu/faculty/robbins/Pdfs/Bartimaeus.pdf “The Healing of the Blind Bartimaeus (10:46-52) in the Marcan Theology”], ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' 92 (1973), 224-243&lt;/ref&gt; The story blends the Markan emphasis on the disciples’ 'blindness' - their inability to understand the nature of Jesus’ messiahship - with the necessity of following Jesus into Jerusalem, where his suffering and death make him recognizable to Gentiles{{Clarification needed|date=August 2018}} as Son of God.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon K. Robbins, "The Reversed Contextualization of Psalm 22 in the Markan Crucifixion: A Socio-Rhetorical Analysis" [http://www.religion.emory.edu/faculty/robbins/Pdfs/ReversedPs22Mark15.pdf] (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paula Fredriksen]], who believes that titles such as "[[Davidic line|Son of David]]" were applied to Jesus only after the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], argued that Mark and Matthew placed that healing with the proclamation "Son of David!" just before "Jesus' departure for [[Jerusalem]], the long-foreshadowed site of his sufferings."&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen, ''From Jesus to Christ'', p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;  The title "Son of David" is a [[Messiah|messianic]] name.&lt;ref name="Manila"&gt;"Reflections: The blind Bartimaeus: Mark 10:46-52," October 24, 2009, ''The Manila Bulletin'', [http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/226313/the-blind-bartimaeus The Manila Bulletin website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026044432/http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/226313/the-blind-bartimaeus |date=2009-10-26 }}, citing''365 Days with the Lord,'' (St. Paul's, Makati City, Philippines) from [http://www.stpauls.phstorefronts St. Paul's website (dead link)]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, accessed October 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bible study"&gt;Barrie Wetherill, "Jesus cures blind Bartimaeus," from ''The Life of Jesus Christ'', found at [http://www.easyenglish.info/bible-study/jesus-life/jesus_cures_blind_bartimaeus.htm easy English Bible study].  Accessed October 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Bartimaeus' exclamation was, according to Mark, the first ''public'' acknowledgement of the [[Christ]], after [[Confession of Peter|St. Peter's ''private'' confession]] at Mark {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|8:27–30|NIV}}.

==Bartimaeus==
The naming of Bartimaeus is unusual in several respects: (a) the fact that a name is given at all, (b) the strange Semitic-Greek hybrid, with (c) an explicit translation "Son of Timaeus." Some scholars see this as confirmation of a reference to a historical person;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Taylor. ''The Gospel according to St. Mark. 1966 St. Martin's Press Inc. p 448.&lt;/ref&gt; however, other scholars see a special significance of the story in the figurative reference to Plato's [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] who delivers Plato's most important cosmological and theological treatise, involving sight as the foundation of knowledge. 
&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Tolbert, ''Sowing the Gospel: Mark's World in Literary-Historical Perspective'' 1996, Fortress Press. p189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir '''Henry Duncan Littlejohn''' (1826 – 30 September 1914) was a Scottish surgeon, [[forensic scientist]] and [[public health]] pioneer. He is also known as an inspiration for the literary character [[Sherlock Holmes]].

==Life==

Henry Littlejohn was born in [[Edinburgh]] in 1826 to Isabella Duncan and Thomas Littlejohn, a confectioner of 33 Leith Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/83400915|title=Edinburgh Post Office annual directory, 1832-1833|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his studies at the [[Perth Academy]], before attending the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh]]. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with distinction in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lothianlives.org.uk/?page_id=1711 |title= Sir Henry Duncan Littlejohn: the beginning |publisher=Edinburgh City Archives |accessdate= 5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taught surgery by [[Alexander Monro (tertius)|Professor Alexander Monro]] and [[Robert Halliday Gunning|Dr Robert Halliday Gunning]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/research_awards/prizes/prize_lists/gunning_victoria_history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Littlejohn served as Edinburgh's first [[Medical Officer of Health]] (1862–1908), introducing model sanitation improvements and the legal requirement to [[Notifiable disease|notify cases of infectious diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst219.html|title=Sir Henry Duncan Littlejohn|work=Gazetteer for Scotland|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed significantly to the public health movement in Edinburgh and to public health administration and also to urban management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Laxton | first1 = Paul | last2 = Rodger | first2 = Richard | title = Insanitary City: Henry Littlejohn and the Condition of Edinburgh |isbn=1859362206| publisher = Carnegie Publishing Ltd. |year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Edinburgh City Hospital |author= Gray, J. A.  |publisher= Tuckwell Press | date=1999 |isbn= 1862320969}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assisted in later years by Dr [[Thomas William Drinkwater]] [[FRSE]].&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1940, p.391&lt;/ref&gt; Littlejohn also co-founded the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Royal Hospital for Sick Children]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.rcsed.ac.uk/docs/GD23_Papers_of_the_Littlejohns.pdf|title=The Littlejohn Collection|publisher=Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh Library &amp; Archive|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long a lecturer for the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] at [[Surgeons' Hall]], he was appointed to the [[Medical jurisprudence|Chair of Medical Jurisprudence]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1897.

Serving as Edinburgh's Police Surgeon from 1854 and as Medical Advisor to the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service|Crown in Scotland]] in criminal cases, he was often called upon as an [[expert witness]]. From 1862 he was Edinburgh's first Medical Officer of Health.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh: Mapping the City by Christopler Fleet and Daniel MacCannell&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Ministers and elders in the Church of Scotland|kirk elder]] at the [[St Giles' Cathedral|High Kirk of Edinburgh]], Littlejohn filled several prominent posts in public life, including nine years on the board of the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]], president of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] (1875–76), president of the [[Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh]] (1883–85), and president of the [[Royal Institute of Public Health]] (1893).

Although [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] primarily credited [[Joseph Bell]] as being the source of inspiration for his character [[Sherlock Holmes]], he also cited Henry Littlejohn as being a contributing influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Doyle |first=A. Conan |title=The Boys' Sherlock Holmes, New &amp; Enlarged Edition |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1961 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Littlejohn, as a forensic expert involved in police investigations, appears to have been joined by Bell on several investigations; furthermore, Littlejohn taught Doyle forensic medicine when Doyle was studying at the medical school of the University of Edinburgh.

Henry Littlejohn was knighted in 1895 by Queen Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lothianlives.org.uk/?page_id=1742|title=Sir Henry Duncan Littlejohn: Wider impact of his work|publisher=Edinburgh City Archives|accessdate =1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later life he lived at 24 Royal Circus in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's Second New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1905-6&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at Benreoch, near [[Arrochar, Argyll and Bute|Arrochar]] in Argyll in 1914, and was interred at the [[Dean Cemetery]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.2806.648-b|pmc=2299842| title = SIR HENRY D. LITTLEJOHN, M.D., LL.D.Edin., F.R.C.S.E| journal = BMJ| volume = 2| issue = 2806| pages = 648| year = 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grave is on the edge of the southern path towards the west end. He is buried with his wife, Isabella Jane Harvey, and their children.

==Henry Harvey Littlejohn==

Sir Henry was the father of Henry Harvey Littlejohn (1862-1927) (normally just called Harvey Littlejohn during his life but posthumously largely called Henry) who followed in his father's footsteps and continued his adoption of tangential thinking to resolve investigations. His early years were spent at the family home, then at 40 York Place.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1863-64&lt;/ref&gt;

H. H. Littlejohn adopted unusual methods of study. This included mapping instances of [[typhoid]] across [[Edinburgh]] in 1891 in conjunction with the noted map-maker, [[John George Bartholomew|J. G. Bartholomew]]. The purpose of this was to track down the source of the outbreak. This technique is now common practice in police techniques to observe patterns in pursuit of crime detection.

The results, published in the Edinburgh Medical Journal in March 1891, proved the outbreak centred upon a property at Gardner's Crescent, in the west of the city, with almost all neighbouring houses becoming infected. He then tracked the original source to a batch of milk from one individual farm, tracked down all the shops that it supplied, and had all milk destroyed (compensating the shop-owners).&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh: Mapping the City, Christopher Fleet and Daniel MacCannell&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[William Turner (anatomist)|Sir William Turner]], [[Alexander Crum Brown]], and Sir [[Thomas Richard Fraser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the first persons in the world to be appointed as Chief Police Surgeon for a city (1906).

In later life Harvey Littlejohn lived at 1 Atholl Crescent in Edinburgh's West End.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1905-6&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at a nursing home in [[Edinburgh]] on 15 August 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://library.rcsed.ac.uk/docs/GD23_Papers_of_the_Littlejohns.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080820/https://library.rcsed.ac.uk/docs/GD23_Papers_of_the_Littlejohns.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Harvey is buried in his father's plot at [[Dean Cemetery]].

IDIRIYA was born from its founder’s passion for creating an environment that is accessible to all BY DESIGN with dignity, regardless of the degree of physical ability.

Based in [[Sri Lanka]], IDIRIYA comprises a group of [[professionals]] in diverse fields who offer their expertise and follow the [[principle]] that ''good [[design]] [[Enabling|enables]] bad design disables''.

They have aggressively promoted in Sri Lanka the concept of '[[Social Inclusion]] for All' by design focusing on [[built environment]]s - Safety being a paramount feature - that does not marginalise or discriminate against people on the grounds of inevitable diversity in ability and campaigned against arbitrary categorization of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ockersz | first = Lynn | title = Disability no dead-end | work = Features, OP-ED Page | publisher = Lake House - Daily News | date = 2006-03-27 | url = http://www.dailynews.lk/2006/03/27/fea05.asp | accessdate = 2009-02-02 | quote = Perera, has been ''aggressively promoting in Sri Lanka, with relentless commitment, the concept of ' social inclusion for all' focusing on built environments that does not marginalise or discriminate against people on the grounds of inevitable diversity in ability and campaigned against arbitrary categorization of people''.

The ''marginalisation and discrimination by the society'' the restricted mobility brings is ''the principal problem. in this context''. Accordingly, the prime challenge facing those dealing with our built environment - such as architects and designers - is to create 'enabling environments', which facilitate the mobility of all - the disabled included. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070111021310/http://www.dailynews.lk/2006/03/27/fea05.asp | archivedate = 11 January 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although IDIRIYA do not seek to people with restricted ability, they support and strive to [[Empowerment|emPower]] them to lobby individually and collectively for positive change of a dis-''A''bling society by design, to benefit their own day-to-day productive lives.

The organisation receives no outside funding  and has been kept functioning by voluntary contributions of time and resources, mainly by its members.

== History ==

IDIRIYA was founded in 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2006/04/02/fea21.html IDIRIYA launch - Enabling the 'Able yet Unable'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101082758/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2006/04/02/fea21.html |date=1 November 2010 }}, Sunday Observer features, Retrieved 2 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  by [[disability rights activist|disability activist]] [[Ajith C. S. Perera]].

It was born from Perera’s '''(i).'''. Passion for creating an environment that is accessible and user-friendly equally to everyone, enabling choice and with dignity, '''(ii).'''. Commitment to make a consciousness-raising eye-opener on accessibility to built environments, technology, goods and services and '''(iii).'''. Desire to promote [[universal design]] principles.

IDIRIYA have identified  ''two prerequisites'' for a formidable and sustainable national economy: Viz. '''(i)'''. Arresting the waste of productive human potential through mobilising the productive value of all people, able-bodied or otherwise, and '''(ii)'''. Minimising unwanted dependents through empowering people.

They believe that construction of environments for ''inclusion of all people'' and [[Organizing (management)|optimum use]] of [[Information and communication technologies|technology]] in daily life is cost effective, realistic and the effective way to arrest colossal waste of precious assets, enhances gainful  opportunities for an increasing wide range of people and make everyone meaningful equal partners in Sri Lankan National development.

They realise the need for a new and more positive understanding and changing reactions to dis-ability and its related key issues.

This requires opening of minds to the [[social model of disability]] that explains how it's the dis-''A''bling designs of social environment that renders a wide and diverse range of people increasingly dis-''A''bled.

==Vision==

IDIRIYA’s vision is: Safety and Inclusion with Accessibility to [[wikt:empower|Empower]] People of All Abilities. [[Enabling]] the people who are severely ‘disadvantaged’ or ‘marginalised’ in day-to-day normal life due to continuing poor building design and thereby establishing a society that does not discriminate against people with limited mobility - an inevitable fact as life unfolds.

==Mission==

IDIRIYA’s mission is: ''Creating awareness'', ''Engaging support'' and ''Catalysing change'' actively  to promote built environments that can be used equally and safely by all sectors of society, with choice, with dignity and without any hindrance.

The Simultaneous focus here is on two key aspects.

1). To design and conduct educational and awareness programmes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.island.lk/2008/06/04/midweek6.html Access Ability For All], Island Midweek, Retrieved 4 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sundaytimes.lk/080622/Plus/timesplus0015.html Designing to Include], Sunday Times Plus, Retrieved  22 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2006/09/23/fea14.asp Enabling Environments for Better Health], Daily News Health Watch, Retrieved 23 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/06/01/imp11.asp Accessibility is a national issue], Sunday Observer Features, Retrieved 1 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as an ongoing process, to stimulate the interest - and thereby induce a positive change in attitudes - to deliver better living environments and thereby to make communities liveable by everyone.

2). To provide the right guidance and proper advice,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/12/10/fea002.asp Random thoughts on ‘World Human Rights Day’] . Daily News, Retrieved on 10 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; when required, to those who desire to construct or modify environments or even a mixture of both, so as to be [[empowerment|enabling]] equally for everyone.

==Work==

Their work,&lt;ref name=possibilities&gt;"[http://www.island.lk/2007/11/25/features7.html Brimming possibilities in the disabled]", Sunday Island features, Retrieved 25 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in performing the dual roles of [[accessibility]] [[:wikt:adviser|advisers]] and [[Disability access auditor|accessibility auditors of built environments]], is all about making a positive difference to the '''quality of human lives''' of ''able'' people who are [[disadvantaged]] or [[marginalised]] by dis-''A''bling society as they experience, for different reasons, restricted ability, [[social mobility|mobility]] in particular and their '''safety''' in day-to-day life.

==Aims==

Their aims&lt;ref name=possibilities/&gt; are not to make profits. All members work in continuing to be: exceptionally responsive towards ''[[Disability access auditor|designing for inclusion of all]]'', regardless of the degree of physical ability, and thereby [[Empowerment|emPowering]] everyone through 'increased opportunities' in daily life, to be more productive and gainful, healthier and full-fledged citizens.

==Significant contributions==

IDIRIYA recognise the fact that disability related internationally accepted [[Design to standards|design standards]] and regulations in building construction and design of key building parts by professionals in this vital industry, often run high risks of failure and thereby waste of resources in terms of practical implementation, if not backed by a good understanding of its intricacies and practical experience, as ''theory without practice is blind''.

They realise that: Access and emPowerment of People of all Abilities is a crucial subject of national importance.

They further recognise that: (i). Accessibility experts need to perform a highly specialised job, yet under-estimated and unrecognized in Sri Lanka.  (ii). Absence of the services of experienced accessibility experts is the missing link in Sri Lanka fuelling [[social exclusion]] and denial of enjoying several rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaytimes.lk/151129/sunday-times-2/dont-dis-the-ability-of-the-largest-minority-172879.html  The imperative need for accessibility experts – the missing link]. Sunday Times - 2, Retrieved on 25 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymirror.lk/97781/don-t-dis-the-ability-of-the-largest-minority  The accessibility experts – the missing link]. Daily Mirror, Retrieved on 23 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

They understand that the crucial role of an accessibility expert requires an in-depth understanding of intricacies backed by wide practical experience and thorough working knowledge on this subject that goes much far and beyond than what the university courses on architecture and civil engineering teach in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/?q=2015/12/03/features/don%E2%80%99t-%E2%80%98dis%E2%80%99-ability-largest-minority Accessibility Experts need to perform a highly specialised job, yet are under-estimated and unrecognised in Sri Lanka.]. Daily News, Retrieved on 26 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not one where standards and specifications can be read and applied in vital tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.lk/article/503133/Don-t--dis--the-ability-of-the-largest-minority  The crucial role of an accessibility expert]. Daily FT, Retrieved on 25 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
As such, authorities undertaking such tasks of National importance often need expert guidance from those with insight, enough of practical experience and proven competence as to how best to do this [[Humanitarian]] work rightly first time.

To ease the difficulty of finding the right help IDIRIYA has also stepped in here.

Several organisations in Sri Lanka, both large and small, who desire to design and deliver better environments that can be used equally and safely by ''all sectors of society'', regardless of their degree of [[wikt:ability|ability]], with dignity and with safety, have already benefited to get what they want here with the right guidance of Idiriya '''-''' a good testimony to their sincere commitment and proven competence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.lk/2008/11/30/eyefea4.htm Ability within Disability], The Nation, Retrieved 30 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdfs.island.lk/2007/10/09/p8.pdf An Enabling Environment for All], The Island, Retrieved 9 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.lk/2008/06/29/busi10.htm Achievers Recognised and Appreciated], The Nation, Retrieved on 29 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

IDIRIYA in 2007 initiated action and paved the way in the establishment and launch of the ''first Sri Lanka Standard for design in building construction'' by the Sri Lanka Standards Institution - SLS ISO TR 9527:2006 - taking into consideration diversity in ability of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Design to include, not exclude, all people | publisher = Organisation of Professional Associations (OPA) | date = 2007-11-29 | url = http://www.dailynews.lk/2007/11/29/fea06.asp | accessdate = 2009-03-15 | quote = …. the Government (of Sri Lanka) has declared 2007/08 as the ‘Year of Access’ and the ''Sri Lanka Standards Institution (on an initiative made by this writer) responded expeditiously to establish a Sri Lanka Standard for building construction'' (reference: SL/ISO/TR/9527:2006.) | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604192756/http://www.dailynews.lk/2007/11/29/fea06.asp | archivedate = 4 June 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Perera | first = Ajith C.

==Major achievements==

[[ACCESSIBILITY at Built Environments|Accessibility to built environments]] is an indispensable [[Human rights|inherent basic human right]].

Laws to require public buildings and facilities to be designed and constructed accessible to dis-abled persons were established in Sri Lanka in 1996 and further strengthened by the introduction of accessibility regulations under this law in 2005 and thereafter, receiving unanimous Parliament approval 0n 20 March 2007.
 
However, inept bureaucracy failed to establish a formal mechanism to implement and pursue the legislation and thereby to deliver practical effect, even in respect of new public buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Supreme Court order propels ‘accessibility for all’ | work = Features - Page 16 | publisher = Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited – Daily News | date = 2009-11-13 | url = http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/11/13/fea25.asp | accessdate = 2010-01-24 | quote = Perhaps for the first time, the unassuming but able voice of disabled persons praying for ‘justice to access public facilities’ echoed loud and clears at the country's apex court. "&lt;br&gt;" A fundamental rights application aimed at preventing further colossal losses the country incurs, was filed at the Supreme Court by Dr. Ajith C. S. Perera. Submissions were made on behalf of IDIRIYA by this disabled petitioner appearing in person. '''It was a significant achievement, 'not simply' but the hard way'''. "&lt;br&gt;" Laws to require public buildings and facilities to be made accessible to disabled persons were established in 1996 and further strengthened by the introduction of accessibility regulations under this law in 2005 and thereafter, receiving unanimous Parliament approval. "&lt;br&gt;" '''However, inept stagnant bureaucracy failed to establish a formal mechanism to implement and pursue the legislation and thereby to deliver practical effect, even in respect of new public buildings'''. "&lt;br&gt;" "The Court recognised that in terms of the 'Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities' Act No. 28 of 1996 and accessibility regulations made there under, no person should be discriminated on the ground of disability and their mobility restricted in a manner which precludes or impedes them from gaining reasonable physical access to public buildings and facilities provided within such buildings, especially the toilet facilities. "&lt;br&gt;".Accordingly, the Court ordered the following. "&lt;br&gt;".1. All new public buildings as defined in the accessibility regulations No.1 of 2006, should provide 'reasonable access' to persons with physical disabilities. "&lt;br&gt;" 2. All authorities that are empowered to approve building plans or issue any 'Certificate of Conformity' for public buildings should refrain from doing so in respect of any building which would violate this court order. "&lt;br&gt;" 3. Failure to comply would draw punitive repercussions as set out in the law (which would very soon be made more stringent) . "&lt;br&gt;" 4. The proceedings were terminated with liberty to you to file a motion, if there is any violation of the court orders. "&lt;br&gt;" Clarification of court orders . "&lt;br&gt;" What's acceptable as 'reasonable access'? It means the following key parts of a new public building stipulated by the accessibility regulations in force, not just the entrances, should be designed in accordance with the minimum design requirements there: floor surfaces, pathways and corridors, doors and entrances, steps and stairs, hand rails and grab bars, ramps (where needed), lifts, toilets, car parks and signage. "&lt;br&gt;" Design requirements provide the basic essential architectural needs that address the diverse mobility needs of the widest possible range of persons. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604051017/http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/11/13/fea25.asp | archivedate = 4 June 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Violators roam scot-free, significant setbacks to gainful opportunities of disabled people, increasing numbers hence driven towards poverty affecting even their immediate families, waste of human potential, etc., and thereby reduce our limited resources causing substantial losses to the country.

Even after 15 years this malady continues as the non-disabled decision makers fail to recognise this national disaster.

Seeking redress for physically dis-''A''bled persons accessing ''new'' public buildings, a fundamental rights application [Ref: SCFR: 221/2009] aimed at preventing further colossal losses the country incurs, was filed by IDIRIYA at the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in March 2009.

[[Ajith C. S. Perera]], honorary [[chief administrative officer|Secretary-General]] and [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive]] of IDIRIYA (as at 25 December 2015) appearing in person, argued the need to have the disability access laws and regulations already enacted some years ago, fully enforced and implemented with respect to ''new'' [[public buildings]] in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ockersz | first = Lynn | title = Landmark Supreme Court ruling – A fillip for accessibility rights of disabled. | work = News - Page 17 | publisher = Upali Newspapers - The Sunday Island | date = 2009-11-08 | url = http://www.island.lk/2009/11/08/news-17.jpg | accessdate = 2010-01-26 | quote= ''The right of the disabled to have unhindered access to public buildings received a substantial boost when the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka ruled on 14 October 2009, that, among other things, all new public buildings in the country should conform fully to already enacted disability access laws and regulations''. "&lt;br&gt;". Buildings in the commercial, recreational, social, educational, residential and industrial categories are expected to come under the purview of these laws, which were included in the statute book some years ago, but which have come to be seen as not fully and energetically implemented."&lt;br&gt;"  In terms of the SC order, made in respect of case no. SC (FR) 221/2009, these categories of buildings should render their facilities accessible to the disabled, including toilets’, said '''''Dr, Ajit C. Perera, the disability rights activist, who personally represented matters for the disabled before the SC''''', subsequent to him ''petitioning the Court on the need to have the laws fully enforced and implemented''. "&lt;br&gt;".He said that in addition to toilets, the following ‘key parts’ of buildings should be constructed in accordance with ‘design requirements’ set out in the law: entrances, floor surfaces, pathways and corridors, doors, steps and stairs, hand rails, grab bars, ramps, lifts, car parks and signage. "&lt;br&gt;".The SC order further states that all authorities who are empowered to approve building plans or issue any ‘Certificates of Conformity’ for public buildings, should refrain from doing so in respect of any buildings which violate these orders. "&lt;br&gt;".‘Any violations of the court order would incur punitive repercussions and would be seen as Contempt of Court’, Perera explained.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bench headed by the then country's [[Chief Justice of Sri Lanka|Chief Justice]] and the country's current [[Chief Justice of Sri Lanka|Chief Justice]] as at 1 January 2016, in delivering their unanimous judgement on 27 April 2011 which further strengthened the order given earlier on 14 October 2009, issued landmark orders having the potential to reverse these adverse trends and reap over 30 rich dividends for the country and its people - disabled and non-disabled alike.
 
This has been recognised in [[Sri Lanka]] as a significant achievement towards equalisation of opportunities, 'not simply' but the hard way, ''by the dis-abled for the dis-abled''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7829">The '''Jacksonville Developmental Center''' was an institution for developmentally delayed clients, located in [[Jacksonville, Illinois]].  It was open from 1851 to November 2012.&lt;ref name="sjr-moved-out"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.sj-r.com/breaking/x35745822/Last-of-Jacksonville-Developmental-Center-residents-moved-out | title = Last of Jacksonville Developmental Center residents moved out | first = John | last = Reynolds | work = [[The State Journal-Register]] | location = [[Springfield, Illinois]] | publisher = [[GateHouse Media]] | date = Nov 29, 2012 &lt;!-- @ 10:36 PM  --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2012|12}}, the {{convert|134|acre|sp=us|adj=on}} grounds was still owned by the State of Illinois.&lt;ref name="sjr-moved-out"/&gt;

==History==
Illinois originally did not have any system for caring for its mentally ill citizens who were either living with their family or kept in local almshouses.
[[Dorothea Dix]] lobbied the state legislature to create a facility in Illinois designed for the care of the mentally ill. On March 1, 1847, the legislature established the '''Illinois State Asylum and Hospital for the Insane''' with a nine-member board of trustees that was empowered to appoint a superintendent, purchase land within four miles of Jacksonville, and construct facilities. (L. 1847, p.&amp;nbsp;52).  At the time, only two other states had state-operated facilities for the mentally ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Elgin Mental Health Center: Evolution of a State Hospital|first=William|last=Briska|publisher=Crossroads Communications|year=1997|page=9|isbn=0-916445-45-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital was created to shift the economic burden of the mentally ill onto the state, which paid all of the patients' expenses.  However, patients (or their county of residence) remained responsible for transportation, clothing and incidentals.

At the time, institutions for the mentally ill either had a number of small cottages, or a single large central building under the [[Kirkbride Plan]]. The trustees selected Kirkbride's approach for the new institution. The center building was five and a half stories high, with two separate wings for each gender extending with staggered setbacks from the center.  In 1984, the building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], although it was demolished in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/IL/Morgan/state.html Retrieved 2009-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the buildings was begun in 1848 and James M. Higgins was hired as Superintendent. Although Dix had expressed interest that Jacksonville State Hospital be opened by 1849, it wasn't until November 3, 1851, that the first two wards were ready for occupancy and the first patient, Sophronia McElhiney, of McLean County, was admitted.

In 1860, [[Elizabeth Packard|Elizabeth P.W. Packard]]'s husband had her committed to Jacksonville against her will, due to a disagreement over her religious beliefs.  At the time, Illinois law (which was enacted when the hospital opened) had an exception to its commitment hearing requirement to allow husbands to confine their wives to an asylum without any hearing. After three years, she was discharge from the hospital. Her husband then imprisoned her in their home, and after gaining her freedom through a lawsuit, she formed the Anti-Insane Asylum Society. She led a campaign to amend the Illinois law to guarantee a public hearing for all people declared insane, including women whose husbands wished to have them committed. She also saw similar laws passed in three other states.

Jacksonville remained Illinois' only such hospital until two additional facilities, [[Elgin State Hospital|the hospital at Elgin]] and [[Anna State Hospital|the hospital at Anna]], were authorized in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Elgin Mental Health Center: Evolution of a State Hospital|first=William|last=Briska|publisher=Crossroads Communications|year=1997|pages=12–13|isbn=0-916445-45-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the legislature renamed Jacksonville as the '''Illinois Central Hospital for the Insane''', assumed primary responsibility for patients from the counties of central Illinois. As a part of this reorganization, the legislature also reduced the size of Jacksonville's board of trustees to three members and the newly created a new statewide Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities to supervise all state institutions while each one retained its own separate board.

When the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities was abolished in 1909, the institute was reorganized and renamed '''Jacksonville State Hospital''' effective January 1, 1910.  In 1917, the Department of Public Welfare assumed responsibility for Jacksonville State Hospital and retained control until the creation of the Illinois Department of Mental Health in 1961 (L. 1961, p.&amp;nbsp;2666).

From 1944 to 1974, the hospital provided training in psychiatric nursing for students from general hospital nursing schools. Jacksonville's Psychiatric Nursing Affiliation Program, which was headed by the State Alienist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mantenostatehospital.com/jacksonville.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102204521/http://www.mantenostatehospital.com/jacksonville.html |archivedate=January 2, 2016 }} Retrieved 2009-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Jacksonville State Hospital's duties expanded beyond in-patient care of mental illness to include treatment for the *developmentally disabled." To reflect this change in mission, the legislature renamed it the '''Jacksonville Mental Health and Developmental Center'''' in 1975.  (P.A. 79-581, p.&amp;nbsp;1895.)  Jacksonville phased out its in-patient treatment of mental illness and its name was changed one last time to reflect its new mission.

===Final years===
When closed, the Jacksonville Developmental Center treated primarily developmentally delayed patients, some of whom also had [[mental illness]]es.  The center was operated by the [[Illinois Department of Human Services]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

{{As of|2009|6|30|alt=As of the end of fiscal year 2009}}, Jacksonville had 400 [[employee]]s and an appropriation of $30,107,300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=36224|title=Jacksonville Developmental Center – GRF|accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, [[Governor]] [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] announced a plan to close the facility in February 2012 due to budget issues.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The last residents were moved out in late November 2012.&lt;ref name="sjr-moved-out"/&gt;

'''Kent/Sussex Detoxification Center''', is a state funded, 20 bed medical facility in the SAMSHA Drug and Alcohol Rehab Programs category. The facility is located in [[Ellendale, Delaware]] in the former Ellendale public school on [[Main Street]]. It was opened in 1974.  This facility is one of only two detoxification centers in the state, with the other being Kirkwood Detox Center. In 2005, the facility serviced an average of 14.8 patients per day and in 2006 the facility serviced an average of 12.2 patients per day.

The detox center was a part of a controversy in September 2006 when a man called the medical facility to learn about being admitted for alcohol abuse.{{cn|date=February 2016}} When the staff learned he only had [[Medicaid]], he was denied treatment as the state-funded facility did not accept Medicaid at that time. Two days later, his body was discovered as he had hanged himself in his backyard the night he had been denied entry into the program.

It was closed temporarily in 2009 when it was transferred to a private company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=One of Two Delaware Detox Clinics to Close |url=http://www.wboc.com/story/10738920/one-of-two-delaware-detox-clinics-to-close |accessdate=8 September 2018 |publisher=WBOC |date=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lee Brown Coye''' (July 24, 1907 – September 5, 1981) was an [[United States|American]] [[artist]].

Coye is probably best remembered for his black-and-white illustrations for [[pulp magazine]]s and [[horror fiction]], but he produced a variety of works in other media.

==Biography==
Coye was born in [[Syracuse, New York]], and as a young man lived in nearby [[Tully (town), New York|Tully]]. He spent his entire life in the Central New York area.

He and his wife, Ruth, lived in Syracuse for many years where Coye's activities included teaching adult art classes; working under the [[Works Progress Administration]] to paint a mural in the Cazenovia High School in 1934 (since destroyed); advertising for the [[WSYR (AM)|WSYR]] Broadcasting System in upstate New York, producing a variety of commissioned works.

The Coyes settled in [[Hamilton (village), New York|Hamilton, New York]], in 1959 when Lee went to work for Sculptura, a small company that reproduced antique sculptures. The move to Hamilton allowed Coye to fulfill his ambition of returning to a small town and maintaining his own art studio.

Coye was almost entirely self-taught as an artist,&lt;ref name="nyjb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Squirek|first1=Mark|title=A Review of Pulp Macabre: The Art of Lee Brown Coye's Final and Darkest Hour|url=http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/pulp-macabre|publisher=New York Journal of Books|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his entire life was devoted to art-related work. As a young man, he attended one semester of night art classes, but his artistic knowledge and abilities came from many years of work and a thorough study of nature. His astute knowledge of body parts developed from his studies of anatomy and his work as a medical illustrator. He spent time attending operations and [[autopsy|autopsies]], thus becoming extremely familiar with the human body assembled or not.

==Recurring motifs ==
One recurring feature in Coye's work is the motif of wooden sticks, often in [[latticework]]-like patterns.&lt;ref name="nyjb" /&gt; This was inspired by a 1938 discovery in an abandoned farmhouse.

Coye had returned to the [[North Pitcher, New York]], area where he spent much of his childhood. While wandering deep in the woods, Coye discovered an abandoned farmhouse. Boards and pieces of wood which had been set perpendicular to one another surrounded the site. Neither inside nor out could Coye find an explanation for the presence of these crossed sticks. In the years following, Coye remained interested in the significance of his discovery.

When Coye returned to the site in 1963, there was nothing left of the building or the sticks (the area had suffered severe flooding), and he never found out why the sticks were there or who it was that had arranged them in such a manner. Because of the strangeness of the entire experience, these forms never left Coye, and they appear in many of his paintings and illustrations.

The incident also inspired Coye's friend [[Karl Edward Wagner]] to write the award-winning story "[[Sticks (short story)|Sticks]]". A four-page portfolio of Coye's work accompanies the printing of Wagner's story in [[Gahan Wilson]], ed. ''First World Fantasy Awards''. NY: Doubleday, 1977, (between pages 168 and 169).

The [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] was an early Coye motif in paintings and illustrations.&lt;ref name="nyjb" /&gt; The [[whale]] became a later signature motif. Coye fashioned wooden sculptures, silver [[pendant]]s and pins, engravings, drawings, and a large painting of the whale. One very fine example is in the Morrisville State College Library collection the {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} pine "[[Moby-Dick]]" sculpture created in 1965. [http://library.morrisville.edu/images/coye/whale.jpg Image of Moby Dick Sculpture]

==Illustrator of the macabre ==
[[File:Weird Tales July 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Coye's cover for the ''Weird Tales'']]
[[File:Fantastic 196306.jpg|thumb|right|Coye provided the cover for [[Robert Arthur, Jr.|Robert Arthur]]'s "The Mirror of Cagliostro " on the June 1963 issue of ''[[Fantastic Stories]]'']]

Coye's fame as an illustrator of the [[macabre]] developed as a result of his drawings for three horror anthologies edited by [[August Derleth]] in the early 1940s, ''Sleep No More'' (1944), ''Who Knocks'' (1946), and ''The Night Side'' (1947). This subsequently led to additional work for ''[[Weird Tales]]'', a popular pulp magazine. Coye's work first appeared in the March 1945 issue of ''Weird Tales'', illustrating the story 'Please Go Way and Let Me Sleep" by Helen Kasson. This tale gave Coye the chance to show dead bodies in various states of decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;Gahan Wilson, "Lee Brown Coye: An Appreciation'', in Wilson, ed. ''First World Fantasy Awards'', NY: Doubleday, 1977, pp. 256-57.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1945 to 1952, his covers and interior work, in a long and fruitful association with the magazine, captured images of horror and the supernatural.&lt;ref name="nyjb" /&gt; A review of ''Pulp Macabre: The Art of Lee Brown Coye's Final and Darkest Hour'' said his work for ''Weird Tales'' produced "some of the magazine's greatest covers and as well as some of the most memorable illustrations to ever appear in pulps". In the 1960s, Coye's work appeared in such magazines as ''Fantastic'' and ''Amazing''.

Coye illustrated, as well as the [[H. P. Lovecraft]] collection, ''[[Three Tales of Horror]]'' (Arkham House, 1967), and two deluxe collections of pulp stories edited by [[Karl Edward Wagner]] and published by his imprint [[Carcosa]] : [[Manly Wade Wellman]]'s ''Worse Things Waiting'' (1975) and [[Hugh B. Cave]]'s ''Murgunstrumm and Others'' (1978). Coye won the [[World Fantasy Award]] for best artist in 1975 and 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winners|url=http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/winners/|publisher=World Fantasy Convention|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coye was in the midst of illustrating Cave's volume [[Death Stalks the Night]], which would have been the fifth volume published by North Carolina publishing house [[Carcosa]], when he suffered a crippling stroke and eventually died. The volume's editor, [[Karl Edward Wagner]], abandoned plans to publish through Carcosa, however the volume was eventually issued, with the illustrations Coye had completed, by [[Fedogan and Bremer]].

==Other work==
Although Coye is best known for his fantasy and horror illustrations, for more than fifty years his artistic output covered a much wider range. He was a watercolor, oil, and egg [[tempera]] painter, a [[muralist]], a [[Sculpture|sculptor]], a photographer, a [[silversmith]], and an able builder of models and [[dioramas]]. From rats and [[beetles]] and disfigured bodies, to whales, mythic figures, and landscapes, Coye's subjects are as diverse as the media in which he worked. All of his work was executed with expert craftsmanship, and exhibits the originality that sprang from his renowned imagination and sense of humor. Coye created paintings, sculpture, and jewelry that are as beautiful as his illustrations are macabre.

Coye exhibited at the [[Whitney Museum]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. His work is represented in numerous collections including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lee Brown Coye-Dark house|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/487923|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Everson Museum]] in Syracuse, the [[Onondaga County]] Historical Society, Picker Art Gallery at [[Colgate University]], the [[Morrisville State College]] Library, [[SUNY Oswego]], [[Syracuse University]], and private collections.

In 2015 ''Where Is Abby? &amp; Other Tales'' was published.&lt;ref name="cadabra"&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Is Abby? &amp; Other Tales|url=http://www.cadabrarecords.com/2015/08/where-is-abby-other-tales/|publisher=Cadabra Records|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book features some stories from Coye's "Chips and Shavings" Coye's column printed by "Mid-York Weekly" newspaper between 1964 and 1970.&lt;ref name="Abby"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lee Brown Coye Where Is Abby? &amp; Other Tales|url=https://lightintheattic.net/releases/1929-where-is-abby-other-tales|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these tales (based on true stories) also appears (as "From Chips and Shavings") in [[Gahan Wilson]], ed. ''First World Fantasy Awards''. NY: Doubleday, 1977, pp.&amp;nbsp;277–78.

The book ''Pulp Macabre: The Art of Lee Brown Coye's Final and Darkest Era'' was published in 2015.&lt;ref name="feral"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pulp Macabre|url=http://feralhouse.com/pulp-macabre/|publisher=Feral House|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article, with interviews by the editors of the book, described Coye's illustrations as "whimsical and cartoonish" at first glance but "spine-chilling" with a closer look.&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sokol|first1=Zach|title='Pulp Macabre': The Art of a Guy Who Used to Bring Severed Heads to the Bar|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/avy9kz/pulp-macabre-lee-brown-coye-book-interview-777|publisher=VICE|accessdate=12 September 2017|date=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Image-bat-hist-04b.jpg|thumb|300px|The hangings of the ''[[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]]'' mutineers in 1629, the first Europeans to be executed in Australia]]
Before the arrival of Europeans, death sentences were carried out in Australia under [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] customary law, either directly or through sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aboriginal Customary Laws and Sentencing|url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/21.%20Aboriginal%20Customary%20Laws%20and%20Sentencing/aboriginal-customary-laws-and-notion-'puni|website=Australian Law Reform Commission|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first executions under European law occurred on 2 October 1629 on Long Island in the [[Houtman Abrolhos]] of [[Western Australia]], where seven crew members of the [[Dutch East India Company]] ship [[Batavia (ship)|''Batavia'']] were hanged for mutiny and the subsequent massacre of 125 passengers and crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Batavia's History|url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/research/research-areas/maritime-archaeology/batavia-cape-inscription/batavia|website=Western Australian Museum|publisher=Government of Western Australia|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within weeks of the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] in 1788 and the establishment of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]] as the first permanent European settlement, Thomas Barrett became the first person to be executed in Australia under British law.

From 1820 onwards, the total number executed in Australia was 1,648.&lt;ref name="aic.gov.au"&gt;Ivan Potas &amp; John Walker, "Capital punishment", no. 3 in Trends &amp; issues in crime and criminal justice ISSN: 0817-8542 https://aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi03&lt;/ref&gt;

State boundaries have changed during Australia's history. For the purpose of this article, the executions listed below are divided geographically according to state and territory boundaries as they have existed since 1989.

==New South Wales==

(this list is incomplete)
The total number of executions in NSW by decade beginning 1820 were: 170 in 1820s, 288 in 1830s, 99 in 1840s, 36 in 1850s, 51 in 1860s, 23 in 1870s, 26 in 1880s, 67 in 1890s, 12 from 1900-1909, 5 from 1910–19, 2 in 1920s, 4 in 1930s and 1 in 1940s.&lt;ref name="aic.gov.au"/&gt; This confirms that names are missing below.

* Empower countries to make evidence-based decisions on new and underused vaccines. 
* Support successful country introduction and sustained use of new and underused vaccines.
* Contribute analyses and assess impact of GAVI Alliance (GAVI) policies that influence accelerated introduction of new and underused vaccines.
* Ensure sufficient supply of new and underused vaccines of assured quality and meeting  programmatic needs of developing countries.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The Accelerated Vaccine Initiative Technical Advisory Consortium (AVI TAC) supports the achievement of AVI objectives through its leadership in creating the evidence base, advocating for evidence-driven decision-making, and building platform capacity that can be used to accelerate the introduction of future vaccines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27348">'''Meatless Monday''' is an international campaign that encourages people to not eat meat on [[Monday]]s to improve their [[Meat#Health|health]] and the [[Environmental effects of meat production|health of the planet]].

Meatless Monday is a non-profit initiative of The Monday Campaigns Inc. in association with the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] [[Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future|Center for a Livable Future]]. Meatless Monday was founded in 2003 by marketing professional Sid Lerner. The program follows the nutrition guidelines developed by the USDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mypyramid.gov/ |title=United States Department of Agriculture - Home |publisher=MyPyramid.gov |date=2010-03-24 |accessdate=2010-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726014831/http://www.mypyramid.gov/ |archivedate=2007-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meatless Monday is part of the Healthy Monday initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthymonday.org/ |title=Healthy Monday |publisher=Healthy Monday |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy Monday encourages Americans to make healthier decisions at the start of every week. Other Healthy Monday campaigns include: The Kids Cook Monday, Monday 2000, Quit and Stay Quit Monday, Move it Monday, The Monday Mile, and others.

Meatless Monday focuses its initiative on Mondays for several reasons.  Friday is traditionally already a meat-free day among Catholics and Orthodox.  Monday is typically the beginning of the work week, the day when individuals settle back into their weekly routine. Habits that prevailed over the weekend can be forgotten and replaced by other choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mondaycampaigns.org/about/research/ |title= The Science behind The Monday Campaigns |website= The Monday Campaigns |quote= Health promotions at the beginning of the week have the potential to reduce negative health events. There’s a spike in heart problems, occupational injuries, strokes, suicides and referrals to secondary care on Monday, which researchers believe is caused by stress, unhealthy weekend behaviors and disruption of sleep cycles.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A weekly reminder to restart healthy habits also encourages success. A 2009 trial published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine provided individuals with weekly health prompts and encouragement. Approximately two thirds of participants responded with improvements in their overall health, eating habits and physical activity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/05/19/BA4917MKAP.DTL&amp;type=health |title=Trial: E-nagging can increase healthy activity |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=2010-05-05 | first=Victoria | last=Colliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During [[World War I]], President [[Woodrow Wilson]] issued a proclamation calling for every Tuesday to be meatless and for one meatless meal to be observed every day, for a total of nine meatless meals each week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Wilson |first= Woodrow |author-link= Woodrow Wilson |date= 1918-01-18 |title= President's Proclamation Calling Upon People of Nation to Reduce Consumption of Wheat and Meat Products in Order to Feed America's Associates in the War |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LW49AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PR10 |editor-last= Rochester |editor-first= Edward S. |newspaper= Official Bulletin |volume= 2 |issue= 219 |location= [[Washington, D.C.]] |publisher= United States [[Committee on Public Information]] |publication-date= 1918-01-28 |page= 3 |quote= In both homes and public eating places, in order to reduce the consumption of beef, pork, and sheep products, Tuesday should be observed as meatless day in each week, one meatless meal should be observed in each day, while, in addition, Saturday in each week should further be observed as a day upon which there should be no consumption of pork products.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Food Administration]] (USFA) urged families to reduce consumption of key staples to help the war effort and avoid rationing. Conserving food would support U.S. troops as well as feed populations in Europe where food production and distribution had been disrupted by war. To encourage voluntary rationing, the USFA created the slogan “Food Will Win the War” and coined the terms "Meatless Tuesday" and "Wheatless Wednesday” to remind Americans to reduce intake of those products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecommcode.com/hoover/hooveronline/hoover_bio/archive/food/wheat.htm |title=Wheatless Wednesdays |publisher=Hoover Museum - Digital Archives |date= |accessdate=December 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911213710/http://www.ecommcode.com/hoover/hooveronline/hoover_bio/archive/food/wheat.htm |archivedate=September 11, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Hoover]] was the head of the Food Administration as well as the American Relief Association during Woodrow Wilson's presidency, and played a key role implementing the campaign, which was one of Hoover’s many attempts to encourage volunteerism and sacrifice among Americans during the war. The USFA provided a wide variety of materials in addition to advertising, including recipe books and menus found in magazines, newspapers and government-sponsored pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;http://exhibits.mannlib.cornell.edu/meatlesswheatless/images/large/Foods%20That%20Will%20Win%20115.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign returned with the onset of [[World War II]], calling upon women on the home front to play a role in supporting the war effort. During this time, meat was being rationed, along with other commodities like sugar and gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1674.html |title=World War II Rationing |publisher=U-s-history.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harry Truman]] administration, through the Citizens Food Committee, encouraged "Meatless Tuesdays" and "Poultryless Thursdays" throughout the autumn of 1947; backlash was swift, noncompliance was rampant, and the poultry lobby responded with the [[National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation]], the forerunner of the modern "turkey pardon."&lt;ref&gt;https://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/23/the-way-we-ate-the-year-harry-truman-passed-on-pumpkin-pie/&lt;/ref&gt;

Meatless Monday was restarted in 2003 as a public health awareness program. The campaign was endorsed by the Center for a Livable Future (a division of the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]) as well as over 20 public health schools. In April 2009, Meatless Monday launched an informational video noting the [[effects of meat consumption on climate change]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Meatless Monday is based in the United States, but meatless days (Monday in particular) are gaining popularity worldwide. Meat-free Mondays exist in the United Kingdom both as an advertising campaign for Goodlife Foods and as an environmental campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodlife.co.uk/index.htm |title=Goodlife Vegetarian Foods: Home Page |publisher=Goodlife.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815113841/http://www.goodlife.co.uk/index.htm |archivedate=2009-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 15, 2009 [[Paul McCartney]] and his daughters Stella and Mary launched a Meat-free Monday campaign. In October 2009, Meatless Monday was launched in São Paulo with government support by the Brazilian Vegetarian Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.segundasemcarne.com.br/Segunda|title=Segunda Sem Carne agora é lei no DF|work=segundasemcarne.com.br|accessdate=31 August 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, Meatless Mondays launched in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meatlessmondays-australia.com |title=Meatless Mondays Australia |publisher=Meatless Mondays Australia |date=2010-04-26 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, the city of [[Ghent]], Belgium became the first city with 'official' weekly vegetarian days. Veggie Thursday (or "Donderdag Veggiedag” in Dutch) was created by the Ethical Vegetarian Alternative, an organization partially funded by the Flemish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegetarisme.be/ |title=Actueel â€˘ EVA, verleidelijk vegetarisch |publisher=Vegetarisme.be |date=2010-04-05 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli magazine ''Al Hashulchan'' (On the Table) introduced the Sheni Tzimchoni (Vegetarian Monday) initiative in June 2009. Dozens of Israel’s top restaurants will create innovative meatless meals on Mondays throughout July and August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hashulchan.co.il/Index.asp?ArticleID=12763&amp;CategoryID=346&amp;Page=1|title=על השולחן - בישול, אוכל, מתכונים|publisher=Hashulchan.co.il|date=|accessdate=2010-05-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201213610/http://www.hashulchan.co.il/Index.asp?ArticleID=12763&amp;CategoryID=346&amp;Page=1|archivedate=2009-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2010, San Francisco became the first US city to officially declare Mondays to be "meat free", calling it their Vegetarian Day. Several other countries have meat-free days as well, including Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meatlessmonday.ca |title=Meatless Monday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, the [[Government of Croatia]] also supported the initiative, excluding meat from the menu of the [[Ministry of Environment and Nature Protection]] on Mondays.

In 2017, the [[Casa Rosada]] of Argentina instituted, for one lunch of the day, meat-free Mondays, serving only vegan options to its approximately 500 employees, including President [[Mauricio Macri]].&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=A.L.|title=Argentina’s vegan Mondays|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/10/economist-explains-13|work=[[The Economist]]|date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==

An attempt by the Greens in Brighton, England, to initiate Meat-Free Mondays, thereby stopping the local council cafeteria selling any meat based foods, was halted after opposition from council workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9165595.Brighton_and_Hove_binmen_get____meat_free_Monday____the_chop/ |title=Brighton and Hove binmen get "meat-free Monday" the chop |publisher=Brighton Argus |date=2011-07-28 |accessdate=2011-09-03}},/&lt;/ref&gt;

*In his book ''[[In Defense of Food]]'', journalist [[Michael Pollan]] coined the phrase "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." He has since cited Meatless Monday as a way to reach this goal. So in April 2009 Pollan expressed the need for Americans to reduce meat consumption on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'': "even one meatless day a week—a Meatless Monday, which is what we do in our household—if everybody in America did that, that would be the equivalent of taking 20 million mid-size sedans off the road."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/article/oprahshow/20090422-tows-pollan-omnivore/2 |title=Michael Pollan - Omnivore's Dilemma - Environment and Food |publisher=Oprah.com |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6049">A '''nursing care bed''' (also '''nursing bed''' or '''care bed''') is a [[bed]] that has been adapted to the particular needs of people who are ill or disabled. Nursing care beds are used in private home care as well as in inpatient care (retirement and nursing homes).
== Construction and functionality of nursing care beds ==
Typical characteristics of nursing care beds include adjustable lying surfaces, adjustable heights up to at least 65 cm for ergonomic care, and lockable castors with a minimum diameter of 10 cm. Multi-sectioned, often electronically powered lying surfaces can be adjusted to fit a variety of positions, such as comfortable sitting positions, shock positions or cardiac positions. Nursing care beds are also often equipped with pull-up aids (trapeze bars) and/or [cot side|cot sides]] (side rails) to prevent falls.

Thanks to its adjustable height, the nursing care bed allows for both an ergonomic working height for nurses and healthcare therapists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/ergonomics/guidelines/nursinghome/final_nh_guidelines.html |title=Guidelines for Nursing Homes: Ergonomics for the Prevention of Musculoskeletal Disorders |publisher= U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA |access-date= July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a range of suitable positions allowing easy access for the resident. 
== Specifications for nursing care beds ==
The development, manufacture and sale of nursing care beds are subject to the following regulations:
*  ISO 14971 Medical devices. Risk analysis (see risk management)
*  IEC 60601-1 Medical electrical equipment 
*  IEC 60601-2-38
*  IEC 60601-2-52
*  93/42 EEC Directive medical devices
*  89/336 EEC Electromagnetic compatibility

== Special nursing care beds ==
; Bed-in-bed :
Bed-in-bed systems offer the option to retrofit the functionality of a nursing care bed into a conventional bed frame. A bed-in-bed system provides an electronically adjustable lying surface, which can be fitted into an existing bed frame replacing the conventional [[bed base | slatted frame]]. This enables the nursing care bed functionality to be fully integrated into the familiar bedroom furniture.
; Hospital bed :
[[hospital bed | Hospital beds]] provide all of the basic functions of a nursing care bed. However, [[hospital | hospitals]] have stricter requirements regarding hygiene as well as stability and longevity when it comes to beds. Hospital beds are also often equipped with special features (e.g. holders for IV devices, connections for intensive care, etc.).
; Lie-low bed :
This version of the nursing care bed allows the lying surface to be lowered close to the floor to prevent injury from falls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1= Huey-Ming | last1= Tzeng | first2= Chang-Yi | last2= Yin | title= Heights of occupied patient beds: a possible risk factor for inpatient falls | journal= Journal of Clinical Nursing | volume= 17|issue= 11| date= 2008 | pages= 1503-1509| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02086.x| url= https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/72643/1/j.1365-2702.2007.02086.x.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The lowest bed height in the sleeping position, usually about 25 cm above floor level, combined with a roll-down matt that can be placed at the side of the bed if needed – minimises the risk of injury if the resident falls out of the bed. Lie-low beds provide a viable alternative to conventional measures used in caring for restless residents by foregoing legally problematic restrictive measures (cot sides, fixation devices).
; Ultra-low bed / floor bed :
This is a further adaptation of the lie-low bed, with a lying surface that can be lowered to less than 10 cm above floor level, which ensures that the risk of injury is minimised if the resident falls out of the bed, even without a roll-down matt. In order to maintain and promote mobility, the particularly low height gives residents with limited motor ability the chance to independently return to bed by moving around on all fours, for example.

;Intelligent nursing care bed / smart bed :
Nursing care beds with technical equipment including sensors and notification functions are known as “intelligent” or “smart” beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cai|first=Hao|last2=Toft|first2=Egon|last3=Hejlesen|first3=Ole|last4=Hansen|first4=John|last5=Oestergaard|first5=Claus|last6=Dinesen|first6=Birthe|date=January 2015|title=HEALTH PROFESSIONALS’ USER EXPERIENCE OF THE INTELLIGENT BED IN PATIENTS’ HOMES|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-technology-assessment-in-health-care/article/health-professionals-user-experience-of-the-intelligent-bed-in-patients-homes/993EAAE5DB94F7D8F4149E4AAFCA0965|journal=International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care|volume=31|issue=4|pages=256–263|doi=10.1017/s0266462315000380|issn=0266-4623|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such sensors in intelligent nursing care beds can, for example, determine whether the user is in the bed, record the resident’s movement profile or register damp in the bed. Those measurements are transmitted to the care givers via cables or wirelessly. The beds are connected to alarm functions and help care givers to assess the need for action.&lt;br /&gt;Intelligent beds should contribute to improved care quality. For example, the documented sensor data regarding the intensity of movement in bed can help care givers recognise and make decisions about whether a resident should be moved to prevent bedsores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ajami|first=Sima|last2=Khaleghi|first2=Lida|title=A review on equipped hospital beds with wireless sensor networks for reducing bedsores|url=http://www.jmsjournal.net/text.asp?2015/20/10/1007/172797|journal=Journal of Research in Medical Sciences|volume=20|issue=10|doi=10.4103/1735-1995.172797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OSF HealthCare''' is a [[not-for-profit]] Catholic health care corporation that operates a medical group, hospital system, and other health care facilities in [[Illinois]] and [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="facts"/&gt;  Headquartered in [[Peoria, Illinois]], OSF HealthCare is owned and operated by the [[Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frost|first=Peter|title=Mayo makes another push into Illinois|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-04-19/business/chi-mayo-makes-another-push-into-ill-20130419_1_affiliation-health-care-overhaul-law-mayo-specialists|accessdate=2014-04-05|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Eczema ear2.jpg|thumb|A mild case of otitis externa.]]
[[File:OtitisExterna10.JPG|thumb|A severe case of acute otitis externa.  Note the narrowing of the ear channel, the large amounts of [[exudate]], and swelling of the [[Pinna (anatomy)|outer ear]].]]

[[Otalgia|Ear pain]] is the predominant complaint and the only symptom directly related to the severity of acute external otitis. Unlike other forms of ear infections, the pain of acute external otitis is worsened when the outer ear is touched or pulled gently. Pushing the [[Tragus (ear)|tragus]], the tablike portion of the [[Pinna (anatomy)|auricle]] that projects out just in front of the ear canal opening, also typically causes pain in this condition as to be diagnostic of external otitis on physical examination. People may also experience ear discharge and itchiness. When enough swelling and discharge in the ear canal is present to block the opening, external otitis may cause temporary conductive hearing loss.

Because the symptoms of external otitis lead many people to attempt to clean out the ear canal (or scratch it) with slim implements, self-cleaning attempts generally lead to additional traumas of the injured skin, so rapid worsening of the condition often occurs.

==Causes==
The two factors that are required for external otitis to develop are (1) the presence of [[Pathogen|germs]] that can infect the skin and (2) impairments in the integrity of the skin of the ear canal that allow an infection to occur. If the skin is healthy and uninjured, only exposure to a high concentration of pathogens, such as submersion in a pond contaminated by [[sewage]], is likely to set off an episode. However, if there are chronic skin conditions that affect the ear canal skin, such as [[atopic dermatitis]], [[seborrheic dermatitis]], [[psoriasis]] or abnormalities of [[keratin]] production, or if there has been a break in the skin from trauma, even the normal bacteria found in the ear canal may cause infection and full-blown symptoms of external otitis.&lt;ref&gt;Kang K, Stevens SR. Pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis. Clin Dermatol 2003;21:116–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fungal ear canal infections, also known as [[otomycosis]], range from inconsequential to extremely severe. Fungi can be [[saprophytic]], in which there are no symptoms and the fungus simply co-exists in the ear canal in a harmless parasitic relationship with the host, in which case the only physical finding is the presence of a fungus.  If the fungus begins active reproduction, the ear canal can fill with dense fungal debris, causing pressure and ever-increasing pain that is unrelenting until the fungus is removed from the canal and anti-fungal medication is used.  Most antibacterial ear drops also contain a steroid to hasten resolution of canal edema and pain.  Unfortunately, such drops make the fungal infection worse.  Prolonged use of them promotes the growth of fungus in the ear canal.  Antibacterial ear drops should be used a maximum of one week, but 5 days is usually enough.  Otomycosis responds more than 95% of the time to a three-day course of the same over-the-counter anti-fungal solutions used
for athlete's foot.

=== Swimming ===
[[Human swimming|Swimming]] in polluted water is a common way to contract swimmer's ear, but it is also possible to contract swimmer's ear from water trapped in the ear canal after a shower, especially in a humid climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang MC, Liu CY, Shiao AS, Wang T |title=Ear problems in swimmers |journal=J Chin Med Assoc |volume=68 |issue=8 |pages=347–52 |date=August 2005 |pmid=16138712 |doi= 10.1016/S1726-4901(09)70174-1|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Constriction of the ear canal from bone growth ([[Surfer's ear]]) can trap debris leading to infection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ent.uci.edu/surfer%27s%20ear.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717170308/http://www.ent.uci.edu/surfer%27s%20ear.htm |date=July 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saturation diving|Saturation divers]] have reported Otitis externa during occupational exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cobet AB, Wright DN, Warren PI |title=Tektite-I program: bacteriological aspects |journal=Aerosp Med |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=611–6 |date=June 1970 |pmid=4392833 |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahlén C, Mandal LH, Iversen OJ |title=Identification of infectious Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in an occupational saturation diving environment |journal=Occup Environ Med |volume=55 |issue=7|pages=480–4 |date=July 1998 |pmid=9816382 |pmc=1757612 |doi= 10.1136/oem.55.7.480|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thalmann, ED |title=A Prophylactic Program for the Prevention of Otitis Externa in Saturation Divers |journal=[[United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit]] Technical Report |volume=NEDU-RR-10-74 |year=1974 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3372 |accessdate=2008-07-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820002740/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3372 |archivedate=2008-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objects in ear ===
Even without exposure to water, the use of objects such as [[cotton swab]]s or other small objects to clear the ear canal is enough to cause breaks in the skin, and allow the condition to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zichichi L, Asta G, Noto G |title=Pseudomonas aeruginosa folliculitis after shower/bath exposure |journal=Int. J. Dermatol. |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=270–3 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10809975 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-4362.2000.00931.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0011-9059&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=39&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=270 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the skin of the ear canal is inflamed, external otitis can be drastically enhanced by either scratching the ear canal with an object, or by allowing water to remain in the ear canal for any prolonged length of time.

===Infections===
The majority of cases are due to ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa|journal = Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|date = 2006-04-01|issn = 0194-5998|pmid = 16638473|pages = S4-23|volume = 134|issue = 4 Suppl|doi = 10.1016/j.otohns.2006.02.014|first = Richard M.|last = Rosenfeld|first2 = Lance|last2 = Brown|first3 = C.

==Diagnosis==
When the ear is inspected, the canal appears red and swollen in well developed cases. The ear canal may also appear [[eczema]]-like, with scaly shedding of skin. Touching or moving the outer ear increases the pain, and this maneuver on physical exam is important in establishing the clinical diagnosis. It may be difficult to see the [[eardrum]] with an [[otoscope]] at the initial examination because of narrowing of the ear canal from inflammation and the presence of drainage and debris. Sometimes the diagnosis of external otitis is presumptive and return visits are required to fully examine the ear. The culture of the drainage may identify the bacteria or fungus causing infection, but is not part of the routine diagnostic evaluation. In severe cases of external otitis, there may be swelling of the [[lymph node]](s) directly beneath the ear.

The diagnosis may be missed in most early cases because the examination of the ear, with the exception of pain with manipulation, is nearly normal. In some early cases, the most striking visual finding is the lack of [[cerumen|earwax]]. As a moderate or severe case of external otitis resolves, weeks may be required before the ear canal again shows a normal amount of it.

=== Classification ===
In contrast to the chronic otitis externa, acute otitis externa (AOE) is predominantly a bacterial infection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenfeld|first=R. M.|author2=Schwartz, S. R. |author3=Cannon, C. R. |author4=Roland, P. S. |author5=Simon, G. R. |author6=Kumar, K. A. |author7=Huang, W. W. |author8=Haskell, H. W. |author9= Robertson, P. J.  |title=Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa Executive Summary|journal=Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|date=3 February 2014|volume=150|issue=2|pages=161–168|doi=10.1177/0194599813517659}}&lt;/ref&gt; occurs suddenly, rapidly worsens, and becomes painful.  The ear canal has an abundant nerve supply, so the pain is often severe enough to interfere with sleep.  [[Cerumen|Wax]] in the ear can combine with the swelling of the canal skin and the associated pus to block the canal and dampen hearing, creating a temporary [[conductive hearing loss]]. In more severe or untreated cases, the infection can spread to the soft tissues of the face that surround the adjacent [[parotid gland]] and the [[Temporomandibular joint|jaw joint]], making chewing painful. In its mildest forms, otitis externa is so common that some [[Otolaryngologist|ear nose and throat physicians]] have suggested that most people will have at least a brief episode at some point in life. While a small percentage of people seem to have an innate tendency toward chronic otitis externa, most people can avoid otitis externa altogether once they understand the intricate mechanisms of the disease.

The skin of the bony ear canal is unique, in that it is not movable but is closely attached to the bone, and it is almost paper thin. For these reasons, it is easily abraded or torn by even minimal physical force. Inflammation of the ear canal skin typically begins with a physical insult, most often from injury caused by attempts at self-cleaning or scratching with cotton swabs, pen caps, fingernails, hair pins, keys, or other small implements. Another causative factor for acute infection is prolonged water exposure in the forms of swimming or exposure to extreme humidity, which can compromise the protective barrier function of the canal skin, allowing bacteria to flourish, hence the name "swimmer's ear".

==Prevention==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
The strategies for preventing acute external otitis are similar to those for treatment. 
* Avoid inserting ''anything'' into the ear canal: use of cotton buds or swabs is the most common event leading to acute otitis externa.
* Most normal ear canals have a self-cleaning and self-drying mechanism, the latter by simple evaporation.
* After prolonged swimming, a person prone to external otitis can dry the ears using a small battery-powered ear dryer, available at many retailers, especially shops catering to watersports enthusiasts.  Alternatively, drops containing dilute acetic acid (vinegar diluted 3:1) or [[Burow's solution]] may be used.  It is especially important NOT to instrument ears when the skin is saturated with water, as it is very susceptible to injury, which can lead to external otitis.
* Avoid swimming in polluted water.
* Avoid washing hair or swimming if very mild symptoms of acute external otitis begin
* Although the use of [[earplugs]] when swimming and shampooing hair may help prevent external otitis, there are important details in the use of plugs. Hard and poorly fitting ear plugs can scratch the ear canal skin and set off an episode. When earplugs are used during an acute episode, either disposable plugs are recommended, or used plugs must be cleaned and dried properly to avoid contaminating the healing ear canal with infected discharge.

==Treatment==

===Medications===
Effective solutions for the ear canal include acidifying and drying agents, used either singly or in combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Doc Vikingo|title=Swimmers Ear – Additional Advice About A Pesky and Sometimes Painful Problem|journal=Diver's Alert Network: Alert Diver Magazine|volume=|issue=|pages=|date=March–April 2007|pmid=|doi=|url=http://www.awoosh.com/DocVikingo/Preventing_Swimmers_Ear.htm|accessdate=2008-07-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612005441/http://www.awoosh.com/DocVikingo/Preventing_Swimmers_Ear.htm|archivedate=2008-06-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ear canal skin is inflamed from the acute otitis externa, the use of dilute [[acetic acid]] may be painful.

[[Burow's solution]] is a very effective remedy against both bacterial and fungal external otitis. This is a buffered mixture of [[aluminum sulfate]] and [[acetic acid]], and is available without prescription in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Kashiwamura M. Chida E. Matsumura M. Nakamaru Y. Suda N. Terayama Y. Fukuda S. The efficacy of Burow's solution as an ear preparation for the treatment of chronic ear infections. [Clinical Trial. Journal Article] Otology &amp; Neurotology. 25(1):9–13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Ear drops are the mainstays of treatment for external otitis.  Some contain antibiotics, either antibacterial or antifungal, and others are simply designed to mildly acidify the ear canal environment to discourage bacterial growth. Some prescription drops also contain anti-inflammatory steroids, which help to resolve swelling and itching.  Although there is evidence that steroids are effective at reducing the length of treatment time required, fungal otitis externa (also called otomycosis) may be caused or aggravated by overly prolonged use of steroid-containing drops.

Antibiotics by mouth should not be used to treat uncomplicated acute otitis externa.&lt;ref name="AANfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery |author1-link = American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery |date = February 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery]] |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page =  |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-academy-of-otolaryngology-head-and-neck-surgery-foundation/ |accessdate = August 1, 2013 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130901115441/http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-academy-of-otolaryngology-head-and-neck-surgery-foundation/ |archivedate = September 1, 2013 |df =  }}, which cites

Although the acute external otitis generally resolves in a few days with topical washes and antibiotics, complete return of hearing and cerumen gland function may take a few more days. Once healed completely, the ear canal is again self-cleaning. Until it recovers fully, it may be more prone to repeat infection from further physical or chemical insult.

Effective medications include [[ear drop]]s containing [[antibiotic]]s to fight infection, and [[corticosteroid]]s to reduce itching and inflammation. In painful cases a topical solution of antibiotics such as aminoglycoside, polymyxin or fluoroquinolone is usually prescribed.  Antifungal solutions are used in the case of fungal infections.  External otitis is almost always predominantly bacterial or predominantly fungal, so that only one type of medication is necessary and indicated.

===Cleaning===
Removal of debris (wax, shed skin, and pus) from the ear canal promotes direct contact of the prescribed medication with the infected skin and shortens recovery time. When canal swelling has progressed to the point where the ear canal is blocked, topical drops may not penetrate far enough into the ear canal to be effective.  The physician may need to carefully insert a wick of cotton or other commercially available, pre-fashioned, absorbent material called an ear wick and then saturate that with the medication.  The wick is kept saturated with medication until the canal opens enough that the drops will penetrate the canal without it.  Removal of the wick does not require a health professional. Antibiotic ear drops should be dosed in a quantity that allows coating of most of the ear canal and used for no more than 4 to 7 days.  The ear should be left open.  It is imperative that visualization of an intact [[tympanic membrane]] (eardrum) is noted. 
Use of certain medications with a ruptured tympanic membrane can cause [[tinnitus]], [[vertigo]], dizziness and hearing loss in some cases.

==Prognosis==
Otitis externa responds well to treatment, but complications may occur if it is not treated. Individuals with underlying [[diabetes]], disorders of the immune system, or history of [[radiation therapy]] to the base of the skull are more likely to develop complications, including malignant otitis externa.&lt;ref name="pmid23111934"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saxby A, Barakate M, Kertesz T, James J, Bennett M |title=Malignant otitis externa: experience with hyperbaric oxygen therapy |journal=Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=195–200 |date=December 2010 |pmid=23111934 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/10225 |accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these individuals, rapid examination by an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat physician) is very important.

==={{Visible anchor|Necrotizing}} external otitis===
Necrotizing external otitis (malignant otitis externa) is an uncommon form of external otitis that occurs mainly in elderly diabetics, being somewhat more likely and more severe when the diabetes is poorly controlled. Even less commonly, it can develop due to a severely compromised immune system. Beginning as infection of the external ear canal, there is an extension of the infection into the bony ear canal and the soft tissues deep to the bony canal. Unrecognized and untreated, it may result in death. The hallmark of malignant otitis externa (MOE) is unrelenting pain that interferes with sleep and persists even after swelling of the external ear canal may have resolved with topical antibiotic treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid23111934"/&gt;  It can also cause skull base osteomyelitis (SBO), manifested by multiple cranial nerve palsies, described below under the "Treatment" heading.

====Natural history====
MOE follows a much more chronic and [[Indolent condition|indolent]] course than ordinary acute otitis externa. There may be granulation involving the floor of the external ear canal, most often at the bony-cartilaginous junction.  Paradoxically, the physical findings of MOE, at least in its early stages, are often much less dramatic than those of ordinary acute otitis externa. In later stages, there can be soft tissue swelling around the ear, even in the absence of significant canal swelling. While fever and [[leukocytosis]] might be expected in response to bacterial infection invading the skull region, MOE does not cause fever or elevation of white blood count.

====Treatment of MOE====
Unlike ordinary otitis externa, MOE requires oral or intravenous antibiotics for cure. Pseudomonas is the most common offending pathogen.  Diabetes control is also an essential part of treatment.  When MOE goes unrecognized and untreated, the infection continues to smolder and over weeks or months can spread deeper into the head and involve the bones of the skull base, constituting skull base osteomyelitis &lt;nowiki&gt;(SBO)&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Multiple cranial nerve palsies can result, including the facial nerve (causing facial palsy), the recurrent laryngeal nerve (causing vocal cord paralysis) {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}, and the cochlear nerve (causing deafness). The infecting organism is almost always pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it can instead be fungal (aspergillus or mucor). MOE and SBO are not amenable to surgery, but exploratory surgery may facilitate the culture of unusual organism(s) that are not responding to empirically used anti-pseudomonal antibiotics ([[ciprofloxacin]] being the drug of choice).  The usual surgical finding is diffuse cellulitis without localized abscess formation.  SBO can extend into the petrous apex of the temporal bone or more inferiorly into the opposite side of the skull base.

The use of [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy remains controversial.&lt;ref name="pmid23111934"/&gt;

====Complications====
As the skull base is progressively involved, the adjacent exiting cranial nerves and their branches, especially the [[facial nerve]] and the [[vagus nerve]], may be affected, resulting in facial paralysis and hoarseness, respectively. If both of the [[recurrent laryngeal nerves]] are paralyzed, shortness of breath may develop and necessitate tracheotomy. Profound deafness can occur, usually later in the disease course due to relative resistance of the inner ear structures.  Gallium scans are sometimes used to document the extent of the infection but are not essential to disease management. Skull base [[osteomyelitis]] is a chronic disease that can require months of IV antibiotic treatment, tends to recur, and has a significant mortality rate.&lt;ref name="pmid23111934"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of otitis externa is high. In the Netherlands, it has been estimated at 12–14 per 1000 population per year, and has been shown to affect more than 1% of a sample of the population in the United Kingdom over a 12-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Balen F, Smit W, Zuithoff N, Verheij T | title = Clinical efficacy of three common treatments in acute otitis externa in primary care: randomised controlled trial | journal = BMJ | volume = 327 | issue = 7425 | pages = 1201–5 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14630756 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.327.7425.1201 | pmc = 274056}}''[http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/327/7425/1201 Full text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310095145/http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/327/7425/1201 |date=2006-03-10 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the [[Tektite habitat|Tektite Project]] in 1969 there was a great deal of otitis externa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ray |first1=Edward |last2=Cohen |first2=Robert |title="Tektite": A Blueprint for Cooperative Undersea Scientific Program |journal=Journal of the Atomic Scientists |volume=XXIV |issue=2 |pages=35–40 |date=February 1970 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAcAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=tektite+program+report+ear+infection&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6aKAO1Pmz4&amp;sig=UaKol5zcqYSXEdRbXlZSOk8wf2M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gXpdT620Ao7OiAKx68DXCw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=ear%20infection&amp;f=false |accessdate=2012-11-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215012630/https://books.google.com/books?id=pAcAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=tektite+program+report+ear+infection&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6aKAO1Pmz4&amp;sig=UaKol5zcqYSXEdRbXlZSOk8wf2M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gXpdT620Ao7OiAKx68DXCw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=ear%20infection&amp;f=false |archivedate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Diving Medical Officer devised a prophylaxis that came to be known as, "Tektite Solution", equal parts of 15% tannic acid, 15% acetic acid and 50% isopropanol or ethanol. During Tektite ethanol was used because it was available in the lab for pickling specimens.

'''Plutarco Naranjo Vargas''' ([[Ambato, Ecuador|Ambato]], June 18, 1921 - April 27, 2012) was a doctor, teacher, journalist, historian, and scientific researcher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegrafo.com.ec/opinion/columnistas/item/plutarco-naranjo-vargas-ecuatoriano-ejemplar.html Plutarco Naranjo Vargas, ecuatoriano ejemplar]&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the Ecuadorian ambassador to the [[Soviet Union]], [[Poland]], and the [[German Democratic Republic]] (concurrently) from 1977 to 1978. In 1988, he accepted a four-year appointment to the cabinet of newly elected president [[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos]] as Minister of Health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academianacionaldehistoria.org.ec/images/descargas/jorgenunez/librohomenajeaplutarconaranjo.pdf Homenaje de la Academia Nacional de Historia al Dr. Plutarco Naranjo Vargas]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Academy, Dr. Plutarco Naranjo was one of the trainers through generations of doctors in Ecuador, he participated as organizer of Pharmacology Chair and advised to the Physiology Department of Valey University (Cali-Colombia), besides, he founded the Pharmacology Chair at Central University of Ecuador.

Since his youth, he was strong involved in Botany, that allowed him to open the possibility of  knowledge interchange between the western knowledge of botany and traditional medicine, the sacred uses of plants and myths and cultures, creating big contributions to Ethnomedicine.

His research were very important in Pharmacology, which contributed to improve the life quality, from the field of health to a wide population of patients with various pathologies, in the same way, he made several researches about immunological mechanisms, hypersensitivity to drugs and foods, allergies to antibiotics, and more.

He was a founder of the [[Ecuadorian Academy of Medicine]] and became its president. He was also president of the [[SILAE - Italo Latin American Association of Ethnomedicine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silae.it/eng/consigliodirettivo SILAE - Italo Latin American Association of Ethnomedicine]&lt;/ref&gt; from 1995 to 1997. He was also the Academic Director in the field of health at the [[Simón Bolívar Andean University]].

He was married to Dr. [[Enriqueta Banda Flores]]. They had three children: Alexis, Ana and Plutarco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/fallecio-en-quito-el-doctor-plutarco-naranjo-vargas-544665.html Falleció en Quito el doctor Plutarco Naranjo Vargas]&lt;/ref&gt;

He received the [[Premio Eugenio Espejo|Eugenio Espejo National Award]] in 1986 in the field of science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cncultura.gob.ec/index.php/premio-eugenio-espejo/ganadores-biografias Ganadores (Biografias)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193137/http://www.cncultura.gob.ec/index.php/premio-eugenio-espejo/ganadores-biografias |date=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140619234839/http://cncultura.gob.ec/index.php/premio-eugenio-espejo/ganadores-biografias]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Quito on April 27, 2012.

==Awards==

==="''Pfiesteria'' hysteria"===
The prominent and exaggerating media coverage of ''Pfiesteria'' as carnivorous algae attacking fish and humans has been implicated in causing "''Pfiesteria'' hysteria" in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in 1997 resulting in an apparent outbreak of human illness in the [[Pocomoke River|Pocomoke]] region in [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name="JoE"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Terlizzi DE |title=Pfiesteria Hysteria, Agriculture, and Water Quality in the Chesapeake Bay: The Extension Bridge over Troubled Waters |journal=Journal of Extension |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=5FEA3 |year=2006 |pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.joe.org/joe/2006october/a3.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study published the following year concluded the symptoms were unlikely to be caused by [[mass hysteria]].&lt;ref name="pmid9601200"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenberg DR, Tracy JK, Grattan LM |title=A critical review of the Pfiesteria hysteria hypothesis |journal=Md Med J |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=133–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9601200 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==

During the media coverage in the 1990s, ''Pfiesteria'' has been referred to as "super villain"&lt;ref name="discovermagazine"/&gt; and subsequently has been used as such in several fictional works. A ''Pfiesteria'' subspecies killing humans featured in [[James Powlik]]'s 1999 environmental thriller ''[[Sea Change (Powlik novel)|Sea Change]]''. In [[Frank Schätzing]]'s 2004 [[science fiction]] novel [[The Swarm (Schätzing novel)|The Swarm]], [[lobster]]s and [[crab]]s spread the killer alga ''Pfiesteria homicida'' to humans.

In [[Yann Martel]]'s 2001 novel ''[[Life of Pi]]'', the protagonist encounters a floating island of carnivorous algae inhabited by [[meerkat]]s while shipwrecked in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. At a book reading in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], [[Canada]], Martel explained that the carnivorous algae island had the purpose of representing the more fantastical of two competing stories in his novel and challenge the reader to a "leap of faith."&lt;ref name="FFWD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/2003/1120/book1.htm |title=FFWD Weekly - November 20, 2003 |accessdate=2008-01-05 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202180618/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/2003/1120/book1.htm |archivedate=2008-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2005 [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] TV show ''[[Aurelia and Blue Moon|Extraterrestrial]]'', the alien organism termed ''Hysteria'' combines characteristics of ''Pfiesteria'' with those of [[Dictyostelid|cellular slime molds]]. Like ''Pfiesteria'', ''Hysteria'' is a unicellular, microscopic predator capable of producing a paralytic toxin. Like cellular slime molds, it can release chemical stress signals that cause the cells to aggregate into a [[swarm]] which allows the newly formed superorganism to feed on much larger animals and produce a fruiting body that releases [[spore]]s for reproduction.&lt;ref name="EXTRATERRESTRIAL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/extraterrestrial/ |title=National Geographic Channel: EXTRATERRESTRIAL |accessdate=2008-01-05 |format= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212122944/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/extraterrestrial/ |archivedate=2007-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8496">'''Preimplantation genetic haplotyping''' ('''PGH''') is a clinical method of [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) used to determine the presence of single gene disorders in offspring. PGH provides a more feasible method of gene location than whole-genome association experiments, which are expensive and time-consuming.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/10001665|title=Developing a Haplotype Map of the Human Genome to Find Genes Related to Health and Disease: Meeting Summary|website=www.genome.gov|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PGH differs from common PGD methods such as [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|fluorescence ''in situ'' hybridization]] (FISH) and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) for two primary reasons.  First, rather than focusing on the genetic makeup of an [[embryo]] PGH compares the genome of affected and unaffected members of previous generations. This examination of generational variation then allows for a [[haplotype]] of genetic markers statistically associated with the target disease to be identified, rather than searching merely for a mutation. PGH is often used to reinforce other methods of genetic testing, and is considered more accurate than certain more common PGD methods because it has been found to reduce risk of misdiagnoses. Studies have found that misdiagnoses due to [[Amplified fragment length polymorphism|allele dropout]] (ADO), one of the most common causes of interpretation error, can be almost entirely eliminated through use of PGH.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Coskun S, Qubbaj W. 2010. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis and selection. J. Reprod Stem Cell Biotechnol 1(1): 120-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in the case of mutation due to translocation, PGH is able to detect chromosome abnormality to its full extent by differentiating between embryos carrying balanced forms of a [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] versus those carrying the homologous normal [[chromosome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Shamash J, Rienstein S, Wolf-Reznik H, Pras E, Dekel M, Litmanovitch T, Brengauz M, Goldman B, Yonath H, Dor J, Levron J, Aviram-Goldring A. Preimplantation genetic haplotyping a new application for diagnosis of translocation carrier’s embryos- preliminary observations of two robertsonian translocation carrier families. J Assist Reprod Genet (2011) 28:77–83.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an advantage because PGD methods such as FISH are able to reveal whether an embryo will express the phenotypic difference, but not whether an embryo may be a carrier.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Altarescu G, Zeevi DA, Zeligson S, Perlberg S, Eldar-Geva T, Margalioth EJ, Levy-Lahad E, Renbaum P. Familial haplotyping and embryo analysis for Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) microarrays: a proof of principle study. J Assist Reprod Genet (2013) 30:1595–1603.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, PGH was used in conjunction with a whole-genome amplification (WGA) process to not only diagnose disease but also distinguish meiotic segregation errors from mitotic ones.&lt;ref&gt;NewsRx. 2015. Genetics; Studies from Sanger Institute in the Area of Human Genetics Reported (Concurrent Whole-Genome Haplotyping and Copy-Number Profiling of Single Cells). Atlanta (GA): Life Science Weekly.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies are being continually performed in an attempt to utilize and improve PGD methods since their initial invention. It has become increasingly popular because it grants individuals the option of detecting embryo abnormalities before implantation, rather than during the beginning weeks of pregnancy. The latter often results in embryo abortion, presenting an ethical dilemma for many that can now be avoided.

== Procedure ==
PGH uses information regarding family history in conjunction with the use of linked polymorphic markers such as [[short tandem repeats]] (STRs) and [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) to locate genes responsible for disease. Both STRs and SNPs are variations in gene nucleotides, and it is estimated that there are tens of millions of each type of variation in human DNA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; High frequency of STRs or SNPs in alleles of affected individuals in comparison to their unaffected direct relatives indicates the origin of a disease causing mutation. They thus "mark"  alleles as having a mutation without having to specifically identify the mutation. Because the number of potential STRs and SNPs is so high, a family pedigree helps to narrow the scope of alleles to analyze.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Further, understanding how the gene of interest gets expressed over time helps ultimately determine which haplotype is responsible for the alleles linked to the mutation. A haplotype map is thus created, not only exhibiting genes the offspring will contain, but also the parental origin of the genes. Once the alleles that correlate with a mutation are characterized, PGH of the embryos is possible and only embryos carrying the low risk haplotypes are selected for transfer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; PGH is performed [[in vitro]] until this point, when the chosen embryos get placed in the uterus of a surrogate mother for further development.

== Advantages ==
Once a panel of associated genetic markers has been established for a particular disease it can be used for all carriers of that disease.&lt;ref name="Renwick"&gt;{{cite journal|last4=Fassihi|first4=Hiva|last5=Black|first5=Cheryl|last6=Braude|first6=Peter|last7=Ogilvie|first7=Caroline Mackie|last8=Abbs|first8=Stephen|date=2006-07-13|title=Proof of principle and first cases using preimplantation genetic haplotyping--a paradigm shift for embryo diagnosis|url=http://www.rbmojournal.com/article/S1472-6483(10)62024-X/abstract|subscription=yes|journal=Reprod Biomed Online|volume=13|issue=1|pages=110–9|doi=10.1016/S1472-6483(10)62024-X|pmid=16820122|author=Renwick PJ|name-list-format=vanc|author2=Trussler J|author3=Ostad-Saffari E|display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, since even a monogenic disease can be caused by many different mutations within the affected gene, conventional PGD methods based on finding a specific mutation would require mutation-specific tests. Thus, PGH widens the availability of PGD to cases where mutation-specific tests are unavailable.

PGH also has an advantage over [[fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH) in that FISH is not usually able to make the differentiation between embryos that possess the balanced form of a [[chromosomal translocation]] and those carrying the homologous normal chromosomes. This inability can be seriously harmful to the diagnosis made. PGH can make the distinction that FISH often cannot. PGH does this by using polymorphic markers that are better suited at recognizing translocations. These polymorphic markers are able to distinguish between embryos that carried normal, balanced, and unbalanced translocations. FISH also requires more cell fixation for analysis whereas PGH requires only transfer of cells into polymerase chain reaction tubes. The cell transfer is a simpler method and leaves less room for analysis failure.&lt;ref&gt;Shamash, J. et al. (2011). Preimplantation genetic haplotyping a new application for diagnosis of translocation carrier’s embryos – preliminary observations of two robertsonian trans-location carrier families. Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics, 28(1), 77-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

PGH has been used to screen for:
* [[Cystic fibrosis]]&lt;ref name=Renwick/&gt;
* [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]]
* [[Huntington's disease]]
* [[Spinal muscular atrophy]]
* [[Alport's syndrome]]
* [[Von Hippel–Lindau disease]]
* [[Sickle-cell disease]]
* [[Hydatidiform mole]]

==History==
While PGD was initially carried out to sex rabbits in 1968, human PGD only became available after the development of PCR on a single cell DNA in 1985.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; PGH was first developed in 2006 at [[London]]'s [[Guy's Hospital]].&lt;ref name=Renwick/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2631">This article is about the social and economic effects of [[rabies]] disease in [[Tanzania]].

==Context==
{{main article|Rabies}}
Rabies is a fatal, preventable [[zoonosis]] that infects the [[central nervous system]] of [[mammals]], caused by the [[lyssavirus]].&lt;ref&gt;US National Library of Medicine; National Institute of Health website,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322764/&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[endemic]] in low income countries, causing an estimated 55,000 human deaths each year with over 98% of these deaths following bites from rabid dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Sambo, M., Cleaveland, S., Ferguson, H., Lembo, T., Simon, C., Urassa, H., &amp; Hampson, K. (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a dangerous disease, if it is not effectively controlled. Many of the developing world arguing that the efforts for control is hampered by lack of awareness of its true impact.

==Socio-economic effects==
Research conducted in Tanzania estimated human rabies mortality at 1499 deaths per year, including unreported cases. There were only 193 reported cases, or 12% of the true number of people dying of rabies annually.&lt;ref&gt;Cleaveland, S., Fe, E. M., Kaare, M., &amp; Coleman, P. G. (2002). Estimating human rabies mortality in the United Republic of Tanzania from dog bite injuries. Sci ELO, Public Health, 80(1).&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2017}}

Rabies takes an economic toll on Tanzania; costs due to rabies include medical expenses, control of infected dogs, and safety inspections in local communities. Rabies medication is also very expensive for the average Tanzanian.&lt;ref&gt;Knobel, D. L., Cleaveland, S., Coleman, P. G., Fèvre, E. M., Meltzer, M. I., Miranda, M. E. G., … Meslin, F. (2005). Re-evaluating the burden of rabies in Africa and Asia. Sci ELO, Public Health, 8862(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention schemes==
There have been some efforts to control rabies through vaccination of the disease sources, which include dogs and other wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, M. C., Hampson, K., Cleaveland, S., Meyers, L. A., Townsend, J. P., &amp; Galvani, A. P. (2012). Potential for Rabies Control through Dog Vaccination in Wildlife-Abundant Communities of Tanzania, 6(8), 6–11. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0001796&lt;/ref&gt; A study done in two districts of [[Ngorongoro]] and [[Serengeti]] studied the spread pattern of rabies where wildlife plays a role in disease transmission. Findings indicated that an annual dog [[vaccination]] campaign, achieving the [[WHO]]-recommended target of 70% coverage, would have a high chance of controlling rabies in [[Ngorongoro]] and [[Serengeti]].

'''Regulation of tobacco by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration''' began in 2009 with the passage of the [[Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act]] by the [[United States Congress]]. With this statute, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) was given the ability to regulate [[tobacco]] products.

==FDA regulation==
[[File:Verkaufsalter für Tabakwaren in Nordamerika (im Jahr 1989).svg|thumb|right|350px|'''Minimum age to purchase tobacco in the [[United States]] as of 1989:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=zslh0030 |title=STATE "MINIMUM AGE" lAWS E_ _D 1989-1994 |author= |date= |website=industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu |page= |publisher=Legacy Tobacco Documents |access-date=2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;{{legend|#B200FF|Minimum age is 19}}{{legend|#0026FF|Minimum age is 18}}{{legend|#00FFFF|Minimum age is 17}}{{legend|#267F00|Minimum age is 16}}{{legend|#C0C0C0|No minimum age}}]]

Prior to 1996, the FDA played no role in the regulation of tobacco products, and regulations were controlled through a combination of state and congressional regulation. Most state laws dealt with the sale of tobacco products, including the issue of selling to minors and licensing of distributors. By 1950, most states had laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors, which at the time, the purchase age differed in each state. In 1992 the federal government required states to set a minimum age of at least 18 years to purchase tobacco products, which was amended in all states by 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=gmmy0090 |title=IN OPPOSITION TO EFFORTS TO RAISE THE MINIMUM PURCHASE AGE FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS; N838 |author=Unknown |date=1997-10-06 |language=en |website=industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu |page= |publisher=Philip Morris |access-date=2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[Luther Terry]] issued a report on smoking and health saying that tobacco causes lung cancer and is a main contributor to [[bronchitis]]. Members of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] read the report the day it was released and quickly proposed a mandatory cigarette label that warned, "CAUTION: cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health and may cause death from cancer and other diseases." However, legislation ultimately passed by Congress required a warning label with less dire language:"CAUTION: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH."&lt;ref&gt;[[Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hoofnagle |first1= Chris Jay |author-link1= Chris Hoofnagle | title = Federal Trade Commission Privacy Law and Policy |year= 2016 |orig-year= |chapter= The 1964 Surgeon General’s Report on Smoking and the Cigarette Rule |publisher= Cambridge University Press |publication-date= 2016 |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/competition-law/federal-trade-commission-law-and-policy?format=PB |isbn= 9781107126787}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act|Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act]] (FCLAA), which required a health warning on all cigarette packs. In 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] signed the [[Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act]], which banned cigarettes ads on the radio or television. It also required an updated warning on the cigarette packages which read: "Warning: The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health."

In 1996, the FDA issued the "FDA Rule," which asserted its authority over tobacco products and issued a rule intending to prevent and reduce tobacco use by children. The intended regulations included prohibiting non-face-to-face sales of tobacco products, prohibiting outdoor advertising of tobacco products near schools or playgrounds, imposing more stringent advertising regulations, and prohibiting brand-name sponsorship, among other things.

After the regulations were issued in 1996, tobacco companies sued. In the 2000 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.]]'', the court ruled that Congress had not given the FDA authority over tobacco and tobacco marketing.

As a result, Congress was forced to provide explicit FDA authority to regulate tobacco and this was finally accomplished via the passage of the [[Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act]] in 2010.

==Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act==
The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (also known as the FSPTC Act) was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on June 22, 2009. This bill changed the scope of tobacco policy in the United States by giving the FDA the ability to regulate tobacco products, similar to how it has regulated food and pharmaceuticals since the passing of the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] in 1906.

President [[Barack Obama]], who has himself struggled with smoking addiction, praised the law, saying that it will save American lives. The Obama administration had previously voiced support for such an act, while former President [[George W. Bush]] had threatened to veto the law after it had passed the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2008.  Much opposition to the law from Congress came from tobacco-growing states such as [[North Carolina]], whose representatives said they felt that the FDA was not fit to take on the large task of regulating tobacco products.

The act gives the FDA comprehensive control on tobacco products for sale in the United States. Much of the legislation is targeted specifically at [[cigarettes]] and/or [[smokeless tobacco]] products. The act gives the FDA the power to:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tobacco Control Act|url = http://www.fda.gov/tobaccoproducts/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/ucm246129.htm|website = www.fda.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Require tobacco companies to submit an ingredients list of any product sold or imported in the United States
* Require tobacco companies to make public the nicotine content of their products and to adopt standards of nicotine content and to reduce or eliminate other harmful substances present
* Enlarge warnings on tobacco packaging so that they take up 50% of the front and back panel area
* Regulate the use of terms such as "mild" and "light" by requiring that tobacco products conform to certain standards regarding these terms
* Create a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee to help inform the FDA on issues relating to tobacco products

==Center for Tobacco Products==
The [[Center for Tobacco Products]] (CTP) is the branch of the FDA created in response to and for the implementation of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The FDA currently has eight divisions, each of which is responsible for protecting some aspect of the public health. The main duties of the Center for Tobacco control include:
* Set performance standards
* Review applications for new tobacco products (see [[premarket tobacco application]]) and modified-risk claims (see [[modified risk tobacco product]]s) before they reach the market
* Require and control [[warning label]]s
* Establish and enforce advertising restrictions

The Center for Tobacco Products is the newest branch of the FDA, and officially was opened on August 19, 2009. Lawrence Deyton, M.D., M.S.P.H, was appointed the first director of the center. Mitch Zeller, JD, became the Director of CTP in March 2013. Zeller was the associate commissioner and director of FDA's first Office of Tobacco Programs until 2000, when the Supreme Court decided that Congress did not give the FDA authority over tobacco products and tobacco product marketing.

===Flavored tobacco===
A ban on flavored tobacco, as mandated by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, was implemented by the CTP on September 22, 2009. This law bans the sale or distribution of any cigarettes containing an artificial or natural flavor other than tobacco. This ban does not apply to menthol.

===Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee===
The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act called for the creation of a [[Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee]] (TPSAC), and the inaugural meeting for this committee was held on March 30–31, 2010. The main purpose of the committee is to assess health and safety issues concerning tobacco products, and then provide advice, information, or recommendations to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs based on their findings.
Some specific reports they are responsible for include:
* Impact of menthol in cigarettes on public health
* Impact of [[dissolvable tobacco]] on public health
* Effect of changing nicotine yields in tobacco products, and whether there is a certain level below which nicotine does not produce dependence
* Any application for a modified risk tobacco product

The committee has 12 members, one of which is the chair of the committee. The members are chosen by the Commissioner and are individuals with expertise in the field of medicine, science or technology involving tobacco products. There are 9 voting members, all of whom work in the health care profession in specialties relevant to tobacco use (such as pulmonology, cardiology, toxicology, etc.). One member will be either a federal or local government employee, and one will be a representative of the general public. The three non-voting members will include representatives of various parts of the tobacco industry: one representative of the growers, one of the manufacturing industry, and one of the small-business tobacco manufacturing industry. All members will serve four-year terms.

==Tobacco industry response==

===Suing the FDA===

Five tobacco companies, including [[Lorillard Tobacco Company]], L.P., and [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]], filed a civil lawsuit in federal court against the United States and the FDA in response of the legislation. The suit was filed in Bowling Green, Kentucky, home to [[Imperial Tobacco|Commonwealth Brands]], another tobacco company named in the suit.

The plaintiffs' (the tobacco companies) objections to the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act and policies decided upon by the Center for Tobacco Control included:
* A full ban on the use of colors and graphics on cigarette and smokeless tobacco packaging
* A ban on the ability for a tobacco company to sponsor an event or piece of merchandise with their brand name
* The FDA’s authorization of "further restrictions", allowing federal, state, local, and Indian governments to enact legislation more strict than the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act
* A mandated size increase of tobacco warnings on packaging, including "color graphics depicting the negative health consequences of smoking to accompany the label statements"
* The FDA’s ability to regulate relative risk claims made on Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTP’s)
* Requiring that products may not advertise the fact that they are regulated by the FDA
* A ban on all forms of outdoor advertising
* A ban on the ability to include samples and gifts with the sale of tobacco products

Notably, the tobacco companies argued that the increased size of warning labels on cigarette packing and new restrictions on the design of the packaging interfere with their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights to communicate with adult consumers. In addition, they argued against the ban on publicizing relative risk claims about their products, which would apply to light cigarettes and various forms of smokeless tobacco on First Amendment grounds.

Judge Joseph H. McKinley, Jr. issued his Opinion of the Court on January 4, 2010. In reviewing the arguments of the plaintiffs and defendants, McKinley, Jr. ruled largely, but not completely, in favor of the United States and the FDA. Judge McKinley, Jr. ruled that a full ban of graphics and colors on all advertisements and packaging does infringe on the First Amendment rights of tobacco companies to communicate with their adult consumers without reasonably limiting the products’ appeal to youths. However, Judge McKinley, Jr. sided with the defendants on all other contested issues. He ruled that requiring enlarged warnings on packaging is reasonable because it serves to better alert the public about adverse health effects of smoking. He also found that giving the FDA the ability to regulate the use of the relative risk claims did not infringe on the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs.

===Support from Philip Morris===
American tobacco giants did not universally oppose FDA regulation upon the passing of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. [[Altria Group]], the parent company of [[Philip Morris USA]], has spoken out in support of the legislation. According to its website, Philip Morris has favored "tough but reasonable federal regulation of tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration."  The company also says that the legislation can be beneficial to adult consumers, and that they want "to work with the FDA as it implements a comprehensive national regulatory framework."

Philip Morris has not always supported such broad tobacco regulation. In 1996, they joined other tobacco companies in the major lawsuit that eventually led to [[FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.]] being argued before the Supreme Court. However, since 2000, the company has supported "meaningful tobacco regulation." Philip Morris, the maker of [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] brand cigarettes and over a dozen other brands, has much to gain in this legislation. By further reducing tobacco companies’ ability to advertise, Philip Morris’ current US market share of 50% is in effect solidified as other companies are less able to convince consumers to switch to their products. The only downside for Philip Morris is that all companies will be taxed in proportion to their market share.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6732">A '''retrospective cohort study''', also called a '''historic cohort study''', is a [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] [[cohort study]] used in [[Medical research|medical]] and [[psychological research]]. A [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] of individuals that share a common [[Risk factor|exposure factor]] is compared to [[Treatment and control groups|another group]] of equivalent individuals not exposed to that factor, to determine the factor's influence on the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence of a condition]] such as disease or death. Retrospective cohort studies have existed for approximately as long as [[prospective cohort studies]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epidemiology.ch/history/papers/doll-paper2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The retrospective cohort study compares groups of individuals who are alike in many ways but differ by a certain characteristic (for example, female nurses who smoke and ones who do not smoke) in terms of a particular [[outcome (probability)|outcome]] (such as [[lung cancer]]).&lt;ref name="urlDefinition of historic cohort study - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=286525|title=Definition of historic cohort study - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data on the relevant events for each individual (the form and time of exposure to a factor, the latent period, and the time of any subsequent occurrence of the outcome) are collected from existing records and can immediately be analyzed&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt; to determine the [[relative risk]] of the cohort compared to the control group. This is expressed as a [[risk ratio]] or [[odds ratio]].&lt;ref name="statsdirect.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prospective vs. Retrospective Studies|url=http://www.statsdirect.com/help/basics/prospective.htm|website=StatsDirect|publisher=StatsDirect|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is fundamentally the same methodology as for a prospective cohort study, except that the retrospective study is performed post-hoc, looking back.&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mann|first1=C J|title=Observational research methods. Research design II: cohort, cross sectional, and case-control studies|journal=Emergency Medicine Journal|date=1 January 2003|volume=20|pages=54–60|url=http://emj.bmj.com/content/20/1/54.full|accessdate=2 August 2017|publisher=BMJ Publishing Group Ltd|doi=10.1136/emj.20.1.54|pmc=1726024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prospective study looks forward, enrolling patients unaffected by the outcome and observing them to see whether the outcome has occurred.&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt; However, both kinds of cohort studies share the same starting point (considering data from before the occurrence of the outcome). The first objective is still to establish two groups - exposed versus non-exposed - which are then assessed retrospectively to establish the most likely temporal sequence of events leading to the current disease state in both the exposed and unexposed groups.

Retrospective cohort studies require particular caution because errors due to confounding and bias are more common than in prospective studies.&lt;ref name="statsdirect.com"/&gt;

==Advantages==
Retrospective cohort studies exhibit the benefits of [[Cohort Study (Statistics)|cohort studies]] and have distinct advantages relative to prospective ones:
*They are conducted on a smaller scale.&lt;ref name="medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com"/&gt; 
*They typically require less time to complete.&lt;ref name="medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com"/&gt; 
*They are generally less expensive, because resources are mainly devoted to collecting data.&lt;ref name="ocw.tufts.edu"/&gt;[dead link]
*They are better for analyzing multiple outcomes.&lt;ref name="ocw.tufts.edu"/&gt;
*In a medical context, they can potentially address [[rare disease]]s, which would necessitate extremely large cohorts in prospective studies.&lt;ref name="medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com"/&gt; 
Retrospective studies are especially helpful in addressing diseases of low incidence, since affected people have already been identified so .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/Wairdocs/ILRI/x5436E/x5436e06.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that retrospective studies are generally less expensive than prospective studies may be another key benefit.&lt;ref name="ocw.tufts.edu"/&gt; Additionally, it has essentially all the benefits of a [[Cohort Study (Statistics)|cohort study]].

==Disadvantages==
Retrospective studies have disadvantages vis-a-vis prospective studies: 
*Some key statistics cannot be measured, and significant biases may affect the selection of controls.&lt;ref name="medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com"&gt;http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/retrospective+study&lt;/ref&gt;
*Researchers cannot control exposure or outcome assessment, and instead must rely on others for accurate recordkeeping.&lt;ref name="ocw.tufts.edu"/&gt; When relying on individual recall of former exposure to risk variables, recall may be inaccurate and subject to biases.&lt;ref name="medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com"/&gt; It can be very difficult to make accurate comparisons between the exposed and the non-exposed.&lt;ref name="ocw.tufts.edu"/&gt;
*The retrospective aspect may introduce [[selection bias]] and mis-classification or [[information bias (epidemiology)|information bias]].&lt;ref&gt;https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat507/node/54&lt;/ref&gt; With retrospective studies, the temporal relationship is frequently difficult to assess.&lt;ref name="ocw.tufts.edu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=James|first1=James N|title=Retrospective Cohort Study: Strengths and Weaknesses|url=http://ocw.tufts.edu/Content/1/lecturenotes/194039/194062|website=Tufts Open Courseware|publisher=Tufts University|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Retrospective studies may need very large sample sizes for rare outcomes.&lt;ref name="ocw.tufts.edu"/&gt;

==Comparison with case-control studies==
While retrospective cohort studies try to compare the risk of developing a disease to some already known exposure factors, a [[case-control study]] will try to determine the possible exposure factors after a known disease incidence. Both the relative risk and odds ratio are relevant in retrospective cohort studies, but only the odds ratio can be used in case-control studies. Although most case-control studies are retrospective, they can also be prospective when the researcher still enrolls participants based on the occurrence of a disease as new cases occur.

{{nihongo|'''Sadako Sasaki'''|佐々木 禎子|Sasaki Sadako|January 7, 1943 – October 25, 1955}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] girl who was 2 years old when an American [[atomic bomb]] was [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped on Hiroshima]] on August 6, 1945, near her home next to the Misasa Bridge. Sasaki became one of the most widely known ''[[hibakusha]]''&amp;nbsp;– a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term meaning "bomb-affected person". She is remembered through the story of the [[one thousand origami cranes]] she folded before her death, and is to this day a symbol of the innocent victims of [[nuclear warfare]].

==Overview==
Sadako Sasaki was at home when the explosion occurred, about {{convert|1.6|km|0}} away from [[ground zero]]. She was blown out of the window and her mother ran out to find her, suspecting she may be dead, but instead finding her two-year-old daughter alive with no apparent injuries. While they were fleeing, Sasaki and her mother were caught in the [[Nuclear fallout|black rain]]. Her grandmother rushed back to the house and was never to be seen again. After the bombing, Sasaki grew up like her peers and became an important member of her class [[relay team]].

In November 1954, Sasaki developed swellings on her neck and behind her ears. In January 1955, [[purpura]] had formed on her legs. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with acute malignant lymph gland [[leukemia]] (her mother and others in Hiroshima referred to it as "atomic bomb disease"). She was hospitalized on February 20, 1955, and given a year to live.

Several years after the atomic explosion an increase in [[leukemia]] was observed, especially among children. By the early 1950s, it was clear that the leukemia was caused by radiation exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Radiation Effects Research Foundation (former [[Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission]]) [http://www.rerf.or.jp/radefx/late_e/leukemia.html "Leukemia risks among atomic-bomb survivors"] Accessed 2011-10-30&lt;/ref&gt;

She was admitted as a patient to the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital for treatment and given blood transfusions on February 21, 1955. By the time she was admitted, her white blood cell count was six times higher compared to the levels of an average child.

In August 1955, she was moved into a room with a girl named Kiyo, a junior high school student who was two years older than her. It was shortly after getting this roommate that cranes were brought to her room from a local high school club. Sasaki's father, Shigeo, told her the legend of the cranes and she set herself a goal of folding 1,000 of them, which was believed to grant the folder a wish. Although she had plenty of free time during her days in the hospital, Sasaki lacked paper. She would use medicine wrappings and whatever else she could scrounge; this included going to other patients' rooms to ask to use the paper from their get-well presents. Her best friend, Chizuko Hamamoto, would bring paper from school for Sasaki to use.

A popular version of the story is that Sasaki fell short of her goal of folding 1,000 cranes, having folded only 644 before her death, and that her friends completed the 1,000 and buried them all with her. (This comes from the novelized version of her life ''[[Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes]]''.) However, an exhibit which appeared in the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]] stated that by the end of August 1955, Sasaki had achieved her goal and continued to fold 300 more cranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/VirtualMuseum_e/exhibit_e/exh0107_e/exh01071_e.html|title=Special Exhibition 1|website=www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadako's older brother, Masahiro Sadako, says in his book ''The Complete Story of Sadako Sasaki'' that she exceeded her goal.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Story of Sadako Sasaki' ({{ISBN|9781938193019}}) co-written with [[Sue DiCicco]], founder of the [[Peace Crane Project]]}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her time in the hospital, her condition progressively worsened. Around mid-October, her left leg became swollen and turned purple. After her family urged her to eat something, Sasaki requested [[Chazuke|tea on rice]] and remarked "It's tasty". She then thanked her family. Those were her last words. With her family and friends around her, Sasaki died on the morning of October 25, 1955, at the age of 12.

After her death, Sasaki's body was examined by the [[Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission]] (ABCC) for research on the effects of the atomic bomb on the human body. It was later revealed that the ABCC had also conducted tests on Sasaki while she was alive for the same reasons.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Memorial==

After her death, Sasaki's friends and schoolmates published a collection of letters in order to raise funds to build a memorial to her and all of the children who had died from the effects of the atomic bomb, for example the Japanese girl [[Yoko Moriwaki]]. In 1958, a [[Children's Peace Monument|statue of Sasaki holding a golden crane]] was unveiled in the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]].  At the foot of the statue is a plaque that reads:  "This is our cry. This is our prayer. Peace in the world."

There is also a statue of her in the [[Peace Park (Seattle)|Seattle Peace Park]]. Sasaki has become a leading symbol of the impact of [[nuclear war]]. Sasaki is also a [[heroine]] for many girls in Japan. Her story is told in some [[Japan]]ese schools on the anniversary of the [[Hiroshima]] bombing. Dedicated to Sasaki, people all over Japan celebrate August 6 as the annual [[peace]] day.

A '''vaginal septum''' is a [[vaginal anomalies|vaginal anomaly]] that is partition within the [[vagina]]; such a [[septum]] could be either longitudinal or transverse. In some affected women, the septum is partial or does not extend the length or width of the vagina.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinonen|first=Pentti K.|date=2006-03-01|title=Complete septate uterus with longitudinal vaginal septum|url=http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(05)03968-3/fulltext|journal=Fertility and Sterility|language=English|volume=85|issue=3|pages=700–705|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.08.039|issn=0015-0282}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dyspareunia|Pain during intercourse]] can be a symptom. A longitudinal vaginal septum develops during [[embryogenesis]] when there is an incomplete fusion of the lower parts of the two [[Müllerian duct]]s. As a result, there may appear to be two openings to the vagina. There may be associated duplications of the more cranial parts of the Müllerian derivatives, a double [[cervix]], and either a [[uterine septum]] or [[uterus didelphys]] (double uterus).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perez-Brayfield MR, Clarke HS, Pattaras JG |title=Complete bladder, urethral, and vaginal duplication in a 50-year-old woman |journal=Urology |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=514 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12350504 |doi=10.1016/S0090-4295(02)01808-3  |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0090429502018083}}&lt;/ref&gt; A transverse septum forms during embryogenesis when the Müllerian ducts do not fuse to the [[urogenital sinus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13568">Voluntary intoxication, where a defendant has wilfully consumed drink or drugs before committing acts which constitute the prohibited conduct (''[[actus reus]]'') of an offence, has posed a considerable problem for the [[English criminal law]]. There is a correspondence between incidences of drink and crimes of violence, such as assaults and stabbings. Accordingly, there is a debate about the effect of voluntary intoxication on the mental element of crimes, which is often that the defendant foresaw the consequences, or that they intended them.

In dealing with this issue and balancing theoretical problems with public policy issues, the English law has categorised offences into two categories, those of [[basic intent]] and those of [[specific intent]]. In the latter, the defendant's intoxication will be directly relevant as to whether he or she formed the necessary intent. In the former, the picture is more complicated and unclear, although it is known that intoxication will not provide a defence where recklessness can be shown on the accepted facts. Crimes of specific intent include murder, and those of basic intent most crimes of recklessness, including [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]].

==Basis==
There is a widely held belief that alcohol consumption fuels violence.&lt;ref name="simester686"/&gt; The picture may be more complex involving other factors, including the effects of chronic alcohol abuse rather than its immediate effects.&lt;ref name="taylor128"/&gt;

Neither voluntary nor involuntary intoxication provide a defence in English law in themselves. No behavior is excusable merely because it was committed whilst intoxicated, and the phrase "a drunken intent is still an intent" &amp;ndash; used in ''Sheehan''&lt;ref name="sheehan"/&gt; &amp;ndash;has not been abandoned.&lt;ref name="simester686"/&gt;  Where an individual voluntarily intoxicates himself, it is not a defence for him to then claim he does not intend any actions he commits while intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; The [[F. E. Smith, 1st Viscount Birkenhead|Earl of Birkenhead]] stated in 1920 that until the early 19th century voluntary drunkenness was never a defence, based on the principle that "a man who by his own voluntary act debauches and destroys his will power shall be no better situated in regard to criminal acts than a sober man".&lt;ref name="beard"/&gt; This was considered the authority by [[Lord Elwyn-Jones]] in the ''Majewski'' case.&lt;ref name="majewski"/&gt;  Instead, intoxication may assist the defence arguing that the defendant lacked the appropriate ''mens rea'' (mental element) for the crime.&lt;ref name="simester686"/&gt;   However, it has been recognised at common law that those who would not intend to commit a crime if sober cannot be held to the same level of culpability as those who would. Thus, the approach of the courts is generally to find intoxicated individuals guilty of crimes which require basic intent, rather than the specific intent required for other crimes.&lt;ref name="ormerod276"/&gt;

==Specific and basic intent==
In ''Majewski'', Lord Elwyn-Jones, giving judgement, indicated that a crime was one of specific intent if the ''mens rea''  went further than the ''actus reus'' (prohibited acts, as they actually occurred); in other words, that the crime was one of [[ulterior intent]].&lt;ref name="majewski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester688"/&gt; This makes sense in the case of burglary and of criminal damage with intent to endanger life, where the intent need not be carried out, and which have been judged crimes of specific intent.&lt;ref name="simester688"/&gt; However, this fails to explain why  [[Murder in English law|murder]] is considered a crime of specific intent, despite the fact that its mental aspect, intent to cause grievous bodily harm or death, is equal or less than the ''actus reus'' requirement of causing death.&lt;ref name="simester688"/&gt; Similarly, causing gross bodily harm with intent (contrary to section 18 of the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]]) has a matching''mens rea'' and yet is also considered a crime of specific intent.&lt;ref name="simester688689"/&gt;

[[Jocelyn Simon, Baron Simon of Glaisdale|Lord Simon]]'s judgement in the same case advanced a different definition: crimes of specific intent required a "purposive element". The court in ''Heard'' considered a specific intent one which fitted either possible definition.&lt;ref name="heard"/&gt; However, murder is again an exception: since ''[[R v Woolin|Woolin]]'', it can be committed not by intent but by virtual certainty and foresight of virtual certainty.&lt;ref name="simester689"/&gt;  Lord Elwyn-Jones also expressed that if a crime could be committed recklessly, it was one of basic intent. This is supported by a number of academics, who do however consider it a matter for the common law to establish by precedent.&lt;ref name="simester689"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ormerod279"/&gt;

The distinction between crimes of specific and basic intent is demonstrated by the intoxication case of ''[[R v Lipman]]''.&lt;ref name="lipman"/&gt; Here, a man who had voluntarily taken [[LSD]] struck and asphyxiated a woman while [[Hallucination#Drug-induced_hallucination|hallucinating]], believing her to be a snake. The man was found to lack the specific intent required of murder, but satisfied the basic intention of [[Manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]], that of recklessness. While it has been argued that there is no consistent principle behind the distinction,&lt;ref name="ormerod279"/&gt; there has been some judicial effort to suggest a means of categorisation.&lt;ref name="ormerod279"/&gt;

===Intoxication and specific intent===
Case law has established that murder, [[Non-fatal offences against the person in English law#Wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent|wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent]], [[theft]], [[robbery]], [[burglary]] with intent to steal, [[handling stolen goods]], some forms of criminal damage, and any attempt to commit a crime of specific intent are themselves crimes of specific intent.&lt;ref name="simester689"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ormerod279"/&gt;

Where the defendant is on trial for a crime of specific intent, his state of intoxication will be relevant to whether he formed the required intent.&lt;ref name="simester688"/&gt; This may prevent the defendant from having the required ''mens rea''. If the defendant's intoxication is so significant as to prevent any sort of intent, this can lead to acquittal. A reduction in the strength of the formed intent is insufficient.&lt;ref name="ormerod276"/&gt; In coming to this conclusion, the court in ''Sheehan''&lt;ref name="sheehan"/&gt; placed a new interpretation on the words of [[Lord Birkenhead]] in ''Beard'',&lt;ref name="beard"/&gt; taking account of the decision in ''Woolmington''.&lt;ref name="woolmington"/&gt; Lord Birkenhead's words had been that intoxication would be relevant where it prevented the defendant from being''capable'' of forming the necessary intent.&lt;ref name="simester688"/&gt;

===Intoxication and basic intent===
Manslaughter, rape, sexual assault, maliciously wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm, kidnapping and false imprisonment, [[Non-fatal offences against the person in English law#Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] and [[Non-fatal offences against the person in English law#Assault and battery|common assault]] have all been judged crimes of basic intent. Attempting a crime of basic intent may be a crime of basic intent, but this is unclear.&lt;ref name="simester689"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ormerod280"/&gt;

The court in ''Majewski'' refers to intoxication as a [[defence (law)|defence]].&lt;ref name="majewski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ormerod276277"/&gt; If this were the case, in crimes of basic intent where it does not provide a defence, the counsel for the defendant could not argue that the defendant did not have the required ''mens rea'' because of intoxication. Accordingly, the ''mens rea'' become irrelevant and the Crown need not show it, thereby aiding the prosecution considerably.&lt;ref name="ormerod277"/&gt; The alternative is that the voluntary intoxication provides a "prior fault" which substitutes for the ''mens rea'' required. This would leave the prosecution the task of showing voluntary intoxication to the satisfaction of the jury and the avoidance of doubt.&lt;ref name="ormerod277"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester691692"/&gt;  However, the taking of alcohol or drugs probably bears little similarity to the rest of the crime the defendant stands accused of it. It is removed in both its nature and possibly significantly in time.&lt;ref name="ormerod277"/&gt; The alternative would be to require the prosecution to still show the required ''mens rea''. The defendant's intoxication would be disregarded and the defendant's state of mind assessed as it was. It would, however, rapidly become a question of whether the defendant would have foreseen the consequences had he been sober. This would, however, necessarily require finding defendants such as Lipman&lt;ref name="lipman"/&gt; guilty, even where he was unconscious.&lt;ref name="simester691692"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ormerod278"/&gt;

Neither possibility has been explored in the common law. Accordingly, it only possible to say that the defence cannot argue that intoxication provides a defence, where recklessness has been shown on the fact, in crimes of basic intent. It is possible that the prosecution would be allowed, in certain circumstances, to dispense with the original ''mens rea'' entirely and rely solely on the voluntary intoxication to provide the fault element.&lt;ref name="simester692"/&gt;

==Different types of drugs==

The case law on voluntary intoxication, and the  ''Majewski'' doctrine, has focussed on intoxication by alcohol.&lt;ref name="ormerod281"/&gt; In ''Lipman'' this was extended to the illegal drug LSD, well known for its hallucinative effects.&lt;ref name="lipman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ormerod281"/&gt; In respect of other drugs, courts have restricted the scope of the ''Majewski'' formulation: in ''Bailey'',&lt;ref name="bailey"/&gt; a [[diabetic]]'s failure to eat as advised after taking a quantity of [[insulin]] was not considered voluntary intoxication; in ''Hardie'',&lt;ref name="hardie"/&gt; a taker of [[diazepam]] ([[Valium]]) was similarly excluded.&lt;ref name="simester695"/&gt;  They established a further test, in order to exclude these types of defendants from a voluntary intoxication rule with a non-applicable public policy basis.&lt;ref name="simester695"/&gt;

Based on a physiological distinction that did not exist in a medical sense, the court distinguished between alcohol and illegal drugs on one hand, and "therapeutic" or "merely soporific or sedative" drugs on the other.&lt;ref name="simester695"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ormerod282"/&gt; Therefore, the question is twofold: to find voluntary intoxication, the defendant must appreciate that taking the drug may lead to "aggressive, unpredictable and uncontrollable conduct" (''Bailey''), but only generally speaking &amp;ndash; he need not foresee any particular crime occurring.&lt;ref name="ormerod282"/&gt;
