== Biography ==
From a broken home, Saunders grew up being looked after by his extended family. By his teens, he became involved in local crime and in 2005 was incarcerated for eight months.&lt;ref name="DOC" /&gt; After this he became involved in music promotion and formed a group called Blood Money Union, which consisted of other DJs, producers and rappers.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;

Saunders' first success in rapping had come with a self-released record called "Dirty Foot," which he wrote while still in high school&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; and distributed in the [[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]] area, at the urging of his cousin. After hearing it played in a local dance club and then witnessing another rapper's performance, 2 Pistols had his first chance to perform on-stage. After taking the stage and performing his own single ("Dirty Foot"), 2 Pistols' confidence in his abilities grew to a point that he began to take his chances at making a career of music seriously.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;

His debut album, ''[[Death Before Dishonor (album)|Death Before Dishonor]]'', was released on June 17, 2008&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Listing at [http://www.billboard.com/artist/431860/2-pistols/chart Billboard.com], accessed October 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and featured production from the [[Grammy]]-winning [[J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League]], Da Honorable C.N.O.T.E, Bolo Da Producer, and others. Other tracks from the album included "You Know Me feat. Ray J" &amp; "Thats My Word feat.Trey Songz"," in addition to "[[She Got It]]." The album peaked at #32 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, and rose to #10 on the Billboard Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop album chart.&lt;ref name="amcharts"&gt;{{cite web | title = Billboard Chart information at AllMusic.com | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1034303|pure_url=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 Pistols resides in [[Tampa, Florida]] and currently releases his music under his own label, Blood Money Union. In February 2014, the album ''Comin Back Hard'' appeared through Stage One Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://hiphopsrevival.com/2014/09/03/qa-2-pistols-talks-working-with-french-montana-his-current-deal-situations-the-florida-music-scene-more/|title = Q&amp;A 2 Pistols talks working with French Montana, his current deal situations, the florida music-scene &amp; more.|date = September 3, 2014|accessdate = October 15, 2014|website = Hip Hop Revival|publisher = |last = Goodwin|first = Travis|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141021190751/http://hiphopsrevival.com/2014/09/03/qa-2-pistols-talks-working-with-french-montana-his-current-deal-situations-the-florida-music-scene-more/|archive-date = October 21, 2014|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1789">'''Albert (Albert I)''' (before 1131 – 29 September 1162), [[Counts of Chiny|Count of Chiny]], son of [[Otto II, Count of Chiny|Otto II]], Count of Chiny, and Adélaïs of Namur.  He succeeded his father before 1131 and spent most of his time in Chiny, not taking part in the various conflicts which shook the region.

He married Agnes, daughter of [[Reginald I, Count of Bar|Renaud I]], Count of Bar and Gisèle Vaudémont, daughter of [[:fr:Gérard Ier de Vaudémont|Gerard]], [[Count of Vaudémont]].  Their children were:
* 	[[Louis III, Count of Chiny|Louis III]], Count of Chiny
* 	Thierry (d. after 1207), Lord of Mellier, married Elizabeth
* 	Arnulf of Chiny-Verdun (killed in 1181), [[Bishop of Verdun]], 1172–1181
* 	Alix (d. after 1177), married to Manasses of Hierges
* 	Ida of Chiny, married to Gobert V, Lord of Aspremont (see [[Fredelon and the House of Esch]] for a discussion of their descendants)
* 	A daughter, mother of Roger Walehem
* 	Hughes, married to a daughter of Renaud de Donchéry
* 	A daughter, Abbess of Givet.
Arnulf was killed by an arrow to the head in front of the castle of Saint Manehulde during an attack on the bishopric of Verdun.

Alix and Mannases were the parents of Albert II of Hierges, [[Bishop of Verdun]] (1186–1208). Ida and Gobert were the grandparents of John I of Aspremont, [[Bishop of Verdun]] (1217–1224).

Albert was succeeded as Count of Chiny by his son Louis.

'''Barry Cowsill''' (September 14, 1954 – [[Circa|c.]] August 29, 2005) was an American musician and member of the musical group [[The Cowsills]].

==Career==
Cowsill was born in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], the fifth of seven children. As a teenager, he became the drummer (and later the bass guitar player) of the band initially formed by his brothers [[Bill Cowsill|Bill]] and [[Bob Cowsill]], playing popular tunes at local dance clubs. By the late 1960s, the band expanded to include younger brother John (on drums), his mother Barbara, older brother Paul, and younger sister Susan. [[The Cowsills]] went on to churn out a string of hits (including the #2's "The Rain the Park and Other Things" and "[[Hair (Hair song)|Hair]]") before officially disbanding by 1972.&lt;ref name="dougher"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dougher|first=Steve|date=December 17, 1990|title=As Apple-Cheeked Stars of the '60s, the Cowsills Lost Their Family to Fame; Now They're Finding Harmony Again|journal=People|publisher=Time, Inc.|volume=34|issue=24|issn=0093-7673|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113952,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the group broke up, Cowsill moved frequently and worked various jobs including construction and waiting tables.&lt;ref name="gillis"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Musical Life Falls Into Silence|last=Gillis|first=James J.|date=November 15, 2005|work=Newport Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, Cowsill owned a bar in [[Austin]] which he admitted he lost because he "drank it dry. I was drinking my face off in those days."&lt;ref name="dougher"/&gt; Throughout his life, he continued to play music and participated in various post-heyday incarnations of the Cowsills. In 1998, he released his first solo CD, ''As Is''.&lt;ref name="mclellan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jan/06/local/me-cowsill6|title=Barry Cowsill, 51; Pop Group Member an Apparent Katrina Victim|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=January 6, 2006|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, he relocated to his hometown of Newport, Rhode Island.

==Personal life==
In 1987, Cowsill married a woman named Deborah with whom he had two children (he also had an older daughter). Cowsill and his wife were divorced in 2003.&lt;ref name="gillis"/&gt;

==Death==
On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the city of New Orleans. Cowsill, who chose not to evacuate, weathered the storm in an abandoned warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Bill Cowsill|date= |year=2011|title=Family Band: The Cowsills Story|medium=|format=Motion picture|time=1:00:01-2|location= |publisher=Thinking Bee Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowsill survived the storm but was in need of help. He called his sister Susan from a pay phone (Susan also lived in New Orleans with her family but chose to evacuate) and left four voice mail messages saying he was surrounded by looters and people shooting.

Industrial biorefineries have been identified as the most promising route to the creation of a new domestic biobased industry producing entire spectrum of bioproducts or [[bio-based products]].

Biomass has various components such as [[lignin]], [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]], extractives, etc. Biorefinery can take advantage of the unique properties of each of biomass components enabling the production of various products. The various bioproducts can include fiber, fuels, chemicals, plastics etc.

'''''Camponotus saundersi''''' is a [[species]] of [[ant]] found in [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]], belonging to the [[genus]] of [[Carpenter ant]]s. A worker can explode suicidally and aggressively as an ultimate act of defense, an ability it has in common with several other species in this genus and a few other [[insects]].&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = T.

Its defensive behaviours include self-destruction by [[autothysis]], a term coined by Maschwitz and Maschwitz (1974).&lt;ref name=Maschwitz&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maschwitz | first1 = Ulrich | last2 = Maschwitz | first2 = Eleonore | date = 1974 | title = Platzende Arbeiterinnen: Eine neue Art der Feindabwehr bei sozialen Hautflüglern | journal = Oecologia | volume = 14 | pages =  289–294 | jstor = 4214927 | doi = 10.1007/BF01039798 | language = de }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two oversized, poison-filled [[mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibular]] glands run the entire length of the ant's body.

Direct observation by Jones (2004) found that ''C. saundersi'' adhesive secretions range from bright white at the end of the wet season to cream or pale yellow in the dry season and start of the wet season. These variations in coloration represent a shift in internal [[pH]], likely due to seasonal changes in diet.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;

===Territorial defense===
[[Autothysis]] in ''C. saundersi'' is common during territorial battles with other ant species or groups. Territorial [[weaver ants]] (''Oecophylla smaragdina'') are known to stalk and attack ''C. saundersi'' for territory as well as for predation.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt; Self-sacrifice of ''C. saundersi'' workers is likely to help the colony as a whole by ensuring that the colony retains its foraging territory.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt; Therefore, such behavior would continue within a population given that the behavior was already genetically present within the majority of workers.

===Defense against predation===
''C. saundersi'' uses [[autothysis]] to defend against predation by other [[arboreal]] arthropods ([[weaver ants]], spiders), which are believed to be the main predatory threat to ''C. saundersi'' for two reasons:
:1. Jones (2004) noted through direct observation that ''C. saundersi'' is "remarkably sensitive" to even slight leaf vibration.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;
:2. The inherent adhesive qualities of ''C. saundersi''’s secretion are more effective in immobilizing the [[appendages]] of arthropods as opposed to those of vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Maschwitz /&gt;
''C. saundersi'' also uses [[autothysis]] to defend against vertebrate predators because the chemicals involved are inedible, which could deter certain predators from engaging this species of ant in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shorter|first1=J. R.|last2=Rueppell|first2=O.|title=A Review on Self-Destructive Defense Behaviors in Social Insects|journal=[[Insectes Sociaux]]|date=2012|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1007/s00040-01111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemicals==
The "toxic glue" of ''C. saundersi'' is predominately composed of polyacetates, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and alcohols.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;&lt;ref name=Betz /&gt; Branched-skeleton lactones and methylated isocoumarins produced in the hindgut function as trail pheromones, while straight-chain hydrocarbons and esters produced in the Dufour‘s glands act as alarm pheromones in ''C. saundersi'' and related species.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;
Jones, et al. (2004) identified the following chemicals within the secretion:

[[Phenols]]
* [[m-cresol]] (traces found), a corrosive compound
* 2,4-Dihydroxyacetophenone
* 2-Methyl-5,7-dihydroxychromone
* [[Orcinol]] (traces found)
[[Aliphatic compound|Aliphatics]]
* [[Undecane]]
* [[2-Heptanone]] (traces found)
[[Terpenoid]]s
* [[Citronellal]]
* [[Citronellol]]
* Citronellic acid
* Isopulegol
* (6R)-(E)-2,6-Dimethyl-2-octen-1,8-dionic acid

Both 2,4-Dihydroxyacetophenone and 2-Methyl-5,7-dihydroxychromone are phenolic ketones which cause the pH-dependent color changes of the secretion.

(6R)-(E)-2,6-Dimethyl-2-octen-1,8-dionic acid is an [[Monoterpene#Acyclic monoterpenes|acyclic monoterpene]] previously undocumented in insects. However, the chemical is well known to be a urinary [[metabolite]] in mammals, with overproduction resulting in toxic [[acidosis]] in various species.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;

[[Child sexual abuse]] is often kept secret:
{{quote|A victim of child sexual abuse is under a great deal of pressure to keep the abuse secret. In many cases of child molestation, the molester has threatened to harm the child or a member of the child's family. The molester might have told the child that he would not be believed even if the child did tell. Another common situation is that the molester will tell the child that if the child tells about the abuse, he will get into trouble. The clear message is given to the child that if another person finds out, something bad will happen to the child. This pressure to maintain silence can often be successfully overcome by establishing open communication between children and adults through a proper educational program for children.&lt;ref name=BSA&gt;[http://www.scouting.org/HealthandSafety/GSS/gss01.aspx Boy Scouts of America official web site Guide to Safe Scouting]. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==Prevention==

While it is not always possible to stop every case of clandestine abuse, it may be possible to prevent many incidents through policies in [[youth]] organizations.

The '''social isolation model''' asserts that:
{{quote|violence is possible where a [[Victimology|victim]] is [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolated]] and violent behavior and its effects are unlikely to come to light.  The "two-deep" policy of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] requires that a minimum of two adults be present during all activities to minimize the potential for clandestine abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forensiceducation.com/sourcebooks/glossary/s.htm#45 Forensic glossary]. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

The [[Boy Scouts of America|BSA]] policy states:
{{quote|The Boy Scouts of America has adopted a number of policies aimed at eliminating opportunities for abuse within the Scouting program. These policies focus on leadership selection and on placing barriers to abuse within the program.... ... Two-deep leadership [means that] Two registered adult leaders or one registered leader and a parent of a participant, one of whom must be 21 years of age or older, are required on all trips and outings. The chartered organization is responsible for ensuring that sufficient leadership is provided for all activities.&lt;ref name=BSA /&gt;|}}

Other policies of the BSA state:
{{quote|One-on-one contact between adults and youth members is not permitted. In situations that require personal conferences, such as a Scoutmaster's conference, the meeting is to be conducted in view of other adults and youths.... Adult leaders must respect the privacy of youth members in situations such as changing clothes and taking showers at camp, and intrude only to the extent that health and safety require. Adults must protect their own privacy in similar situations.... When camping, no youth is permitted to sleep in the tent of an adult other than his own parent or guardian.... The Boy Scouts of America does not recognize any secret organizations as part of its program. All aspects of the Scouting program are open to observation by parents and leaders.&lt;ref name=BSA /&gt;|}}

==Drug crimes==
A person, especially a child, may be abused in secret because the victim has witnessed ''another'' clandestine crime, such as a working [[Methamphetamine]] [[laboratory]].&lt;ref name=Meth&gt;[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/publications/bulletins/children/ "Children at Clandestine Methamphetamine Labs: Helping Meth’s Youngest Victims", by Karen Wetlow, June 2003, US Department of Justice]. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The FBI concluded that "A coordinated multidisciplinary team is critical to ensure that the needs of meth’s youngest victims are met and that adequate information is available to prosecute child endangerment cases successfully."&lt;ref name=Meth /&gt;

uses [[bioinformatic]] methods{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} to complement experimental research in [[epigenetics]]. Due to the recent explosion of epigenome datasets, computational methods play an increasing role in all areas of epigenetic research.

==Definition==
Research in computational epigenetics comprises the development and application of bioinformatics methods for solving epigenetic questions, as well as computational data analysis and theoretical modeling in the context of epigenetics. This includes modelling of the effects of histone and DNA CpG island methylation.

==Current research areas==

===Epigenetic data processing and analysis===
[[File:ChIP-on-chip wet-lab.png|thumb|428x428px|ChIP-on-chip technique]]
Various experimental techniques have been developed for genome-wide mapping of epigenetic information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Madrigal|first=P|author2=Krajewski, P|title=Uncovering correlated variability in epigenomic datasets using the Karhunen-Loeve transform.|journal=BioData Mining|date=July 2015|volume=8|pages=20|doi=10.1186/s13040-015-0051-7|pmid=26140054|pmc=4488123}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most widely used being [[ChIP-on-chip]], [[ChIP-seq]] and [[bisulfite sequencing]]. All of these methods generate large amounts of data and require efficient ways of data processing and quality control by bioinformatic methods.

===Epigenome prediction===
A substantial amount of bioinformatic research has been devoted to the [[prediction]] of epigenetic information from characteristics of the [[genome sequence]]. Such predictions serve a dual purpose. First, accurate epigenome predictions can substitute for experimental data, to some degree, which is particularly relevant for newly discovered epigenetic mechanisms and for species other than human and mouse. Second, prediction algorithms build statistical models of epigenetic information from training data and can therefore act as a first step toward quantitative modeling of an epigenetic mechanism. Successful computational prediction of DNA and lysine methylation and acetylation has been achieved by combinations of various features.&lt;ref name="Shi2012"&gt;{{cite journal

===Applications in cancer epigenetics===
The important role of epigenetic defects for [[cancer]] opens up new opportunities for improved diagnosis and therapy. These active areas of research give rise to two questions that are particularly amenable to bioinformatic analysis. First, given a list of genomic regions exhibiting epigenetic differences between tumor cells and controls (or between different disease subtypes), can we detect common patterns or find evidence of a functional relationship of these regions to cancer? Second, can we use bioinformatic methods in order to improve diagnosis and therapy by detecting and classifying important disease subtypes?

==Emerging topics==
The first wave of research in the field of computational epigenetics was driven by rapid progress of experimental methods for data generation, which required adequate computational methods for data processing and quality control, prompted epigenome prediction studies as a means of understanding the genomic distribution of epigenetic information, and provided the foundation for initial projects on [[cancer epigenetics]]. While these topics will continue to be major areas of research and the mere quantity of epigenetic data arising from epigenome projects poses a significant bioinformatic challenge, several additional topics are currently emerging.
* Epigenetic regulatory circuitry: Reverse engineering the regulatory networks that read, write and execute epigenetic codes.
* [[Population epigenetics]]: Distilling regulatory mechanisms from the integration of epigenome data with [[gene expression]] profiles and [[haplotype]] maps for a large sample from a heterogeneous population.''
* [[Evolutionary epigenetics]]: Learning about epigenome regulation in human (and its medical consequences) by cross-species comparisons.
* Theoretical modeling: Testing our mechanistic and quantitative understanding of epigenetic mechanisms by [[in silico]] simulation.&lt;ref name="roznovat2013computational"&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Contagium vivum fluidum''''' (Latin: "contagious living fluid") was a phrase first used to describe a [[virus]], and underlined its ability to slip through the finest-mesh filters then available, giving it almost liquid properties. [[Martinus Beijerinck]] (1851-1931), a Dutch microbiologist and botanist, first used the term when studying the [[tobacco mosaic virus]], becoming convinced that the virus had a liquid nature. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nlv.ch/Virologytutorials/definition.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] had discovered that the cause of tobacco mosaic disease could pass through [[Chamberland filter|Chamberland's porcelain filter]]. He noted these findings but felt that they could only have resulted from a cracked filter. It was left to Beijerinck in 1898 to put forward the idea that the pathogen was small enough to pass through the filter routinely used to trap bacteria. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.microbiologytext.com/index.php?module=book&amp;func=displayarticle&amp;art_id=29&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivanovsky, irked that Beijerinck had not cited him, recreated Beijerinck's experimental set-up and demonstrated that particles of ink were small enough to pass through the filter, thus leaving the particulate or fluid nature of the pathogen unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6o8KaupH3e4C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=contagium+vivum+fluidum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QahExI3kin&amp;sig=v36wVUcd3hWcQmnRQPat5MP0GD0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TmXpUOLMDozL0AXsoYHYAw&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=contagium%20vivum%20fluidum&amp;f=false ''Where Tobacco Mosaic Has Led Us'' - Angela Creager]&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the [[electron microscope]] in 1931 led to the first virus images in 1935 by the American biochemist and virologist [[Wendell Meredith Stanley]]. The second half of the 1900s resulted in the discovery of more than 2 000 [[virus species]] infecting animals, plants and bacteria.

Furthermore, the culture of violence theory potentially accounts for inter-generational theories of violence and domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stith|first=Sandra M.|last2=Rosen|first2=Karen H.|last3=Middleton|first3=Kimberly A.|last4=Busch|first4=Amy L.|last5=Lundeberg|first5=Kirsten|last6=Carlton|first6=Russell P.|date=2000-08-01|title=The Intergenerational Transmission of Spouse Abuse: A Meta-Analysis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00640.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|language=en|volume=62|issue=3|pages=640–654|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00640.x|issn=1741-3737}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childhood exposure to violence in the household may later lead to similar patterns in marital relations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Similarly, early experience with domestic violence is likely to increase an individual's potential for development of clinical symptoms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mandelli|first=L.|last2=Petrelli|first2=C.|last3=Serretti|first3=A.|title=The role of specific early trauma in adult depression: A meta-analysis of published literature.

== Development of the theory ==
As mentioned previously the culture of violence theory addresses the pervasiveness of specific violent patterns within in a societal dimension.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specifically, culture of violence theory explains how cultures and societies can sanction violent acts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While related to [[structural violence]], cultural violence theory is different by explaining why direct acts of violence or violence built into systems of society exists and how they are legitimized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research suggests that cultures can encourage and permit violence to exist as a response to various environmental obstacles, such as widespread resource impoverishment.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199738403.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199738403-e-13|title=Culture of Honor, Violence, and Homicide|last=Brown|first=Ryan P.|last2=Osterman|first2=Lindsey L.|date=2012-07-20|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199738403.013.0013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen within various aspects of culture, such as film, television, music, language, art, and propaganda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ph.D|first=LeeAnn Kahlor|last2=Ph.D|first2=Matthew S.

== Relation to cultural values in the United States ==

=== Rape myths ===
[[Rape myths]] refer to the inaccurate views and stereotypes of forced sexual acts, and the victims and perpetuators of them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These notions are prevalent among the general population and often suggest that the victims of non-consensual sexual acts have bad reputations, are promiscuous, dress provocatively, or are fabricating assault when they regret the consensual acts after the fact.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These views are often legitimized by the status quo of men dominating women across domains such as family, education, work, and many others.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Rape myth acceptance can lead to poor assault/rape prevention measures, decrease in reporting of assaults/rapes, increases of assaults/rapes, and re-victimization.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Violence in relationships ===
Violence in relationships, commonly referred to as intimate partner violence (IPV), is impacted by various factors including the presence of mental illness or use of substances.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oram|first=S.|last2=Trevillion|first2=K.|last3=Khalifeh|first3=H.|last4=Feder|first4=G.|last5=Howard|first5=L.

=== Violence in pop culture and media ===
The prevalence of legitimization of violence may be facilitated by its presence in various media.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hald|first=Gert Martin|last2=Malamuth|first2=Neil M.|last3=Yuen|first3=Carlin|date=2010-01-01|title=Pornography and attitudes supporting violence against women: revisiting the relationship in nonexperimental studies|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ab.20328/abstract|journal=Aggressive Behavior|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=14–20|doi=10.1002/ab.20328|issn=1098-2337}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to suggest that sex-related crimes account for nearly 10% of all dialogue on television related to sex, most of which is found on fictional programs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, research has also found a positive relationship between pornography consumption and attitudes supporting violence against women, especially when the pornography in question is violent in nature.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, consideration of individual differences is necessary in evaluating exposure to violent media and overall outcomes.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffner|first=Cynthia A.|last2=Levine|first2=Kenneth J.|date=2005-05-01|title=Enjoyment of Mediated Fright and Violence: A Meta-Analysis|url=https://doi.org/10.1207/S1532785XMEP0702_5|journal=Media Psychology|volume=7|issue=2|pages=207–237|doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0702_5|issn=1521-3269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors which influence media content exposure and subsequent outcomes include gender and personality traits.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Individuals who are male, hostile, impulsive, and are low on empathy are more likely to be susceptible to violent media exposure.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Public justification of violence ===
Public justification of violence arise when those not necessarily directly involved in the violent act will not react negatively to the violence because they believe it is warranted.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Examples of public justification of violence are most evident in rape myths and victim blaming, as discussed above.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, the common belief regarding legitimate violence tends to place responsibility on victims or potential victims of violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Another example that is not as often noted, is the pervasive notion of the "chosen one," within some extremist religious language and various nationalism propaganda that will function as a means to perpetuate the undermining of the other and allowance of violence against the other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trauma responses and cultural violence ==
Early childhood trauma, specifically exposure to abuse or violence, is linked to mental health disorder development.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Witnessing domestic violence during childhood places individuals at a greater risk for developing psychological disorders such as depression.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; General functioning may be impacted in behavioral or emotional domains as a result of exposure to domestic violence as a child.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a widely supported potential resultant diagnosis of childhood trauma.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alisic|first=Eva|last2=Zalta|first2=Alyson K.|last3=Wesel|first3=Floryt van|last4=Larsen|first4=Sadie E.|last5=Hafstad|first5=Gertrud S.|last6=Hassanpour|first6=Katayun|last7=Smid|first7=Geert E.|date=2014-05-01|title=Rates of post-traumatic stress disorder in trauma-exposed children and adolescents: meta-analysis|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/204/5/335|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=204|issue=5|pages=335–340|doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.113.131227|issn=0007-1250|pmid=24785767}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, interpersonal trauma places children and adolescents at an increased risk for developing PTSD, with girls being the most susceptible.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Furthermore, exposure to bullying has also been shown to induce symptoms of PTSD or be connected to a PTSD diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Morten Birkeland|last2=Tangen|first2=Tone|last3=Idsoe|first3=Thormod|last4=Matthiesen|first4=Stig Berge|last5=Magerøy|first5=Nils|title=Post-traumatic stress disorder as a consequence of bullying at work and at school.

'''Curtis Eugene Chillingworth''' (October 24, 1896 to [[Declared death in absentia|presumably]] June 15, 1955) was a [[Florida]] [[Lawyer|attorney]] and state [[judge]] who [[Missing person|disappeared]] from his [[Manalapan, Florida]], home, and was later murdered along with his wife, Marjorie Chillingworth.

Their disappearances and deaths are recounted in the [[Investigation Discovery]] series ''[[A Crime to Remember]]'' (Season 1 Episode 3).

==Background==
Curtis Eugene Chillingworth was born October 24, 1896&lt;ref name=Newton2014/&gt; to a prominent [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] family.&lt;ref name=Tuckwood/&gt; He graduated from the [[University of Florida]] in 1917, and later that same year was admitted to the [[Florida Bar]]. After graduating, he served at the naval base in [[Key West, Florida]], then attended the [[United States Naval Academy]], where he received a commission to serve on the gunboat [[USS Annapolis (PG-10)|Annapolis]]. During [[World War I]] he served as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] aboard the [[USS Minneapolis (C-13)]].&lt;ref name=Newton2014/&gt;

After the war, he returned to West Palm Beach to practice law with his father. He married Marjorie M. McKinley, a [[Cornell University]] student and daughter of old friends of the Chillingworth family.

He remained in the U.S. Naval Reserves and was recalled to active duty in 1942. During World War II, he was stationed in London and Plymouth, England, where he participated in planning the occupation and recovery of Germany. He was released from active duty in 1945 as a full [[Commander]].

In 1921, at the age of 24, Chillingworth began his career as county judge. In 1923, he became the newly elected circuit judge, a position he held for 32 years until his death in 1955.

A {{convert|4.1|acre|m2|sing=on}} neighborhood park in West Palm Beach is named in honor of Chillingworth.&lt;ref name=WPB/&gt;

==Disappearance==
Chillingworth and his wife were last seen at a dinner in West Palm Beach, Florida, on the evening of June 14, 1955. They left the dinner about 10{{nbsp}}p.m. for their Manalapan home. They went to bed expecting a carpenter to arrive in the morning of June 15 to build a playground for their grandchildren.&lt;ref name=Wynne2014/&gt;

The carpenter arrived at 8{{nbsp}}a.m. and observed that the Chillingworths' door had been left open and that their home appeared to be empty. Later that same day, Judge Chillingworth failed to appear as scheduled at a 10{{nbsp}}a.m. hearing at the courthouse in West Palm Beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#THROWBACK THURSDAY — THE CHILLINGWORTHS &amp; 1955|url=http://crimefeed.com/2013/11/throwback-thursday-1955-chillinghams/|website=crimefeed.com|publisher=crimefeed.com|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police investigation==
An accidental drowning during a morning swim was quickly ruled out, and $40 found to be in Marjorie's pocketbook ruled out robbery.  The keys were still in the ignition of Chillingworth's Plymouth. No further clues were obtained and (at that point) the case went [[cold case (criminology)|cold]]. In 1957, Curtis and Marjorie Chillingworth were [[declared death in absentia|declared legally dead]].&lt;ref name=Newton2014/&gt; Several suspects were considered, including Charles Nelson, brother of Chillingworth's friend [[Trapper Nelson]], whose trial for murder Chillingworth had presided over.&lt;ref name=McIverSun/&gt;

===Judge Peel===
When in 1953 Joseph Peel represented both sides in a divorce, he was severely reprimanded by Chillingworth. In June 1955, Peel was slated to appear in court to answer charges of unethical conduct in yet another divorce case; [[disbarment]] was a possible consequence. At this point, Peel was using his position as an elected municipal judge to protect [[bolita]] operators and moonshiners by giving them advance warnings of raids in return for financial consideration. Disbarment would mean the loss of his position and therefore his lucrative illegal racket.&lt;ref name=McIverTropics/&gt;

By early June 1955, Peel was in a panic. The top legal officer in the county, Chillingworth, had already stated that Peel would get no second chance. Peel then hired Floyd "Lucky" Holzapfel (a known criminal and a carpenter's apprentice) to murder the Chillingworths. On the night of June 14, Holzapfel and an accomplice named Bobby Lincoln went to Manalapan and landed on the beach behind the Chillingworths' house around 1{{nbsp}}a.m. Bobby Lincoln crouched in the bushes as Holzapfel knocked on the door. The judge answered in his pajamas. Holzapfel pulled a pistol from under his shirt and forced the judge and his wife into the boat. After the boat drifted for about an hour, the couple were thrown overboard with lead weights strapped to their legs.&lt;ref name=Bishop/&gt;

In 1959, Holzapfel had bragged to a friend, James Yenzer, that he knew who had killed the Chillingworths, and in September 1960, Yenzer and a friend, ex-West Beach police officer Jim Wilber, lured Holzapfel to a hotel in [[Melbourne, Florida]]. Yenzer and Wilber managed to get Holzapfel drunk and discuss what he knew of the murders. Unbeknown to Holzapfel, a member of the Florida Sheriff's Bureau, tipped off by Yenzer and Wilber, was in an adjacent room in the hotel capturing his comments on tape.

===Arrests and convictions===
Holzapfel was arrested on October 1, 1960, and on December 12, 1960, he pleaded guilty to [[Double murder|both murders]]. He was sent to [[death row]], but his death sentence was commuted in 1966, and he died in prison thirty years later. On March 30, 1961, Peel was found guilty of [[accessory to murder]]. He received two [[life sentence]]s, but was paroled in 1982 while in seriously ill health, and died just nine days later. The [[accomplice]] to the murder, Bobby Lincoln, finished his federal prison term in [[Michigan]] in 1962.

[[File:Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup (Australian Open - Women's single).svg|thumb|right|100px|The Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup]]

'''Mitrice Lavon Richardson''' (born April 30, 1985{{spaced ndash}} remains found August 9, 2010) was a 24-year-old [[Americans|American]] woman who went missing on September 17, 2009 after being released from a [[Calabasas, California]] jail, where she had been taken after behaving erratically at a restaurant. She was subsequently found deceased 11 months later in August 2010.

Richardson's parents have maintained that their daughter should never have been released on her own by the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]], given her obviously disturbed condition. In 2011, they won civil lawsuits against the county of $900,000 in damages. In January 2017, the [[California Attorney General]]'s office concluded an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Richardson's release from jail and decided not to bring charges against anyone involved in her release.&lt;ref name=dailynews-jan2017&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20170131/mitrice-richardsons-family-speaks-out-as-state-says-deputies-shouldnt-be-prosecuted-in-her-death/|first=Susan|last=Abram| title=Mitrice Richardson's family speaks out as state says deputies shouldn’t be prosecuted in her death|date=2017-01-31|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Richardson was a graduate of [[South Hills High School (West Covina, California)|South Hills High School]] in [[West Covina, California|West Covina]], California. She graduated from [[California State University, Fullerton]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[psychology]] in 2008. She had been a [[beauty pageant]] contestant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blankstein| first1=Andrew |last2=Hall|first2= Carla | title = No Signs of Foul Play in Mitrice Richardson's Death, Authorities Say [Updated] | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 2010-08-12| url =http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/08/mitrice-richardson.html| accessdate =2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the daughter of Latice Sutton and Michael Richardson. She was raised by her mother and stepfather Larry Sutton in [[Covina, California|Covina]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1= Carla |last2=Rubin|first2= Joel | title =Mitrice Richardson May Have Been Spotted in Las Vegas| quote = Her parents, who have never been a couple, are divided on whether the new sightings are real.| newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]]| date = 2010-07-29| url =http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/29/local/la-me-0729-mitrice-20100729| accessdate =2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Kessler|first= Mike | title =What Happened to Mitrice Richardson?| quote = She knew Covina and the suburbs east of L.A., where she grew up with her mother and stepfather.

==Disappearance==
On the evening of September 16, 2009, Richardson entered the parking lot of Geoffrey's restaurant in Malibu. Due to what staff and patrons at the restaurant described as "bizarre" behavior and the fact that she was unable to pay her $89 bill, the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] from the Malibu/Lost Hills Station was called to assess her condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/13/local/la-me-mitrice-richardson-20100813|title=Long search for Mitrice Richardson comes to tragic end|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last1=Blankstein| first1=Andrew |last2=Hall|first2= Carla|accessdate=2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The officers on the scene purportedly administered a [[field sobriety test]] and determined that she was not intoxicated and not under the influence of any substance. She was arrested on charges of "suspicion of [[theft of services|not paying for the meal]]" and possession of less than an ounce of [[marijuana]].&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mitrice-richardson-arrested-released-then-disappeared-are-the-cops-to-blame/|title=Mitrice Richardson Arrested, Released, then Disappeared: Are the Cops to Blame?|date=2009-09-25 |work=cbsnews.com|accessdate=2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Advocate /&gt;&lt;ref name=lamag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/what-happened-to-mitrice-richardson/|title=What Happened To Mitrice Richardson |last =Kessler|first= Mike|work=[[Los Angeles (magazine)|Los Angeles]]|date=2011-09-01|accessdate=2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the arresting officers, upon her arrest, her phone, purse and money were secured in her car and her car was towed to a tow yard on the [[California State Route 1|Pacific Coast Highway]]. Richardson was detained and booked at the Malibu/Lost Hills Sheriff's Station approximately ten miles up [[Malibu Canyon]].

Although Richardson's mother informed the station of concern for her daughter's mental health, and despite promises from the station personnel that she would not be released until later in the morning, Richardson was released on September 17, 2009, at 12:28 AM with no belongings and no means of calling for assistance. Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, said Richardson was released from jail because "She exhibited no signs of mental illness or intoxication. She was fine. She's an adult."&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt;

Several hours later, at 6:30 AM, she was seen in the backyard of former [[KTLA]] news anchor [[Bill Smith (KTLA)|Bill Smith]] in [[Monte Nido, California|Monte Nido]]. When Smith opened his window and asked if she was OK, Richardson told Smith that she was "resting."&lt;ref name=lamag /&gt; Neighbors stated that they heard a woman's voice in the tennis courts of Smith's home. Others stated that they heard and saw Richardson either leaving or attempting to enter Smith's home and that she had been in the presence of a man who frequented the home for a few days after her disappearance. Neighbors also stated that they heard loud screams in a vacant home around the time that Richardson went missing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} They stated that the police were called.

==Searches==
[[File:Memorial to Mitrice Richardson.jpg|thumb|Site where Richardson's remains were found.]]
On January 9, 2010, four months after she was reported missing, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department conducted one of the largest-scale searches in the history of the department. Over 300 volunteers trained in [[search and rescue]] operations participated in the 18-square-mile search in the area of Malibu Canyon. The search included both air and ground searches of creeks, trails, and ridges. Richardson was not found during this search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Hall|first= Carla | title =Search for Mitrice Richardson Draws 300 Volunteers to Malibu, Canyon| newspaper =[[Los Angeles Times]]| date =2010-01-09| url =http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/01/search-for-mitrice-richardson-draws-300-volunteers-to-malibu-canyon.html| accessdate =2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maurice Dubois, father of slain [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], California, teen [[Amber Dubois]], assisted Richardson's family in a two-day search on June 5 and 6, 2010, in the [[Monte Nido, California|Monte Nido]], California, area of Malibu Canyon. Over 100 private-citizen volunteers participated in the search of the area. Although Richardson's remains were not discovered, searchers found racially and sexually offensive [[graffiti]] on the walls of a [[culvert]] in the canyon. The graffiti was freshly painted and paint cans, brushes and other potential evidence were left at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chapman|first= Justin | title =The Handwriting on the Wall| newspaper =[[Pasadena Weekly]]| date =2010-07-22| url=https://www.pasadenaweekly.com/2010/07/22/the-handwriting-on-the-wall/| accessdate =2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[creek bed]] in Malibu Canyon where Richardson's naked mummified remains were eventually discovered is adjacent to a 21-acre ranch that is known for producing pornography. It is very secluded and has direct access to the creek bed. When her body was discovered, the detectives on the case removed her body against the order of the [[coroner]]. Though residents reportedly heard screams in that area several nights after Richardson disappeared,&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.pasadenaweekly.com/2011/07/14/uncovering-the-truth/| title=Uncovering the truth|work=[[Pasadena Weekly]]| date=2011-07-14| accessdate=2018-11-07| first=Andre|last=Coleman}}&lt;/ref&gt; her death was deemed to not be a homicide; there was no [[Crime|foul play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1= Carla |last2=Blankstein|first2= Andrew | title =Long Search for Mitrice Richardson Comes to Tragic End | newspaper =[[Los Angeles Times]]| date =2010-08-13| url =http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/13/local/la-me-mitrice-richardson-20100813| accessdate =2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Duke|first= Alan | title =Remains Found in Malibu Canyon Identified as Mitrice Richardson| publisher =[[CNN]]| date = 2010-08-13| url =http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/08/12/california.remains.found/| accessdate =2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
Richardson's disappearance was covered on an episode of ''[[List of Disappeared episodes#Season 6 (2012–2013)|Disappeared]]'' on the [[Investigation Discovery]] channel, entitled "Lost in the Dark"; it first aired on November 19, 2012 as the Season 6 premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2849072/|title=Disappeared: Lost in the Dark|date=2012-11-19|accessdate=2018-11-07|publisher=[[IMDb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
Richardson's family has filed several lawsuits against the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for releasing her from jail even though, they claim, she was experiencing severe [[bipolar disorder]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Faturechi|first= Robert | title =Mitrice Richardson: $900,000 Settlement Tentatively Reached| newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 2011-08-23| url =http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/08/mitrice-richardson-settlement.html| accessdate =2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Salazar|first= Denise | title =Mother of Dead CSUF Grad Files Another Lawsuit | newspaper =[[Orange County Register]]| date = 2011-05-25| url =http://www.ocregister.com/articles/richardson-301952-malibu-remains.html| accessdate =2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, her parents, who had sued separately, were awarded $450,000 each.&lt;ref name="2016 LA Daily News story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Abram|first=Susan|title=California attorney general opens criminal investigation into Sheriff's Department over Mitrice Richardson case|url=http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20160212/california-attorney-general-opens-criminal-investigation-into-sheriffs-department-over-mitrice-richardson-case|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=2016-02-02 |accessdate=2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson's girlfriend, Tessa Moon, refutes claims that Richardson had any mental illness.&lt;ref name=Advocate /&gt;

Richardson's family also asked the [[Attorney General of California|California Attorney General]]'s office to review the sheriff's office's handling of the case. In November 2015, after reviewing 500 pages of documents sent with the request, the office of California then-Attorney General [[Kamala Harris]] replied that it had not found any grounds for criminal charges against the sheriff or his deputies. The Attorney General's office also found no evidence that the sheriff's office had mishandled Richardson's family's complaint against it. However, in January 2016, the California Attorney General's office reversed itself and announced it was beginning a criminal investigation of the case.&lt;ref name="2016 LA Daily News story" /&gt;

On December 30, 2016, the California Attorney General's office concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support criminal prosecution of anyone involved in the handling of the case.&lt;ref name=dailynews-jan2017 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37440">'''Description logics''' ('''DL''') are a family of formal [[knowledge representation]] languages. Many DLs are more expressive than [[propositional logic]] but less expressive than [[first-order logic]]. In contrast to the latter, the core reasoning problems for DLs are (usually) [[Decision problem|decidable]], and efficient decision procedures have been designed and implemented for these problems. There are general, spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, and fuzzy descriptions logics, and each description logic features a different balance between DL expressivity and [[Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning|reasoning]] [[Complexity_class|complexity]] by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=2017 |title=Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |isbn=978-3-319-54066-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DLs are used in [[artificial intelligence]] to describe and reason about the relevant concepts of an application domain (known as ''terminological knowledge''). It is of particular importance in providing a logical formalism for [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] and the [[Semantic Web]]: the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) and its profile is based on DLs. The most notable application of DLs and OWL is in [[biomedical informatics]] where DL assists in the codification of biomedical knowledge.

==Introduction==
A description logic (DL) models ''concepts'', ''roles'' and ''individuals'', and their relationships.

The fundamental modeling concept of a DL is the ''axiom''—a logical statement relating roles and/or concepts.&lt;ref name="GHMPPS"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grau | first1 = B. C.  | last2 = Horrocks | first2 = I. | authorlink2 = Ian Horrocks| last3 = Motik | first3 = B. | last4 = Parsia | first4 = B. | last5 = Patel-Schneider | first5 = P.

==Nomenclature==
===Terminology compared to FOL and OWL===
The description logic community uses different terminology than the [[first-order logic]] (FOL) community for operationally equivalent notions; some examples are given below. The [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) uses again a different terminology, also given in the table below.

===Naming convention===
There are many varieties of description logics and there is an informal naming convention, roughly describing the operators allowed. The [[Expressive power (computer science)|expressivity]] is encoded in the label for a logic starting with one of the following basic logics:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{AL}&lt;/math&gt; ||Attributive language. This is the base language which allows:
|-
| ||
* Atomic negation (negation of concept names that do not appear on the left-hand side of axioms)
* Concept intersection
* Universal restrictions
* Limited existential quantification
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FL}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Frame based description language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levesque | first1 = Hector J. | author1-link = Hector Levesque | last2 = Brachmann | first2 = Ronald J. | author2-link = Ronald Brachman | title = Expressiveness and tractability in knowledge representation and reasoning | journal = Computational Intelligence | year = 1987 | number = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows:
|-
| ||
* Concept intersection
* Universal restrictions
* Limited existential quantification
* Role restriction
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{EL}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Existential language, allows:
|-
| ||
* Concept intersection
* Existential restrictions (of full existential quantification)
|}
Followed by any of the following extensions:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Functional properties, a special case of [[uniqueness quantification]].
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Full existential qualification (existential restrictions that have fillers other than &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;).
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Concept union.
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Complex concept negation.
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Role hierarchy (subproperties: &lt;code&gt;rdfs:subPropertyOf&lt;/code&gt;).
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Limited complex role inclusion axioms; reflexivity and irreflexivity; role disjointness.
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Nominals. (Enumerated classes of object value restrictions: &lt;code&gt;owl:oneOf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;owl:hasValue&lt;/code&gt;).
|-

|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Inverse properties.

====Examples====
As an example, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; is a centrally important description logic from which comparisons with other varieties can be made. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; is simply &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{AL}&lt;/math&gt; with complement of any concept allowed, not just atomic concepts. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; is used instead of the equivalent &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALUE}&lt;/math&gt;.

A further example, the description logic &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SHIQ}&lt;/math&gt; is the logic &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; plus  extended cardinality restrictions, and transitive and inverse roles. The naming conventions aren't purely systematic so that the logic &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALCOIN}&lt;/math&gt; might be referred to as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALCNIO}&lt;/math&gt; and abbreviations are made where possible,

The Protégé ontology editor supports &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SHOIN}^\mathcal{(D)}&lt;/math&gt;. Three major biomedical informatics terminology bases, [[SNOMED CT]], GALEN, and GO, are expressible in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{EL}&lt;/math&gt; (with additional role properties).

OWL 2 provides the expressiveness of  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SROIQ}^\mathcal{(D)}&lt;/math&gt;, OWL-DL is based on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SHOIN}^\mathcal{(D)}&lt;/math&gt;, and for OWL-Lite it is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SHIF}^\mathcal{(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==History==
Description logic was given its current name in the 1980s. Previous to this it was called (chronologically): ''terminological systems'', and ''concept languages''.

===Knowledge representation===
[[semantic frames|Frame]]s and [[semantic network]]s lack formal (logic-based) semantics.&lt;ref name="DLHB"&gt;Franz Baader, Ian Horrocks, and Ulrike Sattler ''Chapter 3 Description Logics''. In Frank van Harmelen, Vladimir Lifschitz, and Bruce Porter, editors, ''Handbook of Knowledge Representation''. Elsevier, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; DL was first introduced into [[knowledge representation]] (KR) systems to overcome this deficiency.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

The first DL-based KR system was [[KL-ONE]] (by [[Ronald J. Brachman]] and Schmolze, 1985). During the '80s other DL-based systems using ''structural subsumption algorithms''&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; were developed including KRYPTON (1983), [[LOOM (ontology)|LOOM]] (1987), BACK (1988), K-REP (1991) and CLASSIC (1991). This approach featured DL with limited expressiveness but relatively efficient (polynomial time) reasoning.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

In the early '90s, the introduction of a new ''tableau based algorithm'' paradigm allowed efficient reasoning on more expressive DL.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; DL-based systems using these algorithms - such as KRIS (1991) - show acceptable reasoning performance on typical inference problems even though the worst case complexity is no longer polynomial.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

From the mid '90s, reasoners were created with good practical performance on very expressive DL with high worst case complexity.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; Examples from this period include FaCT,&lt;ref name="fact"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Tsarkov | first1 = D. | last2 = Horrocks | first2 = I. | chapter = FaCT++ Description Logic Reasoner: System Description | doi = 10.1007/11814771_26 | url = http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ian.horrocks/Publications/download/2006/TsHo06a.pdf| title = Automated Reasoning | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume = 4130 | pages = 292–297 | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-3-540-37187-8 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RACER system|RACER]] (2001), CEL (2005), and [[KAON|KAON 2]] (2005).

==Modeling==
In DL, a distinction is drawn between the so-called [[Tbox|TBox]] (terminological box) and the [[Abox|ABox]] (assertional box). In general, the TBox contains sentences describing concept hierarchies (i.e., relations between [[concept]]s) while the ABox contains [[ground sentence]]s stating where in the hierarchy individuals belong (i.e., relations between individuals and concepts). For example, the statement:

{{NumBlk|:|Every employee is a person|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

belongs in the TBox, while the statement:

{{NumBlk|:|Bob is an employee|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

belongs in the ABox.

Note that the TBox/ABox distinction is not significant, in the same sense that the two "kinds" of sentences are not treated differently in first-order logic (which subsumes most DL). When translated into first-order logic, a subsumption [[axiom]] like ({{EquationNote|1}}) is simply a conditional restriction to [[unary operation|unary]] [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]]s (concepts) with only variables appearing in it. Clearly, a sentence of this form is not privileged or special over sentences in which only constants ("grounded" values) appear like ({{EquationNote|2}}).

So why was the distinction introduced? The primary reason is that the separation can be useful when describing and formulating decision-procedures for various DL. For example, a reasoner might process the TBox and ABox separately, in part because certain key inference problems are tied to one but not the other one ('classification' is related to the TBox, 'instance checking' to the ABox). Another example is that the complexity of the TBox can greatly affect the performance of a given decision-procedure for a certain DL, independently of the ABox. Thus, it is useful to have a way to talk about that specific part of the [[knowledge base]].

The secondary reason is that the distinction can make sense from the knowledge base modeler's perspective. It is plausible to distinguish between our conception of terms/concepts in the world (class axioms in the TBox) and particular manifestations of those terms/concepts (instance assertions in the ABox). In the above example: when the hierarchy within a company is the same in every branch but the assignment to employees is different in every department (because there are other people working there), it makes sense to reuse the TBox for different branches that do not use the same ABox.

There are two features of description logic that are not shared by most other data description formalisms: DL does not make the [[Unique name assumption]] (UNA) or the [[Closed-world assumption]] (CWA). Not having UNA means that two concepts with different names may be allowed by some inference to be shown to be equivalent. Not having CWA, or rather having the [[Open world assumption]] (OWA) means that lack of knowledge of a fact does not immediately imply knowledge of the negation of a fact.

==Formal description==
Like [[first-order logic]] (FOL), a [[Syntax (logic)|syntax]] defines which collections of symbols are legal expressions in a description logic, and [[semantics]] determine meaning. Unlike FOL, a DL may have several well known syntactic variants.&lt;ref name="HS"/&gt;

===Syntax===
The syntax of a member of the description logic family is characterized by its recursive definition, in which the constructors that can be used to form concept terms are stated. Some constructors are related to logical constructors in [[first-order logic]] (FOL) such as ''[[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]'' or ''[[logical conjunction|conjunction]]'' of concepts, ''[[union (set theory)|union]]'' or ''[[disjunction]]'' of concepts, ''[[negation]]'' or ''[[complement (set theory)|complement]]'' of concepts, ''[[Universal quantifier|universal restriction]]'' and ''[[Existential quantifier|existential restriction]]''. Other constructors have no corresponding construction in FOL including restrictions on roles for example, inverse, [[transitive relation|transitivity]] and functionality.

====Notation====
Let C and D be concepts, a and b be individuals, and R be a role.

If a is R-related to b, then b is called an R-successor of a.

====The description logic ALC====
The prototypical DL ''Attributive Concept Language with Complements'' (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt;) was introduced by Manfred Schmidt-Schauß and Gert Smolka in 1991, and is the basis of many more expressive DLs.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; The following definitions follow the treatment in Baader et al.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;N_C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_O&lt;/math&gt;  be (respectively) [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of ''concept names'' (also known as ''atomic concepts''), ''role names'' and ''individual names'' (also known as ''individuals'', ''nominals'' or ''objects''). Then the ordered triple (&lt;math&gt;N_C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_O&lt;/math&gt;) is the ''signature''.

=====Concepts=====
The set of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; ''concepts'' is the smallest set such that:

* The following are ''concepts'':
** &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; (''top'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; (''bottom'' is a ''concept'')
** Every &lt;math&gt;A \in N_C&lt;/math&gt; (all ''atomic concepts'' are ''concepts'')
* If &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are ''concepts'' and &lt;math&gt;R \in N_R&lt;/math&gt; then the following are ''concepts'':
** &lt;math&gt;C\sqcap D&lt;/math&gt; (the intersection of two ''concepts'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;C\sqcup D&lt;/math&gt; (the union of two ''concepts'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;\neg C&lt;/math&gt; (the complement of a ''concept'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;\forall R.C&lt;/math&gt; (the universal restriction of a ''concept'' by a ''role'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;\exists R.C&lt;/math&gt; (the existential restriction of a ''concept'' by a ''role'' is a ''concept'')

=====Terminological axioms=====
A ''general concept inclusion'' (GCI) has the form &lt;math&gt;C \sqsubseteq D&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are ''concepts''. Write &lt;math&gt;C \equiv D&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;C \sqsubseteq D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D \sqsubseteq C&lt;/math&gt;. A ''TBox'' is any finite set of GCIs.

=====Assertional axioms=====
{{Anchor|concept_assertion}}
* A ''concept assertion'' is a statement of the form &lt;math&gt;a : C&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;a \in N_O&lt;/math&gt; and C is a ''concept''.
* A ''role assertion'' is a statement of the form &lt;math&gt;(a,b) : R&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a, b \in N_O&lt;/math&gt;  and R is a ''role''.

An ''ABox'' is a finite set of assertional axioms.

=====Knowledge base=====
A ''knowledge base'' (KB) is an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; for [[Tbox|TBox]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; and [[Abox|ABox]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Semantics===
The [[semantics]] of description logics are defined by interpreting concepts as sets of individuals and roles as sets of ordered pairs of individuals. Those individuals are typically assumed from a given domain. The semantics of non-atomic concepts and roles is then defined in terms of atomic concepts and roles. This is done by using a recursive definition similar to the syntax.

====The description logic ALC====
The following definitions follow the treatment in Baader et al.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

A ''terminological interpretation'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}=(\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}, \cdot^{\mathcal{I}})&lt;/math&gt; over a ''signature'' &lt;math&gt;(N_C,N_R,N_O)&lt;/math&gt; consists of
* a non-empty set &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt; called the [[domain of discourse|''domain'']]
* a ''interpretation function'' &lt;math&gt;\cdot^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt; that maps:
** every ''individual'' &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to an element &lt;math&gt;a^{\mathcal{I}} \in \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
** every ''concept'' to a subset of &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
** every ''role name'' to a subset of &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}  \times \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
such that
* &lt;math&gt;\top^{\mathcal{I}} = \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\bot^{\mathcal{I}} = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(C \sqcup D)^{\mathcal{I}} = C^{\mathcal{I}} \cup D^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt; ''([[union (set theory)|union]] means [[disjunction]])''
* &lt;math&gt;(C \sqcap D)^{\mathcal{I}} = C^{\mathcal{I}} \cap D^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt; ''([[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] means [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]])''
* &lt;math&gt;(\neg C)^{\mathcal{I}} = \Delta^{\mathcal{I}} \setminus C^{\mathcal{I}} &lt;/math&gt; ''([[complement (set theory)|complement]] means [[negation]])''
* &lt;math&gt;(\forall R.C)^{\mathcal{I}} = \{x \in \Delta^{\mathcal{I}} | \text{for} \; \text{every} \; y, (x,y) \in R^{\mathcal{I}} \;  \text{implies} \; y \in C^{\mathcal{I}} \} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(\exists R.C)^{\mathcal{I}} = \{x \in \Delta^{\mathcal{I}} | \text{there} \; \text{exists} \; y, (x,y) \in R^{\mathcal{I}} \; \text{and} \; y \in C^{\mathcal{I}}\} &lt;/math&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models&lt;/math&gt; (read ''in I holds'') as follows

=====TBox=====
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models C \sqsubseteq D&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;C^{\mathcal{I}} \subseteq D^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \Phi&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\Phi \in \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;

=====ABox=====
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models a : C&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a^{\mathcal{I}} \in C^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models (a,b) : R&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;(a^{\mathcal{I}},b^{\mathcal{I}}) \in R^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \phi&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\phi \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;

=====Knowledge base=====
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K} = (\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; be a knowledge base.

* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;

==Inference==
===Decision problems===
In addition to the ability to describe concepts formally, one also would like to employ the description of a set of concepts to ask questions about the concepts and instances described. The most common decision problems are basic database-query-like questions like ''instance checking'' (is a particular instance (member of an A-box) a member of a given concept) and ''relation checking'' (does a relation/role hold between two instances, in other words does '''a''' have property '''b'''), and the more global-database-questions like ''subsumption'' (is a concept a subset of another concept), and ''concept consistency'' (is there no contradiction among the definitions or chain of definitions). The more operators one includes in a logic and the more complicated the T-box (having cycles, allowing non-atomic concepts to include each other), usually the higher the computational complexity is for each of these problems (see [http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~ezolin/dl/ Description Logic Complexity Navigator] for examples).

==Relationship with other logics==
===First-order logic===
Many DLs are [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] [[fragment (logic)|fragments]] of [[first-order logic]] (FOL)&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; and are usually fragments of [[two-variable logic]] or [[guarded logic]]. In addition, some DLs have features that are not covered in FOL; this includes ''concrete domains'' (such as integer or strings, which can be used as ranges for roles such as ''hasAge'' or ''hasName'') or an operator on roles for the transitive closure of that role.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

===Fuzzy description logic===
Fuzzy description logics combines [[fuzzy logic]] with DLs. Since many concepts that are needed for [[Artificial intelligence|intelligent systems]] lack well defined boundaries, or precisely defined criteria of membership, fuzzy logic is needed to deal with notions of vagueness and imprecision. This offers a motivation for a generalization of description logic towards dealing with imprecise and vague concepts.

===Modal logic===
Description logic is related to—but developed independently of—[[modal logic]] (ML).&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; Many—but not all—DL are syntactic variants of ML.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

In general, an object corresponds to a [[Kripke semantics|possible world]], a concept corresponds to a modal proposition, and a role-bounded quantifier to a modal operator with that role as its accessibility relation.

Operations on roles (such as composition, inversion, etc.) correspond to the modal operations used in [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]].&lt;ref name=CTTL&gt;{{cite web|last=Schild|first=Klaus|title=Correspondence theory for terminological logics: Preliminary Report|url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~ezolin/dl/bib/Correspondence_theory_for_terminological_logics_%28IJCAI_1991%29.pdf|work=KIT Report 91|publisher=KIT-BACK|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CTTL"/&gt;

===Temporal description logic===
Temporal description logic represents—and allows reasoning about—time dependent concepts and many different approaches to this problem exist.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Artale and Enrico Franconi "Temporal Description Logics". In "Handbook of Temporal Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence", 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a description logic might be combined with a [[modal logic|modal]] [[temporal logic]] such as [[linear temporal logic]].

[[File:Desire to Climb.jpg|thumb|right|A toddler having a desire to climb.]]
'''Desire''' is a sense of '''longing''' or hoping for a person, object, or outcome. The same sense is expressed by [[emotion]]s such as "'''craving'''". When a person desires something or someone, their sense of longing is excited by the enjoyment or the thought of the item or person, and they [[incentive salience|want]] to take actions to obtain their goal. The motivational aspect of desire has long been noted by philosophers; [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) asserted that human desire is the fundamental motivation of all human action.

While desires are often classified as emotions by laypersons, [[Psychology|psychologists]] often describe desires as different from emotions; psychologists tend to argue that desires arise from bodily structures, such as the stomach's need for food, whereas emotions arise from a person's mental state. [[Marketing]] and advertising companies have used psychological research on how desire is stimulated to find more effective ways to induce consumers into buying a given product or service. While some advertising attempts to give buyers a sense of lack or wanting, other types of advertising create desire associating the product with desirable attributes, by showing either a celebrity or a model with the product.

The theme of desire is at the core of [[romance (heroic literature)|romance]] novels, which often create drama by showing cases where human desire is impeded by [[social convention]]s, [[Social class|class]], or cultural barriers. The theme of desire is also used in other literary genres, such as Gothic novels (e.g., ''[[Dracula]]'' by [[Bram Stoker]], in which desire is mingled with fear and dread). Poets ranging from [[Homer]] to [[Toni Morrison]] have dealt with the theme of desire in their work. Just as desire is central to the written fiction genre of romance, it is the central theme of [[melodrama]] films, which use plots that appeal to the heightened emotions of the audience by showing "crises of human emotion, failed romance or friendship", in which desire is thwarted or unrequited.

==In philosophy==
{{Main article|Philosophy of desire}}
[[File:Almeida Júnior - Saudade (Longing) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Saudade]]'' (1899), by [[José Ferraz de Almeida Júnior]]]]

In philosophy, desire has been identified as a philosophical problem since Antiquity. In [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']], [[Plato]] argues that individual desires must be postponed in the name of the higher ideal. In ''[[De Anima]]'', [[Aristotle]] claims that desire is implicated in animal interactions and the propensity of animals to motion; at the same time, he acknowledges that reasoning also interacts with desire.

Hobbes (1588–1679) proposed the concept of [[psychological hedonism]], which asserts that the "fundamental motivation of all human action is the desire for pleasure." [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–1677) had a view which contrasted with Hobbes, in that "he saw natural desires as a form of bondage" that are not chosen by a person of their own [[free will]]. [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) claimed that desires and passions are non-cognitive, automatic bodily responses, and he argued that reasoning is "capable only of devising means to ends set by [bodily] desire".&lt;ref&gt;Ethics Chapter. ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' CD-ROM, V. 1.0, London: Routledge Edward Craig (ed). "Morality and emotions". By Martha C. Nussbaum&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) called any action based on desires a [[hypothetical imperative]], meaning by this that it is a command of reason that applies only if one desires the goal in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/159208/desire#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=desire%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia|title=desire - behaviour|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant also established a relation between the beautiful and pleasure in ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] claimed that "self-consciousness is desire".

Because desire can cause humans to become obsessed and embittered, it has been called one of the causes of woe for mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, Steve. ''Buddhism Plain and Simple''. New York: Broadway Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the teachings of Buddhism, [[tanha|craving]] is thought to be the cause of all [[dukkha|suffering]] that one experiences in human existence. The eradication of craving leads one to ultimate happiness, or [[Nirvana]]. However, desire for wholesome things is seen as liberating and enhancing.&lt;ref&gt;Charles S. Prebish, and Damien Keown, ''Buddhism - the EBook.'' Journal of Buddhist Ethics Online Books, 2005, page 83.&lt;/ref&gt; While the stream of desire for sense-pleasures must be cut eventually, a practitioner on the path to liberation is encouraged by the Buddha to "generate desire" for the fostering of skillful qualities and the abandoning of unskillful ones.&lt;ref name="this section"/&gt;

==In religion==
In [[Hinduism]], the Rig Veda's creation myth [[Nasadiya Sukta]] states regarding the one (ekam) spirit: "In the beginning there was Desire (kama) that was first seed of mind. Poets found the bond of being in non-being in their heart's thought".

In [[Buddhism]], for an individual to effect his or her liberation, the flow of sense-desire must be cut completely; however, while training, he or she must work with motivational processes based on skillfully applied desire.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Collins, ''Selfless Persons: Thought and Imagery in [[Theravada]] Buddhism''. Cambridge University Press, 1982, page 251: "In the end, the flowing streams of sense-desire must be 'cut' or 'crossed' completely; nevertheless, for the duration of the Path, a monk must perforce work with motivational and perceptual processes as they ordinarily are, that is to say, based on desire ... Thus, during mental training, the stream is not to be 'cut' immediately, but guided, like water along viaducts. The meditative steadying of the mind by counting in- and out-breaths (in the mindfulness of breathing) is compared to the steadying of a boat in 'a fierce current' by its rudder. The disturbance of the flow of a mountain stream by irrigation channels cut into its sides it used to illustrate the weakening of insight by the [[Five hindrances|five 'hindrances']]."&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Pāli Canon|early Buddhist scriptures]], the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] stated that monks should "generate desire" for the sake of fostering skillful qualities and abandoning unskillful ones.&lt;ref name="this section"&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, "[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part2.html#part2-c The Wings to Awakening]".&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a double message here between what Buddha said, that desire must be created, and what some monks propose to their followers, that desire must be cut.
Truth is Buddhism entails two aspects: the ideas monks taught to civilize peasantry, on the one hand, and the esoteric teachings of tantra (aimed at leaders) for self-realization, on the other, where—just as Buddha said—desire must be generated.
Dr. [[Oscar R. Gómez]] holds that teachings imparted privately by H.H. [[14th Dalai Lama]] are meant for leaders to be able to choose a specific desire consciously by creating it previously from the inside. People have a tendency to live based on desires coming from the outside, and such desires are the ones making choices for them. As an alternative, tantric Tibetan Buddhism allows to choose a desire consciously; to create desire rather than being created by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gómez|first=Oscar R.|title=Manual of Tantra Vol III ...from tantra to the technology of desire|year=2009|publisher=''Editorial Menteclara''|isbn=978-987-24510-2-8|page=|edition=}} Read at: [https://www.academia.edu/19309143/Manual_de_Tantra_-_...desde_el_tantra_a_la_Tecnolog%C3%ADa_del_deseo_ Academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity, desire is seen as something that can either lead a person towards God and destiny or away from him. Desire is not considered to be a bad thing in and of itself; rather, it is a powerful force within the human that, once submitted to the Lordship of Christ, can become a tool for good, for advancement, and for abundant living.

===Neuropsychology===
{{main|Motivational salience}}
While desires are often classified as emotions by laypersons, psychologists often describe desires as different from emotions. For psychologists, desires arise from bodily structures and functions (e.g., the stomach needing food and the blood needing oxygen). On the other hand, emotions arise from a person's mental state. A 2008 study by the [[University of Michigan]] indicated that, while humans experience desire and [[fear]] as psychological opposites, they share the same brain circuit.&lt;ref&gt;"Changing stress levels can make brain flip from 'desire' to 'dread{{'"}}.  Mar. 19, 2008
http://www.ns.umich.edu/htdocs/releases/story.php?id=6419&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study entitled "The Neural Correlates of Desire" showed that the human brain categorizes stimuli according to its desirability by activating three different brain areas: the superior [[orbitofrontal cortex]], the mid-[[cingulate cortex]], and the [[anterior cingulate cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kawabata H, Zeki S | year = 2008 | title = The Neural Correlates of Desire | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 3 | issue = 8| page = e3027 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0003027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{npsn|date=September 2016}}

In [[affective neuroscience]], "desire" and "wanting" are operationally defined as [[motivational salience]];&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schultz W | year = 2015 | title = Neuronal reward and decision signals: from theories to data | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 853–951 | pmid = 26109341 | pmc = 4491543 | doi=10.1152/physrev.00023.2014 | quote = Rewards in operant conditioning are positive reinforcers.&amp;nbsp;... Operant behavior gives a good definition for rewards. Anything that makes an individual come back for more is a positive reinforcer and therefore a reward. Although it provides a good definition, positive reinforcement is only one of several reward functions.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards are attractive. They are motivating and make us exert an effort.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards induce approach behavior, also called appetitive or preparatory behavior, and consummatory behavior.&amp;nbsp;... Thus any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward.&amp;nbsp;... Rewarding stimuli, objects, events, situations, and activities consist of several major components. First, rewards have basic sensory components (visual, auditory, somatosensory, gustatory, and olfactory)&amp;nbsp;... Second, rewards are salient and thus elicit attention, which are manifested as orienting responses (FIGURE 1, middle). The salience of rewards derives from three principal factors, namely, their physical intensity and impact (physical salience), their novelty and surprise (novelty/surprise salience), and their general motivational impact shared with punishers (motivational salience). A separate form not included in this scheme, incentive salience, primarily addresses dopamine function in addiction and refers only to approach behavior (as opposed to learning)&amp;nbsp;... These emotions are also called liking (for pleasure) and wanting (for desire) in addiction research (471) and strongly support the learning and approach generating functions of reward.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAcc function"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | pages = 147–148, 367, 376 | edition = 2nd | quote= VTA DA neurons play a critical role in motivation, reward-related behavior (Chapter 15), attention, and multiple forms of memory. This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (“wanting”) on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the form of "desire" or "wanting" associated with a [[rewarding stimulus]] (i.e., a stimulus which acts as a [[positive reinforcer]], such as [[Palatability|palatable food]], an attractive mate, or an [[addictive drug]]) is called "[[incentive salience]]" and research has demonstrated that incentive salience, the sensation of [[pleasure]], and [[positive reinforcement]] are all derived from [[neuron]]al activity within the [[reward system]].&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM Reward System" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system" /&gt; Studies have shown that [[dopamine]] [[signal transduction|signaling]] in the [[nucleus accumbens shell]] and [[endogenous opioid]] signaling in the [[ventral pallidum]] are at least partially responsible for mediating an individual's desire (i.e., incentive salience) for a rewarding stimulus and the subjective perception of pleasure derived from experiencing or "consuming" a rewarding stimulus (e.g., pleasure derived from eating palatable food, sexual pleasure from intercourse with an attractive mate, or [[euphoriant|euphoria from using an addictive drug]]).&lt;ref name="NAcc function" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM Reward System"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 365–366, 376 | chapter = Chapter 15: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders | edition = 2nd | quote= The neural substrates that underlie the perception of reward and the phenomenon of positive reinforcement are a set of interconnected forebrain structures called brain reward pathways; these include the nucleus accumbens (NAc; the major component of the ventral striatum), the basal forebrain (components of which have been termed the extended amygdala, as discussed later in this chapter), hippocampus, hypothalamus, and frontal regions of cerebral cortex. These structures receive rich dopaminergic innervation from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain. Addictive drugs are rewarding and reinforcing because they act in brain reward pathways to enhance either dopamine release or the effects of dopamine in the NAc or related structures, or because they produce effects similar to dopamine.&amp;nbsp;... A macrostructure postulated to integrate many of the functions of this circuit is described by some investigators as the extended amygdala. The extended amygdala is said to comprise several basal forebrain structures that share similar morphology, immunocytochemical features, and connectivity and that are well suited to mediating aspects of reward function; these include the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the central medial amygdala, the shell of the NAc, and the sublenticular substantia innominata.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML | title = Pleasure systems in the brain | journal = Neuron | volume = 86 | issue = 3 | pages = 646–664 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25950633 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018 | quote = In the prefrontal cortex, recent evidence indicates that the OFC and insula cortex may each contain their own additional hot spots (D.C. Castro et al., Soc. Neurosci., abstract). In specific subregions of each area, either opioid-stimulating or orexin-stimulating microinjections appear to enhance the number of ‘‘liking’’ reactions elicited by sweetness, similar to the NAc and VP hot spots. Successful confirmation of hedonic hot spots in the OFC or insula would be important and possibly relevant to the orbitofrontal mid-anterior site mentioned earlier that especially tracks the subjective pleasure of foods in humans (Georgiadis et al., 2012; Kringelbach, 2005; Kringelbach et al., 2003; Small et al., 2001; Veldhuizen et al., 2010). Finally, in the brainstem, a hindbrain site near the parabrachial nucleus of dorsal pons also appears able to contribute to hedonic gains of function (Söderpalm and Berridge, 2000). A brainstem mechanism for pleasure may seem more surprising than forebrain hot spots to anyone who views the brainstem as merely reflexive, but the pontine parabrachial nucleus contributes to taste, pain, and many visceral sensations from the body and has also been suggested to play an important role in motivation (Wu et al., 2012) and in human emotion (especially related to the somatic marker hypothesis) (Damasio, 2010). | pmc=4425246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Euphoria + pleasure circuitry"&gt;{{cite book | author=Kringelbach ML, Berridge KC | title=From Abuse to Recovery: Understanding Addiction | pages=199–207 | chapter=The Joyful Mind | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ITeFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT199&amp;q=euphoria#v=onepage&amp;q=euphoria&amp;f=false | accessdate=8 April 2016 | date=2013 | publisher=Macmillan | isbn=9781466842557 | quote = So it makes sense that the real pleasure centers in the brain—those directly responsible for generating pleasurable sensations—turn out to lie within some of the structures previously identified as part of the reward circuit.

The rewarding effects of drugs of abuse, development of incentive salience, and development of drug-seeking habits in the binge/intoxication stage involve changes in dopamine and opioid peptides in the basal ganglia. The increases in negative emotional states and dysphoric and stress-like responses in the withdrawal/negative affect stage involve decreases in the function of the dopamine component of the reward system and recruitment of brain stress neurotransmitters, such as corticotropin-releasing factor and dynorphin, in the neurocircuitry of the extended amygdala. The craving and deficits in executive function in the so-called preoccupation/anticipation stage involve the dysregulation of key afferent projections from the prefrontal cortex and insula, including glutamate, to the basal ganglia and extended amygdala.

===Psychiatry===
Austrian psychiatrist [[Sigmund Freud]], who is best known for his theories of the unconscious mind and the defense mechanism of repression and for creating the clinical practice of psychoanalysis, proposed the notion of the [[Oedipus complex]], which argues that desire for the mother creates neuroses in their sons. Freud used the Greek myth of [[Oedipus]] to argue that people desire incest and must repress that desire. He claimed that children pass through several stages, including a stage in which they fixate on the mother as a sexual object.
That this "complex" is universal has long since been disputed.  Even if it were true, that would not explain those neuroses in daughters, but only in sons.  While it is true that sexual confusion ''can'' be aberrative in a few cases, there is no credible evidence to suggest that it is a universal scenario.  While Freud was correct in labeling the various symptoms behind most compulsions, phobias and disorders, he was largely incorrect in his theories regarding the [[etiology]] of what he identified.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= http://www.iep.utm.edu/freud/ | title = Sigmund Freud (1856—1939) | publisher = The University of Tennessee, Martin | date  =  March 11, 2012| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French psychoanalyst and psychiatrist [[Jacques Lacan]] (1901–1981) argues that desire first occurs during a "mirror phase" of a baby's development, when the baby sees an image of wholeness in a mirror which gives them a desire for that being. As a person matures, Lacan claims that they still feel separated from themselves by language, which is incomplete, and so a person continually strives to become whole. He uses the term "[[jouissance]]" to refer to the lost object or feeling of absence which a person believes to be unobtainable. For more details on the Lacanian conception of desire, see [[desire (psychoanalysis)]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= https://books.google.com.ng/books?isbn=020348732X | title = A Systemic Perspective on Cognition and Mathematics | publisher = Lin Forrest Publishers | date  =  June 30, 2013| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In marketing==
In the field of [[marketing]], desire is the human appetite for a given object of attention. Desire for a product is stimulated by advertising, which attempts to give buyers a sense of lack or wanting. In store retailing, merchants attempt to increase the desire of the buyer by showcasing the product attractively, in the case of clothes or jewellery, or, for food stores, by offering samples. With print, TV, and radio advertising, desire is created by giving the potential buyer a sense of lacking ("Are you still driving that old car?") or by associating the product with desirable attributes, either by showing a celebrity using or wearing the product, or by giving the product a "halo effect" by showing attractive models with the product. Nike's "Just Do It" ads for sports shoes are appealing to consumers' desires for self-betterment.

In some cases, the potential buyer already has the desire for the product before they enter the store, as in the case of a decorating buff entering their favorite furniture store. The role of the salespeople in these cases is simply to guide the customer towards making a choice; they do not have to try to "sell" the general idea of making a purchase, because the customer already wants the products. In other cases, the potential buyer does not have a desire for the product or service, and so the company has to create the sense of desire. An example of this situation is for life insurance. Most young adults are not thinking about dying, so they are not naturally thinking about how they need to have accidental death insurance. Life insurance companies, though, are attempting to create a desire for life insurance with advertising that shows pictures of children and asks "If anything happens to you, who will pay for the children's upkeep?".{{cn|date=February 2016}}

Marketing theorists call desire the third stage in the hierarchy of effects, which occurs when the buyer develops a sense that if they felt the need for the type of product in question, the advertised product is what would quench their desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914043251/http://www.marketing.org.au/default.aspx?i=o7/3rRJaaY0=&amp;t=jZS6ngCVPug=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction and art==
===Written fiction===
The theme of desire is at the core of the romance novel. Novels which are based around the theme of desire, which can range from a long aching feeling to an unstoppable torrent, include ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' by [[Gustave Flaubert]]; ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]'' by [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]]; ''[[Lolita]]'' by [[Vladimir Nabokov]]; ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' by Charlotte Brontë, and ''[[Dracula]]'' by [[Bram Stoker]]. Brontë's characterization of Jane Eyre depicts her as torn by an inner conflict between reason and desire, because "customs" and "conventionalities" stand in the way of her romantic desires.&lt;ref&gt;''Desire, Class Position, and Gender in Jane Eyre and Pickwick Papers'' Benjamin Graves '97 (English 73 Brown University, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; [[E.M. Forster]]'s novels use homoerotic codes to describe same-sex desire and longing. Close male friendships with subtle homoerotic undercurrents occur in every novel, which subverts the conventional, heterosexual plot of the novels.&lt;ref&gt;Distant Desire: Homoerotic Codes and the Subversion of the English Novel in E.M. Forster's Fiction (Sexuality and Literature) by Parminder Kaur Bakshi&lt;/ref&gt; In  the Gothic-themed ''[[Dracula]]'', Stoker depicts the theme of desire which is coupled with fear. When the Lucy character is seduced by Dracula, she describes her sensations in the graveyard as a mixture of fear and blissful emotion.

Poet [[W.B. Yeats]] depicts the positive and negative aspects of desire in his poems such as "The Rose for the World", "Adam's Curse", "No Second Troy", "All Things can Tempt me", and "Meditations in Time of Civil War". Some poems depict desire as a poison for the soul; Yeats worked through his desire for his beloved, Maud Gonne, and realized that "Our longing, our craving, our thirsting for something other than Reality is what dissatisfies us". In "The Rose for the World", he admires her beauty, but feels pain because he cannot be with her. In the poem "No Second Troy", Yeats overflows with anger and bitterness because of their unrequited love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writing.colostate.edu/gallery/phantasmagoria/sepulveda.htm|title=Sepulveda - Desire: Can’t Live With It, Can’t Live Without It|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poet [[T. S. Eliot]] dealt with the themes of desire and homoeroticism in his poetry, prose and drama.&lt;ref&gt;Gender, Desire, and Sexuality in T. S. Eliot. Edited by Cassandra Laity. Drew University, New Jersey. Nancy K. Gish. University of Southern Maine ({{ISBN|978-0-521-80688-6}} | {{ISBN|0-521-80688-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; Other poems on the theme of desire include [[John Donne]]'s poem "To His Mistress Going to Bed", [[Carol Ann Duffy]]'s longings in "Warming Her Pearls"; [[Ted Hughes]]' "Lovesong" about the savage intensity of desire; and [[Wendy Cope]]'s humorous poem "Song".

Philippe Borgeaud's novels analyse how emotions such as erotic desire and seduction are connected to fear and wrath by examining cases where people are worried about issues of impurity, sin, and shame.

===Film===
Just as desire is central to the written fiction genre of romance, it is the central theme of [[melodrama]] films, which are a subgenre of the [[drama film]]. Like drama, a melodrama depends mostly on in-depth character development, interaction, and highly emotional themes. Melodramatic films tend to use plots that appeal to the heightened emotions of the audience. Melodramatic plots often deal with "crises of human emotion, failed romance or friendship, strained familial situations, tragedy, illness, neuroses, or emotional and physical hardship." Film critics sometimes use the term "pejoratively to connote an unrealistic, bathos-filled, campy tale of romance or domestic situations with stereotypical characters (often including a central female character) that would directly appeal to feminine audiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/melodramafilms.html|title=Melodramas Films|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also called "women's movies", "weepies", tearjerkers, or "chick flicks".

"Melodrama… is Hollywood's fairly consistent way of treating desire and subject identity", as can be seen in well-known films such as ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', in which "desire is the driving force for both Scarlett and the hero, Rhett". Scarlett desires love, money, the attention of men, and the vision of being a virtuous "true lady". Rhett Butler desires to be with Scarlett, which builds to a burning longing that is ultimately his undoing, because Scarlett keeps refuses his advances; when she finally confesses her secret desire, Rhett is worn out and his longing is spent.

In Cathy Cupitt's article on "Desire and Vision in Blade Runner", she argues that film, as a "visual narrative form, plays with the voyeuristic desires of its audience". Focusing on the dystopian 1980s science fiction film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', she calls the film an "Object of Visual Desire", in which it plays to an "expectation of an audience's delight in visual texture, with the 'retro-fitted' spectacle of the post-modern city to ogle" and with the use of the "motif of the 'eye'". In the film, "desire is a key motivating influence on the narrative of the film, both in the 'real world', and within the text."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/area51/hollow/2405/blade.html |title=Cathy Cupitt, ''Eyeballing the Simulacra Desire and Vision in Blade Runner'' |accessdate=2017-03-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991022015016/http://www.geocities.com/area51/hollow/2405/blade.html |archivedate=October 22, 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary spiritual perspective==
{{Importance section|date=May 2014}}
[[Barry Long]] defined desire as stress or strain. It is a tension between an individual and the thing or state that that individual desires. As the thing does not feel this stress, the desiring is a one-way tension within the individual, an apparent reaching out towards the desired object or person.

When the person responds in the way desired, or the object is attained, the desire settles down into a relationship. A relationship is identifiable by the presence of an attitude in yourself which reacts in terms of "mine".

When a desire has been reduced to the level of a habit or idea it can be dealt with and eliminated fairly quickly by observation - seeing it for what it is. In that moment you suddenly realise you are free of the relationship as a need or dependence "of mine".&lt;ref&gt;Barry Long, ''Knowing Yourself'' (pp 102 - 103)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI)''' also called Decentralized Artificial Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Demazeau, Yves, and J-P. Müller, eds. Decentralized Ai. Vol. 2. Elsevier, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; is a subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] research dedicated to the development of distributed solutions for problems. DAI is closely related to and a predecessor of the field of [[Multi-agent system|Multi-Agent Systems]].

==Definition==
Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is an approach to solving complex learning, [[automated planning|planning]], and decision making problems. It is [[embarrassingly parallel]], thus able to exploit large scale computation and spatial distribution of computing resources. These properties allow it to solve problems that require the processing of very large data sets. DAI systems consist of autonomous learning processing nodes ([[Intelligent agent|agents]]), that are distributed, often at a very large scale. DAI nodes can act independently and partial solutions are integrated by communication between nodes, often asynchronously. By virtue of their scale, DAI systems are robust and elastic, and by necessity, loosely coupled. Furthermore, DAI systems are built to be adaptive to changes in the problem definition or underlying data sets due to the scale and difficulty in redeployment.

DAI systems do not require all the relevant data to be aggregated in a single location, in contrast to monolithic or centralized Artificial Intelligence systems which have tightly coupled and geographically close processing nodes. Therefore, DAI systems often operate on sub-samples or hashed impressions of very large datasets. In addition, the source dataset may change or be updated during the course of the execution of a DAI system.

==Goals==
The objectives of Distributed Artificial Intelligence are to solve the [[automated reasoning|reasoning]], planning, learning and perception problems of [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]], especially if they require large data, by distributing the problem to autonomous processing nodes (agents). To reach the objective, DAI requires:
* A [[Distributed computing|distributed system]] with robust and elastic computation on unreliable and failing resources that are loosely coupled
* Coordination of the actions and communication of the nodes
* Subsamples of large data sets and [[online machine learning]]

There are many reasons for wanting to distribute intelligence or cope with multi-agent systems. Mainstream problems in DAI research include the following:
* Parallel problem solving: mainly deals with how classic artificial intelligence concepts can be modified, so that [[multiprocessor]] systems and clusters of computers can be used to speed up calculation.
* Distributed problem solving (DPS): the concept of [[Intelligent agent|agent]], autonomous entities that can communicate with each other, was developed to serve as an [[abstraction]] for developing DPS systems. See below for further details.
* Multi-Agent Based Simulation (MABS): a branch of DAI that builds the foundation for simulations that need to analyze not only phenomena at [[macroscopic|macro]] level but also at [[microscopic scale|micro]] level, as it is in many [[social simulation]] scenarios.

==History==
In the 1975 distributed artificial intelligence emerged as a subfield of artificial intelligence that dealt with interaction of intelligent agents[2]. Distributed artificial intelligence systems were conceived as a group of intelligent entities, called agents, that interacted by cooperation, by coexistence or by competition. DAI is categorized into Multi-agent systems and distributed problem solving [1]. In [[Multi-agent system]]s the main focus is how agents coordinate their knowledge and activities. For distributed problem solving the major focus is how the problem is decomposed and the solutions are synthesized.

==Examples==
Multi-agent systems and distributed problem solving are the two main DAI approaches. There are numerous applications and tools.

==Approaches==
Two types of DAI has emerged: 
* In [[Multi-agent system]]s agents coordinate their knowledge and activities and reason about the processes of coordination. Agents are physical or virtual entities that can act, perceive its environment and communicate with other agents. The agent is autonomous and has skills to achieve goals. The agents change the state of their environment by their actions. There are a number of different coordination techniques[3].
* In distributed problem solving the work is divided among nodes and the knowledge is shared. The main concerns are task decomposition and synthesis of the knowledge and solutions.

DAI can apply a bottom-up approach to AI, similar to the [[subsumption architecture]] as well as the traditional top-down
approach of AI. In addition, DAI can also be a vehicle for [[emergence]].

==Applications==
Areas where DAI have been applied are:
* Electronic commerce, e.g. for [[Trading strategy|trading strategies]] the DAI system learns financial trading rules from subsamples of very large samples of financial data
* Networks, e.g. in [[telecommunication]]s the DAI system controls the cooperative resources in a WLAN network http://dair.uncc.edu/projects/past-projects/wlan-resource
* [[Scheduling (production processes)|Routing]], e.g. model vehicle flow in transport networks
* [[Scheduling (production processes)|Scheduling]], e.g. [[flow shop scheduling]] where the resource management entity ensures local optimization and cooperation for global and local consistency
* Multi-Agent systems, e.g. [[Artificial life|Artificial Life]], the study of simulated life 
* Electric power systems, e.g. COndition Monitoring Multi-Agent System (COMMAS) applied to transformer condition monitoring, and IntelliTEAM II Automatic Restoration System &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catterson|first=Victoria M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Euan M.|last3=McArthur|first3=Stephen D. J.|date=2012-03-01|title=Practical applications of multi-agent systems in electric power systems|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/etep.619/abstract|journal=European Transactions on Electrical Power|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=235–252|doi=10.1002/etep.619|issn=1546-3109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
* [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/EVO-DesignOpt/groupWebSite/index.php?n=Site.BP#ECStar-fig ECStar], a distributed rule-based learning system

==Agents and Multi-agent systems==
Notion of Agents: Agents can be described as distinct entities with standard boundaries and interfaces designed for problem solving.

Notion of Multi-Agents:Multi-Agent system is defined as a network of agents which are loosely coupled working as a single entity like society for problem solving that an individual agent cannot solve.

==Software agents==
The key concept used in DPS and MABS is the abstraction called [[software agent]]s. An agent is a virtual (or physical) [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] entity that has an understanding of its environment and acts upon it. An agent is usually able to communicate with other agents in the same system to achieve a common goal, that one agent alone could not achieve. This communication system uses an [[agent communication language]].

A first classification that is useful is to divide agents into:
* reactive agent – A reactive agent is not much more than an automaton that receives input, processes it and produces an output.
* deliberative agent – A [[deliberative agent]] in contrast should have an internal view of its environment and is able to follow its own plans.
* hybrid agent – A hybrid agent is a mixture of reactive and deliberative, that follows its own plans, but also sometimes directly reacts to external events without deliberation.

Well-recognized agent architectures that describe how an agent is internally structured are:
* [[ASMO (cognitive architecture)|ASMO]] (emergence of distributed modules)
* [[BDI software agent|BDI]] (Believe Desire Intention, a general architecture that describes how plans are made)
* [[InterRAP]] (A three-layer architecture, with a reactive, a deliberative and a social layer)
* PECS (Physics, Emotion, Cognition, Social, describes how those four parts influences the agents behavior).
* [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] (a rule-based approach)

== Challenges==
The challenges in Distributed AI are:

1.How to carry out communication and interaction of agents and which communication language or protocols should be used.

2.How to ensure the coherency of agents.

3.How to synthesise the results among 'intelligent agents' group by formulation, description, decomposition and allocation.

'''Felix Grundy Mcconnell''' (April 1, 1809 &amp;ndash; September 10, 1846) was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Alabama]].

Born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Mcconnell moved with his parents to [[Fayetteville, Tennessee]], in 1811.
He received a limited education and became a saddler.
He moved to [[Talladega, Alabama]], in 1834.
He studied law.
He was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in 1836 and commenced practice in [[Talladega, Alabama]].
He served as member of the State house of representatives in 1838.
He served in the State senate 1839-1843.

Mcconnell was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[28th United States Congress|Twenty-eighth]] and [[29th United States Congress|Twenty-ninth]] Congresses and served from March 4, 1843, until his death. During his tenure in Congress, he introduced a resolution proposing the United States annex [[Ireland]]. McConnell gained a reputation for his rambunctious behavior and heavy drinking. He was involved in a number of public incidents both at home and in Washington, including interrupting a performance by violinist [[Ole Bull]] and having to have several policemen remove him from the concert hall. On September 10, 1846, in Washington, D.C., McConnell took his own life, stabbing himself in the throat and on his body, believed to have been committed in a state of mental hallucination due to [[delirium tremens]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2sNp1l1pNroC&amp;pg=PT79 Long, Kim.

'''Foss''' (c. 1873 – November 1887), formally named '''Aderphos''', was the pet cat of [[Edward Lear]], the 19th-century author, illustrator, and poet. A stumpy-tailed, portly, and unattractive [[tabby cat]], he was a favourite of Lear's and played an important role as a companion in the poet's lonely later years.  Foss is mentioned frequently in Lear's correspondence and makes an appearance in his illustrations and at least one poem.  Foss is said to have been the inspiration for the pussycat in Lear's illustrations for his poem "[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]". The funeral that Lear provided for Foss, which included an epigraphed headstone, is said to have been more elaborate than Lear's own.

== Description==
[[File:Letter from Lear to Archdeacon Bevan.jpg|thumb|Foss and Lear depicted in an 1879 letter to [[William Bevan (priest)|Archdeacon William Bevan]]]]
Foss is said to have been adopted by Edward Lear whilst a kitten in 1873, though he was later claimed by Lear to be older.&lt;ref name=stein&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stein|first1=Sadie|title=Edward Lear's Cat|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2012/10/29/edward-lear%E2%80%99s-cat/|accessdate=14 May 2018|work=The Paris Review|date=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His full name was the Greek Aderphos, but he was generally known by the shortened form of "Foss" or, particularly by Lear, "Old Foss".&lt;ref name=lear/&gt;&lt;ref name=levi&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levi|first1=Peter|title=Edward Lear: A Life|date=2013|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|isbn=9781780765693|page=263|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EeL4AAAAQBAJ|accessdate=17 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foss was a tabby cat described as unattractive.&lt;ref name=stein/&gt;&lt;ref name=bell&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Bethan|title=Whiskers in the workplace: More cats with careers|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42737193|accessdate=14 May 2018|work=BBC News|date=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tail was cut short by Lear's servants in an attempt to prevent him from wandering.&lt;ref name=bell/&gt;  No photographs survive of the cat, as he jumped out of Lear's arms on the only occasion when one was to be taken.&lt;ref name=levi/&gt;

Lear grew fond of Foss and he was said to be his favourite animal.&lt;ref name=lear&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lear|first1=Edward|title=Edward Lear|date=2001|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=9780806930770|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OOWdcHG1oXwC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=14 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foss was mentioned often in Lear's correspondence, to the extent that he was said to have been almost as famous as Lear at the time.&lt;ref name=lear/&gt;&lt;ref name=lear2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lear|first1=Edward|title=The Complete Nonsense of Edward Lear|date=2012|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486119465|page=282|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwzFZBarUkQC&amp;pg=PA282|accessdate=14 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to roll on Lear's manuscripts to help dry the ink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Mara|first1=Lesley|title=Cats' Miscellany|date=2011|publisher=Michael O'Mara Books|isbn=9781843177593|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyndAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=14 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many accounts say that when Lear was planning his relocation to [[Sanremo]], he had his architect design his new villa on the same floorplan as his previous home to avoid confusing Foss.&lt;ref name=bell/&gt;&lt;ref name=kalda/&gt;  Despite this on his first day in the villa Foss climbed into one of its chimneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levi|first1=Peter|title=Edward Lear: A Life|date=2013|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|isbn=9781780765693|page=314|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EeL4AAAAQBAJ|accessdate=17 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic influence==
[[File:Owlpussycat.jpg|thumb|Lear's pussycat]]
Foss is said to have been the model for the pussycat in Lear's "[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]" illustrations, though he chose to depict a full-length tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Choron|first1=Sandra|last2=Choron|first2=Harry|last3=Moore|first3=Arden|title=Planet Cat: A Cat-Alog|date=2007|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0618812598|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=shAHJQwXslYC|accessdate=14 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hampshire&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hampshire|first1=Kristen|last2=Bass|first2=Iris|last3=Paximadis|first3=Lori|title=Cat Lover's Daily Companion: 365 Days of Insight and Guidance for Living a Joyful Life with Your Cat|date=2011|publisher=Quarry Books|isbn=9781592537495|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MIAc2FQ0CscC|accessdate=14 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foss is also mentioned in Lear's poem "How Pleasant to Know Mr Lear":&lt;ref name=bell/&gt;

There are also many drawings by Lear of Foss including the two together and a series depicting Foss in supposed [[Attitude (heraldry)|heraldic poses]] – these include [[Attitude (heraldry)#Couchant|couchant]], [[Attitude (heraldry)#Passant|passant]], [[Attitude (heraldry)#Rampant|rampant]], [[Attitude (heraldry)#Positions indicating direction|regardant]], and the more fanciful "dansant" (dancing) and "a untin" (hunting).&lt;ref name=stein/&gt;  The ''New York Times'' stated that Lear's illustrations of Foss were his best caricatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=Peter|title=A Life of Nonsense|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/21/books/a-life-of-nonsense.html|accessdate=15 May 2018|work=The New York Times|date=21 May 1995|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gul Rahman''' ({{lang-ps|ګل رحمان}}; died 20 November 2002) was an Afghan man, suspected by the United States of being a militant, who was a victim of [[torture]]. He died in a secret [[CIA]] prison, or [[black site]], located in northern [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] and known as the [[Salt Pit]].&lt;ref name=NationalJournal2014-12-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yahoo-2010-04-06&gt;

His name was kept secret by the United States for more than seven years although his death was announced. In 2010 the [[Associated Press]] reported that before his death he was left half-stripped and chained against a concrete wall on a night when the temperature was close to freezing.&lt;ref name=NewYorker/&gt; The United States government did not notify his family (wife and four daughters) of his death, according to the report.&lt;ref name=NewYorker/&gt;

==Capture and death==
Gul Rahman was captured and arrested on 29 October 2002 during a joint operation by U.S. agents and Pakistani security forces against [[Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin]].&lt;ref name=MSNBC&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goldman |first1= Adam|author-link1=Adam Goldman|last2=Gannon|first2=Kathy |author-link2=Kathy Gannon|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36071994/ns/us_news-security/t/death-shed-light-cia-salt-pit-near-kabul/#.T4u6jatDySo |publisher=[[Associated Press]]|via=[[MSNBC]]|date=28 March 2010|accessdate=15 April 2012|title=Death shed light on CIA ‘Salt Pit’ near Kabul: Handling of terror suspect led to inquiry by agency's inspector general}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reportedly arrested with the [[physician]] [[Ghairat Baheer]], the [[son-in-law]] of the [[warlord]] [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], who leads the insurgent faction [[Hezb-e-Islami]].&lt;ref name=MSNBC/&gt; Rahman had traveled from [[Peshawar]] to [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]] for a medical checkup when he was arrested at the home of Ghairat Baheer, and subsequently flown by the CIA to Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=MSNBC/&gt;

U.S. officials claim Rahman was "violently uncooperative" while in custody at the [[Salt Pit]], the CIA code name for an abandoned brick factory that had been turned into a CIA [[black site]] or covert interrogation center,&lt;ref name=MSNBC/&gt; including threatening to kill his guards – who responded by beating him.&lt;ref name=MSNBC/&gt; Rahman was also subjected to "48 hours of sleep deprivation, auditory overload, total darkness, isolation, a cold shower and rough treatment". Gul Rahman reportedly died on 20 November 2002 after being stripped naked from the waist down and shackled to a cold cement wall in the Salt Pit, where temperatures were approximately {{convert|36|F|C}}.&lt;ref name=CbsNews-2010-04-06&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/06/world/main6368610.shtml|title=Did CIA Torture Victim Once Rescue Hamid Karzai?|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=6 April 2010|accessdate=20 April 2010|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fstories%2F2010%2F04%2F06%2Fworld%2Fmain6368610.shtml&amp;date=2010-04-20|archivedate=20 April 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This technique of shackling is known as "short-chaining." The detainee is  shackled "in a short chain position, which prevents prisoners from standing upright." A CIA pathologist reported that  Rahman "likely" froze to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leopold |first=Jason|author-link=Jason Leopold|url=https://news.vice.com/article/gul-rahman-death-at-cia-black-site-prison-cobalt|title=After a Detainee Died at a Black Site, the CIA Blamed Training From the Federal Bureau of Prisons|publisher=[[Vice News]]|date=3 June 2016|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His death prompted an internal CIA review and the development of improved guidance.&lt;ref name=MSNBC/&gt; No one was ever charged in his death.

==Rescue of Hamid Karzai==
According to Gul's brother, Habib Rahman, Gul Rahman was involved in a 1994 rescue of [[Hamid Karzai]], the president of Afghanistan since 2004. Karzai had been imprisoned by the government forces, and Rahman was working for Hekmatyar, whose forces fired rockets at the building while Rahman entered and freed Karzai. Rahman took him to a safe house in [[Kabul]].&lt;ref name=Yahoo-2010-04-06/&gt;

==Senate Intelligence Committee's report of CIA torture==
[[File:Gul Rahman CIA death investigation.pdf|thumb|left|CIA report on the death of Gul Rahman, redacted before release to the public in June 2016.]]
On December 9, 2014 the [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture|Senate Intelligence Committee's report on CIA torture]] was published.&lt;ref name=NationalJournal2014-12-10/&gt;
According to that report he had been subjected to total darkness, [[sensory overload]], [[sleep deprivation]], cold shower, "rough treatment", [[short shackling]] and finally froze to death.  The report said he was the only captive known to have died in CIA custody.

[[Steven W. Hawkins]], the executive director of [[Amnesty International USA]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', reported that he found that the CIA official responsible for Rahman's death, Jose Rodriguez was not only not punished, or sanctioned, rather, he received a cash bonus for his ''"consistently superior work"''.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2014-12-09/&gt;

On October 13, 2015 the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] filed a lawsuit &lt;ref&gt;Salim v. Mitchell - Complaint https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/salim-v-mitchell-complaint&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of Rahman's estate and two other former detainees against two psychologists, [[James Elmer Mitchell|James Mitchell]] and [[Bruce Jessen|John Jessen]], who they maintain were responsible for designing the protocols that resulted in Rahman's death and the torture of the other two plaintifs. The ACLU case is the first lawsuit brought against significant individuals identified in the Senate report since it was published.&lt;ref&gt;Jenna LcLaughlin, "Former U.S. Detainees Sue Psychologists Responsible For CIA Torture Program" https://theintercept.com/2015/10/13/former-u-s-detainees-sue-psychologists-responsible-for-cia-torture-program/&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 28, 2017, U.S. District Judge [[Justin Lowe Quackenbush]] denied both parties motions for [[summary judgment]], noted that the defendants are [[indemnity|indemnified]] by the United States government, and encouraged the attorneys to reach a [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]] before trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fink|first1=Sheri|title=2 Psychologists in C.I.A.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Howard Storm was born in [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Storm|first=Howard|year=2000|title=My Descent Into Death: And the Message of Love Which Brought Me Back|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kd4gxtQAeq8C&amp;pg=PR1 |publisher=Clairview|isbn=978 1 905570 17 1|accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[University of California Berkeley]] with a master's degree, and he later became an art professor at [[Northern Kentucky University]], a position he held for 20 years. During an interview with ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' in 1997, he reported of his life prior to his near-death experience that he was an atheist and an aggressive person, feared by his wife and children.

===Near-death experience===
In June 1985, Storm took a group of his students on a field trip to Europe. After returning to his Paris hotel room with his wife around 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. from a morning excursion, he had a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. He was evaluated at a Paris hospital and diagnosed with a [[Gastrointestinal perforation|duodenal perforation]], which required surgery. The soonest a surgeon could perform this procedure was around 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. that day. As he lay waiting for surgery, he truly believed that he was going to die due to the severity of his pain and so mentally prepared himself for death. After saying goodbye to his wife, he eventually passed out.

Storm reports the following subconscious experience: He opened his eyes and found himself standing outside of his body, looking down at the hospital bed with his wife crying beside him. He was without pain and hypersensitive. His wife could not see or hear him. He was then drawn by voices calling his name outside the hospital room, and he followed them, believing they were taking him to a doctor. He describes pale humanoid creatures that urged him down the hallway, saying that they had been waiting for him. The creatures became increasingly hostile, and upon refusing to continue following, they began to attack him. He then heard a voice saying, "pray to God," and so he recited fragment Bible verses and the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]. With mention of the word "God," the creatures would retract, and eventually he was alone again. After a period of time, he called out for [[Jesus]] to save him, and suddenly was rescued by "spiritual beings of light."

Thereafter, he had a recollection of his entire life, a [[life review]], which highlighted some negative aspects of his life, before the "beings of light" answered his questions. They told him that the United States was a "blessed nation" but one which required a change lest lose its prosperity. He describes visions of a future plagued by war, natural disasters and despair, but which could be avoided should there be a major spiritual "shift" in the consciousness of the world. These beings told him that the "correct religion" is that religion which "brings you closest to God."

When he awoke, he was being prepped for surgery, which repaired the duodenal perforation. In the following days, he reports that he was visited by a doctor upon whose arrival the room lightened, and upon his exit, it darkened again. The nurse (who's desk was just outside Storm's room) had seen nothing. Storm also recounts "a Voice" that told him to ignore the advice of doctors and buy return tickets to the U.S. a week after his procedure, which he did.  Upon his arrival in Cincinnati, he was admitted in the hospital in critical condition with double pneumonia, collapsed lung, extreme peritonitis, and non-A non-B hepatitis. His recovery took five weeks, and he reported a period of 7 months of extreme weakness before he was able to return to work.
 
Storm concedes that there is no medical evidence to suggest that he actually died.

===Aftermath===
Storm stated that over time he "became more tempered" about his experience. He became involved with a church, entered the seminary, and was ordained. He served as pastor of Zion [[United Church of Christ]] in [[Norwood, Ohio]] from 1992 to 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zionchurchucc.org/history/ History of Zion Church]. Accessed 2015-03-22.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also a pastor of the Covington United Church of Christ in [[Covington, Ohio]].

'''Humanistic naturalism''' is the branch of [[philosophical naturalism]] wherein [[human beings]] are best able to control and understand the world through use of the [[scientific method]], combined with the social and ethical values of [[humanism]]. Concepts of spirituality, intuition, and [[metaphysics]] are considered [[subjectivity|subjectively]] valuable only, primarily because they are unfalsifiable, and therefore can never progress beyond the realm of personal opinion. A boundary is not drawn between [[nature]] and what lies "beyond" nature; everything is regarded as a result of explainable processes within nature, with nothing lying outside it.&lt;ref&gt;'' Living Issues in Philosophy'' (4th ed.; New York: American Book Co., 1963): 215-221.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The belief is that all living things are intricate extensions of nature, and therefore deserve some degree of mutual respect from human beings. Naturalists accept the need for adaptation to current change, however it may be, and also that life must feed upon life for survival. However, they also recognize the necessity for a fair exchange of resources between all species. Humanistic naturalists are generally concerned with the ethical aspects of "worldview naturalism."&lt;ref&gt;''What is Humanism'' (American Humanist Association)&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Industry and technology are sometimes regarded as enemies to naturalism, but this is not always the case. For those who do believe in such threats, the thought is that the majority of human history, societies were largely agricultural and [[hunter-gatherer]] and lived in relative harmony and balance with nature. With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, some humanistic naturalists see this balance as being increasingly threatened. This view has some similarities with [[anarcho-primitivism]] and other anti-modernist perspectives.

'''''Hun''''' ({{zh|c=魂|p=hún|w=''hun''|l=cloud-soul}}) and '''''po''''' ({{zh|c=魄|p=pò|w=''p'o''|l=white-soul}}) are types of [[souls]] in [[Chinese philosophy]] and [[Chinese folk religion|traditional religion]]. Within this ancient [[soul dualism]] tradition, every living human has both a ''hun'' spiritual, ethereal, [[Yin and yang|yang]] soul which leaves the body after death, and also a ''po'' corporeal, substantive, [[Yin and yang|yin]] soul which remains with the corpse of the deceased. Some controversy exists over the number of souls in a person; for instance, one of  the traditions within [[Daoism]] proposes a soul structure of ''sanhunqipo'' 三魂七魄; that is, "three ''hun'' and seven ''po''". The historian [[Yu Ying-shih|Yü Ying-shih]]  describes ''hun'' and ''po'' as "two pivotal concepts that have been, and remain today, the key to understanding Chinese views of the human soul and the afterlife."&lt;ref&gt;Yü, 363&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese characters]] 魂 and 魄 for ''hun'' and ''po'' typify the most common [[Chinese character classification|character classification]] of "radical-phonetic" or "phono-semantic" graphs, which combine a "[[radical (Chinese characters)|radical]]" or "signific" (recurring graphic elements that roughly provide [[semantic]] information) with a "[[phonetic]]" (suggesting ancient [[pronunciation]]). ''Hun'' [[Wikt:魂|魂]] (or 䰟) and ''po'' [[Wikt:魄|魄]]  have the "ghost radical" ''gui'' [[Wikt:鬼|鬼]] "ghost; devil" and phonetics of ''yun'' [[Wikt:云|云]] "cloud; cloudy" and ''bai'' [[Wikt:白|白]] "white; clear; pure".

Besides the common meaning of "a soul", ''po'' 魄 was a [[variant Chinese character]] for ''po'' [[Wikt:霸|霸]] "a [[lunar phase]]" and ''po'' [[Wikt:粕|粕]] "dregs". The ''[[Book of Documents]]'' used ''po'' 魄 as a graphic variant for ''po'' 霸 "dark aspect of the moon" – this character usually means ''ba'' 霸 "overlord; hegemon". For example, "On the third month, when (the growth phase, 生魄) of the moon began to wane, the duke of Chow [i.e., [[Duke of Zhou]]] commenced the foundations, and proceeded to build the new great city of Lǒ" (tr. Legge 1865:434). The ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' "[Writings of] Master Zhuang" wrote ''zaopo'' 糟粕 (lit. "rotten dregs") "worthless; unwanted; waste matter" with a ''po'' 魄 variant. A wheelwright sees [[Duke Huan of Qi]] with books by dead sages and says, "what you are reading there is nothing but the [糟魄] chaff and dregs of the men of old!" (tr. Watson 1968:152).

In the [[history of writing#Chinese writing|history of Chinese writing]], characters for ''po'' 魄/霸 "lunar brightness" appeared before those for ''hun'' 魂 "soul; spirit". The spiritual ''hun'' 魂 and ''po'' 魄 "dual souls" are first recorded in [[Warring States period]] (475–221 BCE) [[seal script]] characters. The lunar ''po'' 魄 or 霸 "moon's brightness" appears in both [[Zhou dynasty]] (1045–256 BCE) [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|Bronzeware script]] and [[oracle bone script]], but not in [[Shang dynasty]] (ca. 1600–1046 BCE) oracle inscriptions. The earliest form of this "lunar brightness" character was found on a (ca. [[11th century BCE]]) Zhou oracle bone inscription (Yü 1987:370).

==Etymologies==
The ''po'' soul's [[etymology]]  is better understood than the ''hun'' soul's. Schuessler (2007:290, 417) reconstructs ''hun'' 魂 "'spiritual soul' which makes a human personality" and ''po'' 魄 "vegetative or animal soul … which accounts for growth and physiological functions" as [[Middle Chinese]] ''γuən'' and ''pʰak'' from [[Old Chinese]] *''wûn'' and *''phrâk''.

The (ca. 80 CE) ''Baihu Tang'' 白虎堂 gave pseudo-etymologies for ''hun'' and ''po'' through Chinese character puns. It explains ''hun'' 魂 with ''zhuan'' 傳 "deliver; pass on; impart; spread" and ''yun'' 芸 "[[rue]] (used to keep insects out of books); to weed", and ''po'' 魄 with ''po'' 迫 " compel; force; coerce; urgent" and ''bai'' 白 "white; bright".

&lt;blockquote&gt;What do the words ''hun'' and [''po'']  mean? ''Hun'' expresses the idea of continuous propagation ([''zhuan''] 傳), unresting flight; it is the ''[[qi]]'' of the Lesser Yang, working in man in an external direction, and it governs the nature (or the instincts, [''xing''] 性). [''Po''] expresses the idea of a continuous pressing urge ([''po''] 迫) on man; it is the [''qi''] of the Lesser Yin, and works in him, governing the emotions ([''qing''] 情). ''Hun'' is connected with the idea of weeding ([''yun''] 芸), for with the instincts the evil weeds (in man's nature) are removed. [''Po''] is connected with the idea of brightening ([''bai''] 白), for with the emotions the interior (of the personality) is governed. (tr. Needham and Lu 1974:87) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Etymologically, Schuessler says ''pò'' 魄 "animal soul" "is the same word as" ''pò'' 霸 "a [[lunar phase]]". He cites the ''[[Zuozhuan]]'' (534 BCE, see below) using the lunar ''jishengpo'' 既生魄 to mean "With the first development of a fetus grows the vegetative soul".
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Pò'', the soul responsible for growth, is the same as ''pò'' the waxing and waning of the moon". The meaning 'soul' has probably been transferred from the moon since men must have been aware of lunar phases long before they had developed theories on the soul. This is supported by the etymology 'bright', and by the inverted word order which can only have originated with meteorological expressions … The association with the moon explains perhaps why the ''pò'' soul is classified as Yin … in spite of the etymology 'bright' (which should be Yang), hun's Yang classificiation may be due to the association with clouds and by extension sky, even though the word invokes 'dark'. 'Soul' and 'moon' are related in other cultures, by cognation or convergence, as in [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] and Proto-[[Lolo–Burmese]] *''s/ʼ-la'' "moon; soul; spirit", [[Classical Tibetan|Written Tibetan]] cognates ''bla'' "soul" and ''zla'' "moon", and Proto-[[Hmong–Mien languages|Miao–Yao]] *''bla'' "spirit; soul; moon". (2007:417) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lunar associations of ''po'' are evident in the [[Classical Chinese]] terms ''chanpo'' 蟾魄 "the moon" (with "toad; [[Lunar_pareidolia#Toad |toad in the moon]]; moon") and ''haopo'' 皓魄 "moon; moonlight" (with "white; bright; luminous").

The semantics of ''po'' 魄 "white soul" probably originated with 霸 "lunar whiteness". Zhou bronze inscriptions commonly recorded lunar phases with the terms ''jishengpo'' 既生魄 "after the brightness has grown" and  ''jisipo'' 既死魄 "after the brightness has died", which Schuessler explains as "second quarter of the lunar month" and "last quarter of the lunar month". Chinese scholars have variously interpreted these two terms as lunar quarters or fixed days, and (Shaughnessy 1992:136–145) [[Wang Guowei]]'s lunar-quarter analysis the most likely. Thus, ''jishengpo'' is from the 7th/8th to the 14th/15th days of the lunar month and ''jisipo'' is from the 23rd/24th to the end of the month. Yü (1987:370) translates them as "after the birth of the crescent" and "after the death of the crescent". Etymologically, lunar and spiritual ''po'' &lt; ''pʰak'' &lt; *''phrâk'' 魄 are cognate with ''bai'' &lt; ''bɐk'' &lt; *''brâk'' 白 "white" (Matisoff 1980, Yü 1981, Carr 1985). According to [[Hu Shih]] (1946:30), ''po'' etymologically means "white, whiteness, and bright light"; "The primitive Chinese seem to have regarded the changing phases of the moon as periodic birth and death of its [''po''], its 'white light' or soul." Yü (1981:83) says this ancient association between the ''po'' soul and the "growing light of the new moon is of tremendous importance to our understanding of certain myths related to the seventh day of the months." Two celebrated examples in [[Chinese mythology]] are [[Xi Wang Mu#Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty|Xi Wangmu and Emperor Wu]] meeting on the seventh day of the first lunar month and [[The Jade Emperor#The princess and the cowherd|The Princess and the Cowherd]] or [[Qixi Festival]] held on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month.

The etymology of ''hun'' &lt; ''γuən'' &lt; *''wûn'' 魂 is comparatively less certain. Hu (1946:31) said, "The word ''hun'' is etymologically the same as the word ''yun'', meaning "clouds." The clouds float about and seem more free and more active than the cold, white-lighted portion of the growing and waning moon." Schuessler cites two possibilities. &lt;blockquote&gt;Since ''pò'' is the 'bright' soul, ''hún'' is the 'dark' soul and therefore cognate to ''yún'' 雲 'cloud' [Carr 1985:62], perhaps in the sense of 'shadowy' because some believe that the ''hún'' soul will live after death in a world of shadows [Eberhard 1967:17]. (2007:290) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both Chinese ''hun'' and ''po'' are translatable as English "[[soul]]" or "[[spirit]]", and both are basic components in "soul" [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]]. In the following examples, all Chinese-English translation equivalents are from DeFrancis (2003).

*''hunpo'' [[Wikt:魂魄|魂魄]] "soul; psyche"
*''linghun'' 靈魂 "soul; spirit"
*''hunling'' 魂靈 "(colloquial) soul; ghost"
*''yinhun'' 陰魂 "soul; spirit; apparition"
*''sanhunqipo'' 三魂七魄 "soul; three finer spirits and several baser instincts that motivate a human being"
*''xinpo'' 心魄 "soul"

''Hunpo'' and ''linghun'' are the most frequently used among these "soul" words.

[[Joseph Needham]] and [[Lu Gwei-djen]], eminent [[History of science and technology in China|historians of science and technology in China]], (1974:88) define ''hun'' and ''po'' in modern terms. "Peering as far as one can into these ancient psycho-physiological ideas, one gains the impression that the distinction was something like that between what we would call motor and sensory activity on the one hand, and also voluntary as against vegetative processes on the other."

Farzeen Baldrian-Hussein (2008:521) cautions about ''hun'' and ''po'' translations: "Although the term "souls" is often used to refer to them, they are better seen as two types of vital entities, the source of life in every individual. The ''hun'' is Yang, luminous, and volatile, while the ''po'' is Yin, somber, and heavy."

==History==
Based on ''Zuozhuan'' usages of ''hun'' and ''po'' in four historical contexts, Yü (1987:370) extrapolates that ''po'' was the original name for a human soul, and the dualistic conception of ''hun'' and ''po'' "began to gain currency in the middle of the sixth century" BCE.

Two earlier 6th century contexts used the ''po'' soul alone. Both describe ''[[Tian]]'' 天 "heaven; god" ''duo'' 奪 "seizing; taking away" a person's ''po'', which resulted in a loss of mental faculties. In 593 BCE (Duke Xuan 15th year, tr. Legge 1872:329), after Zhao Tong 趙同 behaved inappropriately at the Zhou court, an observer predicted: "In less than ten years [Zhao Tong] will be sure to meet with great calamity. Heaven has taken his [魄] wits away from him." In 543 BCE (Duke Xiang 29th year, tr. Legge 1872:551), Boyou 伯有 from the state of [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]] acted irrationally, which an official interpreted as: "Heaven is destroying [Boyou], and has taken away his [魄] reason." Boyou's political enemies subsequently arranged to take away his hereditary position and assassinate him.

Two later sixth-century ''Zuozhuan'' contexts used ''po'' together with the ''hun'' soul. In 534 BCE, the ghost of Boyou 伯有 (above) was seeking revenge on his murderers, and terrifying the people of Zheng.&lt;ref&gt;Duke Zhao, Year &amp;, tr. Legge 1872:618&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher and statesman [[Zi Chan]], realizing that Boyou's loss of hereditary office had caused his spirit to be deprived of sacrifices, reinstated his son to the family position, and the ghost disappeared. When a friend asked Zi Chan to explain ghosts, he gave what Yu calls "the ''locus classicus'' on the subject of the human soul in the Chinese tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Yu 1972:372&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|When a man is born, (we see) in his first movements what is called the [魄] animal soul. [既生魄] After this has been produced, it is developed into what is called the [魂] spirit. By the use of things the subtle elements are multiplied, and the [魂魄] soul and spirit become strong. They go on in this way, growing in etherealness and brightness, till they become (thoroughly) spiritual and intelligent. When an ordinary man or woman dies a violent death, the [魂魄] soul and spirit are still able to keep hanging about men in the shape of an evil apparition; how much more might this be expected in the case of [Boyou]. … Belonging to a family which had held for three generations the handle of government, his use of things had been extensive, the subtle essences which he had imbibed had been many. His clan also was a great one, and his connexions [sic] were distinguished. Is it not entirely reasonable that, having died a violent death, he should be a [鬼] ghost?&lt;ref&gt;Yu 1972:372&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Compare the translation of Needham and Lu, who interpret this as an early Chinese discourse on embryology. 
{{quote|When a foetus begins to develop, it is (due to) the [''po'']. (When this soul has given it a form) then comes the Yang part, called ''hun''. The essences ([''qing''] 情) of many things (''wu'' 物) then give strength to these (two souls), and so they acquire the vitality, animation and good cheer (''shuang'' 爽) of these essences. Thus eventually there arises spirituality and intelligence (''shen ming'' 神明).&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974:86)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 516 BCE (Duke Zhao, Year 20), the Duke of [[Song (state)|Song]] and a guest named Shusun 叔孫 were both seen weeping during a supposedly joyful gathering. Yue Qi 樂祁, a Song court official, said:
{{quote|This year both our ruler and [Shusun] are likely to die. I have heard that joy in the midst of grief and grief in the midst of joy are signs of a loss of [''xin'' 心] mind. The essential vigor and brightness of the mind is what we call the [''hun''] and the [''po'']. When these leave it, how can the man continue long?&lt;ref&gt;tr. Legge 1872:708&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Hun'' and ''po'' souls, explains Yu (1987:371), "are regarded as the very essence of the mind, the source of knowledge and intelligence. Death is thought to follow inevitably when the ''hun'' and the ''p'o'' leave the body. We have reason to believe that around this time the idea of ''hun'' was still relatively new."

[[File:Mawangdui silk banner from tomb no1.jpg|thumb|Silk painting found in the tomb of [[Xin Zhui|Lady Dai]] at [[Mawangdui]] dated to 168 BCE, interpreted (Yü 1987:367) as depicting her ''hun'' soul ascending to heaven and her family performing the ''zhaohun'' "summoning the soul" ritual below.]]

Soon after death, it was believed that a person's ''hun'' and ''po'' could be temporarily reunited through a ritual called the ''fu'' 復 "recall; return", ''zhaohun'' 招魂 "summon the ''hun'' soul", or ''zhaohun fupo'' 招魂復魄 "to summon the ''hun''-soul to reunite with the ''po''-soul". The earliest known account of this ritual is found in the (3rd century BCE) ''[[Chuci]]'' poems ''[[Zhao Hun]]'' 招魂 "Summons of the Soul" and ''Dazhao'' 大招 "[[The Great Summons]]".&lt;ref&gt;Csíkszentmihályi 2006:140–141&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Wu (shaman)|''wu'']] Yang ({{zh|c=巫陽}}) summons a man's soul in the "Zhao Hun".

{{quote|O soul, come back! Why have you left your old abode and sped to the earth's far corners, deserting the place of your delight to meet all those things of evil omen?

O soul, come back! In the east you cannot abide. There are giants there a thousand fathoms tall, who seek only for souls to catch, and ten suns that come out together, melting metal, dissolving stone …

O soul, come back! In the south you cannot stay. There the people have tattooed faces and blackened teeth, they sacrifice flesh of men, and pound their bones to paste …

O soul, come back! For the west holds many perils: The Moving Sands stretch on for a hundred leagues. You will be swept into the Thunder's Chasm and dashed in pieces, unable to help yourself ...

O soul, come back! In the north you may not stay. There the layered ice rises high, and the snowflakes fly for a hundred leagues and more…

O soul, come back! Climb not to heaven above. For tigers and leopards guard the gates, with jaws ever ready to rend up mortal men …

O soul, come back! Go not down to the Land of Darkness, where the Earth God lies, nine-coiled, with dreadful horns on his forehead, and a great humped back and bloody thumbs, pursuing men, swift-footed ...&lt;ref&gt;tr. Hawkes 1985:244–5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hu (1946:31–32) proposed, "The idea of a ''hun'' may have been a contribution from the southern peoples" (who originated ''Zhao Hun'' rituals) and then spread to the north sometime during the sixth century BCE. Calling this southern hypothesis "quite possible", Yu (1987:373) cites the ''Chuci'', associated with the southern state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]], demonstrating "there can be little doubt that in the southern tradition the ''hun'' was regarded as a more active and vital soul than the ''p'o''. The ''Chuci'' uses ''hun'' 65 times and ''po'' 5 times (4 in ''hunpo'', which the ''Chuci'' uses interchangeably with ''hun'', Brashier 1996:131).

The identification of the ''yin-yang'' principle with the ''hun'' and ''po'' souls evidently occurred in the late fourth and early third centuries BCE (Yü 1987:374), and by "the second century at the latest, the Chinese dualistic conception of soul had reached its definitive formulation." The ''Liji'' (11, tr. Legge 1885:444) compounds ''hun'' and ''po'' with ''[[qi]]'' "breath; life force" and ''xing'' "form; shape; body" in ''hunqi'' 魂氣 and ''xingpo'' 形魄. "The [魂氣] intelligent spirit returns to heaven the [形魄] body and the animal soul return to the earth; and hence arose the idea of seeking (for the deceased) in sacrifice in the unseen darkness and in the bright region above." Compare this modern translation (Yü 1987:374), "The breath-soul (''hun-ch'I'' 魂氣) returns to heaven; the bodily soul (''hsing-p'o'' 形魄) returns to earth. Therefore, in sacrificial-offering one should seek the meaning in the ''yin-yang'' 陰陽 principle." Yü summarizes ''hun''/''po'' dualism.

{{quote|Ancient Chinese generally believed that the individual human life consists of a bodily part as well as a spiritual part. The physical body relies for its existence on food and drink produced by the earth. The spirit depends for its existence on the invisible life force called ''ch'i'', which comes into the body from heaven. In other words, breathing and eating are the two basic activities by which a man continually maintains his life. But the body and the spirit are each governed by a soul, namely, the ''p'o'' and the ''hun''. It is for this reason that they are referred to in the passage just quoted above as the bodily-soul (''hsing-p'o'') and the breath-soul (''hun-ch'i'') respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Yü 1987:376&lt;/ref&gt;)}}

Loewe (1979:9) explains with a candle metaphor; the physical ''xing'' is the "wick and substance of a candle", the spiritual ''po'' and ''hun'' are the "force that keeps the candle alight" and "light that emanates from the candle".

The Yin ''po'' and Yang ''hun'' were correlated with Chinese spiritual and medical beliefs. ''Hun'' 魂 is associated with ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' 神 "spirit; god" and ''po'' 魄with [[Ghosts in Chinese culture#Terminology|''gui'']] 鬼 "ghost; demon; devil" (Carr 1985:62). The (ca. 1st century BCE) ''[[Lingshu Jing]]'' medical text spiritually applies [[Wu Xing]] "Five Phase" theory to the ''[[Zang-fu]]'' "organs", associating the ''hun'' soul with [[liver (Chinese medicine)]] and blood, and the ''po'' soul with [[lung (Chinese medicine)]] and breath.

{{quote|The liver stores the blood, and the blood houses the ''hun''. When the vital energies of the liver are depleted, this results in fear; when repleted, this results in anger. … The lungs store the breath, and the breath houses the ''po''. When the vital energies of the lungs are depleted, then the nose becomes blocked and useless, and so there is diminished breath; when they are repleted, there is panting, a full chest, and one must elevate the head to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;tr. Brashier 1996:141&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[Lingshu Jing]]'' (Brashier 1996:142) also records that the ''hun'' and ''po'' souls taking flight can cause restless dreaming, and eye disorders can scatter the souls causing mental confusion. Han medical texts reveal that ''hun'' and ''po'' departing from the body does not necessarily cause death but rather distress and sickness. Brashier (1996:145–6) parallels the translation of ''hun'' and ''po'', "If one were to put an English word to them, they are our 'wits', our ability to demarcate clearly, and like the English concept of "wits," they can be scared out of us or can dissipate in old age."

[[File:CapitalMuseum14.jpg|thumb|[[Jade burial suit]]s were believed to delay the bodily ''po'' soul's decomposition.]]
During the [[Han Dynasty]], the belief in ''hun'' and ''po'' remained prominent, although there was a great diversity of different, sometimes contradictory, beliefs about the afterlife (Hansen 2000:119; Csikszentmihalyi 2006:116–117, 140–142). Han burial customs provided nourishment and comfort for the ''po'' with the placement of [[grave goods]], including food, commodities, and even [[Ancient Chinese coinage|money]] within the tomb of the deceased (Hansen 2000:119). [[Chinese jade]] was believed to delay the decomposition of a body. Pieces of jade were commonly placed in bodily orifices, or rarely crafted into [[jade burial suit]]s.

Generations of sinologists have repeatedly asserted that Han-era people commonly believed the heavenly ''hun'' and earthly ''po'' souls separated at death, but recent scholarship and archeology suggest that ''hunpo'' dualism was more an academic theory than a popular faith. [[Anna Seidel]] analyzed funerary texts discovered in Han tombs, which mention not only ''po'' souls but also ''hun'' remaining with entombed corpses, and wrote (1982:107), "Indeed, a clear separation of a ''p'o'', appeased with the wealth included in the tomb, from a ''hun'' departed to heavenly realms is not possible." Seidel later (1987:227) called for reappraising Han abstract notions of ''hun'' and ''po'', which "do not seem to have had as wide a currency as we assumed up to now." Pu Muzhou surveyed usages of the words ''hun'' and ''po'' on Han Dynasty ''bei'' 碑 "[[stele]]" erected at graves and shrines, and concluded (1993:216, tr. Brashier 1996126), "The thinking of ordinary people seems to have been quite hazy on the matter of what distinguished the ''hun'' from the ''po''." These stele texts contrasted souls between a corporeal ''hun'' or ''hunpo'' at the cemetery and a spiritual ''shen'' at the family shrine. Kenneth Brashier (1996:158) reexamined the evidence for ''hunpo'' dualism and relegated it "to the realm of scholasticism rather than general beliefs on death." Brashier (1996:136–137) cited several Han sources (grave deeds, ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'', and ''[[Jiaoshi Yilin]]'') attesting beliefs that "the ''hun'' remains in the grave instead of flying up to heaven", and suggested it "was sealed into the grave to prevent its escape." Another Han text, the ''[[Fengsu Tongyi]]'' says, "The vital energy of the ''hun'' of a dead person floats away; therefore a mask is made in order to retain it.

==Daoism==
''Hun'' 魂 and ''po'' 魄 spiritual concepts were important in several [[Daoist]] traditions. For instance  (Baldrian-Hussein 2008:522), "Since the volatile ''hun'' is fond of wandering and leaving the body during sleep, techniques were devised to restrain it, one of which entailed a method of staying constantly awake."

The ''sanhunqipo'' 三魂七魄 "three ''hun'' and seven ''po''" were anthropomorphized and visualized. [[Ge Hong]]'s (ca. 320 CE) ''[[Baopuzi]]'' frequently mentions the ''hun'' and ''po'' "ethereal and gross souls". The "Genii" Chapter argues that these dual souls cause illness and death.
&lt;blockquote&gt;All men, wise or foolish, know that their bodies contain ethereal as well as gross breaths, and that when some of them quit the body, illness ensues; when they all leave him, a man dies. In the former case, the magicians have amulets for restraining them; in the latter case, ''The Rites'' [i.e., ''[[Yili (text)|Yili]]''] provide ceremonials for summoning them back. These breaths are most intimately bound up with us, for they are born when we are, but over a whole lifetime probably nobody actually hears or sees them. Would one conclude that they do not exist because they are neither seen nor heard? (2, tr. Ware 1966:49–50)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This "magicians" translates [[fangshi]] 方士 "doctor; diviner' magician". Both ''fangshi'' and ''daoshi'' 道士 "Daoist priests" developed methods and rituals to summon ''hun'' and ''po'' back into a person's body. The "Gold and Cinnabar" chapter records a [[Chinese alchemy|Daoist alchemical]] reanimation pill that can return the ''hun'' and ''po'' souls to a recent corpse: ''Taiyi zhaohunpo dan fa'' 太乙招魂魄丹法 "The Great One's Elixir Method for Summoning Souls".

&lt;blockquote&gt;In T'ai-i's elixir for Summoning Gross and Ethereal Breaths the five minerals [i.e., [[cinnabar]], [[realgar]], [[arsenolite]], [[malachite]], and [[magnetite]]] are used and sealed with Six-One lute as in the Nine-crucible cinnabars. It is particularly effective for raising those who have died of a stroke. In cases where the corpse has been dead less than four days, force open the corpse's mouth and insert a pill of this elixir and one of sulphur, washing them down its gullet with water. The corpse will immediately come to life. In every case the resurrected remark that they have seen a messenger with a baton of authority summoning them. (4, tr. Ware 1966:87)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For visualizing the ten souls, the ''Baopuzi'' "Truth on Earth" chapter recommends taking ''dayao'' 大藥 "great medicines" and practicing a ''[[Fenshen|fenxing]]'' "divide/multiply the body" [[multilocation]] technique.

&lt;blockquote&gt;My teacher used to say that to preserve Unity was to practice jointly Bright Mirror, and that on becoming successful in the mirror procedure a man would be able to multiply his body to several dozen all with the same dress and facial expression. My teacher also used to say that you should take the great medicines diligently if you wished to enjoy Fullness of Life, and that you should use metal solutions and a multiplication of your person if you wished to communicate with the gods. By multiplying the body, the three ''Hun'' and the seven ''Po'' are automatically seen within the body, and in addition it becomes possible to meet and visit the powers of heaven and the deities of earth and to have all the gods of the mountains and rivers in one's service. (18, tr. Ware 1966:306)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Daoist [[Shangqing School]] has several meditation techniques for visualizing the ''hun'' and ''po''. In Shangqing [[Neidan]] "Internal Alchemy", Baldrian-Hussein says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;the ''po'' plays a particularly somber role as it represents the passions that dominate the ''hun''. This causes the vital force to decay, especially during sexual activity, and eventually leads to death. The inner alchemical practice seeks to concentrate the vital forces within the body by reversing the respective roles of ''hun'' and ''po'', so that the ''hun'' (Yang) controls the ''po'' (Yin). (2008:533) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Number of souls==
The number of human "souls" has been a long-standing source of controversy among Chinese religious traditions. Stevan Harrell (1979:521) concludes, "Almost every number from one to a dozen has at one time or another been proposed as the correct one." The most commonly believed numbers of "souls" in a person are one, two, three, and ten.

One "soul" or ''linghun'' 靈魂 is the simplest idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zhncku.med.ncku.edu.tw/buddhism/warehouse/C00/382458492.pdf 「一魂一魄」錯解為「三魂七魄」的觀念史源流，並論祖先牌位信仰的實況]&lt;/ref&gt; Harrell gives a fieldwork example.
&lt;blockquote&gt;When rural Taiwanese perform ancestral sacrifices at home, they naturally think of the ''ling-hun'' in the tablet; when they take offerings to the cemetery, they think of it in the grave; and when they go on shamanistic trips, they think of it in the ''yin'' world. Because the contexts are separate, there is little conflict and little need for abstract reasoning about a nonexistent problem. (1979:523) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Two "souls" is a common folk belief, and reinforced by ''yin-yang'' theory. These paired souls can be called ''hun'' and ''po'', ''hunpo'' and ''shen'', or  ''linghun'' and ''shen''.

[[Three Treasures (traditional Chinese medicine)|Three "souls"]] comes from widespread beliefs that the soul of a dead person can exist in the multiple locations. The missionary [[Justus Doolittle]] recorded that Chinese people in [[Fuzhou]] 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Believe each person has ''three distinct'' souls while living. These souls separate at the death of the adult to whom they belong. One resides in the ancestral tablet erected to his memory, if the head of a family; another lurks in the coffin or the grave, and the third departs to the infernal regions to undergo its merited punishment. (1865 II:401–2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ten "souls" of ''sanhunqipo'' 三魂七魄 "three ''hun'' and seven ''po''" is not only Daoist; "Some authorities would maintain that the three-seven "soul" is basic to all Chinese religion" (Harrell 1979:522). During the Later Han period, Daoists fixed the number of ''hun'' souls at three and the number of ''po'' souls at seven. A newly deceased person may return ([[:zh-yue:回魂|回魂]]) to his home at some nights, sometimes one week ([[:zh:頭七|頭七]]) after his death and the seven po would disappear one by one every 7 days after death. According to Needham and Lu (1974:88), "It is a little difficult to ascertain the reason for this, since fives and sixes (if they corresponded to the viscera) would have rather been expected." Three ''hun'' may stand for the ''sangang'' 三綱 "three principles of social order: relationships between ruler-subject, father-child, and husband-wife" (Needham 1974:89). Seven ''po'' may stand for the ''qiqiao'' 七竅 "seven apertures (in the head, eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth)" or the ''qiqing'' 七情 "seven emotions (joy, anger, sorrow, fear, worry, grief, fright)" in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (Baldrian-Hussein 2008:522). Sanhunqipo also stand for other names.

{{nihongo|'''''Ikejime'''''|活け締め}} or {{nihongo|'''''Ikijime'''''|活き締め}} is a method of slaughtering [[fish]] to maintain the quality of its meat.&lt;ref name="APEC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/trade/APEC_Air.pdf|page=xxiii|publisher=APEC Fisheries Working Group|title=APEC AIR SHIPMENT OF LIVE AND FRESH FISH &amp; SEAFOOD GUIDELINES|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique originated in [[Japan]], but is now in widespread use. It involves the insertion of a spike quickly and directly into the [[hindbrain]], usually located slightly behind and above the eye, thereby causing immediate [[brain death]].&lt;ref&gt;Websites such as [http://www.ikijime.com www.ikijime.com] and phone apps such as ''Ikijime Tool'' show the brain location of many fish species.&lt;/ref&gt;  When spiked correctly, the fish fins flare and the fish relaxes, immediately ceasing all motion. Destroying the brain and the spinal cord of the fish will prevent reflex action from happening; such muscle movements would otherwise consume [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) in the muscle, and as a result produce [[lactic acid]], making the fish sour. Furthermore, the blood contained in the fish flesh retracts to the gut cavity, which produces a better coloured and flavoured fillet. This method is considered to be the fastest and most humane method of killing fish.&lt;ref name="Poli-BM-2005"&gt;Poli BM, Parisi G, Scappini F, Zampacavallo G (2005). Fish welfare and quality as affected by pre-slaughter and slaughter management. Aquaculture International 13: 29-49&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very similar to the technique used on [[frog]]s in [[animal testing|laboratories]] called spiking or [[pithing]].

Another technique in APEC Air shipment of live and fresh fish and seafood guidelines is described as follows: "A cut is made toward the front of the flatfish severing the major artery and the spinal cord. Placement of the cut is made to preserve the greatest amount of flatfish flesh. This paralyzes the flatfish. A second cut is made in the tail to hasten the removal of blood. Flatfish are then chilled slowly to maintain circulation and facilitate the bleeding process. After the flatfish have been bled, they are transferred to a salt/ice water slurry and chilled to 12°C."&lt;ref name="APEC-other-technique"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/trade/APEC_Air.pdf|page=29|publisher=APEC Fisheries Working Group|title=APEC AIR SHIPMENT OF LIVE AND FRESH FISH &amp; SEAFOOD GUIDELINES|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ikejime'' has been successfully used manually in the tuna and yellowtail industries, along with limited use in sport and game fishing, as it provides a rapid slaughter technique. An alternative to cutting their throats and leaving the fish to die by bleeding, ''ikejime'' is used and the fish put straight into ice.&lt;ref name="Poli-BM-2005" /&gt;

'''Infectious tolerance''' is a term referring to a phenomenon where a tolerance-inducing state is transferred from one cell population to another. It can be induced in many ways; although it is often artificially induced, it is a natural ''in vivo'' process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobbold|first=S.|last2=Waldmann|first2=H.|date=October 1998|title=Infectious tolerance|journal=Current Opinion in Immunology|volume=10|issue=5|pages=518–524|issn=0952-7915|pmid=9794831}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of research deal with the development of a strategy utilizing this phenomenon in transplantation immunology. The goal is to achieve long-term tolerance of the [[Transplant rejection|transplant]] through short-term therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kendal|first=Adrian R.|last2=Waldmann|first2=Herman|date=October 2010|title=Infectious tolerance: therapeutic potential|journal=Current Opinion in Immunology|volume=22|issue=5|pages=560–565|doi=10.1016/j.coi.2010.08.002|issn=1879-0372|pmid=20829013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term "infectious tolerance" was originally used by Gershon and Kondo in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gershon|first=R. K.|last2=Kondo|first2=K.|date=December 1971|title=Infectious immunological tolerance|journal=Immunology|volume=21|issue=6|pages=903–914|issn=0019-2805|pmc=1408252|pmid=4943147}}&lt;/ref&gt; for suppression of naive lymphocyte populations by cells with regulatory function and for the ability to transfer a state of unresponsiveness from one animal to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gershon|first=R. K.|date=1975|title=A disquisition on suppressor T cells|journal=Transplantation Reviews|volume=26|pages=170–185|issn=0082-5948|pmid=1101469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gershon and Kondo discovered that T cells can not only amplify but also diminish immune responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gershon|first=R. K.|last2=Kondo|first2=K.|date=May 1970|title=Cell interactions in the induction of tolerance: the role of thymic lymphocytes|journal=Immunology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=723–737|issn=0019-2805|pmc=1455602|pmid=4911896}}&lt;/ref&gt; The T cell population causing this down-regulation was called suppressor T cells and was intensively studied for the following years (nowadays they are called [[regulatory T cell]]s and are again a very attractive for research).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sakaguchi|first=Shimon|last2=Wing|first2=Kajsa|last3=Miyara|first3=Makoto|date=November 2007|title=Regulatory T cells - a brief history and perspective|journal=European Journal of Immunology|volume=37 Suppl 1|pages=S116–123|doi=10.1002/eji.200737593|issn=0014-2980|pmid=17972355}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other research in the 1970s showed greater complexity of immune regulation, unfortunately these experiments were largely disregarded, as methodological difficulties prevented clear evidence. Later developed new tolerogenic strategies have provided strong evidence to re-evaluate the phenomenon of T cell mediated suppression, in particular the use of non-depleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating that neither [[thymus]] nor [[clonal deletion]] is necessary to induce tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qin|first=S. X.|last2=Wise|first2=M.|last3=Cobbold|first3=S. P.|last4=Leong|first4=L.|last5=Kong|first5=Y. C.|last6=Parnes|first6=J.

X.|last2=Cobbold|first2=S.|last3=Benjamin|first3=R.|last4=Waldmann|first4=H.|date=1989-03-01|title=Induction of classical transplantation tolerance in the adult|journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine|volume=169|issue=3|pages=779–794|issn=0022-1007|pmc=2189271|pmid=2647894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later was shown that the effect of monoclonal antibodies is formation of regulatory T lymphocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tilney|first=N. L.|last2=Guttmann|first2=R.

D.|date=December 1993|title=Toward a rational design of clinical trials of immunosuppressive agents in transplantation|journal=Immunological Reviews|volume=136|pages=29–49|issn=0105-2896|pmid=8132202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because second-generation tolerance arises in the absence of any monoclonal antibodies to CD4 or CD8, it probably represents a natural response of the immune system, which, once initiated, becomes self-sustaining. This ensures the long duration of once induced tolerance, for as long as the donor antigens are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qin|first=S.|last2=Cobbold|first2=S.

== Mechanisms ==
[[File:Immunoregulation by regulatory T cells (Treg)..jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Treg migrate to the grafted tissue. Activated Treg convert ATP released by inflamed tissues to adenosine via the ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73. Local adenosine could contribute to the initial “privileged” microenvironment. Treg also secrete TGF-β and IL-10 which inhibit the maturation and migration of dendritic cells (DC). These “decommissioned” DC can secrete catabolic enzymes for depletion of essential amino acids (EAA) and, therefore, induce apoptosis of effector T cells. Moreover, the “privileged” tissues could release pro-apoptotic galectin-9 which binds to TIM-3 expressed by effector T cells such as Th1 and Th17. This further amplifies the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Each of these components within the graft can further reinforce the local anti-inflammatory state such that any naive T cell, migrating into this area, will be converted to induced Treg (iTreg) through infectious tolerance.

During a tolerant state potential effector cells remain but are tightly regulated by induced antigen-specific CD4+ [[regulatory T cell]]s (iTregs). Many subsets of iTregs play a part in this proces, but CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD25&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;FoxP3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Tregs play a key role, because they have the ability to convert conventional T cells into iTregs directly by secretion of the suppressive cytokines [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-β]], [[IL-10 family|IL-10]] or [[Interleukin 35|IL-35]], or indirectly via [[Dendritic cell|dendritic cells (DCs)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gravano|first=David M.|last2=Vignali|first2=Dario A.A.|date=June 2012|title=The Battle Against Immunopathology: Infectious Tolerance Mediated by Regulatory T Cells|journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|volume=69|issue=12|pages=1997–2008|doi=10.1007/s00018-011-0907-z|issn=1420-682X|pmc=3353028|pmid=22205213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of IL-10 induces the formation of another population of regulatory T cells called Tr1.

'''Jack Kevorkian''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ᵻ|ˈ|v|ɔːr|k|i|ə|n}};&lt;!--Birth date given in various sources vary from May 20 to 29, 1928--&gt; May 26, 1928&amp;nbsp;– June 3, 2011) was an American [[pathologist]] and [[euthanasia]] proponent. He is best known for publicly championing a terminal patient's [[right to die]] via [[assisted suicide|physician-assisted suicide]]; he claimed to have assisted at least 130 patients to that end. He was often portrayed in the media with the name of "Dr. Death". There was support for his cause,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestir.cafemom.com/politics_views/121243/jack_kevorkian_was_a_hero Jack Kevorkian Was a Hero Not a Monster] The Stir&lt;/ref&gt; and he helped set the platform for reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2351178 | pmid=8664610 | volume=312 | title=Jack Kevorkian: a medical hero | author=Roberts J, Kjellstrand C | journal=BMJ | page=1434 | doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7044.1434}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "Dying is not a crime".&lt;ref name="wells"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Introducing Christian Ethics| first1=Samuel| last1=Wells| first2=Ben| last2=Quash| page=329| publisher=John Wiley and Sons| year=2010|isbn=978-1-4051-5276-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Kevorkian was arrested and tried for his direct role in a case of [[voluntary euthanasia]]. He was convicted of [[First degree murder in the United States|second-degree murder]] and served eight years of a 10-to-25-year prison sentence. He was released on parole on June 1, 2007, on condition he would not offer advice nor participate nor be present in the act of any type of suicide involving euthanasia to any other person; as well as neither promote nor talk about the procedure of assisted suicide.&lt;ref name="davey"&gt;Monica Davey.

==Early life and education==
Kevorkian was born in [[Pontiac, Michigan]], on May 26, 1928,&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;{{cite news| last=Schneider| first=Keith| title=Dr. Jack Kevorkian Dies at 83; A Doctor Who Helped End Lives| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/04/us/04kevorkian.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalnewstoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/227470.php|title=Jacob 'Jack' Kevorkian Dies; Death With Dignity Proponent Remembered|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Armenian American|Armenian]] immigrants. His father, Levon, was born in the village of [[Pasinler, Erzurum|Passen]], near [[Erzurum]], and his mother, Satenig, was born in the village of Govdun, near [[Sivas]].&lt;ref name="Kevorkian, Jack 2009"&gt;{{cite book| title=glimmerIQs| author=Kevorkian, Jack| publisher=World Audience, Inc.| type=Paperback| year=2009| isbn=978-1-935444-88-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father left Armenia in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and made his way to Pontiac in 1912, where he found work at an automobile foundry. Satenig fled the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915, finding refuge with relatives in Paris, and eventually reuniting with her brother in Pontiac. Levon and Satenig met through the Armenian community in their city, where they married and began their family. The couple had a daughter, Margaret, in 1926, followed by son Jack – and, their third and last child, Flora.&lt;ref name="papers"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thekevorkianpapers.com/about/biography| title=Biography| author=Kevorkian, Jack| publisher=www.thekevorkianpapers.com/| date=December 15, 2010| accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- supported in all 3 following citations--&gt;

Kevorkian graduated from [[Pontiac Central High School]] with honors in 1945, at the age of 17. In 1952, he graduated from the [[University of Michigan Health System|University of Michigan Medical School]] in [[Ann Arbor]].&lt;ref name="Frontline_chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chermak"&gt;{{cite book| last=Chermak| first=Steven M.|author2=Bailey, Frankie Y. |title=Crimes and Trials of the Century| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group| year=2007| pages=101–102| isbn=0-313-34110-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="movhi1"&gt;{{cite book| last=Azadian| first=Edmond Y.|author2=Hacikyan, Agop J. |author3=Franchuk, Edward S. | title=History on the move: views, interviews and essays on Armenian issues| work=An Interview with Dr. Jack Kevorkian| publisher=Wayne State University Press| year=1999| location=Detroit| page=233| isbn=0-8143-2916-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KGciVUhpzXUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=History%20on%20the%20move%3A%20views%2C%20interviews%20and%20essays%20on%20Armenian%20issues.&amp;pg=PA233#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevorkian completed residency training in anatomical and clinical pathology and briefly conducted research on blood transfusion.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web| title=Jack Kevorkian Biography| publisher=Biography.com| url=http://www.biography.com/people/jack-kevorkian-9364141?page=1| year=2012| accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Over a period of decades, Kevorkian developed several controversial ideas related to death. In a 1959 journal article, he wrote:

{{quote|I propose that a prisoner condemned to death by due process of law be allowed to submit, by his own free choice, to medical experimentation under complete anaesthesia (at the time appointed for administering the penalty) as a form of execution in lieu of conventional methods prescribed by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kevorkian |first=Jack |title=Capital Punishment or Capital Gain |journal=The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science |date=May–June 1959 |volume=50 |issue=1| pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Senior doctors at the University of Michigan, Kevorkian's employer, opposed his proposal and Kevorkian chose to leave the University rather than stop advocating his ideas. Ultimately, he gained little support for his plan. He returned to the idea of using death row inmates for medical purposes after the Supreme Court's 1976 decision in ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' re-instituted the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]]. He advocated harvesting the organs from inmates after the death penalty was carried out for transplant into sick patients, but failed to gain the cooperation of prison officials.&lt;ref name=betzold&gt;{{cite news|last=Betzold |first=Michael |title=1993: Excerpt from 'Appointment with Doctor Death' |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20070527/NEWS05/70525033 |accessdate=29 April 2012 |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=19 September 1993 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108061240/http://www.freep.com/article/20070527/NEWS05/70525033 |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Pathology|pathologist]] at Pontiac General Hospital, Kevorkian experimented with transfusing blood from the recently deceased into live patients. He drew blood from corpses recently brought into the hospital and transferred it successfully into the bodies of hospital staff members. Kevorkian thought that the U.S. military might be interested in using this technique to help wounded soldiers during a battle, but the Pentagon was not interested.&lt;ref name=betzold/&gt;

In the 1980s, Kevorkian wrote a series of articles for the German journal ''Medicine and Law'' that laid out his thinking on the ethics of [[euthanasia]].&lt;ref name="Frontline_chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lessenberry1994"&gt;{{cite web|title=Death becomes him|author=Lessenberry, Jack |date=July 1994 |work=Vanity Fair |via=PBS.org |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/aboutk/vanityfair.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030806015344/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/aboutk/vanityfair.html |archivedate=August 6, 2003 |accessdate=July 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Kevorkian started advertising in [[Detroit]] newspapers as a physician consultant for "death counseling". His first public assisted suicide, of Janet Adkins, a 54-year-old woman diagnosed in 1989 with [[Alzheimer's disease]], took place in 1990. Charges of [[murder]] were dropped on December 13, 1990, as there were, at that time, no laws in Michigan regarding assisted suicide.&lt;ref name="ascension"&gt;{{cite web |title=People v. Kevorkian; Hobbins v. Attorney General |publisher=Ascension Health |year=1994 |accessdate=May 13, 2011 |url=http://www.ascensionhealth.org/ethics/public/cases/case19.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030908034403/http://www.ascensionhealth.org/ethics/public/cases/case19.asp |archivedate=September 8, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, however, the State of Michigan revoked Kevorkian's [[medical license]] and made it clear that given his actions, he was no longer permitted to practice medicine or to work with patients.&lt;ref name="APRevoked"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SZczAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HTIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=kevorkian%20michigan%20license%20revoked&amp;pg=5151%2C2383816 |title=Kevorkian medical license revoked |work=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]] |location=Michigan |page=8 |agency=Associated Press |date=November 21, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his lawyer [[Geoffrey Fieger]], Kevorkian assisted in the deaths of 130 terminally ill people between 1990 and 1998. In each of these cases, the individuals themselves allegedly took the final action which resulted in their own deaths. Kevorkian allegedly assisted only by attaching the individual to a [[euthanasia device]] that he had devised and constructed. The individual then pushed a button which released the drugs or chemicals that would end his or her own life. Two deaths were assisted by means of a device which delivered the euthanizing drugs [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]]. Kevorkian called the device a "[[Thanatron]]" ("Death machine", from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[thanatos]]'' meaning "death").&lt;ref name="thanatron"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/aboutk/thanatronblurb.html |title=The Kevorkian Verdict: The Thanatron |series=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] |network=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |date=May 1996 |accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people were assisted by a device which employed a [[gas]] mask fed by a canister of [[carbon monoxide]], which Kevorkian called the "[[Mercitron]]" ("Mercy machine").&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jack Kevorkian's Death Van and the Tech of Assisted Suicide |date=June 3, 2011 |first=Nicholas |last=Jackson |publisher=TheAtlantic.com |work=[[The Atlantic Monthly]] |accessdate=February 13, 2012 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/06/jack-kevorkians-death-van-and-the-tech-of-assisted-suicide/239897/}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- moved "this became necessary" claim to Talk --&gt;

According to a report by the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', 60% of the patients who died with Kevorkian's help were not terminally ill, and at least 13 had not complained of pain. The report further asserted that Kevorkian's counseling was too brief (with at least 19 patients dying less than 24 hours after first meeting Kevorkian) and lacked a psychiatric exam in at least 19 cases, 5 of which involved people with histories of depression, though Kevorkian was sometimes alerted that the patient was unhappy for reasons other than their medical condition. (In 1992, Kevorkian himself wrote that it is always necessary to consult a psychiatrist when performing assisted suicides because a person's "mental state is ... of paramount importance."&lt;ref name="DFP1"&gt;Cheyfitz, Kirk (March 3, 1997). [http://www.freep.com/article/20070527/NEWS05/70525061/SUICIDE-MACHINE-PART-1 "Suicide Machine, Part 1: Kevorkian rushes to fulfill his clients' desire to die"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608173811/http://www.freep.com/article/20070527/NEWS05/70525061/SUICIDE-MACHINE-PART-1 |date=June 8, 2011 }}. ''[[Detroit Free Press]]''. Archived May 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;) The report also stated that Kevorkian failed to refer at least 17 patients to a pain specialist after they complained of chronic pain, and sometimes failed to obtain a complete medical record for his patients, with at least three autopsies of suicides Kevorkian had assisted with showing the person who committed suicide to have no physical sign of disease. Rebecca Badger, a patient of Kevorkian's and a mentally troubled drug abuser, had been mistakenly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The report also stated that Janet Adkins, Kevorkian's first euthanasia patient, had been chosen without Kevorkian ever speaking to her, only with her husband, and that when Kevorkian first met Adkins two days before her assisted suicide he "made no real effort to discover whether Ms. Adkins wished to end her life," as the Michigan Court of Appeals put it in a 1995 ruling upholding an order against Kevorkian's activity.&lt;ref name="DFP1"/&gt; According to ''[[The Economist]]'': "Studies of those who sought out Dr. Kevorkian, however, suggest that though many had a worsening illness ... it was not usually terminal. Autopsies showed five people had no disease at all. ... Little over a third were in pain. Some presumably suffered from no more than hypochondria or depression."&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18802492 |title=Jack Kevorkian, champion of voluntary euthanasia, died on June 3rd, aged 83 |work=The Economist |date=June 9, 2011 |publisher=webCitation.org |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zijIM3U0?url=http://www.economist.com/node/18802492 |archivedate=June 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Kevorkian's attorney [[Geoffrey Fieger]] published an essay stating, "I've never met any doctor who lived by such exacting guidelines as Kevorkian ... he published them in an article for the American Journal of Forensic Psychiatry in 1992. Last year he got a committee of doctors, the Physicians of Mercy, to lay down new guidelines, which he scrupulously follows."&lt;ref name="DFP1"/&gt; However, Fieger stated that Kevorkian found it difficult to follow his "exacting guidelines" because of "persecution and prosecution", adding "[H]e's proposed these guidelines saying this is what ought to be done. These are not to be done in times of war, and we're at war."&lt;ref name="DFP1"/&gt;

In a 2010 interview with [[Sanjay Gupta]], Kevorkian stated an objection to the status of assisted suicide in [[Oregon Death with Dignity Act|Oregon]], [[Washington Death with Dignity Act|Washington]], and [[Baxter v. Montana|Montana]]. At that time, only in those three states was assisted suicide legal in the United States, and then only for terminally ill patients. To Gupta, Kevorkian stated, "What difference does it make if someone is terminal? We are all terminal."&lt;ref name="regrets"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/06/14/kevorkian.gupta/index.html| title=Kevorian: "I have no regrets"|publisher=CNN|date=June 14, 2010|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, a patient did not have to be terminally ill to be assisted in committing suicide, but needed to be suffering. However, he also said in that same interview that he declined four out of every five assisted suicide requests, on the grounds that the patient needed more treatment or medical records had to be checked.&lt;ref name="GuptaInterview"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/health/2011/06/03/bts.2010.gupta.kevorkian.cnn| title='Dr. Death's' view on life|publisher=CNN| date=June 14, 2010| accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, disability rights and anti-legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia group [[Not Dead Yet]] spoke out against Kevorkian, citing potentially concerning sentiments he expressed in his published writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notdeadyet.org/2011/06/little-bit-about-real-jack-kevorkian-in.html|title=A little bit about the REAL Jack Kevorkian – In His Own Words|date=June 7, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, on page 214 of ''Prescription: Medicide, the Goodness of Planned Death'', Kevorkian wrote that assisting "suffering or doomed persons kill themselves" was "merely the first step, an early distasteful professional obligation ... What I find most satisfying is the prospect of making possible the performance of invaluable experiments or other beneficial medical acts under conditions that this first unpleasant step can help establish – in a word obitiatry." In a journal article, ''The last fearsome taboo: Medical aspects of planned death'', Kevorkian also detailed anesthetizing, experimenting on, and utilizing the organs of a disabled newborn as a token of "daring and highly imaginative research" that would be possible "beyond the constraints of traditional but outmoded, hopelessly inadequate, and essentially irrelevant ethical codes now sustained for the most part by vacuous sentimental reverence."

The first public performance of the complete classical organ works by Jack Kevorkian was by Craig Rifel in a live concert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/39430967|title=Jack Kevorkian Preforms in Concert - Waterford Michigan 1996|first=Primeau|last=Productions|date=March 29, 2012|publisher=|via=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt; on January 30, 1996 at Central United Methodist Church in Waterford, Michigan, including Kevorkian's Prelude &amp; Fugue in E-flat, Pipe Dream, Sonata in D, Passacaglia on B-A-C-H, Pastorale &amp; Fugue in B-Flat, and Fantasy &amp; Fugue in C.

He was also an oil painter. His work tended toward the grotesque and surreal, and he had created pieces of symbolic art, such as one "of a child eating the flesh off a decomposing corpse."&lt;ref name="Lessenberry1994"/&gt; Of his known works, six were made available in the 1990s for print release. The Ariana Gallery in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], is the exclusive distributor of Kevorkian's artwork. The original oil prints are not for release.&lt;ref name="ArianaPR"&gt;{{cite press release| title=The Kevorkian Verdict: The Ariana Gallery| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/aboutk/art/gallerypress.html|series=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]| network=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]| date=May 1996| accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sludge metal]] band [[Acid Bath]] used his painting "For He is Raised" as the cover art for their 1996 album ''[[Paegan Terrorism Tactics]]''.&lt;ref name="brave"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/144225 |title=Acid Bath – Paegan Terrorism Tactics Remastered, Reissued |date=August 10, 2010 |work=[[Brave Words &amp; Bloody Knuckles|Brave Words]] |accessdate=June 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108061239/http://www.bravewords.com/news/144225 |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, his paintings became the center of a legal entanglement between his sole heir and a Massachusetts museum.&lt;ref name="estate"&gt;{{cite web| title=Kevorkian Estate To Auction Disputed Paintings| url=http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/Kevorkian-Estate-To-Auction-Disputed-Paintings/-/1719418/4187052/-/o47683z/-/index.html| publisher=ClickonDetroit.com| work=[[WDIV-TV]]| date=November 2, 2011| accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==
Kevorkian was tried four times for assisting suicides between May 1994 and June 1997. With the assistance of Fieger, Kevorkian was acquitted three times. The fourth trial ended in a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]].&lt;ref name=Schneider/&gt; The trials helped Kevorkian gain public support for his cause. After Oakland County prosecutor Richard Thompson lost a primary election to a Republican challenger,&lt;ref name="maine"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HyYgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7GoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5003,11529|title=Prosecutor has last shot at Dr. Death| location=Lewiston Maine| newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Sun Journal]]| page=3A| date=November 1, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson attributed the loss in part to the declining public support for the prosecution of Kevorkian and its associated legal expenses.&lt;ref name="USA19960808"&gt;{{cite news| last=Davis| first=Robert| date=August 8, 1996|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/16341398.html?dids=16341398:16341398&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+08%2C+1996&amp;author=Ron+Franklin%3B+Tom+Curley%3B+Robert+Davis&amp;pub=USA+TODAY+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=TWA+probe+could+turn+toward+wreckage+today| title=Assisted Suicide|work=USA Today| page=3A| accessdate=August 3, 2010| quote=Thompson, the first Oakland County prosecutor in 24 years to lose an election, agreed that the controversy clearly was an issue in his defeat.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction and imprisonment==
{{Euthanasia}}
On November 22, 1998, broadcast of [[CBS News]]' ''[[60 Minutes]]'', Kevorkian allowed the airing of a videotape he made on September 17, 1998, which depicted the [[voluntary euthanasia]] of Thomas Youk, 52, who was in the final stages of [[Lou Gehrig's disease]]. After Youk provided his fully [[informed consent]] (a sometimes complex legal determination made in this case by editorial consensus) on September 17, 1998, Kevorkian himself administered Thomas Youk a lethal injection. This was highly significant, as all of his earlier clients had reportedly completed the process themselves. During the videotape, Kevorkian dared the authorities to try to convict him or stop him from carrying out mercy killings. Youk's family described the lethal injection as humane, not murder.

On March 26, 1999, Kevorkian was charged with second-degree [[murder]] and the delivery of a [[controlled substance]] (administering the lethal injection to Thomas Youk).&lt;ref name="Frontline_chronology"&gt;{{cite episode| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/chronology.html |title=The Kevorian Verdict: A Chronology| series=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]| network=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]| date=May 1996| accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Kevorkian's [[medical license|license to practice medicine]] had been revoked eight years previously, he was not legally allowed to possess the controlled substance. As homicide law is relatively fixed and routine, this trial was markedly different from earlier ones that involved an area of law in flux (assisted suicide). Kevorkian discharged his attorneys and proceeded through the trial [[pro se|representing himself]], a decision he later regretted.&lt;ref name=Schneider/&gt; The judge ordered a criminal defense attorney to remain available at trial as [[standby counsel]] for information and advice. Inexperienced in law but persisting in his efforts to represent himself, Kevorkian encountered great difficulty in presenting his evidence and arguments. He was not able to call any witnesses to the stand as the judge did not deem the testimony of any of his witnesses relevant.&lt;ref name="Ucolo"&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher=71 U. Colo. L. Rev.| page=789| title=Pro Se Criminal Defendant, Standby Counsel, and the Judge: A Proposal for Better-Defined Roles, The| author=Williams, Marie Higgins| url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/ucollr71&amp;section=34| year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a two-day trial, the Michigan jury found Kevorkian guilty of second-degree homicide.&lt;ref name=Schneider/&gt; Judge Jessica Cooper sentenced Kevorkian to serve 10–25 years in prison and told him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a court of law and you said you invited yourself here to take a final stand. But this trial was not an opportunity for a referendum. The law prohibiting euthanasia was specifically reviewed and clarified by the Michigan Supreme Court several years ago in a decision involving your very own cases, sir. So the charge here should come as no surprise to you. You invited yourself to the wrong forum. Well, we are a nation of laws, and we are a nation that tolerates differences of opinion because we have a civilized and a nonviolent way of resolving our conflicts that weighs the law and adheres to the law. We have the means and the methods to protest the laws with which we disagree. You can criticize the law, you can write or lecture about the law, you can speak to the media or petition the voters.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kevorkian was sent to a prison in [[Coldwater, Michigan]], to serve his sentence.&lt;ref name="NYTstatement"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/14/us/statement-from-judge-to-kevorkian.html| title=Statement from Judge to Kevorkian| author=Jessica Cooper|work=The New York Times| date=April 14, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his conviction (and subsequent losses on appeal), Kevorkian was denied parole repeatedly until 2007.&lt;ref name="Detnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Egan|first=Paul|date=December 14, 2006| url=http://detnews.com/article/20061214/METRO/612140443/After-8-years--Kevorkian-to-go-free| title=After 8 years, Kevorkian to go free| work=[[The Detroit News]]| publisher=Detnews.com| accessdate=February 13, 2012}}{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[MSNBC]] interview aired on September 29, 2005, Kevorkian said that if he were granted parole, he would not resume directly helping people die and would restrict himself to campaigning to have the law changed. On December 22, 2005, Kevorkian was denied parole by a board on the count of 7–2 recommending not to give parole.&lt;ref name="cosby"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9532036|author=Rita Cosby| date=September 29, 2005| work=[[MSNBC]]| title='Dr. Death' speaks out from jail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] with [[Hepatitis C]], which he contracted while doing research on [[blood transfusion]]s in the 1960s, Kevorkian was expected to die within a year in May 2006.&lt;ref name="ettelt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifenews.com/bio1214.html |title=Jack Kevorkian Attorney Says His Health is in Serious Jeopardy |publisher=Lifenews.com |date=December 6, 2005 |author=Steven Ettelt |accessdate=February 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531075759/http://www.lifenews.com/bio1214.html |archivedate=May 31, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DFP" /&gt; After applying for a pardon, parole, or commutation by the parole board and Governor [[Jennifer Granholm]], he was paroled for good behavior on June 1, 2007.

Kevorkian was on parole for two years, under the conditions that he would not help anyone else die, or provide care for anyone older than 62 or disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18974940| title=Kevorkian released from prison after 8 years|publisher=MSNBC| work=[[MSNBC]]| date=June 1, 2007| accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevorkian said he would abstain from assisting any more terminal patients with death, and his role in the matter would strictly be to persuade states to change their laws on assisted suicide.

Director [[Barry Levinson]] and actors [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[John Goodman]], who appeared in ''[[You Don't Know Jack (film)|You Don't Know Jack]]'', a film based on Kevorkian's life, were interviewed alongside Kevorkian.

Kevorkian stated that both the film and Pacino's performance "brings tears to my eyes – and I lived through it".&lt;ref name="krieger"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lasisblog.com/2010/11/02/a-new-life-for-%E2%80%9Cdr-death%E2%80%9D/| title=A New Life for Dr. Death| author=Tara Krieger| date=November 2, 2010| accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional race 2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Michigan, 2008}}
On March 12, 2008, Kevorkian announced plans to run for [[United States Congress]] to represent [[Michigan's 9th congressional district]] as an independent against eight-term congressman [[Joe Knollenberg]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Bloomfield Hills]]), former [[Michigan Lottery]] commissioner and [[Michigan Senate|state senator]] [[Gary Peters (Michigan politician)|Gary Peters]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Bloomfield Township, Oakland County, Michigan|Bloomfield Township]]), Adam Goodman ([[Libertarian Party (United States)|L]]-[[Royal Oak, Michigan|Royal Oak]]) and [[Douglas Campbell (Michigan politician)|Douglas Campbell]] ([[Green Party (United States)|G]]-[[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]]). The race had already garnered national attention due to Democrats targeting the historically Republican district based in Oakland County, which Knollenberg barely won in 2006 against a little-known opponent, and which would suffer some of the worst brunt of the [[Great Recession]] due to [[Automotive industry crisis of 2008–10|declines in Detroit's automotive industry]]. Upon Kevorkian's entry into the race, one analyst viewed Kevorkian as a potential spoiler to Peters' candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23597181/ns/politics-decision_08/t/kevorkian-plans-congressional-run/#.WPL9BTFtmM8|title=Kevorkian plans congressional run|date=2008-03-13|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2017-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Kevorkian received 8,987 votes (2.6% of the vote) in the election, in which Peters defeated the incumbent Knollenberg by a nine-percent margin.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/candlist/08GEN/08GEN_CL.HTM| title=Official Michigan General Candidate Listing| publisher=Michigan Department of State| date=November 25, 2008| accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peters would eventually serve three terms in Congress before making a successful run for the United States Senate.

==Legacy==
Judge Thomas Jackson, who presided over Kevorkian's first murder trial in 1994, commented that he wanted to express sorrow at Kevorkian's death and that the 1994 case was brought under "a badly written law" aimed at Kevorkian, but he attempted to give him "the best trial possible." [[Geoffrey Fieger]], Kevorkian's lawyer during the 1990s, gave a speech at a press conference in which he stated: "Dr. Jack Kevorkian didn't seek out history, but he made history."&lt;ref name="legacy1"/&gt; Fieger said that Kevorkian revolutionized the concept of suicide by working to help people end their own suffering, because he believed physicians are responsible for alleviating the suffering of patients, even if that meant allowing patients to die.&lt;ref name="legacy1"/&gt; John Finn, medical director of palliative care at the Catholic&lt;ref name="stjohn"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stjohnprovidence.org/aboutsjh/mission/ |title=Mission and Values, St. John Health, as a Catholic health ministry |work=stjohnprovidence.org |year=2011 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. John's Hospital, said Kevorkian's methods were unorthodox and inappropriate. He added that many of Kevorkian's patients were isolated, lonely, and potentially depressed, and therefore in no state to mindfully choose whether to live or die.&lt;ref name="legacy1" /&gt; [[Derek Humphry]], author of the suicide handbook ''[[Final Exit]]'', said Kevorkian was "too obsessed, too fanatical, in his interest in death and suicide to offer direction for the nation."&lt;ref name="SparkedDebate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20110604/NEWS05/106040427 |title=Jack Kevorkian sparked a debate on death |date=June 4, 2011 |work=Detroit Free Press |accessdate=February 13, 2012 |publisher=Freep.com |author1=Joe Swickard |author2=Patricia Anstett |author3=L.L.

He started at a time when it was hardly talked about and got people thinking about the issue. He paid one hell of a price, and that is one of the hallmarks of true heroism."&lt;ref name="ABCobit"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Health/jack-kevorkian-godfather-die-movement-leaves-controversial-legacy/story?id=13752603 |title=Jack Kevorkian, Godfather of Right-to Die-Movement, Dies Leaving Controversial Legacy – ABC News |first= Susan |last=Donaldson James |publisher=ABC  | date=June 23, 2011| accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jason Philip Macendale, Jr.''' is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=March 2014}}
The character first appears in ''[[Machine Man]]'' #19 (Feb 1981), created by writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]]. In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #289 (June 1987) he switches identities from [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] to [[Hobgoblin (comics)|the Hobgoblin]].

The character was killed off in ''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'' #1 in order to make room for [[Roderick Kingsley]] to assume the Hobgoblin mantle. Writer [[Roger Stern]] recounted that he was initially uncertain of how to resolve the situation of there being two Hobgoblins: 

{{quote|When I was preparing to revisit the Hobgoblin, I went over the story that [[Howard Mackie|Howard [Mackie]]] and JR had done in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' #68, which was still fairly recent at the time, and I said to the editors, "Wow, they did all this work to revamp the second Hobgoblin—what do you want me to do? I can have Macendale beat my guy [Kingsley], anything you want, because you just went to all this trouble." I heard back and was told that I could open my story by having my guy ''kill'' Macendale. That left things pretty open![emphasis in original]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Greenberg|first= Glenn|authorlink= Glenn Greenberg|date= August 2009|title= When Hobby Met Spidey|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|page= 21|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Fictional character biography==
Jason Philip Macendale was a former CIA agent who was recruited out of college to become an agent for the organization. Macendale proved to be a liability to the organization, due to his violent nature and amoral personality. This rejection turned Macendale to become a mercenary and ultimately a costumed terrorist, as he adopted the costumed alter ego of [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Machine Man]]'' #19&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack O'Lantern became a regular nemesis for Spider-Man, meeting him in battle the first time in ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #56. He was later hired to retrieve the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]'s lost battle van and despite the untimely appearance of Spider-Man, pulled off the mission successfully.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #254&lt;/ref&gt;

Wishing to increase his underworld status, Macendale formed an alliance with the Hobgoblin, who at this time was using brainwashed journalist [[Ned Leeds]] as a proxy. The brainwashing treatments used on Ned Leeds to make him Hobgoblin began to affect his sanity, ultimately leading to him doublecrossing Macendale when the two were fleeing a horde of police officers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #286&lt;/ref&gt; Macendale vowed revenge against Ned Leeds, ultimately hiring the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] to have him killed. Upon killing Leeds, all known copies of the Hobgoblin's weapons and costumes were handed over to Macendale, who took over the identity in order to steal Ned's notoriety within the supervillain community.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #289, ''Spider-Man Vs Wolverine''&lt;/ref&gt;

Macendale's scheme was foiled; he was exposed as the new Hobgoblin, and lost a battle against Spider-Man which was meant to prove his ability.&lt;ref&gt;''Web of Spider-Man'' #38&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding he needed the original Hobgoblin's powers if he was to match his reputation, Macendale attempted to steal the [[Green Goblin]]'s secret formula for superhuman strength, resulting in a confrontation between himself and [[Harry Osborn]], the second Green Goblin. Green Goblin overcame the Hobgoblin.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #312&lt;/ref&gt;

Dejected and humiliated, Macendale offered to sell his [[soul]] to [[N'astirh]], a demon leading [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|an invasion of Manhattan]], in exchange for the power of a demon. N'astirh fused a demon to Macendale.&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #147&lt;/ref&gt; Enhanced by the demon's power, but horrified to see his once handsome face transformed into a demonic one, Macendale blamed his suffering on Spider-Man and hunted him down for revenge. With his new demonic powers, he defeated Spider-Man easily, but [[Mary Jane Watson]] intervened before he could deliver the killing blow.&lt;ref&gt;''Web of Spider-Man'' #48&lt;/ref&gt;

Macendale put aside his personal enmity for Spider-Man, and used his new demonic powers to become a top contract killer.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #161&lt;/ref&gt; As an independent mercenary and criminal, Macendale would clash with many other heroes, including [[Ghost Rider]],&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man'' #6-7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]], [[Doctor Strange]],&lt;ref&gt;''Dr. Strange'' (vol. 3) #11&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Darkhawk]]. He would also join two reformed incarnations of the Sinister Six.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #335-339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man'' #18-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Macendale's personality was overcome by the insane demon who shared his body, and he began to consider himself an agent of God sent to Earth to kill sinners. This led him into conflict with Ghost Riders [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] and Spider-Man; during the battle, a blast from Johnny Blaze's "Hellfire Shotgun" destabilized the demon within Macendale, long enough for him to briefly regain his sanity.

During a fight between Macendale, Spider-Man, [[Moon Knight]], and Doctor Strange, the heroes realized that Macendale's insanity was partly caused by despair over losing his handsome face. To try to calm the monstrous man/demon, Doctor Strange agreed to cast an illusion spell upon Macendale that caused Macendale to see his true face in reflections of himself. This helped Macendale enough that he was ultimately able to expel the demon from within himself, with the demon referring to itself as the [[Demogoblin]]. As Hobgoblin, Macendale was stiff-armed by [[Doctor Octopus]] into joining the 2nd incarnation of the group the Sinister Six, which twice tried to take over the world, failing due to counter measures by Spider-Man, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Ghost Rider, the [[Fantastic Four]], and many more heroes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #335-339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man'' #18-23&lt;/ref&gt; In a rare event, Macendale teamed up with Spider-Man to defeat the duo of Demogoblin and [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man'' #24, ''Spirits of Vengeance'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

Next the Hobgoblin was hired by the Foreigner to assassinate Moon Knight and Nick Katzenberg, only to be stopped by Moon Knight and Spider-Man. Spider-Man turned him over to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''Web of Spider-Man'' #93-96, ''Spirits of Vengeance'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Macendale obtained the strength formula of [[Kraven the Hunter]], which enabled him to easily defeat his demonic doppelganger, Demogoblin, who then died saving a young child in battle.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man'' #47-49&lt;/ref&gt;

Macendale was defeated once more by Spider-Man along with [[Coldheart]], during an attempt to kidnap Macendale's long-lost son. However, Macendale's reunion would be an unhappy one as Macendale attempted (unsuccessfully) to use his son as a hostage to avoid going back to jail. He would remain in jail for some time before being freed by [[Mendel Stromm|Gaunt]], sending him into combat against the new Spider-Man, [[Ben Reilly]]. In exchange for doing Gaunt's bidding, the scientist turned Macendale into a cyborg, complete with removal of one of Macendale's eyes with a new high-tech cybernetic eye. He failed however and was once again arrested.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #411&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man'' #68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason Macendale went on trial for his many crimes. Found guilty on several counts, including convictions for acts caused by both the Roderick and Leeds Hobgoblins, a disgusted Macendale responded by revealing that Ned Leeds "was" Hobgoblin. [[Roderick Kingsley]], fearful that Macendale's continued testimony could expose him as the original Hobgoblin, broke into prison and murdered Macendale.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives #1''&lt;/ref&gt;

A bank robbing Jack O'Lantern initially misidentified as Macendale is captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]''. This individual was using several false aliases including Jason Macendale, Maguire Beck ([[Mysterio]]'s cousin), and Mad Jack (Daniel Berkhart). The true identify of this Jack O'Lantern was never revealed but it was not any of the aliases he was using.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic

==Powers and abilities==
Macendale originally possessed no superhuman powers, but used similar paraphernalia to the Hobgoblin and Green Goblin; in both his Jack O'Lantern and Hobgoblin persona he used a rocket-powered glider, pumpkin bombs, and gauntlet blasters.

During the time in which a demon was grafted to him, he had superhuman strength, speed, and agility, as well as hellfire powers enabling him to create weapons and gliders at will. In one story it is implied that his demonic abilities allowed him to create organic fibers strong enough to bind a normal person.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

After Macendale acquired the formula of Kraven the Hunter, he had enhanced his strength, speed, stamina, durability, reflexes, and agility to superhuman levels which were greater than Kraven's, thanks to anomalies in his blood left over when he and Demogoblin were one, but the formula's effects seemed to have later wore off like it would with Kraven. His later cybernetically enhanced body further increased his strength, speed, reflexes, durability, and stamina.

==Personality, skills, and training==
Macendale had extensive military training in hand-to-hand combat, martial arts, espionage, and knowledge of conventional weaponry. He often used conventional military weapons. When he adopted the Hobgoblin persona, he was able to make improvements to the maneuverability of the goblin glider by utilizing skills he gained from his master's degrees in both mechanical engineering and physics.

Macendale was a [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]] and a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]], which led to his dishonorable discharge from the military.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Two versions of the Jason Macendale incarnation of Hobgoblin appear in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]. He appeared in the episodes "The Hobgoblin" Parts 1 and 2, "The Mutant Agenda", "Mutant's Revenge", "The Spot", and "Goblin War". In this continuity, he came before the Green Goblin but his weapons and glider were supplied by [[Norman Osborn]]. The Hobgoblin's voice and sense of humor is similar to [[the Joker (comics)|the Joker]] in ''[[Batman The Animated Series]]'', another character Hamill voiced. Unlike Green Goblin, he had no enhanced strength or split personality, preferring the traditional goblin gadgetry and laser pistols. In "Rocket Racer", Jason (originally introducing himself as "Jason Phillips") appeared when he starts dating [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Felicia Hardy]]. In "Goblin War", Hobgoblin's identity was ultimately revealed to be Macendale when he became engaged to Felicia Hardy by the end of the third season. Felicia stumbles upon his secret but it's ultimately exposed by Green Goblin's return who captures both of them. After Green Goblin escapes, Felicia breaks up with Jason and he is then arrested by the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]. An alternate version of the character appeared in "I Really, Really Hate Clones" where he was shown working for Spider-Carnage alongside Green Goblin.

===Video games===
* The [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six]]'' had the third line-up of the [[Sinister Six]], which included Macendale.

===Toys===
* The demonic version of Macendale appears in the [[Spider-Man Classics]] line. This was reworked for the Sinister Six [[Marvel Legends]] set and then repainted for the Demogoblin figure.

'''John Cavil''' ('''Number One''') is a [[fictional character]] and the main [[antagonist]] from the re-imagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' television series. He is portrayed by [[Dean Stockwell]]. In the fourth-season episode "[[Six of One (Battlestar Galactica)|Six of One]]", Cavil's model number was revealed as Number One.

== Background ==
John Cavil, aka Number One, is a humanoid [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylon]] model that appears as a highly rational, eccentric man in his late-sixties. The Cavils have a heavy sarcastic demeanor and a sense of humor. They take neither religion nor death seriously and are the only [[atheism|atheist]] Cylon model. A Cavil is first seen aboard the Galactica assuming the role of a priest, offering spiritual guidance, and going by the name "Brother Cavil".

One of the unique characteristics of the Cavils is the sadistic, cruel and [[Machiavellian]] streak in their personalities. The Cavils openly mock their fellow Cylons every time they attempt contact with humans, even when it is absolutely necessary.

Even though they view death as only a nuisance, the Cavils are extremely displeased with pain (placing the blame on the [[Final Five Cylons|Final Five]]). This view fuels the idea that the Cavils wanted death to the humans to be as quick as possible, but were unprepared for the aftermath. Their attitude towards mankind's mortality, rather than irrational hatred, derives from their overall lack of knowledge about absolute death and the consequences that it carries. As revealed on ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan]]'', the Cavil that was stationed in [[Caprica]] learns from [[Samuel Anders]] the motives for the resistance; that humans do not leave anyone behind, even their dead. Respecting their resilience, the ''Caprica'' Cavil agrees with [[Caprica Six]] and [[Sharon Valerii]] (Boomer) to abandon the Colonies. Disappointed with the other Cylon models after failing to accomplish anything through boycott and sabotage, the ''Galactica'' Cavil fails to learn any lesson. As they are discovered and airlocked from Galactica, ''Galactica'' Cavil swears to "box" ''Caprica'' Cavil for his insubordination and is indicated to be the same Cavil that is the main enemy of season four given his plans to destroy humanity once and for all once he resurrects.

It is later implied in the series that the Cavils, akin to their creators, lack superhuman strength, and are actually the least likely to defend themselves. It is also implied that the Cavil who led the Civil War, and who killed himself in the CIC when he realized he was losing and had no chance of winning, is the resurrected ''Galactica'' Cavil.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Like the [[Number Four (Battlestar Galactica)|Simons]] and [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Threes]], and in contrast to [[Leoben Conoy|Leobens]], [[Aaron Doral|Dorals]], [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Sixes]], and [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Eights]], Cavils appear to be relatively uncommon and seldom appear in large groups, though in the third-season episode "Rapture" a large number were seen presumably taking care of the boxing of the three line of Cylons.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The Cavils' superior awareness of all situations (attributable to their being the only human model Cylon with full knowledge of their origin) and uncanny manipulative traits make their series the de facto leaders of the Cylons. However, their vast superiority and manipulations over their fellow Cylons goes beyond comprehension, as they manage to annihilate the Twelve Colonies and repeatedly attack the survivors without hurting the Final Five, and ensure their survival only to make them 'the ones who suffer the most', and basically carrying on with the annihilation of billions only to teach their creators a lesson.

A comment made by Sharon "Boomer" Valerii indicates the Cavils are against the idea of the Cylons reproducing themselves biologically, which makes sense given their distaste for human traits as well as lack of faith in the Cylon god, whose commandments include, "Be fruitful." Ellen Tigh also mentions that the idea that the only hope for the future of the Cylon race might be 'messy biological reproduction' is too much for Cavil.

Cavil is very insistent the Cylons not seek out or discuss the Final Five models. He also actively tries to prevent D'Anna from learning their identities, even threatening her at gunpoint in "Rapture". After she sees their faces, he boxes her before she can tell anyone, while claiming support from the other Cylons. The reason is he knows the identities of the Final Five and doesn't want them exposed (he’s waiting until they've learned their "lesson.")

== Character biography ==
Two versions of Cavil appear at the end of the second season &amp;ndash; in the two-part episode "[[Lay Down Your Burdens (Battlestar Galactica)|Lay Down Your Burdens]]." His first appearance is as a religious counselor provided by the fleet, with whom [[Galen Tyrol|Chief Tyrol]] meets after he physically attacks deck hand [[Cally Henderson Tyrol|Cally Henderson]] when she awakens him from a recurring nightmare. Tyrol states he dreams of killing himself, and Cavil suggests Tyrol subconsciously believes he is a Cylon sleeper agent like his former girlfriend [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon "Boomer" Valerii|Sharon "Boomer" Valerii]].

Cavil assures Tyrol he is no Cylon, joking "I've never seen you at any of the [Cylon] meetings." Despite posing as a priest, Cavil is critical of the [[Lords of Kobol (Battlestar Galactica)|Lords of Kobol]], telling Tyrol praying to them will not help. Cavil states humans have been given the choice to decide their own destinies, and the Lords play no part in their affairs. Cavil later meets with [[Laura Roslin|President Laura Roslin]], and offers prayers to the Lords of Kobol for Roslin's success in her presidential campaign against Gaius Baltar.

A second version of Cavil appears among the survivors from [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#Caprica|Caprica]] after [[Kara Thrace|Kara "Starbuck" Thrace]] leads a rescue mission to the planet. During a Cylon attack, the Cylons suddenly cease fire and withdraw. The Cavil among the group announces the Cylons have left Caprica, and that the group has been spared. Upon their return to the fleet, Chief Tyrol spots the second Cavil disembarking from a [[Colonial Raptor|Raptor]], and alerts the guards he is a Cylon. ''Caprica'' Cavil admits to being a Cylon with a message for their leader. [[William Adama|Admiral Adama]] has the man taken to the brig. Meanwhile, ''Galactica'' Cavil is arrested, and emphatically protests his innocence until he sees another copy of himself in the brig. He simply says "Oh, well...okay then," and calmly enters the cell.

Caprica Cavil gives a message to Roslin, stating the Cylon attack on the Colonies, as well as pursuit of the fleet, was an error. Cavil further explains two Cylon heroes, the Number Six model known as Caprica Six and Number Eight (that version of Sharon "Boomer" Valerii that was stationed on ''Galactica'' and shot Admiral Adama), have convinced them the war is futile. He states though the Cylons are machines, they strive to be the best machines possible, and believe they will one day rise above their creators. Their first step had been to replace the humans, and they believed they could do this by hijacking their lives and taking their places. They have determined, however, they have become no better than the creators they despise, and offer a reprieve from the genocide, suggesting that human and Cylon go their separate ways.

Adama and Roslin furiously reject the idea, stating they simply cannot walk away after the Cylons have destroyed their home worlds. Adama asks the two Cavils whether the new plan comes from their God, and Cavil says "there is no God. Supernatural divinities are the primitive's answer to why the sun goes down at night...or at least that's what we've been telling the others for years," although he acknowledges neither position can be proven. Despite the apparent sincerity of the message, and the offer of truce, Roslin orders both Cavils to be [[Space exposure#In science fiction|airlocked]], suggesting they will rapidly discover whether or not God exists. The actual disposal through the airlock is not shown on screen, but is shown in the film ''The Plan''. ''Galactica'' Cavil reveals that there is a Resurrection Ship nearby and, given his comments, his resurrected self is likely the one that leads the Civil War.

At least two Cavil versions are present on [[New Caprica]] during the Cylon occupation. The New Caprica Cavils display particularly venomous anti-human sentiments, taking great pleasure in taunting human prisoners and shrugging off the human casualties of insurgent suicide bombings. One Cavil in particular takes pleasure in blackmailing [[Ellen Tigh]] for sexual favors in exchange for releasing her husband [[Saul Tigh|Saul]] from captivity and not killing him. Saul Tigh is eventually released, having lost his right eye.

Later in the season, Cavil is one of three Cylons to board ''Galactica'' to meet with [[William Adama]] and [[Laura Roslin]] about the Eye of Jupiter artifiact. He is willing to hand [[Gaius Baltar]] over to the humans as part of a deal for the relic, "to sweeten the pot." Upon returning to his [[Cylon Basestar (re-imagining)|Basestar]], Cavil feels that the annihilation of ''Galactica'' is the best option, given the standoff, because Cylons are machines, and can wait out the human fleet.

In "[[Rapture (Battlestar Galactica)|Rapture]], Cavil finds [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|D'Anna]] in the temple on the Algae Planet, and, realizing she has come to discover the identities of the Final Five, he orders her at gunpoint not to proceed any further. However, Baltar shoots him from behind, and D'Anna finally sees their faces, but she loses consciousness and dies shortly thereafter.

Cavil is present as D'Anna resurrects. He states all members of her line, the [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Threes]] are fundamentally flawed, and suffer from messianic delusions. He claims he and the other Cylon models agree the Number Threes must all be "boxed" &amp;ndash; deactivated, with their memories placed into cold storage. The boxing is carried out by Cavil.

Cavil takes a major role in Season Four, as the leader and head negotiator of one of the two warring Cylon factions. In "[[Six of One (Battlestar Galactica)|Six of One]]," [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Natalie|Natalie]], the leader of the opposing faction, demands he stop lobotomizing the [[Cylon Raider|Raiders]], and reveals that she has restored free will to the [[Cylon (reimagining)#Centurions|Centurions]]. The Centurions then slaughter Cavil and the other Cylons in the room.

Cavil resurrects in "[[The Ties That Bind (Battlestar Galactica)|The Ties That Bind]]," and claims that, although he does not agree with Natalie and her followers, he will respect their wishes. The [[Number Two (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Twos]], [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Sixes]] and [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Eights]] (except [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon "Boomer" Valerii|Boomer]]) demand the Threes be unboxed to end the deadlock. Cavil seemingly acquiesces but, in reality, sets a trap to destroy Natalie and her followers. Boomer starts to have second thoughts about going against her fellow Eights. However, Cavil, who has developed a relationship with her, encourages her to embrace her true nature as a machine, and abandon her emotions.&lt;ref name="cb090213"&gt;{{cite news | first = Kelly | last = West | url = http://www.cinemablend.com/television/TV-Recap-Battlestar-Galactica-No-Exit-15300.html | title = TV Recap: Battlestar Galactica - No Exit | date = 2009-02-13 | work = Cinema Blend | accessdate = 2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natalie survives the attack, and a civil war ensues. D'Anna is unboxed by Cavil in "[[The Hub (Battlestar Galactica)|The Hub]]". Cavil hopes she will be able to mediate peace between the warring Cylon factions, but she kills him and escapes with Helo and a Number Eight.

In "[[No Exit (Battlestar Galactica)|No Exit]]", it is revealed [[Ellen Tigh]] was involved in the creation of Cavil, modelling him after the image of her own father, John. Cavil was the first of a new generation of Cylons, and he assisted in the creation of models Two to Eight. Because Ellen Tigh favored the [[Number Seven (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Seven (Daniel)]] model, Cavil's jealousy grew and he had the entire line destroyed by tampering with the [[amniotic fluid]] housing the Daniel copies.&lt;ref name="ew090214"/&gt; Cavil was also responsible for the [[Cylon (reimagining)#The "Final Five" Humanoid Cylons (Samuel Anders, Galen Tyrol, Tory Foster, Saul Tigh, Ellen Tigh)|Final Five]] being banished to live as humans. His rage fueled in part by the Final Five condemning him to an existence complete with all of humanity's weaknesses,&lt;ref name="ew090214"/&gt; and realizing the Five would try to avert another war against the humans,&lt;ref name="ew090214"&gt;{{cite news | first = Marc | last = Bernardin | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20259126,00.html | title = 'Battlestar Galactica' Recap: Baker's Dozen | date = 2009-02-13 | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate = 2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; he killed them and when they resurrected, he erased their memories and left them among the humans so they could witness the eventual genocide of the human race.&lt;ref name="nj090214"/&gt; Cavil manipulated his "parents", the Final Five, to be among those who suffered the most.&lt;ref name="nj090214"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pd090214"&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Murphy |url=http://blogs.pressdemocrat.com/default.asp?item=2333193 |title=About last night: "Battlestar Galactica" |date=2009-02-14 |work=[[The Press Democrat]] |accessdate=2009-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226151838/http://blogs.pressdemocrat.com/default.asp?item=2333193 |archivedate=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also speculated (although never explicitly stated) Cavil was the one who programmed models Two to Eight to not seek out or discuss the Final Five.&lt;ref name="nj090214"&gt;{{cite news | first = Alan | last = Sepinwall | url = http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/02/battlestar_galactica_no_exit_t.html | title = Battlestar Galactica, "No Exit": The areas of my Cylon expertise | date = 2009-02-14 | work = [[The Star-Ledger]] | accessdate = 2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has been confirmed in an interview with writer Ryan Mottesheard:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"John/Cavil is the only one who knows the Final Five because he corrupted the programming of the other six models to never speak of the Final Five or search for their identities. Obviously, if they did, then his little house of cards topples, which is why he boxed D’Anna."&lt;ref name="ct090215"&gt;{{cite news | first = Maureen | last = Ryan | url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/02/battlestar-galactica-no-exit-ellen-cavil-boomer.html | title = You asked, they answered: 'Battlestar Galactica' writers take on your 'No Exit' questions | date = 2009-02-15 | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | accessdate = 2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After [[Ellen Tigh]] is poisoned by her husband, she resurrects aboard one of Cavil's ships and is held prisoner there for 18 months ([[No Exit (Battlestar Galactica)|No Exit]]). In the process of downloading to a new body, Ellen regains the memories Cavil had erased.&lt;ref name="ct090215"/&gt; Later, when the Cylons' resurrection capability is destroyed, Cavil attempts to acquire Ellen's knowledge of the technology (she and the other Final Five being the ones who developed the ability to resurrect). Cavil plans to kill Ellen and recover the information from her brain. [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon "Boomer" Valerii|Boomer]] seemingly rebels against him and helps Ellen escape. It is later revealed, however, Ellen's escape was orchestrated by Cavil to sneak Boomer onto ''Galactica'' in order to kidnap Hera Agathon.

It is stated by Ellen in No Exit that Cavil is a sadist who enjoys playing mind games with the Final Five as evidenced by him taking Galen Tyrol's confession, a copy following Sam Anders in the resistance, torturing Tigh on New Caprica as well as extorting Ellen for sexual favors. He is also responsible for her being placed on a ship as it was leaving a destroyed Colony as part of his manipulations of the Final Five.

Cavil fully embraces his identity as a machine and believes humans are inherently lesser than Cylons,&lt;ref name="nj090214"/&gt; dismissing Ellen's arguments that humans, for all their imperfections, have something real and precious: Love, compassion, creativity, emotion.&lt;ref name="ct090214"&gt;{{cite news | first = Maureen | last = Ryan | url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/02/battlestar-galactica-no-exit-.html | title = Battlestar Galactica, "No Exit": The areas of my Cylon expertise | date = 2009-02-14 | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | accessdate = 2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Cavil has echoes of the story of [[Oedipus]].&lt;ref name="pd090214"/&gt; Alan Sepinwall of [[The Star-Ledger]] sees Cavil as "a cruel hybrid of the Biblical Cain (he murdered his brother, and his mother is fond of apples), Oedipus (has sex with his mother, though the eye he puts out belongs to his father) and a kind of [[Pinocchio]] in reverse."&lt;ref name="nj090214"/&gt;

Cavil wants Hera, as he sees her as the only chance for the Cylon race to continue, following the destruction of Resurrection. After Boomer helps Hera escape, Cavil personally leads a boarding party onto ''Galactica'' to retrieve her. In ''Galactica'''s CIC, Cavil is captured, while a Simon and Doral with him are killed by the bridge crew. Cavil takes advantage of an explosion to take a gun from a Colonial Marine guard, after knocking him down, and takes Hera hostage. Baltar lowers his side arm, and tries to convince Cavil to end the cycle of violence, and end the standoff on the bridge; Cavil begins to waver from Baltar's speech, but he refuses &amp;ndash; without Hera, he believes his race will end.

Tigh offers Cavil Resurrection technology if he releases Hera and stops pursuing humanity. Cavil agrees, and calls off his troops, saying he's a man of his word. Cavil becomes impatient, and sarcastically tells the Final Five Cylons to "hurry up" their discussions, as they are "keeping two civilizations waiting." As the Final Five come together to generate the data necessary for Resurrection technology, Tyrol, discovering Tory was responsible for the death of his wife Cally, breaks the link and kills her. Cavil realizes that, since each of the Final Five possessed part of the secret to Resurrection, that in killing one, then the secret of Resurrection has effectively been lost with the death of Tory.

At that very moment, the Cylon Colony is hit by a barrage of ''Galactica'''s remaining nuclear warheads fired by Racetrack's Raptor, which knocks the Colony out of orbit, and dooms it to be swallowed by the black hole. The surviving Simon and Doral, deciding the whole process has been a trick, recommence the battle with the humans, and are gunned down. Cavil shouts "Frak!", puts his gun into his mouth, and commits suicide.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin:  ''Laonastes aenigmamus'', [[Lao alphabet|Lao]]:  ຂະຍຸ), sometimes called the "rat-squirrel", is a [[rodent]] [[species]] of the [[Khammouan]] region of [[Laos]].  The species was first described in a 2005 article by Paulina Jenkins and coauthors, who considered the animal to be so distinct from all living rodents, they placed it in a new [[Family (biology)|family]], [[Laonastidae]]. It is in the [[monotypic]] genus ''Laonastes''.

[[File:Laonastes aenigmamus skull.jpg|thumb|right|Skull of ''L. aenigmamus'']]
In 2006, the classification of the Laotian rock rat was disputed by [[Mary Dawson (paleontologist)|Mary Dawson]] and coauthors.  Dawson and her colleagues suggested instead it belongs to the ancient fossil family [[Diatomyidae]], that was thought to have been extinct for 11 million years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the late [[Miocene]]. It would thereby represent a [[Lazarus species]].  The animals resemble large, dark [[rat]]s with hairy, thick [[tail]]s like those of a [[squirrel]].  Their [[skull]]s are very distinctive and have features that separate them from all other living [[mammals]].

== Classification ==
Upon their initial discovery, Jenkins and coauthors (2005) considered the Laotian rock rat to represent a completely new family.  The discovery of a new species of an extant mammal [[genus]] happens periodically, such as with the [[leaf muntjac]] or [[saola]].  The discovery of a completely new family is, by comparison, much more unusual. The most recent incident before the discovery of the family Laonastidae by Western science was the discovery of the [[Bumblebee Bat|bumblebee bat]] (''Craseonycteris thonglongyai''; family [[Bumblebee Bat|Craseonycteridae]]) in 1974. The only other examples from the 20th century are species that are only considered distinct families by a few authorities. These discoveries are: the [[Chinese river dolphin]] (''Lipotes vexillifer''; family Lipotidae) in 1918, the [[Zagros Mountains Mouse-like Hamster|Zagros mouse-like hamster]] (''Calomyscus bailwardi''; family Calomyscidae) in 1905, and [[Goeldi's marmoset]] (''Callimico goeldii''; family Callimiconidae) in 1904. Representatives from all the remaining rodent families with living representatives (approximately 30) were discovered before 1900.

Jenkins ''et al.'' (2004) did not compare the specimens to known rodent fossils.  After such a comparison, Dawson ''et al.'' (2006) were of the opinion that the Laotian rock rat belongs to a previously described family which had only been known from fossils, the [[Diatomyidae]].  The Diatomyidae are known from a series of fossils from the early [[Oligocene]] (~32.5 [[mya (unit)|mya]]) until the [[Miocene]] (~11 mya).  The discovery of the Laotian rock rat means an 11 million-year gap exists in the fossil record where no diatomyids have been found.  Dawson ''et al.'' (2006) described the Diatomyidae as a [[Lazarus taxon]] due to this gap. The only other mammal Lazarus taxon with a comparable time gap between it and its most recently known fossil relative is the [[monito del monte]], which is part of a marsupial family ([[Microbiotheriidae]]) also most recently known from Miocene deposits. Mary Dawson described ''Laonastes'' as the "[[coelacanth]] of rodents".&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/11746910/ (MSNBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of [[mtDNA]] [[12S rRNA]] and [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] [[DNA sequence|sequence]] by Jenkins ''et al.'' (2004) allied ''Laonastes'' with African [[hystricognath]] rodents, namely the [[blesmol]]s and the [[dassie rat]]. Support for such a placement was fair, but the exact position could not be resolved. Huchon ''et al.'' (2007) conducted a large-scale molecular phylogeny of rodents, including representatives of all major rodent taxonomic groups, based on 5.5 kb of sequence data from four nuclear and two mitochondrial genes, and a short, interspersed element, insertion analysis including 11 informative loci. Their molecular data place ''Laonastes'' robustly as a sister [[clade]] of [[Ctenodactylidae]], and support an ancient divergence during the [[Lutetian]] (Early/Middle Eocene, ~44 mya). The earlier molecular study was in error due to [[long branch attraction]] and inadequate sampling.

== Etymology ==
The genus name for this animal, ''Laonastes'', means "inhabitant of stone" (from [[Greek language|Greek]] λαας = ''laas'' = stone, gen: λαος = ''laos'' = of stone and [[Greek language|Greek]] ναστης = ''nastes'' = inhabitant). This is in reference to its presence around limestone rocks and also to the country where it was recently discovered. The specific epithet ''aenigmamus'' means "enigma mouse" (from Greek αινιγμα = ''ænigma'' and μυς = ''mus'', "mouse") referring to its unknown position among the rodents (Jenkins ''et al.'', 2004).

== Discovery ==
The first specimens were found for sale as meat at a market in [[Thakhek|Thakhek, Khammouan]], in 1996.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Remains of three additional animals were obtained in 1998 from villagers and in an [[owl pellet]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Return trips to Laos by the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] researchers uncovered several other specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4884052.stm | title = New pictures of 'living fossil' | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 2006-04-06 | accessdate = 2006-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new discoveries have prompted the suggestion that the animals may not be as rare as once thought. On June 13, 2006, David Redfield, a [[professor emeritus]] of [[Florida State University]], and Thai wildlife biologist Uthai Treesucon announced they had captured, photographed and videotaped a live specimen of the species in the village of [[Doy, Laos|Doy]] in Laos.&lt;ref name="Florida State University"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.rinr.fsu.edu/rockrat/ | title = "Living Fossil" captured live on video | publisher = [[Florida State University]] | date = 2006-06-13 | accessdate = 2006-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The animals look generally like rats, with thick, furred tails similar to a squirrel's, but limp. The head is large, with round ears and a somewhat bulbous bridge of the nose, and very long [[whisker]]s. Their fur is dark [[slate grey]], with a blackish tail. The belly is lighter, with a small, whitish area in the center. Their eyes are beady and black. They are about {{convert|26|cm|abbr=on}} long with a {{convert|14|cm|abbr=on}} tail and weigh about {{convert|400|g|abbr=on}}.  Jenkins ''et al.'' (2004) described the jaw as [[hystricognathous]], but Dawson ''et al.'' (2006) argued it is [[sciurognathous]].  The [[infraorbital foramen]] is enlarged, consistent with a [[hystricomorphous]] [[zygomasseteric system]].  The [[pterygoid fossa]]e do not connect to the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]], setting them apart from the hystricognathous rodents.

== Distribution ==
The Laotian Rock rat is found in [[limestone]] [[Karst topography|karsts]] of [[Khammouan Province]] and southern [[Bolikhamxai Province]], [[Laos]], and also in a small area of [[Minh Hóa District]], western [[Quảng Bình Province]], [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=IUCN&gt;{{IUCN2008 |assessor = Mittermeier, R. A. |assessor2 = Rylands, A. B. |last-assessor-amp = yes | year = 2008 | title = Callimico goeldii | id=3564 | downloaded = 2 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Vietnam, it is found in the 5 communes (''[[xã]]'') of [[Thượng Hoá]], [[Hóa Sơn]], [[Trung Hoá]], [[Hóa Hợp]], and [[Dân Hoá]], and in [[:vi:Vườn quốc gia Phong Nha - Kẻ Bàng|Phong Nha - Kẻ Bàng National Park]], near the villages of the [[Vietic languages|Vietic]]-speaking [[Ruc language|Ruc]], [[Sach language|Sach]], and [[Chut language|Chut]] ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Nguyen"&gt;Nguyen, D. X., Nguyen, N. X., Nguyen, D. D., Dinh, T. H., Le, D. T., &amp; Dinh, D. H. (2014). Distribution and habitat of the Laotian Rock Rat Laonastes aenigmamus Jenkins, Kilpatrick, Robinson &amp; Timmins, 2005 (Rodentia: Diatomyidae) in Vietnam. Biodiversity Data Journal, (2), e4188. Advance online publication. http://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.2.e4188&lt;/ref&gt; It is also found directly across the border in [[Hin Namno]] National Biodiversity Conservation Area, Laos. In Laos, it is most common in the [[Phou Hin Poun National Biodiversity Conservation Area]]. Nguyen et al. (2014)&lt;ref name="Nguyen"/&gt; suggests that the Quảng Bình and Phou Hin Poun populations may be distinct and genetically isolated from each other.

Nicolas et al. (2012) found 8 major geographical [[clade]]s and 8 to 16 [[evolutionary significant unit]]s among Laotian rock rat populations in Laos, and suggests that ''Laonastes'' may in fact consist of various undescribed [[cryptic species]].&lt;ref name="Nicolas2012"&gt;Nicolas V, Herbreteau V, Couloux A, Keovichit K, Douangboupha B, Hugot J-P (2012) A Remarkable Case of Micro-Endemism in Laonastes aenigmamus (Diatomyidae, Rodentia) Revealed by Nuclear and Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Data. PLoS ONE 7(11): e48145. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0048145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural history ==
Laotian rock rats are found in regions of [[Karst topography|karst]] [[limestone]].  They appear to be found only among limestone boulders on hillsides.  Villagers in the area are familiar with the animal, calling it ''kha-nyou'', and trapping it for food (Jenkins et al., 2005).  The animals are presumed to be [[nocturnal animal|nocturnal]].

These rock rats appear to be predominantly [[herbivore]]s, eating [[leaves]], [[grass]] and [[seed]]s.  They may eat [[insect]]s, as well, but probably not in high abundance.  Females may give birth to a single young (Jenkins ''et al.'', 2005).

Laotian rock rats appear to be quite docile and slow-moving over open ground.  They walk with feet splayed outward in a gait described as [[duck]]-like.  Although not ideal for mobility on open surfaces, this appears to be efficient when scrambling up and across large rocks, the sideways angle allowing for greater surface area for their feet to find purchase on angled surfaces.&lt;ref name="Florida State University"/&gt;

'''Louis I''' ({{circa| 1304}} &amp;ndash; 26 August 1346, ruled 1322&amp;ndash;1346) was [[Count of Flanders]], [[Count of Nevers|Nevers]] and [[Counts and dukes of Rethel|Rethel]].

==History==
He was the son of [[Louis I, Count of Nevers]], and [[Joan, Countess of Rethel]], and grandson of [[Robert III of Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;David M Nicholas, ''Medieval Flanders'', (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1992), 442.&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded his father as count of Nevers and his grandfather as count of Flanders in 1322. He inherited the county of Rethel from his mother.

In 1320 Louis married [[Margaret I, Countess of Artois|Margaret]], second daughter of King [[Philip V of France]] and [[Joan II, Countess of Burgundy]], who would later inherit her mother's counties of Burgundy and [[County of Artois|Artois]] in 1361.&lt;ref name="Tebrake47"&gt;William H. TeBrake, ''A Plague of Insurrection: Popular Politics and Peasant Revolt in Flanders, 1323-1328'', (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), 47.&lt;/ref&gt; This marriage alliance made him break with the anti-French policy of his grandfather Robert III and great-grandfather [[Guy, Count of Flanders|Guy I]].&lt;ref name="Tebrake47" /&gt;

His pro-French policies and excessive taxations levied by Louis caused an uprising in 1323. Beginning as a series of scattered rural riots, the [[Peasant revolt in Flanders 1323–1328|peasant insurrection]] escalated into a full-scale rebellion that dominated public affairs in Flanders for nearly five years until 1328. The rebels, led by [[Nicolaas Zannekin]], captured the towns of [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]], [[Veurne]], [[Ieper]] and [[Kortrijk]]. In Kortrijk, Zannekin was able to capture Louis himself. In 1325 the King of France, [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] intervened whereupon Louis was released from captivity in February 1326 and the ''Peace of Arques'' was sealed. The peace didn't last long and soon hostilities erupted again which made the count flee to France. Louis was able to convince his new liege [[Philip VI of France]] to come to his aid and Zannekin and his adherents were decisively defeated by the French royal army in the [[Battle of Cassel (1328)|Battle of Cassel]].

When the [[Hundred Years War]] started, Louis remained steadfast in his French policy, even with the county being economically dependent on England. His actions resulted in an English boycott of the wool trade which in turn sparked a new insurrection under [[Jacob van Artevelde]]. In 1339 the count had to flee his lands, never being able to return. Louis was killed at the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346.&lt;ref&gt;David Nicolle, ''Crécy 1346: Triumph of the Longbow'', (Osprey, 2000), 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He and Margaret had one son:

'''Sarah Margaret Fuller Ossoli''' (May 23, 1810 – July 19, 1850), commonly known as '''Margaret Fuller''', was an American journalist, critic, and [[women's rights]] advocate associated with the American [[transcendentalism]] movement. She was the first full-time American female book reviewer in journalism. Her book ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' is considered the first major [[feminism|feminist]] work in the United States.

Born Sarah Margaret Fuller in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], she was given a substantial early education by her father, [[Timothy Fuller]]. She later had more formal schooling and became a teacher before, in 1839, she began overseeing what she called "conversations": discussions among women meant to compensate for their lack of access to higher education. She became the first editor of the transcendentalist journal ''[[The Dial]]'' in 1840, before joining the staff of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' under [[Horace Greeley]] in 1844. By the time she was in her 30s, Fuller had earned a reputation as the [[wikt:well-read|best-read]] person in [[New England]], male or female, and became the first woman allowed to use the library at [[Harvard College]]. Her seminal work, ''Woman in the Nineteenth Century'', was published in 1845. A year later, she was sent to Europe for the ''Tribune'' as its first female [[correspondent]]. She soon became involved with the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|revolutions in Italy]] and allied herself with [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]. She had a relationship with Giovanni Ossoli, with whom she had a child. All three members of the family died in a shipwreck off [[Fire Island, New York]], as they were traveling to the United States in 1850. Fuller's body was never recovered.

Fuller was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. She also encouraged many other reforms in society, including [[prison reform]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|emancipation of slaves]] in the United States. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], cite Fuller as a source of inspiration. Many of her contemporaries, however, were not supportive, including her former friend [[Harriet Martineau]].  She said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist. Shortly after Fuller's death, her importance faded; the editors who prepared her letters to be published, believing her fame would be short-lived, censored or altered much of her work before publication.

===Early life and family===
[[File:MargaretFullerHouseJuly2008.jpg|thumb|right|Birthplace and childhood home of Margaret Fuller]]
Sarah Margaret Fuller was born on May 23, 1810,&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 42. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cambridgeport]], [[Massachusetts]], the first child of Congressman [[Timothy Fuller]] and Margaret Crane Fuller. She was named after her paternal grandmother and her mother, but by age nine she dropped "Sarah" and insisted on being called "Margaret."&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 10&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Margaret Fuller House]], in which she was born, is still standing. Her father taught her to read and write at the age of three and a half, shortly after the couple's second daughter, Julia Adelaide, died at 14 months old.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; He offered her an education as rigorous as any boy's at the time and forbade her to read the typical feminine fare of the time, such as [[etiquette]] books and sentimental novels.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, 264.&lt;/ref&gt; He incorporated [[Latin]] into his teaching shortly after the birth of the couple's son Eugene in May 1815, and soon Margaret was translating simple passages from [[Virgil]].&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life Margaret blamed her father's exacting love and his valuation of accuracy and precision for her childhood nightmares and sleepwalking.&lt;ref name=Baker130&gt;Baker, Anne. "Margaret Fuller" in ''Writers of the American Renaissance: An A to Z Guide''. Denise D. Knight, editor. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2003: 130. {{ISBN|0-313-32140-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the day Margaret spent time with her mother, who taught her household chores and [[sewing]].&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1817, her brother William Henry Fuller was born, and her father was elected as a representative in the [[United States Congress]]. For the next eight years, he spent four to six months a year in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; At age ten, Fuller wrote a cryptic note which her father saved: "On 23 May 1810, was born one foredoomed to sorrow and pain, and like others to have misfortunes."&lt;ref&gt;Deiss, 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller began her formal education at the Port School in Cambridgeport in 1819&lt;ref name=Baker130/&gt; before attending the [[Boston Lyceum for Young Ladies]] from 1821 to 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, John. "Fuller, Margaret" in ''Biographical Dictionary of Literary Influences: The Nineteenth Century, 1800-1914''. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2001: 164. {{ISBN|0-313-30422-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824, she was sent to the School for Young Ladies in [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], on the advice of aunts and uncles, though she resisted the idea at first.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; While she was there, Timothy Fuller did not run for re-election, in order to help [[John Quincy Adams]] with his presidential campaign in 1824; he hoped Adams would return the favor with a governmental appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 17, 1825, Fuller attended the ceremony at which the [[American Revolutionary War]] hero [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] laid the cornerstone of the [[Bunker Hill Monument]] 50 years after the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller left the Groton school after two years and returned home at 16.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; At home she studied the [[classics]] and trained herself in several [[modern language]]s and read world literature.&lt;ref name=Kane156&gt;Kane, Paul. ''Poetry of the American Renaissance''. New York: George Braziller, 1995: 156. {{ISBN|0-8076-1398-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, she realized she did not fit in with other young women her age. She wrote, "I have felt that I was not born to the common womanly lot."&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eliza Farrar]], wife of Harvard professor [[John Farrar (scientist)|John Farrar]] and author of ''The Young Lady's Friend'' (1836), attempted to train her in feminine etiquette until the age of 20,&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; but was never wholly successful.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Fuller was an avid reader. By the time she was in her 30s, she had earned a reputation as the best-read person, male or female, in [[New England]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, 263&lt;/ref&gt; She used her knowledge to give private lessons based on the teaching style of [[Elizabeth Peabody|Elizabeth Palmer Peabody]].&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 82&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller hoped to earn her living through journalism and translation; her first published work, a response to historian [[George Bancroft]], appeared in November 1834 in the ''[[North American Review]]''.&lt;ref name=Dickenson91&gt;Dickenson, 91&lt;/ref&gt; When she was 23, her father's law practice failed and he moved the family to a farm in Groton.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; On February 20, 1835, [[Frederic Henry Hedge]] and [[James Freeman Clarke]] asked her to contribute to each of their periodicals. Clarke helped her publish her first literary review in the ''Western Messenger'' in June: criticisms of recent biographies on [[George Crabbe]] and [[Hannah More]].&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 64–66&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of that year, she suffered a terrible [[migraine]] with a fever that lasted nine days. Fuller continued to experience such headaches throughout her life.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 92&lt;/ref&gt; While she was still recovering, her father died of [[cholera]] on October 2, 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 71&lt;/ref&gt; She was deeply affected by his death: "My father's image follows me constantly", she wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 93&lt;/ref&gt; She vowed to step in as the head of the family and take care of her widowed mother and younger siblings.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 72&lt;/ref&gt; Her father had not left a will, and two of her uncles gained control of his property and finances, later assessed at $18,098.15, and the family had to rely on them for support. Humiliated by the way her uncles were treating the family, Fuller wrote that she regretted being "of the softer sex, and never more than now".&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Greene Street School.png|right|thumb|The Greene Street School where Fuller taught from 1837 to 1839]]
Around this time, Fuller was hoping to prepare a biography of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], but felt that she could work on it only if she traveled to Europe. Her father's death and her sudden responsibility for her family caused her to abandon this idea.&lt;ref name=Dickenson91/&gt; In 1836, Fuller was given a job teaching at [[Amos Bronson Alcott|Bronson Alcott's]] Temple School in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; where she remained for a year. She then accepted an invitation to teach under [[Hiram Fuller (journalist)|Hiram Fuller]] (no relation) at the Greene Street School in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], in April 1837 with the unusually high salary of $1,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Her family sold the Groton farm and Fuller moved with them to [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 32&lt;/ref&gt; On November 6, 1839, Fuller held the first of her "conversations",&lt;ref name=Slater43&gt;Slater, 43&lt;/ref&gt; discussions among local women who met in the Boston home of the Peabodys.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brenda Wineapple|Wineapple, Brenda]]. "Nathaniel Hawthorne 1804–1864: A Brief Biography", ''A Historical Guide to Nathaniel Hawthorne'', Larry J. Reynolds, ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001: 25. {{ISBN|0-19-512414-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller intended to compensate for the lack of women's education&lt;ref&gt;Cheever, 32&lt;/ref&gt; with discussions and debates focused on subjects including the fine arts, history, mythology, literature, and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 134&lt;/ref&gt; Serving as the "nucleus of conversation", Fuller also intended to answer the "great questions" facing women: "What were we born to do? How shall we do it? which so few ever propose to themselves 'till their best years are gone by".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Megan. ''The Peabody Sisters: Three Women Who Ignited American Romanticism''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2005: 387. {{ISBN|978-0-618-71169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of significant figures in the women's rights movement attended these gatherings, including [[Sophia Ripley|Sophia Dana Ripley]], Caroline Sturgis,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Megan. ''The Peabody Sisters: Three Women Who Ignited American Romanticism''. Boston: Mariner Books, 2005: 386–387. {{ISBN|978-0-618-71169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maria White Lowell]].&lt;ref name=Slater43/&gt;

===''The Dial''===
In October 1839, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] was seeking an editor for his [[transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] journal ''[[The Dial]]''. After several declined the position, he offered it to Fuller, referring to her as "my vivacious friend."&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 128&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson had met Fuller in Cambridge in 1835; of that meeting, he admitted: "she made me laugh more than I liked." The next summer, Fuller spent two weeks at [[Ralph Waldo Emerson House|Emerson's home]] in Concord.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller accepted Emerson's offer to edit ''The Dial'' on October 20, 1839, and began work in the first week of 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 120&lt;/ref&gt; She edited the journal from 1840 to 1842, though her promised annual salary of $200 was never paid.&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her role, she was soon recognized as one of the most important figures of the transcendental movement and was invited to [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley's]] [[Brook Farm]], a communal experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller never officially joined the community but was a frequent visitor, often spending New Year's Eve there.&lt;ref name=Blanchard187&gt;Blanchard, 187&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1843, she traveled to Chicago, [[Milwaukee]], [[Niagara Falls]], and [[Buffalo, New York]];&lt;ref name=Blanchard196&gt;Blanchard, 196&lt;/ref&gt; while there, she interacted with several Native Americans, including members of the [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]] and the [[Ojibwa|Chippewa]] tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 80&lt;/ref&gt; She reported her experiences in a book called ''[[Summer on the Lakes]]'',&lt;ref name=Blanchard196/&gt; which she completed writing on her 34th birthday in 1844.&lt;ref name=Slater82&gt;Slater, 82&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Evert Augustus Duyckinck]] called it "the only genuine book, I can think of, this season."&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 217&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller used the library at [[Harvard College]] to do research on the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]],&lt;ref name=Blanchard196/&gt; and became the first woman allowed to use Harvard's library.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller's "[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century|The Great Lawsuit]]" was written in serial form for ''The Dial''. She originally intended to name the work ''The Great Lawsuit: Man 'versus' Men, Woman 'versus' Women'';&lt;ref name=VonMehren192&gt;Von Mehren, 192&lt;/ref&gt; when it was expanded and published independently in 1845, it was entitled ''Woman in the Nineteenth Century''. After completing it, she wrote to a friend: "I had put a good deal of my true self in it, as if, I suppose I went away now, the measure of my footprint would be left on earth."&lt;ref name=Slater89&gt;Slater, 89&lt;/ref&gt; The work discussed the role that women played in American democracy and Fuller's opinion on possibilities for improvement. It has since become one of the major documents in American [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 166&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered the first of its kind in the United States.&lt;ref name=Slater89/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gura172&gt;Gura, 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===''New York Tribune''===
[[File:Margaret Fuller by Chappel.jpg|right|thumb|Engraving of Margaret Fuller]]
Fuller left ''The Dial'' in 1844 in part because of ill health but also because of her disappointment with the publication's dwindling subscription list.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 225&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to New York that autumn and joined [[Horace Greeley|Horace Greeley's]] ''[[New York Tribune]]'' as a literary critic, becoming the first full-time book reviewer in American journalism&lt;ref&gt;Callow, Philip. ''From Noon to Starry Night: A Life of Walt Whitman''. Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, 1992: 110. {{ISBN|0-929587-95-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, by 1846, the publication's first female editor.&lt;ref&gt;Cheever, 175&lt;/ref&gt; Her first article, a review of a collection of essays by Emerson, appeared in the December 1, 1844, issue.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 97&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the ''Tribune'' had some 50,000 subscribers and Fuller earned $500 a year for her work.&lt;ref name=Gura226&gt;Gura, 226&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to American books, she reviewed foreign literature, concerts, lectures, and art exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 215&lt;/ref&gt; During her four years with the publication, she published more than 250&amp;nbsp;columns, most signed with a "*" as a byline.&lt;ref name=Gura226/&gt; In these columns, Fuller discussed topics ranging from art and literature to political and social issues such as the plight of slaves and women's rights.&lt;ref name=Gura227&gt;Gura, 227&lt;/ref&gt; She also published poetry; her poems, styled after the work of Emerson, do not have the same intellectual vigor as her criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Emily Stipes. ''The Poetry of American Women from 1632 to 1945''. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 1978: 182. {{ISBN|0-292-76450-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, she was also involved in a scandal involving fellow literary critic [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who had been carrying on a public flirtation with the married poet [[Frances Sargent Osgood]].&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 280. {{ISBN|0-06-092331-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another poet, [[Elizabeth F. Ellet]], had become enamored of Poe and jealous of Osgood&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey. ''Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy''. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1992: 190. {{ISBN|0-8154-1038-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested the relationship between Poe and Osgood was more than an innocent flirtation.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey. ''Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy''. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1992: 191. {{ISBN|0-8154-1038-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osgood then sent Fuller and [[Anne Lynch Botta]] to [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage|Poe's cottage]] on her behalf to request that he return the personal letters she had sent him. Angered by their interference, Poe called them "Busy-bodies".&lt;ref name=VonMehren225&gt;Von Mehren, 225&lt;/ref&gt; A public scandal erupted and continued until Osgood's estranged husband [[Samuel Stillman Osgood]] stepped in and threatened to sue Ellet.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Sidney P. ''Poe's Literary Battles: The Critic in the Context of His Literary Milieu''. Southern Illinois University Press, 1969: 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assignment in Europe===
[[File:Largo Margaret Fuller Ossoli (Rieti) 01.JPG|thumb|left|The house in [[Rieti]], Italy where Margaret Fuller lived and gave birth to her son (the one on the left side of the arch, not where the plaque has been placed).]]

In 1846 the ''New York Tribune'' sent Fuller to Europe, specifically England and Italy, as its first female foreign correspondent.&lt;ref&gt;Cheever, 176&lt;/ref&gt; She traveled from Boston to [[Liverpool]] in August on the ''Cambria'', a vessel that used both sail and steam to make the journey in ten days and sixteen hours.&lt;ref&gt;Deiss, 18&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next four years she provided the ''Tribune'' with thirty-seven reports.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 234&lt;/ref&gt; She interviewed many prominent writers including [[George Sand]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]]&amp;mdash;whom she found disappointing because of his [[reactionary]] politics, among other things. George Sand had previously been an idol of hers, but Fuller was disappointed when Sand chose not to run for the French National Assembly, saying that women were not ready to vote or to hold political office.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 296&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller was also given a letter of introduction to [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth Barrett]] by [[Cornelius Mathews]], but did not meet her at that time, because Barrett had just eloped with [[Robert Browning]].&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 235&lt;/ref&gt;

In England in the spring of 1846, she met [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], who had been in exile there from Italy since 1837.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 235&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller also met the Italian revolutionary Giovanni Angelo Ossoli, a marquis who had been disinherited by his family because of his support for Mazzini.&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, 188&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller and Ossoli moved in together in [[Florence|Florence, Italy]], likely before they were married, though whether they ever married is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Kane156/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheever, 176–177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 204&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller was originally opposed to marrying him, in part because of the difference in their religions; she was [[Protestant]] and he was [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;Deiss, 97&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson speculated that the couple was "married perhaps in Oct. Nov. or Dec" of 1847, though he did not explain his reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 341&lt;/ref&gt; Biographers have speculated that the couple married on April 4, 1848, to celebrate the anniversary of their first meeting&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 300&lt;/ref&gt; but one biographer provided evidence they first met on April 1 during the ceremony called "Lavanda degli Altari" (Altars Lavage).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vi scrivo da una Roma barricata (I write to you from a barricaded Rome), p. 52|last=Bannoni|first=Mario|last2=Mariotti|first2=Gabriella|publisher=Conosci per scegliere|year=2012|isbn=978-88-903772-7-3|location=Rome|pages=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the couple moved to Florence, they were referred to as husband and wife, though it is unclear if any formal ceremony took place.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 328&lt;/ref&gt; It seems certain that at the time their child was born, they were not married. By New Year's Day 1848, she suspected that she was pregnant but kept it from Ossoli for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 276–277&lt;/ref&gt; Their child, Angelo Eugene Philip Ossoli, was born in early September 1848&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 237&lt;/ref&gt; and nicknamed Angelino. The couple was very secretive about their relationship but, after Angelino suffered an unnamed illness, they became less so.&lt;ref name=Deiss281&gt;Deiss, 281&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller informed her mother about Ossoli and Angelino in August 1849 in a letter that explained that she had kept silent so as not to upset her "but it has become necessary, on account of the child, for us to live publicly and permanently together."&lt;ref name=Deiss281/&gt; Her mother's response makes it clear that she was aware that the couple was not legally married.&lt;ref&gt;Deiss, 282&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, she was happy for her daughter, writing: "I send my first kiss with my fervent blessing to my grandson."&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 317&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Largo Margaret Fuller Ossoli (Rieti) lapide commemorativa.JPG|thumb|Plaque placed in 2010 on the house in Rieti]]

The couple supported Giuseppe Mazzini's revolution for the establishment of a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] in 1849. Ossoli fought in the struggle while Fuller volunteered at a supporting hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 301–302&lt;/ref&gt; When the republicans they supported met defeat,&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 268–270; Deiss, 186; Dickenson, 186&lt;/ref&gt; they had to flee Italy and decided to move to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Deiss, 302&lt;/ref&gt; En route, they returned to Paris, where she finally met Elizabeth Barrett Browning.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, Margaret. ''Elizabeth Barrett Browning''. New York: Doubleday, 1989: 239. {{ISBN|0-385-24959-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller intended to use her experience in Italy to write a book about the history of the Roman Republic—a work she may have begun as early as 1847—&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 252&lt;/ref&gt; and hoped to find an American publisher after a British one rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;Deiss, 303&lt;/ref&gt; She believed the work would be her most important, referring to it in a March 1849 letter to her brother Richard as, "something good which may survive my troubled existence."&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, 194&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
In the beginning of 1850, Fuller wrote to a friend: "It has long seemed that in the year 1850 I should stand on some important plateau in the ascent of life&amp;nbsp;... I feel however no marked and important change as yet."&lt;ref&gt;Deiss, 300&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Fuller wrote: "I am absurdly fearful and various omens have combined to give me a dark feeling&amp;nbsp;... It seems to me that my future upon earth will soon close&amp;nbsp;... I have a vague expectation of some crisis—I know not what".&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after writing this, Fuller, Ossoli, and their child began a five-week return voyage to the United States aboard the ship ''Elizabeth'', an American merchant freighter carrying cargo that included mostly marble from [[Carrara]].&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 330–331&lt;/ref&gt; They set sail on May 17.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 331&lt;/ref&gt; At sea, the ship's captain, Seth Hasty, died of [[smallpox]].&lt;ref&gt;Deiss, 309–310&lt;/ref&gt; Angelino contracted the disease and recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 196&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly because of the inexperienced first mate, now serving as captain, the ship slammed into a [[shoal|sandbar]] less than 100 yards from [[Fire Island, New York]], on July 19, 1850, around {{Nowrap|3:30 a.m.}}&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, Philip. ''Hawthorne in Concord''. New York: Grove Press, 2004: 170–171. {{ISBN|0-8021-1776-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the other passengers and crew members abandoned ship. The first mate, Mr. Bangs, urged Fuller and Ossoli to try to save themselves and their child as he himself jumped overboard,&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 198&lt;/ref&gt; later claiming he believed Fuller had wanted to be left behind to die.&lt;ref name=Dickenson201&gt;Dickenson, 201&lt;/ref&gt; On the beach, people arrived with carts hoping to salvage any cargo washed ashore. None made any effort to rescue the crew or passengers of the ''Elizabeth'',&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 335–336&lt;/ref&gt; though they were only 50 yards from shore.&lt;ref name=Dickenson201/&gt; Most of those aboard attempted to swim to shore, leaving Fuller and Ossoli and Angelino some of the last on the ship. Ossoli was thrown overboard by a massive wave and, after the wave had passed, a crewman who witnessed the event said Fuller could not be seen.&lt;ref&gt;Deiss, 313&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry David Thoreau]] traveled to New York, at the urging of Emerson, to search the shore but neither Fuller's body nor that of her husband was ever recovered. Angelino's had washed ashore.&lt;ref&gt;Arvin, Newton. ''Longfellow: His Life and Work''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1963: 171&lt;/ref&gt; Few of their possessions were found other than some of the child's clothes and a few letters.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 338&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller's manuscript on the history of the Roman Republic was also [[Lost works|lost]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 429&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial to Fuller was erected on the beach at Fire Island in 1901 through the efforts of [[Julia Ward Howe]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth.

Within a week after her death, Horace Greeley suggested to Emerson that a biography of Fuller, to be called ''Margaret and Her Friends'', be prepared quickly "before the interest excited by her sad decease has passed away".&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 340&lt;/ref&gt; Many of her writings were soon collected together by her brother [[Arthur Buckminster Fuller|Arthur]] as ''At Home and Abroad'' (1856) and ''Life Without and Life Within'' (1858). He also edited a new version of ''Woman in the Nineteenth Century'' in 1855.&lt;ref name=VonMehren344&gt;Von Mehren, 344&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1852, ''The Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli'' was published,&lt;ref name=VonMehren343&gt;Von Mehren, 343&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Emerson, [[James Freeman Clarke]], and [[William Henry Channing]], though much of the work was censored or reworded. It left out details about her love affair with Ossoli and an earlier relationship with a man named James Nathan.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 339&lt;/ref&gt; The three editors, believing the public interest in Fuller would be short-lived and that she would not survive as a historical figure, were not concerned about accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 342&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, it was the best-selling biography of the decade and went through thirteen editions before the end of the century.&lt;ref name=VonMehren343/&gt; The book focused on her personality rather than her work. Detractors of the book ignored her status as a critic and instead criticized her personal life and her "unwomanly" arrogance.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 340&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller was an early proponent of feminism and especially believed in providing education to women.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 245&lt;/ref&gt; Once equal educational rights were afforded women, she believed, women could push for equal political rights as well.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 132&lt;/ref&gt; She advocated that women seek any employment they wish, rather than catering to the stereotypical "feminine" roles of the time, such as teaching. She once said, "If you ask me what office women should fill, I reply—any&amp;nbsp;... let them be sea captains if you will. I do not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office".&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 4&lt;/ref&gt; She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 174&lt;/ref&gt; and disliked the popular female poets of her time.&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, 172&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller also warned women to be careful about marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands. As she wrote, "I wish woman to live, ''first'' for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty".&lt;ref name=VonMehren192/&gt; By 1832, she had made a personal commitment to stay single.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 135&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female: "There is no wholly masculine man&amp;nbsp;... no purely feminine" but that both were present in any individual.&lt;ref name=Gura227/&gt; She suggested also that within a female were two parts: the intellectual side (which she called the [[Minerva]]) and the "lyrical" or "Femality" side (the [[Muse]]).&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 168&lt;/ref&gt; She admired the work of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], who believed men and women shared "an angelic ministry", as she wrote, as well as [[Charles Fourier]], who placed "Woman on an entire equality with Man".&lt;ref name=Gura172/&gt; Unlike several contemporary women writers, including "[[Lydia Sigourney|Mrs. Sigourney]]" and "[[Harriet Beecher Stowe|Mrs. Stowe]]", she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as "Margaret".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, 261&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller also advocated reform at all levels of society, including prison. In October 1844, she visited [[Sing Sing]] and interviewed the women prisoners, even staying overnight in the facility.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 229&lt;/ref&gt; Sing Sing was developing a more humane system for its women inmates, many of whom were prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 211&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller was also concerned about the homeless and those living in dire poverty, especially in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 230&lt;/ref&gt; She also admitted that, though she was raised to believe "that the Indian obstinately refused to be civilized", her travels in the American West made her realize that the white man unfairly treated the Native Americans; she considered Native Americans an important part of American heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; She also supported the rights of African-Americans, referring to "this cancer of slavery",&lt;ref&gt;Deiss, 93&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that those who were interested in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] movement follow the same reasoning when considering the rights of women: "As the friend of the Negro assumes that one man cannot by right hold another in bondage, so should the Friend of Woman assume that Man cannot by right lay even well-meant restrictions on Woman."&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 91&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested that those who spoke against the emancipation of slaves were similar to those who did not support the emancipation of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Deiss, 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller agreed with the transcendental concern for the psychological well-being of the individual,&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 231&lt;/ref&gt; though she was never comfortable being labeled a transcendentalist.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 84&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, she wrote, if being labeled a transcendentalist means "that I have an active mind frequently busy with large topics I hope it is so".&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Anne C. ''Transcendentalism as a Social Movement, 1830–1850''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press: 1981: 181. {{ISBN|0-300-02587-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She criticized people such as Emerson, however, for focusing too much on individual improvement and not enough on social reform.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; Like other members of the so-called [[Transcendental Club]], she rebelled against the past and believed in the possibility of change. However, unlike others in the movement, her rebellion was not based on religion.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 125–126&lt;/ref&gt; Though Fuller occasionally attended [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] congregations, she did not entirely identify with that religion. As biographer [[Charles Capper]] has noted, she "was happy to remain on the Unitarian margins."&lt;ref&gt;Capper, Charles. ''Margaret Fuller: An American Romantic Life. Vol. II: The Public Years''. Oxford University Press, 2007: 214. {{ISBN|978-0-19-539632-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and criticism==
[[File:WomanInTheNineteenthCentury1845.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of ''Woman in the Nineteenth Century'' (1845)]]
Margaret Fuller was especially known in her time for her personality and, in particular, for being overly self-confident and having a bad temper.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 137&lt;/ref&gt; This personality was the inspiration for the character Hester Prynne in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne|Nathaniel Hawthorne's]] novel ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', specifically her radical thinking about "the whole race of womanhood".&lt;ref&gt;Wineapple, Brenda. "Nathaniel Hawthorne 1804–1864: A Brief Biography", ''A Historical Guide to Nathaniel Hawthorne'', Larry J. Reynolds, ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001: 25–26. {{ISBN|0-19-512414-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She may also be the basis for the character Zenobia in another of Hawthorne's works, ''[[The Blithedale Romance]]''.&lt;ref name=Blanchard187/&gt; Hawthorne and his then-fiancée [[Sophia Hawthorne|Sophia]] had first met Fuller in October 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Megan. ''The Peabody Sisters: Three Women Who Ignited American Romanticism''. Boston: Mariner Books, 2005: 384. {{ISBN|978-0-618-71169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also an inspiration to poet [[Walt Whitman]], who believed in her call for the forging of a new national identity and a truly American literature.&lt;ref&gt;Callow, Philip. ''From Noon to Starry Night: A Life of Walt Whitman''. Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, 1992: 111. {{ISBN|0-929587-95-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] was also a strong admirer, but believed that Fuller's unconventional views were unappreciated in the United States and, therefore, she was better off dead.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, 259&lt;/ref&gt; She also said that Fuller's history of the Roman Republic would have been her greatest work: "The work she was preparing upon Italy would probably have been more equal to her faculty than anything previously produced by her pen (her other writings being curiously inferior to the impressions her conversation gave you)".&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, 44&lt;/ref&gt; An 1860 essay collection, ''Historical Pictures Retouched'', by [[Caroline Healey Dall]], called Fuller's ''Woman in the Nineteenth Century'' "doubtless the most brilliant, complete, and scholarly statement ever made on the subject".&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 284–285&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his personal issues with Fuller, the typically harsh literary critic [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote of the work as "a book which few women in the country could have written, and no woman in the country would have published, with the exception of Miss Fuller", noting its "independence" and "unmitigated radicalism".&lt;ref name=VonMehren225/&gt; Thoreau also thought highly of the book, suggesting that its strength came in part from Fuller's conversational ability. As he called it, it was "rich extempore writing, talking with pen in hand".&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Another admirer of Fuller was [[Susan B. Anthony]], a pioneer of women's rights, who wrote that Fuller "possessed more influence on the thought of American women than any woman previous to her time".&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller's work may have partially inspired the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, 113&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony, along with [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] wrote in their ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]'' that Fuller "was the precursor of the Women's Rights agitation".&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Elizabeth Cady; Anthony, Susan B.  and Gage, Matilda Joslyn. ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]'', Volume 1. New York: Fowler and Wells, 1881: 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars have suggested ''Woman in the Nineteenth Century'' was the first major women's rights work since [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Mary Wollstonecraft's]] ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792),&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; though an early comparison between the two women came from [[George Eliot]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if Fuller was familiar with Wollstonecraft's works; in her childhood, her father prevented her from reading them.&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, 133&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Fuller was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://greatwomen.org/women.php?action=viewone&amp;id=63 Margaret Fuller], National Women's Hall of Fame. Accessed July 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller, however, was not without her critics. A one-time friend, the English writer [[Harriet Martineau]] was one of her harshest detractors after Fuller's death. Martineau said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist, that she had "shallow conceits" and often "looked down upon persons who acted instead of talking finely&amp;nbsp;... and despised those who, like myself, could not adopt her scale of valuation".&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; The influential editor [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]], who believed she went against his notion of feminine modesty, referred to ''Woman in the Nineteenth Century'' as "an eloquent expression of her discontent at having been created female".&lt;ref&gt;Bayless, Joy. ''Rufus Wilmot Griswold: Poe's Literary Executor''. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1943: 121&lt;/ref&gt; New York writer [[Charles Frederick Briggs]] said that she was "wasting the time of her readers", especially because she was an unmarried woman and therefore could not "truly represent the female character".&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 196&lt;/ref&gt; English writer and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] scoffed at Fuller's conversations as well, saying, "My G–d,{{sic}} what rot did she and the other female dogs of Boston talk about Greek mythology!"&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, 47&lt;/ref&gt; Sophia Hawthorne, who had previously been a supporter of Fuller, was critical of her after ''Woman of the Nineteenth Century'' was published:&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Edwin Haviland. ''Salem Is My Dwelling Place: A Life of Nathaniel Hawthorne''. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1991: 235. {{ISBN|0-87745-332-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The impression it left was disagreeable. I did not like the tone of it—&amp; did not agree with her at all about the change in woman's outward circumstances&amp;nbsp;... Neither do I believe in such a character of man as she gives. It is altogether too ignoble&amp;nbsp;... I think Margaret speaks of many things that should not be spoken of.}}

Fuller had angered fellow poet and critic [[James Russell Lowell]] when she reviewed his work, calling him "absolutely wanting in the true spirit and tone of poesy&amp;nbsp;... his verse is [[stereotype (printing)|stereotyped]], his thought sounds no depth; and posterity will not remember him."&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''James Russell Lowell''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1966: 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Lowell took revenge in his [[satire|satirical]] ''[[A Fable for Critics]]'', first published in October 1848. At first, he considered excluding her entirely but ultimately gave her what was called the "most wholly negative characterization" in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, 294&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to her as Miranda, Lowell wrote that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own, she was genuine only in her spite and "when acting as censor, she privately blows a censer of vanity 'neath her own nose".&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''James Russell Lowell''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1966: 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Fuller's death, her importance faded. Her obituary in the newspaper she had once edited, the ''Daily Tribune'', said that her works had a few great sentiments, "but as a whole they must commend themselves mainly by their vigor of thought and habitual fearlessness rather than freedom of utterance".&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, 40&lt;/ref&gt; As biographer Abby Slater wrote, "Margaret had been demoted from a position of importance in her own right to one in which her only importance was in the company she kept".&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Hawthorne's son [[Julian Hawthorne|Julian]] wrote, "The majority of readers will, I think, not be inconsolable that poor Margaret Fuller has at last taken her place with the numberless other dismal frauds who fill the limbo of human pretension and failure."&lt;ref&gt;James, Laurie. ''Why Margaret Fuller Ossoli is Forgotten''. New York: Golden Heritage Press, 1988: 25. {{ISBN|0-944382-01-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, American writer [[Elizabeth Hardwick (writer)|Elizabeth Hardwick]], former wife of [[Robert Lowell]], wrote an essay called "The Genius of Margaret Fuller" (1986). She compared her own move from Boston to New York to Fuller's, saying that Boston was not a good place for intellectuals, despite the assumption that it was the best place for intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Susan. ''Literary Trail of Greater Boston''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000: 68–69. {{ISBN|0-618-05013-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Fuller was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/margaret-fuller/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Margaret Fuller]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 21, 2016, a historical marker in honor of Fuller was placed in [[Polhill Park]] in [[Beacon, New York|Beacon, NY]], to commemorate her staying at Van Vliet boarding house. For the dedication ceremony, Fuller's poem, "Truth and Form," was set to music by Debra Kaye and performed by singer, Kelly Ellenwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://highlandscurrent.com/2016/05/17/beacon-honor-early-feminist/|title=Beacon to Honor Early Feminist|last=Rooney|first=Alison|date=2016-05-17|work=The Highlands Current|access-date=2018-03-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA are thought to be of separate [[evolution]]ary origin, with the mtDNA being derived from the circular genomes of the [[bacteria]] that were engulfed by the early ancestors of today's eukaryotic cells. This theory is called the [[endosymbiotic theory]]. Each mitochondrion is estimated to contain 2–10 mtDNA copies.&lt;ref name=Wiesner&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0006-291X(92)90517-O |pmid=1550563 |title=Counting target molecules by exponential polymerase chain reaction: Copy number of mitochondrial DNA in rat tissues |journal=[[Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications]] |volume=183 |issue=2 |pages=553–9 |year=1992 |last1=Wiesner |first1=Rudolf J. |last2=Rüegg |first2=J.Caspar |last3=Morano |first3=Ingo }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the cells of extant organisms, the vast majority of the proteins present in the mitochondria (numbering approximately 1500 different types in [[mammal]]s) are coded for by [[nuclear DNA]], but the genes for some, if not most, of them are thought to have originally been of bacterial origin, having since been transferred to the [[eukaryotic]] nucleus during [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="Johnston, I.

== Mitochondrial inheritance ==
In most [[metazoans|multicellular organisms]], mtDNA is inherited from the mother (maternally inherited). Mechanisms for this include simple dilution (an egg contains on average 200,000 mtDNA molecules, whereas a healthy human [[sperm]] was reported to contain on average 5 molecules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolff |first1=J N |last2=Gemmell |first2=N J |title=Lost in the zygote: the dilution of paternal mtDNA upon fertilization |journal=Heredity |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=429–34 |year=2008 |pmid=18685570 |doi=10.1038/hdy.2008.74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10815-012-9785-z |pmid=22562241 |pmc=3430774 |title=Influence of microsurgical varicocelectomy on human sperm mitochondrial DNA copy number: A pilot study |journal=Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics |volume=29 |issue=8 |pages=759–64 |year=2012 |last1=Gabriel |first1=Maria San |last2=Chan |first2=Sam W. |last3=Alhathal |first3=Naif |last4=Chen |first4=Junjian Z. |last5=Zini |first5=Armand }}&lt;/ref&gt; ), degradation of sperm mtDNA in the male genital tract, in the fertilized egg, and, at least in a few organisms, failure of sperm mtDNA to enter the egg. Whatever the mechanism, this single parent ([[uniparental inheritance]]) pattern of mtDNA inheritance is found in most animals, most plants and in fungi as well.

=== Female inheritance ===
In [[sexual reproduction]], mitochondria are normally inherited exclusively from the mother; the mitochondria in mammalian sperm are usually destroyed by the egg cell after fertilization. Also, most mitochondria are present at the base of the sperm's tail, which is used for propelling the sperm cells; sometimes the tail is lost during fertilization. In 1999 it was reported that paternal sperm mitochondria (containing mtDNA) are marked with [[ubiquitin]] to select them for later destruction inside the [[embryo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/46466 |pmid=10586873 |year=1999 |last1=Schatten |first1=Gerald |title=Development: Ubiquitin tag for sperm mitochondria |journal=Nature |volume=402 |issue=6760 |pages=371–72 |last2=Sutovsky |first2=Peter |last3=Moreno |first3=Ricardo D. |last4=Ramalho-Santos |first4=João |last5=Dominko |first5=Tanja |last6=Simerly |first6=Calvin |bibcode=1999Natur.402..371S }} Discussed in: {{cite journal |doi=10.2307/4012086 |jstor=4012086 |title=Mom's Eggs Execute Dad's Mitochondria |journal=Science News |volume=157 |page=5 |year=2000 |last1=Travis |first1=John |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moms-eggs-execute-dads-mitochondria |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219174548/http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20000101/fob3.asp |archivedate=19 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''[[in vitro]]'' fertilization techniques, particularly injecting a sperm into an [[oocyte]], may interfere with this.

The fact that mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited enables [[Genetic genealogy|genealogical]] researchers to trace [[Matrilineality|maternal lineage]] far back in time. ([[Y chromosome|Y-chromosomal DNA]], paternally inherited, is used in an analogous way to determine the [[patrilineal]] history.) This is usually accomplished on [[human mitochondrial DNA]] by sequencing the [[hypervariable control region]]s (HVR1 or HVR2), and sometimes the complete molecule of the mitochondrial DNA, as a [[genealogical DNA test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/wiki/en/Hiring_a_DNA_Testing_Company|title=Hiring a DNA Testing Company Genealogy|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Family Search|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; HVR1, for example, consists of about 440 base pairs. These 440 base pairs are then compared to the control regions of other individuals (either specific people or subjects in a database) to determine maternal lineage. Most often, the comparison is made to the revised [[Cambridge Reference Sequence]]. Vilà ''et al.'' have published studies tracing the matrilineal descent of domestic dogs to wolves.&lt;ref name="Vila"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.276.5319.1687 |pmid=9180076 |title=Multiple and Ancient Origins of the Domestic Dog |journal=Science |volume=276 |issue=5319 |pages=1687–89 |year=1997 |last1=Vila |first1=C. |last2=Savolainen |first2=P |last3=Maldonado |first3=J.

The concept of the [[Mitochondrial Eve]] is based on the same type of analysis, attempting to discover the origin of [[human]]ity by tracking the lineage back in time.

mtDNA is highly conserved, and its relatively slow mutation rates (compared to other DNA regions such as [[microsatellite]]s) make it useful for studying the evolutionary relationships—[[phylogeny]]—of organisms. Biologists can determine and then compare mtDNA sequences among different species and use the comparisons to build an [[evolutionary tree]] for the species examined. However, due to the slow mutation rates it experiences, it is often hard to distinguish between closely related species to any large degree, so other methods of analysis must be used.

=== The mitochondrial bottleneck ===
Entities undergoing uniparental inheritance and with little to no recombination may be expected to be subject to [[Muller's ratchet]], the accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality is lost. Animal populations of mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process known as the [[Heteroplasmy#Mitochondrial bottleneck|mtDNA bottleneck]]. The bottleneck exploits [[cellular noise|stochastic processes in the cell]] to increase in the cell-to-cell variability in [[heteroplasmy|mutant load]] as an organism develops: a single egg cell with some proportion of mutant mtDNA thus produces an embryo where different cells have different mutant loads. Cell-level selection may then act to remove those cells with more mutant mtDNA, leading to a stabilisation or reduction in mutant load between generations. The mechanism underlying the bottleneck is debated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gilbert |first1=M.

=== Mitochondrial donation ===
{{Main|Mitochondrial donation}}
An IVF technique known as mitochondrial donation or mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT) results in offspring containing mtDNA from a donor female, and nuclear DNA from the mother and father. In the spindle transfer procedure, the nucleus of an egg is inserted into the cytoplasm of an egg from a donor female which has had its nucleus removed, but still contains the donor female's mtDNA. The composite egg is then fertilized with the male's sperm. The procedure is used when a woman with [[Mitochondrial disease|genetically defective mitochondria]] wishes to procreate and produce offspring with healthy mitochondria.&lt;ref name="Frith"&gt;{{cite news |last=Frith |first=Maxine |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/ban-on-scientists-trying-to-create-threeparent-baby-583284.html |title=Ban on scientists trying to create three-parent baby |newspaper=The Independent |date=14 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known child to be born as a result of mitochondrial donation was a boy born to a Jordanian couple in Mexico on 6 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37485263|title=First 'three person baby' born using new method|last=Roberts|first=Michelle|date=2016-09-27|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
=== Circular versus linear ===
In most multicellular organisms, the mtDNA – or mitogenome – is organized as a circular, [[covalent bond|covalently]] closed, double-stranded [[DNA]]. But in many unicellular (e.g. the [[ciliate]] ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' or the [[green alga]] ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'') and in rare cases also in multicellular organisms (e.g. in some species of [[Cnidaria]]) the mtDNA is found as linearly organized [[DNA]]. Most of these linear mtDNAs possess [[telomerase]]-independent [[telomere]]s (i.e. the ends of the linear [[DNA]]) with different modes of replication, which have made them interesting objects of research, as many of these unicellular organisms with linear mtDNA are known [[pathogen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(98)01443-7 |pmid=9613202 |title=Linear mitochondrial genomes: 30 years down the line |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=184–88 |year=1998 |last1=Nosek |first1=Jozef |last2=Tomáška |first2=L'Ubomı́r |last3=Fukuhara |first3=Hiroshi |last4=Suyama |first4=Yoshitaka |last5=Kováč |first5=Ladislav }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In mammals ===
For [[human mitochondrial DNA]] (and probably for that of [[metazoans]] in general), 100–10,000 separate copies of mtDNA are usually present per [[somatic cell]] (egg and [[Spermatozoon|sperm cells]] are exceptions). In mammals, each double-stranded circular mtDNA [[molecule]] consists of 15,000–17,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000285 |pmid=20087410 |pmc=2799514 |title=A Predominantly Neolithic Origin for European Paternal Lineages |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=e1000285 |year=2010 |last1=Balaresque |first1=Patricia |last2=Bowden |first2=Georgina R. |last3=Adams |first3=Susan M. |last4=Leung |first4=Ho-Yee |last5=King |first5=Turi E. |last6=Rosser |first6=Zoë H. |last7=Goodwin |first7=Jane |last8=Moisan |first8=Jean-Paul |last9=Richard |first9=Christelle |last10=Millward |first10=Ann |last11=Demaine |first11=Andrew G. |last12=Barbujani |first12=Guido |last13=Previderè |first13=Carlo |last14=Wilson |first14=Ian J. |last15=Tyler-Smith |first15=Chris |last16=Jobling |first16=Mark A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[base pair]]s. The two strands of mtDNA are differentiated by their nucleotide content, with a [[guanine]]-rich strand referred to as the [[heavy strand]] (or H-strand) and a [[cytosine]]-rich strand referred to as the [[heavy strand|light strand]] (or L-strand).

=== In plants ===
Great variation in mtDNA gene content and size exists among fungi and plants, although there appears to be a core subset of genes that are present in all eukaryotes (except for the few that have no mitochondria at all).&lt;ref name="Johnston, I. G. and Williams, B. P. 2016"/&gt;
Some plant species have enormous mitochondrial genomes, with ''[[Silene conica]]'' mtDNA containing as many as 11,300,000 base pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sloan |first1=D.B. |last2=Alverson |first2=A.J. |last3=Chuckalovcak |first3=J.P. |last4=Wu |first4=M. |last5=McCauley |first5=D.E. |last6=Palmer |first6=J.D. |last7=Taylor |first7=D.R. |year=2012 |title=Rapid evolution of enormous, multichromosomal genomes in flowering plant mitochondria with exceptionally high mutation rates |journal=PLoS Biol |volume=10 |issue=1 |page=e1001241 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, even those huge mtDNAs contain the same number and kinds of genes as related plants with much smaller mtDNAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(81)90187-2 |pmid=6269758 |title=The mitochondrial genome is large and variable in a family of plants (Cucurbitaceae) |journal=Cell |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=793–803 |year=1981 |last1=Ward |first1=Bernard L. |last2=Anderson |first2=Robert S. |last3=Bendich |first3=Arnold J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The genome of the mitochondrion of the cucumber (''[[Cucumis sativus]]'') consists of three circular chromosomes (lengths 1556, 84 and 45 kilobases), which are entirely or largely autonomous with regard to their [[DNA replication|replication]].&lt;ref name=Alverson2011&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Andrew J |last1=Alverson |first2=Danny W |last2=Rice |first3=Stephanie |last3=Dickinson |first4=Kerrie |last4=Barry |first5=Jeffrey D |last5=Palmer |title=Origins and Recombination of the Bacterial-Sized Multichromosomal Mitochondrial Genome of Cucumber |journal=The Plant Cell |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=2499–513 |doi=10.1105/tpc.111.087189 |jstor=41433488 |pmid=21742987 |pmc=3226218 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In protists ===
The smallest mitochondrial genome sequenced to date is the 5,967 bp mtDNA of the parasite ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.idtdna.com/pages/docs/educational-resources/mitochondrial-dna.pdf?sfvrsn=4|title=Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)|publisher=Integrated DNA Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tyagi|first=Suchi|last2=Pande|first2=Veena|last3=Das|first3=Aparup|date=2014-02-19|title=Whole Mitochondrial Genome Sequence of an Indian ''Plasmodium falciparum'' Field Isolate|url=https://doi.org/10.3347/kjp.2014.52.1.99|journal=The Korean Journal of Parasitology|language=English|volume=52|issue=1|pages=99–103|doi=10.3347/kjp.2014.52.1.99|issn=0023-4001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genome diversity ==
There are six main genome types found in mitochondrial genomes, classified by their structure (e.g. circular versus linear), size, presence of [[intron]]s or [[Plasmid|plasmid like structures]], and whether the genetic material is a singular molecule or collection of [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]] or [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] molecules.&lt;ref name="Kolesnikov, A. A. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kolesnikov | first1 = A. A. | last2 = Gerasimov | first2 = E. S. | year = 2012 | title = Diversity of Mitochondrial Genome Organization | url = | journal = Biochemistry (Moscow) | volume = 77 | issue = 13| pages = 1424–35 | doi = 10.1134/S0006297912130020 | pmid = 23379519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animals ===
There is only one mitochondrial genome type found in animal cells. This genome usually contains one circular molecule with between 11–28 kbp of genetic material (type 1).&lt;ref name="Kolesnikov, A. A. 2012"/&gt;

=== Plants and fungi ===
There are three different genome types found in plants and fungi. The first type is a circular genome that has introns (type 2) and may range from 19 to 1000 kbp in length. The second genome type is a circular genome (about 20–1000 kbp) that also has a plasmid-like structure (1 kb) (type 3). The final genome type that can be found in plant and fungi is a linear genome made up of homogeneous DNA molecules (type 5).

=== Protists ===
Protists contain the most diverse mitochondrial genomes, with five different types found in this kingdom. Type 2, type 3 and type 5 mentioned in the plant and fungal genomes also exists in some protist, as well as two unique genome types. The first of these is a heterogeneous collection of circular DNA molecules (type 4) and the final genome type found in protists is a heterogeneous collection of linear molecules (type 6). Genome types 4 and 6 both range from 1–200 kbp in size.

Endosymbiotic gene transfer, the process of genes that were coded in the mitochondrial genome being transferred to the cell's main genome likely explains why more complex organisms, such as humans, have smaller mitochondrial genomes than simpler organisms, such as protists.

== Replication ==
Mitochondrial DNA is replicated by the [[DNA polymerase]] gamma complex which is composed of a 140 kDa catalytic DNA polymerase encoded by the ''[[POLG]]'' gene and two 55 kDa accessory subunits encoded by the ''[[POLG2]]'' gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.M509730200 |pmid=16263719 |title=Functional Human Mitochondrial DNA Polymerase   Forms a Heterotrimer |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=281 |issue=1 |pages=374–82 |year=2005 |last1=Yakubovskaya |first1=E. |last2=Chen |first2=Z. |last3=Carrodeguas |first3=J. A. |last4=Kisker |first4=C. |last5=Bogenhagen |first5=D. F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The replisome machinery is formed by DNA polymerase, [[PEO1|TWINKLE]] and mitochondrial [[SSB protein]]s. [[PEO1|TWINKLE]] is a [[helicase]], which unwinds short stretches of dsDNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction.&lt;ref name=Jemt2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/gkr653 |pmid=21840902 |pmc=3241658 |title=The mitochondrial DNA helicase TWINKLE can assemble on a closed circular template and support initiation of DNA synthesis |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=39 |issue=21 |pages=9238–49 |year=2011 |last1=Jemt |first1=E. |last2=Farge |first2=G. |last3=Backstrom |first3=S. |last4=Holmlund |first4=T. |last5=Gustafsson |first5=C. M. |last6=Falkenberg |first6=M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; All these polypeptides are encoded in the nuclear genome.

During [[embryogenesis]], replication of mtDNA is strictly down-regulated from the fertilized oocyte through the preimplantation embryo.&lt;ref name=John2010/&gt; The resulting reduction in per-cell copy number of mtDNA plays a role in the mitochondrial bottleneck, exploiting [[cellular noise|cell-to-cell variability]] to ameliorate the inheritance of damaging mutations.&lt;ref name=pmid26035426/&gt; At the [[blastocyst]] stage, the onset of mtDNA replication is specific to the cells of the [[trophectoderm]].&lt;ref name=John2010/&gt; In contrast, the cells of the [[inner cell mass]] restrict mtDNA replication until they receive the [[Cell signaling|signals]] to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to specific cell types.&lt;ref name=John2010&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmq002 |pmid=20231166 |title=Mitochondrial DNA transmission, replication and inheritance: A journey from the gamete through the embryo and into offspring and embryonic stem cells |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=488–509 |year=2010 |last1=St. John |first1=J.

== Transcription ==
In animal mitochondria, each DNA strand is transcribed continuously and produces a [[Messenger RNA#Monocistronic versus polycistronic mRNA|polycistronic]] RNA molecule. Between most (but not all) protein-coding regions, tRNAs are present (see the [[#Map of the human mitochondrial genome|human mitochondrial genome map]]). During transcription, the tRNAs acquire their characteristic L-shape that gets recognized and cleaved by specific enzymes. With the mitochondrial RNA processing, individual mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA sequences are released from the primary transcript.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falkenberg|first=Maria|last2=Larsson|first2=Nils-Göran|last3=Gustafsson|first3=Claes M.|date=2007-06-19|title=DNA Replication and Transcription in Mammalian Mitochondria|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.biochem.76.060305.152028|journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry|language=en|volume=76|issue=1|pages=679–99|doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.76.060305.152028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folded tRNAs therefore act as secondary structure punctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ojala|first=Deanna|last2=Montoya|first2=Julio|last3=Attardi|first3=Giuseppe|date=1981-04-09|title=tRNA punctuation model of RNA processing in human mitochondria|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v290/n5806/abs/290470a0.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=290|issue=5806|pages=470–74|doi=10.1038/290470a0|pmid=7219536|bibcode=1981Natur.290..470O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic illness ===
{{Further|Mitochondrial disease}}
Mutations of mitochondrial DNA can lead to a number of illnesses including [[exercise intolerance]] and [[Kearns–Sayre syndrome]] (KSS), which causes a person to lose full function of heart, eye, and muscle movements. Some evidence suggests that they might be major contributors to the aging process and [[Aging-associated diseases|age-associated pathologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/CS20040148 |pmid=15279618 |title=Mitochondrial DNA and aging |journal=Clinical Science |volume=107 |issue=4 |pages=355–64 |year=2004 |last1=Ledoux |first1=Susan P. |last2=Alexeyev |first2=Mikhail F. |last3=Wilson |first3=Glenn L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in the context of disease, the proportion of mutant mtDNA molecules in a cell is termed [[heteroplasmy]].

=== Use in disease diagnosis ===

Recently a mutation in mtDNA has been used to help diagnose prostate cancer in patients with negative [[prostate biopsy]].&lt;ref name="pmid20944788"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Brian |title=3.4 kb mitochondrial genome deletion serves as a surrogate predictive biomarker for prostate cancer in histopathologically benign biopsy cores |journal=Canadian Urological Association Journal |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=E118–22 |last1=Reguly |first2=John P. |last2=Jakupciak |first3=Ryan L. |last3=Parr |pmid=20944788 |pmc=2950771 |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20084081"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/pcan.2009.64 |pmid=20084081 |title=Accurate prediction of repeat prostate biopsy outcomes by a mitochondrial DNA deletion assay |journal=Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=126–31 |year=2010 |last1=Robinson |first1=K |last2=Creed |first2=J |last3=Reguly |first3=B |last4=Powell |first4=C |last5=Wittock |first5=R |last6=Klein |first6=D |last7=Maggrah |first7=A |last8=Klotz |first8=L |last9=Parr |first9=R L |last10=Dakubo |first10=G D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with aging ===
Though the idea is controversial, some evidence suggests a link between aging and mitochondrial genome dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Aubrey |last=de Grey |title=The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging |url=http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/MiFRA-06.pdf |isbn= 1-57059-564-X}}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, mutations in mtDNA upset a careful balance of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) production and enzymatic ROS scavenging (by enzymes like [[superoxide dismutase]], [[catalase]], [[glutathione peroxidase]] and others). However, some mutations that increase ROS production (e.g., by reducing antioxidant defenses) in worms increase, rather than decrease, their longevity.&lt;ref name=pmid19796285/&gt; Also, [[Naked mole-rat|naked mole rats]], [[rodent]]s about the size of [[Mouse|mice]], live about eight times longer than mice despite having reduced, compared to mice, antioxidant defenses and increased oxidative damage to biomolecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/ars.2012.4911 |pmid=23025341 |pmc=3791056 |title=The Naked Mole-Rat Response to Oxidative Stress: Just Deal with It |journal=Antioxidants &amp; Redox Signaling |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=1388–99 |year=2013 |last1=Lewis |first1=Kaitlyn N. |last2=Andziak |first2=Blazej |last3=Yang |first3=Ting |last4=Buffenstein |first4=Rochelle }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once, there was thought to be a positive feedback loop at work (a 'Vicious Cycle'); as mitochondrial DNA accumulates genetic damage caused by free radicals, the mitochondria lose function and leak free radicals into the [[cytosol]]. A decrease in mitochondrial function reduces overall metabolic efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.23.10771 |jstor=2365473 |pmid=7971961 |pmc=45108 |title=Oxidative damage and mitochondrial decay in aging |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=91 |issue=23 |pages=10771–78 |year=1994 |last1=Shigenaga |first1=M.

N. |bibcode=1994PNAS...9110771S }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this concept was conclusively disproved when it was demonstrated that mice, which were genetically altered to accumulate mtDNA mutations at accelerated rate do age prematurely, but their tissues do not produce more ROS as predicted by the 'Vicious Cycle' hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0508886102 |jstor=4152716 |pmid=16332961 |pmc=1312403 |title=Somatic mtDNA mutations cause aging phenotypes without affecting reactive oxygen species production |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=102 |issue=50 |pages=17993–98 |year=2005 |last1=Trifunovic |first1=A. |last2=Hansson |first2=A. |last3=Wredenberg |first3=A. |last4=Rovio |first4=A.

=== Neurodegenerative diseases ===

Increased mt[[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] is a feature of several [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative diseases]].

The brains of individuals with [[Alzheimer’s disease]] have elevated levels of [[DNA oxidation|oxidative DNA damage]] in both [[nuclear DNA]] and mtDNA, but the mtDNA has approximately 10-fold higher levels than nuclear DNA.&lt;ref name="pmid15857398"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang J, Xiong S, Xie C, Markesbery WR, Lovell MA |title=Increased oxidative damage in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in Alzheimer's disease |journal=J.

In [[Huntington’s disease]], mutant [[huntingtin protein]] causes mitochondria dysfunction involving inhibition of mitochondrial [[electron transport chain|electron transport]], higher levels of [[reactive oxygen species]] and increased [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref name="pmid28785371"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu Z, Zhou T, Ziegler AC, Dimitrion P, Zuo L |title=Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Diseases: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Applications |journal=Oxid Med Cell Longev |volume=2017 |issue= |pages=2525967 |date=2017 |pmid=28785371 |pmc=5529664 |doi=10.1155/2017/2525967 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutant huntingtin protein promotes oxidative damage to mtDNA, as well as nuclear DNA, that may contribute to Huntington’s disease [[pathology]].&lt;ref name="pmid23602907"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ayala-Peña S |title=Role of oxidative DNA damage in mitochondrial dysfunction and Huntington's disease pathogenesis |journal=Free Radic.

The [[DNA oxidation]] product [[8-oxoguanine]] (8-oxoG) is a well-established marker of oxidative DNA damage.  In persons with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), the enzymes that normally repair 8-oxoG DNA damages in the mtDNA of spinal [[motor neuron]]s are impaired.&lt;ref name="pmid11904761"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kikuchi H, Furuta A, Nishioka K, Suzuki SO, Nakabeppu Y, Iwaki T |title=Impairment of mitochondrial DNA repair enzymes against accumulation of 8-oxo-guanine in the spinal motor neurons of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis |journal=Acta Neuropathol. |volume=103 |issue=4 |pages=408–14 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11904761 |doi=10.1007/s00401-001-0480-x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus oxidative damage to mtDNA of motor neurons may be a significant factor in the [[etiology]] of ALS.

=== Correlation of the mtDNA base composition with animals lifespan ===
[[File:Correlation between the mtDNA GC% and maximum life span across 387 different mammalian species.png|thumb|Animal species mtDNA base composition was retrieved from the MitoAge database and compared to their maximum life span from AnAge database.]]
Over the past decade, an Israeli research group led by Professor Vadim Fraifeld has shown that extraordinarily strong and significant [[Correlation and dependence|correlations]] exist between the mtDNA base composition and animal species-specific maximum life spans.&lt;ref name="Lehmann et al., 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/rej.2006.9.223 |pmid=16706648 |title=Mitochondrial genome anatomy and species-specific lifespan |journal=Rejuvenation Res |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=223–26 |year=2006|last1=Lehmann |first1=Gilad |last2=Budovsky |first2=Arie |last3=Muradian |first3=K.

An additional astonishing observation is that the mtDNA GC% correlation with the maximum life spans is independent of the well-known correlation between animal species metabolic rate and maximum life spans. The mtDNA GC% and resting metabolic rate explain the differences in animal species maximum life spans in a multiplicative manner (i.e., species maximum life span = their mtDNA GC% * metabolic rate).&lt;ref name="Lehmann et al., 2008"/&gt; To support the scientific community in carrying out comparative analyses between mtDNA features and longevity across animals, a dedicated database was built named [http://www.mitoage.info/ MitoAge].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/gkv1187 |pmid=26590258 |title=MitoAge: a database for comparative analysis of mitochondrial DNA, with a special focus on animal longevity. |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=44 |issue=D1 |year=2016|last1=Toren |first1=Dmitri |last2=Barzilay |first2=Thomer |last3=Tacutu |first3=Robi |last4= Lehmann |first4=Gilad |last5= Muradian |first5=Khachik K. |last6= Fraifeld |first6=Vadim E. |pmc=4702847 |pages=D1262-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with non-B (non-canonical) DNA structures ===
Deletion breakpoints frequently occur within or near regions showing non-canonical (non-B) conformations, namely hairpins, cruciforms and cloverleaf-like elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Damas|first1=J|last2=Carneiro|first2=J|last3=Goncalves|first3=J|last4=Stewart|first4=JB|last5=Samwels|first5=DC|last6=Amorim|first6=A|last7=Pereira|first7=F|title=Mitochondrial DNA deletions are associated with non-B DNA conformations|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=2012|volume=40|issue=16|pages=7606–621|doi=10.1093/nar/gks500|pmid=22661583|pmc=3439893}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, there is data supporting the involvement of helix-distorting intrinsically curved regions and long G-tetrads in eliciting instability events.

== Use in identification ==
{{for|use in human identification|Human mitochondrial DNA}}
Unlike nuclear DNA, which is inherited from both parents and in which genes are rearranged in the process of [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], there is usually no change in mtDNA from parent to offspring. Although mtDNA also recombines, it does so with copies of itself within the same mitochondrion. Because of this and because the [[mutation rate]] of animal mtDNA is higher than that of nuclear DNA,&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.76.4.1967 |pmid=109836 |pmc=383514 |jstor=69636 |title=Rapid evolution of animal mitochondrial DNA |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=1967–71 |year=1979 |last1=Brown |first1=W. M. |last2=George |first2=M. |last3=Wilson |first3=A. C. |bibcode=1979PNAS...76.1967B }}&lt;/ref&gt; mtDNA is a powerful tool for tracking ancestry through females ([[matrilineage]]) and has been used in this role to track the ancestry of many species back hundreds of generations.

The rapid mutation rate (in animals) makes mtDNA useful for assessing genetic relationships of individuals or groups within a species and also for identifying and quantifying the phylogeny (evolutionary relationships; see [[phylogenetics]]) among different species. To do this, biologists determine and then compare the mtDNA sequences from different individuals or species. Data from the comparisons is used to construct a network of relationships among the sequences, which provides an estimate of the relationships among the individuals or species from which the mtDNAs were taken. mtDNA can be used to estimate the relationship between both closely related and distantly related species. Due to the high mutation rate of mtDNA in animals, the 3rd positions of the codons change relatively rapidly, and thus provide information about the genetic distances among closely related individuals or species. On the other hand, the substitution rate of mt-proteins is very low, thus amino acid changes accumulate slowly (with corresponding slow changes at 1st and 2nd codon positions) and thus they provide information about the genetic distances of distantly related species. Statistical models that treat substitution rates among codon positions separately, can thus be used to simultaneously estimate phylogenies that contain both closely and distantly related species&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;

'''Nicola Rubino''' ([[Alcamo]], 3 April 1905 – Rome, 25 February 1984) was an Italian sculptor and painter.

[[File:Bassorilievo a Porta Palermo (01), Alcamo.jpg|thumb|[[Cielo d'Alcamo]] at the court of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]]]

== Biography ==
[[File:Sculture_in_gesso_di_Nino_Rubino.jpg|thumb|Sculpture (plasters) by Nicola Rubino]]
He was the son of Francesco and Caterina Cudia and attended the [[Classical Lyceum]] in his town. In 1925, aged only 20, he moved to Rome to study at [[Accademia di Belle Arti]] together with different artists of [[Scuola romana]] like Mafai, Omiccioli, Fazzini&lt;ref name=euro&gt;A.A.V.V.: Nicola Rubino, Roma, tip.Eurosia&lt;/ref&gt; and Gentilizi; in Rome he had a close friendship with artists and intellectualis like Sarra, [[Renato Guttuso|Guttuso]] and [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]].&lt;ref name=rubi/&gt;

Nicola Rubino was an exponent of the artistic cultural current called "[[Scuola romana]]"&lt;ref name=rubi&gt;http://www.nicolarubinoscultore.it%7CSito&lt;/ref&gt; and of the international sculpture of the 20th century. His works, besides being present in various Italian cities, are exhibited in museums and private  collections in Italy and abroad; a valuable collection is kept and exhibited at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art of Alcamo]], inside the l'[[Ex Jesuits' College|ex Collegio dei Gesuiti]].

His very rich artistic production, from the second half of the 1920s to the beginning of the 1980s, was created inside his study in [[via Margutta]]. He liked female figures, that also come back in his paintings realized by Rubino in the last period of his activity, in which he uses a symbolical natural style.&lt;ref&gt;http://servizi2.inps.it/servizi/museomultimediale/autori.aspx?idauthor=157&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942 he took part in the fourth [[Rome Quadriennale]] and in 1948 into the ''Rassegna d'arte figurativa'' (Exposition of figurative art) of Rome. In 1952 he took part in the fifth Rome Quadriennale and in the XXVI [[Venice Biennale]] and his works were then exhibited in foreign countries, among which there were [[Greece]], [[Turkey]] and [[Egypt]].

Between 1953 and 1959 he participated at the ''Mostra d'arte del Mezzogiorno'' (Southern Italy Art Exhibition) of Rome (1953), [[Naples]] (1953 and 1954) where he is assigned the prize ''Salvator Rosa'',&lt;ref name=dilo&gt;Nicola Rubino, Catalogo delle opere a cura di Ernesto Di Lorenzo, Alcamo, promoted by Rotary club of Alcamo, Arti Grafiche Campo, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and then at the ''International Medal Exhibition'' ([[Palazzo Venezia]] in Rome).&lt;ref name=rubi/&gt; In 1953 they assigned him one of the ten prizes at the contest for the ''monument to the Unknown Political Prisoner''.  He took part in the Venice Biennale in 1954 and in he set up a retrospective of medals and exhibited four works at the Rome Quadriennale.

He also works for private customers (Targioni, Fusi, Lombardo from Rome), and as a teacher at ''Scuole Media'' (first-grade secondary school) and [[Liceo artistico]] in Rome.&lt;ref name=dilo/&gt;

In 1956 the [[Ministry of Transport]] commissioned him the portal, in [[Istrian stone]], for the [[Venezia Santa Lucia railway station]]. In this [[bas-Relief]], six metres high and five large, Rubino has represented instraight lines, the history of [[Venice]] through the most important events: the discovery of [[Saint Mark]]'s corpse, the [[Republic of Venice]], the conquest of [[Costantinople]], the [[Battle of Lepanto]] and the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref name=dilo/&gt; In 1958 Rubino participated in the ''Premio Internazionale Città di Carrara'' and, in 1959, at the ''International Medal Exhibition'' at the [[Mint (facility)|Mint]] of [[City of Brussels|Bruxelles]].

In the same year he won a contest proclaimed by the [[Province of Rome]] and realized a bronze [[bas-relief]] for the Technical School "Maffeo Pantaleoni" of Rome.

In 1961 he made the bronze [[bas-reliefs]] for the 18th century Porta Palermo (a Gate) in Alcamo, which were commissioned him by the former [[Lord Mayor]] [[Ludovico Corrao]] and representing  "The poet Cielo d'Alcamo at the court of Federico II"  and  "Active life of Alcamo".&lt;ref name="rep"&gt;http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2007/08/05/il-personaggio.pa_009il.html?refresh_ce&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 he took part in the ''Exposition of Figurative Arts'' of Rome and [[Lazio]] and, with two of his works, at the Contest Exhibition of Figurative Arts of INPS (National Social Insurance Agency); besides he realized fifteen medals that he showed at the "International Exhibition of contemporary religious medal" (Palazzo Braschi in Rome) and five medals at the "Exposicion de la medalla actual" of [[Madrid]] (1964).

Between 1964 and 1973 Rubino won 5 competitions and realized the bronze and marble bas-reliefs for the buildings of [[Lecce]], [[Campobasso]], [[EUR, Rome]], [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and [[Cuneo]]. The bas-relief at the Inps of Rome represents an idealized vision of work: you can see rural and [[Handicraft|handcraft]] life, with a proletarian family in the middle: Rubino wants to intend work as unity and social redemption of it.&lt;ref&gt;http://servizi2.inps.it/servizi/museomultimediale/opera.aspx?id=160&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 he participated, with 5 works, at the IX [[Rome Quadriennale]] and exhibited in Paris, nine medals at the Exposition "La medalle italienne à la Monnale de Paris". Two years later he presented nine medals at the Exhibition of French, Italian and Spanish Medal ([[Palazzo Braschi]]) in Rome.&lt;ref name=rubi/&gt;

Then his works were exhibited in Rome in 1972, as a [[retrospective]] at the gallery ''Il Camino'', and in 1973 at the ''Club Internazionale dell'Antiquariato'' (Antiques). In 1977 Nicola Rubino showed his pictures, in his first painting retrospective, at the Gallery "San Marco" of Rome.

After his death in Rome, his wife and two children ordered that some of his works were donated to the municipality of Alcamo, with the obligation of allocating them in the museum inside the [[Castle of the Counts of Modica (Alcamo)|Castle of the Counts of Modica]]; as a whole, la collezione è composta, oltre a 10 tele, di 27 opere, tra gessi e [[bronzo|bronzi]],the collection is made up, apart 10 paintings, of 27 works (bronzes and [[plasters]])&lt;ref name=dilo/&gt; created between the 1950s and 1960s, and testify how Nicola Rubino always tried the naturalness of shape, of movement:&lt;ref name="rep"/&gt; the "dancer”,  the “Woman combing herself”, the Pharao’s bather”, the “Mother with a child” are some examples of this.

There are also the [[allegorical]] figures: "Justice" (bronze bas-relief [[openwork]]), "Lady Luck", "Woman with a dove"  (plasters),  "The winged horse" (a bronze), and finally, the religious themes, like  "Mater Ecclesiae" (plaster) and the " Stations of the Cross" with four figures (bronze bas-relief).&lt;ref name="rep"/&gt;

In 1999 they entitled the ''Exhibition Room'' of ''Centro Congressi Marconi'' of Alcamo to Nicola Rubino, and on 20 April 2007 they inaugurated the [[plaster casts]] gallery, dedicated to the sculptor, inside the Castle of the Counts of Modica di Alcamo,&lt;ref name=dilo/&gt; later moved to the [[Museum of Contemporary Art of Alcamo]] at the ex Collegio dei Gesuiti.

===Rubino's sculpture and painting===
His works are characterized by an elegant and linear style; Rubino, in the realization of his sculptures, utilized different materials: [[plaster]], bronze, marble or [[clay]] that he was able to model in an admirable way, giving shape to figures which recall the classical world and above all, the hellenic one.  
As the scholar Gioacchino Aldo Ruggieri affirms, Nicola Rubino can be defined a neoclassical artist because his vision of art is a search for an accomplished beauty, like the one expressed by [[Canova]] or [[Foscolo]].&lt;ref name=dilo/&gt;

There is a tight correlation between his sculpture and his painting: according to [[Franco Miele]], Rubino reveals the same ability in modelling a statue or using colour; he is able to express everything with a linear simplicity in both things.&lt;ref name=dilo/&gt;
His works are exhibited in some galleries (Galleria d'Arte Moderna in Rome, Museo di Roma etc.), and in several private collections too.

The '''Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict''' (OSRSG-SVC), is an office of the [[United Nations Secretariat]] tasked with serving the [[United Nations]]' spokesperson and political advocate on conflict-related sexual violence, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict (SRSG-SVC). The Special Representative holds the rank of [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations]] and chairs the UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict.&lt;ref name="unsvc"&gt;[http://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/about-us/about-the-office/ About the Office]&lt;/ref&gt; The mandate of the SRSG-SVC was established by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|Security Council Resolution 1888]], introduced by [[Hillary Clinton]], and the first Special Representative, [[Margot Wallström]], took office in 2010. The current Special Representative is [[Pramila Patten]] of Mauritius, who was appointed by United Nations Secretary General [[António Guterres]] in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sga1719.doc.htm|title=Secretary-General Appoints Pramila Patten of Mauritius Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the SRSG-SVC is supported by the United Nations Team of Experts on the Rule of Law/Sexual Violence in Conflict, co-led by the [[United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations|Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] (DPKO), [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), also established under Security Council Resolution 1888.

==History and Role==

The mandate was established in 2009 by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888]], one in a series of resolutions which recognized the detrimental impact that sexual violence in conflict has on communities, and acknowledged that the crime undermines peace and security efforts. The resolution signaled a change in the way the international community views and responds to conflict-related sexual violence. It is no longer seen as an inevitable by-product of war, but rather a, a crime that is preventable and punishable under international human rights law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.int/pm/special-representative-secretary-general-sexual-violence-conflict-srsgsvc|title=Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict (SRSG/SVC) {{!}} Permanent Missions|website=www.un.int|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the first Special Representative, [[Margot Wallström]] of Sweden took office and in September 2012 [[Zainab Bangura|Zainab Hawa Bagura]] of Sierra Leone took over and served until early 2017. Progress achieved by the Office so far includes:

• Greater visibility, political will and momentum than ever before;

• Development of a robust legislative framework in the Security Council, which has given the Office new tools to drive the mandate to the ground and begin to effect some changes in behaviour;

• More strategic and structured engagement with the security and justice sectors, as part of a prevention strategy;

• Beginning to see some accountability at international and national levels, as a vital aspect of deterrence and prevention;

• Beginning to see national ownership, leadership and responsibility, evident in formal commitments that many governments are making to deal with this problem in their countries as well as commitments by regional organizations.

The three priorities of current SRSG [[Pramila Patten]] are:

i. Converting cultures of impunity into cultures of prevention and deterrence through justice and accountability

ii. Addressing structural gender-based inequality as the root cause and invisible driver of sexual violence in times of war and peace

iii. Fostering national ownership and leadership for a sustainable and holistic survivor-centered response.

According to the 2017 Report of the Secretary-General on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence, the Office focuses on 19 country situations, including 13 conflict settings, four post-conflict countries and two additional situations of concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/key-documents/reports/sg-reports/|title=SG Reports {{!}} United Nations Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Team of Experts ==
The Office's Team of Experts (TOE) on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict works to strengthen the capacity of national rule of law and justice actors to investigate and prosecute for acts of conflict-related sexual violence. The lack of adequate national capacity to deliver justice often leads to widespread impunity and threatens survivors' access to justice, security and safety. The Team of Experts has been operational since 2011 and is the sole Security Council-mandated body tasked with building national capacity to enhance accountability for conflict-related sexual violence. It includes experts from the [[United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations|Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] (DPKO), the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), which serve as co-lead entities. In addition, the Team is complemented by a law enforcement expert seconded by the Government of [[Sweden]] and a reparations expert. Pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|Security Council Resolution 1888]] (2009), the Team focuses on: (i) working closely with national legal and judicial officials and other personnel in the relevant governments’ civilian and military justice systems to address impunity, including by strengthening national capacity and drawing attention to the full range of justice mechanisms to be considered; (ii) identifying gaps in national response and encouraging a holistic national approach in addressing conflict-related sexual violence, including by enhancing criminal accountability, judicial capacity and responsiveness to victims (such as reparations mechanisms); (iii) making recommendations to coordinate domestic and international efforts and resources to reinforce governments’ ability to address conflict-related sexual violence; and (iv) working with other UN mechanisms including UN Missions, Country Teams, and the SRSG-SVC towards the full implementation of resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|1820]] (2008), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|1888]] (2009), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1960|1960]] (2010), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2106|2106]] (2013) and 2331 (2016). In line with its mandate, the Team of Experts provides assistance to governments, including in the areas of criminal investigation and prosecution; military justice; legislative reform; protection of victims and witnesses; reparations for survivors; and security sector oversight. In support of the Office of the SRSG-SVC, the TOE also serves a catalytic role in implementing joint communiqués and frameworks of cooperation agreed between the SRSG-SVC and national authorities, regional actors and other UN entities, complementing the work of UN country presences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/key-documents/reports/team-of-experts-rule-of-lawsexual-violence-in-conflict-reports/|title=Team of Experts Reports {{!}} United Nations Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict (UN Action) ==
UN Action is a cross-UN initiative that unites the work of 14 entities with the goal of ending conflict-related sexual violence. The Chair of UN Action is the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. [[Pramila Patten]]. Endorsed by the Secretary-General's Policy Committee in June 2007, it represents a concerted effort by the UN to work as one by amplifying advocacy, improving coordination and accountability and supporting country efforts to prevent conflict-related sexual violence and respond effectively to the needs of survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stoprapenow.org/about/|title=Stop Rape Now - About|last=luccaco.com|website=stoprapenow.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Action Secretariat is based in the OSRSG-SVC and focuses on three main pillars:

Country-level Action: Strategic support to integrated UN Missions to help them design comprehensive strategies to combat conflict-related sexual violence and targeted support to strengthen joint UN programming.

Advocacy for Action: Raising public awareness and generating political will to address conflict-related sexual violence as part of a broader campaigns to Stop Rape Now and Unite to End Violence Against Women.

Learning by Doing: Creating a knowledge hub on the scale of conflict-related sexual violence and effective responses by the UN and partners.

The 14 entities in the network are: [[United Nations Department of Political Affairs]] (DPA), [[UN Women|United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women]] (UN Women), [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA), [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS), [[United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations|Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] (DPKO), [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office (UN-PBSO), [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR), [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA), [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM).

== Secretary-General's Report on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence ==
The Office publishes the Report of the Secretary-General on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence annually to highlight a number of new and emerging concerns in relation to the use of sexual violence by parties to armed conflict as a tactic of war and terrorism. The report contains an annex of a list of parties credibly suspected of committing or being responsible for patterns of rape or other forms of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict, the majority of whom are non-state actors. It tracks developments relevant to the implementation of Resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|1820]] (2008), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|1888]] (2009) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1960|1960]] (2010) in 19 conflict-affected and post-conflict states and it is compiled through the analysis of data provided by United Nations offices, civil society and regional organizations, as well as Member States. The 2017 Report covers the following countries: Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burundi, Central African Republic, Colombia, Cote d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Iraq, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan (Darfur), Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/key-documents/reports/sg-reports/|title=SG Reports {{!}} United Nations Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10196">'''Pain catastrophizing''' is the tendency to describe a [[pain]] experience in more exaggerated terms than the average person, to ruminate on it more (e.g., "I kept thinking 'this is terrible'"), and/or to feel more helpless about the experience ("I thought it was never going to get better").&lt;ref name="Damme"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Damme | first1 = S. | last2 = Crombez | first2 = G. | last3 = Bijttebier | first3 = P. | last4 = Goubert | first4 = L. | last5 = Houdenhove | first5 = B. V. | year = 2001 | title = A confirmatory factor analysis of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale: invariant factor structure across clinical and non-clinical populations | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304395901004638 | journal = International Association for the Study of Pain | volume = 96 | issue = 3| pages = 319–324 | doi=10.1016/S0304-3959(01)00463-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who report a large number of such thoughts during a pain experience are more likely to rate the pain as more intense than those who report fewer such thoughts.

It is generally assumed that the tendency to [[catastrophize]] plays a causal role in the pain experience – that is, it ''causes'' the person to experience the pain as more intense. One suggestion is that catastrophizing influences pain perception through altering attention and anticipation, and heightening emotional responses to pain.&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;Gracely, R. H. "Pain Catastrophizing and Neural Responses to Pain among Persons with Fibromyalgia." Brain 127.4 (2004): 835-43. Oxford Journals. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; However, we cannot yet rule out the possibility that at least some aspects of catastrophization may actually be the ''product'' of an intense pain experience, rather than its cause. That is, the more intense the pain feels to the person, the more likely they are to have thoughts about it that fit the definition of catastrophization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Severeijns|first1=R|last2=van den Hout|first2=MA|last3=Vlaeyen|first3=JW|title=The causal status of pain catastrophizing: an experimental test with healthy participants.|journal=European Journal of Pain|date=June 2005|volume=9|issue=3|pages=257–65|pmid=15862475|doi=10.1016/j.ejpain.2004.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
The components of catastrophizing that are considered primary were long under debate until the development of the [[Pain Catastrophizing Scale|pain catastrophizing scale]] (PCS). The pain catastrophizing scale is a 13-item self-report scale to measure pain catastrophizing created by Michael J. L. Sullivan, Scott R. Bishop and Jayne Pivik.&lt;ref&gt;The Pain Catastrophizing Scale: Development and Validation, Michael J. L. Sullivan, Scott R. Bishop and Jayne Pivik, Psychological Assessment, 1995, Vol. 7, No. 4, 524-532&lt;/ref&gt; In the PCS, each item is rated on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (all the time). It is broken into three subscales being [[magnification]], [[rumination (psychology)|rumination]], and helplessness. The scale was developed as a self-report measurement tool that provided a valid index of catastrophizing in clinical and non-clinical populations.&lt;ref name="Sull"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sullivan | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Bishop | first2 = S. R. | last3 = Pivik | first3 = J. | year = 1995 | title = The Pain Catastrophizing Scale: Development And Validation | url = | journal = Psychological Assessment | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 524–532 | doi=10.1037/1040-3590.7.4.524}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized &lt;ref&gt;Osman et al., Factor structure, reliability, and validity of the pain catastrophizing scale, Journal of Behavioural medicine, vol.20, no. 6, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; that pain catastrophizing is related to various levels of [[pain]], [[disability|physical disability]] and [[psychological disorder|psychological disability]] in clinical and nonclinical populations.

===Pain catastrophizing scale===

# I worry all the time about whether the pain will end. (H)
# I feel I can't go on. (H)
# It's terrible and I think it's never going to get any better. (H)
# It's awful and I feel that it overwhelms me. (H)
# I feel I can't stand it anymore. (H)
# I become afraid that the pain may get worse. (M)
# I think of other painful experiences. (M)
# I anxiously want the pain to go away. (R)
# I can't seem to keep it out of my mind. (R)
# I keep thinking about how much it hurts. (R)
# I keep thinking about how badly I want the pain to stop. (R)
# There is nothing I can do to reduce the intensity of the pain. (H)
# I wonder whether something serious may happen. (M)
(Note: For the listed items above, (R) Rumination, (M) Magnification, and (H) Helplessness.)

Before the development of the PCS there had been no other [[self-report]] measurement tool that focused primarily on catastrophizing. Other self-report measurement tools such as: the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ), the Pain-Related Self-Statements Scale (PRSS) and the Cognitive Coping Strategy Inventory (CCS) had subscales for assessing catastrophizing but failed to explore specific dimensions of catastrophizing.&lt;ref name="Osman"&gt;The Pain Catastrophizing Scale: Further psychometric evaluation with adult samples. Osman, Augustine; Barrios, Francisco X.; Gutierrez, Peter M.; Kopper, Beverly A.; Merrifield, Traci; Grittmann, Lee
Journal of Behavioral Medicine, Vol 23(4), Aug 2000, 351-365. {{DOI|10.1023/A:1005548801037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the PCS have generally used a self-report design. Participants are asked about pain experiences in their past; they then rate how well various statements fit their thoughts and feelings at the time. Several such studies have shown the PCS to be invariant, with most accuracy in the three oblique factor structure, across [[gender]]s and both clinical and non-clinical groups. The gender focused study expressed that female subjects report more frequent experiences of pain, varied intensity with increased persistence, and lower [[pain tolerance]]s and [[pain threshold|thresholds]].&lt;ref name="deon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = D'Eon | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Harris | first2 = C. A. | last3 = Ellis | first3 = J. A. | year = 2004 | title = Testing Factorial Validity And Gender Invariance Of The Pain Catastrophizing Scale | url = | journal = Journal of Behavioral Medicine | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 361–372 | doi=10.1023/b:jobm.0000042410.34535.64}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to remember that these studies ask participants to report on pain experiences from their past; the overall level of pain experienced is not controlled across genders. If female participants have, on average, experienced more intense and/or persistent pain in their past than male participants, this could also explain their higher endorsement of items relating to pain catastrophizing. Further, more controlled studies are urgently needed to tease apart these issues of cause and effect.

With minimal modification, to address the subject of the catastrophizing, the PCS can also be applied to pain catastrophizing in a social context. The social aspects studied were parents of disabled children and spouses of individuals with [[chronic pain]]. Specifically it has been shown to determine illness related [[stress (biology)|stress]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]] issues that arise from parent's catastrophizing about their child's pain in regards to a disability or illness.&lt;ref name="Goub"&gt;Goubert, L., C. Eccleston, T. Vervoort, A. Jordan, and G. Crombez. "886 Parental Catastrophizing About Their Child'S Pain. The Parent Version Of The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (Pcs-P): A Preliminary Validation." European Journal of Pain 10 (2006): S229. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly with respect to pain catastrophizing between romantic partners, spouse catastrophizing about a partner's chronic pain was related to depressive and pain severity levels in both spouses.&lt;ref name="Cano"&gt;Cano, Annmarie, Michelle T. Leonard, and Aleda Franz. "The Significant Other Version of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS-S): Preliminary Validation." Pain 119.1-3 (2005): 26-37. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications===
Research on pain catastrophizing has found that [[catastrophic thinking]] is associated with a more intense experience of pain. It is generally believed that the catastrophic thoughts '''cause''' the person to experience pain more intensely. This may in turn lead to increased use of [[health care]] and longer [[hospital]] stays.&lt;ref name="Damme" /&gt; Following this logic, if the catastrophic thinking can be addressed, then the person's pain experience might also be reduced, which in turn might reduce health care utilization. The use of scales such as the PCS may be useful for measuring pain catastrophizing in these contexts.&lt;ref name="Grace" /&gt;

==Treatment==
The primary treatment for pain catastrophizing is [[Pain management#Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavior therapy for chronic pain]].&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, A.C., C. Eccleston, and S. Morley, Psychological therapies for the management of chronic pain (excluding headache) in adults. Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 2012. 11: p. CD007407&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically delivered in individual [[psychotherapy]] sessions, or in group pain coping skills classes. These sessions and classes typically span 6 to 12 weeks, and cover a variety of psychobehavioral topics in addition to pain catastrophizing.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; In 2014, researchers at [[Stanford University]] found that a single-session class that they developed specifically to treat pain catastrophizing was effective.&lt;ref name="Darnall"&gt;Darnall BD, Sturgeon JA, Kao MC, Hah JM, Mackey SC. From Catastrophizing to Recovery: a pilot study of a single-session treatment for pain catastrophizing. J Pain Res. 2014 Apr 25;7:219-26. {{DOI|10.2147/JPR.S62329}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to date, there have been no studies that meet the usual standards required for medical treatment intervention studies (for example, where patients are randomly allocated to a treatment or an appropriate control condition, and patients are unaware of which condition is expected to be associated with the better outcome).

'''Seddon L. Bennington''' (8 October 1947 – c. 11 July 2009) was a New Zealand museum [[executive (management)|executive]]. Bennington served as the chief executive of the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]], the national museum of New Zealand, from January 2003 until his death in 2009,&lt;ref name=nzh&gt;{{cite news |first=|last= |title=Te Papa CEO and friend perish in snowy ranges |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10584609|work=[[New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=|date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had also been the director of the [[Carnegie Science Center]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], from 1994 until 2002.&lt;ref name=nzh/&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Seddon Bennington was born in [[Hanmer Springs]], [[North Canterbury]], on the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=dp&gt;{{cite news |first=Greer|last=McDonald|title=Seddon Bennington: A life less ordinary lived to the full |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/features/obituaries/2597780/Seddon-Bennington-A-life-less-ordinary-lived-to-the-full |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion Post]]|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=11 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, Charles and Lillian Jean Bennington, reportedly named their son after former [[New Zealand Prime Minister]] [[Richard Seddon]], whom they admired for his efforts to benefit working class New Zealanders.&lt;ref name=dp/&gt;

Bennington attended Hanmer Springs Primary School, Culverden District High School and Shirley Boys' High School as a student.&lt;ref name=dp/&gt; He credited a teacher at Culverden with introducing him to [[biology]], his favourite subject.&lt;ref name=dp/&gt; An art teacher also took Bennington and other students on a birdwatching trip to [[Kapiti Island]] when he was in seventh grade,&lt;ref name=dp/&gt; and the trip left him with a lifelong appreciation for art and [[nature]].&lt;ref name=dp/&gt;

Bennington joined the [[Volunteer Service Abroad]] in [[Western Samoa]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=nzh/&gt; He then returned to New Zealand to study across the arts and sciences, and during this time also worked as a teacher.&lt;ref name=dp/&gt; 

He obtained his doctorate in [[zoology]] from the [[University of Canterbury]],&lt;ref name=nzh/&gt; and also studied a variety of subjects, including [[New Zealand history]], [[Māori people|Māori]] studies, [[art history]] and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name=nzh/&gt;

Bennington had two sons, Emile and Marcel.

=== Early career ===
Bennington was appointed the head of the [[Otago Settlers Museum|Otago Early Settlers' Museum]] in Dunedin, and then director of the Wellington City Art Gallery, early in his career. He went on to serve as the head of both the [[Scitech|Scitech Discovery Centre]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth, Australia]], and the Division of Professional Services at the [[Western Australian Museum]].&lt;ref name=ppg/&gt; He authored a book entitled, ''Handbook for Small Museums'', while living and working in Australia.&lt;ref name=dp/&gt;

===Carnegie Science Center===
Bennington became the director of the [[Carnegie Science Center]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], in 1994.&lt;ref name=nzh/&gt; He is credited with reviving the [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]] and making the institution financially stable.&lt;ref name=ppg&gt;{{cite news |first=Timothy|last=McNulty |title=Ex-science center chief dies on hike in New Zealand|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09197/984302-84.stm|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|publisher=|date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bennington joined the Carnegie Science Center at the height of the museum's financial and attendance woes.&lt;ref name=ppg/&gt; The museum, which opened a new building in Pittsburgh's [[North Side (Pittsburgh)|North Side]] in 1991, was suffering from [[budget deficit]]s and a wavering mission since its opening three years prior to Bennington's arrival.&lt;ref name=ppg/&gt;

He quickly moved to establish a new vision and mission for the Carnegie Science Center. Much of his strategy centred on the establishment and maintenance of institutional relationships between the Science Center and other cultural, [[scientific]] and business organisations.&lt;ref name=ppg/&gt; He introduced [[Travelling exhibition|travelling exhibits]] to the museum, especially through the former [[UPMC SportsWorks]] complex.&lt;ref name=ppg/&gt;

Bennington became a fixture within Pittsburgh's cultural and artistic communities during his nine-year tenure as director of the museum,&lt;ref name=ppg/&gt; and volunteered with the city's theatre and art groups.&lt;ref name=ppg/&gt;

The reforms which Bennington brought to the Carnegie Science Center proved popular with the general public.&lt;ref name=ppg/&gt; The Carnegie Science Center became the most popular museum of the four [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh]] during his term as director,&lt;ref name=ppg/&gt; and it continues to be the most visited museum of the Carnegie system as of July 2009.&lt;ref name=ppg/&gt;

Bennington departed the Carnegie Science Museum in late 2002 to become director the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]] in his native [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=ppg/&gt;

===Te Papa===
Bennington sought to emphasise and redefine Te Papa's strengths to the public during his six years as the museum's head.&lt;ref name=dp/&gt; He worked with staff to create exhibits which would grab the audience's attention saying, "I want our [[exhibitions]] to be richer in things and richer in information".&lt;ref name=dp/&gt;

One of the highlights of Bennington's tenure was the opening of the "[[Monet]] and the [[Impressionists]]" exhibition at Te Papa in early 2009.&lt;ref name=dp/&gt; The [[Travelling exhibition|travelling exhibit]] featuring Monet's masterpieces arrived at Te Papa following two years of negotiations with the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=dp/&gt; Bennington noted at the time, "It's the most significant collection of works by Monet that will ever have come to [[New Zealand]] or Australia. It's certainly the most valuable exhibition that has come to New Zealand".&lt;ref name=dp/&gt;

==Death==
Seddon Bennington and longtime family friend,&lt;ref name=dp/&gt; Marcella Jackson, 54, disappeared while [[Tramping in New Zealand|tramping]] in the [[Tararua Range]] on the [[North Island]] of New Zealand on 11 July 2009.&lt;ref name=ta&gt;{{cite news |first=Rowan|last=Callick|title=Museum boss dies in snow |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25797519-16953,00.html |work=[[The Australian]]|publisher=|date=18 July 2009 |accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities were alerted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nikki|last=Macdonald|title=How tramp turned to tragedy|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/capital-life/features/4258473/Lost-how-tramp-turned-to-tragedy|accessdate=23 October 2010|work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the pair failed to return from a weekend of tramping, as hiking is called in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=ta/&gt; They had planned to hike from [[Otaki River|Otaki Forks]] to [[Kime Hut]] within the Tararua Range,&lt;ref name=stuff&gt;{{cite news |first=Katherine|last=Newton|title=Te Papa offers help with funeral  |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/2601380/Te-Papa-offers-to-help-with-funeral |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion Post]]|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=17 July 2009 |accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were caught in a sudden winter southerly storm on Saturday, 11 July, on an exposed section of the Tararuas.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt;

===Memorial service===
A [[funeral|memorial service]] and funeral for Bennington was held at the Te Papa museum in Wellington.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; His body was taken to Te Papa's [[marae]] on 21 July 2009.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; 

Bennington's family members carried his coffin to the entrance of the marae,&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; where it was given to Te Papa staff members who carried it up the stairs accompanied by Māori instrumental music and [[conch shells]].&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; Bennington's casket was then returned to his family at the top of the stairs, to be carried onto the marae.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt;

Bennington's coffin was greeted by Te Papa's staff with a [[haka]],&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; and was then placed on a stage in the center of the marae and covered with three [[kahu kiwi]] ([[kiwi]] feather coats) as a sign of respect.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; One of the kiwi cloaks had been used for the [[Tangihanga|tangi]], or funeral, of former Prime Minister Richard Seddon in 1906.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; The cloak was significant not only because Bennington was named after the Prime Minister, but also because Bennington had personally accepted the cloak from the Seddon family as a donation to Te Papa.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; The second cloak was originally from Tuhoe, where Bennington spent time during his younger years.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; The third kiwi cloak used to cover Bennington's coffin had been used previously to repatriate the remains of New Zealanders who died abroad back to their homeland.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt;

Te Papa spokesperson Jane Keig noted the significance of the kiwi cloaks in Bennington's memorial service, ''"Kahu kiwi are very chiefly cloaks."''&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; She explained that the placing the kahu kiwis over the coffin symbolises, ''"keeping the person warm as he starts making his way towards the [[ancestors]]."''&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt;

Bennington funeral was held on 22 July 2009, at the marae at Te Papa in Wellington.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt;

'''Simon''' (c. 1947 – 28 November 1949) was the [[ship's cat]] who served on the [[Royal Navy]] [[sloop]]  [[HMS Amethyst (U16)|HMS ''Amethyst'']]. In 1949, during the [[Yangtze Incident]], he received the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals|PDSA]]'s [[Dickin Medal]] after surviving injuries from a cannon shell, raising [[morale]], and killing off a rat infestation during his service.&lt;ref name=pnf&gt;[http://www.purr-n-fur.org.uk/famous/simon.html Simon of HMS ''Amethyst'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Simon was found wandering the dockyards of [[Hong Kong]] in March 1948 by 17-year-old Ordinary Seaman George Hickinbottom, a member of the crew of the British frigate [[HMS Amethyst (F116)|HMS ''Amethyst'']] stationed in the city in the late 1940s. At this stage, it is thought Simon was approximately a year old, and was very undernourished and unwell. Hickinbottom smuggled the cat aboard ship, and Simon soon ingratiated himself with the crew and officers, particularly because he was adept at catching and killing rats on the lower decks. Simon rapidly gained a reputation for cheekiness, leaving presents of dead rats in sailors' beds, and sleeping in the captain's cap.&lt;ref name=pnf /&gt;

The crew viewed Simon as a lucky mascot, and when the ship's commander changed later in 1948, the outgoing Ian Griffiths left the cat for his successor, Lieutenant Commander Bernard Skinner, who took an immediate liking to the friendly animal. However, Skinner's first mission in command of the ''Amethyst'' was to travel up the [[Yangtze River]] to [[Nanjing]] to replace the duty ship there, [[HMS Consort|HMS ''Consort'']]. Halfway up the river the ship became embroiled in the [[Amethyst Incident|''Amethyst'' Incident]], when Chinese Communist gun batteries opened fire on the frigate. One of the first rounds tore through the captain's cabin, seriously wounding Simon. Lieutenant Commander Skinner died of his wounds soon after the attack.

==Recovery==
The badly wounded cat crawled on deck, and was rushed to the medical bay, where the ship's surviving medical staff cleaned his burns, and removed four pieces of [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]], but he  was not expected to last the night. He managed to survive, however, and after a period of recovery, returned to his former duties in spite of the indifference he faced from the new captain Lieutenant Commander [[John Kerans]]. While anchored in the river, the ship had become overrun with rats, and Simon took on the task of removing them with vigour, as well as raising the morale of the sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/devon/7072669.stm|title=Wartime hero cat Simon remembered|author=|date=1 November 2007|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ship's escape from the Yangtze, Simon became an instant celebrity, lauded in British and world news, and presented with the "Animal [[Victoria Cross]]", the [[Dickin Medal]]; as of 2018, Simon is the only cat to win the award. He was also awarded a [[Blue Cross (animal charity)|Blue Cross]] medal, the [[Naval General Service Medal (1915)|''Amethyst'' campaign medal]], and the fanciful rank of "Able Seacat". Thousands of letters were written to him, so much that one Lt. Stewart Hett was appointed "cat officer" to deal with Simon's post. At every port ''Amethyst'' stopped at on its route home, Simon was presented with honour, and a special welcome was made for him at [[Plymouth]] in November when the ship returned. Simon was, however, like all animals entering the UK, subject to quarantine regulations, and was immediately sent to an animal centre in [[Surrey]].

==Death==
Whilst in quarantine, Simon contracted a virus and, despite the attentions of medical staff and thousands of well-wishers, died on 28 November 1949 from a complication of the viral infection caused by his war wounds. Hundreds, including the entire crew of HMS ''Amethyst'', attended his funeral at the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals|PDSA]] [[Ilford Animal Cemetery]] in east London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/yw/2004/01/24/stories/2004012400060200.htm|title=Cat of war|first=Santhini|last=Govindan|date=Jan 24, 2004|website=www.hindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His gravestone reads:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4617">As per 2014, more than 70 medical schools in the United States offer courses on spirituality and medicine. The [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] (AAMC) has co-sponsored, with the National Institute for Healthcare Research, 4 conferences, on curricular development in spirituality and medicine since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Puchalski, C. M., Blatt, B., Kogan, M., &amp; Butler, A. (2014). Spirituality and health: the development of a field. Academic Medicine, 89(1), 10–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessing spirituality ==
Asking patients questions about the meaning of life, their acceptance of their own or others' failures, and how they experience connectedness with others should have the goal of assessing how satisfied the patient is with the answers to these questions.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Mertie L., and Mary D. Moller. Psychiatric mental health nursing: from suffering to hope. Boston, Pearson, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; By developing personal relationships with their patients and their families, health professionals can better assess patients' spiritual situation.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, L. (2005). Spirituality, Suffering, Illness. Philadelphia, PA: F.A. Davis, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of opening questions in a spiritual assessment are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Mertie L., and Mary D. Moller. Psychiatric mental health nursing: from suffering to hope. Boston, Pearson, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''"Do you have a religious preference?"''
* ''"Are there any spiritual or religious practices that are important to you?"''
* ''"Would you like for us to contact your clergy member or religious advisor?".''

==Role of spirituality in illness==

The prospect of death may lead a patient to deal with questions related to meaning of life, such as "Why is this happening to me?" or "Is there a God?"&lt;ref&gt;Puchalski, C. M. (2001). The role of spirituality in health care. Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings. 14(4), 352–357. Retrieved from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1305900/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-care==

Li and Shun (2016) focused on self care coping styles in patients with [[Heart failure|chronic heart failure]] found that spiritual and religious support affects heart failure patients coping with both physical and psychological self-care.&lt;ref&gt;Li, C. C., &amp; Shun, S. C. (2016). Understanding self care coping styles in patients with chronic heart failure: A systematic review. European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing, 15(1), 12–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications in health care==
{{expand section|date=December 2017}}
&lt;!-- So, how is spirituality actually being used in health care professions? --&gt;

===Third-party professional aid===
Ill individuals and their families may request referrals for services such as a [[chaplain]], psychologist, or [[social work]]er who can address their spiritual concerns. Providers who are uncomfortable accommodating an integrative approach to care should consult with other practitioners skilled in providing spiritual care, so that patients can integrate spiritual support into their own self-care.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton-Jones, D., &amp; Haglund, K. (2016). The role of spirituality and religiosity in persons living with sickle cell disease: a review of the literature. Journal of Holistic Nursing, 34(4), 351-360.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The concept of "spirituality" in health care has been criticised. Salander and Hamberg question the usefulness of Puchalsky's definition:
{{quote|A prerequisite for a meaningful concept is that it is demarcated in relation to other concepts. Puchalski and colleagues' conceptualization of spirituality lacks this demarcation – it unfortunately qualifies as an example of what Sartori called "conceptual stretching." It becomes a popular catch-all term – it means everything and, therefore, nothing.{{sfn|Salander|Hamberg|2014}}}}

[[Image:Sporic meiosis.svg|thumb|300px|Spores produced in a sporic life cycle.]]
[[Image:Brachythecium rutabulum on Populus x canadensis.jpg|thumb|300px|Fresh snow partially covers Rough-stalked Feather-moss ''([[Bryopsida|Brachythecium rutabulum]])'', growing on a [[thinning|thinned]] hybrid black poplar ''([[populus|Populus x canadensis]])''. The last stage of the [[moss#Life cycle|moss lifecycle]] is shown, where the [[sporophyte]]s are visible before dispersion of their spores: the [[calyptra]] ('''1''') is still attached to the [[sporangium|capsule]] ('''2'''). The tops of the [[gametophytes]] ('''3''') can be discerned as well. Inset shows the surrounding, black poplars growing on sandy [[loam]] on the bank of a [[bog pond|kolk]], with the detail area marked.]]

In [[biology]], a '''spore''' is a unit of [[sexual reproduction|sexual]] or [[asexual reproduction]] that may be adapted for [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] and for survival, often for extended periods of time, in unfavourable conditions. Spores form part of the [[Biological life cycle|life cycles]] of many [[plant]]s, [[algae]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[protozoa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/searchresults.html?cx=009557456284541951685%3A50nf_5tpvuq&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=spore&amp;sa=Search Tree Of Life Web Project]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bacterial spore]]s are not part of a sexual cycle but are resistant structures used for survival under unfavourable conditions. [[Myxozoa]]n spores release amoebulae into their hosts for parasitic infection, but also reproduce within the hosts through the pairing of two nuclei within the plasmodium, which develops from the amoebula.&lt;ref&gt;"Myxozoa." Tree of Life web project. Ivan Fiala 10 July 2008. Web. 14 Jan. 2014. &lt;http://tolweb.org/Myxozoa/2460&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Spores are usually [[haploid]] and [[unicellular]] and are produced by [[meiosis]] in the [[sporangium]] of a [[diploid]] [[sporophyte]]. Under favourable conditions the spore can develop into a new [[organism]] using [[mitosis|mitotic]] division, producing a [[multicellular]] [[gametophyte]], which eventually goes on to produce gametes. Two gametes fuse to form a [[zygote]] which develops into a new sporophyte. This cycle is known as [[alternation of generations]].

The spores of [[seed plant]]s, however, are produced internally and the megaspores, formed within the ovules and the microspores are involved in the formation of more complex structures that form the dispersal units, the [[seed]]s and [[pollen]] grains.

==Definition==
The term ''spore'' derives from the [[ancient Greek]] word σπορά ''spora'', meaning "[[seed]], sowing", related to σπόρος ''sporos'', "sowing," and σπείρειν ''speirein'', "to sow."

In common parlance, the difference between a "spore" and a "[[gamete]]" (both together called gonites) is that a spore will germinate and develop into a [[sporeling]], while a gamete needs to combine with another gamete to form a zygote before developing further.

The main difference between spores and seeds as [[Biological dispersal|dispersal units]] is that spores are unicellular, while seeds contain within them a multicellular gametophyte that produces a developing embryo, the multicellular sporophyte of the next generation. Spores germinate to give rise to haploid gametophytes, while seeds germinate to give rise to diploid sporophytes.

==Classification of spore-producing organisms==
===Plants===
[[Vascular plant]] spores are always [[haploid]]. Vascular plants are either '''homosporous (or isosporous)''' or '''heterosporous'''. Plants that are homosporous produce spores of the same size and type. 

Heterosporous plants, such as [[seed plant]]s, [[spikemoss]]es, [[Isoëtes|quillworts]], and ferns of the order [[Salviniales]] produce spores of two different sizes: the larger spore (megaspore) in effect functioning as a "female" spore and the smaller (microspore) functioning as a "male". Such plants typically give rise to the two kind of spores from within separate sporangia, either a '''megasporangium''' that produces megaspores or a '''microsporangium''' that produces microspores. In flowering plants, these sporangia occur within the carpel and anthers, respectively.

===Fungi===
[[Fungus|Fungi]] commonly produce spores, as a result of sexual, or asexual, reproduction. Spores are always [[haploid]] and grow into mature haploid individuals through [[mitosis|mitotic]] division of cells. In multicellular species, the visible fungus is composed entirely of haploid cells. Only during sexual reproduction are [[diploid]] cells present, as a result of the fusion of two haloid gamate cells. These diploid cells produce the haploid spores.

==Classification of spores==
Spores can be classified in several ways:

===By spore-producing structure===
[[Image:Morelasci.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ascus|Asci]] of ''[[Morchella elata]]'', containing [[ascospores]]]]
[[Image:Microspore-formation.svg|thumb|300px|In [[plant]]s, [[microspore]]s, and in some cases megaspores, are formed from all four products of meiosis.]]
[[Image:Macrospore-formation.svg|thumb|300px|In contrast, in many [[seed plant]]s and heterosporous [[fern]]s, only a single product of meiosis will become a [[megaspore]] (macrospore), with the rest degenerating.]]
====Fungi====
In fungi and fungus-like organisms, spores are often classified by the structure in which meiosis and spore production occurs. Since fungi are often classified according to their spore-producing structures, these spores are often characteristic of a particular [[taxon]] of the [[fungi]].
* '''[[Sporangiospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[sporangium]] in many fungi such as [[zygomycete]]s.
* '''[[Zygospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[zygosporangium]], characteristic of [[zygomycete]]s.
* '''[[Ascospore]]s''': spores produced by an [[ascus]], characteristic of [[ascomycete]]s.

===By origin during life cycle===
* '''Meiospores''': spores produced by [[meiosis]]; they are thus [[haploid]], and give rise to a haploid daughter cell(s) or a haploid individual. Examples are the precursor cells of [[gametophyte]]s of [[seed plant]]s found in [[flower]]s ([[angiosperm]]s) or [[Conifer cone|cones]] ([[gymnosperm]]s), and the [[zoospore]]s produced from meiosis in the sporophytes of algae such as ''[[Ulva (genus)|Ulva]]''.
** '''[[Microspore]]s''': meiospores that give rise to a male [[gametophyte]], ([[pollen]] in seed plants).
** '''[[Megaspore]]s''' (or '''macrospores'''): meiospores that give rise to a female [[gametophyte]], (in seed plants the gametophyte forms within the [[ovule]]).
* '''[[conidium|Mitospores]]''' (or '''conidia''', '''conidiospores'''): spores produced by [[mitosis]]; they are characteristic of [[Ascomycetes]]. Fungi in which only mitospores are found are called "mitosporic fungi" or "anamorphic fungi", and are previously classified under the [[taxon]] [[Deuteromycota]] (See [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph]]).

===By mobility===
Spores can be differentiated by whether they can [[motility|move]] or not.
* '''[[Zoospore]]s''': mobile spores that move by means of one or more [[flagellum|flagella]], and can be found in some [[algae]] and [[fungi]].
* '''[[Aplanospore]]s''': immobile spores that may nevertheless potentially grow flagella.
* '''[[Autospore]]s''': immobile spores that cannot develop flagella.
* '''[[Ballistospore]]s''': spores that are forcibly discharged or ejected from the fungal [[fruiting body]] as the result of an internal force, such as buildup of pressure. Most [[basidiospore]]s are also ballistospores, and another notable example is spores of the genus ''[[Pilobolus]]''.
* '''[[Statismospore]]s''': spores that are discharged from the fungal fruiting body as the result of an external force, such as raindrops or a passing animal. Examples are [[puffball]]s.

==Anatomy==
Under high [[magnification]], spores can be categorized as either '''monolete spores''' or '''trilete spores'''. In monolete spores, there is a single line on the spore indicating the axis on which the mother spore was split into four along a vertical axis. In trilete spores, all four spores share a common origin and are in contact with each other, so when they separate, each spore shows three lines radiating from a center pole.

==Dispersal==
[[File:Fungus spore ejection.ogg|thumb|Spores being ejected by fungi.]]

In fungi, both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores of many fungal species are actively dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as travelling through the air over long distances. Many fungi thereby possess specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms as well as spore-surface structures, such as [[hydrophobin]]s, for spore ejection. These mechanisms include, for example, forcible discharge of ascospores enabled by the structure of the ascus and accumulation of [[osmolyte]]s in the fluids of the ascus that lead to explosive discharge of the ascospores into the air.&lt;ref name="Trail"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trail F.|year= 2007|title=Fungal cannons: explosive spore discharge in the Ascomycota|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=276|pages=12–8|pmid=17784861|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00900.x|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forcible discharge of single spores termed ''ballistospores'' involves formation of a small drop of water ([[Buller's drop]]), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000 [[G-force|g]].&lt;ref name="Pringle et al."&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pringle A, Patek SN, Fischer M, Stolze J, Money NP |year= 2005|title=The captured launch of a ballistospore|journal=[[Mycologia]]|volume=97|pages=866–71|pmid=16457355|doi=10.3852/mycologia.97.4.866|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fungi rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces, exemplified by [[puffballs]]. Attracting insects, such as flies, to fruiting structures, by virtue of their having lively colours and a putrid odour, for dispersal of fungal spores is yet another strategy, most prominently used by the [[stinkhorns]].

In Common Smoothcap moss (''[[Atrichum undulatum]]''), the vibration of sporophyte has been shown to be an important mechanism for spore release.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson, Lönnell, Sundberg and Hylander (2014) Release thresholds for moss spores: the importance of turbulence and sporophyte length. Journal of Ecology, n/a-n/a.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of spore-shedding [[vascular plant]]s such as [[fern]]s, wind distribution of very light spores provides great capacity for dispersal. Also, spores are less subject to animal predation than seeds because they contain almost no food reserve; however they are more subject to fungal and bacterial predation. Their chief advantage is that, of all forms of progeny, spores require the least energy and materials to produce.

In the spikemoss ''[[Selaginella lepidophylla]]'', dispersal is achieved in part by an unusual type of [[diaspore (botany)|diaspore]], a [[tumbleweed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = False Rose of Jericho – Selaginella lepidophyllaFalse Rose of Jericho – Selaginella lepidophylla | work = Plant- and Flower guide| date = February 2009| url = http://www.plant-and-flower-guide.com/rose-of-jericho.html | accessdate = 1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steven Francis Moore''' (born September 22, 1978) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] former professional [[ice hockey]] [[Center (ice hockey)|center]] who played in parts of three [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) seasons with the [[Colorado Avalanche]].

Moore is widely known for suffering a career-ending injury as a result of [[Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident|an on-ice attack from behind]] by then-[[Vancouver Canucks]] forward [[Todd Bertuzzi]] in 2004. The fall-out from the event has contributed to a growing effort to curb gratuitous violence in hockey, and professional sports in general.

==Playing career ==
Steve Moore was drafted by the [[Colorado Avalanche]] in the [[1998 NHL Entry Draft]] in the second round, the 53rd pick overall. Moore played in 69 games for the Avalanche from 2001 to 2004, scoring five goals and seven assists, all of which were scored in the latter season, before being seriously injured by [[Todd Bertuzzi]] who at the time played for the [[Vancouver Canucks]] (see below). At the time of the incident, the Avalanche were first overall in the NHL standings, and Moore was playing on the Avalanche's top line, on Right Wing, with linemates [[Joe Sakic]] (Center), and [[Paul Kariya]] (Left Wing).

=== The Bertuzzi incident ===
{{main|Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident}}
On February 16, 2004, during a Vancouver-Colorado game, Moore injured Canucks team captain [[Markus Näslund]] with a high hit while Näslund was reaching for a puck through centre ice. Moore contacted Näslund's head in the play. No penalty was called in connection with the hit, but Näslund suffered a concussion and a bone chip in his elbow as a result, and missed three games. After reviewing tapes of the hit, the NHL ruled that the hit was legal and did not fine or suspend Moore. Canucks head coach [[Marc Crawford]] and general manager [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]] publicly criticized the non-call by the referees on the incident. 

During the next game between the Canucks and Avalanche held in Denver, NHL commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] and NHL executive vice-president [[Colin Campbell (ice hockey executive)|Colin Campbell]] attended the game, which ended in a tie and saw no major incidents break out.

However, on March 8, 2004, during another rematch between the Avalanche and Canucks, things went differently. In the first period, Moore fought Vancouver player [[Matt Cooke]] in a fairly even brawl, and served the 5-minute penalty for fighting. The Avalanche would go on to build up a large lead of 8-2 in a fight-filled game. Late in the third period, [[Todd Bertuzzi]] was sent onto the ice. After failing to instigate Moore to fight, Bertuzzi skated after Moore, pulled him back by the jersey and punched him in the back of the head. As Moore fell unconscious to the ice, Bertuzzi's weight and momentum drove Moore's head into the ice.  Moore's teammate [[Andrei Nikolishin]] and Bertuzzi's teammate [[Sean Pronger]] then piled on to Moore and Bertuzzi.  Moore was knocked out and lay motionless for ten minutes before being carried off on a [[stretcher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=240308022 ESPN Game Summary. 28th March 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the hit, fall, and piling-on had resulted in three fractured [[Cervical vertebrae|neck vertebrae]], facial cuts and a [[concussion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070309/steve_moore_070309/20070309?hub%3DCanada |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318025304/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070309/steve_moore_070309/20070309?hub=Canada |archivedate=2007-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bertuzzi was assessed a match penalty for his actions, which carries an automatic indefinite suspension under NHL rules.  On March 11, 2004, the NHL announced Bertuzzi would remain suspended for at least the remainder of the Canucks' season, including any playoff games.  The [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]] subsequently honoured the NHL suspension, preventing Bertuzzi playing in any international tournaments or leagues during the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]].

On August 22, 2004, Moore was released from a Denver-area hospital. He wore a neck [[brace (orthopaedic)|brace]] for one year and then started [[physical therapy]] for his neck injury and concussion.

On February 17, 2005, Moore filed a civil lawsuit against Bertuzzi. Also named were [[Brad May]] (who was quoted as saying that there would  "definitely be a bounty on Moore's head" after the game), Brian Burke and the Canucks organization. The lawsuit was thrown out in October 2005, with the judge suggesting that the lawsuit be re-filed in Canada, where the incident took place. The lawsuit was re-filed in Canada, in February 2006.&lt;ref name="MooreLawsuit"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=142413&amp;hubname=nhl |title=Moore plans to file appeal in civil case |accessdate=2007-11-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929173940/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=142413&amp;hubname=nhl |archivedate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On August 8, 2005, NHL Commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] announced that Bertuzzi would be allowed to play again at the start of the [[2005–06 NHL season]].&lt;ref name="Reinstatement"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nhl.com/news/2005/08/232342.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719003929/http://www.nhl.com/news/2005/08/232342.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-19 |title=NHL reinstates Vancouver's Todd Bertuzzi |accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=NHL.com |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the league's decision, they cited many reasons for ending the suspension, such as: 
*Bertuzzi serving a suspension of 20 games, which at the time tied for 4th longest in NHL history (13 regular season games, 7 playoff games)&lt;ref name="SuspensionLength"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proicehockey.about.com/cs/history/a/nhl_suspensions.htm|title=The Longest NHL Suspensions|accessdate=2007-11-21|author=Fitzpatrick, Jamie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bertuzzi's forfeited salary ($501,926.39 [[United States dollar|USD]])
*Significant uncertainty, anxiety, stress and emotional pain caused to Bertuzzi's family
*The commissioner's belief that Bertuzzi was genuinely remorseful and apologetic for his actions

On August 12, 2005, Brian Burke, formerly Vancouver's general manager who was now serving in the same capacity with the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, had made an offer to Moore. It was a [[two-way contract]] that would have paid Moore $475,000 US in the NHL and $75,000 if the player suited up for Portland, the Ducks' [[American Hockey League]] affiliate. Moore's lawyer Tim Danson described the offer as a self-serving attempt by Burke (who was a defendant in the lawsuit) to mitigate potential legal damages, by attempting to suggest Moore was a minor league player. Further, Danson said that Moore would return to the Avalanche except that Moore was not medically cleared to play hockey, which Brian Burke was well aware of, and described it as adding insult to injury.

On August 15, 2005, Bertuzzi broke his 17-month-long silence by expressing a desire to move on with his life. "I'm sure just like Steve Moore and his family, it's been difficult for both parties. I know I wish that day never happened. It's been some tough times, but I've got good family and good friends and good peers in the league that have helped me get over the hump and move forward and come through it."&lt;ref name="Never happened"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2134946|title=Bertuzzi: 'I wish that day never happened'|accessdate=2007-02-27|publisher=ESPN.com|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2005, Moore's Toronto-based lawyer, Tim Danson, said that Moore was skating and doing regular workouts, but continued to suffer concussion-related symptoms.&lt;ref name="MooreLawsuit"/&gt;  He continued working out for some years afterward, but had to abandon his comeback attempt when it became apparent he would never be medically cleared to return to the ice again.

In July, 2012, former Avalanche [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]] [[Scott Parker (ice hockey)|Scott Parker]], who had been a teammate of Moore's very briefly the season prior to the Bertuzzi incident in 2004, made some controversial comments. In an interview with milehighhockey.com, Parker was quoted as saying "he (Moore) went to Harvard, you know what, blow me. College grad. I never went to college, but I can kick your ass. I'll bring you right down to my IQ level if you want. I'll hit you about four times in the skull, that'll bring you right down." &lt;ref&gt;An Afternoon With Former Avalanche Enforcer Scott Parker: Part 2 http://www.milehighhockey.com/2012/7/18/3151979/an-afternoon-with-former-avalanche-enforcer-scott-parker-part-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker defends Bertuzzi attack http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/2012/07/18/20001901.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil lawsuit====

On February 16, 2006, Moore filed a civil suit in the province of [[Ontario]] against Bertuzzi, the Canucks, and the parent company of the Canucks, ''Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment'' for the loss of his NHL career, in his Rookie Year. The lawsuit was seeking $15 million in pecuniary damages for loss of income, $1 million for aggravated damages, and $2 million for punitive damages. Moore's lawyer filed the suit one day before its two-year limitation expired, saying it was because Steve Moore did not want to file the suit and waited until the last minute while he tried to attain medical clearance to resume his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2006/02/15/bertuzzi060215.html | publisher = [[CBC News]] | date = 2006-02-15 | title = Bertuzzi hit with lawsuit | accessdate = 2009-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bettman attempted to get Bertuzzi and Moore to agree on an out-of-court settlement in the {{currency|19.5 million|CAD}} lawsuit filed by Moore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/story/9873254 Pittsburgh Penguins, Sidney Crosby, National Hockey League - CBSSports.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207061223/http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/story/9873254 |date=2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bertuzzi offered $350,000 to settle the case, an amount which was called "an insult" by Moore's lawyer.&lt;ref name="Insult"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/Sports/article/273827|title=Bertuzzi offered Moore $350,000|accessdate=2007-11-21|author=Westhead, Rick | work=The Star | location=Toronto | date=November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2008, Bertuzzi filed a lawsuit against Crawford, alleging that he was contractually obliged to obey Crawford and that therefore Crawford shares responsibility for the injury to Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crawford brought into Moore lawsuit|url=http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080328.wsptbert28/GSStory/GlobeSportsHockey/home|accessdate=2008-08-19|date=2008-03-28|publisher=Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Crawford later stated that Bertuzzi acted in "direct disobedience" to orders from the bench to get off the ice before attacking Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bertuzzi acted in 'direct disobedience': Crawford|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2008/08/19/nhl-bertuzzi-crawford.html|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2008-08-19|date=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 14, 2013, The Toronto Star reported that both Moore v. Bertuzzi, et al. and Bertuzzi v. Crawford would begin, after having been postponed several times, in April 2013. Both cases will be held in the Ontario Superior Court before a six-person jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/nhl/article/1314614--bertuzzi-moore-court-documents-shed-light-on-ex-nhl-player-s-struggles|title=

==Personal ==
Steve Moore's older brother [[Mark Moore (ice hockey)|Mark]], and younger brother, [[Dominic Moore|Dominic]], all played four years at [[Harvard University]]. Because of their relative closeness in age, all three were able to play in the same year for Harvard during the 1999–2000 season. Dominic also went on to play in the NHL.

'''Suicide in Kazakhstan''' is a common cause of [[unnatural death]] in the country and a long term [[social issue]]. According to the 2011 report of [[World Health Organization]], of all the people reported dead due to [[suicide]] worldwide every year, 3.23% belong to [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name="Suicide rate WR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide rate|url=http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/kazakhstan-suicide|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide of teenage and young age people is a big issue in the country.&lt;ref name="Kazakhstan: Concerns Over Adolescent Suicides" /&gt;

== Statistics ==
The country has highest number of recorded suicides among girls aged 15 to 19, and for boys, it is the second highest after [[Russia]]. A [[UNICEF]] report of 2009 shows, between 1999 and 2008 the number of suicides among young people of the country increased by 23%.&lt;ref name="Kazakhstan: Concerns Over Adolescent Suicides"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan: Concerns Over Adolescent Suicides|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,45a5fb512,45a5fbee2,4da7ebfa15,0,,,KAZ.html|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Raisa Sher, head of the country's education ministry's child protection committee, there are several factors behind such high rates of suicide among people of a young age, such as:&lt;ref name="Kazakhstan: Concerns Over Adolescent Suicides" /&gt;
* [[School bullying]]
* Absence or loss of values
* Falling standards of social behavior
* Alienation

'''Talat Mahmood''' (24 February 1924 – 9 May 1998) is considered one of the greatest male [[India]]n non-classical and semi-classical singers. He was a born singer with an intuitive sense of beauty, charm and grace. He was an Indian playback singer. Although he tried his luck as a film actor, he didn't succeed a great deal in acting.

Talat received [[Padma Bhushan]] in 1992, in recognition of his artistic contributions in the spheres of cinematic and ghazal music.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had a unique, elegant and profoundly artistic style of singing. Talat was a very gifted singer in every sense. He was particularly famous for singing soft and sombre semi-classical and non-classical ''[[ghazal]]''s, but the film songs sung by him are also considered critically flawless and outstanding. Although Talat's typical genre was Ghazal, he was an astoundingly brilliant film singer who sung innumerable fantastic film songs.

Romantic and tragic were the moods he liked most and it was he who helped a great deal in shaping the style and method of modern ghazal singing. He can be described as the real founder of modern semi-classical and non-classical ghazal. During the 1950s and 60s, Talat was the first choice of the high-brow literary and artistic community of Indian sub-continent, especially Urdu-speaking community. Even his cancelled songs were immensely popular among them. No other singer had such intellectually high-class and learned audience at the time with an exception of Manna Dey. Talat's voice has often been described as the softest male voice of the Indian sub-continent; not only this, but his voice is also considered among the most soulful male voices ever heard in the Indian sub-continent.

== Early life ==
Talat Mahmood was born in [[Lucknow]], Uttar Pradesh, to Manzoor Mahmood. Talat showed his musical leanings from a very young age and would enjoy sitting through all-night music soirees listening patiently to some of the biggest names in classical Indian music then.

Coming from a conservative Muslim background, singing was not encouraged. Talat had to choose between working in films and staying at home. Despite his parental objection he opted for the former, though his family accepted the fact only about a decade later when he gained respect in the industry.

== Singing career ==
Talat apprenticed classical music under Pandit S.C.R. Bhat at Marris College of Music, Lucknow (presently [[Bhatkhande Music Institute]]) some time in late-30s. He started his career purely as a ''ghazal'' singer in 1939. Talat Mahmood began his singing career at the age of 16 in 1939 when he began singing the ''[[Ghazal]]''s of Daag, Mir, Jigar etc. on [[All India Radio]], Lucknow. His voice had a quality distinct from all the other singers. [[HMV]] was quick to notice this and offered Talat his first disc in 1941 ''Sab din ek samaan nahin tha, Bun jaoon ga kya se kya main, Iska to kuch dhyan nahin tha''.

His reputation as a ''ghazal'' singer was not limited to his hometown of Lucknow, but it reached the city that proved to shape his destiny – Calcutta. The then famous ''ghazal'' singers were [[Ustad Barkat Ali Khan]], [[K.L. Saigal]] and [[M.A. Rauf]]. The classical songs he sang were " Sapnon Ki Suhaani Duniyaa Ko " for film Shikast and " Laage Tose Naina " for Chaandi Ki Deewar.

In 1944 came the hit ''Tasveer teri dil mera behela nah sake gi''. Its popularity was so phenomenal and unrivalled that even today it remains one of the top selling non-film discs{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. This disc brought Talat the fame throughout India and soon he was beckoned by the Calcutta film industry. Talat made cameo appearances and starred in about 16 movies, for both the [[Calcutta]] (film hub of the 1940s) and Bombay Film Industry. The three movies in which he starred were regional hits in Calcutta. Initially, in Calcutta, he recorded a lot of Bangla songs (basic album) under the assumed name of "Tapankumar". Several of his Bangla numbers were super hits in Bengal and are still aired on All India Radio old song reminisces. He sang to the tune of eminent music directors like Kamal Dasgupta [" Du'ti paakhi du'ti teere... "], Sudhin Dasgupta [" Ei rimjhimjhim barosha... "], Rabin Chattopadhyayaa [ " Chander eto aalo... " ], Hemanta Mukhopadhayay [ " E Jodi aakash hoy... " ] and V. Balsara [ " Tumi sundar jodi nahi... " ] during the 50s and early 60s.

In 1949 Talat moved to [[Mumbai|Bombay]], to sing for the Hindi film industry. His name and fame had already preceded him and soon he was flooded with offers. His big break came with the song ''Ae dil mujhe aisi jagha le chal jahan koi na ho'' composed by music director [[Anil Biswas (composer)|Anil Biswas]] for the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Arzoo (1950 film)|Arzoo]]''. The song proved to be extremely popular.

== Legacy and significance ==
[[File:Talat Mahmood 2016 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|Mahmood on a 2016 stamp of India]]
Talat Mehmood was the real founder of modern semi-classical and non-classical ghazal. So, his influence upon other contemporary and succeeding ghazal singers has been broad and profound. It was he who paved the way for such legendary ghazal singers as ''[[Mehdi Hassan]]'' and ''[[Jagjit Singh]]''. Hence he will always be placed very high for his contributions to transform and revitalize the whole art and form ghazal singing.

Talat Mehmood can safely be placed among the greatest male gazal and/or film singers of the Indian subcontinent together with the singers like ''[[K. L. Saigal]]'', ''[[Mohammed Rafi]]'', ''[[Ahmed Rushdi]]'', ''[[Mehdi Hassan]]'', ''[[Manna Dey]]'', ''[[K. J. Yesudas]]'', Ustad ''[[Amanat Ali Khan]]'', ''[[Kishore Kumar]]'', ''[[Jagjit Singh]]'', Ustad ''[[Ghulam Ali (singer)|Ghulam Ali]]'' and ''[[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]]''. Because of his soft and silky voice, subtly intricate and detailed method, correct pronunciation, infallible striking of the notes that are being tried, very sound knowledge of Indian music, striking the right note on the right time, and never missing a single bit of a beat, Talat conquered the souls of countless people throughout the globe, wherever Urdu and Hindi are spoken and understood. He is particularly and immensely popular among learned Urdu-speaking audiences having literary or artistic background, especially in Pakistan.

Talat was a member of the famous male singers' troika of the 1950s who had their respective separate fan-followings throughout the Indian subcontinent, the other two were ''[[Muhammad Rafi]]'' and ''[[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]]''.This famous troika was the most popular group of the film singers of the 1950s in the entire sub-continent, who enjoyed the largest audience ever existed during any period of sub-continent's cinematic history. Talat exerted a profound influence upon the ghazal singing of his time with his immensely melodious voice and artistic craftsmanship, particularly suitable for typically semi-classical ghazal singing. He was born to be a Ghazal singer, with his majestic style and brilliant diction he conquered not only the hearts of innumerable high-brow listeners but also common folks of his time. He was the heart-favorite singer of the older and maturer audience of his time, and this type of audience still listens to him more than any of the ghazal singers who ever sung except the Shahenshah-e-Ghazal ''[[Mehdi Hassan]]'' and ''[[Jagjit Singh]]''. So, in a sense, he still necessarily is a member of another troika, to be more precise, the three most influential ghazal singers of all time.

Talat particularly and profoundly influenced a whole generation of young singers who succeeded him; including legendary ghazal singers ''[[Jagjit Singh]]'' and ''[[Pankaj Udhas]]'' (who always honors him with the title of Shahenshah-E-Ghazal), singer ''[[Sajjad Ali]]'' and playback singer ''[[Abhijeet Bhattacharya]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Acting career ==
[[G. M. Durrani]] was a model to many playback singers who followed then. The soulful renditions of Durrani were to be reminded of by Talat's singing as well.

Besides being a gifted singer, Mahmood was quite handsome as well. He acted in over a dozen films with top actresses of the time like [[Nutan]], [[Mala Sinha]], [[Suraiya]] and others. Later he decided to give up acting to concentrate on singing.

Talat acted in the following [[Hindi films]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070304154450/http://www.talatmahmood.net/page3.htm Talat Mahmood 'Fact File']. talatmahmood.net &lt;/ref&gt;:

The advent of [[rock-n-roll]] in the late 1960s sidelined singers like Talat. As long as he was top box-office draw, the movie producers insisted on including his songs in their movies. Talat's velvety vocals posed a special challenge to the music-composers, most of whom leaned towards the deep baritones of [[Mohammad Rafi]] and [[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]]. The resultant demise of his movie career led to the decline of his singing career. At the same time, the social changes and happiness brought about by increasing prosperity in India meant that blue mood [[ghazals]] and heart-rending ballads were not popular any more. Talat continued to record good songs, but less in number. His last soundtrack recording, in 1985, is the song "Mere Shareek-e-Safar", a duet sung with Miss Hemlata, from the movie "Wali-e-Azam" composed by [[Chitragupt]] and written by [[Ahmed Wasi]].

However, Talat who was the first Indian singer to go on foreign concert tours in 1956 to East Africa found eager fans awaiting his arrival in other foreign countries. Jam packed audience in the United States, the UK, West Indies and other countries awaited his arrival enthusiastically. He performed in famous Royal Albert Hall in London, Madison Square Garden in the States and Jean Pierre Complex in the West Indies. He continued singing in the packed auditoriums until 1991 when he toured Holland. Talat sang about 800 songs in his long career. His songs are still popular among the music lovers as they were in the days these were released.

Talat married a Bengali Christian girl from Calcutta, who also acted in films and was a great fan of his, Latika Mullick, later named Nasreen on  20 February 1951 and had two children Khalid born in 1953 and Sabina born in 1959

== Personality ==
People, who were close to Talat, describe his nature as a quiet one. He is often remarked as a decent man, and his velvety and silky voice also reflected that decency and sense of calmness. Music directors, who worked with him, claimed that while listening to him, one would develop the feeling that Talat was a soft-hearted man. [[Dilip Kumar]] termed Talat as "a perfect gentleman". He was a fine gentleman who always had time and respect for his admirers.

'''''The Impossible''''' ({{lang-es|link=no|'''Lo Imposible'''}}) is a 2012 [[disaster film|disaster]] [[drama film]] directed by [[J. A. Bayona]] and written by [[Sergio G. Sánchez]]. It is based on the experience of [[María Belón]] and her family in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]. The cast includes [[Naomi Watts]], [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]].

The film received positive reviews from critics for its direction and its acting, especially for Watts who was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama]], and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role]].

==Plot==
Maria Bennett ([[Naomi Watts]]), her husband Henry ([[Ewan McGregor]]), and their three sons Lucas ([[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]]), Thomas ([[Samuel Joslin]]), and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) go on a Christmas holiday in 2004 to [[Khao Lak]], [[Thailand]]. Arriving on Christmas Eve, they settle in and begin to enjoy the brand new Orchid Beach Resort. Two days later on [[Boxing Day]], the massive [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]] inundates the area.

Maria and Lucas eventually emerge from the swirling water and find one another, with Maria having sustained serious injuries to her leg and chest. They help a young boy, Daniel, from the wreckage and are soon found by locals who transfer them to a local hospital in the city of [[Takua Pa]]. Daniel is separated from them during the journey. At the hospital, Maria encourages Lucas to help others find their family members while she goes into surgery for her chest injuries.

Meanwhile, Henry, Thomas and Simon have also survived and are together. Henry leaves the two boys with another family who head to the mountains for safe shelter while he stays behind to search for Maria and Lucas. While out looking, injured and alone, he is picked up by a passer-by and driven to a nearby bus shelter to wait out with other survivors. Communication facilities are scarce but eventually a tourist named Karl ([[Sönke Möhring]]), who has also been separated from his family, lends Henry his cell phone to contact his relatives. Henry promises Maria's father he will look everywhere for his family and that he will find them. Karl tells the group his wife had left him a note confirming they were at the beach, their location when the wave hit. He volunteers to accompany Henry to look for Maria and Lucas and his own family, too.

While Maria is in surgery, her medical chart is mixed-up with another patient who has died. Lucas returns to find his mother's bed empty and is then taken to a tent where children without families are kept safe. The mistake is discovered when Lucas cannot identify any of the dead woman's jewelry and he is subsequently reunited with his mother who has been moved to a private room in the [[Intensive Care Unit|ICU]]. In the hospital while he waits, Lucas finds Daniel who has been reunited with his father.

Henry and Karl search for their families in various places before they arrive at the hospital where Henry is given five minutes to look. Karl gives him a piece of paper with his family members’ names on. The vehicle carrying Thomas and Simon also stops outside the hospital and the boys get off so Simon can urinate. From a distance, Lucas recognizes his father and while searching him out in the chaotic crowd outside, Lucas' brothers spot him and they reunite. Henry finds the three of them together. He learns that Maria is in the hospital ready to undergo more surgery for her leg, which she survives. Flashbacks reveal how she came to be badly injured and how she surfaced the water. While in surgery, Lucas tells his father he has something really important to tell Maria.

The following day, the family boards an ambulance airplane to [[Singapore]] so Maria may receive further medical treatment, arranged by their insurance company. On the plane, Lucas tells his mother he knows Daniel is safe. Maria looks out the window at the chaos left behind.

==Production==
The film was a [[Co-production (filmmaking)|co-production]] of Spanish film companies Apaches Entertainment and [[Telecinco Cinema]], and employed much of the crew from ''[[The Orphanage (2007 film)|The Orphanage]]'', including the director, writer, production manager, cinematographer, composer, and editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ríos Pérez |first=Sergio |date=5 May 2010 |url=http://cineuropa.org/newsdetail.aspx?documentID=145048 |title=Álmodovar, Bayona make 'ambitious, high-quality European films from Spain' |work=Cineuropa.org |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Principal photography]] began 23 August 2010, in [[Alicante]], Spain, and continued in October in Thailand.&lt;ref name="EnglishDebut"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kay |first=Jeremy |date=2 May 2010 |url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/summit-boards-bayonas-english-language-debut-the-impossible/5013344.article |title=Summit boards Bayona's English-language debut The Impossible |work=ScreenDaily.com |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://screenbase.screendaily.com/films/816 |title=The Impossible |work=Screenbase |publisher=ScreenDaily.com |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director Juan Antonio Bayona decided not to specify the nationalities of the main characters in order to create a universal film in which nationalities were irrelevant to the plot.&lt;ref name="VeryAware"&gt;{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Courtney|date=13 December 2012|url=http://veryaware.com/2012/12/interview-naomi-watts-ewan-mcgregor-j-a-bayona-sergio-g-sanchez-belen-atienza-maria-belon-talk-the-impossible/|title=INTERVIEW: Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor, J.A.

The tsunami was recreated with a mixture of digital effects and real water surges filmed in slow motion created in a water tank in Spain using miniatures that were destroyed by a huge wave. Bayona committed to working with real water rather than a computer-generated wave because he wanted the story to be authentic. This meant Watts and Holland spent five weeks filming physically and psychologically demanding scenes in a massive water tank.&lt;ref name="BBC Impossible"&gt;{{cite news|last=Curtis|first=Rachel|title=Tsunami survivor's impossible story hits the big screen |publisher= [[BBC News]]|date=21 December 2012 | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20783441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holland, aged 14 at the time of filming, later described it as a "scary environment ...You can imagine how tiring and brutal that was."&lt;ref name="Scotsman Holland"&gt;{{cite news|last=Black|first=Claire|title=Schoolboy actor Tom Holland finds himself in Oscar contention for role in tsunami drama|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/film/schoolboy-actor-tom-holland-finds-himself-in-oscar-contention-for-role-in-tsunami-drama-1-2702253|accessdate=2 February 2013|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Impossible'' is the second collaboration between Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor after appearing together in the 2005 film ''[[Stay (2005 film)|Stay]]''.

==Release==
[[Warner Bros.]] released the film in Spain on 11 October 2012.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film an approval rating of 81% based on 188 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "The screenplay isn't quite as powerful as the direction or the acting, but with such an astonishing real-life story at its center, ''The Impossible'' is never less than compelling."&lt;ref name="RottenTomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_impossible_2012 |title=The Impossible (2012) |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher= [[Flixster]] |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted mean rating to reviews, the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating "generally favourable reviews."&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-impossible |title=The Impossible reviews |work=Metacritic |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave a perfect four-star rating, praising the performances of Watts and McGregor, and the direction of Bayona. He called it "one of the best films of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Impossible | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121219/REVIEWS/121219990/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Young of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave a very positive review, praising the performances of the two leading stars, stating that "Watts packs a huge charge of emotion as the battered, ever-weakening Maria whose tears of pain and fear never appear fake or idealised. McGregor, cut and streaked with excessive blood he seems too distraught to wash away, keeps the tension razor-sharp as he pursues his family in a vast, shattered landscape." About the film she added, "''The Impossible'' is one of the most emotionally realistic disaster movies in recent memory – and certainly one of the most frightening in its epic re-creation of the catastrophic 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami."&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite web |author=Young, Deborah |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/impossible-naomi-watts-ewan-mcgregor-369260 |title=The Impossible: Toronto Review |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=10 September 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine gave a positive review, praising Bayona's directing and Sánchez's writing: "Collaborating again after their impressive 2007 debut feature, ''[[The Orphanage (film)|The Orphanage]]'', Bayona and Sanchez get many things right here, starting with their decision to eschew a more panoramic view of the disaster to follow one family's journey from start to finish." About the performances of the main cast members he added, "Watts has few equals at conveying physical and emotional extremes, something she again demonstrates in a mostly bedridden role, and McGregor, in one of his better recent performances, manages to turn a simple phone call home into a small aria of heartbreak. Holland, in his live-action bigscreen debut, is wonderful as a kind, somewhat short-tempered kid who still has plenty to learn, setting the tone for similarly heartrending turns by young Joslin and Pendergast."&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite web |author=Chang, Justin |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117948281?refcatid=31 |title=The Impossible |work=Variety |publisher=Reed Elsevier Properties Inc |date=10 September 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damon Wise of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film four stars out of five. He also praised the performances, stating that "as Maria, Watts is both brave and vulnerable, and her scenes with the young Lucas (the excellent Tom Holland) are among the film's best, with adult and child now unexpected equals, the mother humbled, the son rising to the challenge. McGregor, meanwhile, gives one of his best performances as the sad and desperate Henry, trying to play the hero, the provider, while knowing his cause is almost certainly lost." About the film, he added: "Part of the appeal of this affecting and powerful drama is that it puts the viewer right in the moment at every stage, using authentic locations and tsunami survivors to hammer home the reality of this tragedy."&lt;ref name="Wise"&gt;{{cite web |author=Wise, Damon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/12/impossible-review |title=The Impossible |work=Guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date=12 September 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Kohn of ''[[IndieWire]]'' gave the film a "B-" grade and stated that the film "suffers from the greater problem of emphasising a feel-good plot within the context of mass destruction."&lt;ref name="Kohn"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kohn, Eric |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/toronto-review-juan-antonio-bayonas-the-impossible-is-an-intense-realization-of-the-2004-tsunami-at-odds-with-overstated-sentimentalism# |title=Toronto Review: Juan Antonio Bayona's 'The Impossible' Is an Intense Realisation of the 2004 Tsunami at Odds With Overstated Sentimentalism |work=IndieWire.com |publisher=A SnagFilms Co |date=9 September 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer [[A. O. Scott]], this narrowly-defined cinematic framing of the disaster through European and not Thai lenses represents "a troubling complacency and a lack of compassion in ''The Impossible''," a movie which he found to be "less an examination of mass destruction than the tale of a spoiled holiday."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=A.

===Response from victims===
Simon Jenkins, a British survivor from [[Portsmouth]], wrote to ''[[The Guardian]]'', stating the film is "beautifully accurate". This was in response to critics commenting that the film is "overdramatic" and "[[Whitewashing in film|whitewashed]]". He says of the comments, "As I must, I've never been the sort of person to revisit and analyse events of the past, but some of these articles frustrated me. Had this film been purely about the tale of a western middle class family's 'ruined' holiday then I would have agreed. For me, it was the exact opposite. Rather than concentrating on the 'privileged white visitors', the film portrayed the profound sense of community and unity that I experienced in Thailand, with this family at the centre of it. Both for my (then) 16-year-old self and the Belón family, it was the Thai people who waded through the settled water after the first wave had struck to help individuals and families... The Thai people had just lost everything – homes, businesses, families – yet their instinct was to help the tourists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jan/04/the-impossible-beautifully-accurate-film |title=The Impossible is 'beautifully accurate', writes tsunami survivor |publisher=theguardian.com |date=4 January 2013 |first=Simon |last=Jenkins |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support UK, a [[support group]] for survivors of the tsunami, lobbied to have the trailer screened with a warning notice beforehand. A spokesman for [[Odeon Cinemas]] stated that it had no control over the content of the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]]-approved trailer, saying, "We can only apologise for any offence caused on this occasion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2253133/Boxing-Day-Tsunami-Survivors-2004-tsunami-left-horrified-ambushed-trailer-movie-Boxing-Day-tragedy.html |title=Survivors of 2004 tsunami left horrified after being 'ambushed' by trailer for movie about Boxing Day tragedy |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=25 December 2012 |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2392">'''Forward Engagement''' is a term coined by [[Leon Fuerth]], former National Security Advisor to Vice President [[Al Gore]], to describe the process of thinking systematic about long-range issues in governance.  As a concept, Forward Engagement draws heavily on the fields of [[Futures Studies]] and [[Complex Systems]] Research. 

==Concept==
Forward Engagement asserts: (1) that major social change is accelerating at a rate fast enough to challenge the adaptive capacity of whole societies; (2) that governments ought to address such possibilities as far in advance as possible; and (3) that there needs to be a system to help governments visualize more consistently what may be approaching in order to deliberate sufficiently about responses. 

Further, Forward Engagement makes the proposition that there has been a shift in the nature of the major problems societies face: they increasingly interact with other problems, blur the lines between foreign and domestic, produce unplanned consequences, and mutate into new problems as parts of continuing processes. Such "complex" societal problems call for interdisciplinary and anticipatory approaches to problem solving.   

==Project==
Forward Engagement has been the subject of a project funded by [[the George Washington University]] and the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] and directed by Leon Fuerth since 2001.  The project recently examined three massive global contingencies—anthropogenic climate change, a geopolitical power-shift to Asia, and the attainment of means to rapidly and drastically alter human evolution through technology—through a series of working groups led by Fuerth, along with [[Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr.]], [[Philip Rubin]], and others.  Forward Engagement is additionally the subject of a graduate course at the [[Elliott School of International Affairs]].

'''Thomas Adamson''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1680), was an English master gunner in [[Charles II of England|King Charles II's]] train of artillery, notable for the 1680 publication of ''England's Defence, a Treatise concerning Invasion''.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite web  | last =Bullen | first =A. H. | title =Adamson, Thomas (fl. 1680), master gunner in King Charles II's train of artillery | work = [[Dictionary of National Biography]] Vol. I | publisher =Smith, Elder &amp; Co. | year =1885 | url =http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/olddnb.jsp?articleid=146 | accessdate = 2009-11-23 }} {{DNBfirst|wstitle=Adamson, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adamson's treatise was based on a work by [[Thomas Digges]], who had been Muster-Master-General to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth's]] forces in the [[Low Countries]]. Digges' treatise had been leaked to the [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]] shortly before the attempted [[Spanish Armada|Spanish invasion]] of England in 1588.

When the fear of a French invasion was imminent, Adamson, who hailed from Lancashire, edited this tract with additions of his own, giving an account of ‘such stores of war and other materials as are requisite for the defence of a fort, a train of artillery, and for a magazine belonging to a field army;..’ adding also a list: (1) of the ships of war, (2) of the governors of the garrisons of England, (3) of the lord-lieutenants and high sheriffs of the counties adjacent to the coasts; and concluding his tract by a statement of the wages paid per month to the officers and seamen in the fleet.

The [[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] notes that Adamson feared a French invasion would be supported by English Catholics and that he expressed the view that the people of England should take action against any such invasion - even to the point of deposing governors of garrisons should this be necessary. Adamson's work thus sailed close to advocating rebellion.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{cite web  | last =Porter | first =Stephen | title = Adamson, Thomas (fl. 1680), military writer | work = [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] | publisher =Oxford University Press | year =2004 | url =http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/146 | accessdate = 2009-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26110">{{About|the specific approach to quality management from the 1980s|quality management in general |Quality management}}
{{Manufacturing}}
'''Total quality management''' ('''TQM''') consists of organization-wide efforts to "install and make permanent a climate where employees [[Continual improvement process|continuously improve]] their ability to provide on demand products and services that customers will find of particular value."&lt;REF name="Ciampa"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ciampa | first1 = Dan | year = 1992 | title = Total Quality: A User's Guide for Implementation | location = [[Reading, Massachusetts]] | publisher = [[Addison-Wesley]] | page = xxii | isbn = 9780201549928 | oclc = 634190702}}&lt;/REF&gt;  "Total" emphasizes that departments in addition to production (for example sales and marketing, accounting and finance, engineering and design) are obligated to improve their operations; "management" emphasizes that executives are obligated to actively manage quality through funding, training, staffing, and goal setting.  While there is no widely agreed-upon approach, TQM efforts typically draw heavily on the previously developed tools and techniques of [[quality control]]. TQM enjoyed widespread attention during the late 1980s and early 1990s before being overshadowed by [[ISO 9000]], [[Lean manufacturing]], and [[Six Sigma]].

==History==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the developed countries of North America and Western Europe [[Early 1980s recession|suffered economically]] in the face of stiff competition from Japan's [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|ability to produce high-quality goods at competitive cost]]. For the first time since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the United Kingdom became a net importer of finished goods.  The United States undertook its own soul-searching, expressed most pointedly in the television broadcast of ''[[If Japan Can... Why Can't We?]]''  Firms began reexamining the techniques of [[quality control]] invented over the past 50 years and how those techniques had been so successfully employed by the Japanese. It was in the midst of this economic turmoil that TQM took root.

The exact origin of the term "total quality management" is uncertain.&lt;ref name="TTQMM"&gt;{{Citation | author = | last = Martínez-Lorente | first = Angel R. | last2 = Dewhurst | first2 = Frank |author3=Dale, Barrie G. | year = 1998 | title = Total Quality Management: Origins and Evolution of the Term | magazine = The TQM Magazine | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | publisher = [[Emerald Group Publishing|MCB University Publishers Ltd]] | publication-place = [[Bingley|Bingley, United Kingdom]] | pages = 378–386 | doi = 10.1108/09544789810231261 | url =  http://hdl.handle.net/10317/441}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is almost certainly inspired by [[Armand V. Feigenbaum]]'s multi-edition book ''Total Quality Control'' ({{OCLC|299383303}}) and [[Kaoru Ishikawa]]'s ''What Is Total Quality Control? The Japanese Way'' ({{OCLC|11467749}}).  It may have been first coined in the United Kingdom by the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] during its 1983 "National Quality Campaign".&lt;ref name="TTQMM"/&gt;  Or it may have been first coined in the United States by the [[Naval Air Systems Command]] to describe its quality-improvement efforts in 1985.&lt;ref name="TTQMM"/&gt;

===Development in the United States===
In the spring of 1984, an arm of the [[United States Navy]] asked some of its civilian researchers to assess [[statistical process control]] and the work of several prominent quality consultants and to make recommendations as to how to apply their approaches to improve the Navy's operational effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Houston"&gt;{{Citation | last = Houston | first = Archester | last2 = Dockstader | first2 = Steven L. | publication-date = | year = 1997 | title = Total Quality Leadership: A Primer | publisher = [[United States Navy]] | publication-place = [[Washington, D.C.]] | pages = 10–11 | id = 97-02 | oclc = 38886868 | url = http://www.balancedscorecard.org/portals/0/pdf/primer.pdf | accessdate = 2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recommendation was to adopt the teachings of [[W. Edwards Deming]].&lt;ref name="Houston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NavyHQ"&gt;{{Citation | last = McDaniel | first = Delora M. | last2 = Doherty | first2 = Linda M. |date=February 1990 | title = Total Quality Management Case Study in a Navy Headquarters Organization | publisher = [[Bureau of Naval Personnel|Navy Personnel Research and Development Center]] | publication-place = [[San Diego, California]] | page = 1 | id = NPRDC-TN-90-10 | oclc = 227755405 | url = http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA219412 | accessdate = 2013-10-20 | quote = Effective implementation of Total Quality Management (TQM) to improve quality and productivity is based upon the philosophy and management principles of W.

From the Navy, TQM spread throughout the US Federal Government, resulting in the following:
*The creation of the [[Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award]] in August 1987
*The creation of the Federal Quality Institute in June 1988
*The adoption of TQM by many elements of government and the armed forces, including the [[United States Department of Defense]],&lt;ref name="USDODGuide"&gt;{{Citation | author = [[United States Department of Defense]] | year = 1989 | title = Total Quality Management: A Guide for Implementation | publisher = [[National Technical Information Service]] | publication-place = [[Springfield, Virginia]] | id = DoD 5000.51-G | oclc = 21238720}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Army]],&lt;ref name="USArmy"&gt;{{Citation | publication-date = 1992-06-12 | title = Total Army Quality Management | publisher = [[United States Army]] | publication-place = [[Washington, D.C.]] | id = Army Regulation 5–1 | url = http://www.apd.army.mil/jw2/xmldemo/r5_1/cover.asp | accessdate = 2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United States Coast Guard]]&lt;ref name="USCGS"&gt;{{Citation | last = Nelson | first = Robert T. | publication-date = 1991-01-10 | title = COAST GUARD TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT (TQM) GENERIC ORGANIZATION | publisher = [[United States Coast Guard]] | publication-place = [[Washington, D.C.]] | id = COMDTINST 5224.7 | url = http://www.uscg.mil/directives/ci/5000-5999/CI_5224_7.pdf | accessdate = 2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Underground Storage Tanks program, which was established in 1985, also employed Total Quality Management to develop its management style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/602BCE06FAFAB29B.pdf#page=6|title=Transcript of ‘The Underground Storage Tank Program’s Early Management Challenges’ video|last=Brand|first=Ron|date=April 24, 2013|website=EPA Alumni Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The private sector followed suit, flocking to TQM principles not only as a means to recapture market share from the Japanese, but also to remain competitive when bidding for contracts from the Federal Government&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Creech | first = Bill | author-link = Wilbur L. Creech | year = 1994 | title = The Five Pillars of TQM: How to Make Total Quality Management Work for You | publisher = Truman Talley Books/Dutton | publication-place = [[New York City|New York]] | page = 153 | isbn = 9780525937258 | oclc = 28508067 | quote = ...the DOD took steps to extend its reach to the thousands of vendors who sell to the department...  Thus was born the DOD's TQM outreach program to all its vendors, large and small.  And the TQM banners went up all over America.}}&lt;/ref&gt; since "total quality" requires involving suppliers, not just employees, in process improvement efforts.

==Features==
There is no widespread agreement as to what TQM is and what actions it requires of organizations,&lt;ref name="Juran"&gt;{{Citation | last = Juran | first = Joseph M. | author-link = Joseph M. Juran | year = 1995 | title = A History of Managing for Quality: The Evolution, Trends, and Future Directions of Managing for Quality | publisher = [[American Society for Quality|ASQC Quality Press]] | publication-place = [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] | page = 596 | isbn = 9780873893411 | oclc = 32394752 | url = http://www.qualitydigest.com/dec/juran-2.html | accessdate = 2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{Citation | last = Holmes | first = Ken | date = 1992 | title = Total Quality Management | publisher = Pira International, Ltd. | publication-place = [[Leatherhead|Leatherhead, United Kingdom]] | page = 10 | isbn = 9781858020112 | oclc = 27644834 | quote = Ask ten people what TQM is and you will hear ten different answers. There is no specification or standard for it, or certification programme to proclaim that you have it. What we understand by TQM probably depends on which of the thought leaders, (often referred to as 'gurus') we have come across.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Creech | first = Bill | author-link = Wilbur L. Creech | year = 1994 | title = The Five Pillars of TQM: How to Make Total Quality Management Work for You | publisher = Truman Talley Books/Dutton | publication-place = [[New York City|New York]] | page = 4 | isbn = 9780525937258 | oclc = 28508067 | quote = In fact, the term TQM has become so widely used that it has become the number one buzzphrase to describe a new type of quality-oriented management.  Thus, the name TQM now covers a very broad tent encompassing all sorts of management practices.  In my management advisory activities I run into scores of these different programs all parading under the same name.  Few are alike, and those varied programs have a wide variety of features—a mixture of the old and the new—with, in more cases than not, very little of the new.  ...  However, I have forewarned you there are almost as many different TQM programs as there are companies that have started them because that creates confusion about what to do in your own case.}}&lt;/ref&gt; however a review of the original United States Navy effort gives a rough understanding of what is involved in TQM.

The key concepts in the TQM effort undertaken by the Navy in the 1980s include:&lt;ref name="ADA202154"&gt;{{Citation | last = Houston | first = Archester |date=December 1988 | title = A Total Quality Management Process Improvement Model | publisher = Navy Personnel Research and Development Center | publication-place = [[San Diego, California]] | pages = vii-viii | id = AD-A202 154 | oclc = 21243646 | url = http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a202154.pdf | accessdate = 2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Quality is defined by customers' requirements."
*"Top management has direct responsibility for quality improvement."
*"Increased quality comes from systematic analysis and improvement of work processes."
*"Quality improvement is a continuous effort and conducted throughout the organization."

The Navy used the following tools and techniques:
*The [[PDCA]] cycle to drive issues to resolution
*Ad hoc cross-functional teams (similar to [[quality circle]]s) responsible for addressing immediate process issues
*Standing cross-functional teams responsible for the improvement of processes over the long term
*Active management participation through steering committees
*Use of the [[Seven Basic Tools of Quality]] to analyze quality-related issues

===Notable definitions===
While there is no generally accepted definition of TQM, several notable organizations have attempted to define it.  These include:

====[[United States Department of Defense]] (1988)====
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;"Total Quality Management (TQM) in the Department of Defense is a strategy for continuously improving performance at every level, and in all areas of responsibility. It combines fundamental management techniques, existing improvement efforts, and specialized technical tools under a disciplined structure focused on continuously improving all processes. Improved performance is directed at satisfying such broad goals as cost, quality, schedule, and mission need and suitability. Increasing user satisfaction is the overriding objective. The TQM effort builds on the pioneering work of [[W. Edwards Deming|Dr. W. E. Deming]], [[Joseph M. Juran|Dr. J. M. Juran]], and others, and benefits from both private and public sector experience with continuous process improvement."&lt;ref name="USDODPlan"&gt;{{Citation |date=August 1988 | title = TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT MASTER PLAN | publisher = [[United States Department of Defense]] | publication-place = [[Washington, D.C.]] | page = 1 | id = ADA355612 | oclc = 831675799 | url = http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA355612 | accessdate = 2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

====[[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]] standard BS 7850-1:1992====
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;"A management philosophy and company practices that aim to harness the human and material resources of an organization in the most effective way to achieve the objectives of the organization."&lt;ref name="Hoyle"&gt;{{Citation | last = Hoyle | first = David | year = 2007 | title = Quality Management Essentials | publisher = [[Butterworth-Heinemann]] | publication-place = [[Oxford|Oxford, United Kingdom]] | page = 200 | isbn = 9780750667869 | oclc = 72868446 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=o25pOeY9_CQC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200 | accessdate = 2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

====[[International Organization for Standardization]] standard ISO 8402:1994====
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;"A management approach of an organisation centred on quality, based on the participation of all its members and aiming at long term success through customer satisfaction and benefits to all members of the organisation and society."&lt;ref name="Pfeifer"&gt;{{Citation | last = Pfeifer | first = Tilo | year = 2002 | title = Quality Management: Strategies, Methods, Techniques | publisher = [[Carl Hanser Verlag]] | publication-place = [[Munich|Munich, Germany]] | page = 5 | isbn = 9783446220034 | oclc = 76435823 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=C5s1pqsQgWMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA5 | accessdate = 2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

====The [[American Society for Quality]]====
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;"A term first used to describe a management approach to quality improvement. Since then, TQM has taken on many meanings. Simply put, it is a management approach to long-term success through customer satisfaction. TQM is based on all members of an organization participating in improving processes, products, services and the culture in which they work.

===Standards===
During the 1990s, standards bodies in Belgium, France, Germany, Turkey, and the United Kingdom attempted to standardize TQM.  While many of these standards have since been explicitly withdrawn, they all are effectively superseded by [[ISO 9000]]:

==Legacy==
Interest in TQM as an academic subject peaked around 1993.&lt;ref name="TTQMM"/&gt;

The Federal Quality Institute was shuttered in September 1995 as part of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]]'s efforts to [[National Partnership for Reinventing Government#Impact of the National Performance Review|streamline government]].&lt;ref name="QualityDigest"&gt;{{Citation | last = Dusharme | first = Dirk |date=August 1995 | title = Federal Quality Institute Set to Close | magazine = Quality Digest | publisher = QCI International | publication-place = [[Red Bluff, California]] | issn = 1049-8699 | oclc = 17469778 | url = http://www.qualitydigest.com/aug95/newsdig.html#anchor558722 | accessdate = 2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The European Centre for Total Quality Management closed in August 2009, a casualty of the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref name="Bradford"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.brad.ac.uk/acad/management/external/page.php?section=homenew&amp;page=ectqm | title = European Centre for Total Quality Management | website = www.brad.ac.uk | publisher = [[University of Bradford]] | location = [[Bradford|Bradford, United Kingdom]] | accessdate = 2013-10-19 | quote = The European Centre for TQM has ceased to exist as from the end of August 2009. For all information related to ECTQM and its activities, please contact Professor [[Mohamed Zairi]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TQM as a vaguely defined quality management approach was largely supplanted by the [[ISO 9000]] collection of standards and their formal certification processes in the 1990s.  Business interest in quality improvement under the TQM name also faded as [[Jack Welch]]'s success attracted attention to [[Six Sigma]] and [[Toyota]]'s success attracted attention to [[Lean manufacturing]], though the three share many of the same tools, techniques, and significant portions of the same philosophy.

TQM lives on in various [[List of national quality awards|national quality awards]] around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vokurka | first1 = Robert J | last2 = Stading | first2 = Gary L | last3 = Brazeal | first3 = Jason | title = A Comparative Analysis of National and Regional Quality Awards | url = http://asq.org/qic/display-item/?item=13968 | journal = Quality Progress | location = [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] | publisher = [[American Society for Quality]] | publication-date = August 2000 | volume = 33 | issue = 8 | pages = 41 | issn = 0033-524X | accessdate = 2014-05-05 | archiveurl = http://www.forms.texas-quality.org/SiteImages/125/Reference%20Library/Comparing%20Quality%20Awards.pdf | archivedate = unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The social scientist Bettina Warzecha (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Bettina, Warzecha, (2017). [https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/992993108 ''Problem with Quality Management Process orientation, controllability and zero-defect processes as modern myths'']. Walsrode. {{ISBN|9783981863833}}. {{OCLC|992993108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the central concepts of Quality Management (QM), such as e.g. process orientation, controllability, and zero defects as modern myths. She demonstrates that zero-error processes and the associated illusion of controllability involve the epistemological problem of self-referentiality. The emphasis on the processes in QM also ignores the artificiality and thus arbitrariness of the difference between structure and process. Above all, the complexity of management cannot be reduced to standardized (mathematical) procedures. According to her, the risks and negative side effects of QM are usually greater than the benefits (see also ''brand eins'', 2010).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brandeins.de/archiv/2010/qualitaet/ungesunde-ordnung/ "Ungesunde Ordnung - brand eins online"].

It is often translated as "I am because we are," and also "humanity towards others", but is often used in a more philosophical sense to mean "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity".&lt;ref name="aboutthename"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/about-ubuntu/C/about-ubuntu-name.html |title=About the Name |work=Official Ubuntu Documentation |publisher=Canonical |accessdate=2 February 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223104643/https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/about-ubuntu/C/about-ubuntu-name.html |archivedate=23 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Southern Africa]], it has come to be used as a term for a kind of [[humanism|humanist]] philosophy, ethic, or ideology, also known as ''Ubuntuism'' propagated in the [[Africanization|Africanisation]] (transition to majority rule) process of these countries during the 1980s and 1990s.

Since the transition to democracy in South Africa with the [[Nelson Mandela]] presidency [[South African general election, 1994|in 1994]], the term has become more widely known outside of Southern Africa, notably popularised to English-language readers through the [[ubuntu theology]] of [[Desmond Tutu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-meaning-of-ubuntu-43307|title=Get the Definition of Ubuntu, a Nguni Word with Several Meanings|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tutu was the chairman of the South African [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), and many have argued that ''ubuntu'' was a formative influence on the TRC. However, this view is challenged and contextualized by Christian B. N. Gade in ''A Discourse on African Philosophy: A New Perspective on Ubuntu and Transitional Justice in South Africa''. One of Gade's key findings is that former TRC commissioners and committee members question the importance of ''ubuntu'' in the TRC process{{who?|date=November 2017}}. Another is that there are several differing and historically developing interpretations of ''ubuntu'', some of which have evident political implications and reflect non-factual and creative uses of history.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==History of the concept==
The term ''ubuntu'' appears in South African sources from as early as the mid-19th century. Reported translations covered the [[semantic field]] of "human nature, humanness, humanity; virtue, goodness, kindness". Grammatically, the word combines the root ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Bantu/mʊ̀ntʊ̀|-ntʊ̀]]'' "person, human being" with the [[Zulu grammar#Nouns|class 14]] ''[[:wikt:ubu-|ubu-]]'' prefix forming [[abstract noun]]s,&lt;ref&gt;see also [[:wikt:Appendix:Zulu nouns#Noun classes|Zulu noun classes]] on [[Wiktionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; so that the term is exactly parallel in formation to the abstract noun ''[[:wikt:humanity|humanity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;in the sense of an abstract quality. The sense "mankind" is taken by the class 7 collective noun ''[[:wikt:isintu|isintu]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was popularised in terms of a "[[philosophy]]" or "[[world view]]" (as opposed to a quality attributed to an individual) beginning in the 1950s, notably in the writings of [[Jordan Kush Ngubane]]  published in the ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|African Drum]]'' magazine.
From the 1970s, the ''ubuntu'' began to be described as a specific kind of "African humanism". Based on the context of [[Pan-Africanism|Africanisation]] propagated by the political thinkers in the 1960s period of [[decolonization|decolonisation]], 
''ubuntu'' was used as a term for a specifically African (or Southern African) kind of  humanism found in the context of the transition to black majority rule in [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]].
The first publication dedicated to ''ubuntu'' as a philosophical concept appeared in 1980, ''Hunhuism or Ubuntuism: A Zimbabwe Indigenous Political Philosophy'' (''hunhu'' being the [[Shona languages|Shona]] equivalent of Nguni ''ubuntu'') by [[Stanlake J. W. T. Samkange]]. Hunhuism or Ubuntuism is presented as political ideology for the new Zimbabwe, as [[Southern Rhodesia]] was granted independence from the United Kingdom. 

From Zimbabwe, the concept was taken over in South Africa in the 1990s as a guiding ideal for the [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|transition from apartheid to majority rule]].
The term appears in the Epilogue of the Interim Constitution of South Africa (1993), "there is a need for understanding but not for vengeance, a need for reparation but not for retaliation, a need for ''ubuntu'' but not for victimisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Christian B. N. Gade|url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/40165256/The_Historical_Development_of_the_Written_Discourses_on_Ubuntu.pdf |title=The Historical Development of the Written Discourses on Ubuntu|journal=South African Journal of Philosophy|volume= 30|issue=3|pages= 303–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Image:Experience ubuntu.ogg|thumb|300px|[[Nelson Mandela]] in 2006 was asked to define "ubuntu" in a video used to launch [[Ubuntu Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;Interviewed by [[Tim Modise]], copyright by [[Canonical Ltd.]]--transcription: "In the old days, when we were young, a traveler through the country would stop at a village, and he didn't have to ask for food or for water; once he stops, the people give him food, entertain him. That is one aspect of ubuntu, but it will have various aspects."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

There are many different, and not always compatible, definitions of what ubuntu is (for a survey of how ubuntu is defined among South Africans see Gade 2012: "What is Ubuntu? Different Interpretations among South Africans of African Descent"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Christian B. N. Gade|year= 2012|url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/48387009/What_is_Ubuntu._Different_Interpretations_among_South_Africans_of_African_Descent.pdf |title=What is Ubuntu? Different Interpretations among South Africans of African Descent|journal=South African Journal of Philosophy|volume= 31|issue=3|pages= 484–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 
Ubuntu asserts that society, not a transcendent being, gives human beings their humanity. An example is a [[Zulu language|Zulu]]-speaking person who when commanding to speak in Zulu would say “''khuluma isintu'',” which means "speak the language of people". When someone behaves according to custom, a [[Sotho language|Sotho]]-speaking person would say “''ke motho'',” which means "he/she is a human". The exclusionary and abhorrent aspect of this would be exemplified by a tale told (often, in private quarters) in [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] “''kushone abantu ababili ne Shangaan''”, in [[Sepedi]] “''go tlhokofetje batho ba babedi le leShangane''”, in English (two people died and one [[Shangaan]]). In each of these examples, humanity comes from conforming to or being part of the tribe.

According to Michael Onyebuchi Eze, the core of ubuntu can best be summarised as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'A person is a person through other people' strikes an affirmation of one’s humanity through recognition of an ‘other’ in his or her uniqueness and difference. It is a demand for a creative intersubjective formation in which the ‘other’ becomes a mirror (but only a mirror) for my subjectivity. This idealism suggests to us that humanity is not embedded in my person solely as an individual; my humanity is co-substantively bestowed upon the other and me. Humanity is a quality we owe to each other. We create each other and need to sustain this otherness creation. And if we belong to each other, we participate in our creations: we are because you are, and since you are, definitely I am. The ‘I am’ is not a rigid subject, but a dynamic self-constitution dependent on this otherness creation of relation and distance.&lt;ref&gt;Eze, M. O. ''Intellectual History in Contemporary South Africa'', pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An "extroverted communities" aspect is the most visible part of this ideology. There is sincere warmth with which people treat both strangers and members of the community. This overt display of warmth is not merely aesthetic but enables formation of spontaneous communities. The resultant collaborative work within these spontaneous communities transcends the aesthetic and gives functional significance to the value of warmth. How else are you to ask for sugar from your neighbour? Warmth is not the sine qua non of community formation but guards against instrumentalist relationships. Unfortunately, sincere warmth may leave one vulnerable to those with ulterior motives.&lt;ref name="GriggsLouw1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lewis Griggs|author2=Lente-Louise Louw|title=Valuing Diversity: New Tools for a New Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZubtAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-024778-9|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ubuntu" as political philosophy has aspects of [[socialism]], propagating the redistribution of wealth. This is similar to redistributive policies in liberalism. This socialisation is a vestige of agrarian peoples as a hedge against the crop failures of individuals. Socialisation presupposes a community population with which individuals empathise and concomitantly, have a vested interest in its collective prosperity. Urbanisation and the aggregation of people into an abstract and bureaucratic state undermines this empathy. African Intellectual historians like Michael Onyebuchi Eze have argued however that this ideal of "collective responsibility" must not be understood as absolute in which the community's good is prior to the individual's good.  On this view, ubuntu it is argued, is a communitarian philosophy that is widely differentiated from the Western notion of communitarian socialism. In fact, ubuntu induces an ideal of shared human subjectivity that promotes a community's good through an unconditional recognition and appreciation of individual uniqueness and difference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eze, M. O.|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/sajpem/article/viewFile/31526/5888|title=What is African Comunitarianism? Against consensus as a regulative Ideal|year=2008|journal= South African Journal of Philosophy|volume= 27|issue=4|pages= 386–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Audrey Tang]] has suggested that Ubuntu "implies that everyone has different skills and strengths; people are not isolated, and through mutual support they can help each other to complete themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-source-enlightenment-2015-part-1-audrey-tang|title=Open Source Enlightenment 2015 (Part 1)|author=Audrey Tang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Redemption" relates to how people deal with errant, deviant and dissident members of the community. The belief is that man is born formless like a lump of clay. It is up to the community, as a whole, to use the fire of experience and the wheel of social control to mould him into a pot that may be of general use. Any imperfections should be borne by the community and the community should always seek to redeem man. An example of this is the statement by the [[African National Congress]] (in South Africa) that it does not throw out its own but rather redeems. A possible limitation of this is that not all clay is the same and not all tools are pots or of general use. Likewise, not all people are the same or similar, and not all people are fated to have the same or similar function.

==Zimbabwe==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
In the [[Shona language|Shona]] language, the majority spoken language in [[Zimbabwe]], ubuntu is ''unhu''. The concept of ubuntu is viewed the same in Zimbabwe as in other African cultures, and the Zulu saying is also common in Shona: ''munhu munhu nekuda kwevanhu''.

[[Stanlake J. W. T. Samkange]] (1980) highlights the three maxims of Hunhuism or Ubuntuism that shape this philosophy: The first maxim asserts that 'To be human is to affirm one's humanity by recognizing the humanity of others and, on that basis, establish respectful human relations with them.' And 'the second maxim means that if and when one is faced with a decisive choice between wealth and the preservation of the life of another human being, then one should opt for the preservation of life'.  The third 'maxim' as a 'principle deeply embedded in traditional African political philosophy' says 'that the king owed his status, including all the powers associated with it, to the will of the people under him'.

While sharing is incorporated within "unhu", it is only one of the multiplicity of virtues within "unhu". In the "unhu" domain, visitors do not need to burden themselves with carrying provisions – all they need is to dress properly and be on the road. All visitors are provided for and protected in every home they pass through without payment being expected. In fact, every individual should try his or her best to make visitors comfortable – and this applies to everyone who is aware of the presence of a visitor within a locality.

Other manifestations of ubuntu are that it is taboo to call elderly people by their given names; instead they are called by their surnames. This has the effect of banishing individualism and replacing it with a representative role, in which the individual effectively stands for the people among whom he comes from at all times. The individual identity is replaced with the larger societal identity within the individual. Thus, families are portrayed or reflected in the individual and this phenomenon is extended to villages, districts, provinces and regions being portrayed in the individual. This places high demands on the individual to behave in the highest standards and to portray the highest possible virtues that society strives for. "Unhu" embodies all the invaluable virtues that society strives for towards maintaining harmony and the spirit of sharing among its members.

A key concept associated with "unhu" is how we behave and interact in our various social roles, e.g., daughters-in-law traditionally kneel down when greeting their parents-in-law and serve them food as a sign of respect and maintain the highest standards of behaviour that will be extended or reflected to her family and all the women raised in that family. The daughter-in-law does this as part of the ambassadorial function that she plays and assumes at all times. However, this does not apply only to daughters-in-law but to all women in general, even among friends and equals such as brother and sister.

Under "unhu" children are never orphans since the roles of mother and father are by definition not vested in a single individual with respect to a single child. Furthermore, a man or a woman with "unhu" will never allow any child around them to be an orphan.

The concept of "unhu" also constitutes the kernel of [[African Traditional Jurisprudence]] as well as leadership and governance.  In the concept of unhu, a crime committed by one individual on another extends far beyond the two individuals and has far-reaching implications to the people from among whom the perpetrator of the crime comes. Unhu jurisprudence tends to support remedies and punishments that tend to bring people together. For instance, a crime of murder would lead to the creation of a bond of marriage between the victim's family and the accused's family in addition to the perpetrator being punished both inside and outside his social circles. The role of "tertiary perpetrator" to the murder crime is extended to the family and the society where the individual perpetrator hails from. However, the punishment of the tertiary perpetrator is a huge fine and a social stigma, which they must shake off after many years of demonstrating ''unhu'' or ''ubuntu''. A leader who has ''unhu'' is selfless and consults widely and listens to subjects. Such a person does not adopt a lifestyle that is different from the subjects, but lives among them and shares property. A leader who has "unhu" does not lead, but allows the people to lead themselves and cannot impose his will on his people, which is incompatible with "unhu".

{{quote| Ubuntu is recognised as being an important source of law within the context of strained or broken relationships amongst individuals or communities and as an aid for providing remedies which contribute towards more mutually acceptable remedies for the parties in such cases. Ubuntu is a concept which:

# is to be contrasted with vengeance;
# dictates that a high value be placed on the life of a human being;
# is inextricably linked to the values of and which places a high premium on dignity, compassion, humaneness and respect for humanity of another;
# dictates a shift from confrontation to mediation and conciliation;
# dictates good attitudes and shared concern;
# favours the re-establishment of harmony in the relationship between parties and that such harmony should restore the dignity of the plaintiff without ruining the defendant;
# favours restorative rather than retributive justice;
# operates in a direction favouring reconciliation rather than estrangement of disputants;
# works towards sensitising a disputant or a defendant in litigation to the hurtful impact of his actions to the other party and towards changing such conduct rather than merely punishing the disputant;
# promotes mutual understanding rather than punishment;
# favours face-to-face encounters of disputants with a view to facilitating differences being resolved rather than conflict and victory for the most powerful;
# favours civility and civilised dialogue premised on mutual tolerance.}}


At [[Nelson Mandela]]'s memorial, United States President [[Barack Obama]] spoke about Ubuntu, saying,

{{quote|
There is a word in South Africa – Ubuntu – a word that captures Mandela’s greatest gift:  his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us.

We can never know how much of this sense was innate in him, or how much was shaped in a dark and solitary cell.  But we remember the gestures, large and small – introducing his jailers as honored guests at his inauguration; taking a pitch in a Springbok uniform; turning his family’s heartbreak into a call to confront HIV/AIDS – that revealed the depth of his empathy and his understanding.  He not only embodied Ubuntu, he taught millions to find that truth within themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-nelson-mandela-memorial-service-speech-full-text-2013-12|title=Obama's Tribute To Nelson Mandela At Memorial Service - Business Insider|date=10 December 2013|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Malawi==
{{refimprove|date=July 2013}}
In [[Malawi]], the same philosophy is called "uMunthu".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/67211|title=Pambazuka - Teaching uMunthu for global peace|work=pambazuka.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to the Catholic Diocese of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zomba|Zomba]] bishop Rt. Rev. Fr. [[Thomas Msusa]], “The African worldview is about living as one family, belonging to God”.&lt;ref name="freireproject.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freireproject.org/content/umunthu-peace-and-education-malawi%E2%80%99s-44th-independence-anniversary |title=uMunthu, Peace and Education: On Malawi’s 44th Independence Anniversary|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722234550/http://www.freireproject.org/content/umunthu-peace-and-education-malawi%E2%80%99s-44th-independence-anniversary|archivedate=22 July 2012|author=Steve Sharra|year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Msusa noted that in Africa “We say ‘I am because we are’, or in [[Chichewa]] ''kali kokha nkanyama, tili awiri ntiwanthu'' (when you are on your own you are as good as an animal of the wild; when there are two of you, you form a community).”

The philosophy of uMunthu has been passed on through proverbs such as ''Mwana wa mnzako ngwako yemwe, ukachenjera manja udya naye'' (your neighbor's child is your own, his/her success is your success too).&lt;ref name="freireproject.org"/&gt; Some notable Malawian uMunthu philosophers and intellectuals who have written about this worldview are [[Augustine Musopole]], [[Gerard Chigona]], [[Chiwoza Bandawe]], [[Richard Tambulasi]], [[Harvey Kwiyani]] and [[Happy Kayuni]]. This includes Malawian philosopher and theologist [[Harvey Sindima]]’s treatment of uMunthu as an important African philosophy is highlighted in his 1995 book ‘Africa’s Agenda: The legacy of liberalism and colonialism in the crisis of African values’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2327 Community of Life: Ecological Theology in African Perspective.]&lt;/ref&gt;
In film, the English translation of the proverb lent its hand to forming the title of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s documentary, ''[[I Am Because We Are]]'' about Malawian orphans.

=="Ubuntu Diplomacy"==
In June 2009, in her swearing-in remarks as [[U.S. Department of State|US Department of State]] Special Representative for Global Partnerships, Global Partnership Initiative, Office of the Secretary of State (served 18 June 2009 – 10 October 2010), [[Elizabeth Frawley Bagley]] discussed ubuntu in the context of American [[foreign policy]], stating:  "In understanding the responsibilities that come with our interconnectedness, we realize that we must rely on each other to lift our World from where it is now to where we want it to be in our lifetime, while casting aside our worn out preconceptions, and our outdated modes of statecraft." She then introduced the notion of "Ubuntu Diplomacy" with the following words:

{{quote|In 21st-century diplomacy, the Department of State will be a convener, bringing people together from across regions and sectors to work together on issues of common interest. Our work no longer depends on the least common denominator; but rather, we will seek the highest possible multiplier effect for the results we can achieve together.

We will also act as a catalyst, with our Foreign Service Officers launching new projects in tandem with those NGOs, philanthropies, and corporations at the front lines of foreign affairs to discover untapped potential, inspire fresh ideas, and create new solutions.

And we will act as a collaborator, leading interagency coordination here in Washington and cross-sector collaboration in the field, with our Ambassadors working closely with our non-governmental partners to plan and implement projects for maximum impact and sustainability.

In the same way that [[Hillary Clinton|Secretary Clinton]] has often said that ‘it takes a village to raise a child,’ we are now realizing that we must apply a similar approach worldwide. It takes a shared, global response to meet the shared, global challenges we face. This is the truth taught to us in an old South African principle, ubuntu, or ‘A person is a person through other persons.’ As Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] describes this perspective, ubuntu ‘is not, “I think therefore I am.” It says rather: “I am a human because I belong. I participate. I share.”’ In essence, I am because you are.

We are truly all in this together, and we will only succeed by building mutually beneficial partnerships among civil society, the private sector, and the public sector, in order to empower the men and women executing our foreign policy to advance their work through partnerships.

The truth and reconciliation council believed in the philosophy of Ubuntu because they believed that Ubuntu was going to help to reform and reconnect the already broken country of South Africa.

This is Ubuntu Diplomacy: where all sectors belong as partners, where we all participate as stakeholders, and where we all succeed together, not incrementally but exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State. [https://www.state.gov/s/partnerships/ubuntu/index.htm Ubuntu Diplomacy.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the [[Earth Summit 2002|2002 UN World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD), there was an Ubuntu Village exposition centre.&lt;ref&gt;World Resources Institute. "The Success and Failures of Johannesburn: A Story of Many Summits".

In October 2004 [[Mark Shuttleworth]], a South African entrepreneur and owner of UK based company [[Canonical Ltd.]], founded the Ubuntu Foundation that is the company behind the creation of a computer operating system based on [[Debian]] [[Linux]].  He named the Linux distribution [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]].&lt;ref name="aboutthename"/&gt;

The '''Webster Sycamore''' (alternatively known as the '''Webster Springs Sycamore''' and the '''Big Sycamore Tree''') was an [[Platanus occidentalis|American sycamore]] (''Platanus occidentalis'') in the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]]. Long recognized for its size, the Webster Sycamore was the largest living American sycamore tree in West Virginia until its [[felling]] in 2010. The tree stood approximately {{convert|4.5|mi|km}} east of [[Webster Springs, West Virginia|Webster Springs]] in [[Webster County, West Virginia|Webster County]], in a moist flood plain along the banks of the Back Fork Elk River, a tributary stream of the [[Elk River (West Virginia)|Elk River]].

The Webster Sycamore reached a [[tree height measurement]] of {{convert|112|ft|m}}, a [[tree crown measurement]] of {{convert|90|ft|m}}, and a circumference of {{convert|25.75|ft|m}} at [[diameter at breast height|breast height]]. In 1955, the [[American Forests|American Forests Association]] declared the tree the largest of its species in the United States. It only held the title for three weeks, before the association identified a larger American sycamore in [[Maryland]]. Despite losing its national title, the sycamore remained the largest American sycamore in West Virginia. Following a 1963 survey of large trees in West Virginia, the Webster Sycamore was named the second-largest tree after a [[white oak]] (''Quercus alba'') in [[Randolph County, West Virginia|Randolph County]].

The land upon which the Webster Sycamore was located was owned by the Pardee and Curtin Lumber Company, which spared the tree during its [[lumber]] operations in the area during the 1950s. [[West Virginia University]] biologist W.&amp;nbsp;H. Gillespie averred that the tree stood as "a memorial of the original virgin forest". The Pardee and Curtin Lumber Company preserved the land surrounding the tree as a park, known as Big Sycamore Park. During the annual events Webster Wildwater Weekend in April and the Webster County Nature Weekend in May, hiking excursions were led to the Webster Sycamore.

On September 3, 2007, a malicious fire was set in the base of the Webster Sycamore's trunk. The tree survived the blaze, but suffered irreparable damage. The [[West Virginia Division of Forestry]] performed a safety and risk assessment of the tree, and determined that structural mitigation was not feasible, and that the Webster Sycamore was to be "considered an extreme hazard". In January 2008, a 17-year-old suspect from [[Bergoo, West Virginia|Bergoo]] was formally charged with a [[felony]] count of [[arson]] for setting fire to the tree. Following the fire, experts recommended that the Webster Sycamore be felled or fenced off as a safety measure. According to the Division of Forestry, the tree was finally brought down during the summer of 2010. At the time of its death, the tree was estimated to be over 500 years old.

Formerly West Virginia's largest American sycamore, the Webster Sycamore (alternatively known as the Webster Springs Sycamore and the Big Sycamore Tree) was located in a moist flood plain along the banks of the [[Back Fork Elk River]], a tributary stream of the [[Elk River (West Virginia)|Elk River]], in [[Webster County, West Virginia|Webster County]].&lt;ref name="TCG1"&gt;{{cite news| title =Authorities investigate arson at landmark tree| newspaper =[[Charleston Gazette-Mail|The Charleston Gazette]]| publication-place =[[Charleston, West Virginia]]| date =September 4, 2007| url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13966166.html| accessdate =October 5, 2015| via =[[HighBeam Research]]| subscription =yes| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160419111739/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13966166.html| archivedate =April 19, 2016| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDM3"&gt;{{cite news| title =Community briefs| newspaper =[[Charleston Daily Mail]]| publication-place =[[Charleston, West Virginia]]| date =April 23, 2008| url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-16306536.html| accessdate =October 5, 2015| subscription =yes| via =[[HighBeam Research]]| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20171216173434/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-16306536.html| archivedate =December 16, 2017| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gillespie1"&gt;{{Harvnb| Gillespie |1955|p=72.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree was located approximately {{convert|4.5|mi|km}} east of [[Webster Springs, West Virginia|Webster Springs]].&lt;ref name = "Hannah1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hannah|Brashears|2007|p=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDM1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Charlotte Ferrell | title = Teen charged with burning historic tree | newspaper = [[Charleston Daily Mail]] | publication-place = [[Charleston, West Virginia]] | date = January 15, 2008 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-15106985.html | accessdate = October 5, 2015 | subscription = yes | via = [[HighBeam Research]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171216173433/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-15106985.html | archivedate = December 16, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dimensions, age, and recognition ==

=== Dimensions and age ===
Various measurements were taken of the tree during the latter part of its lifetime; however, measurements of the [[circumference]] differ. In 1955, the tree's circumference at [[Diameter at breast height|breast height]], when measured {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} from the ground, was {{convert|24|ft|8|in|m}}.&lt;ref name = "Gillespie2"&gt;{{Harvnb| Gillespie |1955|p=73.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a [[tree fork]] {{convert|45|ft|m}} from the ground, its trunk measured {{convert|4.33|ft|m}} in diameter.&lt;ref name = "Gillespie2"/&gt; The trunk stood to a height of {{convert|82|ft|m}}, where it had been decapitated by a previous windstorm.&lt;ref name = "Gillespie2"/&gt; The tree's horizontal canopy spread measured approximately {{convert|75|ft|m}} in width.&lt;ref name = "Gillespie2"/&gt; The lowest limb of the sycamore was {{convert|23.5|ft|m}} from the ground, and measured {{convert|2|ft|m}} in diameter.&lt;ref name = "Gillespie2"/&gt; According to official measurements in 1963, however, the diameter at breast height of the Webster Sycamore, when measured {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} from the ground, was more than {{convert|7|ft|m}} and its circumference measured {{convert|23|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="SGM1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Blizzard | first = William C. | title = Big Sycamore on Back Elk: Webster giant carries piggy-back partner. | newspaper = [[Charleston Gazette-Mail|Sunday Gazette-Mail]] | publication-place = [[Charleston, West Virginia]] | date = May 17, 1964 | page = 20m | url = https://www.newspapers.com/image/40541598/ | accessdate = October 5, 2015 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306080459/http://www.newspapers.com/image/40541598/ | archivedate = March 6, 2016 | df = mdy-all }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sycamore was estimated to be at least {{convert|120|ft|m}} in height.&lt;ref name = "SGM1"/&gt; Its trunk measured approximately {{convert|5|ft|m}} in diameter when measured {{convert|90|ft|m}} from the forest floor.&lt;ref name = "SGM1"/&gt;

According to the West Virginia Division of Forestry and West Virginia Humanities Council in 2002 and the West Virginia Big Tree Program in 2011, the Webster Sycamore was the largest American sycamore in West Virginia, with a height of {{convert|112|ft|m}}, a [[tree crown measurement]] of {{convert|90|ft|m}}, and a circumference of {{convert|25.75|ft|m}} at breast height.&lt;ref name="CDM4"&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Charlotte Ferrell | title = Officials want to update W.Va.

By the time of its felling in 2010, the Webster Sycamore was estimated to be over 500 years in age.&lt;ref name = "TCG1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CDM4"/&gt;

=== Other physical characteristics ===
In 1955, an [[Tsuga canadensis|eastern hemlock]] (''Tsuga canadensis'') measuring {{convert|5.5|ft|m}} in height grew from a rotten [[Wood#Knots|knothole]] in the tree's main south fork.&lt;ref name = "Gillespie2"/&gt; By 1963, the hemlock that had taken root in the tree's south fork remained.&lt;ref name = "SGM1"/&gt; In describing the growth of the hemlock from an upper tree fork of the Webster Sycamore, writer William C. Blizzard referenced the idiom of [[Pelion]] piled upon [[Mount Ossa (Greece)|Ossa]].&lt;ref name = "SGM1"/&gt; No [[tree hollow]]s or visible outer blemishes were reported on the sycamore at that time; however, by 2007, the tree's trunk had developed an opening into its hollow center at its base, which allowed visitors to step inside of it.&lt;ref name = "TCG1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "SGM1"/&gt;

=== Recognition ===
[[File:Webster Sycamore Webster Springs WV 1920.jpg|upright|right|thumb|alt=A black and white image of an American sycamore, possibly the Webster Sycamore, taken around 1920 | An image of an American sycamore near Webster Springs published in ''Trees, Stars and Birds: A Book of Outdoor Science'' (1920)]]
The Webster Sycamore had long been a local landmark on account of its age and size, and was known locally as being the world's largest American sycamore.&lt;ref name = "Gillespie1"/&gt; By 1920, author Edwin Lincoln Mosely had included an image and a brief description of a similar American sycamore near Webster Springs&amp;nbsp;– probably the Webster Sycamore&amp;nbsp;– in his book ''Trees, Stars and Birds: A Book of Outdoor Science''.&lt;ref name = "Mosely1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mosely|1920|p=x.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in 1955 that the tree won recognition from the [[American Forests|American Forests Association]] as the largest tree of its species in the United States.&lt;ref name = "Gillespie1"/&gt; It only held the title for three weeks before a larger American sycamore in Maryland was discovered and recognized by the association.&lt;ref name = "Gillespie1"/&gt; Despite losing its national title, the sycamore remained the largest American sycamore in West Virginia.&lt;ref name = "Gillespie2"/&gt;

During the West Virginia Centennial "big-tree contest" of 1963, the honorific of the state's largest tree went to a [[Quercus alba|white oak]] (''Quercus alba'') near [[Huttonsville, West Virginia|Huttonsville]] in [[Randolph County, West Virginia|Randolph County]], thus beating out the Webster Sycamore.&lt;ref name = "SGM1"/&gt; The white oak measured {{convert|11.25|ft|m}} in diameter.&lt;ref name = "SGM1"/&gt; An [[elm]] (''Ulmus'') tree in [[Putnam County, West Virginia|Putnam County]] also bested the Webster Sycamore at {{convert|8|ft|m}} in diameter.&lt;ref name = "SGM1"/&gt;

During a speech to the [[United States Senate]] in honor of West Virginia Day on June 20, 2004, U.S. Senator [[Robert C. Byrd]] mentioned the Webster Sycamore while boasting of "the biggest and best of West Virginia".&lt;ref name = "USC1"&gt;{{Harvnb|United States Congress|2004|p=12983.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preservation ==
The land upon which the Webster Sycamore was located was owned by the Purdee and Curtin Lumber Company of nearby Webster Springs.&lt;ref name = "Gillespie1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt; The company spared the tree in the 1950s, during its [[lumber]] operations in the area.&lt;ref name = "Gillespie2"/&gt; According to [[West Virginia University]] biologist W.&amp;nbsp;H. Gillespie in ''[[Castanea (journal)|Castanea]]'', the tree stood as "a memorial of the original virgin forest".&lt;ref name = "Gillespie2"/&gt; The Purdee and Curtin Lumber Company preserved the land surrounding the tree as a park, known as Big Sycamore Park.&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt; The park was utilized by campers, and by tourists visiting the tree.&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt; A [[swinging bridge]] across the Back Fork of Elk River provided access to the tree and the park.&lt;ref name = "Hannah1"/&gt;

In 2002, the Webster Sycamore was one of five trees nominated by the West Virginia Humanities Council to the National Register of Historic Trees, a registry of historic trees maintained by the American Forests Historic Tree Nursery.&lt;ref name = "CDM5"/&gt;

During the annual events Webster Wildwater Weekend in April and the Webster County Nature Weekend in May, hiking excursions were led to the Webster Sycamore, in addition to the nearby Three Falls of Back Fork.&lt;ref name = "CDM3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCG2"&gt;{{cite news| title =Webster river races next month| newspaper =[[Charleston Gazette-Mail|The Charleston Gazette]]| publication-place =[[Charleston, West Virginia]]| date =March 26, 2003| url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13816656.html| accessdate =October 5, 2015| subscription =yes| via =[[HighBeam Research]]| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20161018221304/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13816656.html| archivedate =October 18, 2016| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "TBS1"&gt;{{cite news| last = Fletcher | first = Thomas R. | title =Climbing the mountain and viewing the valley Weekend: The Webster County Nature Tour in early May offers a choice of hikes, from an easy walk to a strenuous trek, in scenic West Virginia | newspaper = [[The Baltimore Sun]] | publication-place = Baltimore | date =April 19, 1998 | url = http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-04-19/features/1998109239_1_elk-mountain-elk-river-mountain-ridge | accessdate = October 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005154640/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-04-19/features/1998109239_1_elk-mountain-elk-river-mountain-ridge |archive-date=October 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vandalism and death ==
On the afternoon of September 3, 2007, a malicious fire was set in the base of the Webster Sycamore's trunk.&lt;ref name = "TCG1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDM2"&gt;{{cite news| title =Old tree in Webster target of arson| newspaper =[[Charleston Daily Mail]]| publication-place =[[Charleston, West Virginia]]| date =September 4, 2007| url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-9983318.html| accessdate =October 5, 2015| subscription =yes| via =[[HighBeam Research]]| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160411043145/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-9983318.html| archivedate =April 11, 2016| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire burned up through the hollow center of the tree's hollow bole.&lt;ref name = "TCG1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CDM2"/&gt; The Webster Springs Fire Department, Webster County Sheriff's Department, and the [[West Virginia Division of Forestry]] provided a joint response to the fire, and remained on the scene for several hours until the flames were out.&lt;ref name = "TCG1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CDM2"/&gt; The tree survived the blaze but suffered irreparable damage.&lt;ref name = "TCG1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CDM2"/&gt;

Initially following the fire, the tree's vicinity was closed for the investigation and for an assessment of the extent of damage and safety risk.&lt;ref name = "TCG1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CDM2"/&gt; On September 27, 2007, the West Virginia Division of Forestry's urban forestry coordinator Bob Hannah and technical specialist Jennifer Brashears engaged in an inspection and evaluation of the tree to provide recommendations.&lt;ref name = "Hannah1"/&gt; In their report, Hannah and Brashears assessed that the tree's "severe structural weakness" was not caused by the fire, and instead highlighted the tree's "size, age, and severity of defects" as the cause of its instability.&lt;ref name = "Hannah1"/&gt; They did, however, assess that the fire may have caused further mortality of the tree's [[cambium]].&lt;ref name = "Hannah2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hannah|Brashears|2007|p=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used various measurements developed by the [[International Society of Arboriculture]] and the [[United States Forest Service]] to formulate a tree risk assessment.&lt;ref name = "Hannah1"/&gt; At the time of their investigation, the tree's diameter at breast height was {{convert|8.42|ft|m}}, with 27% of the trunk consisting of open space.&lt;ref name = "Hannah1"/&gt; Hannah and Brashears also found that one-third of the lower trunk and [[root crown]] demonstrated callus formation and no new growth, but instead severe decay and peeling bark.&lt;ref name = "Hannah1"/&gt; Hannah and Brashears further determined that structural mitigation was not feasible, and that the Webster Sycamore was to be "considered an extreme hazard" and the public should be "excluded from its striking zone through fencing and signage".&lt;ref name = "Hannah1"/&gt;

The investigation into the fire was led by the Division of Forestry's chief investigator, Sam Butcher.&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt; The investigation lasted four months, and once a suspect had been identified, the case was turned over to the Webster County [[Prosecutor#United States|prosecuting attorney]]'s office.&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt; Butcher credited Art Yagel, a Division of Forestry investigator, for bringing the investigation to its conclusion.&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt; In January 2008, a 17-year-old suspect from [[Bergoo, West Virginia|Bergoo]] was formally charged with a [[felony]] count of [[arson]] for setting fire to the tree, while a second juvenile was also charged with a [[misdemeanor]] for providing false information to investigators.&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt; The suspect was also charged with misdemeanor counts of providing false information to conservation officers, possession of [[marijuana]], and [[Alcohol consumption by youth in the United States|underage consumption of alcohol]].&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt; The second juvenile was not involved in the setting of the fire.&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt;

Following the fire, experts recommended that the Webster Sycamore be [[felling|felled]] or fenced off as a security measure.&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt; According to the Division of Forestry, the tree was finally brought down during the summer of 2010.&lt;ref name = "CDM4"/&gt;

In recognition of the tree, the Health Policy Division of the Office of the West Virginia Insurance Commissioner considered the name "Sycamore Healthcare Exchange" as one of the naming options for West Virginia's [[health insurance marketplace]] in 2011, following the passage of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref name = "HPD1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bewv.wvinsurance.gov/Portals/2/pdf/Insurance%20Exchange%20Name%20and%20Tag%20Options.pdf | title = WVINS-2225: Name and Tagline Options | work = Health Policy Division, Office of the West Virginia Insurance Commissioner website | publisher = Health Policy Division, Office of the West Virginia Insurance Commissioner |year = 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005154841/http://bewv.wvinsurance.gov/Portals/2/pdf/Insurance%20Exchange%20Name%20and%20Tag%20Options.pdf |archive-date=October 5, 2015 | accessdate = October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
