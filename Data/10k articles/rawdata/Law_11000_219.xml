      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9518">{{Politics of American Samoa}}
A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[American Samoa]] on November 2, 2010, on the same day of the [[United States House of Representatives election in American Samoa, 2010|United States House of Representatives election]] and [[American Samoan general election, 2010|American Samoan general election]].

Voters voted on amendments to the [[Constitution of American Samoa]] which had been approved by a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional convention]] held from June 21 through July 2, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;''Government of American Samoa'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; the 4th such convention. The changes were ultimately rejected by a majority of over 4,000 votes.&lt;ref name="APresult"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kpua.net/news.php?id=21505 |title=Faleomavaega wins 12th election to Congress |date=November 4, 2010 |work=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=November 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716025015/http://www.kpua.net/news.php?id=21505 |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed changes==
There were a total of 34&lt;ref name="APresult"/&gt; or 39&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=56697|title=Faleomavaega doubts success of federal law challenge in American Samoa|date=October 28, 2010|work=Radio New Zealand|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed amendments to the Constitution.

At a Constitutional convention in the middle of 2010, the subject of autonomy for American Samoa was discussed, with the issue being raised by the territory's non-voting member in the [[United States House of Representatives]], [[Eni Faleomavaega]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=54201|title=American Samoa call for autonomy referendum|date=June 16, 2010|work=[[Radio New Zealand]]|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resulting from this, the proposed Constitution replaced all mentions of "Government of American Samoa" with "American Samoa Government".&lt;ref&gt;''Government of American Samoa'', pp. 6–16&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a paragraph in the preamble to the Constitution was proposed to be changed to reflect that American Samoans should "have and enjoy certain rights ... including the right to local self-government".&lt;ref&gt;''Government of American Samoa'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, if the changes were accepted, any federal American law seen as being harmful to the economy of the territory or the welfare of American Samoans could be blocked by the Fono.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=56776|title=American Samoa votes|date=November 2, 2010|accessdate=November 3, 2010|work=[[Radio New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other proposed changes to the Constitution included expanding the [[American Samoa House of Representatives]] from 20 members (plus one non-voting member from [[Swains Island]]) to 25 (plus one), and the [[American Samoa Senate]] from 18 to 22 members.&lt;ref&gt;''Government of American Samoa'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of the [[List of governors of American Samoa|Governor of American Samoa]]'s veto would have changed with the introduction of [[veto override]] into the Constitution, whereby a bill passed by a two-thirds majority by both houses of the [[American Samoa Fono]] within 14 months of an original veto will become law immediately.&lt;ref name=p13&gt;''Government of American Samoa'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; As the referendum failed, any vetoed law re-passed by the Fono still requires further approval by the Governor or the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]].&lt;ref name="p13"/&gt; A prior referendum on the issue in 2008 failed by 112 votes, after original results showed a mere 22-vote margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.samoanews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=2142|author=Fili Sagapolutele|title=Election 2008 – Unfinished Business|accessdate=October 18, 2010|work=Samoa News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135414/http://www.samoanews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=2142|archive-date=2011-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revised draft included a proposal to effect an [[order of succession]] should the office of Governor or [[Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa]] be vacant.&lt;ref&gt;''Government of American Samoa'', pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Constitution would have also provided a [[Samoan language]] curriculum in the territory's educational system, and introduced a system for [[post-secondary education]] to American Samoa.&lt;ref&gt;''Government of American Samoa'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it would have established a Public Utilities and Services Commission for the territory, and mandated the enforcement of immigration laws "in order to protect the Samoan culture, lands and way of life".&lt;ref&gt;''Government of American Samoa'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigning and controversy==
Despite there being between 30 and 40 different proposed changes to the Constitution which had been approved at the Constitutional convention, all the changes were put to the polls together in a single-question referendum. Voters only had the choice to approve all or reject all the proposals, and could not vote on each one individually,&lt;ref name="govdeny"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.samoanews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=19844&amp;edition=1287309600|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135453/http://www.samoanews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=19844&amp;edition=1287309600|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 17, 2011|title=Gov dismisses claims he is responsible for one-question referendum|author=Fili Sagapolutele|date=October 17, 2010|accessdate=October 18, 2010|work=Samoa News}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in criticism from voters.&lt;ref name="APresult"/&gt;

Governor [[Togiola Tulafono]] was accused of presenting it as a single question in the poll because he wanted approval for all the changes, a charge he denied. The decision to put all the changes on the ballot as a single question had been made by the chief elections officer,&lt;ref name="govdeny"/&gt; who claimed it was "the simplest way to put the question to voters."&lt;ref name="APresult"/&gt;

Limited public campaigning took place on the issue of rejecting the constitutional referendum.&lt;ref name="SamoaNewsResult"/&gt; In [[Tualauta County, American Samoa|Tualauta County]] in the [[Western District, American Samoa|Western District]], the most heavily populated county in American Samoa, there was reportedly concentrated lobbying against the referendum, which was defeated by 609 votes.&lt;ref name="SamoaNewsResult"/&gt;

The only other public campaigning occurred in [[Utulei, American Samoa|Utulei]] and [[Tafuna, American Samoa|Tafuna]], where a number of residents campaigned against the vote with an advertisement which centered around the decision of the chief elections officer to group all the proposed changes together. The advertisement complained that the amendments "should have been separated, item by item and placed individually on the ballot; they weren't".&lt;ref name="SamoaNewsResult"/&gt;

==Voting==
The ballot contained the following sole question, printed in both English and Samoan in bold, block letters: "Do you approve the 2010 amendments to the Revised Constitution of American Samoa?" Voters had a choice of voting "yes" or "no".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.samoanews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=20214|title=ELECTION UPDATE: Sample ballot for referendum released|author=Fili Sagapolutele|work=Samoa News|accessdate=November 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135511/http://www.samoanews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=20214|archive-date=2011-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering''' is the research group at The Institute of Infrastructure and Environment, [[University of Edinburgh]] conducting research in fire, structures and environment.

The [[University of Edinburgh]] has a long tradition in [[Fire Protection Engineering]] research and education and is recognized internationally for its work since the early 1970s. The Centre is currently formed in association with the [[Building Research Establishment]] (BRE) to integrate the resources of both institutions and provide a thrust for [[fire protection engineering]] research and education. It has a state-of-the-art experimental facility (the Rushbrook Fire Safety Laboratory) and staff whose expertise covers a wide range of subjects in Fire Safety.

The Fire Research Centre is deeply involved in setting the direction for the Fire Safety Engineering practice.

==History==
The University of Edinburgh was the university to offer a degree in Fire Engineering, and appointed [[David Rasbash]] as the first ever Professor of Fire Safety Engineering in 1974. Many of those who are now leaders in the field came to Edinburgh to study and research under the supervision of Rasbash, one of the main pioneers of the discipline, and [[Dougal Drysdale]], author of the definitive text book on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471972916.html An Introduction to Fire Dynamics, Dougal Drysdale, 2nd Edition, John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jose Torero]] held the BRE/RAE Chair in Fire Safety Engineering from 2004 to 2012. Albert Simeoni held the BRE chair from 2013 to 2015. Teaching and research in fire safety continues at Edinburgh under the leadership of Prof Grunde Jomaas, appointed as the BRE Chair in Fire Safety Engineering in 2016.

==Staff==
The staff of the BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering comprises nine academics, several research associates, about 25 postgraduate researchers and a few undergraduate researchers.

==Teaching==
The Centre supports the Structural and Fire Safety Engineering degrees (BEng, MEng and MSc) as well as a number of short courses for professionals.

More recently, the new International Master of Science in Fire Safety Engineering has been approved by Erasmus Mundus (the European commission's cooperation and mobility programme in the field of European higher education). The joint degree started in September 2010 and involves the universities of [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] (UK), [[Ghent University|Ghent]] (Belgium) and [[Lund University|Lund]] (Sweden).&lt;ref&gt;[http://edinburghfireresearch.blogspot.com/2009/07/new-international-master-in-fire-safety.html New International Master in Fire Safety Engineering approved by Erasmus Mundus (accessed 31 July 09)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research Expertise==
* Structural Fire Engineering
* Fire Modelling
* Ignition and burning of solid fuels
* Large-scale fire experiments
* Concrete, Steel and wood response to fire
* Tunnel fires
* Subsurface fires
* Wildfires
* [[Smouldering]] combustion

==Large-scale fire test==
The [[Cardington test]]s were a series of large-scale fire tests conducted in over several years from the early 1990s in a real steel-framed structure at the former [[airship hangar]] at [[RAF Cardington|Cardington]], UK.

The [[Dalmarnock tests]] were a series of fire experiments conducted in July 2006 in a real 1960s concrete tower block in [[Dalmarnock]], [[Glasgow]], UK.

==Publications==
The Centre publishes more than 100 conference papers and a dozen peer-reviewed journal papers per year. Some can be publicly accessed via [http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/1152 their Digital Repository].

'''''Bailey v. United States''''', 568 U.S. 186 (2013),&lt;ref&gt;''Bailey v. United States'', {{ussc|volume=568|page=186|year=2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case concerning [[search and seizure]]. A 6–3 decision reversed the weapons conviction of a [[Long Island]] man who had been detained when police followed his vehicle after he left his apartment just before it was to be searched. Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote the [[majority opinion]], and [[Antonin Scalia]] filed a [[concurring opinion|concurrence]]. [[Stephen Breyer]] [[dissenting opinion|dissented]].

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] had upheld the conviction. It accepted the government's argument that the Court's 1981 holding in ''[[Michigan v. Summers]]'' that persons in the immediate vicinity of a search can be detained while the search was being executed was broad enough to cover the pursuit and detention of a defendant who had left the scene in a vehicle. Kennedy's opinion held that it did not, since once Bailey had driven away none of the law-enforcement interests the earlier holding identified were involved. Scalia said that the only thing that mattered was that the vehicle was no longer in the immediate vicinity, and that [[balancing test]]s created confusion. Breyer argued that the police did, in fact, have those interests despite Bailey's departure by vehicle.

==Background==
On Thursday, July 28, 2005 officers of the Suffolk County, New York, police department obtained a warrant to search the basement apartment of a house for a .380-caliber handgun. The warrant was obtained based on a tip by a confidential informant who told police officers that he had seen the gun on a previous weekend when purchasing drugs at the apartment from a man named "Polo."

Before executing the search warrant, two officers surveilling the apartment observed two men exit the apartment complex, both of whom matched the description provided by the confidential informant. The officers watched the men get into a car and drive away.

The officers followed the two individuals for approximately 5 minutes or one mile, and then pulled the men over. They ordered the men out of the car and conducted a pat down search, which turned no weapons or contraband. The officers then seized the driver's keys and handcuffed both men. The officers told them men that they were not under arrest, but were being detained incident to the execution of the search warrant.

The officers drove the two men back to the apartment, which by then had been secured and searched by other officers. The search turned up multiple guns, ammunition, drugs and drug paraphernalia.  Both men were then formally placed under arrest.

Chunon L. Bailey, one of the two men arrested, was charged with possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute and possessing a firearm as a felon. He moved to suppress the evidence based on his unlawful detention after he had already left his apartment. The trial court rejected that motion, holding that the detention was justified under ''[[Michigan v. Summers]]''. The defendant was convicted and, on appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] agreed.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Bailey'', {{cite court |vol=652 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=197 |pinpoint= |court=[[2d Cir.]] |date=2011 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20110706076 |accessdate=2018-08-02 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal Background==
In ''[[Michigan v. Summers]]'', 452 U.S. 692 (1981), the Court adopted the categorical rule that officers executing a search warrant for contraband may detain the occupants of the premises while the search is conducted. In the ruling, three justifications were identified for detaining occupants while executing a search warrant: (1) the legitimate law enforcement interest in preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found, (2) the interest in minimizing the risk of harm to the officers, and (3) the orderly completion of the search, which may be facilitated if the occupants of the premises are present. This case presents the question whether the rule of Summers extends to the detention of a former occupant who has left the immediate vicinity of the premises before the warrant is executed.

===Commentary===
Multiple scholars have questioned the efficacy of applying ''[[Michigan v. Summers]]'' to individuals who have departed the premises being searched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook journal | first=Albert | last=Alschuler | title=Bright Line Fever and the Fourth Amendment | volume=111 | journal=Univ. of Pitt. L.R. | page=270 | pin=274 | year=1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="ali"&gt;{{Bluebook journal | first=Amir Hatem | last=Ali | title=Following the Bright Line of Michigan v. Summers | volume=45 | journal=Harv. Civ. Lib. Civ. Rts. J. | page=483 | pin=500-02 | url=http://harvardcrcl.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/483-516.pdf | year=2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; One commentator, in examining the application of ''Michigan v. Summers'' over the course of thirty years, acknowledged the lack of clarity in the Supreme Court's original decision as to whether the categorical rule that occupants may be detained applies to "recent occupants":

{{quote|as some courts have recognized, in the case where the limited authority to detain occupants includes the authority to detain individuals who have already left the premises, the rationale underlying Summers is severely undercut. First, in these cases, the intrusion posed by detention is more pronounced because the individual is detained outside of his place of residence, often in public, and transported back to the residence being searched. Thus, unlike Summers, the detention adds more significantly to “the public stigma associated with the search” and involves both “the inconvenience” and “the indignity” of being transported by the police. Second, where the “occupant” is not present on the premises at the time of the search, the law enforcement interests are also severely undercut. Because the individual is not present on the premises, he will generally not be aware that a search is being conducted and, therefore, there is no risk of flight upon the discovery of incriminating evidence. Additionally, an individual who has exited the premises poses no risk of harm to the police officers or other occupants.&lt;ref name ="ali" /&gt;}}

He argues that this is one way in which the rule from ''Michigan v. Summers'' has been "extended well beyond what the Court’s initial rationale should reasonably allow" and, as a result, has "put at risk the very liberty interests that it was designed to protect."&lt;ref name ="ali" /&gt;

== Opinion of the Court ==
In a 6–3 decision, the Court reversed and remanded the Second Circuit Court's ruling, stating that it was an unreasonable seizure under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. Writing for the majority, [[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]] agreed that the'' Michigan v. Summers ''ruling was broad enough to cover the pursuit and detention of a suspect who had left the scene. However, because none of the law-enforcement interests the earlier holding identified were involved, officers did not have probable cause in this case to detain the suspects a mile away from the scene before the apartment was searched, and it thus added an additional level of intrusiveness: "As demonstrated here, detention beyond the immediate vicinity can involve an initial detention away from the scene and a second detention at the residence. In between, the individual will suffer the additional indignity of a compelled transfer back to the premises".&lt;ref&gt;P. 15, slip op., ''Bailey v. United States'', U.S. Sup. Ct. (February 19, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] concurred in the judgment. Joined by [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Justices Ginsburg]] and [[Elena Kagan|Kagan]], he however argued that once suspects leave the immediate vicinity, the scope and balancing tests of the ''Michigan v. Summers'' ruling should no longer apply because ordinary law enforcement interests would then take over: "The Summers exception is appropriately predicated only on law enforcement's interest in carrying out the search unimpeded by violence or other disruptions ... Preventing flight is not a special governmental interest—it is indistinguishable from the ordinary interest in apprehending suspects. Similarly, the interest in inducing residents to open locked doors or containers [to facilitate the orderly completion of the search] is nothing more than the ordinary interest in investigating crime".&lt;ref&gt;P. 22, slip op., ''Bailey v. United States'', U.S. Sup. Ct. (February 19, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Breyer|Justice Breyer]], joined with [[Clarence Thomas|Justices Thomas]] and [[Samuel Alito|Alito]], filed a dissenting opinion. Breyer argued that officers did, in fact, have those law-enforcement interests, but also had reasonable justifications for stopping the suspects away from their apartment. "Considerations related to the risks of flight, of evidence destruction, and of physical danger overcome any administrative advantages. Consider why the officers here waited until the occupants had left the block to stop them: They did so because the occupants might have been armed".&lt;ref&gt;P. 28, slip op., ''Bailey v. United States'', U.S. Sup. Ct. (February 19, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3917">A '''referendum on the constitution of the [[Batavian Republic]]''' was held on August 8, 1797. The draft constitution was rejected, eventually culminating in a coup d'état.

==Background==
The country we now know as the [[Netherlands]] had declared independence as the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Provinces]] ({{lang-nl|Republiek der Zeeven Vereenigde Provinciën}}) in 1581. This independence was officially recognized in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648. As the name indicates, the country was a federation of seven autonomous provinces: the duchy of [[Gelre]], the counties of [[Holland]] and [[Zeeland]], the former bishopric of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], the [[lord#Feudalism|lordship]] of [[Overijssel]] and the free provinces of [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. Each province was governed by the Provincial States; the main executive official was a [[stadtholder]] (''stadhouder'' in Dutch). Over the years, these stadtholderships were concentrated among the descendants of [[William the Silent]].

This led to a friction with the ''regenten'', the wealthy merchant class, who were mainly based in [[Amsterdam]]. They saw the central position of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] in Dutch politics as a threat to their own power. The infighting between the regents and the Orangists was one of the causes of the downturn of the Netherlands as a global economic and military power throughout the 18th century.

In the 1780s, the tensions came to a head in the [[Batavian Revolution]], a struggle between republican [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriots]] and royalist [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangists]]. The Patriots, aided by French troops, eventually managed to drive stadtholder [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]] out of the country in late 1794. A few weeks later, on January 19, 1795, the [[Batavian Republic]] was proclaimed.

The ''[[National Assembly of the Batavian Republic|Nationale Vergadering]]'' (National Assembly) subsequently went through two years of discussions. On May 10, 1797, a final draft constitution was formed. The constitution was a compromise between two groups: those who felt that the ''gewesten'' (regions) in the Republic should maintain their historic autonomy, and those who felt that the Republic should become a [[unitary state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.paulbordewijk.nl/artikelen/204|title=Referendum Europese Grondwet had omineuze voorganger|publisher=''[[de Volkskrant]]''|author=Paul Bordewijk|date=2003-09-15|accessdate=2008-04-15|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

==Aftermath==
The draft constitution had been rejected by almost eighty percent, which meant that a new Constitution would have to be drafted. In the elections for the National Assembly a few months later, the supporters of a unitary state won the majority, but the supporters of a federal state retained the majority in the constitutional commission. Meanwhile, in France, the radicalists led by [[Pierre Augereau]] had seized power. With French help, the radical unitarists staged a [[coup d'état]] in [[1798|January 1798]]. A new constitution, establishing a unitary republic, was quickly adopted in the National Assembly. This draft constitution was approved in [[Batavian Republic constitutional referendum, 1798|a referendum]] on April 23, 1798.

The second Edition. Faithfully corrected according to divers ancient Manuscripts of the same Booke. By Edm. Wingate, Gent.]]|edition=2nd|location=London|publisher=Printed by the assignes of John Moore, Esquire [Miles Fletcher, John Haviland and Robert Young]|year=1640|oclc=79739905}}.&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[Edmund Wingate]]]]

'''''Britton''''' is the earliest summary of the [[law]] of [[England]] in the [[Law French|French]] tongue, which purports to have been written by command of [[Edward I of England|King Edward&amp;nbsp;I]].

The origin and authorship of the work have been much disputed. It has been attributed to [[John de Breton|John le Breton]], [[bishop of Hereford]], on the authority of a passage found in some MSS.{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} of the history of [[Matthew of Westminster]]; there are difficulties, however, involved in this theory, inasmuch as the bishop of Hereford died in 1275, whereas allusions are made in ''Britton'' to several statutes passed after that time, and more particularly to the well-known statute ''[[Quia emptores]]'', which was passed in 1290. It was the opinion of [[John Selden]] that the book derived its title from [[Henry de Bracton]], the last of the chief justiciaries, whose name is sometimes spelled in the [[fine rolls]] "Bratton" and "Bretton", and that it was a royal abridgment of Bracton's great work on the customs and laws of England, with the addition of certain subsequent statutes. The arrangement, however, of the two works is different, and but a small proportion of Bracton's work is incorporated in ''Britton''. The work is entitled in an early manuscript of the 14th century, which was once in the possession of Selden, and is now in the [[Cambridge University Library]], ''Summa de legibus Anglie que vocatur Bretone''; and it is described as "a book called Bretoun" in the will of [[Andrew Horn]], the learned chamberlain of the [[City of London]], who bequeathed it to the chamber of the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] in 1329, together with another book called ''[[The Mirror of Justices|Mirroir des Justices]]''.

''Britton'' was first printed in London by Robert Redman, without a date, probably about the year 1530. Another edition of it was printed in 1640, corrected by [[Edmund Wingate]].&lt;ref name="Britton 2nd ed"/&gt; A third edition of it, with an [[English language|English]] translation, was published at the [[Oxford University Press|University Press, Oxford]], 1865, by F. M. Nichol. An English translation of the work without the [[Law French|French]] text had been previously published by [[Robert Kelham]] in 1762.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="954">'''Burlaw court''', ''{{lang-ru|Товарищеский суд}}'' (verb. "court of comrades") was a special form of collective justice that existed in the [[Soviet Union]]. Burlaw courts were elected for the term of two years by open voting of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|working collective]] members, and were entitled to consider minor offences and to impose fines up to 50 [[Soviet ruble]]s (compared to the average monthly salary of 120 rubles) or to pass the case for consideration to regular courts of justice. After the breakdown of the Soviet Union burlaw courts were no longer elected and were finally abolished by adoption of [[Criminal Code of Russia|Russia's new Criminal Code]] in 1997.

"'''Cartoon Wars Part I'''" is the third episode in the [[South Park (season 10)|tenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 142nd episode of the series overall, it first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on April 5, 2006. It is the first part of a two-episode story-arc, which concludes with "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]". In the episode, it is announced that a ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode will air with the [[Muslim]] prophet [[Muhammad]] as a character, leaving the whole of the United States fearing for their lives. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] apparently believes that the episode is offensive to Muslims and decides to go to [[Hollywood]] to try to get the episode pulled.

The episode was written by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. Parker and fellow series co-creator [[Matt Stone]] originally planned for this episode to be the first of season ten, but disagreements with Comedy Central regarding the [[Depictions of Muhammad|depiction of Muhammad]] forced them to postpone it until later in the season. Once production on the episode began, the dispute still had not been resolved, so it was decided that the story would be split into two separate episodes to allow for more negotiations between the two sides. A similar story-arc was used in the [[South Park (season 14)|season fourteen]] episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]".

==Plot==
The townspeople of South Park are in a panic late one night when they discover that a cartoon is going to show an episode featuring [[Muhammad]] as a character. Everyone hides in the Community Center for fear of an [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorist attack]] and [[Randy Marsh (South Park)|Randy]] announces that the cartoon is ''[[Family Guy]]''. The next morning, everyone is thrilled to find out that there was no attack and that [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] censored the image of Muhammad.

It is later announced that the ''Family Guy'' episode was just part one of a two-parter, and that part two will air the following week—without censorship. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] believes that this is insulting to Muslims, declaring that Fox was right to censor Muhammad. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], who likes ''Family Guy'', thinks that he is faking, but, when Cartman gives an impassioned speech about keeping people from getting hurt, Kyle is guilt-ridden and believes him. Kyle agrees to go with Cartman to [[Hollywood]] to get the ''Family Guy'' episode pulled.

The people of South Park, meanwhile, decide to literally [[Ostrich effect|bury their heads in the sand]], so as to show Islamists that they have no part in the insult. On the way to Hollywood, Kyle discovers that Cartman only wants to get ''Family Guy'' cancelled and does not care about the Muslims. Cartman decides to go at it alone, but Kyle insists he will not let that happen. The two start racing one another on their [[Big Wheel (tricycle)|Big Wheels]], until Cartman successfully loses Kyle.

U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] meets with the Fox executives. The Fox president says that there is something secret about the ''Family Guy'' writers that Bush needs to know. At this point, it is revealed this is a two-part episode and that the conclusion will be given in the next episode.

==Production==
In the DVD commentaries for season ten, series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] spoke about how they experienced difficulties with Comedy Central during the production of ''Cartoon Wars Part I'' and ''Cartoon Wars Part II''. They originally wanted to open season ten with these episodes, but were forced to postpone them until later in the season, due to Comedy Central not approving of the [[Depictions of Muhammad|depiction of Muhammad]]. Instead, the season opened with "[[The Return of Chef]]", after one of the show's former actors, [[Isaac Hayes]], released a statement bad-mouthing ''South Park'' over a previous dispute. Even as Parker and Stone continued to work on ''Cartoon Wars'', the dispute between them and the network had still not been resolved. As a result, the plot was developed into a two-part story-arc to allow for more negotiations between the two sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]; [[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]]|date=2006|title=South Park season ten DVD commentary for the episode "The Return of Chef"| medium=DVD|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Commentary"&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]; [[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]]|date=2006|title=South Park season ten DVD commentary for the episode "Cartoon Wars Part I"| medium=DVD|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker and Stone also clarified their opinions on ''Family Guy''; Parker stated: "we do hate it [...] we understand that people love it [...] we certainly don't think it should be taken off the air [...] we just don't respect it in terms of writing". The two later referred to the writers behind the show as "smart" but emphatically criticized their overuse of "gag-humor". After "Cartoon Wars Part I" aired, Parker and Stone said that they were contacted by the staff of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[King of the Hill]]'', who both gave praise for lampooning ''Family Guy''. Parker said that the staff of ''The Simpsons'' hate ''Family Guy'' more than they do, and that ''King of the Hill''{{'}}s staff said to them, "you're doing God's work". The depictions of [[Bart Simpson]] and ''King of the Hill''{{'}}s writing staff in "Cartoon Wars Part II" were influenced by the two shows contacting ''South Park''. Parker and Stone also expressed a level of disappointment with how the episode was received. They felt that people ignored the scope of the Muhammad plot elements and found that more trivial aspects of the show received more attention than they deserved.&lt;ref name="Commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]; [[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]]|date=2006|title=South Park season ten DVD commentary for the episode "Cartoon Wars Part II"| medium=DVD|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South Park (season 14)|season fourteen]] episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" also feature a story-arc involving depictions of Muhammad and censorship in general. Like "Cartoon Wars Part I" and "Cartoon Wars Part II", "200" and particularly "201" caused a large amount of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neal, Sean (April 14, 2010).

Eric Goldman of ''[[IGN]]'' gave the episode a 7.0 out of 10, praising the depiction of ''Family Guy'' and the cliffhanger ending.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Eric (April 6, 2006).

The '''''Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918''''' is an Act of the [[Australian Parliament]] passed in 1918 which replaced the ''[[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902]]'', which had defined who was entitled to [[vote]] in [[Elections in Australia|Australian federal elections]], and the ''Commonwealth Electoral Act'' 1902.&lt;ref name=CEA1902&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1902A00019/ddbfc5b8-519f-4f9f-a22d-b93bc477522d| title=Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902 |publisher=legislation.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1902 Franchise Act set uniform national franchise criteria, establishing the [[voting age]] at 21 years and [[women's suffrage]] at the national level, also  a right to stand for election to the Parliament. That Act also disqualified from voting a number of categories of people, including [[Indigenous peoples]] from Australian, Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands (except New Zealand [[Māori language|Maori]]), even if citizens of the British Empire. A [[plurality voting system]] ("first-past-the-post") was established. The 1902 Act also made it clear that no person could vote more than once at each election. The 1902 Act was amended in 1906 to allow [[postal voting]]. In 1908, a permanent [[electoral roll]] was established and in 1911 it became compulsory for eligible voters to enrol. Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in [[voter turnout]], even though voting was still voluntary.{{Ref|enrolment}} From 1912, elections have been held on Saturdays.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

The 1918 Act was introduced by the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] of [[Billy Hughes]], the main purpose of which was to replace [[first-past-the-post voting]] with [[instant-runoff voting]] ("preferential voting") for the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Australian Senate|Senate]]. It continues to be the core legislation governing the conduct of elections in Australia, having been amended on numerous occasions since 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cea1918233/|work=Commonwealth Consolidated Acts|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
===1918 Act===
The 1918 Act replaced the ''Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902'' and the ''Commonwealth Electoral Act'' 1902.&lt;ref name=CEA1902 /&gt; It replaced first-past-the-post voting with instant-runoff voting ("preferential voting") for the House of Representatives and the Senate. (Preferential voting had been pioneered by Queensland in 1892.)&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia's major electoral developments Timeline: 1900 - Present|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/Reform_present.htm|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voting system was changed by the anti-Labor Hughes after the [[Swan by-election, 1918|1918 Swan by-election]], which saw the Labor candidate win with 34% of the vote due to a split in the anti-Labor vote between the Nationalist and [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] candidates, with 29.6% and 31.4% respectively.

The Act also repeated the special jurisdiction of the [[High Court of Australia]] as the [[Court of Disputed Returns (Australia)|Court of Disputed Returns]] in federal election matters,&lt;ref name="1918 Act"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act||Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially established by Part XVI of the ''Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902''.

===1921 amendment===
In 1921, the Act was amended to disqualify anyone standing for federal parliament who "has resigned from the Parliament of a State and has the right, under the law of the State, if not elected to the Parliament of the Commonwealth, to be re-elected to the Parliament of the State without the holding of a poll". This amendment was made specifically to overrule an act passed by the Queensland state government, which allowed state MPs to automatically return to parliament without a by-election if they ran unsuccessfully for federal parliament. The Queensland government reportedly passed the legislation primarily for the benefit of [[Frank Forde]], a future prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1921A00014 ''Commonwealth Electoral Act 1921''], Federal Register of Legislation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian Prime Ministers|year=2000|isbn=1-86436-671-0|publisher=New Holland|chapter=Francis Michael Forde|author=Elaine Brown|editor=[[Michelle Grattan]] (ed.)|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1924 amendment===
[[Compulsory voting]] at federal elections was introduced in 1924,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compulsory Voting |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/voting/Compulsory_Voting.htm|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Commonwealth Electoral Act 1924''&lt;/ref&gt; as a condition of the Country Party agreeing to form an alliance with the then minority Nationalist Party. Compulsory voting saw voter turnout increasing from 59.36% to 91.39% at the [[Australian federal election, 1925|1925 federal election]]. 

===1949 amendments===
The [[Chifley Government]] amended the Electoral Act in [[1949 in Australia|1949]], in time for the [[Australian federal election, 1949|1949 federal election]], as follows:
* the number of senators was increased from 36 to 60 (10 from each State), an increase of 24, and the number of members of the House of Representatives from 74 to 121, an increase of 47. 
* the [[single transferable vote]] under a [[proportional voting system]] for the Senate was introduced.
Although in 1948 (effective in 1949) [[Australian nationality law]] had been altered to create an Australian citizenship, the nationality criterion for the franchise remained that of being a British subject.

===1962 amendments===
In [[1962 in Australia|1962]], the [[Menzies Government]] extended the franchise to [[Indigenous Australians]] at federal elections,&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Commonwealth Electoral Act 1962''&lt;/ref&gt; though enrolment was voluntary.

===1973 and 1974 amendments===
Changes to the Electoral Act in [[1973 in Australia|1973]] by the [[Whitlam Government]] included:
* the qualifying voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 years.
* the ACT and Northern Territory became entitled to representation in both Houses for the first time in 1974.
* the allowable quota variation of the number of electors in each division of a state was reduced from 20% to 10%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/cea21973260/s4.html Commonwealth Electoral Act (No. 2) 1973, s.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1984 amendments===
Changes to the Electoral Act in [[1984 in Australia|1984]] by the  [[Hawke Government]] included:
* an independent [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC) was established to administer the federal electoral system. 
* the number of senators was increased from 64 to 76 (12 from each State and two from each Territory), an increase of 12, and the number of members of the House of Representatives was increased from 125 to 148, an increase of 23. 
* the [[group voting ticket]] [[Australian Senate#Voting system|voting system]] (the original "above-the-line" voting) was introduced. 
* the registration of political parties was introduced to permit the printing of party names on ballot papers. 
* [[Political funding in Australia|public funding]] of election campaigns and disclosure of political donations and electoral expenditure was introduced. 
* the compulsory enrolment and voting requirement was extended to cover Indigenous Australians. 
* the franchise qualification was changed to [[Australian citizenship]], though [[British subject]]s on the roll immediately before 26 January 1984 retained enrolment and voting rights. 
* the grace period after an election is called before the [[Electoral register|electoral rolls]] are closed was extended to seven days and the time that polling places closed was changed from 8pm to 6pm.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;
* Section 282 was added, requiring the AEC to conduct a recount following a dissolution under section 57 of the Constitution as if only the elected candidates had been named on the ballot papers, and only half the number were to be elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00697 |section=282 Re‑count of Senate votes to determine order of election in other circumstances |title=Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 |date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Government of Australia |accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution requires the Senate to allocate long and short term senate seats, and this provides one way of determining which senators are allocated which terms. As of 2016, this method had not yet been applied,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/senate-terms-derryn-hinch-and-greens-lee-rhiannon-given-three-year-terms |title=Senate terms: Derryn Hinch and Greens' Lee Rhiannon given three years |first=Gareth |last=Hutchens |date=12 August 2016 |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite two bipartisan senate resolutions in favour of using it as well as two double dissolution elections (1987 and [[Australian_federal_election,_2016|2016]]).

===2016 amendments===
In 2016 the registered preference part of the Senate group ticket voting system was abolished,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016A00025 Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Act 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid undue influence of preference deals experienced in 2013,&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-26/aec-advertising-campaign-on-way-senators-are-elected/7356308 Senate voting changes explained in Australian Electoral Commission advertisements By political reporter Stephanie Anderson.

'''Customary international law''' is an aspect of [[international law]] involving the principle of custom. Along with [[Sources of international law#General principles of law|general principles of law]] and [[Treaty|treaties]], custom is considered by the [[International Court of Justice]], [[jurist]]s, the [[United Nations]], and its [[member states]] to be among the primary [[sources of international law]].

Many governments accept in principle the existence of customary international law, although there are differing opinions as to what rules are contained in it.

In 1950, the [[International Law Commission]] listed the following sources as forms of evidence to customary international law: treaties, decisions of national and international courts, national legislation, opinions of national legal advisors, diplomatic correspondence, and practice of international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/classes/iflr/customary.html#practice Evidence of State practice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226020443/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/classes/iflr/customary.html |date=2008-12-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of customary international law==

The International Court of Justice Statute defines customary international law in Article 38(1)(b) as "a general practice accepted as law."&lt;ref name="ICJ Statute"&gt;{{cite web
| title = Statute of the International Court of Justice
| url = http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/index.php?p1=4&amp;p2=2&amp;p3=0
| date = 
| accessdate = 30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is generally determined through two factors: the general practice of states and what states have accepted as law.&lt;ref&gt;Yoram Dinstein. 2004. ''The Conduct of Hostilities under the Law of International Armed Conflict'', pp. 5. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several kinds of customary international laws recognized by states. Some customary international laws rise to the level of ''jus cogens'' through acceptance by the international community as non-derogable  rights, while other customary international law may simply be followed by a small group of states. States are typically bound by customary international law regardless of whether the states have codified these laws domestically or through treaties.

===''Jus cogens''===

''See [[jus cogens]].''

A [[peremptory norm]] (also called ''jus cogens'', [[Latin]] for "compelling law") is a fundamental principle of international law which is accepted by the [[international community]] of states as a norm from which no [[derogation]] is ever permitted. These norms rooted from Natural Law principles,&lt;ref&gt;Władysław Czapliński. Jus Cogens and the Law of Treaties. In C.Tomuschat and J.M. Thouvenin (eds). 2006. The Fundamental Rules of the International Legal Order, pp. 83-98. Netherlands: Koninklijke Brill NV&lt;/ref&gt; and any laws conflicting with it should be considered null and void.&lt;ref&gt;Article 53 of the Vienna Conventions on the Law of Treaties (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples include various [[International criminal law|international crimes]]; a state violates customary international law if it permits or engages in [[slavery]], [[torture]], [[genocide]], [[war of aggression]], or [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]] &lt;ref&gt;M. Cherif Bassiouni.1998. International Crimes: jus cogens and Obligatio Erga Omnes, Law &amp; Contemporary Problems, 59: 63-74&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jus cogens'' and customary international law are not interchangeable. All ''jus cogens'' are customary international law through their adoption by states, but not all customary international laws rise to the level of peremptory norms. States can deviate from customary international law by enacting treaties and conflicting laws, but ''jus cogens'' are non-derogable.

== Codification of international customary law ==

Some international customary laws have been codified through [[treaty|treaties]] and domestic laws, while others are recognized only as customary law.

The [[laws of war]], also known as ''jus in bello'', were long a matter of customary law before they were [[Codification (law)|codified]] in the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], [[Geneva Conventions]], and other treaties. However, these conventions do not purport to govern all legal matters that may arise during war. Instead, Article 1(2) of Additional [[Protocol I]] dictates that customary international law governs legal matters concerning armed conflict not covered by other agreements.&lt;ref name="Protocol I"&gt;{{cite web
| title =Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I)
| url =http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/full/470?opendocument
| date = 8 June 1977
| accessdate = 30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yoram Dinstein. 2004. ''The Conduct of Hostilities under the Law of International Armed Conflict'', pp. 6-7. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silence as consent===

Generally, sovereign nations must consent in order to be bound by a particular treaty or legal norm. However, international customary laws are norms that have become pervasive enough internationally that countries need not consent in order to be bound. In these cases, all that is needed is that the state has not objected to the law. However, [[persistent objector|states that object]] to customary international law may not be bound by them unless these laws are deemed to be ''[[jus cogens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Fisheries Case (United Kingdom v Norway) (Judgement)'' [1951] ICJ Rep 116, 131 where it is stated '…the ten-mile rule would appear to be inapplicable as against Norway inasmuch as she has always opposed any attempt to apply it to the Norwegian coast.' The case can be found at: http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1951/3.html&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in a dispute with any nation that has not affirmed the "silence implies consent" principle, any invocation of the "silence implies consent" principle involves an appeal to custom, such that if that nation does not espouse the broader premise of acknowledging the existence of customary international law, such an appeal will depend on [[circular reasoning]] ("customary international law is binding because silence implies consent, and silence implies consent because the fact that silence implies consent is one aspect of customary international law").&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Consent and International Customary Law'''

It is commonly said that the international community is ‘anarchical’, in that there is no layer of higher government with absolute power to treat states like citizens.  This is in a way unsurprising, since most states could (if pressed) rely solely on themselves for survival.  States are thus in a position, unlike individual humans, to refuse the benefits and reciprocal responsibilities of participating in a community under law.

In recognition of this reality, it has long been a tenet of international law that a state must expressly consent to a rule (by, for example, signing a treaty) before it can be legally bound by the rule. Customary international law not only upsets this idea of consent, it does it by stealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dinesh|first1=Singh Rawat|title=Know Customary International Law|url=http://abclive.in/know-customary-international-law/|accessdate=30 April 2017|agency=ABC Live|issue=Online|publisher=ABC Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The International Court of Justice==

The [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]] acknowledges the existence of customary international law in Article 38(1)(b), incorporated into the [[United Nations Charter]] by Article 92: "The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply...international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law."

Customary international law "... consists of rules of law derived from the consistent conduct of [[Sovereign state|States]] acting out of the belief that the law required them to act that way."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenne, ''Practice and Methods of International Law'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  It follows that customary international law can be discerned by a "widespread repetition by States of similar international acts over time ([[Sources of international law#State practice|State practice]]); Acts must occur out of sense of [[obligation]] (''[[opinio juris]]''); Acts must be taken by a significant number of States and not be rejected by a significant number of States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationallaw.uslegal.com/sources-of-international-law/customary-international-law/|title=Customary International Law|work=uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A marker of customary international law is [[consensus]] among states exhibited both by widespread conduct and a discernible sense of obligation.

The two essential elements of customary international law are  [[Sources of international law#State practice|state practice]] and ''[[opinio juris sive necessitatis|opinio juris]]'', as confirmed by the International Court of Justice in the ''Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons''.&lt;ref&gt;"Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports" 1996, p. 226, 253, [64], http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/95/7495.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to the psychological element that is ''opinio juris'', the International Court of Justice further held in ''North Sea Continental Shelf'', that ''"not only must the acts concerned amount to a settle practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it... The States concerned must therefore feel that they are conforming to what amounts to a legal obligation."''.&lt;ref&gt;''North Sea Continental Shelf, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports'' 1969, pp. 3, 43, [74], http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/51/5535.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court emphasised the need to prove a ''"sense of legal duty"'' as distinct from ''"acts motivated by considerations of courtesy, convenience or tradition"''.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; This was subsequently confirmed in ''Nicaragua v. United States of America''.&lt;ref&gt;''Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports'' 1986, pp. 14, 98, [186], http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/70/6485.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilateral versus multilateral customary international law==

The recognition of different customary laws can range from simple [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] recognition of customary laws to worldwide [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] recognition. Regional customs can become customary international law in their respective regions, but do not become customary international law for nations outside the region. The existence of bilateral customary law was recognized by the International Court of Justice in the ''Right of Passage Over Indian Territory'' case between Portugal and India, in which the court found "no reason why long continued practice between the two states accepted by them as regulating their relations should not form the basis of mutual rights and obligations between the two states."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcourts.com/icj/eng/decisions/1960.04.12_right_of_passage.htm|title=Right of Passage over Indian Territory (Merits) (Port. v. India), 1960 I.C.J. 6 (Apr. 12)|work=worldcourts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other customary international laws==

Other examples accepted or claimed as customary international law include the principle of [[non-refoulement]] and [[Diplomatic immunity|immunity]] of visiting foreign [[Head of state|heads of state]]. United Nations Security Council in 1993 adopted Geneva conventions as customary international law because since the time being it has transformed itself into customary international law. If any treaty or law has been called as customary international law then parties which have not ratified said treaty will be bound to observe its provisions in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;Certain Norwegian Loans (France v Norway) (Jurisdiction) [1957] ICJ Rep 9, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was initially proposed by the Obama administration in June 2009, when the White House sent several proposed bills to Congress. The legislation was introduced in the House in July 2009. On December 2, 2009, revised versions of the bill were introduced in the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by then-Financial Services Committee Chairman [[Barney Frank]], and in the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Senate Banking Committee]] by former Chairman [[Chris Dodd]]. Dodd and Frank were both involved with the bill; the conference committee that reported on June 25, 2010&lt;ref name="actions"/&gt; voted to name the bill after both men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/06/25/it-has-a-name-the-doddfrank-act/ | title=It Has A Name: The Dodd/Frank Act | publisher=The Wall Street Journal | date=June 25, 2010 | accessdate=July 22, 2010 | first=Damian | last=Paletta | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724182636/http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/06/25/it-has-a-name-the-doddfrank-act/ | archivedate=July 24, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the finalized bill emerged from conference, President Obama said that it included 90 percent of the reforms he had proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Obama B. (June 25, 2010). [http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-wall-street-reform-1 Remarks by the President on Wall Street Reform] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723023509/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-wall-street-reform-1 |date=2010-07-23 }}. White House.&lt;/ref&gt; Major components of Obama's original proposal, listed by the order in which they appear in the "A New Foundation" outline,&lt;ref name=ObamaProposal/&gt; include:
# The consolidation of regulatory agencies, elimination of the national thrift charter, and new oversight council to evaluate systemic risk;
# Comprehensive regulation of financial markets, including increased transparency of [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] (bringing them onto [[Exchange (organized market)|exchanges]]);
# Consumer protection reforms including a new consumer protection agency and uniform standards for "plain vanilla" products as well as strengthened investor protection;
# Tools for financial crisis, including a "resolution regime" complementing the existing [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) authority to allow for orderly winding down of bankrupt firms, and including a proposal that the Federal Reserve (the "Fed") receive authorization from the Treasury for extensions of credit in "unusual or exigent circumstances";
# Various measures aimed at increasing international standards and cooperation including proposals related to improved accounting and tightened regulation of [[credit rating agencies]].

At President Obama's request, Congress later added the [[Volcker Rule]] to this proposal in January 2010.&lt;ref name=ObamaVolckerRule/&gt;

The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is categorized into sixteen titles and, by one law firm's count, it requires that regulators create 243 rules, conduct 67 studies, and issue 22 periodic reports.&lt;ref name=DavisPolkFinal&gt;Davis Polk.

The stated aim of the legislation is:

{{quote|To promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end "too big to fail", to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.&lt;ref name=THOMASWeb&gt;{{cite web | url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h4173enr.txt.pdf | title=Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Enrolled Final Version – HR 4173) | publisher=[[THOMAS]] | accessdate=July 20, 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007152515/http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h4173enr.txt.pdf | archivedate=October 7, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Act changes the existing regulatory structure, by creating a number of new agencies (while merging and removing others) in an effort to streamline the regulatory process, increasing oversight of specific institutions regarded as a systemic risk, amending the [[Federal Reserve Act]], promoting transparency, and additional changes. The Act's intentions are to provide rigorous standards and supervision to protect the economy and American consumers, investors and businesses; end taxpayer-funded [[bailout]]s of financial institutions; provide for an advanced warning system on the stability of the economy; create new rules on executive compensation and corporate governance; and eliminate certain loopholes that led to the 2008 economic recession.&lt;ref name=THOMASWebsummary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/FinancialReformSummaryAsFiled.pdf|title=Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010 – Summary|first=|last=|publisher=111th Congress|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206115932/http://www.banking.senate.gov/public/_files/FinancialReformSummaryAsFiled.pdf#|archivedate=2014-12-06|df=|access-date=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new agencies are either granted explicit power over a particular aspect of financial regulation, or that power is transferred from an existing agency. All of the new agencies, and some existing ones that are not currently required to do so, are also compelled to report to Congress on an annual (or biannual) basis, to present the results of current plans and explain future goals. Important new agencies created include the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]], the [[Office of Financial Research]], and the [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection]].

Of the existing agencies, changes are proposed, ranging from new powers to the transfer of powers in an effort to enhance the regulatory system. The institutions affected by these changes include most of the regulatory agencies currently involved in monitoring the financial system ([[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC), [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC), [[Federal Reserve]] (the "Fed"), the [[Securities Investor Protection Corporation]] (SIPC), etc.), and the final elimination of the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] (further described in [[#Title III – Transfer of Powers to the Comptroller, the FDIC, and the FED|Title III – Transfer of Powers to the Comptroller, the FDIC, and the FED]]).

As a practical matter, prior to the passage of Dodd–Frank, investment advisers were not required to register with the SEC if the investment adviser had fewer than 15 clients during the previous 12 months and did not hold itself out generally to the public as an investment adviser. The act eliminates that exemption, thereby rendering numerous additional investment advisers, hedge funds, and private equity firms subject to new registration requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://doddfrankregistration.com/overview/ |title=Dodd–Frank SEC Registration – An Overview |publisher=Allan J. P. Rooney, P.C.|date= December 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709160116/http://doddfrankregistration.com/overview/ |archivedate=July 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain [[non-bank financial institution]]s and their subsidiaries will be supervised by the Fed&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 161&lt;/ref&gt; in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were a bank holding company.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} §§ 162(a),163&lt;/ref&gt;

To the extent that the Act affects all federal financial regulatory agencies, eliminating one (the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]]) and creating two (Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research) in addition to several consumer protection agencies, including the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, this legislation in many ways represents a change in the way America's financial markets will operate in the future. Few provisions of the Act became effective when the bill was signed.&lt;ref name=schedule&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2010/07/15/summary-and-implementation-schedule-of-the-dodd-frank-act/ | title=Summary and Implementation Schedule of the Dodd–Frank Act | publisher=The Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation | date=July 15, 2010 | accessdate=July 25, 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719182705/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2010/07/15/summary-and-implementation-schedule-of-the-dodd-frank-act/ | archivedate=July 19, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
{{Split section | Provisions of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act |date=March 2017}}

===Title I – Financial Stability===
Title I, or the "Financial Stability Act of 2010",&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 101&lt;/ref&gt; outlines two new agencies tasked to monitor [[systemic risk]] and research the state of the economy and clarifies the comprehensive supervision of [[bank holding companies]] by the Federal Reserve.

Title I creates the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] (FSOC) and the [[Office of Financial Research]] (OFR) in the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]]. These two agencies are designed to work closely together. The Council is formed of 10 voting members, 9 of whom are federal regulators and 5 non-voting supporting members, to encourage interagency collaboration and knowledge transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 112(a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt; The Treasury Secretary is Chair of the Council, and the Head of the Financial Research Office is appointed by the President with confirmation from the Senate.

Title I introduced the ability to impose stricter regulations on certain institutions by classifying them as SIFI's ([[Systemically important financial institution#Non-bank entities|systemically important financial institutions]]); according to [[Paul Krugman]], this has allowed institutions to reduce risk-taking so they could to avoid such classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/half-a-loaf-financial-reform-edition/|quote=Should we have had a stiffer financial reform? Definitely — required capital ratios should be a lot higher than they are. But Dodd–Frank's rules — especially, I think, the prospect of being classed as a SIFI, a strategically important institution subject to tighter constraints, have had a real effect in reducing risk.|title=Half A Loaf, Financial Reform Edition|date=2016-02-03|author=Paul Krugman|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823211101/https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/half-a-loaf-financial-reform-edition/|archivedate=2017-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under section 165d, certain institutions must prepare resolution plans (so-called "living wills"), the first round of which was rejected by the Federal Reserve System in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20140805a.htm|title=Agencies Provide Feedback on Second Round Resolution Plans of "First-Wave" Filers: Firms required to address shortcomings in 2015 submissions|author=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|quote=Each plan, commonly known as a living will, must describe the company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company. The 11 firms in the first group of filers include [[Bank of America]], [[Bank of New York Mellon]], [[Barclays]], [[Citigroup]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Morgan Stanley]], [[State Street Corp.]], and [[UBS]]. [...] The Federal Reserve Board determined that the 11 banking organizations must take immediate action to improve their resolvability and reflect those improvements in their 2015 plans.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913013522/http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20140805a.htm|archivedate=2016-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The process can be seen as a way to regulate and reduce [[shadow banking]] activities by banking institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rooseveltforward.org/sanders-clinton-approach-shadow-banking/|title=How Sanders and Clinton Each Approach Shadow Banking|author=Mike Konczal|date=2016-07-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002195306/http://rooseveltforward.org/sanders-clinton-approach-shadow-banking/|archivedate=2016-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Financial Stability Oversight Council ====
The Financial Stability Oversight Council is tasked to identify threats to the financial stability of the United States, promote [[market discipline]], and respond to emerging risks in order to stabilize the United States financial system. At a minimum, it must meet quarterly.

The Council is required to report to Congress on the state of the financial system, and may direct the [[Office of Financial Research]] to conduct research.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 112(a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Notable powers include:
# With a 2/3 vote, it may place nonbank financial companies or domestic subsidiaries of international banks under the supervision of the Federal Reserve if it appears that these companies could pose a threat to the financial stability of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 113&lt;/ref&gt;
# Under certain circumstances, the Council may provide for more stringent regulation of a financial activity by issuing recommendations to the primary financial regulatory agency, which the primary financial agency is obliged to implement – the Council reports to Congress on the implementation or failure to implement such recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 120&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Council may require any bank or non-bank financial institution with assets over $50 billion to submit certified financial reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 116&lt;/ref&gt;
# With the approval of the Council, the Federal Reserve may promulgate safe harbor regulations to exempt certain types of foreign banks from regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 170&lt;/ref&gt;

====Office of Financial Research====
The Office of Financial Research is designed to support the Financial Stability Oversight Council through data collection and research. The Director has [[Administrative subpoena|subpoena]] power and may require from any financial institution (bank or non-bank) any data needed to carry out the functions of the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 152(f)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Office can also issue guidelines to standardizing the way data is reported, constituent agencies have three years to implement data standardization guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 153&lt;/ref&gt;

It is intended to be self-funded through the Financial Research Fund within 2 years of enactment, with the Federal Reserve providing funding in the initial interim period.&lt;ref name="§ 155"&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 155&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ways, the Office of Financial Research is to be operated without the constraints of the [[Civil service#United States|Civil Service]] system. For example, it does not need to follow federal pay scale guidelines (see above), and it is mandated that the office have workforce development plans&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 156&lt;/ref&gt; that are designed to ensure that it can attract and retain technical talent, which it is required to report about Congressional committees for its first 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 156(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title II – Orderly Liquidation Authority===
{{Main|Bankruptcy in the United States}}
[[File:Lehman Brothers Times Square by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|The New York City headquarters of [[Lehman Brothers]] at the time of its collapse in 2008.]]
Before Dodd–Frank, federal laws to handle the [[liquidation]] and [[receivership]] of federally regulated banks existed for supervised banks, insured depository institutions, and securities companies by the FDIC or [[Securities Investor Protection Corporation]] (SIPC). Dodd–Frank expanded these laws to potentially handle insurance companies and non-bank financial companies, and changed these liquidation laws in certain ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 201&lt;/ref&gt; Once it is determined that a financial company satisfied the criteria for liquidation, if the financial company's board of directors does not agree, provisions are made for judicial appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 202&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the type of financial institution, different regulatory organizations may jointly or independently, by 2/3 vote, determine whether a receiver should be appointed for a financial company:&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 203(a)(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In General – FDIC and/or the [[Federal Reserve]]
* Broker Dealers – SEC and/or the Federal Reserve
* Insurance Companies – [[Federal Insurance Office]] (part of the Treasury Department and [[#Subtitle A: Federal Insurance Office|established in this Act]]) and/or the Federal Reserve

Provided that the Secretary of Treasury, in consultation with the President, may also determine to appoint a receiver for a financial company.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 203(b)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) shall review and report to Congress about the Secretary's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 203(c)(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

When a financial institution is placed into receivership under these provisions, within 24 hours, the Secretary shall report to Congress. Also, within 60 days, there shall be a report to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 203(c)&lt;/ref&gt; The report on recommending to place a financial company into receivership shall contain various details on the state of the company, the impact of its default on the company, and the proposed action.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 203(a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

====FDIC liquidation====
[[File:Seal of the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.svg|thumb|150px|The FDIC is the liquidator for most such financial institutions as failed banks.]]
Unless otherwise stated, the FDIC is the liquidator for financial institutions who are not banking members (like the SIPC) nor [[insurance company|insurance companies]] (such as the FDIC). In taking action under this title, the FDIC shall comply with various requirements:&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 206&lt;/ref&gt;
* determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States, and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company
* ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Funds are fully paid
* ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions
* ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed (if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the Corporation is appointed receiver)
* ensure that the members of the board of directors (or body performing similar functions) responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company are removed, if such members have not already been removed at the time the Corporation is appointed as receiver
* not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary.

====Orderly Liquidation Fund====
To the extent that the Act expanded the scope of financial firms that may be liquidated by the federal government, beyond the existing authorities of the FDIC and SIPC, there had to be an additional source of funds, independent of the FDIC's [[Deposit Insurance Fund]], used in case of a non-bank or non-security financial company's liquidation. The Orderly Liquidation Fund is to be an FDIC-managed fund, to be used by the FDIC in the event of a covered financial company's liquidation&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 210(n)(1)&lt;/ref&gt; that is not covered by FDIC or SIPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 210(n)(8)(A)&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the Fund is to be capitalized over a period no shorter than five years, but no longer than ten; however, in the event the FDIC must make use of the Fund before it is fully capitalized, the Secretary of the Treasury and the FDIC are permitted to extend the period as determined necessary.&lt;ref name=THOMASWeb /&gt; The method of capitalization is by collecting risk-based assessment fees on any "eligible financial company" – which is defined as "[...] any bank holding company with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50 billion and any nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors". The severity of the assessment fees can be adjusted on an as-needed basis (depending on economic conditions and other similar factors) and the relative size and value of a firm is to play a role in determining the fees to be assessed.&lt;ref name=THOMASWeb /&gt; The eligibility of a financial company to be subject to the fees is periodically reevaluated; or, in other words, a company that does not qualify for fees in the present, will be subject to the fees in the future if they cross the 50 billion line, or become subject to Federal Reserve scrutiny.&lt;ref name=THOMASWeb /&gt;

To the extent that a covered financial company has a negative net worth and its liquidation creates an obligation to the FDIC as its liquidator, the FDIC shall charge one or more risk-based assessment such that the obligation will be paid off within 60 months (5 years) of the issuance of the obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 210(o)(1)(B)&lt;/ref&gt; The assessments will be charged to any bank holding company with consolidated assets greater than $50 billion and any nonbank financial company supervised by the Federal Reserve. Under certain conditions, the assessment may be extended to regulated banks and other financial institutions.&lt;ref name="Office of the Whistleblower"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129074231/http://www.sec.gov/whistleblower |archivedate=2013-11-29 |df= }}, Office of the Whistleblower.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessments will be implemented according to a matrix that the Financial Stability Oversight Council recommends to the FDIC. The matrix shall take into account:&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 210(o)(4)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Economic conditions – higher assessments during more favorable economic conditions
* Whether the institution is:
** an insured depositary institution that is a member of the FDIC
** a member of the SIPC
** an insured credit union
** an insurance company, assessed pursuant to applicable state law to cover costs of rehabilitation or liquidation
* strength of its balance sheet, both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, and its leverage
* relevant market share
* potential exposure to sudden calls on liquidity precipitated by economic distress with, other financial companies;
* the amount, maturity, volatility, and stability of the liabilities of the company, including the degree of reliance on short-term funding, taking into consideration existing systems for measuring a company's risk-based capital
* the stability and variety of the company's sources of funding
* the company's importance as a source of credit for households, businesses, and state and local governments and as a source of liquidity for the financial system;
* the extent to which assets are simply managed and not owned by the financial company and the extent to which ownership of assets under management is diffuse
* the amount, different categories, and concentrations of liabilities, both insured and uninsured, contingent and non-contingent, including both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liabilities, of the financial company and its affiliates

====Obligation limit and funding====
When liquidating a financial company under this title (as opposed to FDIC or SIPD) there is a maximum limit of the Government's liquidation obligation, i.e., the Government's obligation can not exceed:&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 210(n)(6)&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10% of the total consolidated assets, or
* 90% of the fair value of the total consolidated assets

In the event that the Fund and other sources of capital are insufficient, the FDIC is authorized to buy and sell securities on behalf of the company (or companies) in receivership to raise additional capital.&lt;ref name=THOMASWeb /&gt; Taxpayers shall bear no losses from liquidating any financial company under this title and any losses shall be the responsibility of the financial sector, recovered through assessments:&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 214&lt;/ref&gt;
* Liquidation is Required for all financial companies put into receivership under this title
* All funds expended in the liquidation of a financial company under this title shall be recovered from the disposition of assets or assessments on the financial sector

====Orderly Liquidation Authority Panel====
Established inside the [[United States Bankruptcy Court|U.S. Bankruptcy Court]] for the District of Delaware, the Panel is tasked with evaluating the conclusion of the Secretary of Treasury that a company is in (or in danger of) default. The Panel consists of three bankruptcy judges drawn from the District of Delaware, all of whom are appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In his appointments, the Chief Judge is instructed to weigh the financial expertise of the candidates.&lt;ref name=THOMASWeb /&gt; If the Panel concurs with the Secretary, the company in question is permitted to be placed into [[receivership]]; if they do not concur, the Secretary has an opportunity to amend and refile his or her petition.&lt;ref name=THOMASWeb /&gt; In the event that a Panel decision is appealed, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] has jurisdiction; in the event of further appeal, a [[writ of certiorari]] may be filed with the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]]. In all appellate events, the scope of review is limited to whether the decision of the Secretary that a company is in (or in danger of) default is supported by substantial evidence.&lt;ref name=THOMASWeb /&gt;

=== Title III – Transfer of Powers to the Comptroller, the FDIC, and the Fed ===
Title III, or the "Enhancing Financial Institution Safety and Soundness Act of 2010",&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 300&lt;/ref&gt; is designed to streamline banking regulation. Also, it is intended to reduce competition and overlaps between different regulators by abolishing the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] and transferring its power over the appropriate holding companies to the Board of Governors of the [[Federal Reserve System]], state savings associations to the FDIC, and other thrifts to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 312&lt;/ref&gt; The thrift charter is to remain, although weakened. Additional changes include:
* The amount of [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation#Historical insurance limits|deposits insured by the FDIC]] and the [[National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund]] (NCUSIF) is permanently increased from $100–250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 335&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2010/pr10161.html|title=FDIC: Press Releases - PR-161-2010 7/21/2010|website=www.fdic.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215174007/http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2010/pr10161.html|archivedate=2011-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each of the financial regulatory agencies represented on the Council shall establish an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion that shall be responsible for all matters of the agency in relation to diversity in management, employment, and business activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 342&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title IV – Regulation of Advisers to Hedge Funds and Others===
Title IV, or the "Private Fund Investment Advisers Registration Act of 2010",&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 401&lt;/ref&gt; requires certain previously exempt investment advisers to register as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''Regulation of Investment Advisers'', §§1:1, 1:31–1:32, 1:35–1:39 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, it requires many hedge fund managers and private equity fund managers to register as advisers for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, Lins, Hoenig and Rube, ''Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds: Regulation and Compliance'', §§3:2–3:8 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the act increases the reporting requirements of investment advisors as well as limiting these advisors' ability to exclude information in reporting to many of the federal government agencies.

===Title V – Insurance===
Title V - Insurance is split into two subtitles: A.) Federal Insurance Office, and B.) State-Based Insurance Reform.

====Subtitle A – Federal Insurance Office====
Subtitle A, also called the "Federal Insurance Office Act of 2010",&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 501&lt;/ref&gt; establishes the Federal Insurance Office within the Treasury Department, which is tasked with:&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 502: Subchapter I of chapter 3 of subtitle I of [[title 31, United States Code]], is amended—(1) by redesignating section 312 as section 315; (2) by redesignating section 313 as section 312; and (3) by inserting: Sec 313 Federal Insurance Office&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry (except health insurance, some long-term care insurance, and crop insurance), including the identification of gaps in regulation of insurers that could contribute to financial crisis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://image.edistribution.pwc.com/lib/fe9a13707565017971/m/1/FS+Reg+Brief+Insurance+FIO+secure.pdf|title= Insurers: Is federal regulation coming? |website=www.pwc.com|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice|date= December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monitoring the extent to which traditionally under-served communities and consumers, minorities, and low-and moderate-income persons have access to affordable insurance (except health insurance)
* Making recommendations to the Financial Stability Oversight Council about insurers that may pose a risk, and to help any state regulators with national issues
* Administering the Terrorism Insurance Program
* Coordinating international insurance matters
* Determining whether state insurance measure are preempted by covered agreements (states may have more stringent requirements)
* Consulting with the states (including state insurance regulators) regarding insurance matters of national importance and prudential insurance matters of international importance;

The Office is headed by a director appointed for a career-reserved term by the Secretary of the Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 501; Subchapter I of chapter 3 of subtitle I of [[title 31, United States Code]], added Sec 313(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the Insurance Office may require any insurer company to submit such data as may be reasonably required in carrying out the functions of the Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 501; Subchapter I of chapter 3 of subtitle I of [[title 31, United States Code]], added Sec 313(e)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

A state insurance measure shall be preempted if, and only to the extent that the Director determines that the measure results in a less favorable treatment of a non-US insurer whose parent corporation is located in a nation with an agreement or treaty with the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 501; Subchapter I of chapter 3 of subtitle I of [[title 31, United States Code]], added Sec 313(f)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtitle B – State-Based Insurance Reform====
Subtitle B, also called the "[[Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 511&lt;/ref&gt; applies to nonadmitted insurance and [[reinsurance]]. Regarding to nonadmitted insurance, the Act provides that the placement of nonadmitted insurance will only be subject to the statutory and regulatory requirements of the insured's home state, and that no state, other than the insured's home state, may require a surplus lines broker to be licensed to sell, solicit, or negotiate nonadmitted insurance respecting the insured.&lt;ref&gt;15 USC 8202(a)and (b)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act also provides that no state, other than the insured's home state, may require any premium tax payment for nonadmitted insurance.&lt;ref&gt;15 USC 8201(a)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, states may enter into a compact or otherwise establish procedures to allocate among the states the premium taxes paid to an insured's home state.&lt;ref&gt;15 USC 8201(b)&lt;/ref&gt;  A state may not collect any fees in relation to the licensing of an individual or entity as a surplus lines broker in the state unless that state has in effect by July 21, 2012 laws or regulations providing for participation by the state in the [[National Association of Insurance Commissioners|NAIC]]'s national insurance producer database, or any other equivalent uniform national database, for the licensure of surplus lines brokers and the renewal of these licenses.&lt;ref&gt;15 USC 8203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title VI – Improvements to Regulation===
{{main|Volcker Rule}}

====Provisions====
Title VI, or the "Bank and Savings Association Holding Company and Depository Institution Regulatory Improvements Act of 2010",&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 601&lt;/ref&gt; introduces the so-called "[[Volcker Rule]]" after former [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]] [[Paul Volcker]] by amending the [[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]]. With aiming to reduce the amount of speculative investments on the balance sheets of large firms, it limits banking entities to owning no more than 3% in a hedge fund or [[private equity fund]] of the total ownership interest.&lt;ref name="Whitehouse-1"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-calls-new-restrictions-size-and-scope-financial-institutions-rein-e|accessdate=February 27, 2010|title=President Obama Calls for New Restrictions on Size and Scope of Financial Institutions to Rein in Excesses and Protect Taxpayers|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220232336/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-calls-new-restrictions-size-and-scope-financial-institutions-rein-e|archivedate=February 20, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the banking entity's interests in hedge funds or private equity funds cannot exceed 3% of the banking entity's Tier 1 capital. Furthermore, no bank with a direct or indirect relationship with a hedge fund or private equity fund "may enter into a transaction with the fund, or with any other hedge fund or private equity fund that is controlled by such fund" without disclosing the relationship's full extent to the regulating entity, and assuring that there is no [[conflict of interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 619 amends 12 U.S.C § 1841, § 13(f)&lt;/ref&gt; "Banking entity" includes an insured depository institution, any company controlling an insured depository institution, and such a company's affiliates and subsidiaries. Also, it must comply with the Act within two years of its passing, although it may apply for time extensions. Responding to the Volcker Rule and anticipating of its ultimate impact, several commercial banks and investment banks operating as bank holding companies have already begun downsizing or disposing their proprietary trading desks.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, Lins, Hoenig and Rube, ''Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds: Regulation and Compliance'', §17:10 (Thomson West, 2103 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule distinguishes transactions by banking entities from transactions by nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mofo.com/files/Uploads/Images/VolckerChart.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=July 22, 2010 |title=The Volcker Rule Provisions |publisher=[[Morrison &amp; Foerster]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229121055/http://www.mofo.com/files/Uploads/Images/VolckerChart.pdf |archivedate=December 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rule states that generally, "an insured depository institution may not purchase an asset from, or sell an asset to, an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of the insured depository institution, or any related interest of such person ... unless— the transaction is on market terms; and if the transaction represents more than 10 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution, the transaction has been approved in advance by a majority of the members of the board of directors of the insured depository institution who do not have an interest in the transaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 615&lt;/ref&gt; Providing for the regulation of capital, the Volcker Rule says that regulators are required to impose upon institutions capital requirements that are "countercyclical, so that the amount of capital required to be maintained by a company increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction", to ensure the safety and soundness of the organization.&lt;ref name=skaddenvolcker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 616&lt;/ref&gt; The rule also provides that an insured state bank may engage in a derivative transaction only if the law with respect to lending limits of the state in which the insured state bank is chartered takes into consideration credit exposure to derivative transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 611&lt;/ref&gt; The title provides for a three-year moratorium on approving FDIC deposit insurance received after November 23, 2009, for an industrial bank, a credit card bank, or a trust bank either directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a commercial firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 603&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with section 1075 of the law, payment card networks must allow merchants to establish a minimum dollar amount for customers using payment cards, as long as the minimum is no higher than $10.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1075&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title VII – Wall Street Transparency and Accountability===
[[File:Photos NewYork1 032.jpg|right|thumb|The [[New York Stock Exchange]], the world's largest stock exchange by [[market capitalization]]]]
Title VII, also called the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 701&lt;/ref&gt; concerns regulation of [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter swaps]] markets.&lt;ref name=RegReset2010&gt;{{cite report |author=Dechert LLP |title=The Regulatory Reset of the OTC Derivatives Markets |url=http://www.dechert.com/files/Publication/6bde59c4-616f-4337-baa4-d4aa304cfc9a/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/ae071cb5-bae5-4344-9bf2-d95f792f5d4f/FS_17_07-10_Dodd-Frank_The_Regulatory_Reset.pdf |format=PDF |date=July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507053113/http://www.dechert.com/files/Publication/6bde59c4-616f-4337-baa4-d4aa304cfc9a/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/ae071cb5-bae5-4344-9bf2-d95f792f5d4f/FS_17_07-10_Dodd-Frank_The_Regulatory_Reset.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This section includes the [[credit default swaps]] and [[credit derivative]] that were the subject of several bank failures c. 2007.

The [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) and the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) both regulate derivatives known as swaps under the Act, but the SEC has authority over "security-based swaps".

{{main|Investor Protection and Securities Reform Act of 2010}}

[[File:US-SecuritiesAndExchangeCommission-Seal.svg|thumb|150px|SEC]]
Title IX, sections 901 to 991, known as the "Investor Protections and Improvements to the Regulation of Securities",&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 901&lt;/ref&gt; revises the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]'s powers and structure, as well as credit rating organizations and the relationships between customers and [[broker-dealer]]s or investment advisers. This title calls for various studies and reports from the SEC and [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO). This title contains ten subtitles, lettered A through J.

====Subtitle A – Increasing Investor Protection====
Subtitle A contains provisions:
* To prevent [[regulatory capture]] within the SEC and increase the influence of investors, the Act creates an [[Office of the Investor Advocate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 915; amending section 4 of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{USC|15|78d}}) by adding: (g) OFFICE OF THE INVESTOR ADVOCATE.&lt;/ref&gt; an Investor Advisory Committee composed of 12–22 members of whom serve four-year terms,&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 911; amending Title I of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{Usctc|15|2B}}) by adding Sec 39(a): Investors Advisory Committee&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[ombudsman]] appointed by the Office of the Investor Advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 919D; amending section 4(g) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] (as added by section 914) by adding: (8) OMBUDSMAN.&lt;/ref&gt; The Investor Advisory Committee was actually created in 2009 and therefore, it predates the Act's passage. However, it is specifically authorized under the Act.&lt;ref name="SkaddenCommentary"/&gt;
* SEC is specifically authorized to issue "point-of-sale disclosure" rules when retail investors purchase investment products or services; these disclosures include concise information on costs, risks, and conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name=SkaddenCommentary/&gt;{{rp|160–1}} This authorization follows up the SEC's failure to implement proposed point-of-sale disclosure rules between 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;For the 2005 proposed rule, see [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/33-8544.htm Point of Sale Disclosure Requirements and Confirmation Requirements for Transactions in Mutual Funds, College Savings Plans, and Certain Other Securities, and Amendments to the Registration Form for Mutual Funds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504144743/https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/33-8544.htm |date=2017-05-04 }}, via sec.gov&lt;/ref&gt; These proposed rules generated opposition because they were perceived as burdensome to broker-dealers. For example, they would require oral disclosures for telephone transactions; they were not satisfied by cheap internet or email disclosures, and they could allow the customer to request disclosures specific to the amount of their investment. To determine the disclosure rules, the Act authorizes the SEC to perform "investor testing" and to rely on experts to study financial literacy among retail investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 912; adding to Section 19 of the [[Securities Act of 1933]] ({{USC|15|77s}}) by adding (e)Evaluation of Rules or Programs&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtitle A provides authority for the SEC to impose regulations requiring "[[fiduciary duty]]" by broker-dealers to their customers.&lt;ref name=SkaddenCommentary/&gt;{{rp|158}} Although the Act does not create such a duty immediately, it does authorize the SEC to establish a standard. It also requires the SEC to study the [[standards of care]] that broker-dealers and investment advisers apply to their customers and to report to Congress on the results within 6 months.&lt;ref name=SkaddenCommentary/&gt; Under the law, commission and limited product range would not violate the duty and broker-dealers would not have a continuing duty after receiving the investment advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 913(g); amending section 15 of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{USC|15|78o}}) by adding at the end: (k) STANDARD OF CONDUCT&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtitle B – Increasing Regulatory Enforcement and Remedies====
Subtitle B gives the SEC further powers of enforcement, including a "whistleblower bounty program"&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 922; The [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{Usctc|15|2B}}) by inserting: SEC. 21F. SECURITIES WHISTLEBLOWER INCENTIVES AND PROTECTION.&lt;/ref&gt; which is partially based upon the successful "qui tam" provisions of the 1986 Amendments to the False Claims Act as well as an IRS whistleblower reward program Congress created in 2006. The SEC program rewards individuals providing information resulting in an SEC enforcement action in which more than $1 million in sanctions is ordered.&lt;ref name="Office of the Whistleblower"/&gt; Whistleblower rewards range from 10-30% of the recovery. The law also provides job protections for SEC whistleblowers and promises confidentiality for them.&lt;ref name="SEC and CFTC whistleblower programs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phillipsandcohen.com/SEC-Whistleblowers/SEC-and-CFTC-whistleblower-info.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210132434/http://www.phillipsandcohen.com/SEC-Whistleblowers/SEC-and-CFTC-whistleblower-info.shtml |archivedate=2014-02-10 |df= }}, SEC and CFTC whistleblower programs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 921I controversially limited [[Freedom of information in the United States|FOIA]]'s applicability to the SEC,&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, §  929I. PROTECTING CONFIDENTIALITY OF MATERIALS SUBMITTED TO THE COMMISSION; (a) SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.—Section 24 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78x) is amended— (1) in subsection (d), by striking ''subsection (e)'' and inserting ''subsection (f)''; (2) by redesignating subsection (e) as subsection (f); and (3) by inserting after subsection (d) the following: ''(e) RECORDS OBTAINED FROM REGISTERED PERSONS''&lt;/ref&gt; a change partially repealed a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Obama signs bill revoking SEC FOIA carve-outs|url = http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2010/10/obama-signs-bill-revoking-sec-foia-carve-outs-029730|website = POLITICO|access-date = 2016-01-25|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160129164505/http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2010/10/obama-signs-bill-revoking-sec-foia-carve-outs-029730|archivedate = 2016-01-29|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC had previously used a narrower existing exemption for trade secrets when refusing Freedom of Information Requests.&lt;ref&gt;Scannell, Kara "SEC Gets FOIA Foil in Financial Law" Wall Street Journal, July 31, 2010, p B3&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtitle C – Improvements to the Regulation of Credit Rating Agencies====
Recognizing credit ratings that credit rating agencies had issued, including [[nationally recognized statistical rating organization]]s (NRSROs), are matters of national public interest, that credit rating agencies are critical "gatekeepers" in the debt market central to capital formation, investor confidence, and the efficient performance of the United States economy, Congress expanded regulation of credit rating agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 931(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtitle C cites findings of conflicts of interest and inaccuracies during the recent financial crisis contributed significantly to the mismanagement of risks by financial institutions and investors, which in turn adversely impacted the US economy as factors necessitating increased accountability and transparency by credit rating agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 931(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtitle C mandates the creation by the SEC of an Office of Credit Ratings (OCR) to provide oversight over NRSROs and enhanced regulation of such entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 932(p)&lt;/ref&gt;

Enhanced regulations of [[nationally recognized statistical rating organization]]s (NRSROs) include:
* NRSROs are required to establish, maintain, enforce and document an effective internal control structure governing the implementation of and adherence to policies, procedures, and methodologies for determining credit ratings.&lt;ref name="USBill|111|HR|4173"/&gt;
* Submit to the OCR an annual internal control report.
* Adhere to rules established by the Commission to prevent sales and marketing considerations from influencing the ratings issued by a NRSRO.
* Policies and procedures with regard to (1) certain employment transitions to avoid conflicts of interest, (2) the processing of complaints regarding NRSRO noncompliance, and (3) notification to users of identified significant errors are required.
* Compensation of the compliance officer may not be linked to the financial performance of the NRSRO.
* The duty to report to appropriate authorities credible allegations of unlawful conduct by issuers of securities.&lt;ref name="USBill|111|HR|4173"/&gt;
* The consideration of credible information about an issuer from sources other than the issuer or underwriter that is potentially significant to a rating decision.
* The Act establishes corporate governance, organizational, and management of conflict of interest guidelines. A minimum of 2 independent directors is required.&lt;ref name="USBill|111|HR|4173"/&gt;

Subtitle C grants the Commission some authority to either temporarily suspend or permanently revoke the registration of an NRSRO respecting a particular class or subclass of securities if after noticing and hearing that the NRSRO lacks the resources to produce credit ratings with integrity.&lt;ref name="USBill|111|HR|4173"&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 932&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional key provisions of the Act are:
* The Commission shall prescribe rules with respect to credit rating procedures and methodologies.
* OCR is required to conduct an examination of each NRSRO at least annually and shall produce a public inspection report.
* To facilitate transparency of credit ratings performance, the Commission shall require NRSROs to publicly disclose information on initial and revised credit ratings issued, including the credit rating methodology utilized and data relied on, to enable users to evaluate NRSROs.

Moreover, Subtitle C requires the SEC to conduct a study on strengthening the NRSRO's independence, and it recommends the organization to utilize its rulemaking authority to establish guidelines preventing improper conflicts of interest arising from the performance of services unrelated to the issuance of credit ratings such as consulting, advisory, and other services.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 939C&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act requires the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a study on alternative business models for compensating NRSROs&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 939E&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtitle D – Improvements to the Asset-Backed Securitization Process====
In Subtitle D, the term "Asset-Backed Security" is defined as a fixed-income or other security collateralized by any self-liquidating financial asset, such as a loan, lease, mortgage, allowing the owner of the Asset-Backed Security to receive payments depending on the cash flow of the (ex.) loan. For regulation purposes, Asset-Backed Securities include (but are not limited to):&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 941; amending section 3(a) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{USC|15|78c(a)}}) by adding: (77) ASSET-BACKED SECURITY&lt;/ref&gt;
* collateralized mortgage obligation
* collateralized debt obligation (CDOs)
* collateralized bond obligation
* collateralized debt obligation of asset-backed securities
* collateralized debt obligation of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs Squared)

The law required credit risk retention regulations (where 5% of the risk was retained) within nine months of enactment,.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 941; amending section 3(a) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{USC|15|78c(a)}}) by adding: (15G) Credit Risk Retention&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals had been highly criticized due to restrictive definitions on "qualified residential mortgages" with restrictive down-payment and debt-to-income requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/banking-financial-institutions/319145-regulators-revamp-risk-retention-proposal Regulators overhaul risk-retention proposal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011152456/http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/banking-financial-institutions/319145-regulators-revamp-risk-retention-proposal |date=2013-10-11 }}. ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the August 2013 proposal, the 20% down-payment requirement was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/washingtonbureau/2013/08/28/regulators-drop-20-down-payment.html Regulators drop 20%-down requirement from mortgage proposal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928081041/http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/washingtonbureau/2013/08/28/regulators-drop-20-down-payment.html |date=2013-09-28 }}. ''Bizjournals''.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, six federal agencies (Fed, OCC, FDIC, SEC, FHFA, and HUD) finalized their joint asset-backed securities rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/risk-detention-dodd-frank.pdf |title= First take: Ten key points from the final risk retention rule |website= www.pwc.com |publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice |date= October 2014 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141231002407/http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/risk-detention-dodd-frank.pdf |archivedate= 2014-12-31 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations for assets that are:
* Residential in Nature – are jointly prescribed by the SEC, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency
* In General – the federal banking agencies and the SEC

Specifically, securitizers are:
* prohibited from hedging or transferring the credit risk it is required to retain with respect to the assets
* required to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk for an asset that is not a qualified residential mortgage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kider|first=Mitchel (with Michael Kieval &amp; Leslie Sowers)|title=Consumer Protection and Mortgage Regulation Under Dodd–Frank|year=2011|publisher=West|isbn=978-0-314-93736-0|page=540|url=http://west.thomson.com/productdetail/178928/41127984/productdetail.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* for commercial mortgages or other types of assets, regulations may provide for retention of less than 5% of the credit risk, provided that there is also disclosure

The regulations are to prescribe several asset classes with separate rules for securitizers, including (but are not limited to) residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and auto loans. Both the SEC and the federal banking agencies may jointly issue exemptions, exceptions, and adjustments to the rules issues provided that they:&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 941; amending section 3(a) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{USC|15|78c(a)}}) by adding: (15G)(e) Exemptions, Exceptions and Adjustments&lt;/ref&gt;
* help ensure high quality underwriting standards for the securitizers and originators of assets that are securitized or available for securitization
* encourage appropriate risk management practices by the securitizers and originators of assets, improve the access of consumers and businesses to credit on reasonable terms, or otherwise be in the public interest and for the protection of investors.
Additionally, the following institutions and programs are exempt:
* Farm Credit System
* Qualified Residential Mortgages (which are to be jointly defined by the federal banking agencies, SEC, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency)

The SEC may classify issuers and prescribe requirements appropriate for each class of issuers of asset-backed securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 942; replacing section 15(d) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{USC|15|78o(d)}}) with a new subsection.&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC must also adopt regulations requiring each issuer of an asset-backed security to disclose, for each [[tranche]] or class of security, information that will help identify each asset backing that security.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 942; amending section 7 of the [[Securities Act of 1933]] ({{USC|15|77}}) by adding: ''(c) DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.''&lt;/ref&gt; Within six months of enactment, the SEC must issue regulations prescribing representations and warranties in the marketing of asset-backed securities:&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 942&lt;/ref&gt;
* require each [[Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization]] to include in any report accompanying a credit rating a description of:
** the representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms available to investors
** how they differ from the representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms in issuances of similar securities
* require any securitizer to disclose fulfilled and unfulfilled repurchase requests across all trusts aggregated by the securitizer, so that investors may identify asset originators with clear underwriting deficiencies.

The SEC shall also prescribe a [[Due Diligence]] analysis/review of the assets underlying the security, and a disclosure of that analysis.

====Subtitle E – Accountability and Executive Compensation====
Within one year of enactment, the SEC must issue rules directing the national securities exchanges and associations to prohibit the listing of any security of an issuer not in compliance of the requirements of the compensation sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 951; amending the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{USC|15|78}} et seq.) by inserting: SEC. 10C. COMPENSATION COMMITTEES. (f) Commission Rules&lt;/ref&gt; At least once every three years, a public corporation is required to submit the approval of executive compensation to a shareholder vote. And once every six years, there should be a submitted to shareholder vote whether the required approval of executive compensation should be usually that once every three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 951; amending the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{Usctc|15|2B}}) by inserting: SEC. 14A. SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION&lt;/ref&gt; Shareholders may disapprove any [[Golden Parachute]] compensation to executives via a non-binding vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/070110_Dodd_Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_comprehensive_summary_Final.pdf | format=PDF | title=Brief Summary of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act | accessdate=August 1, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710034423/http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/070110_Dodd_Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_comprehensive_summary_Final.pdf# | archivedate=2010-07-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shareholders must be informed of the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the issuer, taking into account any change in the value of the shares of stock and dividends of the issuer and any distributions&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 953; amending section 14 of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{USC|15|78n}}), by adding: (i) DISCLOSURE OF PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as:&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 953(d); amending {{USCFR|17|229|402}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the issuer, except the chief executive officer (or any equivalent position)
* the annual total compensation of the chief executive officer, or any equivalent position
* the ratio of the amount of the median of the annual total with the total CEO compensation

The company must also disclose to shareholders whether any employee or member of the board of directors is permitted to purchase financial instruments designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of equity securities that are part of a compensation package.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 955; amending section 14 of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{USC|15|78n}}), by adding: (j) DISCLOSURE OF HEDGING BY EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Board of Director's Compensation Committee have to be independent in the board of directors, a compensation consultant or legal counsel, as provided by rules issued by the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 951; amending the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{USC|15|78}} et seq.) by inserting: SEC. 10C. COMPENSATION COMMITTEES.&lt;/ref&gt; Within 9 months of enacting this legislation, federal regulators shall proscribe regulations that a covered company must disclose to the appropriate Federal regulator, all incentive-based compensation arrangements with sufficient information such that the regulator may determine:&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 956&lt;/ref&gt;
* whether the compensation package could lead to material financial loss to the company
* provides the employee/officer with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits

====Subtitle F – Improvements to the Management of the Securities and Exchange Commission====
Subtitle F contains various managerial changes intended to increase and implement the agency's efficiency, including reports on [[internal control]]s, a triennial report on personnel management by the head of the GAO (the [[Comptroller General of the United States]]), a hotline for employees to report problems in the agency, a report by the GAO on the oversight of [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934#Securities associations|National Securities Associations]], and a report by a consultant on reform of the SEC. Under Subtitle J, the SEC will be funded through "match funding", which will in effect mean that its budget will be funded through filing fees.&lt;ref name=SkaddenCommentary/&gt;{{Rp|81}}

====Subtitle G – Strengthening Corporate Governance====
Subtitle G provides the SEC to issue rules and regulations including a requirement permitting a shareholder to use a company's proxy solicitation materials for nominating individuals to membership on the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 971; amending section 14(a) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{USC|15|78n(a)}})&lt;/ref&gt; The company is also required to inform investors regarding why the same person is to serve as the board of directors' chairman and its chief executive officer (CEO), or the reason that different individuals must serve as the board's chairman or CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 972; amending the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{Usctc|15|2B}}) by inserting SEC 14B. Corporate Governance&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtitle H – Municipal Securities====
This provision of the statute creates a guarantee of trust correlating a municipal advisor (who provide advice to state and local governments regarding investments)&lt;ref name="sec.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-162.htm |title=SEC Adopts Temporary Rule Requiring Municipal Advisors to Register With Agency; 2010-162; September 2, 2010 |publisher=Sec.gov |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2012-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228022557/http://sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-162.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with any municipal bodies providing services. Also, it alters the make-up of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB") and mandates that the Comptroller General conducts studies in relation to municipal disclosure and municipal markets. The new MSRB will be composed of fifteen individuals. Also, it will have the authority to regulate municipal advisors and will be permitted to charge fees regarding trade information. Furthermore, it is mandated that the Comptroller General makes several recommendations, which must be submitted to Congress within 24 months of enacting the law.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aba.com/RegReform/RR9_18.htm |title=RegReform: 9.18 Municipal Securities |publisher=Aba.com |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2012-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402003156/http://www.aba.com/RegReform/RR9_18.htm |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtitle I – Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, Portfolio Margining, and Other Matters====

====Subtitle A – Residential Mortgage Loan Organization Standards====
A "Residential Mortgage Originator" is defined as any person who either receives compensation for or represents to the public that they will take a residential loan application, assist a consumer in obtaining a loan, or negotiate terms for a loan. A residential Mortgage Originator is not a person who provides financing to an individual for the purchase of 3 or less&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.responsiblelending.org/mortgage-lending/policy-legislation/congress/Dodd-Frank-Summary-XIV-Subt-A-Ccomprehensivefinal.pdf|title=Summary of Key Provisions: Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub.

For any residential mortgage loan, no mortgage originator may receive compensation that varies based on the term of the loan, other than the principal amount. In general, the mortgage originator can only receive payment from the consumer, except as provided in rules that may be established by the Board. Additionally, the mortgage originator must verify the consumer's ability to pay. A violation of the "ability to repay" standard, or a mortgage that has excessive fees or abusive terms, may be raised as a foreclosure defense by a borrower against a lender without regard to any statute of limitations. The Act bans the payment of yield spread premiums or other originator compensation that is based on the interest rate or other terms of the loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1403; amending section 129B of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] (as added by section 1402(a)) by inserting: (c) PROHIBITION ON STEERING INCENTIVES&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtitle B – Minimum Standards for Mortgages====
In effect, this section of the Act establishes national underwriting standards for residential loans. It is not the intent of this section to establish rules or regulations that would require a loan to be made that would not be regarded as acceptable or prudential by the appropriate regulator of the financial institution. However, the loan originator shall make a reasonable and [[good faith effort]] based on verified and documented information that "at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to the terms, and all applicable taxes, insurance (including [[mortgage insurance|mortgage guarantee insurance]]), and other assessments". Also included in these calculations should be any payments for a [[second mortgage]] or other subordinate loans. Income verification is mandated for residential mortgages.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1411; amending chapter 2 of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] ({{USC|15|1631}} et seq.) by inserting: § 129C. Minimum standards for residential mortgage loans&lt;/ref&gt; Certain loan provisions, including prepayment penalties on some loans, and mandatory arbitration on all residential loans, are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1414; amending section 129C of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] by inserting: (c) PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN PREPAYMENT PENALTIES&lt;/ref&gt;

This section also defined a "Qualified Mortgage" as any residential mortgage loan that the regular periodic payments for the loan does not increase the principal balance or allow the consumer to defer repayment of principal (with some exceptions), and has points and fees being less than 3% of the loan amount. The Qualified Mortgage terms are important to the extent that the loan terms plus an "Ability to Pay" presumption create a [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] situation concerning certain technical provisions related to foreclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1412; amending section 129C of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] by inserting: (b) PRESUMPTION OF ABILITY TO REPAY&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtitle C – High-Cost Mortgages====
A "High-Cost Mortgage" as well as a [[reverse mortgage]] are sometimes referred to as "certain home mortgage transactions" in the Fed's [[Regulation Z]] (the regulation used to implement various sections of the [[Truth in Lending Act]]) High-Cost Mortgage is redefined as a "consumer credit transaction that is secured by the consumer's principal dwelling" (excluding reverse mortgages that are covered in separate sections), which include:&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1431; DEFINED.—Section 103(aa) of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] ({{USC|15|1602(aa))}} by striking all that precedes paragraph (2) and inserting: ''(aa) HIGH-COST MORTGAGE''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Credit Transactions secured by consumer's principal dwelling and interest rate is 6.5% more than the [[prime rate]] for comparable transactions
* subordinated (ex. [[second mortgage]]) if secured by consumer's principal dwelling and interest rate is 8.5% more than the [[prime rate]] for comparable transactions
* Points and Fees, excluding [[Mortgage Insurance]], if the transaction is:
** less than $20,000, total points and fees greater than 8% or $1000
** greater than $20,000, total points and fees greater than 6%
* under certain conditions, if the fees and points may be collected more than 36 months after loan is executed
New provisions for calculating adjustable rates as well as definitions for points and fees are also included.

When receiving a High-Cost mortgage, the consumer must obtain pre-loan counseling from a certified counselor.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1432; amending section 129 of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] ({{USC|15|1639)}} by inserting: (u) PRE-LOAN COUNSELING&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also stipulates there are additional "Requirements to Existing Residential Mortgages". The changes to existing contracts are:
* disallowing Balloon Payments&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1432; amending section 129(e) of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] ({{USC|15|1639(e)}}) is amended to read as follows: (e) NO BALLOON PAYMENTS.—No high-cost mortgage may contain a scheduled payment that is more than twice as large as the average of earlier scheduled payments. This subsection shall not apply when the payment schedule is adjusted to the seasonal or irregular income of the consumer.&lt;/ref&gt;
* disallowing prepayment penalties&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1432; amending section 129(c)(2) of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] ({{USC|15|1639(c)(2)}}) is hereby repealed&lt;/ref&gt;
* banning the practice of encouraging default on an existing loan when refinancing&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1432; amending section 129 of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] ({{USC|15|1639}}) is amended&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtitle D – Office of Housing Counseling====
Subtitle D, known as the [[Expand and Preserve Home Ownership Through Counseling Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1441&lt;/ref&gt; creates a new Office of Housing Counseling, within the department of [[Housing and Urban Development]]. The director reports to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The Director shall have primary responsibility within the Department for consumer oriented homeownership and rental housing counseling. To advise the Director, the Secretary shall appoint an advisory committee of not more than 12 individuals, equally representing mortgage and real estate industries, and including consumers and housing counseling agencies. Council members are appointed to 3-year terms. This department will coordinate media efforts to educate the general public in home ownership and home finance topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1442 added to {{USC|42|3533}}: (g) Office of Housing Consulting&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretary of [[Housing and Urban Development]] is authorized to provide grants to HUD-approved housing counseling agencies and state [[Housing Finance Agencies]] to provide education assistance to various groups in home ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1444; amending section 106(a) of the [[Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968]] ({{USC|12|1701x(a)}}) by adding: (4) Homeownership and Rental Counseling Assistance&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary is also instructed, in consultation with other federal agencies responsible for financial and banking regulation, to establish a database to track foreclosures and defaults on mortgage loans for 1 through 4 unit residential properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1447&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtitle E – Mortgage Servicing====
Subtitle E concerns jumbo rules concerning escrow and settlement procedures for people who are in trouble repaying their mortgages, and also makes amendments to the [[Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act]] of 1974. In general, in connection with a residential mortgage there should be an established [[escrow]] or impound account for the payment of taxes, [[hazard insurance]], and (if applicable) [[flood insurance]], [[mortgage insurance]], [[ground rents]], and any other required periodic payments. Lender shall disclose to borrower at least three business days before closing the specifics of the amount required to be in the escrow account and the subsequent uses of the funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1461; amending chapter 2 of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] ({{USC|15|1631}} et seq.): § 129D. Escrow or impound accounts relating to certain consumer credit transactions&lt;/ref&gt; If an escrow, impound, or trust account is not established, or the consumer chooses to close the account, the servicer shall provide a timely and clearly written disclosure to the consumer that advises the consumer of the responsibilities of the consumer and implications for the consumer in the absence of any such account.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1462; amending section 129D of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] (as added by section 1461) by adding: (j) Disclosure Notice Required For Consumers Who Waive Escrow Services&lt;/ref&gt; The amendments to the [[Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act]] of 1974 (or RESPA) change how a [[Mortgage servicer]] (those who administer loans held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.) should interact with consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1463; amending section 6 of the [[Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974]] ({{USC|12|2605}}) by adding: (k) Servicer Prohibitions&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously the Treasury Department has created the [[Home Affordable Modification Program]], set up to help eligible home owners with loan modifications on their home mortgage debt. This section requires every [[mortgage servicer]] participating in the program and denies a re-modification request to provide the borrower with any data used in a net present value (NPV) analysis. The Secretary of the Treasury is also directed to establish a Web-based site that explains NPV calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1482 modifies sections of [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to develop a [[Web-based site]] to explain the [[Home Affordable Modification Program]] and associated programs, that also provides an evaluation of the impact of the program on home loan modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1483&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard Shelby official portrait.JPG|thumb|150px|Senator [[Richard Shelby]], the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee]]

===Legislative reaction===
Senator [[Chris Dodd]], who co-proposed the legislation, has classified the legislation as "sweeping, bold, comprehensive, [and] long overdue". In regards to the Fed and what he regarded as their failure to protect consumers, Dodd voiced his opinion that "[...] I really want the Federal Reserve to get back to its core enterprises [...] We saw over the last number of years when they took on consumer protection responsibilities and the regulation of bank holding companies, it was an abysmal failure. So the idea that we're going to go back and expand those roles and functions at the expense of the vitality of the core functions that they're designed to perform is going in the wrong way." However, Dodd pointed out that the transfer of powers from the Fed to other agencies should not be construed as criticism of [[Ben Bernanke|Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke]], but rather that "[i]t's about putting together an architecture that works".&lt;ref name=hpost1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/10/dodds-proposed-financial_n_352235.html|title=Dodd's Banking Bill Takes The Fed Down A Notch Or Two: HELP US DIG THROUGH IT|first=Shahien|last=Nasiripour|author2=Ryan Grim|publisher=Huffington Post|date=November 10, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075329/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/10/dodds-proposed-financial_n_352235.html|archivedate=February 11, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to the lack of bipartisan input on the legislation, Dodd alleged that had he put together a "[...] bipartisan compromise, I think you make a huge mistake by doing that. You're given very few moments in history to make this kind of a difference, and we're trying to do that." Put another way, Dodd construed the lack of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] amendments as a sign "[...] that the bill is a strong one".&lt;ref name=hpost1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=wpost1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/09/AR2009110901935.html?hpid=topnews|title=Legislation by Senator Dodd would overhaul banking regulators|first=Binyamin|last=Appelbaum|author2=Brady Dennis|publisher=Washington Post|date=November 11, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115042834/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/09/AR2009110901935.html?hpid=topnews|archivedate=November 15, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Shelby]], the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee and the one who proposed the changes to the Fed governance, voiced his reasons for why he felt the changes needed to be made: "It's an obvious conflict of interest [...] It's basically a case where the banks are choosing or having a big voice in choosing their regulator. It's unheard of." Democratic Senator [[Jack Reed (politician)|Jack Reed]] agreed, saying "The whole governance and operation of the Federal Reserve has to be reviewed and should be reviewed. I don't think we can just assume, you know, business as usual."&lt;ref name=hpost2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/22/gop-sen-shelby-reorganize_n_330063.html|title=GOP Sen.

[[Barney Frank]], who in 2003 told auditors warning him of the risk caused by government subsidies in the mortgage market, "I want to roll the dice a little bit more in this situation toward subsidized housing" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/12/hey-barney-frank-the-government-did-cause-the-housing-crisis/249903/|title=Hey, Barney Frank: The Government Did Cause the Housing Crisis|first=Peter|last=Wallison|date=|website=theatlantic.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323062059/https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/12/hey-barney-frank-the-government-did-cause-the-housing-crisis/249903/|archivedate=23 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed his own legislative package of financial reforms in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]], did not comment on the Stability Act directly, but rather indicated that he was pleased that reform efforts were happening at all – "Obviously the bills aren't going to be identical, but it confirms that we are moving in the same direction and reaffirms my confidence that we are going to be able to get an appropriate, effective reform package passed very soon."&lt;ref name=wpost1 /&gt;

During a Senate Republican press conference on April 21, 2010, [[Richard Shelby]] reported that he and Dodd were meeting "every day", and were attempting to forge a bipartisan bill. Shelby also expressed his optimism that a "good bill" will be reached, and that "we're closer than ever". [[Saxby Chambliss]] echoed Shelby's sentiments, saying "I feel exactly as Senator Shelby does about the Banking Committee negotiations.", but voiced his concern about maintaining an active derivatives market and not driving financial firms overseas. [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] indicated her desire to see state banks have access to the Fed, while [[Orrin Hatch]] had concerns over transparency, and the lack of [[Fannie Mae|Fannie]] and [[Freddie Mac|Freddy]] reform.&lt;ref name=srep_pconf1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cspan.org/Watch/Media/2010/04/21/HP/A/32042/Senate+Republicans+Press+Conference+on+Financial+Reform+Legislation.aspx|title=Senate Republicans Press Conference on Financial Reform Legislation|first=|last=|publisher=[[C-SPAN]]|date=April 21, 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry and other groups===
Ed Yingling, president of the [[American Bankers Association]], regarded the reforms as haphazard and dangerous, saying "To some degree, it looks like they're just blowing up everything for the sake of change [...] [i]f this were to happen, the regulatory system would be in chaos for years. You have to look at the real-world impact of this."&lt;ref name=wpost1 /&gt;

The [[Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association]] (SIFMA) — the "top Wall Street lobby" — has expressed support for the law, and has urged Congress not to change or repeal it in order to prevent a stronger law from passing.&lt;ref&gt;Carney, Timothy (2011-02-13) [http://washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/2011/02/wall-street-lobbyists-gop-hands-dodd-fank Wall Street lobbyists to GOP: Hands off Dodd–Frank]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Washington Examiner]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey by [[RIMES]] of senior investment banking figures in the US and UK showed that 86% expect that Dodd–Frank will significantly increase the cost of their data operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rimes.com/rimes-survey-reveals-increased-regulation-focusing-buy-side-data-governance|title=Rimes survey reveals increased regulation focusing buy-side on data governance|publisher=[[RIMES]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204045320/http://www.rimes.com/rimes-survey-reveals-increased-regulation-focusing-buy-side-data-governance|archivedate=2014-02-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continental European scholars have also discussed the necessity of far-reaching banking reforms in light of the current crisis of confidence, recommending the adoption of [[Legally binding|binding]] [[regulation]]s that would go further than Dodd–Frank—notably in France where [[SFAF]] and [[:fr: Forum Mondial des Fonds de Pension|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] banking experts have argued that, beyond national [[legislation]]s, such rules should be adopted and implemented within the broader context of [[separation of powers]] in [[European Union law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.canadianeuropean.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Bank_Regulation_and_Financial_Orthodoxy__RAF__Jan_2010.784613.pdf |accessdate=2010-01-08 |author=M Nicolas Firzli (January 2010) |title=Bank Regulation and Financial Orthodoxy: the Lessons from the Glass-Steagall Act |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215105738/http://www.canadianeuropean.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Bank_Regulation_and_Financial_Orthodoxy__RAF__Jan_2010.784613.pdf |archivedate=2010-02-15 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Parisien "&gt;{{Cite news|author= M.

The Dodd–Frank Act has several provisions that call upon the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) to implement several new rules and regulations that will affect [[corporate governance]] issues surrounding public corporations in the United States.

Section 952 of Dodd–Frank deals with independent [[compensation committee]]s as well as their advisors and legal teams.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These provisions require the SEC to make national [[stock exchange]]s set standards for the compensation committees of publicly traded companies listed on these exchanges.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under these standards national stock exchanges are prohibited from listing public companies that do not have an independent compensation committee.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; To insure that compensation committees remain independent, the SEC is required to identify any areas that may create a potential conflict of interest and work to define exactly what requirements must be met for the committee to be considered independent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some of the areas examined for conflicts of interest include other services provided by advisors, personal relationships between advisors and shareholders, advisor fees as a percentage of their company's revenue, and advisors' stock holdings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These provisions also cover advisors and legal teams serving compensation committees by requiring proxy statements to disclose any compensation consultants and include a review of each to ensure no conflicts of interest exist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Compensation committees are fully responsible for selecting advisors and determining their compensation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Final regulations covering issues surrounding compensation committees were implemented in June 2012 by the SEC and took effect in July 2012.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under these regulations the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and [[NASDAQ]] also added their own rules regarding the retention of committee advisors.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These regulations were approved by the SEC in 2013 and took full effect in early 2014.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Section 953 of Dodd–Frank deals with [[pay for performance (human resources)|pay for performance]] policies to determine executive compensation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Provisions from this section require the SEC to make regulations regarding the disclosure of executive compensation as well as regulations on how executive compensation is determined.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; New regulations require that compensation paid to executives be directly linked to financial performance including consideration of any changes in the value of the company's stock price or value of dividends paid out.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The compensation of executives and the financial performance justifying it are both required to be disclosed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, regulations require that CEO compensation be disclosed alongside the median employee compensation excluding CEO compensation, along with ratios comparing levels of compensation between the two.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Regulations regarding pay for performance were proposed by the SEC in September 2013 and were adopted in August 2015.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/08/14/sec-adopts-ceo-pay-ratio-disclosure-rule/|title=SEC Adopts CEO pay Ratio Disclosure Rule|last=Gregory|first=Holly|date=14 August 2015|website=Harvard Law School Forum|publisher=Harvard Law School|access-date=3 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110112340/https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/08/14/sec-adopts-ceo-pay-ratio-disclosure-rule/|archivedate=10 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 954 of Dodd–Frank deals with clawback of compensation policies, which work to ensure that executives do not profit from inaccurate financial reporting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These provisions require the SEC to create regulations that must be adopted by national stock exchanges, which in turn require publicly traded companies who wish to be listed on the exchange to have clawback policies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These policies require executives to return inappropriately awarded compensation, as set forth in section 953 regarding pay for performance, in the case of an accounting restatement due to noncompliance with reporting requirements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If an accounting restatement is made then the company must recover any compensation paid to current or former executives associated with the company the three years prior to the restatement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The SEC proposed regulations dealing with clawback of compensation in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/10/28/the-sec-proposed-clawback-rule/|title=The SEC Proposed Clawback Rule|last=Bachelder|first=Joseph|date=28 October 2015|website=Harvard Law School Forum|publisher=Harvard Law School|access-date=3 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110110648/https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/10/28/the-sec-proposed-clawback-rule/|archivedate=10 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 955 of Dodd–Frank deals with employees' and directors' hedging practices.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These provisions stipulate that the SEC must implement rules requiring public companies to disclose in proxy statements whether or not employees and directors of the company are permitted to hold a [[Short (finance)|short position]] on any equity shares of the company.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This applies to both employees and directors who are compensated with company stock as well as those who are simply owners of company stock.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The SEC proposed rules regarding hedging in February 2015.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/02/16/aligning-the-interests-of-company-executives-and-directors-with-shareholders/|title=Aligning the Interest of Company Executives and Directors with Shareholders|last=Aguilar|first=Luis|date=16 February 2015|website=Harvard Law School Forum|publisher=Harvard Law School|access-date=3 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110110529/https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/02/16/aligning-the-interests-of-company-executives-and-directors-with-shareholders/|archivedate=10 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 957 deals with broker voting and relates to section 951 dealing with executive compensation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While section 951 requires say on pay and golden parachute votes from shareholders, section 957 requires national exchanges to prohibit brokers from voting on executive compensation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, the provisions in this section prevent brokers from voting on any major corporate governance issue as determined by the SEC including the election of board members.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This gives shareholders more influence on important issues since brokers tend to vote shares in favor of executives.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Brokers may only vote shares if they are directly instructed to do so by shareholders associated with the shares.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The SEC approved the listing rules set forth by the NYSE and NASDAQ regarding provisions from section 957 in September 2010.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Additional provisions set forth by Dodd–Frank in section 972 require public companies to disclose in proxy statements reasons for why the current CEO and chairman of the board hold their positions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The same rule applies to new appointments for CEO or [[chairman of the board]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Public companies must find reasons supporting their decisions to retain an existing chairman of the board or CEO or reasons for selecting new ones to keep shareholders informed.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Provisions from Dodd–Frank found in section 922 also address [[Whistleblower|whistle blower]] protection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under new regulations any whistle blowers who voluntarily expose inappropriate behavior in public corporations can be rewarded with substantial compensation and will have their jobs protected.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Regulations entitle whistle blowers to between ten and thirty percent of any monetary sanctions put on the corporation above one million dollars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These provisions also enact anti-retaliation rules that entitle whistle blowers the right to have a jury trial if they feel they have been wrongfully terminated as a result of whistle blowing.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If the jury finds that whistle blowers have been wrongfully terminated, then they must be reinstated to their positions and receive compensation for any back-pay and legal fees.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This rule also applies to any private subsidiaries of public corporations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The SEC put these regulations in place in May 2011.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Section 971 of Dodd–Frank deals with proxy access and shareholders' ability to nominate candidates for director positions in public companies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Provisions in the section allow shareholders to use proxy materials to contact and form groups with other shareholders in order to nominate new potential directors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the past, activist investors had to pay to have materials prepared and mailed to other investors in order to solicit their help on issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Any shareholder group that has held at least three percent of voting shares for a period of at least three years is entitled to make director nominations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, shareholder groups may not nominate more than twenty five percent of a company's board and may always nominate at least one member even if that one nomination would represent over twenty five percent of the board.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If multiple shareholder groups make nominations then the nominations from groups with the most voting power will be considered first with additional nominations being considered up to the twenty five percent cap.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Impact ==
===Congressional Budget Office===
On April 21, 2010, the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] released a cost-estimate of enacting the legislation. In its introduction, the CBO briefly discussed the legislation and then went on to generally state that it is unable to assess the cost of financial crises under current law, and added that estimating the cost of similar crises under this legislation (or other proposed ideas) is equally (and inherently) difficult: "[...] CBO has not determined whether the estimated costs under the Act would be smaller or larger than the costs of alternative approaches to addressing future financial crises and the risks they pose to the economy as a whole."&lt;ref name="cbo_costestimate1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/114xx/doc11454/s3217.pdf|title=Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate|last=|first=|date=April 21, 2010|publisher=[[Congressional Budget Office]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213341/http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/114xx/doc11454/s3217.pdf|archivedate=April 29, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the impact on the federal budget, the CBO estimates that deficits would reduce between 2011–2020, but in part due to the risk-based assessment fees levied to initially capitalize the Orderly Liquidation Fund; after which, the majority of revenue for the fund would be drawn primarily from interest payments. Due to this, the CBO projects that eventually the money being paid into the Fund (in the form of fees) would be exceeded by the expenses of the Fund itself. Additionally, the CBO points out that the reclassification of collected fees by various government agencies has the effect of boosting revenue.&lt;ref name=cbo_costestimate1 /&gt;

The cost estimate also raises questions about the time-frame of capitalizing the Fund – their estimate took the projected value of fees collected for the Fund (and interest collected on the Fund) weighed against the expected expense of having to deal with corporate default(s) until 2020. Their conclusion was it would take longer than 10 years to fully capitalize the Fund (at which point they estimated it would be approximately 45 billion), although no specifics beyond that were expressed.&lt;ref name=cbo_costestimate1 /&gt;

The projection was a $5 billion or more deficit increase in at least one of the ten-year periods starting in 2021.&lt;ref name=cbo_costestimate1 /&gt;

===Effects on small banks===
Associated Press reported that in response to the costs that the legislation places on banks, some banks have ended the practice of giving their customers free checking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/10/say_goodbye_to_traditional_fre.html Say goodbye to traditional free checking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029163755/http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/10/say_goodbye_to_traditional_fre.html |date=2010-10-29 }}, Associated Press, October 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Small banks have been forced to end some businesses such as mortgages and car loans in response to the new regulations.

Community banks' share of the US banking assets and lending market fell from over 40% in 1994 to around 20% today, although this is a misleading at best but highly likely inaccurate number considering the Dodd-Frank was implemented 16 years later than 1994. These experts believe that regulatory barriers fall most heavily on small banks, even though legislators intended to target large financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/awp37|title="The State and Fate of Community Banking"|last1=Lux|first1=Marshall|date=2015|publisher=Harvard Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government|last2=Robert|first2=Greene|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120070545/https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/awp37|archivedate=2017-01-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complying with the statute seems to have resulted in job shifting or job creation in the business of fulfilling reporting requirements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/27/us-financial-regulation-jobs-idUSTRE79Q7PC20111027|title=Analysis: Dodd–Frank, the jobs bill no one talks about|last=Alper|first=Alexandra|date=October 27, 2011|accessdate=2012-03-15|publisher=Reuters|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231173539/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/27/us-financial-regulation-jobs-idUSTRE79Q7PC20111027|archivedate=December 31, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while making it more difficult to fire employees who report criminal violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewer.aspx?fid=d206d4f7-670d-49bc-a9c1-61958b636160|title=Dodd–Frank: Final Whistleblower Provisions Take Effect August 12th Is Your Company Ready? &amp;#124; Dinsmore &amp; Shohl LLP|author=Dinsmore &amp; Shohl LLP on 7/29/2011|date=2011-07-29|publisher=JDSupra|accessdate=2012-03-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911125858/http://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewer.aspx?fid=d206d4f7-670d-49bc-a9c1-61958b636160|archivedate=2011-09-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the Dodd–Frank Law believe that it will affect job creation, in a sense that because of stricter regulation unemployment will increase significantly. However, the Office of Management and Budget attempts to "monetize" benefits versus costs to prove the contrary. The result is a positive relationship where benefits exceed costs: "During a 10-year period OMB reviewed 106 major regulations for which cost and benefit data were available [...] $136 billion to $651 billion in annual benefits versus $44 billion to $62 billion in annual costs" (Shapiro and Irons, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;8).&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, I., &amp; Irons, J. (2011). Regulation, employment, and the economy: Fears of job loss are overblown. Economic Policy Institute. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/911202396&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scholarly views ===
According to Federal Reserve Chairwoman [[Janet Yellen]] in August 2017, "The balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://econofact.org/the-dodd-frank-financial-reform|title=The Dodd–Frank Financial Reform {{!}} Econofact|date=2017-09-08|work=Econofact|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911063227/http://econofact.org/the-dodd-frank-financial-reform|archivedate=2017-09-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts have argued that Dodd–Frank does not protect consumers adequately and does not end [[too big to fail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Morgenson|first=Gretchen|title=Strong Enough for Tough Stains?|date=June 25, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/business/27gret.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2010-06-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628152333/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/business/27gret.html|archivedate=June 28, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law professor and bankruptcy expert David Skeel concluded that the law has two major themes: "government partnership with the largest Wall Street banks and financial institutions" and "a system of ad hoc interventions by regulators that are divorced from basic rule-of-law constraints". While he states that "the overall pattern of the legislation is disturbing", he also concludes that some are clearly helpful, such as the derivatives exchanges and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;Skeel, David 2010. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1690979 The New Financial Deal: Understanding the Dodd–Frank Act and Its (Unintended) Consequences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326045718/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1690979 |date=2015-03-26 }}. Hoboken NJ: [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the Republican-led rollback of some provisions of Dodd-Frank in 2018, this move from increased regulation after a crisis to deregulation during an economic boom has been a recurrent feature in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulatory Cycles: Revisiting the Political Economy of Financial Crises|publisher=SSRN|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2772373|date=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whistleblower-driven settlements===
The SEC's 2017 annual report on the Dodd-Frank whistleblower program stated: "Since the program’s inception, the SEC has ordered wrongdoers in enforcement matters involving whistleblower information to pay over $975 million in total monetary sanctions, including more than $671 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and interest, the majority of which has been...returned to harmed investors."  Whistleblowers receive 10-30% of this amount under the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/files/sec-2017-annual-report-whistleblower-program.pdf|title=SEC-2017 Annual Report to Congress-Whistleblower Program-November 15, 2017|author=|date=|website=sec.gov|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414183332/https://www.sec.gov/files/sec-2017-annual-report-whistleblower-program.pdf|archivedate=14 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer Financial Protection Bureau activities===
The Act established the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB), which has the mission of protecting consumers in the financial markets. Then-CFPB Director Richard Cordray testified on April 5, 2017 that: "Over the past five years, we have returned almost $12 billion to 29 million consumers and imposed about $600 million in civil penalties."&lt;ref name="consumerfinance.gov"/&gt; The CFPB publishes a semi-annual report on its activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/semi-annual-report-spring-2017/|title=Semi-Annual Report Spring 2017 - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|author=|date=|website=Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505004424/https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/semi-annual-report-spring-2017/|archivedate=5 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial repeal==

On March 14, 2018, the US Senate passed the [[Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act]] exempting dozens of US banks from the Dodd-Frank Act's banking regulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://thehill.com/policy/finance/378491-senate-passes-bipartisan-bill-to-rollback-dodd-frank&lt;/ref&gt; On May 22, 2018, the law passed in the US House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/congress-just-approved-bill-dismantle-parts-dodd-frank-banking-rule-n876516&lt;/ref&gt; On May 24, 2018, President Trump signed the partial repeal into law.&lt;ref&gt;http://thehill.com/policy/finance/389212-trump-signs-dodd-frank-rollback&lt;/ref&gt;

== Textual history ==
Many translations, editions and reprints of Wheaton's ''Elements'' have appeared since its first publication. The third edition was published in Philadelphia in 1845. At the request of Wheaton's family, the sixth edition, with the last corrections of the author and a biographical notice, was published by [[William Beach Lawrence]] (Boston, 1855).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wheaton |first=Henry |title =Elements of International Law; with last corrections of the author, additional notes, and introductory remarks, containing a notice of Mr. Wheaton's diplomatic career, and the antecedents of his life  by William Beach Lawrence |publisher=Little, Brown and Company|place=Boston |year =1855 |edition = 6 |accessdate= April 20, 2018 |url=https://archive.org/stream/elementsofintern00whea#page/n5/mode/2up |via = Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence also published the seventh edition (1863). The eight edition was published, with new notes and a new biography, by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] (Boston, 1866).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wheaton |first=Henry |title =Elements of International Law; edited, with notes, by Richard Henry Dana |publisher=Little, Brown and Company|place=Boston |year =1866 |edition = 8 |accessdate= November 27, 2017|url=https://archive.org/details/elementsinterna00wheagoog|via = Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dana's alleged use of Lawrence's notes from the previous editions resulted in a protracted legal controversy.&lt;ref name=appletons/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Wheaton, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A French translation was published in [[Leipzig]] and [[Paris]] in 1848. At the instance of [[Anson Burlingame]], U.S. minister to China, Wheaton's book was translated into Chinese and published at the expense of the imperial government (4 vols., Pekin, 1865).&lt;ref name=appletons&gt;{{Appletons'|wstitle=Wheaton, Henry|year=1889|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The translator was American [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionary [[William Alexander Parsons Martin]] who was working in China at that time.&lt;ref name="BDCC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdcconline.net/en/stories/m/martin-william-alexander-parsons.php|title=William Alexander Parsons Martin
|publisher=[[Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Christianity]]|accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was also translated into Japanese&lt;ref name=appletons/&gt; and the language of each country of [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="Bartleby"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/226/0612.html|title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature|accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original edition bore the title ''Elements of International Law with a Sketch of the History of the Subject''. Some subsequent editions omitted the "Sketch," which in 1845 became (in expanded form) part of Wheaton's ''History of the Law of Nations in Europe and America''.&lt;ref&gt;

|quote= Wheaton's historical 'Sketch' disappeared in later editions of the ''Elements'' but re-emerged in a more comprehensive form in 1845 when Wheaton published his '''History of the Law of Nations in Europe and America; from the Earliest Times to the Treaty of Washington, 1842'' (1845) [...]

== Influence ==

The translations had a large influence on the approval of modern international law in Asia.&lt;ref name="Bartleby"/&gt;  Wheaton's was the first book to introduce international law to [[East Asia]] in full scale.&lt;ref name="Koreaherald"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/opinion/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20100907000976|title=Treaty as prelude to annexation

In listing Henry Wheaton among "prominent jurists of the nineteenth century," [[Antony Anghie]] comments on the "several editions" of ''Elements of International Law'' and on the work as "widely respected and used at this time."&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10595">'''Emma Augusta Hempstead Cunningham''' (1818&amp;ndash;1887) was a young woman from [[New York City, New York|New York City]] who was embroiled in a scandalous relationship that ended in a crime of murder. She was arrested for murder and fraud, and was sent to trial in one of the most famous cases in the [[Victorian-era]].

==Scandal==
Emma Cunningham was a young woman in New York City when she married a widower, George Cunningham in 1835. When he died in 1852 his life insurance policy amounted to $10,000, a tidy sum. As an attractive widow, she met Dr. Harvey Burdell, a prosperous [[dentist]] and rented a suite of rooms in his mansion as did other tenants, such as John J. Eckel (later to be accused as an [[Accessory_(legal_term)|accessory]]). It was intimated that Cunningham was sexually involved with both of these men.

Dr. Burdell resided and practiced dentistry at his townhouse on 31 [[Bond Street (Manhattan)|Bond Street]] in New York City, one of the most affluent blocks in pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] New York. This area declined rapidly in the mid-century and only a few traces of the thirty-five Greek Revival homes remain. Burdell, like his neighbors, was very wealthy, although his reputation was far from sterling as he was accused of [[embezzlement]], reneging on debts and causing a [[scandal]] on his wedding day by demanding money from the bride's father who was enraged and canceled the wedding.&lt;ref name="trials"&gt;{{cite book

==Murder==
On the morning of January 31, 1857, Dr. Burdell's servants discovered his body in his office, at 31 Bond Street, covered with blood, brutally stabbed multiple times and strangled.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news

The police determined that Dr. Burdell had been stabbed at least 15 times by an assailant who was left-handed. Since Emma Cunningham was left-handed, she was an immediate suspect and was arrested for Burdell's murder and imprisoned for trial.&lt;ref name="celebrated"&gt;{{cite book

==Trial==
The trial, at its time, was as notorious as the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson trial]] was in the 1990s and was accompanied by a [[media circus]] akin to such trials today.&lt;ref name="brooklyn"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reputed 8,000 people tried to cram into the church for the funeral and Cunningham reportedly threw herself dramatically on Burdell's casket.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

During the first evening of the Coroner's investigation, on January 31, 1857, Mrs. Cunningham produced a certificate of marriage revealing that she and Dr. Burdell had been married on October 28, 1856. This gave the prosecutor a suspected motive for murder, for as wife, she would inherit his fortune. Dr. Burdell's estate was estimated at $100,000, which included the townhouse where he was murdered, and various other real estate. All the members of the household, including servants and Emma Cunningham and her family were placed under house arrest by Coroner Edward Connery, as was custom at the time. After a fourteen-day coroner's investigation, which took place in the parlor of 31 Bond Street, the case was delivered to a grand jury, where Emma Cunningham was indicted for the murder of Dr. Burdell. She was placed in jail awaiting her trial. The top defense attorney, Henry Lauren Clinton, represented Emma Cunningham. The New York City District Attorney, Abraham Oakey Hall was the prosecutor. Hall later became Mayor of New York City in 1869.&lt;ref name="trials" /&gt;

At the murder trial, which began in May 1857, there was much testimony from all sides. Cunningham did not testify. One of Burdell's maids testified that she had called him a bad man who was not fit to live. A man named John Eckels, a boarder at the home of Dr. Burdell, was labeled an accessory to the murder, but testimony to his actions was not heard during Cunningham's trial. Also, all testimony to the marriage certificate was not heard, as its validity was being tested in the Surrogate's Court. Burdell's widely known unsavory reputation made accusation against Cunningham difficult for the prosecutor to make credible. On May 9, 1857, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty and Cunningham was free to go.&lt;ref name="celebrated"/&gt;

==Baby scandal==
After Emma Cunningham's acquittal, she was permitted to return to the townhouse on 31 Bond Street, pending a hearing and decision of the Surrogate's Court to determine if in fact her marriage to Dr. Harvey Burdell was valid, and if that entitled her to his house and other property. At the time, marriage was conducted by a clergyman, and witnessed, but was not registered with any office of the state to make it legal and valid. The marriage certificate in question was signed by a clergyman, both parties and two witnesses. The clergyman recalled the event. The only way to invalidate the marriage was to prove that it was an imposter and not Dr. Burdell himself who appeared to be married. The Surrogate's decision on the matter of the marriage and the inheritance was scheduled for August 1857.

Prior to that decision, a scandal erupted involving Emma Cunningham. It was purported by [[District Attorney]] Oakey Hall that Cunningham had "procured" a baby by paying $1000 to declare a false heir, with the father as Dr. Burdell. This would entitle her to all of Dr. Burdell's fortune, instead of just her widow's share. The prosecutor and chief of police raided her home and removed Cunningham, who was delirious and under the influence of drugs. Also present was a doctor and a baby that had been marked under the arms with acid, as it had been prepared by the district attorney prior to the sting. The "baby scam" had been engineered by the district attorney, and the doctor who testified to the events was his close associate, Dr. de la Montagnie, who was also the godfather of Hall's daughter. Emma Cunningham was briefly taken to the Tombs, the New York City jail, where she had already spent two months while awaiting the murder trial. 

Her defense attorney, Henry Clinton, had the charges swiftly dismissed based on lack of evidence of a crime, and due to entrapment. Cunningham was again released. To this day it is unclear if the 'baby scam' was fabricated and engineered by the district attorney or if Emma Cunningham was delusional and engaged in the act of attempting to buy an heir. It would be an unlikely move for her to attempt when she was already in line to split a significant fortune with Burdell's relatives. All of the testimony and reportage of her claimed pregnancy was after-the-fact hearsay and never verified as fact. However, the judge in the Surrogate's case was negatively influenced by the incident, and ruled that Emma Cunningham, although acquitted of any wrongdoing, would not inherit any money or property from Burdell's estate.

From August 1857 onward, Emma Cunningham was a free woman; however her reputation was forever tainted, as she would always be suspected of being involved in the infamous murder. By the end of that year, she was penniless and eventually moved to the West Coast. She returned to New York City in 1887, where she died at the home of a cousin; she was 69. Her death was reported in the ''New York Times'' on September 18, 1887. 

During the following century, many of the accounts of the murder repeated the disproved or uncorroborated hearsay that had, at the time of the trial, been eliminated from the court proceedings as hearsay or corrected in the press. Over time, there were several unverified confessions to the murder. The murder was never solved.

==Significance==
In contrast to the trial of [[Judith Catchpole]] in 1636 in which an all-female jury was empaneled to inspect her body and determine if she had been pregnant and given birth, Victorian morality prevented such a direct approach. Without proper medical evidence of her condition, there was not a way to prove during the trial that she was not pregnant.

==Gravesite==
Emma's story was featured a season 1 episode of ''[[Monumental Mysteries]]''. According to the series, Cunningham is buried at [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Her gray-granite tombstone reads, Emma Augusta Hempstead Cunningham 1818-1887 – "May God Rest Her Troubled Soul" and depicts a beautiful tree etched into the stone. And in a twist of fate, Burdell's grave is only a hundred yards away from hers. Burdell’s gray-granite tombstone is etched with a [[Salix babylonica#Horticultural selections and related hybrids|weeping willow]] reads, Harvey Burdell 1811-1857 – "We humbly beseech thee, O father, to raise us from the life of righteousness; that when we shall depart this life we may rest in him."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.murderbygaslight.com/2011/03/bond-street-tragedy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fundamental Statute of the Kingdom of Albania''' was the [[constitution]] used in the [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–43)|Albanian Kingdom]]. It was introduced by King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] after the [[Italian invasion of Albania]]. It replaced the [[Fundamental Statute of the Kingdom of Albania (1928)|previous constitution of the same name]]. It was signed by Victor Emmanuel III on 3 June 1939 and then presented to [[Shefqet Vërlaci]] in Rome, and went into effect the following day.&lt;ref name="BFSP"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= Fundamental Statute of the Kingdom of Albania-June 4, 1939 |access-date= |edition= |date=1951 |year= |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |series=British and Foreign State Papers |volume=Vol. 143 1939 |location=London |pages= 327-332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1939 constitution proclaimed Victor Emmanuel III the King of Albania and made Albania a [[constitutional monarchy]]. It also created a "Supreme Fascist Corporation Council" to serve as the legislature of Albania, structured after Italy's [[Chamber of Fasci and Corporations]].&lt;ref name="Peaslee 65"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peaslee |first=Amos J. |year=1956 |title=Constitutions of Nations |url= |location=The Hague, Netherlands |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |volume=I |edition=2nd |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1939 constitution was replaced on 15 March 1946, after [[Enver Hoxha]] promulgated a constitution for the newly formed [[People's Republic of Albania]].&lt;ref name="Peaslee 65"/&gt;

A '''green home''' is a type of [[house]] designed to be [[Sustainability|environmentally sustainable]]. Green homes focus on the efficient use of "[[Low-energy house|energy]], [[Water conservation|water]], and [[Sustainable architecture|building materials]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Good green homes |last=Roberts |first=Jennifer |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=Gibbs Smith |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6puyqEok3YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Green+home%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EWrxTOCXHYKB8gbzr5H3Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Green%20home%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A green home may utilize sustainably sourced, environmentally friendly, and/or recycled building materials. It may include sustainable energy sources such as solar or geothermal, and be sited to take maximum advantage of natural features such as sunlight and tree cover to improve energy efficiency.

==Elements==
No government standards define what constitutes a green remodel, beyond non-profit certification. In general, a green home is a house that is built or remodeled in order to conserve "energy or water; improve indoor air quality; use sustainable, recycled or used materials; and produce less waste in the process." This may include buying more [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] [[Home appliance|appliances]] or employing building materials that are more efficient in managing temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Green home remodeling still a gray area |author=Jennifer Alsever |newspaper=[[MSNBC]] |date=June 5, 2007

==History==

=== United States ===
In the United States, the [[green building]] movement began in the 1970s, after the price of oil began to increase sharply. In response, researchers began to look into more energy efficient systems. Many organizations were founded in the 1990s to promote green buildings. Some organizations worked to improve consumer knowledge so that they could have more green homes. The International Code Council and the [[National Association of Home Builders]] began working in 2006 to create a "voluntary green home building standard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Green Building and Remodeling |last=Queen |first=Bill |authorlink= |author2=Lori Hall Steele |author3=John Barrows |author4=Lisa Iannucci  |year=2009 |publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YB4ADAMeqIAC&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=%22Green+home%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v3LxTMSHPIyr8Aa57ei6Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Green%20home%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005|Energy Policy Act]] was enacted in 2005, which allowed tax reductions for homeowners who could show the use of energy efficient changes to their homes, such as [[solar panel]]s and other solar-powered devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Groundbreaking Green Home Tax Breaks |author=Matt Woolsey |newspaper=[[Forbes]] |date=March 7, 2007 |url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/03/06/tax-green-credit-forbeslife-cx_mw_0307greencredits.html |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certifications==
Various types of certifications certify a home as a green home. The [[U.S. Green Building Council]] is an example of an organization that gives out green home certifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Some buyers will pay more for 'green' home |author=Janet Frankston |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=April 10, 2004 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/614276091.html?dids=614276091:614276091&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+10%2C+2004&amp;author=Janet+Frankston%2C+Atlanta+Journal&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Some+buyers+will+pay+more+for+'green'+home&amp;pqatl=google |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its certification is titled as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]].

The Indian Green Building Council (IGBC), part of the [[Confederation of Indian Industry]] was formed in the year 2001. The council offers a wide array of services that include developing new green building rating programmes, certification services and green building training programmes.

'''''I.G. and Others vs. Slovakia''''' is the third case decided by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] against [[Slovakia]] concerning [[forced sterilization]] of [[Romani people]] or Gypsy women. Although the case was the third decision on the practice, it was actually the first case brought to the European Court by the Slovak feminist organization Center for Civil and Human Rights already in 2004.

The case concerned three Romani women - I.G., R.K. and M.K., who were forcibly sterilized in [[Krompachy]] Hospital in Eastern Slovakia. Applicants I.G. and M.K were underage minors at the time of the interventions. I.G. was sterilized in 2000, during the delivery of her second child. She was not informed about the intervention at the time and found out about it only three years later, after she examined her medical records in the Hospital. M.K. was sterilized in 1999, also during the delivery of her second child. She and her parents found about the intervention only after it was already performed on her. The applicant R.H. was sterilized in 2002 without her informed consent

Since 2003, all applicants were trying to obtain damages at the Slovak courts, including the Constitutional Court. They also acted as injured parties in the criminal proceedings, led by the Slovak police and prosecutors from 2003 onwards. Only M.K. received compensations from the District Court in [[Spišská Nová Ves]] in amount of EUR 1,593. The European Court, however, did not find this compensation adequate in the light of the seriousness of the violations.

The case was lodged to the European Court already in 2004, claiming violations of several provisions of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. In its decision from 13 November 2012, the European Court ruled in favor of I.G. and M.K. Since, R.K., died during the course of the proceedings, the European Court did not consider her complaint.

The European Court declared that the sterilization without informed consent of their legal guardians violated the Slovak legislation valid at the time of the interventions. As such, it violated their right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment, guaranteed by
Article 3 of the Convention. Yet again, the European Court found that Slovakia also violated the positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention to provide effective protection of reproductive right of Romani women, who are particularly vulnerable group in the population.

Importantly, the decision differs from the previous cases on the matter in the fact that for the first time, the Court also found that the investigation led by the Slovak authorities into the case did not meet the standards of effective investigation guaranteed by the Convention (procedural aspect of Article 3).

Apart of the violation of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention, the Court ordered the Slovak Government to pay the compensations to the applicants in amount of 28,500 EUR and 27,000 EUR respectively and the reimbursement of their legal costs

'''John Keane''' is Professor of Politics at the [[University of Sydney]] and at the [[Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=(WZB) |url= http://www.wzb.eu/en/research/civil-society-conflicts-and-democracy/democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 he founded the [[Centre for the Study of Democracy]] (CSD) in London. He is the Director of the recently founded [http://www.sydneydemocracynetwork.org Sydney Democracy Network].

Keane was born in southern Australia and educated at the Universities of Adelaide, Toronto and Cambridge.

==Career==
In recent years, he has held the Karl Deutsch Professorship in Berlin, co-directed a European Commission-funded project on the future of civil society and citizenship, and served as a Fellow of the London-based think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). He recently held a Major Research Fellowship awarded by the Leverhulme Trust and is a Fellow of the Fudan Institute for Advanced Study in Social Sciences in Shanghai.

During his many years of residence in Britain, The Times of London ranked him as "one of Australia’s great intellectual exports and among the world’s leading political thinkers and writers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2993312.htm | title=John Keane | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His current research interests include China, the Asia and Pacific region and the future of global institutions; the twenty-first century enemies of democracy; fear and violence; religion and the history of secularism; philosophies of language and history; the origins and future of representative government; the history and politics of Islam;and (the subject of a forthcoming book) Power, Freedom of communication and media decadence in the digital age.
In 2013, John Keane's decision to withdraw the invitation to host the lecture of the 14th Dalai Lama raised controversies and public protests. Following the protests that took place at the University of Sydney, IHDR reversed its decision on the invitation.

==Monitory Democracy==
The term ''[[monitory democracy]]'' is introduced in Keane's ''[[The Life and Death of Democracy]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009, p.xxvii and part 3 of the book&lt;/ref&gt; It claims that from around 1945 democracy entered a new historical phase.&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009, p. 688&lt;/ref&gt; In the age of 'monitory democracy', the language and ideals and institutions of democracy undergo many changes. For the first time in its history, democracy has grown familiar to people living within most regions of the earth, regardless of their language, nationality, religion or civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009, p. 676&lt;/ref&gt; This process of 'indigenisation' helps explain why, again for the first time, there is an explosion of many different understandings of democracy (for many people, especially in poorer countries, it becomes synonymous with justice, electricity, sanitation and other [[public good]]s); and why there are references to 'global democracy' and much talk of democracy as a universal ideal.&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009, p. 852&lt;/ref&gt; Democracy becomes globally accepted as the political governing form par excellence. For the first time as well, [[Racism|racial prejudice]] is said to be incompatible with the ideals of democracy. In contrast to the age of [[representative democracy]], which ended just prior to [[World War Two]], many democrats consequently feel embarrassed or angered by talk of 'naturally inferior', or 'backward' or 'uncivilised' peoples.&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009, p. xxiii and p. 676&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synopsis===
In the age of monitory democracy, less obviously, there are indications that the theory and practice of democracy are mutating, that its significance is changing because its institutions are being stretched into areas of life in which democracy in any form was previously excluded, or played only a limited role.&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009, pp. 709 – 710&lt;/ref&gt; Once seen as the rule of the people, by the people and for the people, democracy is viewed more pragmatically, as a vital weapon for guaranteeing political equality against concentrations of publicly unaccountable power. That is what monitory democracy means: the ongoing public scrutiny and public control of decision makers, whether they operate in the field of government or [[Intergovernmentalism|inter-governmental]] institutions, or within so-called non-governmental or [[civil society]] organisations, such as businesses, trade unions, [[Sports club|sports associations]] and charities.&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009, pp. 688–9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the age of monitory democracy, in contrast to the earlier eras of assembly democracy and representative democracy in territorial state form, many new mechanisms are mixed and combined with new ways of publicly monitoring and controlling the exercise of power. Representative [[Form of government|forms of government]] do not simply wither, or disappear.&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009, p. 690&lt;/ref&gt; Elections remain important and representative democracy within the framework of territorial states often survives, and in some countries it even thrives, sometimes (as in Mongolia, Taiwan and South Africa) for the first time ever.&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009, p. xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to renew representative government are commonplace, as in the civic involvement and clean-up schemes (''machizukuri'') in Japanese cities such as Yokohama and Kawasaki during the past several decades. But, for a variety of reasons that are related to [[Public Pressure]] and the need to reduce corruption and the abuse of power, conventional representative forms of democracy are coming to be supplemented (and hence complicated) by a variety of democratic innovations that are applied to organisations underneath and beyond governments.&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009, p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; Others include public integrity mechanisms, congresses, blogging and other new forms of media scrutiny,&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009, p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; as well as cross-border parliaments and open methods of co-ordination,&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009, pp. 689- 690&lt;/ref&gt; of the kind practised in [[European Union|the European Union]]. These inventions are unique to the age of monitory democracy, and they fundamentally alter both the political geometry and dynamics of democracy. Democracy becomes nothing less but much more than electoral democracy. According to Keane, although its future is by no means guaranteed, monitory democracy is the most intricate, complex and dynamic form of democracy, a type of post-electoral democracy that has long-term consequences and disorientating effects upon political parties, parliaments, politicians and governments. He concludes that in the age of public monitoring of power, democracy can no longer be seen as a [[done deal]], or as already achieved.&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009, p. xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt; Monitory democracy is an unfinished experiment that both thrives on imperfection and requires fresh ways of thinking about democracy's virtues and its imperfections and failures.&lt;ref&gt;John Keane, ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009, p. 866&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau''', or '''Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration''', was a [[treaty]] between [[Portugal]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] over the status of [[Macau]]. The full name of the treaty is '''Joint Declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Portuguese Republic on the question of Macao'''. Signed on 26 March, 1987 the Declaration established the process and conditions of the transfer of the territory from Portuguese rule to the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=Government Printing Bureau (Macao SAR) 
|year=1987
|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joint Declaration served also as the main source of fundamental rights that were implemented in the Macau Special Administrative Region Basic Law.  The process was similar to the transfer of [[Hong Kong]] to Chinese sovereignty by the [[United Kingdom]] in 1997.

==Background==
By the 17th century, Portugal had established colonial rule over Macau after gaining concessions from various Chinese governments. In 1887, Portugal and the [[Qing dynasty]] signed the '''Sino-Portuguese Draft Minutes''' and the '''[[Sino–Portuguese Treaty of Peking]]''', in which China ceded to Portugal the right to "perpetual occupation and government of Macau"; conversely, Portugal pledged to seek China's approval before transferring Macau to another country. Colonial rule continued until 1974, when the [[Carnation revolution]] installed a democratic regime in Portugal that sought to end colonialism. Bilateral talks between China and Portugal led to the status of Macau being established as Chinese territory under Portuguese administration. The full framework of transfer of sovereignty was decided in 1987 with the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration.&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt;

==Provisions==
The ''Declaração'' provided for Portuguese administration to officially end on 20 December, 1999. Although it would become a full part of the People's Republic of China, Macau would enjoy the status of a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]] (SAR), with full autonomy and self-governance in domestic affairs, economic policy and internal security.&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P4"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/ljzg/3566/t17778.htm

|title=What are the main contents of the Sino–Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao?
|date=2000-11-15
|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system of "[[One country, two systems]]" would be established, exempting Macau from the [[Socialist]] system and several laws decreed by the central government in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name="P4"/&gt; The [[capitalism|capitalist]], legal system and liberal society enjoyed by Macau would remain unchanged for a minimum of 50 years after the transfer. The Chinese government would not levy taxes on Macau nor make laws pertaining to Macau's governance. The Macau SAR would enjoy a great degree of autonomy in all but foreign affairs and defence, which would remain under Chinese control.&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; Bearing the name of "Macau, China," Macau would enjoy the right to conclude agreements and arrangements with Portugal and international organisations for its own development. The Chinese [[National People's Congress]] would enact a "Basic Law" that would formalise the respecting of some basic principles of Chinese government in Macau, but leaving other areas untouched.&lt;ref name="P4"/&gt;

'''Judgment summons''', in [[English law]], a summons issued under the [[Debtors' Act of 1869|Debtors' Act 1869]],&lt;ref&gt;Regnal 32 &amp; 33 Vic., c. 62&lt;/ref&gt; on the application of a creditor who has obtained a judgment for the payment of a sum of money by instalments or otherwise, where the order for payment has not been complied with. The [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] summons cites the defendant to appear personally in court, and be examined on oath as to the means he has, or has had, since the date of the order or judgment made against him, to pay the same, and to show cause why he should not be committed to prison for his default. An order of commitment obtained in a judgment summons remains in force for a year only, and the extreme term of imprisonment is six weeks, dating from the time of lodging in prison.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Judgment Summons |volume=15 |page=541 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a [[debtor]] has once been imprisoned, although for a period of less than six weeks, no second order of commitment can be made against him in respect of the same debt. But if the judgment be for payment by instalments a power of committal arises on default of payment for each instalment.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

However, if an order of commitment has never been executed, or becomes inoperative through lapse of time, a fresh commitment may be made.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Imprisonment does not operate as a satisfaction or extinguishment of a debt, or deprive a person of a right of execution against the land or goods of the person imprisoned in the same manner as there had been no imprisonment.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;  In this regard the judgement summons procedure may be seen as a more extreme—because of the threat of imprisonment—version of the procedure under the [[Civil Procedure Rules]]&lt;ref&gt;CPR Part 71&lt;/ref&gt; procedure to obtain information from judgment debtors.

A judgment summons may now be served by post in keeping with other [[Civil Procedure Rules]] actions but, if this option is chosen, then a commitment order cannot be obtained unless: (a) he appears at the hearing; or (b) it is made under section 110(2) of the [[County Courts Act 1984|Act]].&lt;ref&gt;CCR O. 28 r. 2(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications for these are now made under [[County Court]] rules Order 28.  There is a standard Civil Procedure Rules practice form&lt;ref&gt;Form N342&lt;/ref&gt; which may be used to apply for the issue of the summons.  The current fee for issue is £100.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Fees Guide EX50 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The title '''Keeper of the Seals''' or equivalent is used in several contexts, denoting the person entitled to keep and authorize use of the [[Great Seal (disambiguation)|Great Seal]] of a given country. The title may or may not be linked to a particular [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] or [[Minister (government)|ministerial]] office.  This is most often the case today, but in the past the role was often a distinct and important job.

==Canada==
[[Image:Great Seal of Canada.png|thumb|150px|The [[Great Seal of Canada]]]]
The official Keeper of the [[Great Seal of Canada|Great Seal]] of Canada is the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]. At his or her installation, the governor general swears three oaths, one of which is the oath of the office of keeper of the great seal. The seal is also presented to the Governor General who entrusts it back to the registrar general for safekeeping. The seal is actually kept with the [[Registrar General of Canada]], a title which since 1995 has been linked to the office of [[Minister of Industry (Canada)|Minister of Industry]].

Each province since 1869 has its own seal and their keepers are the provincial [[Lieutenant Governor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=7:17AM in SK |url=http://www.ops.gov.sk.ca/Default.aspx?DN=793b8eb3-2f3a-4562-8b1d-b84c1b37e56e |title=Government of Saskatchewan |website=Ops.gov.sk.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Registrar General actually keeps the Great seal of Canada, so the provincial Great Seals are placed by the lieutenant-governors of the provinces into the keeping of the provincial Attorneys-General.

==France==
[[Image:Grand sceau de la République Française image001.gif|thumb|right|150px|The [[Great Seal of France]]]]
The French '''"Keeper of the Seals"''' (''Garde des Sceaux'') is a title held by the [[Minister of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]]. Formerly, as [[Keeper of the Seals of France]], this title belonged to the [[Lord Chancellor of France|Chancellor]], the ''[[ancien régime]]'' counterpart of the minister of justice. The title is nowadays often used interchangeably with "Minister of Justice of France."

The Minister of Justice guards the [[Great Seal of France]], dating from 1848, in his or her office, as well as the stamping press. The Seal was used in 1958 to seal the [[Constitution of France]] and has since been used to seal certain constitutional amendments.

==Italy==
In Italy, the [[Italian Minister of Justice|Minister of Justice]]  assumes the duties of '''''Guardasigilli''''' (Keeper of the Seals).

As ''Guardasigilli'', the Minister of Justice countersigns all laws and decrees signed by the [[President of the Italian Republic|president]] and the decrees issued by other ministries. The Minister of Justice is also the editor of the ''[[Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana]]'', the official bulletin of the [[Italy|Italian Republic]].

==Netherlands==
In the Netherlands, custody of the great seal is held ex-officio by the Minister of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hogeraadvanadel.nl/actueel/nieuws/2016/12/08/bezoek-minister-van-der-steur-aan-de-hoge-raad-van-adel&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
The [[Governor-General of New Zealand]] has custody of the [[Seal of New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;Seal of New Zealand Act 1977, section 4&lt;/ref&gt; However, responsibility for the seal is delegated to the [[Executive Council of New Zealand|Clerk of the Executive Council]].&lt;ref&gt;https://cabguide.cabinetoffice.govt.nz/seal-new-zealand&lt;/ref&gt; The seal is affixed to various instruments that require it.&lt;ref&gt;Seal of New Zealand Act 1977, section 3. "The Seal of New Zealand shall be the seal to be used on any instrument that is made by Her Majesty or Her successors, or by the Governor-General, on the advice of a Minister of Her Majesty's Government in New Zealand or on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council of New Zealand."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Papacy==
In medieval and Renaissance times the Papal ''Piombatore'' ("Keeper of the [[Lead]]") was an important and well-paid office, always held by a [[friar]]. The painter [[Sebastiano del Piombo]] held it from 1531 until his death in 1546, and the nickname he is known by came from his job-title.  He had to take [[holy orders]] for the purpose, despite having a wife and two sons.&lt;ref&gt;Lucco, Mauro, "Sebastiano del Piombo", [[Grove Art Online]], Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 1 Apr. 2017. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T077270 subscription required]&lt;/ref&gt;  The position was usually awarded for life, and in the Renaissance was often given to artists who worked on papal projects.  The important architect [[Bramante]] had been appointed in 1513, but died the next year, when [[Mariano Fetti]] succeeded. He was already a friar, and a sort of court jester, but also an intimate friend to the Medici [[Pope Leo X]].  He held the role under three popes until his death in 1531, when Sebastiano succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1-i6SJTECU0C&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117 ''St. Catherine of Alexandria in Renaissance Roman Art: Case Studies in Patronage''], Dr Cynthia Stollhans, p. 117-120&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Great Seal of the Realm.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The [[Great Seal of the Realm]].]] --&gt;
Several British officials have titles connected to the keeping of seals.

* [[Lord Privy Seal]]: Keeper of the [[Privy Seal]] of England and one of the five [[Great Officers of State]]. Today this a [[sinecure]] office used to bring a person into the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]] as a [[Minister without Portfolio]].  Until the [[English Reformation]] this was usually held by a bishop, the change being marked by [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire]], after his daughter [[Anne Boleyn]] became Queen.
* [[Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland]]: An honor traditionally given to a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[House of Lords|Peer]], vacant since 1922.
* [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor]]: Keeper of the [[Great Seal of the Realm]]. The office today is primarily concerned with the administration of the courts, and is linked by [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] to the office of [[Secretary of State for Justice]]; all Justice Secretaries since the creation of the office have also been appointed Lord Chancellor. Prior to the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], the office had had substantial legislative, executive, and judicial power; the Act stripped the Lord Chancellor non-executive functions (besides sitting in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] when held by an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] or a Peer entitled to a seat in the [[House of Lords|Lords]]). The office's responsibilities had previously not only been those of the chief administrator of the court system but also of [[chairman|presiding officer]] of the [[House of Lords]] (succeeded in that capacity by the [[Lord Speaker]]) and of a judge or judge-like position on several judicial bodies.
* [[Great Seal of Scotland|Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland]]: An official entrusted with the Great Seal of Scotland, generally given to holders of Scotland-specific offices. Currently held ''[[ex officio]]'' by the [[First Minister of Scotland]]. The position also grants the First Minister a position in the [[Order of precedence in Scotland|order of precedence]] by virtue of his or her position as Keeper of the Great Seal. Before the [[Scotland Act 1998]] created the office of First Minister, the position of Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland was generally given to the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]].
* Keeper of the [[Welsh Seal]]: An office created by the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]] that is held ex-officio by the [[First Minister of Wales]]. It grants the minister an official position for purposes of the Order of Precedence. No Welsh Seal had previously existed since those used by the native Princes of Wales.
* [[Duchy of Cornwall|Chancellor of Cornwall]]: Keeper of the Great Seal. Appointed by the Duchy of Cornwall, vacant since 1867.
* [[Duchy of Cornwall|Keeper of the Privy Seal of Cornwall]]: Appointed by the Duchy of Cornwall, vacant since 1933.

==United States==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:US-GreatSeal-Obverse.svg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Great Seal of the United States]].]] --&gt;
The United States [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] is the official keeper of the [[Great Seal of the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;4 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;42 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and the seal may only be affixed to instruments as provided by law or by authorization of the President.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 4 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;42 (2006) ("Except as provided by section 2902 (a) of title 5, the [great] seal shall not be affixed to any instrument without the special warrant of the President therefor.").&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Great Seals listed above, the Great Seal of the United States is the primary graphical emblem of the United States and is used equivalently to a [[coat of arms]].

The [[Seals of the U.S. states|seals of individual U.S. states]] are typically the responsibility of the [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|State Secretary of State]].

'''''Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents''''', 528 U.S. 62 (2000), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that determined that the [[United States Congress|Congress's]] [[congressional power of enforcement|enforcement powers]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] did not extend to the [[abrogation doctrine|abrogation]] of state [[sovereign immunity]] under the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] where the discrimination complained of was rationally based on age.

==Facts and result==
Employees of [[Florida State University]] and [[Florida International University]], including J. Daniel Kimel, Jr., sued under the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]] of 1967 (the ADEA) because failure to adjust pay had a disparate impact on older employees. Wellington Dickson sued his employer, the [[Florida Department of Corrections]], for not promoting him because of his age. Roderick MacPherson and Marvin Narz, who were associate professors at the [[University of Montevallo]] in [[Alabama]], sued under the ADEA law alleging an evaluation system that discriminated against the elderly.  The cases of Kimel, Dickson, MacPherson and Narz were consolidated on appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit]], and remained consolidated when the Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]].

''Kimel'' invalidated the ADEA insofar as it allowed plaintiffs to sue states for [[money damages]].&lt;ref&gt;Although the ''Kimel'' decision bars state employees from suing states for [[money damages]] for age discrimination, it is still possible to sue under ''[[Ex parte Young]]'' (1908) for prospective injunctive relief.  See ''State Police for Automatic Retirement Ass'n v. DiFava'', 317 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 2003); see also ''[[Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett|Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett]]'', 531 U.S. 356, 374 n.9 (2001).  ''Ex parte Young'' allows state officials to be sued for injunctive relief when violating federal law.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal background==
''Kimel'' concerned the ability of Congress to override the states' "sovereign immunity" using its power under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Sovereign immunity is a principle that originally comes from English law and referred to the immunity of the English monarch from suit. Sovereign immunity, according to the Supreme Court in ''[[Hans v. Louisiana]]'' (1890), normally prevents a state from being sued by its own citizens in federal court. This bar against suit, the Court said, came from the Eleventh Amendment, even though the express terms of that amendment provide only that citizens of one state cannot sue another state.

In ''[[Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer]]'' (1976), however, the Court made an exception to that usual rule. ''Fitzpatrick'' held that Congress could use its power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment&amp;mdash;which allows Congress to enforce the substantive terms of the Fourteenth Amendment, including the Equal Protection Clause, by positive legislation&amp;mdash;to override state sovereign immunity. But in 1997, in ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'', the Court limited congressional power to override state sovereign immunity using the Fourteenth Amendment, and for the first time required "congruence and proportionality" between the constitutional wrong and the congressionally enacted remedy to protect constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;521 U.S. 507, 520 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Boerne'' held that it was the Court, and only the Court, that could determine what constituted a constitutional wrong, and that Congress could not permissibly increase the level of constitutional protection beyond that which the Court had recognized.&lt;ref&gt;See 521 U.S. at 528–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, ''Boerne'' interpreted the scope of section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which states, "The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article."

The Court in ''Kimel'' based its decision in large part on ''Boerne''.  The importance of ''Kimel'' was the strict limits it placed on the ability of Congress to abrogate the states' sovereign immunity under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

==Opinion of the Court==
Justice O'Connor, writing for the majority, stated that Congress in enacting the ADEA had properly declared its intent to subject states to suits for money damages by private individuals.  The Court then noted that under the Court's equal protection jurisprudence, "age is not a suspect classification," and laws which classify on the basis of age need only pass the Court's "[[rational basis review]]" test, as opposed to legal classifications based on race or gender, where a "history of purposeful unequal treatment" leads the Court to apply [[strict scrutiny]] to such laws.  The Court then contrasted rational basis review with the ADEA, which prohibits ''all'' employment discrimination on the basis of age, except where age is a "bona fide occupational qualification."&lt;ref&gt;29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(1).&lt;/ref&gt;   The ADEA, the Court concluded, "prohibits substantially more state employment decisions and practices than would likely be held unconstitutional under the applicable equal protection, rational basis standard."  Therefore, the ADEA's remedy failed the "congruence and proportionality" test required by ''Boerne'' and so was not "a valid exercise of constitutional authority" under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

In explaining the application of rational basis review to classifications based on age, the majority stated:

{{quote|Age classifications, unlike governmental conduct based on race or gender, cannot be characterized as "so seldom relevant to the achievement of any legitimate state interest that laws grounded in such considerations are deemed to reflect prejudice and antipathy. ...

States may discriminate on the basis of age without offending the Fourteenth Amendment if the age classification in question is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. The rationality commanded by the Equal Protection Clause does not require States to match age distinctions and the legitimate interests they serve with razorlike precision. ...

Under the Fourteenth Amendment, a State may rely on age as a proxy for other qualities, abilities, or characteristics that are relevant to the State's legitimate interests. The Constitution does not preclude reliance on such generalizations. That age proves to be an inaccurate proxy in any individual case is irrelevant. [W]here rationality is the test, a State does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)}}

Justice Stevens's dissenting opinion said, "There is not a word in the text of the Constitution supporting the Court's conclusion that the judge-made doctrine of sovereign immunity limits Congress' power to authorize private parties, as well as federal agencies, to enforce federal law against the States." Justice Stevens referred to the doctrine of sovereign immunity as expanded by ''[[Seminole Tribe v. Florida]]'' and ''[[Alden v. Maine]]'' as "[[judicial activism]]."

The '''Liberian Constitution of 1847''' was the first [[constitution]] of [[Liberia]]. Largely modeled on the [[Constitution of the United States]], it remained in effect from its adoption on 26 July 1847 until its suspension by the [[People's Redemption Council]] on 12 April 1980.

The Constitution created a [[unitary state]] governed by three [[branches of government]]: the [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislative branch|legislative]] and [[judicial branch]]es. The executive branch was led by the [[President of Liberia]], elected by [[Direct election|popular vote]] of all [[landowner|land-owning]] citizens to a two-year term. Legislative power was held by the [[Legislature of Liberia]], a [[bicameral]] body made up of a [[House of Representatives of Liberia|House of Representatives]] and a [[Senate of Liberia|Senate]]. The judicial branch consisted of the [[Supreme Court of Liberia]], made up of a [[chief justice]] and four [[associate justices]], and [[circuit court]]s created by the Legislature. Article One of the Constitution enshrined [[civil liberties]] similar to those protected by the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in the United States Constitution.

Approved in a [[Liberian constitutional referendum, 1847|referendum]] on 27 September 1847, the Constitution was amended several times from 1847 to 1980. Among these amendments, the term length of the president was extended to four years in 1908, and to eight years in 1934.

Ballot initiatives to repeal LGBT anti-discrimination laws are [[anti-LGBT]] initiatives used to target and repeal [[LGBT]] [[anti-discrimination laws]].

==History==

Jurisdictions in the United States began outlawing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in 1972, when [[East Lansing, Michigan]] passed an ordinance forbidding discrimination based on "affectional or sexual preference".&lt;ref&gt;Faderman, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; In response, opponents began organizing campaigns to place measures on their local ballots to repeal these anti-discrimination laws. The repeal movement found a national spokesperson in [[Anita Bryant]], who helped found—and served as president of—[[Save Our Children]]. Save Our Children organized in [[Florida]] in 1977 in response to the passage by the [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County Commission]] of an anti-discrimination ordinance. Bryant's campaign was successful; the Miami-Dade ordinance was repealed by a greater than two-to-one margin. Repeal campaigns, building on this success, spread nationally and several other ordinances were repealed. In California in 1978, conservative state senator [[John Briggs (politician)|John Briggs]] sponsored [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]], which would have barred gay and lesbian people from working in a public school. The defeat of this measure, and of an ordinance repeal measure in [[Seattle, Washington]] the same day, stalled the momentum of the repeal forces.

[[File:Noon22.jpg|right|thumb|250px|alt=Opponents of Colorado's Amendment 2 at a rally sponsored by the National Organization for Women|Opponents of Colorado's Amendment 2 at a rally sponsored by the [[National Organization for Women]]]]

The mid-1980s and early 1990s saw a resurgence in ballot initiatives, culminating in proposed state constitutional amendments in Oregon and Colorado not only to repeal existing anti-discrimination ordinances but to proactively prohibit the state and any local unit of government within the state from ever passing such an ordinance. Oregon's Measure 9, sponsored by the [[Oregon Citizens Alliance]], failed, but Colorado's Amendment 2 passed. Amendment 2 was declared unconstitutional by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in its 1996 ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'' decision. Oregon and two other states, Idaho and Maine, had initiatives between the passage of Amendment 2 and the Court decision; all three were defeated but many municipalities within Oregon passed local measures.

As the question of [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] has risen to greater prominence, opponents of such marriages have turned their attention to passing constitutional amendments barring individual states from legalizing same-sex marriages or recognizing such marriages performed in other jurisdictions. These amendments are listed [[List of U.S. state constitutional amendments banning same-sex unions by type|here]]. Before the marriage issue arose, some jurisdictions had begun providing limited rights and benefits to same-sex [[Domestic partnership in the United States|domestic partners]]. These ordinances also became targets of repeal efforts, with repeal supporters meeting with less success.

Since the 2015 [[US Supreme Court]] ruling in the case of ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'', the prominence of LGBT anti-discrimination laws became the top priority of [[LGBT rights]] activists. One of the most controversial, recent, and largest repeal effort was [[Houston, Texas Proposition 1, 2015|Proposition 1]] in [[Houston, Texas]].

===Local level===

After failing to pass [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)|Measure 9]] in 1992, OCA turned its attention to passing anti-discrimination bans at the county and municipal level. Couching the debate in terms of forbidding LGBT people from receiving so-called "special rights", OCA sought not only to block ordinances in these communities but to bar them from spending money to "promote homosexuality".&lt;ref name = junction /&gt; OCA was successful in passing over two dozen initiatives. However, in 1993 the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] passed a law prohibiting local governments from considering LGBT rights measures so the ordinances had no legal force.&lt;ref name = org1111&gt;{{cite news

      <comment>The last sentence of the second paragraph read "As of January 2018, it had been ratified by 18 states" (I believe was a typo) but it is later stated that "As of January 2018, 18 states are parties to the treaty" (which is true, according to http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/moon/deposit/desc) so I simply replaced the former with the latter.</comment>

{{International ownership conventions}}
The '''Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies''',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/moon.html Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies]'', Dec. 5, 1979, 1363 U.N.T.S. 3&lt;/ref&gt; better known as the '''Moon Treaty''' or '''Moon Agreement''', is a multilateral [[treaty]] that turns [[jurisdiction]] of all celestial bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. Thus, all activities must conform to international law, including the [[United Nations Charter]].

In practice it is a failed treaty because it has not been ratified by any state that engages in self-launched [[human spaceflight|manned space exploration]] or has plans to do so (e.g. the [[United States]], the larger part of the member states of the [[European Space Agency]], [[Russia]] (former [[Soviet Union]]), [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Japan]]) since its creation in 1979, and thus has a negligible effect on actual spaceflight. As of January 2018, 18 states are parties to the treaty.&lt;ref name=untdb/&gt;

==Provisions==
As a follow-on to the [[Outer Space Treaty]], the Moon Treaty intended to establish a [[regime]] for the use of the Moon and other [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]] similar to the one established for the [[seabed|sea floor]] in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]]. The treaty would apply to the Moon and to other [[celestial bodies]] within the [[Solar System]], other than [[Earth]], including [[orbits]] around or other trajectories to or around them.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The treaty makes a declaration that the Moon should be used for the benefit of all states and all peoples of the international community. It also expresses a desire to prevent the Moon from becoming a source of international conflict. To those ends the treaty does the following:{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

*Bans any military use of celestial bodies, including weapon testing or as military bases.
*Bans all exploration and uses of celestial bodies without the approval or benefit of other states under the [[common heritage of mankind]] principle (article 11).
*Requires that the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] must be notified of all celestial activities (and discoveries developed thanks to those activities).
*Declares all states have an equal right to conduct research on celestial bodies.
*Declares that for any samples obtained during research activities, the state that obtained them must consider making part of it available to all countries/scientific communities for research.
*Bans altering the environment of celestial bodies and requires that states must take measures to prevent accidental contamination of the environments of celestial bodies, including Earth.
*Bans any state from claiming [[sovereignty]] over any territory of celestial bodies.
*Bans any ownership of any extraterrestrial property by any organization or person, unless that organization is international and governmental.
*Requires an [[international regime]] be set up to ensure safe and orderly development and management of the resources and sharing of the benefits from them.

]]

The treaty was finalized in 1979 and, after satisfying the condition requiring 5 ratifying states, it entered into force for the [[ratification|ratifying]] parties in 1984. As of January 2018, 18 states are parties to the treaty,&lt;ref name=untdb/&gt; seven of which ratified the agreement and the rest acceded.&lt;ref name=untdb/&gt;&lt;ref name='UNOOSA'&gt;[http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/publications/ST_SPACE_11_Rev2_Add1E.pdf Status of international agreements relating to activities in outer space as at 1 January 2008] United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Four additional states have signed but not ratified the treaty.&lt;ref name=untdb/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNOOSA"/&gt; The [[L5 Society]] and others successfully opposed ratification of the treaty by the United States Senate.&lt;ref name=oneilchilds&gt;[http://www.nss.org/resources/library/spacemovement/chapter05.htm Chapter 5: O'Neills Children], Reaching for the High Frontier, The American Pro-Space Movement 1972-84, by Michael A. G. Michaud, National Space Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

The objection to the treaty by the spacefaring nations is held to be the requirement that extracted resources (and the technology used to that end) must be shared with other nations. The similar regime in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] is believed to impede the development of such industries on the seabed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote =Assuming that the Moon Treaty has no legal effect because of the non-participation of the Big Three is folly. The shadow of customary law and its ability to creep into the vacuum left vacant by treaty law should not be underestimated. To that end, the most effective way of dealing with the question of the Moon Treaty’s validity is to officially denounce it. However, the realities of international politics and diplomacy will likely preclude such an action. The alternative is to act in a manner contrary to the Moon Treaty, and more importantly not to act in conformity with its precepts and hope that is sufficient to turn back the shadows of the Moon Treaty. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also held a number of positions on the [[Shariah Board]]s of prestigious Islamic institutions,&lt;ref name=TheMuslim500&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheikh Taqi Usmani's Profile|url=http://themuslim500.com/profile/shaykh-muhammad-taqi-usmani|publisher=TheMuslim500.com|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was instrumental in the writing of the [[Hudood Ordinances]] under [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|General Zia ul-Haq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQEHOTzZcXEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=wanted+women+scroggins&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwip9a7b0ZfSAhWry4MKHa3KDrwQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=wanted%20women%20scroggins&amp;f=false|title=Wanted Women: Faith, Lies, and the War on Terror: The Lives of Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Aafia Siddiqui|last=Scroggins|first=Deborah|date=2012-01-17|publisher=Harper Collins|year=|isbn=9780062097958|location=|pages=58|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the brother of Islamic scholars [[Muhammad Rafi Usmani]], Muhammad Wali Razi, and Muhammad Razi Usmani, as well as of the Urdu poet Muhammad Zaki Kaifi. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} He has written translations of the Qur'an in both English and Urdu.&lt;ref name=TheMuslim500/&gt; He was given the title of [[Shaykh al-Islām]] by his teacher [[Mawlana]] Sahban Mahmood.

==Early life==
Muhammad Taqi Usmani was born on 5 October 1943&lt;ref name=fsc&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of Justice Maulana Muhammad Taqi Usmani|publisher=Federal Shariat Court, Pakistan|accessdate=20 July 2017|url=http://federalshariatcourt.gov.pk/images/Former%20CJ_Jug_Reg_Immages/fj6.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; (5 Shawwal 1362 AH) in [[Deoband]], a city in the [[Saharanpur district]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]].&lt;ref name=albalagh&gt;[http://www.albalagh.net/taqi.shtml Profile of Muhammad Taqi Usmani on albalagh.net website], Retrieved 20 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Usmani passed the Fazil-e-Arabi (Arabic language examination) with distinction, administered by the Punjab Board.&lt;ref name=fsc/&gt; In 1959 he graduated from the [[Ulama|`Alim]] course at [[Darul Uloom Karachi]].&lt;ref name="Brian Kettell p 28"&gt;Brian Kettell, Introduction to Islamic Banking and Finance, p 28. {{ISBN|047097804X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ijara&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic Finance Scholars|url=http://ijaraloans.com/?p=91|publisher=IjaraLoans.com|date= 30 June 2014|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then specialised in ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence) under the guidance of his father,&lt;ref name=albalagh/&gt; the Mufti of Darul Uloom Karachi, [[Muhammad Shafi (scholar)|Muhammad Shafi]], receiving his ''Takhassus'' degree (equivalent to a PhD) in ''fiqh'' and ''ifta'' (issuance of Islamic legal opinions) from Darul Uloom Karachi in 1961, earning the title of ''Mufti''. He graduated from the [[University of Karachi]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1964, then received a [[Bachelor of Laws]] with distinction from the University of Karachi in 1967. He received a [[Master of Arts]] in [[Arabic literature]], with distinction, from the [[University of Punjab]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=ijara/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian B. Kettell, Introduction to Islamic Banking and Finance, p 28. {{ISBN|1119990602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usmani received ''ijaza'' to teach hadith from Islamic scholars including [[Muhammad Shafi (scholar)|Muhammad Shafi]], [[Muhammad Idris Kandhlawi]], [[Qari Muhammad Tayyib]], Saleemullah Khan, Mufti Rashid Ahmad Ludhianvi, Sahban Mahmud, Zafar Ahmad Usmani, [[Muhammad Zakariya Kandhalvi]], Hasan al-Mahshat, [[Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghudda]]h, Abi Al-Faid [[:id:Muhammad Yasin Al-Fadani|Muhammad Yasin Al-Fadani]] Ash-[[Shafi'i]], and others.&lt;ref name=albalagh/&gt;

His Teachers also include Mufti Wali Hasan Tonki, the Grand Mufti of Jami' ul Uloom Al-Islamiyyah. He admired the academic methods of [[Mufti]] [[Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghudda]]h, of whom he wrote an Orbituary to after his demise in his Nuqoosh-e-Raftghaan. He is very close friends with his teacher's nephew Dr. 'Abdu-s-Sattar Abu Ghuddah.

In tradition to the scholars of Deoband, recognising the importance of Tasawwuf, he traversed the path under the guidance of his Shaikh Dr. Abdul Hai Arifi and Maulana [[Muhammad Masihullah Khan]]  both khulafa of Hakeemul Ummat Maulana [[Ashraf Ali Thanwi]].&lt;ref name=TheMuslim500/&gt; He is authorized by both of his mentors in Silsila e Ashrafia: Chistiyyah, Naqshbandiyah, Qadiriyah and Suharwardiyah. In addition to his busy schedule he is himself a mentor to numerous spiritual aspirants all over the world, such as Moulana Sheikh Mohammad Luqman Sahib Ji of the renowned Abu Bakr Trust in Walsall, England.

Usmani pioneered the concept of [[Islamic banking]] in Pakistan when he established the [[Meezan Bank]]. Usmani has authored a number of books in Arabic, Urdu, and [[English language|English]] on Islamic topics in addition to a large number of articles on [[Islamic banking]] and [[Islamic finance|finance]] published in a number of journals and magazines. According to ''The Muslim 500'' website, he is a leading scholar of Islamic Finance, "Usmani's chief influence comes from his position as a global authority on the issue of Islamic finance."&lt;ref name=TheMuslim500/&gt;

In March 2004, [[United Arab Emirates]] Vice President and Prime Minister [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]] presented an award to Taqi Usmani in recognition of his lifetime service and achievement in [[Islamic finance]] during the annual ''International Islamic Finance Forum'' (IIFF) in [[Dubai]].{{Citation needed|date= October 2011}}

In accordance with the tradition of the scholars of [[Deoband]] and recognising the importance of ''tasawwuf'', Usmani's ''bay'ah'' was accepted by Abdul Hai Arifi and [[Muhammad Masihullah Khan]]. Usmani is currently a mentor to numerous spiritual aspirants all over the world and delivers weekly lectures on self-improvement at [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] on Sundays between [[Asr|Asr Salaah]] and [[Maghrib|Maghrib Salaah]].&lt;ref name=ashrafiya&gt;[https://www.ashrafiya.com/sayyidi-mawlana-mohammad-taqi-usmani-db/ Profile of Muhammad Taqi Usmani on ashrafiya.com website], Retrieved 23 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

He currently teaches [[Sahih Bukhari|Sahih al-Bukhari]], fiqh, and [[Islamic economics]] at [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] and is known for his ''Islahi Khutbat''. He was a key member of a team of scholars which helped declare [[Ahmadis]] non-Muslims by Pakistan's National Assembly during the era of former Pakistani president, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], in the 1970s. During the presidency of General [[Zia ul Haq]], he was instrumental in drafting laws pertaining to ''[[Hudood]]'', ''[[Qisas]]'' meaning ''retaliation in kind'' or ([[eye for an eye]], and ''[[Diyya]]'' (blood money).

==Views==
Usmani strongly opposes elements of modernity, which he describes as engulfing

&lt;blockquote&gt;"the whole world in the tornado of nudity and obscenity, and has provided an excuse for fornication, and more so it has led under thunder claps to the passage of a bill in the British House of Commons to legalize homosexuality. It is in the shadow of the same modernity that Western women are openly displaying banners on the streets demanding legalization of abortion ....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/IslamAndModernismByMuftiTaqiUsmani/42345132-Islam-and-Modernism_djvu.txt |page=6 |last1=Taqi Usmani |first1=Muhammad |title=Islam and Modernism |accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also strongly supports Pakistan's [[Hudood Ordinances]] he helped write and strongly opposed the [[Women's Protection Bill]], which he believes violates the injunctions of Quran and Sunnah. He thinks it will not provide a great relief to countless women.

At a religious conference in 1984 he urged a more "dynamic attitude" towards the practice of ''[[ijtihad]]'', arguing there is no shortage of fine minds capable of interpreting the sharia, but warning against the contamination of sharia by Western ideas such as the elimination of [[hudood]] penalties such as amputation and [[stoning]].&lt;ref name=kadri-228&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780099523277|pages=228–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usmani&gt;{{cite web|last1=Usmani|first1=Taqi|title=THE ISLAMIC WAY OF LIFE.

== Founding ==
A group of volunteers including an Iowa attorney formed the Iowa/Nebraska Innocence Project in 2005 after meeting the founders of the [[Innocence Project]], Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, and several exonerated people at a national conference. Their goal was to form a local version of the project. By 2007 the Iowa/Nebraska Innocent Project became the Nebraska Innocence Project. The organization is part of the Innocence Network, which is a group of 40 innocence projects across the nation, all working to provide accessible information, consultation on cases, and media resources [[Pro bono|pro-bono]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nebraskainnocenceproject.org/about-2/|title=Innocence Project|last=|first=|date=|website=Innocence Project|publisher=Nebraska Innocence Project|access-date=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
The Nebraska Innocence Project works primarily with cases involving [[Genetic testing|DNA testing]]. According to the New York Innocence Project, more than 75% of people who have been exonerated in the United States through DNA testing, have served in prison on the basis of faulty eyewitness accounts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/nebraska/dna-testing-ordered-in--year-old-omaha-rape-case/article_a4cca32e-f389-5b4c-b94e-cc7bc55ffc8e.html|title=DNA testing ordered in 40-year-old Omaha rape case|last=Beck|first=Margery|date=February 21, 2014|work=Lincoln Journal Star|access-date=March 16, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a recent change to Nebraska state law will allow the project to look at cases not involving DNA such as arson cases, Shaken Baby Syndrome, bite marks, and show print-analysis.&lt;ref name="LincolnJournalStar-NEInnocenceProject-2015" /&gt; The Nebraska Innocence Project relies on the work of volunteers and essentially works without a budget. A partnership between the Nebraska chapter and the Midwest Innocence Project, which launched in October 2015, allows Nebraska to take advantage of the Midwest Innocence Project's paid administration, which they intend to do by hiring a paid legal director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.omaha.com/news/nebraska/nebraska-innocence-project-merges-with-regional-group-plans-to-hire/article_d39fa282-7303-11e5-8927-03a1edba7352.html | title=Nebraska Innocence Project merges with regional group, plans to hire first paid legal director | work=Omaha.com | date=15 October 2015 | accessdate=26 March 2016 | author=Hammel, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; To exonerate wrongfully convicted prisoners, the Nebraska Innocence Project sends requests to the Midwest Innocence Project, based in Kansas City, Missouri who prepares the cases and sends them back to Nebraska for investigation and possible litigation.&lt;ref name="LincolnJournalStar-NEInnocenceProject-2015" /&gt; Legal director, Tricia Bushnell assists the Nebraska chapter by organizing cases and finding experts who could help the case.&lt;ref name="LincolnJournalStar-NEInnocenceProject-2015" /&gt;

== Notable Cases ==

=== Beatrice 6 ===
Commonly referred to the [[Beatrice 6]], a 1985 case in [[Gage County, Nebraska|Gage County]] involved the rape and murder of 68-year-old woman, Helen Wilson, in her apartment. Six people, three men and three women were found guilty of committing the crime.&lt;ref name=LincolnJournalStar-Beatrice6-2014&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://journalstar.com/news/local/911/judge-grants-mistrial-in-beatrice-case/article_867ef362-d50f-5a69-a773-e24775cc6163.html|title=Judge grants mistrial in Beatrice 6 case|last=Pilger|first=Lori|date=January 30, 2014|work=[[Lincoln Journal Star]]|accessdate=March 15, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After surfacing evidence that their conviction was based on coerced confessions and the malpractice of forensics, DNA testing of the original evidence proved their innocence.&lt;ref name=NET-Beatrice6-2015&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://netnebraska.org/article/news/972218/beatrice-6-damage-claim-case-returns-federal-court|title=Beatrice 6 Damage Claim Case Returns to Federal Court|last=Kelly|first=Bill|date=May 8, 2015|work=[[Nebraska Educational Telecommunications|Nebraska Educational Telecommunications (NET)]]|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA evidence was the first to be used as means to exonerate someone in the state of Nebraska.&lt;ref name=NET-Beatrice6-2015 /&gt; The six were awarded between $35,000-$500,00 by the state of Nebraska for their wrongful conviction under the Wrongful Conviction Act.

=== Juneal Pratt ===
In 1975 Juneal Pratt was convicted of rape, sexual assault and robbery of two sisters from Iowa in an Omaha motel. At 19 he was arrested and was picked from a lineup by the two sisters months later despite witnesses who claimed he was at home at the time of the crime. He was sentenced to 32 to 90 years in prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pratt has since maintained his innocence and requested DNA testing after a 2001 Nebraska law was passed that  allows convicted felons to request DNA testing of preserved evidence if such technology was unavailable during their trial.

'''Nepal Financial Reporting Standards''' ('NFRS') are designed as a common global language for business affairs so that company accounts are understandable and comparable within Nepal. The rules to be followed by accountants to maintain books of accounts which is comparable, understandable, reliable and relevant as per the users internal or external.

NFRS was issued by [[Nepal Accounting Standard Board]] in 2013. Earlier it has issued Nepal Accounting Standards. NFRS is prepared in line with on IFRS.

==Objective of financial statements==

Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial positions and financial performance of an entity. The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions.

To meet this objective, financial statements provide information about an entity's:
*     assets;
*     liabilities;
*     equity;
*     income and expenses, including gains and losses;
*     contributions by and distributions to owners in their capacity as owners; and
*     cash flows.
This information, along with other information in the notes, assists users of financial statements in predicting the entity's future cash flows and, in particular, their timing and certainty.

The following are the general features in NFRS:
* Fair presentation and compliance with NFRS:
Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of the transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the Framework of NFRS.
* Going concern: 
Financial statements are present on a going concern basis unless management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
* Accrual basis of accounting: 
An entity shall recognise items as assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses when they satisfy the definition and recognition criteria for those elements in the Framework of NFRS.
* Materiality and aggregation: 
Every material class of similar items has to be presented separately. Items that are of a dissimilar nature or function shall be presented separately unless they are immaterial.
* Offsetting
Offsetting is generally forbidden in NFRS.
* Frequency of reporting: 
NFRS requires that at least annually a complete set of financial statements is presented.
* Comparative information: 
NFRS requires entities to present comparative information in respect of the preceding period for all amounts reported in the current period's financial statements. In addition comparative information shall also be provided for narrative and descriptive information if it is relevant to understanding the current period's financial statements.
* Consistency of presentation: 
NFRS requires that the presentation and classification of items in the financial statements is retained from one period to the next unless: 
(a)     it is apparent, following a significant change in the nature of the entity's operations or a review of its financial statements, that another presentation or classification would be more appropriate having regard to the criteria for the selection and application of accounting policies.
(b)     an NFRS standard requires a change in presentation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12567">{{Net neutrality}}
On June 4, 2012,&lt;ref name=stb-2012-235/&gt; the [[Netherlands]] became the first country in Europe and the second in the world, after Chile,&lt;ref name=guardian20110623/&gt; to enact a [[Net neutrality|network neutrality]] law.&lt;ref name=eff20120521/&gt; The main net neutrality provision of this law requires that "Providers of public electronic communication networks used to provide Internet access services as well as providers of Internet access services will not hinder or slow down services or applications on the Internet".&lt;ref name=Telecommunicatiewet7.4a/&gt;

== History ==
The [[Telecoms Package|2009 EU Telecoms Package]] left much leeway for member states to implement their own [[net neutrality]] directives. The first proposal by the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Netherlands)|Minister of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation]] was submitted to the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] on November 3, 2010.&lt;ref name=kst-32549/&gt;

In April 2011, Dutch telecommunications company [[KPN]] announced that it would start to block services such as [[VoIP]] and [[instant messaging]] unless customers paid a fee.&lt;ref name=nu20110421/&gt; Later that week, [[Vodafone]] said it was already blocking those services.&lt;ref name=nu20110423/&gt; During an investors meeting in May, KPN admitted to using [[deep packet inspection]].&lt;ref name=wsj20110512/&gt; These events accelerated the implementation of [[net neutrality]], as a house majority was against the blocking of specific [[Internet]] services.&lt;ref name=nu20110426/&gt;

On June 22, 2011, the house voted for the amendment of the Telecommunications Act with [[net neutrality]] regulations.&lt;ref name=bof20110622/&gt; The [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] mistakenly voted for an amendment supported by the Christian parties [[Reformed Political Party|SGP]], [[ChristianUnion|CU]] and [[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]] that would allow filtering by [[ISP]]s for ideological reasons.&lt;ref name=nos20110621/&gt; A rectification was later plugged into an unrelated amendment.&lt;ref name=isptoday20110705/&gt;

The amendment was passed by the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]] in 2012, and with the publication of the amendment&lt;ref name=stb-2012-235/&gt; and the [[Rectification (law)|rectification]]&lt;ref name=stb-2012-231/&gt; in the official journal of the [[Netherlands]] on June 4 and June 5, respectively, network neutrality became the law.

== Overview ==
Article 7.4a of the Telecommunications Act&lt;ref name=Telecommunicatiewet7.4a/&gt; prohibits the hindrance or slowing down of [[Internet#Services|services]] or [[Application software|applications]] on the [[Internet]] by [[ISP]]s and network owners. Deviation from this rule is only allowed:

* to reduce [[Network congestion|congestion]], while treating similar traffic equally;
* to preserve the [[Data integrity|integrity]] and [[Computer security|security]] of the network and service of the provider or the equipment of the [[end-user]];
::If the breach of integrity or security is caused by the equipment of the end-user, the provider has to notify the end-user first and give them sufficient time to rectify the situation.
* to block the transmission of [[Spam (electronic)|unwanted communications (e.g. spam)]] to an end-user, only if the end-user has given consent beforehand; or
* to comply with the law or a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]].

Also, it is prohibited for [[ISP]]s to charge end-users differently for the use of different types of Internet services or applications. Finally, future executive orders can institute minimum quality requirements to prevent the deterioration, hindrance, or slowing down of network communications.

== Criticism and impact ==
{{outdated|date=January 2017}}
The director of the former Independent Post and Telecommunications Authority ({{lang-nl|Onafhankelijke Post en Telecommunicatie Autoriteit}} "[[Onafhankelijke Post en Telecommunicatie Autoriteit|OPTA]]"), now part of the Consumer and Markets Authority, has criticized the current implementation of net neutrality by the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=webwereled20120614/&gt; He questions whether the consumer actually benefits from the regulations, since it has become very hard for providers to offer a variety of services because of the restrictions posed on providers. He favors [[Transparency (market)|transparency]] and [[Competition (economics)|competition]] instead of strict regulation.

[[Neelie Kroes]], a Dutch politician and the former [[European Commissioner for Digital Agenda]], also supported [[consumer choice]]: "If consumers want to obtain discounts because they only plan to use limited online services, why stand in their way?"&lt;ref name=kroes20120529/&gt; She recognized a need for greater transparency in what services providers do and do not provide, and what limitations there are: "consumers also need to know if they are getting Champagne or lesser sparkling wine. If it is not full Internet, it shouldn't be marketed as such; perhaps it shouldn't be marketed as 'Internet' at all, at least not without any upfront qualification." She also criticized uncoordinated country-by-country legislation, because it slows down the creation of a "Digital Single Market".

The Dutch approach to net neutrality received large attention in Brazil and served as an important reference during the negotiations of the [[Marco Civil da Internet]], the country's Internet Civil Rights Law, approved by the Chamber of Deputies' in March, 2014.&lt;ref name=techdirt20140326/&gt;

On April 3, 2014, upon strong support of Commissioner Kroes, the European Parliament voted in favor of maintaining net neutrality throughout European networks. The position might become law, if approved by the European Commission in the upcoming months.&lt;ref name=reuters20140403/&gt;

As of September 2017, Ziggo and XS4All are once again ordered to block The Pirate Bay, this time by the Dutch Court. If the Supreme Court orders this block to stay permanent, it could possibly lead to other sites being blocked thus nullifying the status of Net Neutrality in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2017/09/ziggo-xs4all-told-to-block-the-pirate-bay-ahead-of-supreme-court-ruling/|title=Ziggo, XS4All told to block The Pirate Bay ahead of Supreme Court ruling - DutchNews.nl|date=2017-09-22|work=DutchNews.nl|access-date=2017-10-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://torrentfreak.com/block-the-pirate-bay-within-10-days-dutch-court-tells-isps-170922/|title=Block The Pirate Bay Within 10 Days, Dutch Court Tells ISPs - TorrentFreak|date=2017-09-22|work=TorrentFreak|access-date=2017-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4339">A '''nuclear gypsy''' is a temporary worker who performs the least desirable work in the [[nuclear power]] industry.

Japanese writer [[Kunio Horie]] gave this name to "contract workers who have traditionally performed the dirtiest, most dangerous jobs for Japan's power utilities."&lt;ref name=McCurry&gt;{{cite news|last=McCurry|first=Justin|title=Fukishima cleanup recruits 'nuclear gypsies' from across Japan|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/13/fukushima-nuclear-gypsies-engineers-labourers|date=July 13, 2011|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term became more widely used after the 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]], the Japanses nuclear industry has used such contracted maintenance and sanitary workers since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=McCurry /&gt;&lt;ref name=Alecci&gt;{{cite news|last=Alecci|first=
Scilla|title=Japan: A Nuclear Gypsy’s Tale |work=Global Voices|url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/08/03/japan-a-nuclear-gypsy%E2%80%99s-tale/|date=August 3, 2011|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Week"&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|title=Fukushima's 'nuclear gypsies' Thousands of unskilled workers are toiling at Japan's tsunami-ravaged nuclear plant, risking radiation exposure for $127 a day |work=The Week|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/217202/fukushimas-nuclear-gypsies|date=July 14, 2011|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is used with contempt for transient workers, based on the derogatory name for the [[Romani people]].&lt;ref name=Alecci /&gt;  Also called a ''jumper'', nuclear gypsies move from one temporary assignment to another nuclear power plant.&lt;ref name=Glionna&gt;{{cite news|first=John M.|last=Glionna|title=Japan's 'nuclear gypsies' face radioactive peril at power plants: Unskilled contractors make up most of the workforce and face higher doses of radiation than utility employees at Fukushima and other nuclear power plants in Japan|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/04/world/la-fg-japan-nuclear-gypsies-20111204 |date=December 4, 2011|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are "construction workers, truck drivers, and unemployed men ... [s]ome ... recruited from day-labor centers where jobless people gather hoping to find work." About a hundred subcontractors employ about 3,000 workers, compared to about 400 workers directly employed by [[Tokyo Electric Power Company|TEPCO]].&lt;ref name="The Week" /&gt;
 
These temporary workers often have several [[Motivation|motives]] for working under dangerous conditions, which may be high in [[radioactivity]]:&lt;ref name=Alecci /&gt;&lt;ref name=Glionna /&gt; most often cited are "high wages and a sense of duty", but they also do not comprehend the grave risks involved.&lt;ref name=McCurry /&gt;  For example, one worker interviewed by ''The Guardian'' worked temporarily to assist his mother financially, which paid more than [[truck driving]], but he did not realise until after the project completed that he'd been exposed to twice the [[radiation dose]] allowed by law.&lt;ref name=McCurry /&gt;  Like all those who depend on casual work for survival, some workers may have [[alcohol abuse]] or have other personal issues that make them unsuitable for permanent work.&lt;ref name=Glionna /&gt;  After a 1992 recession, some workers jumped for scarce work at the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant|Fukushima nuclear power plant]].&lt;ref name=Glionna /&gt;  In 2011, they were paid the equivalent of $127 per day—much more than many other [[unskilled labor]] jobs, but a fraction of what the TEPCO staff earned.&lt;ref name="The Week" /&gt;

Other [[Workplace stress|hassles]] are the heat, stifling uniforms, and poor food served in the [[Company store|company mess]].&lt;ref name=McCurry /&gt;  There had been insufficient "rest areas ... water coolers, and ... coolant vests to prevent heatstroke," but those problems now are being remedied.&lt;ref name="The Week" /&gt;

Dobyns, '''The Patent Office Pony; A History of the Early Patent Office''']&lt;/ref&gt;  These include:

*The examination of [[patent application]]s prior to issuing a [[patent]].  This was the second time this was done anywhere in the world. The only other time{{where|date=December 2011}} an examination period existed prior to this act was in the United States from 1790 to 1793 under the [[Patent Act of 1790]]. Prior to this, patents were issued on all applications, even if they were direct copies of earlier patents.&lt;ref&gt;Waltersheid, Edward C. (1998) ''To Promote the Progress of Useful Arts, American Patent Law and Administration'' Littleton: Rothman pp 3.&lt;/ref&gt; It was left to the courts to decide validity in the event of a lawsuit.
*The option of extending an existing patent's term for an additional seven years, making the maximum term of patent 21 years. (This was abolished in 1861 and replaced with a single 17-year term.)
*The hiring of professional [[patent examiner]]s.  Initially only one examiner was hired, but soon a second one was hired to handle the increased workload.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
*The establishment of a library of [[prior art]] to assist in examinations.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The legal term '''peace'''  – sometimes '''King's peace''', '''Queen's peace''' or '''peace of the state''' – is, or has been, used in the [[legal system]]s of many countries to describe specific protections that a [[system of justice]], [[head of state]] or [[legislature]] provides to persons who are within the boundaries of a specific area (e.g. a [[courtroom]] or [[national borders]]).

In this sense, peace is most commonly used in the [[United Kingdom]] and other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, as well as [[former British colonies]] with [[common law]] traditions.

==History &amp; etymology==
By [[late antiquity]], many [[Germanic peoples]] had the concept of an "enclosure of the peace", i.e. a "sanctuary", "refuge" or "asylum, , such as the modern [[german language|German]] word ''Einfriedung'' , usually translated as "enclosure". The German root ''-fried-'' shares the [[Proto-Germanic]] root ''frijaz'' as the archaic English [[frith]] , meaning "peace, tranquility", "security, refuge” ,  modern English "free", old German terms for "fence" or "guard", and the modern German word for "peace" ''Friede''.  Likewise, the Old English term [[fredum]], a fine paid for "breaking the peace" is sometimes still used in legal circles.

[[Ancient Romans]] used the Latin ''pax'' "peace" for domestic peace, international peace, and "peace with the gods". All three were implied by the ideology of  ''[[Pax Romana]]'' in the Roman Empire era.
  
==Usage in British Law==
===Duty of the Crown to maintain peace===
Maintenance of the Queen's peace is one of the duties of [[the Crown]], carried out via the [[Royal Prerogative]]. Though this power remains the Crown's, through [[Convention (norm)#Government|convention]] it is exercised by the [[Queen-in-Council]]; that is, the executive, or, the sovereign acting on the [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] of her [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]].

The Crown can be held responsible should it fail in upholding its duty to maintain peace; this was the justification for the [[Riot Act]] and subsequent legislation throughout the [[British Empire]]. Where civil authorities had declared the Queen's peace as breached (i.e. there was a state of [[riot]]), there was a change in the rules: the authorities (whether police, army, or militia providing [[Military Aid to the Civil Power|military aid to the civil power]]) could shoot and kill the leaders of the riot, and generally take severe action against anyone who was rioting. The counterbalance was that the Crown was responsible for damage caused by the riot, having failed in its duty to preserve the peace. Into the present day, the criminal offence of rioting can only be prosecuted as such with the consent of the [[Attorney-General]] (the Queen's legal officer). If disorder does occur but is not prosecuted as rioting, it is officially called a ''civil disturbance'', as deeming it a riot transfers the liability of insurers for any damages or injury occurring from such an event to the local police, which, as they are officers of the Crown, makes the Crown liable to pay.

===Enforcement===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
Officers of the Queen's peace have the right to detain a person who is creating a ''[[breach of the peace]]''. This is not a criminal or civil offence; it exists as a legal oddity created by the Royal Prerogative. Persons so detained must be taken before a magistrate (a Justice of the Peace), who will [[binding over|bind them over]] to keep the peace, whereafter the person may not disturb the peace again for the appointed time, under threat of imprisonment. The police will frequently use this power to break up difficult situations or minor fights; often, a perpetrator will be detained only briefly, until the officers are satisfied that the fight is over. Alternatively, if [[alcohol]] is present, for instance, the offender can be held until [[Sobriety|sober]] enough to face the magistrate. Because a breach of the Queen's peace is not a criminal offence, people found to have broken it will not have the charge marked on their [[criminal record]].

Murder remains a [[common law]] offence, defined as "When a man of sound memory and of the age of discretion unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being and under the King's peace, with malice aforethought, either expressed or implied by law, the death taking place within a year and a day." (Russell on Crime, 12th Edition, 1964) However, the Queen's peace excludes killing of the enemy during a war.

===Justice of the Peace===
Historically, and in particular before the founding of the [[police]] and the modern legal system, the concept of the Queen's peace was much more important. Knights of the Peace were appointed in each [[shire]], and it was their duty to maintain the Queen's peace. These Knights of the Peace later became known as ''[[Justices of the Peace]]'', or ''JPs'', and subsequently as [[magistrate]]s. In the United Kingdom, paid magistrates are now called ''District Judges'', and are drawn from the ranks of local [[solicitor]]s and [[barrister]]s. Unpaid magistrates are volunteers from the community{{spaced ndash}}the requirements are that they must be of good character and local residence.

===Influence of UK concept on other legal systems===
In the United States, arrest warrants and charging documents, such as [[indictment]]s, are often constitutionally required to make reference to an offense having occurred "against the peace and dignity of" the respective state or commonwealth.

In the [[county palatine]] areas of the United Kingdom{{spaced ndash}}the Duchies of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[Duchy of Cornwall|Cornwall]], and the [[County Palatine of Durham]]{{spaced ndash}}offences such as murder were deemed to be against the respective bishop's or duke's peace (the [[Duke of Lancaster]] being merged with the Crown, but nevertheless a separate office, and the [[Duke of Cornwall]] being the [[Heir to the Throne]]). This, however, was altered in 1536.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/DisplayCatalogueDetails.asp?CATID=91&amp;CATLN=1&amp;FullDetails=True&amp;j=1 The National Archives | The Catalogue | Full Details]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, the company filed for bankruptcy due to [[liquidity]] problems.&lt;ref name=apr/&gt;

==History==
Pescanova was founded in 1960 by [[José Fernández López]], who established the company in [[Vigo]]. From its beginnings Pescanova introduced cutting-edge technology for the complete activity of fish processing, best defined by the [[factory ship]] which was not common in Spain at the time. The business model worked and allowed a continued growth making it one of the biggest firms in the [[fishing industry]].

In 1980 [[Manuel Fernández de Sousa-Faro]], the son of the founder, took over the presidency and, after a period of restructuring, Pescanova became a multinational empire. In 1985 it joined [[Madrid Stock Exchange]].

With more than 120 fishing boats and 150,000 tons of fish products sold into the global market every year, Pescanova is among the top 5 companies in its sector. Besides the Spanish facilities, the company has production plants in 21 countries,&lt;ref name=upi/&gt; amongst which are [[Portugal]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Namibia]] and [[Honduras]].  It had in 2013 approximately 3,400 employees.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;

On 15 April 2013, Pescanova filed in Spanish court for bankruptcy protection. The insolvency filing mentions debts of 1.5bn euros, but financial sources who have had dealings with the company say total debt is probably more than double that amount, potentially making it the country's third-largest bankruptcy.  The court accepted the filing and said it would name independent administrators to replace the board.  Pescanova revealed only on the day of the insolvency filing that Fernandez Sousa had sold half his 14.4 percent stake in the company in the months leading up to the filing without telling regulators, as required by law.&lt;ref name=apr&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/26/us-spain-pescanova-insight-idUSBRE93P06020130426 reuters.com: "Insight: Failure of Spain's Pescanova lifts lid on culture of secrecy"], 26 Apr 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The multinational empire had by January 2014 an accumulated debt of $5.8bn euros, according to Spain's National Securities Market Commission (CNMV).&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;  In January 2014, three multinational investment funds were interested to refloat the bankrupt company with approximately 300m euros.  The company operated under court protection while arrangements were made.  The interested investors are consortia of&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.mercopress.com/2014/01/13/three-investment-funds-interested-in-recapitalization-of-bankrupt-pescanova mercopress: "Three investment funds interested in recapitalization of bankrupt Pescanova" 14 Jan 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[S.A. Damm|Damm]], [[Luxempart]], [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]] and [[Ergon Capital Partners]];
# [[Centerbridge]] and [[Bluecrest]] [[vulture funds]],
# the major domestic creditor banks - [[Banco Sabadell]], [[Banco Popular]], [[NCG Banco]], [[Bankia]], [[CaixaBank]], [[Grupo Santander|Santander]] and [[BBVA]]

The current board and management were opposed by minority shareholders.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt; A director of Pescanova, [[Luis Angel Sanchez Merlo]], resigned on 14 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fis.com/fis/companies/details.asp?l=e&amp;filterby=companies&amp;=&amp;country_id=&amp;page=1&amp;company_id=23019&amp;submenu=cpp fis.com: Pescanova SA, company news, "Pescanova adviser resigns" 14 Jan 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously, negotiations were under way to separate Pesca Chile from the others through an offer by [[Cooke Aquaculture]] of Canada and [[Econsult]] of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=upi&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2014/01/13/Canada-eyes-Chilean-arm-of-troubled-Spanish-fishery-firm/UPI-77481389664245/ upi.com: "Canada eyes Chilean arm of troubled Spanish fishery firm" 13 Jan 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2014, Pescanova disclosed a new set of over 2bn euros outstanding loans to its restructuring committee.
The loans are trading at about 12 cents on the euro while 160mn euros of its convertible bonds are quoted at about 14 cents. Lenders were willing to accept losses of 60 percent on the debt in exchange for a 90 percent stake in the [[Pontevedra]], Spain-based business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-17/pescanova-hidden-debt-lenders-face-90-losses-corporate-finance bloomberg.com: "Pescanova Hidden Debt Lenders Face 90% Losses: Corporate Finance"], 17 Feb 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2014, the major domestic creditor banks agreed to lift the bankruptcy, and the company remained as one of the Galician multinationals.  Damm and Luxempart were sidelined, and as a result, Jose Carceller of Damm and Francois Tesch of Luxempart resigned from the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undercurrentnews.com/2014/05/02/pescanova-restructuring-plan-officially-approved-with-63-65-creditors-support/ undercurrentnews.com: "Pescanova restructuring plan officially approved with 63% creditor support"], 2 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-01/pescanova-seen-winning-creditor-vote-for-bank-led-restructuring bloomberg.com: "Pescanova Seen Winning Creditor Vote for Debt Restructuring"], 1 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2014, Pescanova exited bankruptcy proceedings after 403 days. The restructuring plan had received support from 65% of its major domestic creditor banks.  The company was to continue under administration by [[Deloitte]], until the subsequent shareholders’ meeting.  On 22 May 22, Deloitte reported to the Spanish financial regulator CNMV the resignation of [[Juan Manuel Urgoiti]], who had been chairman of the Spanish multinational since September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undercurrentnews.com/2014/05/23/pescanova-officially-out-of-bankruptcy-after-403-days/ undercurrentnews.com: "Pescanova officially out of bankruptcy, after 403 days"], 23 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2015, Manuel Fernandez Sousa-Faro was chastised because of his failure to report a number of properties to the Court, which had fined him for his role in the collapse of Pescanova.  In January 2014, Fernandez had been condemned, along with colleagues Carlos Turci, Alfonso Garcia and Angel Gonzales, Alfonso Paz-Andrade, Fernando Fernandez, Robert Albert Williams, Antonio Taboas, Joaquin Vina, Alfredo Lopez and ICS Holding Limited, for their contributions to the collapse of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undercurrentnews.com/2015/01/08/former-pescanova-chairman-omitted-patrimony-unwittingly-to-pay-imposed-fines/ undercurrentnews.com: "Former Pescanova chairman omitted patrimony ‘unwittingly’ to pay imposed fines"], 8 Jan 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 February 2015, the company reported profits of 1.6bn euros, which contrasted with losses one year earlier that totalled 718mn euros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undercurrentnews.com/2015/02/02/pescanova-reverses-losses-with-e1-6m-net-profit/ undercurrentnews.com: "Pescanova reverses losses, ups operating profit"], 2 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  By 6 February 2015, New York-based hedge fund [[Broadbill Investment Partners]] had acquired 3.69% of Pescanova, according to records of the Spanish financial regulator [[CNMV]].  The financial regulator showed Pescanova's former chairman [[Manuel Fernandez de Sousa]] as the company's largest shareholder with 7.5% of shares, followed by the Spanish heiress [[Carolina Herrero Masaveu]], with 7.1% and Spanish brewery [[S.A. Damm|Damm]], which lost its bid to control the fishing giant the previous year, with 6.2%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undercurrentnews.com/2015/02/06/us-investment-fund-buys-stake-in-pescanova/ undercurrentnews.com: "US investment fund buys stake in Pescanova"], 6 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Any piece of real estate can be the subject of a Phase I ESA.]]

In the United States, an '''environmental site assessment''' is a report prepared for a real estate holding that identifies potential or existing environmental contamination [[Legal liability|liabilities]].  The analysis, often called an '''ESA''', typically addresses both the underlying land as well as physical improvements to the property. A proportion of contaminated sites are "[[brownfield site]]s."  In severe cases, brownfield sites may be added to the [[National Priorities List]] where they will be subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's [[Superfund]] program. 
 
The actual sampling of soil, air, groundwater and/or building materials is typically not conducted during a Phase I ESA.   The Phase I ESA is generally considered the first step in the process of environmental [[due diligence]]. Standards for performing a Phase I site assessment have been promulgated by the US EPA&lt;ref name = "Final Rule"&gt;[http://epa.gov/brownfields/aai/aai_final_rule.pdf EPA Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries -Final Rule]&lt;/ref&gt; and are based in part on [[ASTM]] in Standard E1527-13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/E1527.htm|title= ASTM Standard E1527-13 for Phase I ESAs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a site is considered contaminated, a Phase II environmental site assessment may be conducted, ASTM test E1903, a more detailed investigation involving chemical analysis for hazardous substances and/or petroleum hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/E1903.htm|title= ASTM Standard E1903 for Phase II ESAs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As early as the 1970s specific property purchasers in the United States undertook studies resembling current Phase I ESAs, to assess risks of ownership of commercial properties which had a high degree of risk from prior toxic [[chemical]] use or disposal. Many times these studies were preparatory to understanding the nature of cleanup costs if the property was being considered for [[redevelopment]] or change of [[land use]].

In the [[United States of America]] demand increased dramatically for this type of study in the 1980s following judicial decisions related to liability of property owners to effect site cleanup.  Interpreting the [[Superfund|Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980]] (CERCLA), the U.S. courts have held that a buyer, lessor, or lender may be held responsible for [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of hazardous substance residues, even if a prior owner caused the contamination; performance of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, according to the courts' reasoning, creates a [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]], known as the 'Innocent Landowner Defense'.

In 1998 the necessity of performing a Phase I ESA was underscored by congressional action in passing the [[Superfund Cleanup Acceleration Act of 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;''Superfund Cleanup Acceleration Act of 1998'', U.S. Congress, March 26, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  This act requires purchasers of commercial property to perform a Phase I study meeting the specific standard of [[ASTM]] E1527: Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process.

The most recent standard is "Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries" 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 312&lt;ref name = "Final Rule" /&gt; which drew heavily from ASTM E1527-13, which is the ASTM Standard for conducting 'All Appropriate Inquiry' (AAI) for the environmental assessment of a real property.  Previous guidances regarding the ASTM E1527 standard were ASTM E1527-97, ASTM E1527-00, and ASTM E1527-05.

Residential property purchasers need only conduct a site inspection and chain of title survey.

==Triggering actions==
A variety of reasons for a Phase I study to be performed exist, the most common being:&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M Missimer and Missimer M Missimer, ''A Lender's Guide to Environmental Liability Management'' [[CRC Press]] (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Purchase of [[real property]] by a person or entity not previously on [[title (property)|title]].
* Contemplation by a new lender to provide a loan on the subject [[real estate]].
* Partnership buyout or principal redistribution of ownership.
* Application to a [[government agency|public agency]] for change of use or other discretionary land use permit.
* Existing property owner's desire to understand toxic history of the property.
* Compulsion by a regulatory agency who suspects toxic conditions on the site.
* Divestiture of properties

==Scope==
Scrutiny of the land includes examination of potential [[soil contamination]], [[groundwater]] quality, [[surface water]] quality and sometimes issues related to hazardous substance uptake by [[biota (ecology)|biota]].  The examination of a site may include: definition of any chemical residues within structures; identification of possible [[asbestos]] containing [[building material]]s; inventory of [[hazardous]] substances stored or used on site; assessment of [[mold]] and [[mildew]]; and evaluation of other [[indoor air quality]] parameters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sara N Martin]], ''[[Site Assessment and Remediation Handbook]]'', [[CRC Press]] (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Asbestos fibres.jpg|thumb|200px|Asbestos-containing materials are not typically surveyed or sampled in a Phase I site inspection, but suspect building materials may be noted]]

Depending upon precise protocols utilized, there are a number of variations in the scope of a Phase I study.  The tasks listed here are common to almost all Phase I ESAs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apex-enviro.com/faq.html#1|title= Components of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Performance of an on-site visit to view present conditions (chemical spill residue, die-back of [[vegetation]], etc.); hazardous substances or petroleum products usage (presence of above ground or [[underground storage tank]]s, storage of [[acid]]s, etc.);  and evaluate any likely environmentally hazardous site history.
*Evaluation of risks of neighboring properties upon the subject property
*Review of Federal, State, Local and Tribal Records out to distances specified by the ASTM 1528 and AAI Standards (ranging from 1/8 to 1 mile depending on the database)
* Interview of persons knowledgeable regarding the property history (past owners, present owner, key site manager, present tenants, neighbors).
*Examine municipal or county planning files to check prior land usage and permits granted
*Conduct file searches with public agencies (State water board, [[fire department]], county health department, etc.) having oversight relative to [[water quality]] and [[soil contamination]] issues.
*Examine historical [[aerial photography]] of the vicinity.
*Examine current [[USGS]] maps to scrutinize drainage patterns and [[topography]].
*Examine chain-of-title for Environmental Liens and/or Activity and Land Use Limitations (AULs).

In most cases, the public file searches, historical research and chain-of-title examinations are outsourced to information services that specialize in such activities. Non-Scope Items in a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment can include visual inspections or records review searches for:

*Asbestos Containing Building Materials (ACBM)
*Lead-Based Paint
*Lead in Drinking Water
*Mold
*Radon
*Wetlands
*Threatened and Endangered Species
*Mercury poisoning
*Debris flow
*Earthquake Hazard

Often a multi-disciplinary approach is taken in compiling all the components of a Phase I study, since skills in [[chemistry]],  [[atmosphere|atmospheric physics]], [[geology]], [[microbiology]]  and even [[botany]] are frequently required.  Many of the preparers are [[environmental scientist]]s who have been trained to integrate these diverse disciplines.  Many states have professional registrations which are applicable to the preparers of Phase I ESAs; for example, the state of  [[California]] had a registration entitled "California Registered Environmental Assessor Class I or Class II" until July 2012, when it removed this REA certification program due to budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/REA/DTSC California ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under ASTM E 1527-13 parameters were set forth as to who is qualified to perform Phase I ESAs. An Environmental Professional is someone with{{citation needed||date=February 2017}} 
# a current Professional Engineer's or Professional Geologist's license or registration from a state or U.S. territory with 3 years equivalent full-time experience;
# have a Baccalaureate or higher degree from an accredited institution of higher education in a discipline of engineering or science and 5 years equivalent full-time experience; or
# have the equivalent of 10 years full-time experience.

A person not meeting one or more of those qualifications may assist in the conduct of a Phase I ESA if the individual is under the supervision or responsible charge of a person meeting the definition of an Environmental Professional when concluding such activities.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

Most site assessments are conducted by private companies independent of the owner or potential purchaser of the land.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

==Examples==
While there are myriad sites that have been analyzed to date within the United States, the following list will serve as examples of the subject matter:

*[[Auke Bay]] U.S. Postal Facility, [[Juneau, Alaska]]
*Esso Canada Ltd. Former Bulk Fuels Facility, [[Owen Sound]], [[Ontario]], Canada
*[[Dakin Building]], [[Brisbane, California]]
*East Elk Grove Specific Plan, Elk Grove, California
*Mariners Marsh Park, [[Staten Island]], [[New York City|New York]]
*Richmond State Hospital Farm Industrial Park, [[Wayne County, Indiana]]
*Sydney Steel Plant Lands, [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]]
*[[Weyerhauser]] Technology Center, [[Federal Way, Washington]]

==International context==
In Japan, with the passage of the 2003 ''Soil Contamination Countermeasures Law'', there is a strong movement to conduct Phase I studies more routinely.  At least one jurisdiction in Canada ([[Ontario]]) now requires the completion of a Phase I prior to the transfer of some types of industrial properties.  Some parts of Europe began to conduct Phase I studies on selected properties in the 1990s, but still lack the comprehensive attention given to virtually all major real estate transactions in the USA.

In the United Kingdom contaminated land regulation is outlined in the [[Environment Act 1995]]. The [[Environment Agency]] of England and Wales have produced a set of guidance; CLEA a standardized approach to the assessment of land contamination. A Phase 1 Desktop Study is often required in support of a planning application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southwest-environmental.co.uk/Deskto%20Study_copy(1).html Desktop Study Reports (Phase 1)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK these reports must be assembled by a "competent person".

==Other environmental site assessment types==
[[File:Hazardous-pesticide.jpg|thumb|left|Storage and handling of toxics is assessed for each site within a Phase I study.]]

There are several other report types that have some resemblance in name or degree of detail to the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment:

'''Phase II Environmental Site Assessment''' is an "intrusive" investigation which collects original samples of soil, groundwater or building materials to analyze for quantitative values of various contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Environmental Aspects of Real Estate and Commercial Transactions: From Brownfields to Green Buildings]]'', [[American Bar Association]], ed. by James B. Witkin (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  This investigation is normally undertaken when a Phase I ESA determines a likelihood of site contamination.  The most frequent substances tested are [[petroleum]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[heavy metals]], [[pesticide]]s, [[solvent]]s, asbestos and mold.

'''Phase III Environmental Site Assessment''' is an investigation involving remediation of a site. Phase III investigations aim to delineate the physical extent of contamination based on recommendations made in Phase II assessments. Phase III investigations may involve intensive testing, sampling, and monitoring, "fate and transport" studies and other modeling, and the design of feasibility studies for remediation and remedial plans. This study normally involves assessment of alternative cleanup methods, costs and logistics. The associated reportage details the steps taken to perform site cleanup and the follow-up monitoring for residual contaminants.

'''Limited Phase I Environmental Site Assessment''' is a truncated Phase I ESA, normally omitting one or more work segments such as the site visit or certain of the file searches. When the field visit component is deleted the study is sometimes called a '''Transaction Screen'''.

'''Environmental Assessment''' has little to do with the subject of hazardous substance liability, but rather is a study preliminary to an [[Environmental Impact Statement]], which identifies environmental impacts of a land development action and analyzes a broad set of parameters including [[biodiversity]], [[environmental noise]], [[water pollution]], [[air pollution]], [[traffic]], [[geotechnical]] risks, visual impacts, public safety issues and also hazardous substance issues.

'''SBA Phase I Environmental Site Assessment''' means {{visible anchor|all}} properties purchased through the United States [[Small Business Administration]]'s 504 Fixed Asset Financing Program require specific and often higher [[due diligence]] requirements than regular [[Real Estate]] transactions. Due diligence requirements are determined according to the [[NAICS]] codes associated with the prior business use of the property.  There are 58 specific NAICS codes that require Phase I Investigations.  These include, but are not limited to: Funeral Homes, Dry Cleaners, and [[Gas Station]]s. The SBA also requires Phase II Environmental Site Assessment to be performed on any Gas Station that has been in operation for more than 5 years. The additional cost to perform this assessment cannot be included in the amount requested in the loan and adds significant costs to the borrower.

'''Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae Phase I Environmental Site Assessments'''[https://www.partneresi.com/resources/publications/going-through-a-phase-fannie-mae-freddie-mac-environmental-guidelines] are two specialized types of Phase I ESAs that are required when a loan is financed through Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae.  The scopes of work are based on the ASTM E1527-05 Standard but have specific requirements including the following: the percent and scope of the property inspection; requirements for radon testing; asbestos and lead-based paint testing and operations-and-maintenance (O&amp;M) plans to manage the hazards in place; lead in drinking water; and mold inspection.  For condominiums, Fannie Mae requires a Phase I ESA anytime the initial underwriting analysis indicates environmental concerns.&lt;ref name="strategicinspections.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strategicinspections.com/services/phase-i-environmental-site-assessments-esas/|title= Phase I Environmental Site Assessments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HUD Phase I Environmental Site Assessment'''
The [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] also requires a Phase I ESA for any condominium under construction that wishes to offer an [[FHA insured loan]] to potential buyers.&lt;ref name="strategicinspections.com"/&gt;

'''Phonographic Performance Limited''', commonly known as '''PPL''', is a UK-based [[music licensing]] company and [[performance rights organisation]] founded by [[Decca Records|Decca]] and [[EMI]] in 1934. As of 2012 PPL collected royalties for 65,000 performers and 10,000 record companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PPL Annual Review 2012|page=3|url=http://ppluk.com/Documents/PPL%20AGM/2013/PPL_AR2012_online%20Annual%20Review.pdf|format=PDF|website=Ppluk.com|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its field of operation is distinct from the Performing Right Society, now called [[PRS for Music]], founded in 1914, which originally collected fees for live performance of sheet music.&lt;ref&gt;Globalization of Services: Some Implications for Theory and Practice - Page 174 Yair Aharoni, Lilach Nachum - 2000 "In 1997, a 'Music Alliance' joint venture was formed with the older performing right society PRS (founded in 1914) giving publishers a de facto overall control over both performance and mechanical rights collection (and distribution) in the UK."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popular music and society - Page 39 Brian Longhurst - 2007 "The three types of right identified in figure 1.5 are sometimes further grouped into performing and mechanical. The Performing Right Society (PRS), which was founded in 1914, is the principal collecting agency for performing Right Basis for "&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
PPL was formed in May 1934 by the record companies [[EMI]] and Decca Records, following a ground-breaking court case against a coffee shop in Bristol.

The coffee shop, Stephen Carwardine &amp; Co, had been entertaining its customers by playing records. EMI, then called The Gramophone Company, argued it was against the law to play the record in public without first receiving the permission of the copyright owners. The judge agreed, establishing this as a legal principle. EMI and Decca formed Phonographic Performance Ltd (PPL) to carry out this licensing role and opened the first office in London.

The Copyright Act 1956 led to the expansion of PPL's role to also cover the licensing of broadcasters that played recorded music. Further copyright law changes in 1988 strengthened PPL's licensing position.

In 1996, performers were given the rights to receive 'equitable remuneration' where recordings of their performances were played in public or broadcast  – leading to PPL paying them royalties directly for the first time. Performer organisations PAMRA and AURA merged with PPL in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company history|url=http://www.ppluk.com/About-Us/Who-We-Are/Company-history/|publisher=PPL|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to an annual meeting and dedicated board specifically for performers.

==VPL==
VPL, created in 1984, is PPL's sister company and specifically deals with the licensing of music videos when they are played in public or broadcast on TV. VPL distributes the fees as royalties to its rights holder members. Although technically a separate company, VPL operates under the same management as PPL. All activities relating to music videos are conducted as VPL business.

==Playing music in public==
;Music licensing for business

Any business that plays recorded music within PPL’s repertoire in public, such as a shop, bar, office, restaurant, gym, community building, not-for-profit organisation, or activities such as dance classes will need to have a PPL licence. One exception being a hotel, guest house or B&amp;B that has fewer than 25 rooms and does not have any areas that are open to non-residents (such as a bar or restaurant).

A PPL licence is required when recorded music, within PPL’s repertoire,  including radio and TV, is played in public. There is no statutory definition of 'playing in public' (also sometimes referred to as 'public performance') but the UK courts have given guidance on its meaning and ruled that it is any playing of music outside of a domestic setting. So, for example, playing recorded music at a workplace, public event or in the course of any business activities is considered to be 'playing in public. No licence is required for listening on headphones. 
In contrast, any recorded music being played as part of domestic home life or when there is an audience entirely of friends and/or family (such as at a private family party) does not require a PPL licence.

A PPL licence gives the licence holder the permission to play recorded music from PPL's repertoire (the vast majority of commercially released music in the UK). Playing music that is outside of its [[copyright term]] or [[Free license|freely licensed]] does not require a PPL licence.

;Music licensing for radio broadcasting

PPL licenses [[radio stations]] based in the UK, Isle of Man and Channel Islands to use recorded music within its repertoire in all forms of radio, from traditional FM/AM broadcasting to satellite and online radio streaming.

;Music licensing for television broadcasting

With the relevant PPL music licence, broadcasters can use recorded music within PPL’s repertoire and/or music videos in their programming with the permission of the performer and copyright owner.

Applications for music licences can be made online at ppluk.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PPL website|url=http://www.ppluk.com/|publisher=PPL|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
After administration costs, and certain contributions to anti-piracy activities and music industry charities (all of which are agreed by the membership at the Annual General Meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PPL Company Annual Review 2011|url=http://issuu.com/ppl_uk/docs/ppl_ar2011|publisher=PPL|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;),  all revenue generated from PPL licence fees is passed onto its registered members as royalties for the use of their recorded music. PPL members range from session musicians and emerging artists to major [[record labels]] and globally successful performers. It is free to join PPL as a member.

;Record companies

Anyone who owns, or holds an exclusive licence to, the rights for when recorded music is broadcast or played in public in the UK can join PPL as a recording rights holder member. This can include major record labels, independent labels, self-releasing artists or companies that have simply purchased the relevant rights.

;Performers

Anyone who has performed on recorded music can join PPL as a performer member. If an audible contribution has been made to a recorded music track, the performer could be eligible for royalties. This means anybody, from lead singers to choir members rock drummers to classical musicians, who has contributed to a recording could be eligible for PPL royalties. In addition, certain inaudible contributions (such as a conductor) are also eligible.

==Repertoire==
A licence is required from PPL whenever recorded music within its repertoire is played in public or broadcast. PPL’s repertoire includes all recorded music owned or controlled by its direct members or by members of any of the overseas collective management organisations with which PPL has a reciprocal agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PPL website|url=http://www.ppluk.com/Documents/Member%20Services/PPL%20International%20Reciprocal%20Deals.pdf|publisher=PPL|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPL’s repertoire covers the vast majority of recorded music commercially available in the UK.

==The difference between PPL and PRS for Music==
PPL and [[PRS for Music]] are two separate independent companies and in most instances a licence is required from both organisations to play recorded music legally in public. While both companies licence the use of music and collect royalties for the music industry, they represent different rights holders and have separate licences, terms, and conditions.

PPL collects and distributes money for the use of recorded music on behalf of record companies and performers. PRS for Music collects and distributes money for the use of the musical composition and lyrics on behalf of authors, songwriters, composers, and publishers.

===PPL PRS Ltd===
In 2018, PPL and PRS for Music formed a jointly owned subsidiary, PPL PRS Ltd, to collect all licence fees for public performances. PPL PRS Ltd is based in Leicester, England,

==International services==
PPL offers an additional optional service to both record company and performer members to collect revenue due to the members from collective management organisations in numerous countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2378">A '''plurilateral agreement''' is a multi-national legal or trade agreement between countries. In economic jargon, it is an agreement between more than two countries, but not a great many, which would be [[multilateral agreement]].&lt;ref name="DGIEP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Deardorff's Glossary of International Economics: P |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/p.html |accessdate=2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the term in the World Trade Organization==
The term "plurilateral agreement" is used in the [[World Trade Organization]]. A plurilateral agreement implies that [[WTO_accession_and_membership |WTO member countries]] would be given the choice to agree to new rules on a voluntary basis. This contrasts with the multilateral WTO agreement, where all [[WTO_accession_and_membership |WTO members]] are party to the agreement. The [[Agreement on Government Procurement]] is typical plurilateral agreement.

==Plurilateral treaties==
A plurilateral treaty is a special type of [[multilateral treaty]]. A plurilateral treaty is a treaty between a limited number of states with a particular interest in the subject of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Aust (2000). ''Modern Treaty Law and Practice'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary difference between a plurilateral treaty and other multilateral treaties is that the availability of [[reservation (law)|reservations]] is more limited under a plurilateral treaty. Due to the limited nature of a plurilateral treaty, the full cooperation of the parties to the treaty is required in order for the object of the treaty to be met. As a result, reservations to plurilateral treaties are not allowed without the consent of all other parties to the treaty. This principle is codified in [[international law]] by article 20(2) of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When it appears from the limited number of the negotiating states and the object and purpose of a treaty that the application of the treaty in its entirety between all the parties is an essential condition of the consent of each one to be bound by the treaty, a reservation requires acceptance by all the parties.&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, (1969) 1155 U.N.T.S. 331 (in force 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Pochvennichestvo''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|tʃ|v|ɛ|n|ɪ|tʃ|ɛ|s|t|v|oʊ}}; {{lang-rus|Почвенничество|p=ˈpot͡ɕvʲɪnnʲɪt͡ɕɪstvə}}, roughly "return to the soil", from [[wikt:почва#Russian|почва]] "soil") was a late 19th-century [[Russia]]n movement tied in closely with its contemporary ideology, the [[Slavophile]] movement. 

==History==
Both the Slavophiles and the ''pochvennichestvo'' movement were for the complete [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|emancipation]] of [[serfdom]], stressed a strong desire to return to the idealized past of Russia's history and opposed [[Europeanization]]. The movement also chose a complete rejection of the [[nihilist movement|nihilist]], [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] movements of the time. Their primary focus was to change Russian [[society]] by the humbling of the self and social reform through the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] rather than the radical implementations of the [[intelligentsia]]. 

The major differences between the Slavophiles and the movement were that the former detested the Westernization policies of [[Peter the Great]], but the latter praised what were seen as the benefits of the notorious ruler but maintained a strong [[patriotic]] mentality for the [[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality]]. Another major difference was that many of the movement's leaders and supporters adopted a militantly [[anti-Protestantism|anti-Protestant]], [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] and [[anti-Semitic]] stance.

The concept had its roots in the works of the [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who focused primarily on emphasizing the differences among people and regional cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XfDOcmJisn0C&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=Pochvennichestvo+herder&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Pochvennichestvo%20herder&amp;f=false The Dostoevsky Encyclopaedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lbMYxaFTMZAC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=Pochvennichestvo+herder&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Pochvennichestvo%20herder&amp;f=false Dostoevsky the Thinker]''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition it rejected the [[universalism (disambiguation)|universalism]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period. The most prominent{{Says who|date=October 2015}} Russian intellectuals who founded the ideology were [[Nikolay Strakhov]], [[Nikolay Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontyev]].

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] also held such views, as he expressed in his novel ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]''. The ideology was later adopted by [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].

'''Razor 1911''' ('''RZR''') is a [[warez]] and [[demogroup]] founded in Norway, 1985. According to the US Justice Department, Razor 1911 is the oldest software cracking group that is still active on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130415114316/http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/press-releases/2003/pitmanSent.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Voyage.png|thumb|270px| Voyage, a Classic Razor 1911 [[Amiga]] Demo from 1991]]

The group was founded as ''Razor 2992'' by Doctor No, Insane TTM and Sector9 in [[Norway]] in October 1985 as a [[Commodore 64]] [[copyright infringement of software|software cracking]] group. Shortly after, they changed from 2992 to 1911 which translates to [[777 (number)#Computing|777]] in
[[hexadecimal]].

Between 1987 and 1988 the group began to move away from the Commodore 64 and migrated to a new hardware platform, coding demos and cracking games for the [[Amiga]]. In the very early 1990s Razor 1911 made another transition, this time to the [[IBM PC]], foremost as a cracking group, but still continuing to release [[crack intro|cracktro loaders]], demos and music.

Razor was a supply group on [[floppy disk|diskette]] from 1992 until diskettes were abandoned for [[CD-ROM]]s. Throughout the 1990s Razor faced competition from many different groups, ranging from groups such as [[Tristar and Red Sector Incorporated|Tristar &amp; Red Sector inc.]] (TRSi), [[International Network of Crackers]] (INC), [[The Dream Team (warez)|The Dream Team]] (TDT) and [[Fairlight (group)|Fairlight]] (FLT) in 1994 to Prestige, [[Hybrid (warez)|Hybrid]] (HBD), and others in 1995. Razor was revitalised by new members gained from another group, Nexus, who brought with them some UK suppliers and the leaders The Speed Racer (TSR), Hot Tuna and The Gecko. Razor had a handful of others throughout the 1990s, such as Zodact, The Renegade Chemist (TRC), The WiTcH KiNG, Butcher, SwiTch, Marauder, and Randall Flagg.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RAZOR TRN.png|right|thumb|200px|A Razor 1911 [[Trainer (games)|trainer]] (October 1999)|{{puic|1=RAZOR TRN.png|log=2009 February 14}}]] --&gt;
In 1995 diskette releases were rapidly being supplanted by CD-ROMs, and Razor 1911 moved into the CD-ripping scene. The crew that led Razor into this new chapter included members such as TSR, Pharaoh, Fatal Error, GRIZZLY, Suspicious Image, Third Son, Hot Tuna, Beowulf, Pitbull, Bunter, Manhunter, Niteman, Vitas, Mausioso and The Punisher.

Razor once again took on a new challenge when the [[ISO 9660|ISO]] scene was formed. Razor 1911 began to release ISOs when they became the standard of the day, led most significantly by The Punisher. He was instrumental in Razor's recovery and its solid performance in the ISO scene. Following The Punisher's retirement, Razor was led by various different people and underwent some internal problems in the form of leadership challenges. This was solved when Pitbull, an old Razor member from the 1990s, took over the leadership role. The FBI claimed him to still be the leader of Razor at the time when "[[Operation Buccaneer]]", an international anti-piracy operation which led to raids at the homes of over 60 piracy suspects worldwide in 2001, was carried out even though NFOs and scene activity at the time points out The Renegade Chemist as actual leader of the group.

On June 22, 2006, Razor 1911 started releasing games again. They have been releasing games fairly consistently ever since, and as of 2010 are among the most prolific groups at cracking new releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=1708 |work=SceneNotice.org |title=The Game Scene Charts Issue 38 December 2009 Edition |date=2010-01-20}} Razor 1911 is on position 10 for the year 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2011, Razor 1911's demo division won the public choice award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://awards.scene.org/awards.php?year=2010&amp;cat=11 |title=Scene.org Awards |date=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [http://awards.scene.org Scene.org Awards] ceremony at [[The Gathering (computer party)|The Gathering]] for their [[64k intro]] "Insert No Coins" coded by Rez with music from [[Dubmood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=55991 | title=pouet.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="58092">The '''security policy of the [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] administration''' prioritizes the reduction of violence rather than attacking Mexico's drug trafficking organizations head-on, marking a departure from the strategy of the past six years during [[Felipe Calderón|Felipe Calderón's administration]].&lt;ref name=how&gt;{{cite news|last=Corcoran|first=Patrick|title=What Mexico's Elections Mean for Crime Policy: Part I|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2811-what-mexicos-elections-mean-for-crime-policy-part-i|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=[[InSight Crime]]|date=25 June 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hOifSrP?url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2811-what-mexicos-elections-mean-for-crime-policy-part-i|archivedate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto has set up a number of conceptual and organizational changes from the past regime policy, and one of the biggest contrasts is the focus on lowering murder rates, kidnappings, and extortions, as opposed to arresting or killing the country's [[List of Mexico's 37 most-wanted drug lords|most-wanted drug lords]] and intercepting their drug shipments.&lt;ref name=how/&gt; The government of Calderón, however, has justified its position by stating that the current violence in the country is a necessary stage in [[Mexican Drug War|Mexico's drug war]], as weakening criminal groups fight for territorial control against one another and the government. Moreover, part of Peña Nieto's strategy also consists on the creation of a national police made up of 40,000 members, known as a "[[gendarmerie]]." He also proposed on centralizing the sub-federal police forces under one command.&lt;ref name=how/&gt; The president-elect emphasized that he does not support the involvement or presence of armed U.S. agents in Mexico, but considers allowing the United States to instruct Mexico's military training in [[counterinsurgency]] tactics.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt; Beyond that, Peña Nieto promised that no other measures will be taken by the U.S. in Mexico.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico's Pena Nieto Will Use US Help in Drug War|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/2012/07/06/mexico-pena-nieto-will-use-us-help-in-drug-war/|accessdate=8 July 2012|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=6 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hPukrqJ?url=http://latino.foxnews.com/2012/07/06/mexico-pena-nieto-will-use-us-help-in-drug-war/|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While campaigning, Peña Nieto appointed a former general of the [[National Police of Colombia]] as his external advisor for public security, and boldly promised to reduce 50% of the murder rates in Mexico by the end of his six-year term.&lt;ref name=unclear/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hernandez|first=Daniel|title=Mexico candidate Peña Nieto seeks Colombia drug fighter as advisor|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/06/mexico-enrique-pena-nieto-oscar-naranjo-colombia.html|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=19 June 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hQGcXsi?url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/06/mexico-enrique-pena-nieto-oscar-naranjo-colombia.html|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Peña Nieto's security strategy, however, say that he has offered "little sense" in exactly ''how'' he will reduce the violence.&lt;ref name=how/&gt;&lt;ref name=unclear/&gt; During the three-month campaign, Peña Nieto was not explicit on his anti-crime strategy, and many analysts wonder whether Peña Nieto is holding back politically sensitive details in his security strategy or simply does not know yet how he will squelch the violence and carry out the next stage in Mexico's drug war.&lt;ref name=unclear&gt;{{cite news|last=Gomez Licon|first=Adriana|title=New Mexican president could target small gangs|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/07/05/new-mexican-president-could-target-small-gangs/|accessdate=5 August 2012|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=5 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hQ7UT3k?url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/07/05/new-mexican-president-could-target-small-gangs/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+foxnews/world+(Internal+-+World+Latest+-+Text)|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, U.S. officials are worried that the return of Peña Nieto's [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) after ruling Mexico for 71 years  may mean returning to the old PRI tactics of  "corruption [and] backroom deals" with the cartels in exchange for bribes and relative peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanchez|first=Raf|title=Mexican election raises fears in Washington|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/mexico/9365421/Mexican-election-raises-fears-in-Washington.html|accessdate=3 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=29 June 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hQQqqBz?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/mexico/9365421/Mexican-election-raises-fears-in-Washington.html|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanchez|first=Raf|title=Presidential favourite worries U.S officials as Mexicans head to polls|url=https://vancouversun.com/news/Presidential+favourite+worries+officials+Mexicans+head+polls/6866616/story.html|accessdate=8 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|date=30 June 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hQYVQKF?url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Presidential+favourite+worries+officials+Mexicans+head+polls/6866616/story.html|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto denies that he will negotiate with the cartels.&lt;ref name=usconcern/&gt;

===Kingpin strategy===
Throughout the administration of [[Felipe Calderón]], the Mexican government argued that the arrests of the top leaders in the drug trafficking organizations did not lead to violence.&lt;ref name=kingpin&gt;{{cite news|last=Pachico|first=Elyssa|title=Mexico Defense of Kingpin Strategy Falls Short |url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/1092-mexico-defense-of-kingpin-strategy-falls-short |accessdate=7 July 2012 |newspaper=[[InSight Crime]] |date=16 June 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hQosIsL?url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/1092-mexico-defense-of-kingpin-strategy-falls-short |archivedate=5 August 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a new public campaign, the government released 10 videos that explained the "myths" behind Mexico's drug war, one of them including the so-called "kingpin strategy," which focuses on taking down the drug lords and leaders of the [[drug cartels]]. The government's counterargument against critiques was that killing or arresting drug kingpins had no effect on the already rising murder rates in an area.&lt;ref name=kingpin/&gt; In some cases, however, the government argued that violence went down after a drug kingpin was taken out.&lt;ref name=kingpin/&gt; The most common critique against the kingpin strategy is that arresting or killing leaders in criminal organizations leaves a leadership void, fracturing the cartels and allowing rival groups to take over the assets of the cartel. The theory is used to explain why violence has spiked in the states of [[Tamaulipas]] and [[Nuevo León]], where the arrest of the Gulf cartel's leader – [[Osiel Cárdenas Guillén]] – led to the split of the two groups that composed the organization: the [[Gulf Cartel]] and [[Los Zetas]].&lt;ref name=kingpin/&gt; Back in 2010, the state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] lived a similar phenomenon with the rupture of the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] and the Beltrán Leyva cartel after the military gunned down [[Arturo Beltrán Leyva]], a top leader in the Beltrán Leyva cartel. Calderón has a different interpretation of the situation, however. He argues that taking down the kingpins does not increase the violence in states that are already among the most dangerous in Mexico. By this theory, the army was sent in to restore order in states already plagued with violence; hence, their presence is a product, not a cause, of the rising murder rates.&lt;ref name=kingpin/&gt;

Peña Nieto, however, said in a news conference that he can ease the waves of violence in [[Mexican Drug War]] by redirecting the focus of the military approach carried out by Mexico's current president, [[Felipe Calderón]].&lt;ref name=epnseguridad&gt;{{cite news|last=Weissenstain|first=Michael|title=Mexico pres front-runner promises to cut violence|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Mexico-pres-front-runner-promises-to-cut-violence-3585942.php|accessdate=27 May 2012|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=25 May 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hR3C11v?url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Mexico-pres-front-runner-promises-to-cut-violence-3585942.php|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of focusing primarily on taking down the heads of the criminal organizations and the [[List of Mexico's 37 most-wanted drug lords|most-wanted drug lords]] of the cartels, he proposes to use government resources to put down homicides, kidnappings, and extortions—crimes that do the most damage to the Mexican people—by flooding troops and police into places with the highest rates of violence crimes.&lt;ref name=epnseguridad/&gt; Peña Nieto, however, said that his proposal does not mean that the government will not tackle other crimes nor prevent drug trafficking, but rather noted that arresting drug bosses will no longer be the focus of his administration.&lt;ref name=epnseguridad/&gt; Opponents of Peña Nieto have said that the PRI's return will mean the going back to the "old PRI model" of making deals with the cartels.&lt;ref name=epnseguridad/&gt; Nonetheless, the presidential candidate has praised Calderón's decision of sending in troops to fight the cartels, and has emphasized plans to increase the military presence in areas most effected by drug-related violence, like [[Monterrey]] and [[Veracruz]].&lt;ref name=epnseguridad/&gt; The security policy of Peña Nieto does not say that it will stop fighting the drug cartels; it proposes that it will simply shift away from targeting the heads of the cartels.&lt;ref name=npsecurity&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico presidential front-runner vows to put an end to gruesome violence|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/05/25/mexico-presidential-front-runner-vows-to-put-an-end-to-gruesome-violence/|accessdate=27 May 2012|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=25 May 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hRENXfa?url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/05/25/mexico-presidential-front-runner-vows-to-put-an-end-to-gruesome-violence/|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This redirection is a response to the criticism made by critics to Calderón for targeting a few main cartels and splitting them up into smaller and more violent factions.&lt;ref name=npsecurity/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Corcoran|first=Patrick|title=Street Gangs to Replace Cartels as Drivers of Mexico's Violence|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2097-street-gangs-to-replace-cartels-as-drivers-of-mexicos-violence|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=[[InSight Crime]]|date=18 January 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hRMzwnh?url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2097-street-gangs-to-replace-cartels-as-drivers-of-mexicos-violence|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto's strategy would align with a new strain of thinking for the general public, which calls for law enforcement in both the [[United States]] and Mexico to make the reduction of violence, kidnappings, and extortion their overwhelming focus in the War on Drugs.&lt;ref name=npsecurity/&gt; According to [[Reuters]], other experts argue that Mexico's criminal groups do not have to be provoked and often ambush Mexico's security forces when they are on patrol, and that the cartels have become so violent that the Mexican government will have no other option but to keep battling them – whether they want to or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Ioan Grillo]]|title=Drug war fury awaits Mexico's Pena Nieto|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/05/us-mexico-election-drugs-idUSBRE86418320120705|accessdate=8 July 2012|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=5 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hRSrerW?url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/05/us-mexico-election-drugs-idUSBRE86418320120705|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Eric Olson, a U.S.-Mexico security co-operation scholar from the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]], advocates a similar strategy for the reduction of violence. Olson acknowledged that the government should slow down its attacks against cartels that are less violent than others, and focus on Mexico's "biggest problem, the violence that is terrorizing the population and undermining the legitimacy of the state."&lt;ref name=npsecurity/&gt; Olson said that crime will always exist, but one can make it less harmful by getting it out of people's lives as much as possible. He concluded by saying that this proposal is not a "de facto negotiation" with the cartels—but rather a question of what comes first.&lt;ref name=npsecurity/&gt; Some U.S. officials, however, are concerned that Peña Nieto's strategy will mean the return to the old and corrupt practices of the PRI regime, where the government made deals and turned a blind eye on the cartels in exchange for peace.&lt;ref name=usconcern/&gt; After all, they worry that [[Mexican Drug War|Mexico's drug war]], which has cost over 50,000 lives, will make Mexicans question on why they should "pay the price for a US drug habit."&lt;ref name=usconcern/&gt; Peña Nieto denies, however, that his party will tolerate corruption and stated he will not make deals with the cartels.&lt;ref name=usconcern&gt;{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Rory|title=US concerned Mexico's new president may go easy on drug cartels|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/02/usa-mexico-president-drugs-cartels|accessdate=3 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hQgNmWc?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/02/usa-mexico-president-drugs-cartels|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 2012, the day of the election, the president-elect said the following:

===Gendarmerie===
Peña Nieto has repeated throughout his campaign that he will build a new 40,000-member paramilitary police that will be dispatched to the areas plagued by drug-violence.&lt;ref name=graham1/&gt; The creation of the "national [[gendarmerie]]" is planned to be bigger than the size of the [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Federal police]], with added patrols, greater intelligence, and made up by soldiers already deployed during the ''sexenio'' of [[Felipe Calderón]]. His aim in the creation of this new police, besides reducing the violence, is supporting the municipalities with major institutional weakness, since he said that some municipalities in Mexico lack a police force.&lt;ref name=graham1&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham|first=Dave|title=Mexico's Pena Nieto plans new police to fight drug gangs|url=http://us.mobile.reuters.com/article/Deals/idUSBRE8380VG20120409?irpc=932|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=9 April 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hRjYCVI?url=http://us.mobile.reuters.com/article/Deals/idUSBRE8380VG20120409?irpc=932|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the new gendarmerie is largely going to be reflected on its funding level; for years, Mexico has reorganized, renamed, and created new security organizations because the past agencies have proven to be inefficient and corrupt.&lt;ref name=jonesgen&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Nathan|title=Mexico, drugs and a possible way forward|url=http://blog.chron.com/bakerblog/2012/07/mexico-drugs-and-a-way-forward/|accessdate=28 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Houston Chronicle]]|date=28 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hRpDXb9?url=http://blog.chron.com/bakerblog/2012/07/mexico-drugs-and-a-way-forward/|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding capacity of the government will therefore be crucial for the success of the gendarmerie, because if it is poorly funded it will most likely be infiltrated by the drug trafficking organizations and be doomed to failure.&lt;ref name=jonesgen/&gt;

The new gendarmerie will be deployed mostly to rural areas, but security experts have mentioned that moving security resources out of the urban areas may be troubling for cities.&lt;ref name=smallergangs&gt;{{cite news|last=Weissentein|first=Michael|title=New Mexican president could target small gangs|url=https://news.yahoo.com/mexican-president-could-target-small-gangs-072604206.html|accessdate=5 August 2012|newspaper=[[Yahoo!

Peña Nieto's new gendarmerie, however, will be composed of ranks from the Mexican military, raising doubts on whether or not his proposal will simply be a repackaging of Calderón's military-led strategy.&lt;ref name=smallergangs/&gt; In addition, Alejandro Hope, a security expert and former member of the [[CISEN]], Mexico's intelligence agency, wrote on May 2012 about the unanswered questions regarding the creation of the new gendarmerie.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite news|last=Hope|first=Alejandro|title=Peña responde a los preguntones|url=http://www.animalpolitico.com/blogueros-plata-o-plomo/2012/05/23/pena-responde-a-los-preguntones/|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=Animal Político|date=23 May 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hS8G3QP?url=http://www.animalpolitico.com/blogueros-plata-o-plomo/2012/05/23/pena-responde-a-los-preguntones/|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, he wrote that the creation of Peña Nieto's new police force will not be much different from keeping the current troops under a military command. As Hope points out, "unless the [new gendarmerie] is magic," the scenario will be the same people performing the same duties and with the same equipment.&lt;ref name=hopeinsight/&gt; In a second scenario, Hope wrote how the military will actively support the gendarmerie in problem areas. Consequently, he pointed out that this scenario will eliminate the only advantage of having a gendarmerie: lacking any involvement or command from a military unit.&lt;ref name=hopeinsight/&gt; The final critique of Hope was the idea that the new gendarmerie will be made up of ex-military members. He points out that the two largest pools to get these kind of people would be from retired or [[deserters]] of the Armed Forces, neither which Hope considers desirable members in a gendarmerie. According to [[InSight Crime]], the gendarmerie proposal issued by Peña Nieto gives critics an opening to suggest that he is "playing to the frustrations of the Mexican people" and suggesting police reforms simply for the sake of changing Calderón's strategy, even if it does not improve the security measures throughout Mexico.&lt;ref name=hopeinsight&gt;{{cite news|last=Kane|first=Michael|title=Peña Nieto Discusses Proposed Security Force|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2849-pe%C3%B1a-nieto-discusses-proposed-security-force|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=[[InSight Crime]]|date=3 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hSFDEQt?url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2849-peña-nieto-discusses-proposed-security-force|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The force's impact would also depend on ''how'' it is used. If Peña Nieto decides to shift the gendarmerie from hotspot to hotspot and not allow the force to pave its continuity in a given area, it may have little impact in putting down the violence. Nonetheless, if Peña Nieto decides to focus the gendarmerie to target certain cells within the cartels that are involved [[extortions]] and [[kidnappings]], it may be successful.&lt;ref name=jonesgen/&gt;

According to a 2013 report published by the [[Washington Office on Latin America]] looking at the first year of Peña Nieto's administration, the gendarmerie, originally advertised as a 40,000-member paramilitary police force, will be reduced to 5,000 civilian members within the Federal Police, and will not be operational until July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Maureen and Clay Boggs. {{cite news|title=One Year into Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto's Administration|url=http://www.wola.org/commentary/one_year_into_the_enrique_pena_nieto_administration|accessdate=20 February 2014|newspaper=[[Washington Office on Latin America]]|date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Colombian advisor====
Peña Nieto promised that if he was voted in, he would appoint Óscar Naranjo as his security advisor, a prominent Colombian police general. Naranjo is highly qualified for the job, having already lived the transformation of a discredited police force in [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name=dudleycs&gt;{{cite news|last=Dudley|first=Steven|title=Can Colombian expert reform Mexico's troubled police force?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/Latin-America-Monitor/2012/0713/Can-Colombian-expert-reform-Mexico-s-troubled-police-force|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=13 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hSJixBt?url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/Latin-America-Monitor/2012/0713/Can-Colombian-expert-reform-Mexico-s-troubled-police-force|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, when Naranjo was a young officer, Colombia's police force had very similar problem to the one in Mexico: almost all the police was under the payroll and service of the drug lords.&lt;ref name=dudleycs/&gt; Today, the [[National Police of Colombia]] is a model of reform in Latin America and often train police forces around the hemisphere.&lt;ref name=dudleycs/&gt; As head of the police force, Naranjo's "single greatest achievement" was Colombia's creation of the most effective and sophisticated intelligence agency in the region.&lt;ref name=dudleycs/&gt; According to [[InSight Crime]], Naranjo has worked closely with several corrupt officials, and accused on more than one occasion of being corrupt himself.&lt;ref name=dudleyinsight&gt;{{cite news|last=Dudley|first=Steven|title=Why Mexico Police Reform Could Defeat Even Colombia's Ex-Top Cop|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2868-why-mexican-police-reform-could-defeat-even-colombias-ex-top-cop|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=[[InSight Crime]]|date=9 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hSR0n9o?url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2868-why-mexican-police-reform-could-defeat-even-colombias-ex-top-cop|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; But although rarely acknowledged, working on a regular basis with officials one cannot trust and gently discharging them with minimal harm like Naranjo did is essential to reform efforts.&lt;ref name=dudleyinsight/&gt; ''[[CS Monitor]]'' alleges that Naranjo knew how to marginalize corrupt officials and maximize the use of his honest personnel.&lt;ref name=dudleycs/&gt; Nonetheless, Naranjo will be working in [[Mexico]], a country with twice the population of Colombia, and with many of the police forces working at a municipal and state level and out of the federal control.&lt;ref name=dudleyinsight/&gt; The bureaucratic and political challenges that Naranjo will face in Mexico may stifle his attempts to reform the country's police force.&lt;ref name=dudleyinsight/&gt; Naranjo will also be handling a different organizational structure, which may perpetuate "political battles" between the [[Ministry of Public Security (Mexico City)|SPP]], the [[Secretariat of National Defense]], and the [[Attorney General of Mexico]] over who keeps certain resources, information, and prestige.&lt;ref name=dudleyinsight/&gt;

Peña Nieto promises that Naranjo's incorporation will bring Mexico into a robust focus on the financial networks of the cartels, just like the strategy that was implemented in [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite news|title=Peña incorpora a general colombiano como asesor en seguridad|url=http://www.adnpolitico.com/2012/2012/06/14/pena-incorpora-a-general-colombiano-como-asesor-en-seguridad|accessdate=21 June 2012|newspaper=Animal Político|date=14 June 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hSWo1oI?url=http://www.adnpolitico.com/2012/2012/06/14/pena-incorpora-a-general-colombiano-como-asesor-en-seguridad|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it is still unclear whether attacking the financial sectors of the drug cartels will bring down the violence.&lt;ref name=launderisc&gt;{{cite news|last=Corcoran|first=Patrick|title=Horse Racing Arrests Kick Off Bad Week for the Zetas|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2780-horse-racing-arrests-kick-off-bad-week-for-the-zetas|accessdate=21 June 2012|newspaper=[[InSight Crime]]|date=18 June 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hSc3Alz?url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2780-horse-racing-arrests-kick-off-bad-week-for-the-zetas|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', Naranjo said that the new gendarmerie will not just target major drug traffickers, but mid-level and lower-level cartel hitmen as a way of reducing the violence.&lt;ref name=bajak&gt;{{cite news|last=Bajak|first=Frank|title=Mexico Elite Counterdrug Units May Be New Strategy To Target Drug Traffickers|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/07/mexico-elite-counterdrug-units_n_1656021.html|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=6 June 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hShwgM6?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/07/mexico-elite-counterdrug-units_n_1656021.html?utm_hp_ref=world|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned that Peña Nieto might fulfill his promise of bringing down the number of murders and kidnappings by 50% during his six years as president. The tactic used by Naranjo in Colombia has generated questions whether that strategy could produce similar results in a different country.&lt;ref name=bajak/&gt; In addition, according to InSight Crime, it is highly unlikely that Peña Nieto will bring such a drop in the murder rate with his security policies alone. However, there are tentative signs as of 2012 that the violence in Mexico is already peaking and that the cartels are opting for policies of more cautiousness and lower visibility, which could mean that it could begin to decline significantly during Peña Nieto's administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hope|first=Alejandro|title=What March's Murder Rate Says About Trends in Mexico Violence|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2538-what-marchs-murder-rate-says-about-trends-in-mexico-violence|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=[[InSight Crime]]|date=25 April 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hSnDywK?url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2538-what-marchs-murder-rate-says-about-trends-in-mexico-violence|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug legalization debates===
During an interview with ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'' as president-elect, Peña Nieto said that Mexico – along with Latin America and the United States – should have a debate about [[drug legalization]] and the regulation of drug sales in the country, an approach advocated by some Latin American leaders who want to reduce the revenues of the drug trafficking organizations by legalizing [[marijuana]].&lt;ref name=druglegal&gt;{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Margaret|title=Mexico's President-Elect: Legalization Should Be Part of Drug Strategy Debate|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/07/mexican-president-elect.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=[[PBS NewsHour]]|date=3 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hW4CGFE?url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/07/mexican-president-elect.html|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He insisted, however that he is not in favor of legalizing narcotics, but is in favor of opening a new debate to fight drug trafficking.&lt;ref name=druglegal/&gt; According to Peña Nieto, the [[War on Drugs]] has not provided positive results because it has not reduced [[Substance abuse|drug consumption]] nor drug trafficking, which means that the policy is "not moving in the right direction."&lt;ref name=druglegal/&gt; Peña Nieto also spoke with [[Fareed Zakaria]] in an airing interview through [[CNN]] where he called for a "new debate" on the drug war, saying the U.S. should play a major role in the discussion and stating:
{{Quotation|"Yes, I do believe we should open up a new debate regarding how to wage war on [[drug trafficking]]. Personally, I'm not in favor of legalizing [[drugs]]. I'm not persuaded by that as an argument. However, let's open up a new debate, a review, in which the [[United States|U.S.]] plays a fundamental role in conducting this review ... What we seek now in our new strategy is to adjust what's been done up until now. It is not a radical change. It is to broaden the coverage and above all, the emphasis I aspire to of reducing the violence in [[Mexico]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Fareed Zakaria]]|title=Mexico's Peña Nieto calls for 'new debate' on the drug war|url=http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/08/mexicos-pena-nieto-calls-for-new-debate-on-the-drug-war/|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=8 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hWAgRgc?url=http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/08/mexicos-pena-nieto-calls-for-new-debate-on-the-drug-war/|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Enrique Peña Nieto]]}}

By arguing that the legalization debate should be discussed, Peña Nieto is echoing that Mexico is prepared to move in the direction that several leaders in [[Latin America]] have openly debated.&lt;ref name=busch&gt;{{cite news|last=Busch|first=Michael|title=Changing the Drugs Debate in Mexico|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-busch/home-about-teaching-is-me_b_1647987.html|accessdate=14 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=13 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hWHk8iJ?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-busch/home-about-teaching-is-me_b_1647987.html|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[6th Summit of the Americas]] on April 2012, for the first time, many leaders in the Latin American world debated at the summit – although behind closed doors – whether they should stop following the "U.S.-sponsored-and-dictated" [[War on Drugs]], partially legalize drugs, or regulate the drug trade.&lt;ref name=busch/&gt; According to ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', the debate reached President [[Barack Obama]], but coverage of the debate by the U.S. media was lessened because of competition from an embarrassing sex scandal involving the U.S. Secret Service and some prostitutes.&lt;ref name=busch/&gt; Nevertheless, the message from the Latin America leaders was clear: "[they] no longer accept the American line on drug policy."&lt;ref name=busch/&gt;

===United States partnership===
Peña Nieto wants to expand Mexico's drug war partnership with the [[United States]], but discarded the presence of armed U.S. agents in Mexico.&lt;ref name=tactics&gt;{{cite news|last=Booth|first=William|title=Mexico to keep fighting cartels|url=https://www.usatoday.com/USCP/PNI/Front%20Page/2012-07-06-PNI0706wir-Mexico_ST_U.htm|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=6 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hWNYYQC?url=http://www.usatoday.com/USCP/PNI/Front%20Page/2012-07-06-PNI0706wir-Mexico_ST_U.htm|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the president-elect supported hosting U.S military training on Mexican soil, but only for training purposes and to help the Mexican Armed Forces benefit from the U.S. [[counterinsurgency]] tactics learned in the [[Iraq War]] and in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=tactics/&gt; He also approved the continuation of flights by U.S. surveillance drones to gather information on drug trafficking, but stated that further missions would be handled by the Mexican authorities with assistance and technology from the United States. Moreover, the incorporation of the former Colombian police general Óscar Naranjo signals that Peña Nieto will be a solid partner with the U.S., since Naranjo is close to the U.S. military and law-enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name=tactics/&gt;

Unlike countries like [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Colombia]], where the U.S. combats drug trafficking side-by-side with local police and the military, Peña Nieto resisted similar joint operations by claiming that they would violate Mexico's sovereignty and its written [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution]].&lt;ref name=tactics/&gt;  There are no U.S. military bases in Mexico; and by law, American-law enforcement agents are not allowed to carry any weapons in Mexico, even for personal protection.&lt;ref name=tactics/&gt;

A report issued by the [[United States Senate]] on July 2012 concluded that the deployment of the military to fight against organized crime in Mexico has largely been "ineffective" and has increased the homicide rates in the country.&lt;ref name=copsnotarmy&gt;{{cite news|last=Booth|first=William|title=Senate report says Mexico must focus on cops, courts, not army|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/senate-report-says-mexico-must-focus-on-cops-and-courts-not-army/2012/07/11/gJQAufLudW_story.html|accessdate=14 July 2012|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=11 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hWSVP2w?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/senate-report-says-mexico-must-focus-on-cops-and-courts-not-army/2012/07/11/gJQAufLudW_story.html|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written to help guide [[United States Congress|Congress]] towards the new strategy of Peña Nieto, who suggested that his regime will focus on bringing down the violence rather than arresting and killing top drug barons and carrying out drug seizures heading to the world's largest drug consumer, the United States.&lt;ref name=copsnotarmy/&gt; Rather than giving away billions of dollars in equipment to Mexico, the report urges for a policy change towards teaching and training Mexico's police, who are outgunned and corrupted by the criminal groups.&lt;ref name=copsnotarmy/&gt; Overall, the report offers an assessment that may take years, perhaps even a whole generation, to materialize.&lt;ref name=copsnotarmy/&gt; In the report, a statement concluded the following:
{{Quotation|"Mexico's presidential transition provides a new window to discuss and debate the best security strategies to deal with the serious [[Mexican Drug War|violence plaguing]] Mexico ...

In response to the report, the [[Federal government of Mexico]] rejected the claims of the U.S. Senate and stated that the government has worked extensively to disband the criminal groups, reform its courts and judicial system, improve its [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Federal Police]], and strengthen the capacity of the [[Mexican Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name=rechaza&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite news|title=México rechaza un informe del Senado de EU sobre el combate al narcotráfico|url=http://blogs.cnnmexico.com/ultimas-noticias/2012/07/13/mexico-rechaza-un-informe-del-senado-de-eu-sobre-el-combate-al-narcotrafico/|accessdate=14 July 2012|newspaper=CNNMéxico|date=13 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hWcXMya?url=http://blogs.cnnmexico.com/ultimas-noticias/2012/07/13/mexico-rechaza-un-informe-del-senado-de-eu-sobre-el-combate-al-narcotrafico/|archivedate=5 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also warned that their actions will be worthless and insufficient if the United States does not assume responsibility in stopping the flow of weapons to Mexico, combating money laundering, and reducing drug consumption.&lt;ref name=rechaza/&gt;

==Controversies and accusations towards the Mexican government of misuse of the PGR and its resources ==
===Accusations of lack of protection towards news journalists and of misuse of Pegasus software to spy them===
Far from only being receiving accusations of spreading fake news, the Mexican government of EPN has also been accused of violence towards news journalists, and of spying on them, and also towards civil right leaders and their families. During his tenure as president, Peña Nieto has been accused of failing to protect news journalists, whose deaths are speculated to be politically triggered, by politicians attempting to prevent them from covering political scandals. The New York Times published a news report on the matter titled, "In Mexico it's easy to kill a journalist", on it mentioning how during EPN's government, Mexico became one of the worst countries in which to be a journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/world/americas/veracruz-mexico-reporters-killed.html|title=In Mexico, ‘It’s Easy to Kill a Journalist’|first=Azam|last=Ahmed|date=29 April 2017|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assassination of journalist [[Javier Valdez]] on May 23, 2017 received national coverage, with multiple news journalists asking for "real protection", as well as freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aristeguinoticias.com/1505/mexico/indignante-asesinato-de-javier-valdez-pena-pgr-lo-investiga/|title="Indignante" asesinato de Javier Valdez: Peña; PGR lo investiga|website=aristeguinoticias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aristeguinoticias.com/2105/mexico/compromiso-real-contra-la-impunidad-exigen-periodistas-tras-asesinato-de-javier-valdez/|title=Compromiso real contra la impunidad, exigen periodistas tras asesinato de Javier Valdez|website=aristeguinoticias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president announced to be "deeply wounded" by such death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aristeguinoticias.com/1705/mexico/profunda-herida-por-asesinatos-de-periodistas-dice-epn-y-anuncia-3-acciones/|title="Profunda herida" por asesinatos de periodistas, dice EPN y anuncia 3 medidas|website=aristeguinoticias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aristeguinoticias.com/2305/mexico/exigen-que-no-haya-impunidad-en-el-caso-de-miroslava-breach/|title=Exigen que no haya impunidad en el caso de Miroslava Breach|website=aristeguinoticias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this Mexican citizens, as well as political party of opposition perceived the presidential words as hypocritical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aristeguinoticias.com/0903/mexico/yunes-y-amlo-se-enfrentan-en-nuevo-round-de-acusaciones-nota-y-video/|title=Yunes y AMLO se enfrentan en nuevo round de acusaciones (Nota y Video)|website=aristeguinoticias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the outlook does not look favorable with Mexico already leading as the country most journalist killed in 2017, with 5 assassinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/killed/2017/|title=Committee to Protect Journalists|website=cpj.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/killed/americas/mexico/|title=Committee to Protect Journalists|website=cpj.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2017, ''[[The New York Times]]'' in conjunction with news reporter [[Carmen Aristegui]], and even backed by a [[Televisa]] news reporter [[Carlos Loret de Mola]], reported that the Mexican Government uses a [[spyware]] [[software]] known as Pegasus, to spy on targets such as Mexican News reporters (and their families) and Civil Rights Leaders (and their families) using text messages as lures. Since 2011, the Mexican Government invested $80 million worth of spyware. Pegasus spyware infiltrates a persons cellphone and reports every detail of their messages, e-mails, contacts and calendars. After the revelation, the Israeli manufacturer of the Pegasus spyware, [[NSO Group]], re-stated it only sold such technology to governments with an 'explicit agreement', that such technology was meant 'only to combat organized crime' by spying on it; although once it sells the software it cannot control who they use it against and basically leaves the government's on their own to monitor themselves on not abusing the software. The New York Times and independent forensic analysts analyzed the data of 'dozens of messages', multiple times before proving their accusation, and commented of such espionage towards news journalists and civil rights leaders, as 'an effort from the Mexican Government to thwart the battle against corruption infecting every limb of Mexican Society', and how highly unlikely it would be for such espionage it to receive 'Judicial Approval'.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/world/americas/mexico-spyware-anticrime.html|title=Using Texts as Lures, Government Spyware Targets Mexican Journalists and Their Families|first1=Azam|last1=Ahmed|first2=Nicole|last2=Perlroth|date=19 June 2017|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/19/mexico-cellphone-software-spying-journalists-activists|title=Mexico accused of spying on journalists and activists using cellphone malware|first=David|last=Agren|date=19 June 2017|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Snowden]] who worked for US government's [[NSA]] before revealing it to spy on its citizens, also said all evidence points to the Mexican government being the spy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aristeguinoticias.com/1708/mexico/rastros-de-espionaje-en-mexico-apuntan-a-que-fue-el-gobierno-snowden-en-videoconferencia/|title=Rastros de espionaje en México apuntan a que fue el gobierno: Snowden en videoconferencia|website=aristeguinoticias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on twitter said it is "a crime to the public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=Snowden|author=Edward Snowden|number=877289712440008704|date=20 June 2017|title=No importa si es una sorpresa, o si nos advirtieron.

The hacking attempts were 'highly personalized' for each target, they would consist of sending text messages with an attached link, and for the spyware to enter a users smartphone, all it needed was for the smartphone owner to click on the link. The news reporter Carmen Aristegui, whom previously in 2014, had revealed a conflict of interest regarding the president ownership of a Mexican "Casa Blanca (White House)" and was unfairly fired from her job for airing such investigation, herself, received 22 hacking attempts, the most for any journalist who has been found targeted, one of those attempts disguised as a message sent by an American Embassy in Mexico, trying to help her with a problem with her [[Travel visa|Visa]]; additionally Aristegui's son Emilio Aristegui received attempts for 23 months despite being an under-age 16-year-old teen. News media perceived attempts at Aristegui as revenge from the Mexican government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aristeguinoticias.com/1906/mexico/gobiernoespia-a-emilio-aristegui/|title=#GobiernoEspía a Emilio Aristegui|website=aristeguinoticias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; News reporter Carlos Loret de Mora received 8 attempts. While, Juan E. Pardinas, the director of the ''[[Mexican Institute of Competitiveness]]'', also received multiple attempts where he was told men with guns were outside his house and another where a contact not on his list invited him to his father's funeral because saying he was a "close friend", the attempt on his wife went as far as claiming Padilla was having an [[extramarital affair]], but she could only see the evidence if she clicked the link. Also, most of the parents, protesters and the major leaders of the investigations of the "Ayotzinapa, 43 Students Massacre" received spyware messages, so did the "Women of Atenco" (a scandal directly tied to Enrique Peña Nieto's time as Governor of the State of Mexico).The New York Times article contained a picture of EPN.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/491554/pena-espia-a-defensores-los-43-a-loret-aristegui-al-hijo-la-periodista-nyt|title=Peña espía a defensores de los 43, a Loret, Aristegui y hasta al hijo de la periodista: NYT - Proceso|date=19 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/nacion/sociedad/2017/06/19/nyt-afirma-que-gobierno-de-epn-espia-periodistas-y-activistas|title=NYT afirma que gobierno de EPN espía a periodistas y activistas|date=19 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2017, the day after. The opposition political party, National Action Party (PAN) denounced the Mexican government to the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] for suspicions of violations towards [[human rights]] and requested them, to lead an investigation citing such spying causes violations towards the article 16th of the Mexican Constitution, as well as violating article 11th of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aristeguinoticias.com/2206/mexico/denuncia-pan-espionaje-gubernamental-ante-la-cidh/|title=Denuncia PAN espionaje gubernamental ante la CIDH|website=aristeguinoticias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While, in response to the accusations, Peña Nieto made public that such technology was bought and indeed used by the Mexican government, but he denied misuses, and stated that it was only used to protect Mexicans by searching for criminal by saying he "also felt spied upon, but there was nothing more fake than blaming the (Mexican) government", and that there was "no proof";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aristeguinoticias.com/2206/mexico/epn-dice-que-tambien-se-siente-espiado-pero-nada-mas-falso-que-culpar-al-gobierno/|title="Espero que la ley se aplique" contra quienes señalaron que #GobiernoEspía: EPN (Video)|website=aristeguinoticias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying he ordered the PGR an investigation and that he hoped "under the law, it can be applied against those that have raised false accusations against the government.", with the last part of the quote making journalist hacking victims feel threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/world/americas/mexico-pena-nieto-hacking-pegasus.html|title=Mexican President Says Government Acquired Spyware but He Denies Misuse|first=Azam|last=Ahmed|date=22 June 2017|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Which forced the Mexican president to call writer of the article [[Azam Ahmed]] to tell him, he was not menacing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=azamsahmed|author=Azam Ahmed|number=878053320551575552|date=23 June 2017|title=Me llamó presidencia para decirme que @EPN no nos estaba amenazando, ni a la sociedad civil.

===Accusations of the Internal Security Law violating Human rights===
In November 2017, Aristegui Noticias reported that "the PRI and their allies were seeking to approve the "Ley de Seguridad Interior (Law of Internal Security)". Whom the Mexican [[CNDH|National Human Rights Commission (CNDH)]] had previously said, that it violated [[Human Rights]], because it favors the discretional usage of the army forces. Endangering citizens by giving a blank check to the army" and the president, to order an attack towards any group of people they consider a danger without requiring an explanation. This could include people such as social activists.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/AristeguiOnline/status/936399552122380292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://aristeguinoticias.com/3011/mexico/mas-poder-al-presidente-y-a-las-fuerzas-armadas-las-entranas-de-la-ley-de-seguridad-interior/&lt;/ref&gt; Enrique Peña Nieto signed off the law in approval, while CNDH decided to demand the Mexican government until the law fits a criteria that does not violate human rights.&lt;ref&gt;https://thewire.in/206138/mexican-national-human-rights-commission-likely-take-legal-action-security-law/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Mexico-Human-Rights-Watchdog-to-Challenge-Security-Law-in-Court-20171222-0023.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/mexicos-president-signs-internal-security-law-before-court-review-2017-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations towards EPN's government blocking its own investigations against corruption and of misuse of the PGR to interfere in the presidential election 2018===
[[New York Times]] published an article of December 2017, describing accusations towards EPN's government blocking its own investigations against corruption in the Mexican government, with a commissioner saying the Mexican government preventing the establishment of an impartial leader in the FEPADE in charge of investigating political corruption.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/world/americas/mexico-corruption-commission.html&lt;/ref&gt; Previously mentioned 22 ex-governors all members of the PRI political party are investigated for corruption with only five jailed.

By March 2018 in the dawn of the next presidential election, the PGR made official an investigation regarding PAN's candidate Ricardo Anaya laundering money. Ex-chief of FEPADE (the Mexican government's branch focused on political crimes), Santiago Nieto, whom the previous October had been controversially removed from his job as chief of FEPADE, coincidentally right after starting an investigation regarding illicit campaign money from the 2012 presidential campaign, received by EPN and would be president of [[Pemex]], [[Emilio Lozoya]] from the Brazilian conglomerate [[Odebrecht]]. The ex-chief of FEPADE, said that the accusations towards Anaya were minor in comparison to Odebretch and EPN scandal, adding also the same opinion about the money lost by SEDESOL, to corrupt governors from the PRI such as [[Javier Duarte]] and Cesar Duarte, all while PRI's presidential candidate Jose Antonio Meade was the man in charge of SEDESOL (the scandal is known as "La Estafa Maestra (The Master Robbery)" and about $435 million pesos were lost).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animalpolitico.com/2018/01/robles-meade-estafa-maestra-sedesol/&lt;/ref&gt; The same week the PRI legislators were criticized for voting towards stopping the investigation of Odebretch against the wishes of Mexican people and organizations against corruption such as "Mexicanos contra la corrupcion (Mexicans against Corruption)".&lt;ref&gt;https://elpais.com/internacional/2018/03/07/actualidad/1520390316_791182.html&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation about Odebretch against [[Pemex]] leader at the time Lozoya, was legally stopped after, a judge controversially ordered it days after.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.culturacolectiva.com/noticias/jueza-suspende-investigacion-contra-lozoya-por-tiempo-indefinido/&lt;/ref&gt; Satiago Nieto said that the PGR was being used as tool by EPN's government to tamper elections and benefit Meade by removing Anaya from the race, complaining that it was not neutral the manner in whom the law enforcing organizations had made more effort to investigate Anaya in a month than towards investigating EPN's Odebretch money and Meade's SEDESOL lost money in the last six years. Going as far as saying the PGR and FEPADE were only attacking the rivals of the PRI, and saying the organizations were not being neutral.&lt;ref&gt;https://aristeguinoticias.com/0203/mexico/por-menos-que-lo-que-ha-hecho-la-pgr-contra-anaya-me-removieron-a-mi-santiago-nieto/&lt;/ref&gt;

Javier Duarte went to jail in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-corruption/jailed-former-mexican-governor-starts-hunger-strike-over-witch-hunt-idUSKCN1AY0D8&lt;/ref&gt; though, Cesar Duarte despite the overwhelming evidence against him, in March 2018, the PGR found him innocent of any crime. The successor governor Javier Corral from the PAN, who previously fought against the [[Televisa|Televisa law]], gave a similar opinion to Santiago Nieto, saying the PGR was being used to protect the allies of EPN and the PRI, and attack their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reforma.com/aplicacioneslibre/articulo/default.aspx?id=1346330&amp;md5=2f59936ad96e8f39cfeaa31398842aa7&amp;ta=0dfdbac11765226904c16cb9ad1b2efe&amp;hootPostID=b87bc35a1b1c3e2e80eff9c658ae612b&lt;/ref&gt; AMLO said that not preceding towards Duarte, is one of the main reasons Mexicans lost their faith in the PRI, saying the few ex-governors declared criminals were only to simulate they care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.proceso.com.mx/526180/por-acciones-como-no-proceder-contra-cesar-duarte-la-gente-ya-no-le-cree-al-pri-amlo&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[The Wall Street Journal]], Santiago Nieto would later reveal that EPN's government tried to bribe him to keep him silent, which he refused saying “Sorry, but I can’t receive any money from Peña Nieto.”, he received menaces through phone messages with the words "Death follows you" and "Words of advice: stay out of Trouble", as a consequence he revealed to fear for the life of himself and his family.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-mexican-prosecutor-says-he-was-fired-to-stymie-corruption-probe-1521062636&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal defenses}}
{{Use Australian English|date=May 2018}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}
In the [[criminal law]] of [[Australia]], '''self-defence''' is a [[Defense (legal)|legal defence]] to a charge of causing injury or death in defence of the person or, to a limited extent, property, or a partial defence to [[murder]] if the degree of force used was excessive.

==Self-defence in murder==
In ''Viro v The Queen'',&lt;ref name="Viro v The Queen"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|9|1978|litigants=Viro v The Queen |parallelcite=(1978) 141 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 88 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Mason (judge)|Justice Mason]] formulated six propositions on the law of self-defence in murder trials. Thus, a full acquittal is achieved if the jury finds that an accused reasonably believed they were threatened with death or serious bodily harm and, if so, that the force used was reasonably proportionate to the perceived danger.
In ''Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions'',&lt;ref name="Zecevic"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|26|1987|litigants=Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) |parallelcite=(1987) 162 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 645 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the victim rented a unit from the defendant. The defendant became increasingly annoyed with the victim who kept leaving the security gates of the unit unlocked. After one heated exchange, the defendant was stabbed by the tenant. The defendant, fearing that the tenant was about to get a gun from his car, rushed off and got his shotgun. The defendant returned, and shot and killed the tenant. The majority of the High Court said at 661:&lt;ref name="R v Howe"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|38|1958|litigants=R v Howe |parallelcite=(1958) 100 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 448 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R v Katarzynski"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|613|2002|litigants=R v Katarzynski |courtname=[[Supreme Court of NSW|Supreme Court]] (NSW) |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:The question to be asked in the end is quite simple. It is whether the accused believed upon reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self-defence to do what he did. If he had that belief and there were reasonable grounds for it, or if the jury is left in reasonable doubt about the matter, then he is entitled to an acquittal. Stated in this form, the question is one of general application and is not limited to cases of homicide.

The [[New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal]] in ''R v Burgess; R v Saunders'' held that 'the concept of self-defence only arises where the actions of the accused by way of self-defence are directly taken against the person threatening the accused or another’s being or property.'&lt;ref name="R v Burgess"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|52|2005|litigants=R v Burgess; R v Saunders |courtname=[[New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal|Court of Criminal Appeal]] (NSW) |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colosimo"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|293|2006|litigants=Colosimo v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) |date=2 November 2006 |courtname=[[New South Wales Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (NSW)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant v R"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|67|2014|litigants=Grant v R |courtname=[[New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal|Court of Criminal Appeal]] (NSW) |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''R v Conlon'' the accused used a shotgun to repel two trespassers whom he believed to be stealing his cannabis plants. His belief was affected by drunkenness and a schizoid personality disorder which were relevant to determine whether the Crown had proved that he had not acted in self defence: specifically whether he believed that it was necessary to do what he did and whether that was a reasonable belief. This question seems advantageous to the defence because it tests whether the belief is reasonable to the accused (a subjective test), not reasonable to the reasonable person (objective test).&lt;ref&gt;''R v Conlon'' (1993) 69 [[Australian Criminal Reports|A Crim R]] 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In NSW, ss 418-423 of the ''Crimes Act 1900'' now govern the law relating to self-defence and excessive self-defence (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|418}}-423.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under South Australian law, the general defence appears in s15(1) Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) for defending a person's life, and s15A(1) for defending property, subject to a hybrid test, i.e. the defendant honestly believed the threat to be imminent and made an objectively reasonable and proportionate response to the circumstances as the accused subjectively perceived them.

In July 2003, the Rann Government (SA) introduced laws allowing householders to use "whatever force they deem necessary" when confronted with a home invader. 
Householders who kill or injure a home invader escape prosecution provided they can prove they had a genuine belief that it was necessary to do so to protect themselves or their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|SA|num_act|clcdaa200328o2003461|Criminal Law Consolidation (Self Defence) Amendment Act 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The law was strongly opposed by then-Director of Public Prosecutions [[Paul Rofe (barrister)|Paul Rofe]], {{post-nominals|country=AUS|QC}}, and lawyer Marie Shaw, who is now a District Court Judge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,21134744-2682,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excessive force==
The rationale of the defence recognises that the degree of [[culpability]] normally associated with murder may be missing. In the High Court case of ''Viro v The Queen'',&lt;ref name="Viro v The Queen"/&gt; [[Keith Aickin|Aickin J]] said:
:[There is] a real distinction in the degree of culpability of an accused who has killed having formed the requisite intention without any mitigating circumstance, and an accused who, in response to a real or a reasonably apprehended attack, strikes a blow in order to defend himself, but uses force beyond that required by the occasion and thereby kills the attacker.&lt;ref name="Viro v The Queen"/&gt;{{rp|p 180}}

The defence was first recognised in the [[common law]] in ''R v McKay'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|79|1957|litigants=R v McKay |parallelcite=[1957] [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 560 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of Victoria|Supreme Court]] (Vic) (Full Court)|date=16 April 1957}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where a farmer shot and fatally wounded a chicken thief, and confirmed in ''R v Howe'' where [[Herbert Mayo (judge)|Mayo J]] held at 121-122:
:A person who is subjected to a violent and felonious attack and who, in endeavouring, by way of self-defence, to prevent the consummation of that attack by force exercises more force than a reasonable man [sic] would consider necessary in the circumstances, but no more than what he [or she] honestly believed to be necessary in the circumstances, is guilty of [[manslaughter]] and not of murder.{{refn|''R v Howe'' (1958) [[South Australian State Reports|SASR]] 95, [[Supreme Court of South Australia|Supreme Court]] (SA) (Full Court). Affirmed on appeal to the High Court.&lt;ref name="R v Howe"/&gt;}}
This mitigatory defence was abolished in ''Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions''&lt;ref name="Zecevic"/&gt; which expressed the view that [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] should be the alternative considered. The defence was re-introduced in statutory form in South Australia in 1991, revised in 1997. The Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) s15 now reads:
:(2) It is a partial defence to a charge of murder (reducing the offence to manslaughter) if:
::(a) the defendant genuinely believed the conduct to which the charge relates to be necessary and reasonable for a defensive purpose; but
::(b) the conduct was not, in the circumstances as the defendant genuinely believed them to be, reasonably proportionate to the threat that the defendant genuinely believed to exist.
:(3) For the purposes of this section, a person acts for a defensive purpose if the person acts:
::(a) in self defence or in defence of another; or
::(b) to prevent or terminate the unlawful imprisonment of himself, herself or another.
s15A  extends the partial defence to circumstances where the accused had applied excessive force in killing the deceased but had genuinely
believed the force to be necessary and reasonable:
:(i) to protect property from unlawful appropriation, destruction, damage or interference; or
:(ii) to prevent criminal trespass to land or premises, or to remove from land or premises a person who is committing a criminal trespass; or
:(iii) to make or assist in the lawful arrest of an offender or alleged offender or a person who is unlawfully at large; and '''the defendant did not intend to cause death''' (emphasis added).
In 2002, New South Wales reintroduced excessive self defence as s421 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Section 421 states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|421}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:(1) This section applies if: 
::(a) the person uses force that involves the intentional or reckless infliction of death, and
::(b) the conduct is not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them, but the person believes the conduct is necessary:
::(c) to defend himself or herself or another person, or
::(d) to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty or the liberty of another person.
:(2) The person is not criminally responsible for murder but, on a trial for murder, the person is to be found guilty of manslaughter if the person is
otherwise criminally responsible for manslaughter.

Unlike South Australian law, s420 of the NSW Crimes Act explicitly states that self-defence is ''not'' available as a defence to murder if death is inflicted to prevent criminal trespass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, pursuant to recommendations from the Law Reform Commission for Victoria, the Victorian legislature introduced new laws regarding self defence. Among them, a new offence of defensive homicide was created: where the accused's belief in the need for the force applied in self-defence was unreasonable, s/he may be convicted of an offence less serious than murder. However, defensive homicide was abolished in November 2014.

It is simply defines a limitation on the user's access rights.&lt;ref name="RaysmanPisacreta"/&gt; The usage of the term dates back to 1950s, when [[mainframes]] limited to a specific sites were being used. Nowadays, these types of licenses are rare, but still used in some sectors like manufacturing. Vendors may insert clauses that would allow representatives to visit the site and verify that the software usage confirms to the license.&lt;ref name="LandyMastrobattista2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gene K. Landy|author2=Amy J.

The cost of the license can then be analyzed in terms of '''cost per installed seat''', with the idea being that such cost must be lower if site licensing is to be advantageous over individual licensing.

Another usage of the "site licensing" term refers to the deals made by large institutions, like universities, with software firms so that affiliated persons can buy the software at discounted prices.&lt;ref name="LandyMastrobattista2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=colorado_u&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Licenses|url=http://www.colorado.edu/oit/software-hardware/site-licenses|publisher=[[University of Colorado]]|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Country Justice''''' was written by [[Michael Dalton (legal writer)|Michael Dalton]] and first published in 1618. The subtext reads: Conteyning the Practise of the Justices of the Peace Out of Their Sessions, Gathered for the Better Helpe of Such Justices of Peace as Have Not Beene Much Conversant in the Studie of the Lawes of this Realme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Countrey Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Countrey_Justice.html?id=0uwamBNUhtwC&amp;redir_esc=y|website=Google Books|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is a manual which was used by English [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]]. It went through about 20 editions between its first edition in 1618 and the last in 1746. With its roots in Crompton, [[Fitzherbert]] and [[Lambarde|Lambard]], the book offers advice on a wide range of issues including levying customs, highways, prisons, riots, soldiers, murder, felonies, rogues, vagabonds, wool and high treason. The alphabetical listing of topics was groundbreaking and was a model for the structure of other books that came later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Country Justice|url=http://www.lawbookexchange.com/pages/books/56682/michael-dalton/the-countrey-justice-conteyning-the-practice-of-the-justices-of|website=The Lawbook Exchange|accessdate=8 June 2014|quote=Rooted in Crompton, Fitzherbert and Lambard, The Countrey Justice offers advice on such matters as customs, highways, prisons, riots, soldiers, murder, felonies, rogues and vagabonds, wool, and high treason.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Country Justice was one of many, but perhaps the most influential, of legal handbooks through which [[English common law]] entered into the legal system of early settlement in [[New England]]. Dalton was a justice of the peace in [[Cambridge]] and wrote this handbook to guide local justices of the peace who had no formal legal training. The simple, direct writing style contributed to the popularity of the book both in England and in the colonies. There was an earlier handbook, also alphabetized, written by William Lambarde, called the Eirenarcha. By 1619 Lambarde’s book had already seen 13 editions.

Included among the many issues dealt with in The Country Justice were guidelines to deal with [[witchcraft]] and [[witches]]. Dalton emphasized the need for body searches to find evidence of demonic contacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McManus|first1=Edgar J.|title=Law and Liberty in Early New England: Criminal Justice and Due Process|date=1993|publisher=The University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=978-1-55-849-772-6|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CkNMR7L68I0C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=the+country+justice+michael+dalton&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZbhCOBF6_v&amp;sig=6YYuDzuHHsBHjBd2nLG3-DhDm3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XVqUU8S6KsiI7AbNyIHQDw&amp;ved=0CGYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=country%20justice%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Ireland]], and certain other [[English common law]] [[jurisdiction]]s, a '''trainee solicitor''' is a prospective [[lawyer]] undergoing professional training at a [[law firm]] to qualify as a full-fledged [[solicitor]].  This period of training is known as a [[training contract]] and usually lasts for two years.

The [[barrister]]'s equivalent would be twelve months' [[pupillage]] under a [[pupilmaster]], in [[chambers (law)|barristers' chambers]], or for [[advocates]] in Scotland, eight or nine months [[devilling]] under a [[devilmaster]].

==Route==

=== {{flagicon|ENG}} England and {{flagicon|Wales}} Wales ===
Before they are eligible to train, the trainee must first have an undergraduate [[L.L.B.|degree in law]], or another degree and later taken a conversion course (i.e. the [[Common Professional Examination]] or Graduate Diploma in Law), and then completed the [[Legal Practice Course]] (LPC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://l2b.thelawyer.com/training-contracts/3010215.article Training contracts]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the training contract, trainees are required to gain practical experience in at least three distinctive areas of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/law-careers/becoming-a-solicitor/training-contracts/ Law Society]&lt;/ref&gt; On successful completion of the training contract, the trainee will qualify and be admitted as a solicitor.

Trainee solicitors and training contracts were formerly known as [[articled clerk]]s and articles of clerkship, respectively.

=== {{flagicon|SCO}} Scotland ===
In Scotland the system is similar to that in England and Wales. In order to become a trainee solicitor, the student must complete an undergraduate [[L.L.B.|degree in law]], or complete the [[Law Society of Scotland]] examinations, before undertaking a one-year [[Diploma in Legal Practice]]. This qualifies the graduate to receive an Entrance Certificate and begin a traineeship.

Traineeships are obtained through the open job market and there is no guarantee that a graduate will secure one. Over the last five years, 24% of Diploma graduates have not started traineeships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawscot.org.uk/education-and-careers/studying-law/currently-studying-the-llb-/information-about-traineeship-numbers Law Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224544/http://www.lawscot.org.uk/education-and-careers/studying-law/currently-studying-the-llb-/information-about-traineeship-numbers |date=2013-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trainees must complete at least 60 hours of Trainee Continuing Professional Development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawscot.org.uk/education-and-careers/the-traineeship/during-your-traineeship Law Society]&lt;/ref&gt; After one year, the trainee can apply for admission as a solicitor, allowing them to appear in court.

On successful completion of the traineeship, the traineeship is discharged and the trainee will be eligible for a Practising Certificate.

=== Work placements ===
Work placements allow students a brief (normally two-week) experience within the working environment of a firm of solicitors. Interested students may find local opportunities through their school's or university's career adviser, or apply direct to the firms of solicitors.

=== {{flagicon|HKG}} Hong Kong ===
In [[Legal system of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], the route is generally identical to that in England and Wales (above), save with the substitution of the [[Postgraduate Certificate in Laws|Postgraduate Certificate in Laws course]] for the LPC.

'''U.S. Bank Building''', formerly 190 South LaSalle Street, is a {{convert|573|ft|m}} tall skyscraper in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. It was completed in 1987 and has 40 floors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=190southlasalle-chicago-il-usa 190 South LaSalle, Chicago, U.S.A. | Emporis.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnson/Burgee Architects]] designed the building, which is the 57th [[List of tallest buildings in Chicago|tallest building in Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=3137 190 South LaSalle, Chicago - SkyscraperPage.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1988-2016 the lobby of the building featured a tapestry by [[Helena Hernmarck]] titled "The 1909 Plan of Chicago" depicting the Civic Center Plaza proposed in the [[Burnham Plan of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=David| last=McCracken| title=A stitch in time| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-01-24/entertainment/8803240910_1_tapestry-color-burnham-project| newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]| date=24 January 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, U.S. Bank announced it agreed to increase its leased space in the structure from {{convert|66,000|sqft|m2}} to {{convert|110,000|sqft|m2}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1460">The '''Unemployment Insurance Act 1920''' was an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom. It created the dole (weekly cash [[unemployment benefits]]) system of payments to unemployed workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. R. Garside|title=British Unemployment 1919-1939: A Study in Public Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TIp3oq398IC&amp;pg=PA37|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act passed at a time of very little unemployment, when the Conservatives dominated Parliament. It set up the dole system that provided 15 weeks of unemployment benefits to over 11 million workers--practically the entire civilian working population except domestic service, farm workers, railway workers, and civil servants.  Funded in part by weekly contributions from both employers and employed, it provided weekly payments of 15s for unemployed men and 12s for unemployed women.  Historian [[Charles Loch Mowat]] calls this legislation "Socialism by the back door," and notes how surprised politicians were when the costs to the Treasury soared during the high unemployment of 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars: 1918-1940'' (1955) pp 43-46&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Nations Convention on Environmental Modification''' is a [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|resolution of the United Nations General Assembly]] which adopted the [[Environmental Modification Convention]] (ENMOD), formally known as the '''Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques''' adopted on 10 December 1976 at the 31st Session of the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]]. The [[Treaty|convention]] aims to prohibit the military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques that have widespread, long-lasting, or severe effects. The convention entered into force on 5 October 1978.

==History==
According to the historical narrative of the [[U.S. Department of State]], "although the use of environmental modification techniques for hostile purposes does not play a major role in military planning at the present time," the [[U.S. Government]] sought that such techniques might be developed in the future and "would pose a threat of serious damage unless action was taken to prohibit their use." Accordingly, in July 1972, the U.S. Government renounced the use of [[weather warfare|climate modification techniques for hostile purposes]], even if their development were proved to be feasible in the future. The following year, they called for international agreement to avoid the military use of environmental and geophysical modifications and, after exploring the possible uses, reached out to the [[former Soviet Union]] (USSR). In 1974 and 1975, [[U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] and Soviet [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]] held three sets of discussions on the issue. In 1975, the two nations began negotiating specific terms at the [[Conference on Disarmament|Conference of the Committee on Disarmament]] (CCD). Finalized in 1976, the agreed text was sent to the UN General Assembly for consideration during the fall session. On 10 December 1976, the resolution was approved with 96 to 8 votes, 30 abstaining.&lt;ref&gt;

In the treaty text "Environmental Modification Technique" is defined as follows:
{{quotation|As used in article I, the term "environmental modification techniques" refers to any technique for changing-through the deliberate manipulation of natural processes-the dynamics, composition or structure of the Earth, including its biota, lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, or of outer space.|Article II, Environmental Modification Convention}}

The '''Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924''' greatly influenced the development of eugenics in the twentieth century. The act was based on model legislation written by [[Harry H. Laughlin]] and challenged by the Supreme Court decision of [[Buck v. Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | publisher=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia  | title=Sterilization Act of 1924  | author=Nathalie Antonios | url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/sterilization-act-1924 | access-date=June 8, 2015 | date= April 14, 2011 | issn=1940-5030}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court upheld the law; consequentially, proving that it was constitutional and making it [[model law]] for sterilization laws in other states.  [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Justice Holmes]] wrote that a patient may be sterilized "on complying with the very careful provisions by which the act protects the patients from possible abuse."&lt;ref&gt;Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200, 206, 47 S. Ct. 584, 584, 71 L. Ed. 1000 (1927)&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1924 and 1979, Virginia sterilized over 7,000 individuals under the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.uvm.edu/%7Elkaelber/eugenics/VA/VA.html | title=Eugenics: Compulsory Sterilization in 50 American States | author=Lutz Kaelber | publisher=[[University of Vermont]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act was never declared unconstitutional; however, in 2001, the Virginia General Assembly passed a joint resolution apologizing for the misuse of "a respectable, 'scientific' veneer to cover activities of those who held blatantly racist views."&lt;ref name="jr"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+sum+HJ607 | title=House Joint Resolution No. 607 (2001 Session) | publisher=[[Virginia General Assembly]] | access-date=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Assembly agreed to compensate individuals sterilized under the act.

==Historical background==
===Laughlin's Model Eugenical Sterilization Law===
During the early 20th century, Harry H. Laughlin, director of the Eugenics Record Office at [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York]], became concerned that states were not enforcing their eugenics laws.  In 1922, he published his book, ''Eugenical Sterilization in the United States'', which included a "MODEL EUGENICAL STERILIZATION LAW" in Chapter XV.&lt;ref&gt;Laughlin, [http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~wellerst/laughlin/Laughlin_Model_Law.cgi Chapter XV]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1924, 15 states had enacted similar legislation; however, unlike Virginia, many or most or all of those states failed to rigidly enforce their laws requiring specific qualities in all persons seeking to marry.  Forced sterilization, however, was much more common. By 1956, twenty-four states had laws providing for involuntary sterilization on their books. These states collectively reported having forcibly sterilized 59,000 people over the preceding 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Schreiber, ''THE MEN BEHIND HITLER: A German warning to the world,'' Trans. by H. R. Martindale, [http://www.toolan.com/hitler/append1.html "Appendix 1"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia implemented Laughlin's "Model Eugenical Sterilization Law" with little modification two years after it was published.

==Text from the 1924 Act==
{{Quote box

Chap. 394. - An ACT to provide for the sexual sterilization of inmates of State institutions in certain cases. [S B 281] 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Approved March 20, 1924.&lt;/center&gt;
{{indent|5}}Whereas, both the health of the individual patient and the welfare of society may be promoted in certain cases by the sterilization of mental defectives under careful safeguard and by competent and conscientious authority, and 
&lt;br&gt;
{{indent|5}}Whereas, such sterilization may be effected in males by the operation of vasectomy and in females by the operation of salpingectomy, both of which said operations may be performed without serious pain or substantial danger to the life of the patient, and 
&lt;br&gt;
{{indent|5}}Whereas, the Commonwealth has in custodial care and is supporting in various State institutions many defective persons who if now discharged or paroled would likely become by the propagation of their kind a menace to society but who if incapable of procreating might properly and safely be discharged or paroled and become self-supporting with benefit both to themselves and to society, and 
&lt;br&gt;
{{indent|5}}Whereas, human experience has demonstrated that heredity plays an important part in the transmission of sanity, idiocy, imbecility, epilepsy and crime, now, therefore

{{indent|5}}1. Be it enacted by the general assembly of Virginia, That whenever the superintendent of the Western State Hospital, or of the Eastern State Hospital, or of the Southwestern State Hospital, or of the Central State Hospital, or the [[Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded|State Colony for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded]], shall be of opinion that it is for the best interests of the patients and of society that any inmate of the institution under his care should be sexually sterilized, such superintendent is herby authorized to perform, or cause to be performed by some capable physicians or surgeon, the operation of sterilization on any such patient confined in such institution afflicted with hereditary forms of insanity that are recurrent, idiocy, imbecility, feeble-mindedness or epilepsy; provided that such superintendent shall have first complied with the requirements of this act. 
&lt;br&gt;
{{indent|5}}2. Such superintendent shall first present to the special board of directors of his hospital or colony a petition stating the facts of the case and the grounds of his opinion, verified by his affidavit to the best of his knowledge and belief, and praying that an order may be entered by said board requiring him to perform or have performed by some competent physician to be designated by him in his said petition or by said board in its order, upon the inmate of his institution named in such petition, the operation of vasectomy if upon a male and of salpingectomy if upon a female. 
&lt;br&gt;
{{indent|5}}A copy of said petition must be served upon the inmate together with a notice in writing designating the time and place in the said institution, not less than thirty days before the presentation of such petition to said special board of directors when and where said board may hear and act upon such petition

==Sterilization law after 1988==
An act, passed by the [[General Assembly of Virginia]] in 1988 and amended in 2013, provides the procedural requirements necessary for a physician to lawfully sterilize a patient capable of giving informed consent and incapable of giving informed consent.&lt;ref name="virginia"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[General Assembly of Virginia]] | title=Sexual Sterilization, Virginia Code §§ 54.1-2974 - 54.1-2980 | url=http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title54.1/chapter29/article7/ | access-date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A physician may perform a sterilization procedure on a patient if the patient is capable of giving informed consent, the patient consents to the procedure in writing, and the physician explains the consequences of the procedure and alternative methods of contraception.&lt;ref name="virginia"/&gt;  A court may authorize a physician to perform a sterilization on a mentally incompetent adult or child after the procedural requirements are met and the court finds with clear and convincing evidence the patient is or is likely to engage sexual activity, no other contraceptive is reasonably available, the patient's mental disability renders the patient permanently unable to care for a child, and the procedure conforms with medical standards.&lt;ref name="virginia"/&gt;

==Apology and compensation==
===Legislative history===
In February 2001, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] passed a [[joint resolution]], introduced by [[Mitchell Van Yahres]], expressing regret for Virginia's experience with eugenics.&lt;ref name="jr"/&gt;  In the 2002 session, Van Yahres introduced a joint resolution honoring the memory of Carrie Buck.  This joint resolution was passed by the House and Senate in February 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+sum+HJ299 | title=House Joint Resolution No. 299 | publisher=[[Virginia General Assembly]] | access-date=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In same year, [[Bob Marshall (Virginia politician) | Bob Marshall]], introduced a joint resolution referencing the 2001 eugenics resolution and calling for the establishment of a subcommittee to study issues related to stem cell research; however, this resolution did not pass the Rules committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+HJ148 | title=2003 Session House Joint Resolution No. 148 |publisher=[[Virginia General Assembly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 and 2014, Marshall introduced the Justice for Victims of Sterilization Act to give compensation for up to $50,000 per person; however, the bill did not get past the Appropriations committee in either year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+HB1529 | title=House Bill No.1529 (2013 Session) | publisher=[[Virginia General Assembly]] | access-date=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+HB74 | title=House Bill No. 74 (2014 Session) | publisher=[[Virginia General Assembly]] | access-date=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Patrick A. Hope reintroduced the Justice for Victims of Sterilization Act, and although the Act did not get past the Appropriations committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+HB1504 | title=House Bill No. 1504 (2015 Session) | publisher=[[Virginia General Assembly]] | access-date=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an amendment was added to the budget bill to give compensation of up to $25,000 per person who was "involuntarily sterilized pursuant to the Virginia Eugenical Sterilization Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hac.state.va.us/documents/2015/Post_Session/HAC%20Complete%20Summary%20Document.pdf | title=Summary of 2014-16 Budget Actions Chapter 665 (Introduced as House Bill 1400) | publisher= House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees | date=May 12, 2012 | access-date=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=151&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1400&amp;submit=GO | title= HB 1400 Budget Bill (2015 Session) | publisher=[[Virginia General Assembly]] | access-date=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hac.virginia.gov/committee/files/2015/2-24-15/Conference%20Report%20to%20HB%201400%20Side-by-Side%20Comparison.pdf | title=Comparison of House and Senate Budget Amendments House Bill 1400 and Senate Bill 800 | publisher= House Appropriations Committee Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="eligible"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://leg2.state.va.us/WebData/15amend.nsf/ebea1c0863d2f61b8525689e00349981/60099020ad316a1b85257df600456b89?OpenDocument | title=Budget Amendment Items, 2014-16 Biennium (HB5002/SB5003) | publisher=[[Virginia General Assembly]] | access-date=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eligibility for compensation===
The legislature authorized compensation of up to $25,000 per claim to provide compensation for individuals sterilized "pursuant to the Virginia Eugenical Sterilization Act and who were living as of February 1, 2015."  If the person died on or after February 1, 2015, a claim may be submitted by the estate or personal representative of the person who died.&lt;ref name ="eligible"/&gt;

===Public reception===
Lewis Reynolds, a [[United States Marine Corps]] veteran sterilized for epilepsy, said that he would be happy to get $25,000 dollars, but he would have preferred to get 
$50,000, the amount given under North Carolina's eugenics compensation program.&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web | title=Virginia’s forced sterilization victims each to get $25k restitution payments for eugenics program | url=http://rt.com/usa/238201-virginia-eugenics-victims-compensation/ | publisher=[[Russia Today]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Bold, CEO of the Christian Law Institute, stated that the language the legislature developed was overly broad and allowed social workers and communities to target individuals for sterilization for even trivial reasons.&lt;ref name="rt"/&gt;

==Opinion polls==
Various public opinion surveys of Washington residents asked questions regarding same-sex marriage. The questions vary, with some surveys referring directly to Referendum 74 and others asking more general questions. A post-election poll indicated much stronger support for such marriage among women than men across several categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Women in law''' describes the role played by women in the [[law|legal profession]] and related occupations, which includes [[lawyer]]s (also called [[barrister]]s, [[advocate]]s, [[solicitor]]s, [[Attorney at law|attorney]]s or legal counselors), [[paralegal]]s, [[prosecutor]]s (also called [[District Attorney]]s or [[Crown Prosecutor]]s), [[judge]]s, legal scholars (including [[feminist legal theory|feminist legal theorists]]), law professors and [[law school]] deans.

In the US, while women made up 34% of the legal profession in 2014, women are underrepresented in senior positions in all areas of the profession. There has been an increase in women in the law field from the 1970s to 2010, but the increase has been seen in entry level jobs. In the United States, 60% of attorneys are women; however, the percent of female equity partners is 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinnington|first1=Ashly|title=Lawyers' Professional Careers: Increasing Women's Inclusion in the Partnership of Law Firms.|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|date=November 2013|volume= 20|issue= 6|pages=616–631|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=8624e30e-cc90-471e-9ad7-c6045354837b%40sessionmgr4007&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=90674460|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women of color]] are even more underrepresented in the legal profession.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/marketing/women/current_glance_statistics_july2014.authcheckdam.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Current Glance at Women in the Law |date=July 2014 |website=Americanbar.com|accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In private practice law firms, women make up just 4% of managing partners in the 200 biggest law firms.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org"/&gt; In 2014 in [[Fortune 500]] corporations, 21% of the [[general counsel]]s were women, of which only 10.5% were African-American, 5.7% were Hispanic, 1.9% were Asian-American/Pacific Islanders, and 0% were Middle Eastern.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org"/&gt; In 2009, 21.6% of law school Deans were women.

Kristin Booth Glenn and Michelle J. Anderson at the [[City University of New York School of Law]].

In Canada, while 37.1% of lawyers are women, "50% ...said they felt their [law] firms were doing "poorly" or "very poorly" in their provision of flexible work arrangements."&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt; As well, "...[[Visible minority|racialized]] women accounted for 16% of all lawyers under 30" in 2006 in Ontario and women Aboriginal lawyers accounted for 1%.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt;

==Representation and working conditions==
===United States===
{{Main|Women in the United States judiciary}}
The [[American Bar Association]] reported that in 2014, women made up 34% of the legal profession and men made up 66%.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org" /&gt; In private practice law firms, women make up 20.2% of partners, 17% of equity partners and 4% of managing partners in the 200 biggest law firms.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org" /&gt;  At the junior level of the profession, women make up 44.8% of associates and 45.3% of summer associates.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org" /&gt; In 2014 in [[Fortune 500]] corporations, 21% of the [[general counsel]]s were women and 79% were men. Of these 21% of women general counsels, 81.9% were Caucasian, 10.5% were African-American, 5.7% were Hispanic, 1.9% were Asian-American/Pacific Islanders, and 0% were Middle Eastern.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org" /&gt; In 2009, women were 21.6% of law school Deans, 45.7% of Associate, Vice-Deans or Deputy Deans and 66.2% of Assistant Deans. Women have better representation on law school [[Law Review]]s. In the top 50 schools as ranked by ''US World and News Reports'' in 2012-2013, women made up 46% of leadership positions and 38% of editor-in-chief positions.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org" /&gt;

In 2012, women held 27.1% of all federal and state judge positions, while men held 73.9%.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org" /&gt; In 2014, three of nine Supreme Court justices were women (33%), 33% of Circuit Court of Appeals judges and 24% of federal court judges.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org" /&gt; Women held 27% of all state judge positions.

During the 2012-2013 academic year, women made up 47% of [[Juris Doctor]] (JD) students, people of color made up 25.8% of JD students.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; In 2009 in the US, women made up 20.6% of law school deans.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; In the US in 2014, 32.9% of all lawyers were women.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; 44.8% of law firm associates were women in 2013.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; In the 50 "best law firms for women" in the US, "19% of the equity partners were women,
29% of the nonequity partners were women, and 42% of... counsels were women.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt;

A survey indicates that 96% of US law firms state that their highest paid partner is male.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; 
"Only 24.1% of all federal judgeships were held by women, and only 27.5% of state judgeships were held by women.:&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; Women lawyers' salaries were "83% of men lawyers’ salaries in 2014".&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt;

===Canada===
In 2010 in Canada, "there were 22,261 practicing women lawyers and 37,617 practicing men lawyers." &lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; Canadian studies show that "50% of lawyers said they felt their firms were doing "poorly" or "very poorly" in their provision of flexible work arrangements."&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; More women lawyers found it "difficult to manage the demands of work and personal/family life" than men, with 75% of women reporting these challenges versus 66% of men associates.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; A 2010 report about Ontario lawyers from 1971 to 2006 indicates that "...racialized women accounted for 16% of all lawyers under 30, compared to 5% of lawyers 30 and older in 2006. Visible minority lawyers accounted for 11.5% of all lawyers in 2006. Aboriginal lawyers accounted for 1.0% of all lawyers in 2006.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt;

== Women of color ==

=== Representation ===
The National Association for Law Placement (NALP) found that every year since 2009 there has been a decline of African-American associates—“from 4.66 percent to 3.95 percent."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Liane|date=March 2016|title=Minority Women Are Disappearing from BigLaw--And Here's Why.|url=|journal=ABA Journal|volume=|pages=|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a November 2015 NALP press release, at just 2.55 percent of partners, minority women remain the most underrepresented group at partnership level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Treatment ===
In a 2008 survey, by the National Association of Women Lawyers (NAWL), the report found that women of color view their workplace as racially/ethnically stereotypical and exclusionary as a result. Women of color also felt that law firms were not taking enough action to increase diversity and when actions were taken they were not executed effectively.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2009|title=Women of Color Continue to Face Barriers in U.S. Law Firms, According to Catalyst Report.|url=|journal=Diversity Factor|volume=17|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The America Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession released a report which was a culmination of a study meant to address the decline of women of color in the legal profession. In the study, women of color were given the opportunity to express concern over the negative effects they faced in the workplace and how those effects carried into their personal life. Women of color reported feelings of exclusion, isolation, and as though they were receiving more unwanted critical attention than their counterparts.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Paulette|date=January 2009|title=Issues and Solutions Affecting Women of Color in the Law.|url=|journal=Minority Trial Lawyer|volume=7|pages=|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession when looking at reports on the treatment of women of color in the legal profession were disappointed with the patterns they noticed which led the American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession to undertake their own research in 2003, the Women of Color Research Initiative. In both law firms and corporate legal departments the findings were that women of color “receive less compensation than men and white women; are denied equal access to significant assignments, mentoring and sponsorship opportunities; receive fewer promotions; and have the highest rate of attrition.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is a ripple effect within the treatment of women of color. Women of color are put at a disadvantage early on making “the ultimate result that women of color miss opportunities to get better work assignments, more client contact, and more billable hours.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Women of color’s treatment within the legal profession and their feelings about this treatment have affected the retention of women of color in the legal profession. Women of color leave law firms at a high rate, “nearly 75 percent leave by their fifth year, and nearly 86 percent leave before their seventh year."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These women are leaving because they feel the only way to escape exclusion in the workplace is to leave the workplace.

=== Strategy ===
ABA's Commission on Women in the Profession released a report aimed at identifying challenges faced by women of color in law firms and found that “to overcome systemic discrimination against women of color, firms must recognize that the experiences of women of color are different from those of other groups; implementing changes to reflect this difference is necessary for retention. Firms and corporations must initiate active mentorship programs and encourage organization-wide discussions about issues concerning women of color, and constructive feedback is required.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  After the release of this report, several law firms have attempted the recommendations set forth by the report. Law firms began initiatives that focus on recruiting women of color as well as ensuring the retention of women of color as well. Recruiting of minority women has been increased through law firms finding summer associates by doing interviews “at the Southeast Minority Career Fair, MCCA/Vault Career Fair, Specialty Bar Association, Lavender Law Career Fair, and at schools such as Howard University School of Law and North Carolina Central School of Law.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Organizations==
===Center for Women in Law (US)===
The [[Center for Women in Law]] is a US organization set up and funded by women, says it is "devoted to the success of the entire spectrum of women in law ... serves as a national resource to convene leaders, generate ideas, and lead change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/law/centers/cwil/about-the-center/ |title=Center for Women in Law » About The Center |website=Utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It combines theory with practice, addressing issues facing individuals and the profession as a whole. The Center is a Vision 2020 National Ally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drexel.edu/vision2020/who/national-allies/Center%20for%20Women%20in%20Law/ Drexel University, College of Medicine, Vision 2020: national Allies - Center for Women in Law]. "Vision 2020 is a national coalition of organizations and individuals united in the commitment to achieve women’s economic and social equality. It was founded and administered by the Institute for Women's Health and Leadership at Drexel University College of Medicine."&lt;/ref&gt; The Center was founded in 2008 by a group of women, many of whom were alumnae of [[The University of Texas School of Law]], and many of whom graduated from law school in earlier decades when it was not common for women to pursue law as a career.  The group began discussing the issues faced by women lawyers and became determined to understand fully and address effectively the underlying causes of the barriers to advancement faced by women lawyers. The Austin Manifesto calls for specific, concrete steps to tackle the obstacles facing women in the legal profession today. The center holds summits and meetings on issues affecting women in the legal profession.

===National Women's Law Center (US)===
The [[National Women's Law Center]] (NWLC) is a [[United States]] [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1972 and based in Washington, D.C. The Center advocates for women's rights through litigation and policy initiatives. It began when female administrative staff and law students at the [[Center for Law and Social Policy]] demanded that their pay be improved, that the center hire female lawyers, that they no longer be expected to serve coffee, and that the center create a women's program.&lt;ref name="womensenews1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Naili |first=Hajer |url=http://womensenews.org/story/21-leaders-the-21st-century/111229/21-leaders-2012-seven-who-leverage-power |title=21 Leaders 2012 - Seven Who Leverage Power |publisher=Women's eNews |date=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcia Greenberger]] was hired in 1972 to start the program and [[Nancy Duff Campbell]] joined her in 1978.&lt;ref name="womensenews1" /&gt; In 1981, the two decided to turn the program into the separate National Women's Law Center.&lt;ref name="womensenews1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwlc.org/profile/marcia-greenberger |title=Marcia D.

===Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (Canada)===
[[Women's Legal Education and Action Fund]], referred to by the [[acronym and initialism|acronym]] LEAF, is the "...only national organization in Canada that exists to ensure the equality rights of women and girls under the law.".&lt;ref name="LEAF.ca"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://leaf.ca/ | title=Women's Legal Education and Action Fund | publisher=Women's Legal Education and Action Fund | accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established on April 19, 1985, LEAF was formed in response to the enactment of [[Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] to ensure that there was fair and unbiased interpretation of women’s Charter rights by the courts. LEAF performs legal research and [[intervention (law)|intervenes]] in [[appeal|appellate]] and [[Supreme Court of Canada]] cases on women's issues . LEAF has been an intervener in many significant decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, particularly cases involving section 15 Charter challenges. In addition to its legal work, LEAF also organizes speaking engagements and projects that allow lawyers interested in women’s rights to educate one another, to educate the public, and to create collective responses to legal issues related to women’s equality. LEAF was created by founding mother [[Doris Anderson]] and other women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leaf.ca/about-leaf/history/ |title=History of LEAF - Women's Legal Education and Action Fund |website=Leaf.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in Law and Litigation (India)===
[[Women in Law and Litigation]] (WILL) was formed in India in 2014 by women lawyers, judges and legal professionals to deal with [[gender discrimination]] faced by women in the field of law. The litigating public prefers to deal with male lawyers.&lt;ref name="ie"&gt;{{cite news|title=Women lawyers have to work more to prove themselves: SC Judge Desai|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/women-lawyers-have-to-work-more-to-prove-themselves-sc-judge-desai/|accessdate=6 September 2014|agency=Indian Express|date=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society was formed under the supervision of [[Supreme Court of India]] and the justice of Supreme Court of India, [[Ranjana Desai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women have broken barriers of gender discrimination: SC judge|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/women-have-broken-barriers-of-gender-discrimination-sc-judge_1465598.html|accessdate=6 September 2014|agency=Zee News|date=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; WILL was formed to provide professional support, advocacy skills, and a platform for discussion on ways for development of women lawyers. 
Justice Hima Kohli of the High Court (Delhi) defined WILL as the society would be a "way to give back to the system for senior lawyers and legal practitioners who have "reached high positions".&lt;ref name="ie" /&gt;

==Feminist perspectives==
[[Feminist legal theory]], also known as feminist [[jurisprudence]], is based on the belief that the law has been fundamental in [[Patriarchy|women's historical subordination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fineman|first1=Martha A.|title=Feminist Legal Theory|journal=Journal of Gender, Social Policy and the Law|volume=13|issue=1|pages=13–32|url=http://www.iiav.nl/ezines/web/AmericanUniversityJournal/2005/No1/american/fineman.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project of feminist [[legal theory]] is twofold. First, feminist jurisprudence seeks to explain ways in which the law played a role in women's former subordinate status. Second, it is dedicated to changing women's status through a reworking of the law and its approach to [[gender]]. In 1984 [[Martha Fineman]] founded the [[Feminism and Legal Theory Project]] at the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]] to explore the relationships between [[feminist theory]], practice, and law, which has been instrumental in the development of feminist legal theory.

The [[liberalism|liberal]] model of [[equality under the law]] operates from within the liberal legal paradigm and generally embraces liberal values and the rights-based approach to law, though it takes issue with how the liberal framework has operated in practice. The difference model emphasizes the significance of [[gender differences]] and holds that these differences should not be obscured by the law, but should be taken into account by it. The dominance model views the legal system as a mechanism for the perpetuation of male dominance. Feminists from the [[postmodern]] camp have deconstructed the notions of objectivity and neutrality, claiming that every perspective is socially situated. See [[equality feminism]], [[difference feminism]], [[radical feminism]], and [[postmodern feminism]] for context.

Notable scholars include:
*[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]
*[[Catharine MacKinnon]]
*[[Martha Fineman]]
*[[Mari Matsuda]]

===Feminist philosophy of law===
Feminist [[philosophy of law]] "...identifies the pervasive influence of patriarchy on legal structures, demonstrates its effects on the material condition of women and girls, and develops reforms to correct gender injustice, exploitation, or restriction." &lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-law/ |title=Feminist Philosophy of Law (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |website=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist philosophy of law uses approaches drawn from "...[[feminist epistemology]], relational metaphysics, [[feminist political theory]], and other developments in [[feminist philosophy]] to understand how legal institutions enforce dominant masculinist norms."&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /&gt; In the contemporary era, feminist philosophy of law also takes account of approaches such as "...[[human rights|human rights theory]], [[postcolonial theory]], critical legal studies, critical [[race theory]], [[queer theory]], and [[disability studies]]." &lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /&gt; As with feminism in general, there are many subtypes of feminist philosophy of law, including "...radical, socialist and Marxist, relational, cultural, postmodern, dominance, difference, pragmatist, and liberal approaches." &lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /&gt; Feminist philosophers of law argue that "... law makes [[systemic bias]] (as opposed to personal biases of particular individuals) invisible, normal, entrenched, and thus difficult to identify and to oppose." &lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /&gt; Feminist philosophers of law view laws as "...patriarchal, reflecting ancient and almost universal presumptions of [[gender inequality]]." &lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /&gt; Some of the legal issues analyzed by feminist philosophers of law include [[marriage]], [[reproductive rights]] (e.g., pertaining to laws on [[abortion]]), the "commodification of the body" (as in [[sex work]]) and [[violence against women]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /&gt;

== History ==
In the United Kingdom, the first woman to pass a law degree was [[Eliza Orme]], who graduated from [[University College London]] in 1888. She was not allowed to qualify to practice as either a solicitor or a barrister. It was not until 1919, with the passage of the [[Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919]] that women could enter the legal profession. This had been challenged in 1914 in a case known as ''Bebb v Law Society'', in which the Court of Appeal found that women did not fall within the legal definition of "persons" and so could not become lawyers. The 1919 Act also allowed women to serve on juries for the first time.

===Canada===
[[File:Clara Brett Martin.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Canadian [[Clara Brett Martin]] became the first woman lawyer in the [[British Empire]] in 1897 after a lengthy dispute with the [[Law Society of Upper Canada]], which argued–unsuccessfully–that only men could become lawyers.]]  
At the end of the nineteenth century, Canadian women were barred from participation in, let alone any influence on or control over, the legal system–women could not become lawyers, magistrates, judges, jurors, voters or legislators. [[Clara Brett Martin]] (1874 &amp;ndash; 1923) became the first female lawyer in the British Empire in 1897 after a lengthy debate in which the [[Law Society of Upper Canada]] tried to prevent her from joining the legal profession. After graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1891, Martin submitted a petition to the Law Society to become a member. Her petition was rejected by the Society after contentious debate, with the Society ruling that only men could be admitted to the practice of law, because the Society's statute stated that only a "person" could become a lawyer. At that time, women were not considered to be "persons" in Canada, from a legal perspective. [[W.D. Balfour]] sponsored a bill that provided that the word "person" in the Law Society's statute should be interpreted to include females as well as males.  Martin’s cause was also supported by prominent women of the day including [[Emily Stowe]] and [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Lady Aberdeen]]. With the support of the Premier, [[Oliver Mowat]], legislation was passed on April 13, 1892, which permitted the admission of women as solicitors.
