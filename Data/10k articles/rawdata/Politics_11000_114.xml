      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12699">The '''2010 Hong Kong democracy protests''' reflect the growing force of the pro-democracy movement, and were sparked by events that year including electoral reforms&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the arrest of a high-profile Chinese activist, [[Liu Xiaobo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/08/nobel-peace-prize-liu-xiaobo|title=Nobel peace prize goes to Liu Xiaobo|last=Branigan|first=Tania|date=2010-10-08|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The democracy movements of 2010 can be seen as a precursor to the events of the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|2014 Umbrella Revolution]].

== Historical context ==

=== The Basic Law ===
Hong Kong, as a former British colony, was reunified with mainland China in 1997 under the concept of “[[One country, two systems|One Country, Two Systems]]”. While originally a concept with no legal power, a committee consisting of 59 members from different backgrounds and industries joined together after the signing of [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] to create the basic laws of the new Hong Kong under China based on the ideas stipulated in the Declaration and thus gave national legitimacy to the concept. Effective July 1, 1997, Hong Kong was to be treated as fully autonomous from mainland China. This is followed in the Declaration by the promise that “[Hong Kong] will remain unchanged for 50 years”, until 2047.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Basic Law and Hong Kong - The 15th Anniversary of Reunification with the Motherland|last=Wu|first=Bangguo|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=Hong Kong|pages=18–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democracy in Hong Kong ===
Hong Kong’s chief executive is chosen by an 800-member committee, while its legislature of 60 is half elected and half chosen by interest groups called functional constituencies, While a democratic style of government election is promised in Hong Kong’s constitution, China ruled in 2007 that Hong Kong cannot directly elect a leader until 2017 and its legislature until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1971283,00.html|title=Is Hong Kong Getting Any Closer to Real Democracy?|last=Rose|first=Adam|date=2010-03-11|work=Time|access-date=2018-01-21|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

=== New Year protest ===
According to figured offered by the Hong Kong police, 9000 people marched to Beijing’s representative office. Organizers claim that more than 30,000 protesters turned up to reignite the democracy movement at times when locals were preoccupied with economic issues. A diverse group of organizations joined the march but largely aligned themselves with three headline causes: 'true' [[universal suffrage]], abolition of the small-circle [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], and freedom for Chinese dissident Liu Xiabo. The exception was protesters opposing the location of a Hong Kong connection to the Mainland's national high-speed rail network through a New Territories village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2010-01-04|title=Hong Kong January 1 Democracy Demonstration: One March, Four Causes|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/10HONGKONG10_a.html|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters carried out colorful banners such as “Democracy Now!” Some demonstrators held aloft portraits of Liu Xiaobo, demanding the release of the prominent writer and activist. Hundreds of police erected steel barricades and with minor scuffles when they tried to prevent a small number of protesters from storming the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protest/thousands-in-new-year-hong-kong-march-for-democracy-idUSTRE6000CD20100101|title=Thousands in new year Hong Kong march for democracy|last=|first=|date=2010-01-01|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-01-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New year marches are a fixture on the political calendar in Hong Kong.

=== May 2nd protest ===
More than 3000 people marched from Victoria Park to the Central Government Offices to demand full democracy in Hong Kong in the [[2010 March for universal suffrage|May 2nd Protest]]. In January 2010, the Five Constituencies Referendum triggered a [[Hong Kong by-election, 2010|by-election]] when five pan-democrats stepped down. The protest happened a couple of weeks before the scheduled by-election on 16 May 2010, during which few politicians tried to turn it into a referendum on political reform that unsurprisingly failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16167654|title=Protest vote|website=The Economist|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== July 1st protest ===
[[Hong Kong 1 July marches|July 1st protests]] are annual protest rallies originally held by the [[Civil Human Rights Front]]. The holiday commemorates the day of handover from the [[United Kingdom]] to [[China]] in 1997 and the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The July 1st march in 2010 was the first public march for democracy in Hong Kong after the unprecedented acceptance by Beijing of a limited democratic reform proposal by the Democratic Party under a document titled the '[[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|Consultation Document on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive and for Forming the LegCo in 2012]]'. While this was seen by a step forward for Hong Kong, many were disappointed in the pan-democracy camp for going back on their word to settle for something less than pure universal suffrage. As a result, approximately 52,000 people took part in the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-467834|title=52,000 March for Suffrage in Hong Kong|website=CNN iReport|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anniversary parade was organized by opposition pro-government groups, attended by 2000 people. Several hundred democratic party members faced verbal abuse and chants such as “shame on you” and “you betrayed Hong Kong’s people” throughout the march to the Hong Kong government headquarters for selling out to Beijing.

=== League of Social Democrats and the Civic Party resignation ===
In January 10, five legislators from the [[Civic Party]] and the [[League of Social Democrats]], one from each of Hong Kong’s electoral districts resigned their seats as a part of the ‘Five Constituencies Resignation’ concept for meaningful political reform. [[Albert Chan]], [[Alan Leong]], [[Tanya Chan]], “Longhair” [[Leung Kwok-hung]], and [[Wong Yuk-man]] resigned from the Legislative Council of Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1773233/road-universal-suffrage-timeline-hong-kongs-journey-votes|title=The road to universal suffrage: A timeline of Hong Kong’s journey to votes for all|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention was to trigger by-elections by pitting pro-democracy candidates against pro-China ones in hopes for a de facto [[referendum]] on full democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-hong-kong-lawmakers-seek-referendum-on-democracy-2010jan26-story.html|title=Hong Kong lawmakers seek 'referendum' on democracy|last=Writer|first=MIN LEE, Associated Press|work=sandiegouniontribune.com|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Basic Law of Hong Kong does not provide for official referenda. Their resignations were submitted on 26 January 2010, with effect on 29 January 2010. They resigned in spite of Beijing warning them not to, Chief Executive [[Donald Tsang]] claimed that the “so-called referendum” had no legal grounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/26/hong-kong-democracy-bid|title=Hong Kong MPs quit in attempt to push Beijing towards direct elections|last=Kong|first=Associated Press in Hong|date=2010-01-26|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hong Kong by-election, 2010|by-elections]] were nevertheless held on 16 May 2010. Following a boycott by the pro-government parties, the five who resigned were returned to the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] by voters. The by-election was criticized as a waste of taxpayers’ money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8684996.stm|title=Hong Kong 'democracy' by-election|date=2010-05-15|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Arrest of Liu Xiaobo ===
Protesters called for the release of the Chinese activist [[Liu Xiaobo]], who was detained on 8 December 2008. He was formally arrested and sentenced to eleven years of imprisonment and two years’ deprivation of political rights on 25 December 2009 for “inciting subversion of state power” in the manifesto he co-authored, Charter 08.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-dissident/chinas-top-dissident-arrested-for-subversion-idUSTRE55N0F020090624|title=China's top dissident arrested for subversion|last=|first=|date=2009-06-24|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-01-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electoral reform package ===
The Central Government unveiled a package of [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|electoral reforms]], calling for 10 new seats in the legislature from 60 to 70 of which 40 will be directly elected, the first time a majority of seats will be determined by popular vote. It also called for an extra 400 people to be added to the 800-member committee that nominates and elects the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hketolondon.gov.hk/news/docs/Final_10_APR.pdf|title=Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office|last=|first=|date=2010|work=Hong Kong Review|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill requires a vote of 40, or a two-thirds majority threshold to pass.  Hong Kong’s Legislative Council passed the bill on 25 June 2010 with 46 lawmakers, including moderates, in favor. 12 others, including members from the League of Social Democrats and all five members of the Civic Party, voted against it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/06/25/hongkong.politics/index.html|title=Hong Kong passes electoral reform - CNN.com|last=CNN|first=By  Elizabeth Yuan,|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents view that the bill does not go far enough and does not set any concrete roadmap for Hong Kong’s universal suffrage, leaving uncertainty. The [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pan-democracy camp]] attacked the conservative proposals as a rehash of those already rejected in 2005, but the Hong Kong government under Donald Tsang said its proposals were “more democratic”, and could not exceed what was authorized by Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Michael|date=February 2011|title=Prospects for Democracy in Hong Kong: The 2012 Election Reforms|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R40992.pdf|journal=CRS Report for Congress|volume=|pages=|via=Congressional Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pan-democratic party was split when The Democratic Party opted to vote with the Beijing government, parting company with the Civic Party and the League of Social Democrats. The Chief Executive assented on 29 June 2010, and China’s parliament ratified the decision on 28 August. It was the first time Hong Kong's legislature had passed major reforms to electoral arrangements since the city reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997. A previous attempt in 2005 was voted down by opposition democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-democracy/hong-kong-passes-historic-reforms-amid-muted-protest-idUSTRE65O0W920100625|title=Some see sell-out as Hong Kong passes electoral reforms|last=|first=|date=2010-06-25|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-01-29|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

=== Mainland reaction ===
Beijing was wary of upsurges of public discontent in Hong Kong. The Chinese government did not immediately comment after the resignation of five legislators, but it criticized the resignation plan in a statement afterwards, calling it a challenge to authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-censorship/china-blocks-bbc-website-as-hong-kong-tensions-rise-idUSKCN0I505S20141016|title=China blocks BBC website as Hong Kong tensions rise|last=|first=|date=2014-10-16|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-01-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1764">The '''All-National Congress of the Chechen People''' (NCChP) of the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] came to power on 1 November 1991 under president [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]], a former commander of the [[Soviet air force]] base in [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]]. Since its formation, the organization advocated [[sovereignty]] for [[Chechnya]] as a separate republic within the [[Soviet Union]]. During the period of Soviet breakup, it switched this to explicit support for the separation of "Ichkeria" from Russia. 

On 7 September 1991, the NCChP National Guard seized government buildings and the radio and television center. They stormed a session of the [[Chechen-Ingush ASSR]] [[Supreme Soviet]], which caused the death of the [[Soviet Communist Party]] chief for [[Grozny]], [[Vitali Kutsenko]], who was either thrown out of a window or fell trying to escape, and effectively dissolved the government of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chechen Wars: Will Russia Go the Way of the Soviet Union? by Matthew Evangelista'' Page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Russia's Chechen war by Tracey C. German'' Page 176&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1992 and 1994 and again from 1996 until 1999 Chechnya was ''de facto'' an [[Independence|independent]] [[Sovereign state|state]].

==Distribution==
Three thousand copies of the ''Almanac'' were distributed to academic and public libraries and 13,000 copies were sent to donors and U.S. foundations worth at least $50 million.

==Overview==
The ''Almanac of American Philanthropy'' chronicles 380 years of private giving in America. [[Jeff Jacoby (columnist)|Jeff Jacoby]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called the ''Almanac'' "the first definitive work on the history, variety, and impact of private giving in the United States."&lt;ref name=globe/&gt; Its sections include:

*An introduction that encapsulates philanthropy’s influence on American society, addresses common criticisms of philanthropy, and investigates the benefits of charitable giving&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zinsmeister|first1=Karl|title=Charitable Giving and the Fabric of America|url=http://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/charitable-giving-and-the-fabric-of-america/|accessdate=23 March 2016|work=Imprimis|publisher=Hillsdale College|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A list of the most significant U.S. living donors of the last 15 years
* A Hall of Fame of great historic donors
* Descriptive entries on more than 900 major achievements in American philanthropy from 1636 to 2015, organized by sectors
* Brief sketches of philanthropic literature, classic and recent, divided into themes
*A collection of quotations about giving
* The results of an original 2015 national poll of Americans on topics related to philanthropy. Among other findings, the poll found that 47 percent of Americans chose private charity as their first choice for solving a social problem, compared to 32 percent who chose government&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Charts and graphs with text explanations, depicting data and trends in philanthropy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In our opinion: Attempting to out-Christian others does not reflect well on the meaning and purpose of devotion|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865646691/In-our-opinion-Attempting-to-out-Christian-others-does-not-reflect-well-on-the-meaning-and-purpose.html?pg=all|accessdate=23 March 2016|publisher=Deseret News|date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cornely|first1=Tina|title=Mediating Our Future: A Road Map For Deconstructing Poverty|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tina-cornely/mediating-our-future-a-road-map-for-deconstructing-poverty_b_9144980.html|accessdate=23 March 2016|publisher=Huffington Post|date=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An analysis of which demographic and regional groups are America’s more generous givers.&lt;ref name=blue/&gt; According to the ''Almanac'', the wealthiest 1% of Americans make one-third of all charitable donations&lt;ref name=greedy/&gt;
* An analysis of the U.S. tax treatment of charitable donations
* A timeline of the most significant events in U.S. philanthropy over four centuries of national development

The ''[[Orange County Register]]'' wrote that the ''Almanac'' "shatters myths about the stinginess of the wealthy and bleeding-heart liberals’ monopoly on compassion."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  ''Booklist'', published by the American Library Association, reviewed the ''Almanac'' this way:  "This comprehensive, current, accurate, well-organized reference on private giving in the U.S. contains sections on our greatest givers, past and present, and major achievements from 1636 to 2015. The volume's very reasonable cost (for 1,300+ pages) enhances the reference value.... Recommended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amazon review page|asin=0986147451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
[[Karl Zinsmeister]] created the ''Almanac of American Philanthropy'' for the [[Philanthropy Roundtable]]. He has authored eleven books, including works on [[charter schools]] and [[public policy]] philanthropy, embedded reporting on the [[Iraq War]], and a [[Marvel Comics]] nonfiction graphic novel.

The '''Authentic Croatian Peasant Party''' ({{lang-hr|Autohtona hrvatska seljačka stranka}}) is a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] [[political party]] in [[Croatia]].

==History==

Authentic Croatian Peasant Party was founded in Zagreb on 14 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://cro-eu.com/galerija-fotografija/albums/userpics/10001/PolStranke2011_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; First party president was Jasenko Stipac.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.revizija.hr/izvjesca/2014/ps-2014/politicke-stranke/autohtona-hrvatska-seljacka-stranka-a-hss.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The party refers to the tradition of [[Stjepan Radić]]'s [[Croatian People's Peasant Party|HPSS]].

According to the Party's statute "it is in particular committed to the promotion of the interests of farmers, workers, and intelligence of the Croatian nation". Party's values are "honesty, faith, family, patriotism and labor."

Ahead of the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2015|2015 parliamentary election]] the party joined the ruling [[Centre politics|centre]] to [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] [[Kukuriku coalition]] led by the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]].

==Background==
[[Oregon Citizens Alliance]] (OCA), an organization that opposed LGBT rights, successfully backed the passage of a 1988 [[Oregon Ballot Measure 8 (1988)|ballot measure]] revoking the ban on sexual-orientation discrimination in the state's executive branch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3dEPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=do8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5659,5056098&amp;dq=oregon+measure+8 "Oregon goes Democratic!" ''Ellensburg Daily Record'', November 9, 1988], accessed June 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, when OCA proposed a [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)|ballot measure]] to prohibit the "encouragement" of homosexual lifestyles in public schools,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co.benton.or.us/admin/elections/documents/archives/1990s/e92g/e92g_svp.pdf Oregon Voters' Pamphlet, November 3, 1992] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928235731/http://www.co.benton.or.us/admin/elections/documents/archives/1990s/e92g/e92g_svp.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }}, p. 93, hosted at the [http://www.co.benton.or.us/admin/elections/19901999.php Benton County Elections Division website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918045630/http://www.co.benton.or.us/admin/elections/19901999.php |date=2011-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oregonians who supported LGBT rights raised over $2 million and were successful in defeating the measure. OCA continued to promote similar measures at the local level&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/01/us/voters-in-oregon-back-local-anti-gay-rules.html Timothy Egan, "Voters in Oregon Back Local Anti-Gay Rules," July 1, 1993], accessed June 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and promised another statewide ballot in 1994. In response activists pressured for a stable political organization and formed Support Our Communities-PAC (SOC-PAC) in 1993. The following year, SOC-PAC successfully organized the opposition to another OCA proposal, a [[Oregon Ballot Measure 13 (1994)|ballot measure]] to ban the recognition of homosexuals as a minority group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YGFWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1vADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4614,5614802&amp;dq=minority+status+and+child+protection&amp;hl=en "Oregon group unveils new anti-gay initiative," ''Spokesman-Review'', May 7, 1993], accessed June 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYU&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wagner.nyu.edu/leadership/tools/files/EthnographyBuildingAlliances.pdf |title= Building Alliances: An Ethnography of Collaboration Between Rural Organizing Project (ROP) and CAUSA in Oregon |publisher= [[Robert F.

===Advocacy===
Basic Rights Oregon held its first meetings in 1995 and became a 501(c)(4) organization in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=First Name |url=http://www.basicrights.org/about-us/our-history/ |title=Our History |publisher=Basic Rights Oregon |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Basic Rights launched the Fair Workplace Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Queer Heroes NW - June 30th, 2014 - Featured Hero:  Basic Rights Oregon|url = http://www.pdxqcenter.org/queer-heroes-nw-june-30th-2014-featured-hero-basic-rights-oregon/|website = Q Center|accessdate = 2015-12-21|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was designed to increase the number of employers voluntarily adopting nondiscrimination policies.

In 2002, Basic Rights Oregon endorsed Democratic candidate [[Bill Bradbury]] for election to the United States Senate, opposing the [[Human Rights Campaign]], a national LGBT rights organization, which endorsed the re-election of the Republican incumbent [[Gordon H. Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/20/us/campaign-season-the-awkward-endorsement-game.html? Todd S. Purnam, "Campaign Season; The Awkward Endorsement Game," October 20, 2001], accessed June 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Basic Rights Oregon, nine same-sex couples, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], and [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]] joined as plaintiffs against the State of Oregon, the [[governor of Oregon|Governor]], the [[Oregon Attorney General|Attorney General]], the Director of the [[Oregon Department of Human Services|Department of Human Services]], and the State Registrar in a suit, ''Li v. State'', in the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] seeking a declaration that the statutes (ORS chapter 106) prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying on the same terms as different-sex couples violated the Oregon Constitution.&lt;ref name=Bast&gt;{{cite book |title= Foundations of Law: Cases, Commentary and Ethics |first= Carol |last= M. Bast |author2=Ransford C. Pyle |publisher= [[Cengage Learning|Delmar]] |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-1-4354-4084-5 |location= Clinton Park, New Jersey |page= 177 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LOy55Are_ZcC&amp;pg=PA177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Basic Rights Oregon worked against [[Oregon Ballot Measure 36 (2004)|Ballot Measure 36]], which amended the [[Oregon Constitution]] to prohibit [[Same-sex marriage in Oregon|same-sex marriage]]. Although Basic Rights Oregon raised nearly $3 million to fight the measure, it passed with 57% in favor and 43% opposed. Following this loss, Basic Rights Oregon hired its first team of field organizers and pushed nondiscrimination ordinances in [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]], [[Bend, Oregon|Bend]], [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], and [[Wasco County, Oregon|Wasco County]].

In 2007, Basic Rights led the lobbying effort to pass the [[Oregon Equality Act]] and the [[Oregon Family Fairness Act]].

In 2012, following years of education and collaboration with Basic Rights Oregon, the state Insurance Division issued a bulletin banning many private insurers from selling discriminatory policies in Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregon.gov/DCBS/insurance/legal/bulletins/Documents/bulletin2012-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, in the wake of the [[Obergefell v. Hodges|Supreme Court ruling on Marriage Equality]], Basic Rights Oregon adopted a [http://www.basicrights.org/ new strategic direction] for 2015-2020. The new strategic direction seeks to center the voices of LGBTQ people of color, of rural and religious LGBTQ Oregonians, and of transgender and gender non-conforming Oregonians.

In 2015, Oregon became the third state to ban the discredited practice of [[Conversion therapy]] on minors. Basic Rights Oregon worked to pass HB2307, the Youth Mental Health Protection Act, which was signed into law by Gov. [[Kate Brown]], the nations only out Bi-sexual governor.

In 2017 Oregon passed HB 2673A - effective January 1, 2018 - simplifying the process for changing the name on a birth certificate, and also establishing a gender amendment process for transgender citizens. The revisions provide less expensive, more private and simpler transactions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.basicrights.org/news/oregons-remarkable-year-transgender-justice/ and Diane Goodwin, Basic Rights Oregon&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Motor Vehicles also changed its procedure for gender changes on IDs, allowing Oregonians to self-certify gender change without input from their health provider. Furthermore, effective July 1, 2017, the DMV made Oregon the first state in the country to recognize non-binary identities. The third marker on IDs is "X", for "not specified."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.basicrights.org/news/oregons-remarkable-year-transgender-justice/ and Diane Goodwin, Basic Rights Oregon&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 1, 2018, contractors working with the state of Oregon must have in place policies and practices which prohibit discrimination against their LGBTQ employees. The sponsor of the successful bill, HB 3060, was Rep. Ann Lininger. The measure also prevents state contractors from health care discrimination based on gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.basicrights.org/news/oregons-remarkable-year-transgender-justice/ and Diane Goodwin, Basic Rights Oregon&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calcium sulfate''' (or '''calcium sulphate''') is the inorganic compound with the formula CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and related [[hydrate]]s. In the form of γ-[[anhydrite]] (the [[anhydrous]] form), it is used as a [[desiccant]]. One particular [[hydrate]] is better known as [[plaster of Paris]], and another occurs naturally as the mineral [[gypsum]].  It has many uses in industry. All forms are white solids that are poorly soluble in water.&lt;ref name=Ullmanns&gt;Franz Wirsching "Calcium Sulfate" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2012 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a04_555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium sulfate causes permanent hardness in water.

==Hydration states and crystallographic structures==
The compound exists in three levels of hydration corresponding to different crystallographic structures and to different minerals in the nature:
* CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ([[anhydrite]]): anhydrous state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1107/S0567740875007145| title = Anhydrite: A refinement| journal = Acta Crystallographica Section B| volume = 31| issue = 8| pages = 2164| year = 1975| last1 = Morikawa| first1 = H.| last2 = Minato| first2 = I.| last3 = Tomita| first3 = T.| last4 = Iwai| first4 = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; · 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ([[gypsum]]): dihydrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1107/S0567740874004055| title = A refinement of the crystal structure of gypsum CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O| journal = Acta Crystallographica Section B| volume = 30| issue = 4| pages = 921| year = 1974| last1 = Cole| first1 = W.F.| last2 = Lancucki| first2 = C.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; · 0.5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ([[bassanite]]): hemihydrate, also known as [[plaster of Paris]]. Specific hemihydrates are sometimes distinguished: alpha-hemihydrate and beta-hemihydrate.&lt;ref name=t&gt;Taylor H.F.W. (1990) ''Cement Chemistry''. Academic Press, {{ISBN|0-12-683900-X}}, pp. 186-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The main use of calcium sulfate is to produce plaster of Paris and [[stucco]]. These applications exploit the fact that calcium sulfate which has been powdered and [[Calcination|calcined]] forms a moldable paste upon [[Mineral hydration|hydration]] and hardens as crystalline calcium sulfate dihydrate. It is also convenient that calcium sulfate is poorly [[Solubility|soluble]] in water and does not readily dissolve in contact with water after its solidification.

===Hydration and dehydration reactions===
With judicious heating, gypsum converts to the partially dehydrated mineral called calcium sulfate hemihydrate, calcined gypsum, and [[plaster of Paris]].This material has the formula CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·(''n''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), where  0.5 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 0.8.&lt;ref name=t/&gt; Temperatures between 100&amp;nbsp;°C and 150&amp;nbsp;°C (302&amp;nbsp;°F) are required to drive off the water within its structure. The details of the temperature and time depend on ambient humidity. Temperatures as high as 170&amp;nbsp;°C are used in industrial calcination, but at these temperatures γ-anhydrite begins to form.  The heat energy delivered to the gypsum at this time (the heat of hydration) tends to go into driving off water (as water vapor) rather than increasing the temperature of the mineral, which rises slowly until the water is gone, then increases more rapidly.  The equation for the partial dehydration is:

: CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; · 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; &amp;nbsp; CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; · 0.5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 1.5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;uarr;

The [[endothermic]] property of this reaction is relevant to the performance of [[drywall]], conferring fire resistance to residential and other structures. In a fire, the structure behind a sheet of drywall will remain relatively cool as water is lost from the gypsum, thus preventing (or substantially retarding) damage to the [[Framing (construction)|framing]] (through [[combustion]] of [[wood]] members or loss of strength of [[steel]] at high temperatures) and consequent structural collapse. But at higher temperatures, calcium sulfate will release oxygen and act as an [[oxidizing agent]]. This property is used in [[Aluminothermic reaction|aluminothermy]]. In contrast to most minerals, which when rehydrated simply form liquid or semi-liquid pastes, or remain powdery, calcined gypsum has an unusual property: when mixed with water at normal (ambient) temperatures, it quickly reverts chemically to the preferred dihydrate form, while physically "setting" to form a rigid and relatively strong gypsum crystal lattice:

:CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; · 0.5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 1.5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  &amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; &amp;nbsp; CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; · 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

This reaction is [[exothermic]] and is responsible for the ease with which gypsum can be cast into various shapes including sheets (for [[drywall]]), sticks (for blackboard chalk), and molds (to immobilize broken bones, or for metal casting). Mixed with polymers, it has been used as a bone repair cement. Small amounts of calcined gypsum are added to earth to create strong structures directly from [[cast earth]], an alternative to [[adobe]] (which loses its strength when wet). The conditions of dehydration can be changed to adjust the porosity of the hemihydrate, resulting in the so-called alpha and beta hemihydrates (which are more or less chemically identical).

On heating to 180&amp;nbsp;°C, the nearly water-free form, called γ-anhydrite (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·''n''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O where ''n'' = 0 to 0.05) is produced. γ-Anhydrite reacts slowly with water to return to the dihydrate state, a property exploited in some commercial [[desiccant]]s. On heating above 250&amp;nbsp;°C, the completely anhydrous form called β-anhydrite or "natural" [[anhydrite]] is formed. Natural anhydrite does not react with water, even over geological timescales, unless very finely ground.

The variable composition of the hemihydrate and γ-anhydrite, and their easy inter-conversion, is due to their nearly identical crystal structures containing "channels" that can accommodate variable amounts of water, or other small molecules such as [[methanol]].

===Other uses===
[[File:Drierite.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Drierite]]
The calcium sulfate hydrates are used as a [[flocculation|coagulant]] in products such as [[tofu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soymilkmaker.com/coagulant.html About tofu coagulant.]  Retrieved 9 Jan. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to the 1970s, commercial quantities of [[sulfuric acid]] were produced in [[Whitehaven]] ([[Cumbria]], UK) from anhydrous calcium sulfate. Upon being mixed with [[shale]] or [[marl]], and roasted, the sulfate liberates [[sulfur trioxide]] gas, a precursor in [[sulfuric acid]] production, the reaction also produces [[calcium silicate]], a mineral phase essential in [[cement]] [[Clinker (cement)|clinker]] production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lakestay.co.uk/whitehavenmininghistory.html Whitehaven Coast Archeological Survey]&lt;/ref&gt;

: CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; CaSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

When sold at the anhydrous state as a desiccant with a color-indicating agent under the name Drierite, it appears blue (anhydrous) or pink (hydrated) due to impregnation with [[cobalt(II) chloride]], which functions as a moisture indicator.

==Production and occurrence== 
The main sources of calcium sulfate are naturally occurring [[gypsum]] and [[anhydrite]], which occur at many locations worldwide as [[evaporite]]s. These may be extracted by open-cast quarrying or by deep mining. World production of natural gypsum is around 127 million tonnes per annum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/gypsum/mcs-2008-gypsu.pdf Gypsum], USGS, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to natural sources, calcium sulfate is produced as a by-product in a number of processes:
*In [[flue-gas desulfurization]], exhaust gases from [[fossil-fuel power station]]s and other processes (e.g. cement manufacture) are scrubbed to reduce their sulfur oxide content, by injecting finely ground [[limestone]] or [[calcium hydroxide|lime]]. This produces an impure [[calcium sulfite]], which oxidizes on storage to calcium sulfate.
*In the production of [[phosphoric acid]] from [[apatite|phosphate rock]], calcium phosphate is treated with sulfuric acid and calcium sulfate precipitates.
*In the production of [[hydrogen fluoride]], [[calcium fluoride]] is treated with sulfuric acid, precipitating calcium sulfate.
*In the refining of [[zinc]], solutions of [[zinc sulfate]] are treated with [[calcium hydroxide|lime]] to co-precipitate heavy metals such as [[barium]].
*Calcium sulfate can also be recovered and re-used from scrap drywall at construction sites.

These precipitation processes tend to concentrate radioactive elements in the calcium sulfate product. This issue is particular with the phosphate by-product, since phosphate ores naturally contain [[uranium]] and its [[decay product]]s such as [[radium-226]], [[lead-210]] and [[polonium-210]].

Calcium sulfate is also a common component of [[fouling]] deposits in industrial heat exchangers, because its solubility decreases with increasing temperature (see the specific section on the retrograde solubility).

===Mars===
2011 findings by the [[Opportunity (rover)|''Opportunity'']] rover on Mars show a form of calcium sulfate in a vein on the surface. Images suggest the mineral is [[gypsum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Mars Opportunity rover finds mineral vein deposited by water|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2011-377&amp;cid=release_2011-377&amp;msource=11377&amp;tr=y&amp;auid=9976954|publisher=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=April 23, 2013|date=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retrograde solubility==
The dissolution of the different crystalline phases of calcium sulfate in water is [[exothermic]] and release [[heat]] (decrease in [[Enthalpy]]: ΔH &lt; 0). As an immediate consequence, to proceed, the dissolution reaction needs to evacuate this heat that can be considered as a product of reaction. If the system is cooled, the dissolution equilibrium will evolve towards the right according to the [[Le Chatelier principle]] and calcium sulfate will dissolve more easily. The solubility of calcium sulfate increases thus when the temperature decreases. If the temperature of the system is raised, the reaction heat cannot dissipate and the equilibrium will regress towards the left according to Le Chatelier principle. The solubility of calcium sulfate decreases thus when temperature increases. This contra-intuitive solubility behaviour is called retrograde solubility. It is less common than for most of the salts whose dissolution reaction is [[endothermic]] (i.e., the reaction consumes heat: increase in [[Enthalpy]]: ΔH &gt; 0) and whose solubility increases with temperature. Another calcium compound, [[calcium hydroxide]] (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[portlandite]]) also exhibits a retrograde solubility for the same thermodynamic reason: because its dissolution reaction is also exothermic and releases heat. So, to dissolve higher amounts of calcium sulfate or calcium hydroxide in water, it is necessary to cool down the solution close to its freezing point instead of increasing its temperature.

[[File:Temperature dependence calcium sulfate solubility.svg|thumb|400px|left|Temperature dependence of the solubility of calcium sulfate (3 phases) in pure water.]]{{clear-left}}

The retrograde solubility of calcium sulfate is also responsible for its precipitation in the hottest zone of heating systems and for its contribution to the formation of [[Fouling#Precipitation fouling|scale]] in [[boiler]]s along with the precipitation of [[calcium carbonate]] whose [[solubility]] also decreases when [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] degasses from hot water or can escape out of the system.

The '''Chancellor of Florence''' held the most important position in the bureaucracy of the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine Republic]]. Though the chancellor was not officially a member of the Republic's elected political government, unlike the [[gonfaloniere]] or the nine members of the [[signoria]], the role was roughly equivalent to the head of the civil service in some countries today, and its hilder could still wield considerable political influence. Holders included some of the most famous scholars, political thinkers and humanists of the Renaissance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18928">A '''client state''' is a state that is economically, politically, or militarily subordinate to another more powerful state (termed controlling state in this article) in international affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Graham Fry, Erik Goldstein, Richard Langhorne. ''Guide to International Relations and Diplomacy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Continuum International Publishing, 2002. Pp. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Types of client states include: [[satellite state]], [[associated state]], [[puppet state]], [[neo-colony]], [[protectorate]], [[vassal state]], and [[tributary state]].

==Controlling states in history==

===Persia, Greece, and Rome===
{{see also|List of Roman client kings}}
{{see also|List of Roman client queens}}
Ancient states such as [[Persia]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek city-states]] would create client states by making the leaders of that state subservient. [[Classical Athens]], for example, forced weaker states into the [[Delian League]] and in some cases imposed democratic government on them. Later, [[Philip II of Macedon]] similarly imposed the [[League of Corinth]]. One of the most prolific users of client states was [[Roman Republic|Republican Rome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmmBAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=client+king&amp;dq=client+king&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1980&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;hl=el&amp;cd=5|title=Herod's Judaea|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collected studies: Alexander and his successors in Macedonia, by Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière Hammond,1994,page 257,"to Demetrius of Pharos, whom she set up as a client king&lt;/ref&gt; which, instead of conquering and then absorbing into an empire, chose to make client states out of those it defeated (e.g. [[Demetrius of Pharos]]), a policy which was continued up until the 1st century BCE when it became the [[Roman Empire]]. Sometimes the client was not a former enemy but a [[pretender]] whom Rome helped, [[Herod the Great]] being a well-known example. The use of client states continued through the [[Middle Ages]] as the [[feudal system]] began to take hold.

===Under the Mongols and the Yuan dynasty===
In the 13th century, [[Goryeo]] dynasty of [[Korea]] was overrun by the [[Mongols]] who founded the powerful [[Mongol Empire]]. After the peace treaty in 1260 and the [[Sambyeolcho Rebellion]] in 1270, Goryeo became a [[Korea under Yuan rule|semi-autonomous]] client state of the [[Yuan dynasty]] for about 80 years.

===Ottoman Empire===

==19th and 20th centuries==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}
===Russia and Serbia===
{{main|Russia–Serbia relations}}
The [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] tried to make Serbia a client state in order to form a Christian opposition to the Ottoman Empire. That changed after a revolution in Serbia in 1900. Serbia now came under Russian protection, which was forming a pan-Orthodox opposition to the Latin Christianity represented by the Austria-Hungarian empire. In 1914, Russia repeatedly warned the Austro-Hungarian Empire against attacking Serbia. When it did attack, Russia mobilized its army.&lt;ref&gt;Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Sazonov]] warned Austria in 1914 that Russia "Would respond militarily to any action against the client state." Christopher Clark, ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' (2012) p 481.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas F. X.

Great Britain and Austria both considered Serbia as a client state controlled by Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Cowper|title=World War One and Its Consequences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l9VmAAAAMAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Open University Press|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians call Serbia a client state but historian Christopher Clark disagrees. He says the Russians made a mistake in thinking Serbia was a client state. In an unpublished commentary Clark argues: "It was a risk enhancing initiative [of Russian Foreign Minister Serge Sazanov] to see Serbia as a kind of client...Serbia to my knowledge, has never been a client of anyone. This is a mistake, when Great Powers think they can secure the services of "client states". That "clients" are never in fact "clients". But this is a mistake that is presumably going to be keep being made by our political leaderships, though one hopes one day it will stop."&lt;ref&gt;CIRSD Conference on WWI: Panel "What Kind of Failure?" - Prof. Christopher Clark, 21:48. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV2147p9xho Published on 30 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
{{main article|French client republic}}
{{main article|Françafrique}}

During the French Revolution and Napoleonic eras, France conquered most of [[western Europe]] and established several client states.
At first, during the [[French revolutionary wars]] these states were erected as republics (the so-called "Républiques soeurs", or "sister republics"). They were established in Italy ([[Cisalpine Republic]] in [[Northern Italy]], [[Parthenopean Republic]] in [[Southern Italy]]), [[Helvetic Republic|Switzerland]], Belgium, and [[Batavian Republic|the Netherlands as a republic]] and [[Kingdom of Holland|a monarchy]].

During the [[First French Empire]], while [[Napoleon]] and the French army conquered [[Europe]], such states changed, and several new states were formed. The Italian republics were transformed into the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] under Napoleon's direct rule in the north and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] in the south, under [[Joseph Bonaparte]]'s rule and later under Marshal of the Empire [[Joachim Murat]]'s rule.

The west bank of the river [[Rhine]] was annexed and was a part of the French Empire. Numerous German states, comprising the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], were client states of the French Empire, including the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], which was controlled by [[Jerome Bonaparte]].

[[Spain]], too, was a client kingdom, following the [[Peninsular War|French invasion of the Iberian Peninsula]]; as was Poland, then the [[Duchy of Warsaw]].

In the 20th century, France started to apply the concept of [[Françafrique]], its name for its [[List of French possessions and colonies#In Africa|former African colonies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/specialseries/2013/08/201387113131914906.html |title=The French African Connection |access-date=September 27, 2018 |last= |first= |date=April 7, 2014 |work= |publisher=Al Jazeera |location= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/opinion/global/the-return-of-francafrique.html |title=The Return of Françafrique |access-date=September 27, 2018 |last=Haski |first=Pierre |date=July 21, 2013 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |location=New York |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes extended to the former Belgian colonies. At present the term is used on some occasions to criticise the allegedly neocolonial relationship France has with its former colonies in Africa.

The countries involved provide oil and minerals important to the French economy. In addition, French companies have commercial interests in several countries of the continent. As if that were not enough, Francophone countries in Africa help to sustain the image of France as a world power, by giving votes of support for French initiatives at the [[United Nations|UN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loonwatch.com/2014/03/25/bleeding-africa-a-half-century-of-the-francafrique/ |title=Bleeding Africa: A Half Century of the Françafrique |access-date=September 27, 2018 |last= |first= |date=March 25, 2014 |work= |publisher=Loonwatch.com |location= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Empire===
In the [[British Empire]] the [[Indian Princely States]] were technically independent and were technically given their separate independence in 1947 (although the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] indeed opted for independence but could not retain his independence from India). [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|Egyptian Independence]] in 1922 technically ended a British protectorate in Egypt. Sudan continued to be governed as [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] until Sudanese independence in 1956; Britain also had an interest in Egypt until the [[Suez Crisis]] was over. [[Iraq#Hashemite monarchy|Iraq]] was made a kingdom in 1932. In each case the economic and military reality did not amount to full independence, but a status where the local rulers were British clients. Similarly in Africa (e.g. Northern Nigeria under [[Lord Lugard]]), and Malaya with the [[Federated Malay States]] and [[Unfederated Malay States]]; the policy of ''[[indirect rule]]''.

===Germany===
After [[France]] was defeated in the [[Battle of France]], [[Vichy France]] was established as a client state of Nazi Germany, which remained as such until 1942 when it was reduced to a [[puppet government]] until its liberation in 1944. Germany also established, in its newly conquered Eastern territories, client states including the [[Slovak Republic (1939–45)|Slovak Republic]], the [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatian State]] and the [[Government of National Salvation|Serbian State]].

===United States===
After 1945 the term "client state" often characterised countries ruled by dictatorships backed openly by either the United States or by the Soviet Union. During the [[Cold War]] of 1945-1992, many Latin American countries such as [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]] (until 1979), [[Republic of Cuba (1902-1959)|Cuba]] (until 1959), and [[Chile]] (under the regime of General [[Augusto Pinochet]] between 1973 and 1990) were seen{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} as U.S. client states, as the U.S. government had significant influence over the policies of those dictatorships. The term also applied to other authoritarian regimes with close ties to the United States during the Cold War, more appropriately referred to as U.S. proxy states, such as [[South Vietnam]], [[Indonesia]] (1966-1998) under the [[Suharto]] Regime, [[Imperial State of Iran|Iran]] until 1979, [[Khmer Republic|Cambodia]] under the regime of [[Lon Nol]] from 1970 to 1975, the [[Fourth Philippine Republic|Philippines]] under [[Ferdinand Marcos]] from 1965 to 1986, and [[Saudi Arabia]]. U.S. - Iran relations under [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi | the Shah]] (reigned 1941 to 1979) have been cited{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} as a modern [[political science | political-science]] case-study.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term might also arguably be used for those states extremely economically dependent on a more powerful nation. The three Pacific Ocean countries associated with the United States under the [[Compact of Free Association]] (the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Marshall Islands]] and [[Palau]]) may fall somewhat{{quantify|date=September 2018}} in this category.

===Japan===
In the late 19th century, the [[Japanese Empire]] reduced [[Korea]]'s status to that of a client state. In the early 20th century, this was converted to direct rule. [[Manchukuo]], in contrast, remained a puppet state throughout World War II.

===Soviet Union===
Soviet proxy or "client" states included much of the [[Warsaw Pact]] nations whose policies were heavily influenced by Soviet military power and economic aid. Other third world nations with [[Marxist-Leninist]] governments were routinely criticized as being Soviet proxies as well, among them Cuba following the [[Cuban Revolution]], the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]],&lt;ref name=DPRK&gt;{{cite news| url=http://theweek.com/articles/597768/why-north-korea-betting-big-nuclear-weapons |title=Why North Korea is betting big on nuclear weapons| date=8 January 2016| last=Mizokami| first=Kyle| publisher=The Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[People's Republic of Angola]], the [[People's Republic of Mozambique]], the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]], and the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] ([[North Vietnam]]). Within the [[Soviet Union]] itself, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] and the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]], had seats at the [[United Nations]], but were actually proper Soviet territory.

===Australia===
Some sources regard the tiny Pacific Island state of [[Nauru]] as a client state of [[Australia]], as it is heavily dependent on economic support from Australia, uses Australia's currency and processes and houses unauthorised asylum seeker arrivals to Australia under the [[Pacific Solution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/201759087/pacific-correspondent-mike-field|title=Pacific correspondent Mike Field|date=18 June 2015|work=Radio New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2015/10/31/chris-kenny-visits-nauru-borders-open-allies/14462100002570|title=Chris Kenny visits Nauru as borders open up to allies|work=The Saturday Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=onAAlO6qkiIC&amp;pg=PA348&amp;lpg=PA348&amp;dq=nauru+client+state&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IU7JnBTpVQ&amp;sig=F_NGLONOaYNq-GlloeS39hce4WU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY87Xyns3JAhXnnaYKHRk5BUMQ6AEISjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=nauru%20client%20state&amp;f=false|title=The Lonely Planet Story|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Ben Doherty wrote that "Nauru is a client state in every sense, kept functioning, just, by its wealthy neighbour.

[[File:Community Accountability.png|thumb|Community Accountability model]]
'''Community Accountability''' is
a community-based strategy, rather than a police/prison-based strategy, to address violence including [[domestic violence]], [[sexual violence]], and [[child abuse]].
Community Accountability is a process in which a community – a group of friends, a family, a church, a workplace, an apartment complex, a neighborhood, etc. – work together to do the following things:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="952">'''Cost-effective minimum water network''' is a holistic framework for [[water conservation]] which considers all conceivable methods to save water based on the [[water management hierarchy]].  

This framework, which is applicable for industrial as well as urban systems was first developed by Wan Alwi and Manan.&lt;ref&gt;Wan Alwi, S. R. and Manan, Z. A. (2007). A new holistic framework for cost effective minimum water network in industrial and urban sector. Journal of Environmental Management. 46, 5968–76.&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework is applicable for grassroots design and retrofit of water systems and ensures that a desired payback period for design of a water recovery system is satisfied using the [[systematic hierarchical approach for resilient process screening (SHARPS)]] technique.

'''Disabled People Against Cuts (DPAC''') is an organisation based in the [[United Kingdom]] for [[disabled people]] and allies to campaign against the impact of government spending cuts on the lives of disabled people.  Formed on 3 October 2010 DPAC promotes full human rights and equality for all disabled people, and operates from the Social Model of Disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams-Findlay|first=Robert|title=Lifting the lid on Disabled People Against Cuts|journal=Disability and Society|date=June 2011|volume=26|issue=6|page=774|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09687599.2011.602868#.Unaz6hDcpRI|accessdate=3 November 2013|doi=10.1080/09687599.2011.602868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview: Disabled People Against the Cuts (DPAC)|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/interview-disabled-people-against-the-cuts-dpac/|accessdate=20 October 2013|newspaper=Red Pepper|date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The 'Disabled People Protest' demonstration took place outside the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] annual conference on 3 October 2010 in the pouring rain in Birmingham, England. This was the first mass protest against the impact of austerity cuts to disabled people. It was also entirely led by disabled people, speaking out on their own behalf for themselves.  Using this march as a catalyst, leading activists founded the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pring|first=John|title=Spending Cuts Protest Sparks Birth of New Campaign|url=http://disabilitynewsservice.com/2010/10/spending-cuts-protest-sparks-birth-of-new-campaign/|publisher=Disability News Service|accessdate=3 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232845/http://disabilitynewsservice.com/2010/10/spending-cuts-protest-sparks-birth-of-new-campaign/|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://socialistworker.co.uk/art/22584/Disabled+People+Against+Cuts+launched|title=Disabled People Against Cuts launched|work=Socialist Worker (Britain)|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

DPAC is a non-hierarchical organisation which grew organically from a small group of people who came together to plan an anti-cuts march in [[Birmingham]]. The current steering group was elected at the 2011 conference.&lt;ref name="dpac"&gt;{{cite web|title=About DPAC|url=http://dpac.uk.net/about/|publisher=DPAC|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 26 local DPAC groups, each one of which works within the DPAC constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DPAC constitution|url=http://dpac.uk.net/2012/11/dpac-constitution-again-for-the-use-of-setting-up-local-groups/|publisher=DPAC|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are generally autonomous and their members make decisions for those groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of local groups|url=http://dpac.uk.net/contact-details-for-local-dpac-groups/|publisher=DPAC|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DPAC currently has a formal membership of 1,500, with 2,500 members of the Facebook page and 4,500 followers on Twitter. Online activism has had a key role to play in the development of the group. While other groups were organising entirely on line, or alternatively making little use of new social media, DPAC developed an approach that enabled both approaches side by side which enabled greater numbers to take part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Media, Political Participation and Empowerment|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|pages=180–181|author=Trevisan, Filippo|authorlink=Disabled People, Digital Campaigns and Contentious Politics: upload successful, or connection failed?|editor1=Scullion, R |editor2=Gerodimos, D |editor3=Jackson, D |editor4=Lilliker, D |chapter=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affiliations ===

DPAC is closely affiliated with its sister organisation Black Triangle in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Triangle|url=http://blacktrianglecampaign.org/|publisher=Black Triangle|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

DPAC operate from the [[Social model of disability]] which sees disability as being created by the structures of society not the medical differences in a persons body. A very simple example of this is where a wheelchair user won't say that they can not get up the steps into the public building because they have a specific medical condition that prevents them from walking, rather, they are disabled by the lack of access ramps. Economic, political and cultural forces exclude those of us with impairments and long term health conditions from full participation in society, limiting our educational, social, political, economic, health and cultural potential, well-being and participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oliver|first=Mike|title=The Social Model of Disability: 30 years on|journal=Disability and Society|year=2013|volume=28|issue=7|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687599.2013.818773#.UnaXxxDcpRI|accessdate=3 November 2013|doi=10.1080/09687599.2013.818773}}&lt;/ref&gt; DPAC supports full citizenship for all Disabled People and opposes all cutbacks and austerity measures which are currently hitting Disabled People 9 times harder than non-disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefit cuts hitting disabled people hardest|url=http://www.poverty.ac.uk/report-disability-government-cuts-benefits/benefit-cuts-%E2%80%98hitting-disabled-people-hardest%E2%80%99|publisher=PSE|accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

DPAC oppose all austerity measures which are currently heavily impacting disabled people in the UK. These include the closure of the Independent Living Fund, [[Personal Independence Payment]] (replacing Disability Living Allowance), [[Employment and Support Allowance]], the Children and Families Bill 2013 and the '[[Under-occupancy penalty|Bedroom tax]]'.

== Actions ==

Ellen Clifford, of DPAC, explained the tactics used by the anti-cuts group in the Guardian, saying "No one who cares about social justice can work with a government that is intent on dismantling the welfare state, so disabled activists are having to find other means to try to stop what is happening. Legal challenges to reforms are one part of that... But legal challenges aren't an answer in themselves, and, as a form of campaigning, need to be run alongside other forms of awareness-raising, lobbying, protests and direct action. We need the 99% to stand up and say "We will not let this happen''''"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disability Benefits Welfare Reform Cuts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/apr/02/disability-benefit-welfare-reforms-cuts|accessdate=7 September 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Week of Action ===

In 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2017 have held a 'Week of Action' to highlight the impact of austerity and the cuts on disabled peoples lives.
'''The Atos Games'''
From Monday 27 August 2012 DPAC hosted a week of 'The Atos Games' which focused on highlighting the hypocrisy of the sponsorship of the [[Paralympic games]] by Atos – the same company that carries out the highly controversial [[Work Capability Assessment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braye|first=Stuart |author2=Gibbons, Tom |author3=Dixon, Kevin|title=Disability 'Rights' or 'Wrongs'?

On the 30th August, campaigners staging a "die in" in Cardiff brought traffic to a standstill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/disabled-people-against-cuts-stage-2026648|title=Disabled People Against Cuts stage demo against Paralympics sponsor|last=McCarthy|first=James|date=2012-08-30|work=walesonline|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the closing day of the event, a demonstration outside Atos head offices moved to the offices of the [[Department of Work and Pensions]] (DWP) where protestors chained themselves to the main entrance.

The week included a direct action outside the [[BBC]] to highlight biased representation of disabled people and promotion of 'scrounger rhetoric' and culminated on a march on parliament during which the UK Disabled Peoples Manifesto was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pepper|first=Penny|title=Why I am lobbying Parliament|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/04/lobbying-parliament-disabled-rights|accessdate=7 September 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 September}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 Week Of Action was held to coincide with the [[Paralympic Games]] in London in September. Events included a pop-up guerilla art installation at Tate Modern, London, and the closing of Westminster Bridge by activists.

The 2017 Week of Action, in August, included support for [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers|RMT]] action to keep guards on trains, a protest outside ATOS HQ, and the blocking of the main entrance to The House of Commons Chamber.

==History==

===Formation===
Following the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European parliament elections]], the [[Independence/Democracy]] (IND/DEM) and [[Union for a Europe of Nations]] (UEN), two [[political groups of the European Parliament]], were in trouble. The [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) component of IND/DEM had done well, but the other parties of this group fared very poorly.&lt;ref name="EUO28394"/&gt; UEN had also lost MEPs and both groups had fallen under the threshold required for a group to exist.&lt;ref name="Rule3020090701"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20090714+RULE-030+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN&amp;navigationBar=YES|title=Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, 7th parliamentary term – July 2009, Rule 30: Formation of political groups|author=|date=1 July 2009|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rule2920090406"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20090309+RULE-029+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;navigationBar=YES|title=Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, 16th edition – March 2009, Rule 29: Formation of political groups|author=|date=6 April 2009|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remnants of both groups needed to find a new group before the constitutive session of the [[Seventh European Parliament|7th European Parliament]] on 14 July 2009.

Speculation regarding the new group surfaced on 30 June 2009. The name of the group was originally speculated as ''A Europe of Free Peoples'',&lt;ref name="EUO28394"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IL28922"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsussidiario.net/articolo.aspx?articolo=28922|title="UE/ Lega Nord nel nuovo gruppo di destra euroscettica"], 30 June 2009, from http://www.ilsussidiario.net/, English translation here [https://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&amp;hl=en&amp;js=n&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ilsussidiario.net%2Farticolo.aspx%3Farticolo%3D28922&amp;sl=it&amp;tl=en&amp;history_state0=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''A Europe of Peoples for Liberty'',&lt;ref name="EUO28394"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IL28922"/&gt; or a phrase involving the word ''Independence''&lt;ref name="EUO28394"/&gt; or ''Freedom''&lt;ref name="ND6432"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nd.se/ni/visa/default.asp?notisID=6432|title="EU-kritisk grupp i EU"], 30 June 2009, from http://www.nd.se/, English translation here [https://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&amp;hl=en&amp;js=n&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nd.se%2Fni%2Fvisa%2Fdefault.asp%3FnotisID%3D6432&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;history_state0=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Democracy''&lt;ref name="ND6432"/&gt; or ''People''.&lt;ref name="EUO28394"/&gt; In the absence of an official name, the nascent group was given the [[placeholder name]] of ''Liberty''.&lt;ref name="EUO28394"/&gt; On 1 July 2009 a press conference was held launching the group.&lt;ref name="EUO28403"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCN8129312"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ID556"&gt;[http://indemgroup.eu/32/news/556/?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=1&amp;cHash=913b16272c "EU-Critical Group in European Parliament launches"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907202723/http://indemgroup.eu/32/news/556/?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=1&amp;cHash=913b16272c |date=7 September 2009 }}, 1 July 2009, from [http://indemgroup.eu http://indemgroup.eu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302145232/http://indemgroup.eu/ |date=2 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That press conference named the group ''Europe of Freedom and Democracy''.&lt;ref name="EUO28403"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCN8129312"/&gt;

[[Andreas Mölzer]], the leader of the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ) European Parliament list, announced in July 2009 that FPÖ and EFD were in negotiations over FPÖ joining the group; each side had reservations about the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=EU-Rechtsaußen-Fraktion hat Vorbehalte gegen FPÖ |author= |url=http://derstandard.at/1246541337835/EU-Rechtsaussen-Fraktion-hat-Vorbehalte-gegen-FPOe |newspaper=[[Der Standard]] |date=3 July 2009 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with UKIP, the [[Reformed Political Party]] (SGP) of the Netherlands, and the [[Slovak National Party]] (SNS) each uneasy about the inclusion of the FPÖ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FPÖ dürfte nicht in Rechtsaußenfraktion landen |author= |url=http://derstandard.at/1246541678390/EU-Parlament-FPOe-duerfte-nicht-in-Rechtsaussenfraktion-landen |newspaper=[[Der Standard]] |date=8 July 2009 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, the FPÖ tried again to have its two MEPs join the faction, but was again denied, being opposed by five or six of the nine parties in the EFD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=EFD-Fraktion: Veto gegen FPÖ-Aufnahme |author= |url=http://derstandard.at/1304554170753/EU-Parlament-EFD-Fraktion-Veto-gegen-FPOe-Aufnahme |newspaper=[[Der Standard]] |date=10 June 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defections===
In March 2010 it was announced that MEP [[Nikki Sinclaire]] had had the UKIP whip withdrawn.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/8550698.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rebel Euro MP is expelled by UKIP | date=4 March 2010 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclaire had refused to join the EFD on the grounds that it was a grouping with "extreme views" and consequently had not sat with her UKIP colleagues in the European parliament.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; In June 2010 MEP [[Mike Nattrass]] also left the EFD, albeit on other grounds than Sinclaire, stating that "I don't share the same principles of some of the Group, on balance, the majority of the Group want to stay in the EU and I've always believed that we should leave." Nattrass later rejoined the group in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neurope.eu/articles/101621.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xJ7YR6Wx?url=http://www.neurope.eu/articles/101621.php |archivedate=19 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011 MEP [[Trevor Colman]] left the EFD, allegedly due to an "unresolved dispute over financial and staffing issues." However Colman continued to represent UKIP as a [[Non-Inscrits|Non-Attached MEP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colman Quits EFD|url=http://www.eureporter.co/2011/3/colman-quits-efd/|accessdate=16 June 2012|newspaper=EU Reported|date=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike NATTRASS|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28506/Mike_NATTRASS.html|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May 2011, British MEP [[David Campbell Bannerman]] defected to the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative Party]], and the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] (ECR) group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13518731 | work=BBC News | title=UKIP MEP Campbell Bannerman defects to Conservatives | date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Danish MEP [[Anna Rosbach]] left the EFD, and in turn joined the ECR group as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparliament.com/latest-news/article/newsarticle/rosbach-leaves-danish-peoples-party-to-become-ecr-mep/ Rosbach leaves Danish People's Party to become ECR MEP: theparliament.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313085011/http://www.theparliament.com/latest-news/article/newsarticle/rosbach-leaves-danish-peoples-party-to-become-ecr-mep |date=13 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFD was joined by Belgian MEP [[Frank Vanhecke]] in November 2011, after Vanhecke left [[Vlaams Belang|Flemish Interest]] (VB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gewezen VB-voorzitter Vanhecke: "Stem op N-VA" |author= |url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/989/Binnenland/article/detail/1348938/2011/11/16/Gewezen-VB-voorzitter-Vanhecke-Stem-op-N-VA.dhtml |newspaper=[[De Morgen]] |date=16 November 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was joined by [[Magdi Allam]] in December 2011, when Allam defected from the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] (UDC) in the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Contrario alla libertà di coscienza sull’aborto, Magdi Allam esce dal PPE |first=Mara |last=Piras |url=http://www.italiah24.it/italia/politica/84100/contrario-alla-liberta-di-coscienza-sullaborto-magdi-allam-esce-dal-ppe.html |newspaper= |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four MEPs from [[United Poland]] defected from the ECR group on 26 December 2011, taking the group's numbers to 33. In March 2012 [[Roger Helmer]] who was elected as a British Conservative Party MEP and previously sat with the ECR group, defected to UKIP and the EFD, raising the group's numbers to 34.&lt;ref name="34-meps"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hinton-Beales|first=Desmond|title=Conservative MEP defects to UKIP|url=http://www.theparliament.com/latest-news/article/newsarticle/conservative-mep-defects-to-ukip/|accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=TheParliament.com|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2012, [[Slavcho Binev]] MEP of [[People for Real, Open and United Democracy]] (PROUD) joined the group.

In February 2013 Marta Andreasen announced she was leaving UKIP and defected to the Conservative Party.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In late September 2013, [[National Front for the Salvation of Bulgaria]] (NSFB) joined the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skat.bg/products.php?type=10&amp;genre=2539|title=Национална телевизия СКАТ|author=Национална телевизия СКАТ|date=|work=skat.bg|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Flag of FLAMA.svg|thumb|FLAMA's flag - very similar in design to what would become the [[Flag of Madeira]].]]
The '''Frente de Libertação do Arquipélago da Madeira''' ({{Lang-en|Madeira Archipelago Liberation Front}}), or '''FLAMA''' (which could be read as an archaic Portuguese word for "flame", ''flama''), was a [[right-wing]] [[Terrorism|terrorist]] [[paramilitary]] organisation from [[Madeira]], whose main goal was to achieve Madeira's independence from [[mainland Portugal|mainland]] [[Portugal]].

== History ==
FLAMA carried out around 200 bomb attacks between 1974-1976&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publico.pt/Pol%C3%ADtica/fundadores-da-flama-asseguram-que-o-ressuscitar-do-movimento-separatista-so-interessa-a-jardim_1378261|title=Fundadores da FLAMA Asseguram que o Ressuscitar do Movimento Separatista Só Interessa a Jardim|last=|first=|date=|website=Alberto Joao Jardim, Gabriel Drumond, Daniel Drumond e Jaime Ramos foram terroristas da FLAMA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, during the revolutionary period that followed the Portuguese [[Carnation Revolution]] (April 25, 1974). The Carnation Revolution effectively changed the Portuguese regime from an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[dictatorship]] (the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]) to a [[democracy]] (the [[Portuguese Third Republic|Third Republic]]), but only after two years of a transitional period known as [[PREC]] (''Processo Revolucionário Em Curso'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''Ongoing Revolutionary Process''), characterized by social turmoil and power dispute between left and right wing political forces. During this period the new government withdrew from [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], the last Portuguese colonies on mainland Africa. Some in Madeira thought that their area should be the next to separate.&lt;ref name="Minahan2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Minahan|title=Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: L-R|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9Lq_8Ozf5cC&amp;pg=PA1135|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32111-5|pages=1135–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FLAMA's demands were more a right-wing political reaction by some of the regional elites to the [[left-wing]] nature of the Revolution and its main actors, than a truly [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or [[Nationalism|nationalist]] [[Separatism|separatist]] goal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dnoticias.pt/hemeroteca/190167-bandeiras-da-flama-tem-dedo-de-pessoas-que-ocupam-cargos-muito-altos-na-ACDN190167|title=Bandeiras da FLAMA “têm dedo de pessoas que ocupam cargos muito altos na Região”|work=www.dnoticias.pt|access-date=2018-12-01|language=pt-PT}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The group is thought to have been made up of young, anti-communist students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtp.pt/play/p2560/e250760/umahistoriadeautonomia|title=Uma História de Autonomia - Episódio 12 -   RTP Play - RTP|work=RTP Play|access-date=2018-12-02|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A similar group in the [[Azores|Azores Archipelago]], called [[Frente de Libertação dos Açores]], established contact in October 1975. After the normalization of the [[Politics of Portugal|Portuguese political system]], early in 1976, and the [[Constitution of Portugal|constitutional grant]] of [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|autonomy to the Portuguese North Atlantic archipelagos]] of Madeira and [[Azores]], the organization slowed down. However, the end of the organization is thought to have taken place in 1978, which was confirmed by one of its most prominent members Daniel Drumont, "The movement ended in 1978, (...) when Portugal was walking towards a communist dictatorship, but now it’s extinct"&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dnoticias.pt/hemeroteca/190167-bandeiras-da-flama-tem-dedo-de-pessoas-que-ocupam-cargos-muito-altos-na-ACDN190167|title=Bandeiras da FLAMA “têm dedo de pessoas que ocupam cargos muito altos na Região”|work=www.dnoticias.pt|access-date=2018-12-01|language=pt-PT}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
== Flag ==
The FLAMA flag is composed of a blue-yellow-blue vertical triband, and in the yellow sections there are five small shields. The blue represents the environment that characterizes the island and represents nobility and serenity. The yellow mirrors the climate of the Archipelago, a symbol of richness, strength, faith and purity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alram.pt/regiao/hist%C3%B3ria/breve-hist%C3%B3ria-da-madeira/140-sem-categoria/1518-simbolos-da-autonomia.html|title=Símbolos da Autonomia|last=Sousa|first=Cristina|website=www.alram.pt|language=pt-br|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The five shields, which are also present in the [[Flag of Portugal|Portuguese flag]] stand for the [[Five Holy Wounds|five wounds of Christ]] (Portuguese: [[:pt:Estigma_(fenômeno)|Cinco Chagas de Cristo]]) when crucified, and are typically associated with the legend in which Count Afonso Henriques (future Afonso I) "killed the five [[Moors|Moorish]] kings of the Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, Évora and Beja [[taifas]]. Hence, in gratitude to Jesus, he incorporated five shields arranged in a cross—representing his divine-led victory over the five enemy kings—with each one carrying Christ's [[Stigmata|five wounds]] in the form of silver bezants. The sum of all bezants (doubling the ones in the central shield) would give thirty, symbolizing [[Judas Iscariot|Judas Iscarot]]'s [[thirty pieces of silver]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Flag of Portugal|date=2018-08-07|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_of_Portugal&amp;oldid=853866325|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The flag was first raised on the 20th of July 1975, in FLAMA's first high-profile act.

== Main Events ==
On the 20th of July 1975, FLAMA's first high-profile action took place when several walls in [[Funchal]], Madeira's main city, were sprayed with phrases and expressions such as "Independence for Madeira" and "Out With The Portuguese", which FLAMA's signature at the bottom&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtp.pt/play/p2560/e246961/umahistoriadeautonomia|title=Uma História de Autonomia - Episódio 7 -   RTP Play - RTP|work=RTP Play|access-date=2018-12-02|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One of the common expressions in the [[graffiti]] that became FLAMA's signature action, was the expression "[[Cubans]]" to describe the mainland Portuguese. This came from the fact that [[Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho]], a well-known Portuguese military officer and main strategist of the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]], was an admirer of [[Fidel Castro]]'s communist policies in Cuba.

In the beginning of August 1975, FLAMA releases several statements in which it promises violent acts in case no action no action is taken to start the process of independence. The expression "Friday, it's João's birthday" (form the Portuguese: Sexta-feira, o João faz anos"), which was supposed to be a code for violent acts that were going to be taken. As a response, Madeira's military forces launched operation "Happy Birthday" (from the Portuguese: ''parabéns''), in which 200 military officers and police officers are given orders to find the group. At 2:45am of the 9th of August, a Saturday, a bomb attack is perpetrated and its target is the national news station, [[Radio and Television of Portugal|Emissora Nacional]]. The attackers made use of 200 [[Gram|grams]] of [[dynamite]], but the attack did not cause much damage and was intended to serve as a warning&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

On the 23rd of August, FLAMA strikes once again Emissora Nacional, and at 3:16am, a bomb exploded at its [[headquarters]] in [[Funchal]]. The organization states that it views the news station as "leftist propaganda"&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtp.pt/play/p2560/e246961/umahistoriadeautonomia|title=Uma História de Autonomia - Episódio 7 -   RTP Play - RTP|work=RTP Play|access-date=2018-12-02|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Following that attack, whose main aim was to neutralize the electronic equipment of the station and therefore stop the news casting, a series of other attacks followed. Less than 24 hours later, another explosion took place at a bakery. The next bomb attack took place on the 29th of August, when a car from a well known politically left-oriented banker was the target of the explosion. On that same day, FLAMA releases [[Pamphlet|pamphlets]] stating its intentions to start a [[provisional government]] of Madeira and asking for the recognition of FLAMA "as the true representative of the will of Madeira's people"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. However, the director of FLAMA at the time, José Carvalho&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rtp.pt/madeira/politica/morreu-dirigente-historico-da-flama_6765|title=Morreu dirigente histórico da FLAMA|last=Madeira|first=RTP, Rádio e Televisão de Portugal - RTP|work=@rtppt|access-date=2018-12-02|language=pt-PT}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has stated that the move was "pure propaganda". Another attack followed, in the morning of the 31st of August, when another banker's car, João Abel Azevedo, was the target of the bomb attack. This attack led to the detention of a number of suspects by the local police forces, and when the news of the detentions was released in the 2nd of September, FLAMA retaliated and a [[firecracker]] was thrown at São Lourenço Palace.

One of FLAMA's most controversial moments however, came on the night of the 28th of August, when 6 young men with ages raging from 15 to 17, sprayed words in support of FLAMA and Madeira's independence on the walls of a tourist complex named [[:pt:Matur|Matur]], located in the municipality of [[Machico, Madeira|Machico]]. They were detained by the police forces, due to the security cameras at the site, and once the news spread regarding their detention there was popular outrage against their actions. However, as minors, they were released but the event, which captured significant media attention, became known as the "Popular Trial of Machico".

A manifestation against FLAMA and its actions was called on the 18th of September, and it turned into a protest against independence with banners reading "Death to FLAMA"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. The following morning, two [[firecracker]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are fired an the attacks were perpetrated by FLAMA, the first aimed at a car, the second bomb aimed at the house of a known syndicalist on the island. Several attacks took place in the following days, and after an occupation of another news broadcaster by a group of [[Expatriate|expatriates]] who had returned to Portugal following the [[Portuguese Colonial War|war for independence of Angola]] and [[Portuguese Colonial War|Mozambique]] and who demanded higher standards of living, three more attacks took place on the 10th, 12th, 15th and 21st of October&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.

After establishing contact with FLA, FLAMA's boldest attack took place on November 13th. At the [[Madeira Airport|Santa Catarina airport]], there were three planes, on of them a military one called Noratlas of the [[Portuguese Air Force]]. At the time, there were rumors that the military plane was supposed to carry a sum of money out of Madeira and to the mainland, and at 4:10, a bomb explodes under the plane's [[cockpit]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;, which causes significant damage to the plane and a fire at the airport. No suspects were detained due to the lack of evidence.

After a period of conversation and turmoil in the mainland, where elections had just taken place and Azores has plans of [[institutional autonomy]], FLAMA is behind another attack which took place on the 14th of January 1976. This was followed by, on the 19th of February, the visit of [[José Baptista Pinheiro de Azevedo]], Prime-Minister at the time, to start the talks with the local governmental authorities regarding the region's autonomy. On the 20th of February, following an explosion on a road in which the car of the Prime-Minister was passing, the documents granting a provisional government to the region of Madeira were signed.

Although FLAMA's activities were more sparse, the organization was still active. In the following months, merchandise featuring FLAMA's flag is distributed along with a new currency named "[[zarco]]{{dn|date=December 2018}}", which was supposed to act as Madeira's new currency. On the 24th of March, FLAMA decides to take on a political and organized approach, and so the Political Association of the Madeira Archipelago was founded.

On the 2nd of April, the [[Portuguese Constitution of 1976|Portuguese Constitution]] is approved in the [[Parliament]], and in it, there are 10 [[article]]s{{dn|date=December 2018}} which grant political and administrative autonomy to the Azores and Madeira&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parlamento.pt/Legislacao/Paginas/ConstituicaoRepublicaPortuguesa.aspx|title=Constituição da República Portuguesa|website=www.parlamento.pt|language=pt-PT|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

What was FLAMA's most complex operation to the time took place on the month of June. Involving 25 people and a bomb weighting 12 [[Kilogram|kilograms]] of [[gelignite]], the bomb was placed under a bridge in [[Água de Pena|Água-de-Pena]], whose target was the then Presidential candidate [[Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho]]. However, the bomb was deLfused when it was known that a bus of 20 children would be travelling with the commission travelling with the Presidential candidate at the time.

Following several strikes at the beginning of 1977 due to the delays in the transfer of administrative powers to the regional governments and the visit of then President [[António Ramalho Eanes|Ramalho Eanes]], another bomb was placed on the 26th of August in the offices of the Portuguese National Airline, [[TAP Air Portugal|TAP]]. While other minor incidents followed that one, [[arson]] became the new FLAMA strategy. The targets were the cars of university professors, syndicalists, members of parliament and journalists&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. However, this new phase of FLAMA "escaped the control" of the directory members, with one member in particular setting fires which were no longer under FLAMA's ideological motivations&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. He was identified as Eduardo Mendonça&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtp.pt/play/p2560/e250760/umahistoriadeautonomia|title=Uma História de Autonomia - Episódio 12 -   RTP Play - RTP|work=RTP Play|access-date=2018-12-02|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

At the end of 1977, the Portuguese Judiciary Police (from the Portuguese: ''[[Polícia Judiciária]]'') counts 14 bombings in Madeira, perpetrated by FLAMA.

On the 15th of February 1978, 3 suspects are detained and accused of terrorism and 219 objects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtp.pt/play/p2560/e250760/umahistoriadeautonomia|title=Uma História de Autonomia - Episódio 12 -   RTP Play - RTP|work=RTP Play|access-date=2018-12-02|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in bombing devices were found. As a reaction to the detentions, FLAMA reacts by leaving two firecrackers in the Place of Justice (from he Portuguese: ''[[Palácio da Justiça]]{{dn|date=December 2018}}'') in Funchal. On the 5th of April, two police officers and two tourists were injured in a car explosion set by FLAMA.

FLAMA's first deadly attack took place on the 23rd of August 1978, when a car bomb is set and the 19 year-old operational, João Alberto, who was installing it is killed. Another member, Alírio Paulo Fernandes, commits suicide while detained by the police. However, suicide was never confirmed as the cause of death which led to protests during his funeral, where independents accused the police of abuse of strength&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtp.pt/play/p2560/e250760/umahistoriadeautonomia|title=Uma História de Autonomia - Episódio 12 -   RTP Play - RTP|work=RTP Play|access-date=2018-12-02|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Following this event, FLAMA dispersed and there are no more records of any bombings.

== Recent Controversies ==
While it is said in multiple sources that the organization vanished due to its diminishing importance after 1976 and the establishment of Madeira as an autonomous region, recent news indicates the opposite.

Allegedly one of FLAMA's most important activists was the controversial [[Alberto João Jardim]], the former [[President of the regional government of Madeira]], co-founder of the Madeiran branch of the popular centre-right-wing Portuguese party [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|PSD]] and former Vice-president of the [[European People's Party]].&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']   &lt;/sup&gt;However, he has denied any connection to FLAMA, stating that “in contrary to what my political adversaries have accused me of- it’s not that FLAMA was dishonourable, in the contrary actually-, I not only have never belonged to its organizations, as I also never established any contact with them. Everyone had its role in defending democracy. Mine was ensuring the survival of [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|PSD]] and of ''Madeira’s Newspaper.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publico.pt/2017/04/10/politica/noticia/jardim-assegura-que-nunca-pertenceu-a-flama-e-que-nunca-estabeleceu-contactos-com-as-suas-organizacoes-1768330|title=Jardim assegura que nunca pertenceu à Flama|work=PÚBLICO|access-date=2018-12-01|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accusation is supported by a photo in which Albert João Jardim is wearing a shirt that states "Madeira, my Homeland"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://almanaquedosconflitos.wordpress.com/2017/02/01/frente-de-libertacao-do-arquipelago-da-madeira-flama/|title=Frente de Libertação do Arquipélago da Madeira (FLAMA)|date=2017-02-01|work=Almanaque dos Conflitos|access-date=2018-12-01|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1997, the Forum for Madeira’s Autonomy, or FAMA (originally in Portuguese: ''Fórum para a Autonomia da Madeira''), was created, which advocated for more autonomy. Although they rejected FLAMA's claims for independence, one of its members, Jaime Ramos, stated “Total autonomy” in reference to the archipelago&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://funchalnoticias.net/2015/10/19/fama-sera-dissolvida/|title=FAMA será dissolvida|website=funchalnoticias.net|language=pt-BR|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The organization was dissolved in October 2015&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

On the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of July 2011, the Region's Autonomy Day, fifty FLAMA flags were raised in several locations across the islands, and a statement was released claiming once again the Archipelago's independence. The statement released to the press was the following: “Today, the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of July of 2011, the day of the autonomy that doesn’t deserve to be celebrated, Madeira’s people woke up to an archipelago “dressed up” with its flag, and, after 35 years, it is a good time to reflect on what FLAMA has always proposed and what was accepted with open arms by some and questioned by others"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publico.pt/2011/07/02/jornal/flama-ica-bandeiras-e-exige-independencia-da-madeira-22400727|title=Flama iça bandeiras e exige independência da Madeira|last=Nóbrega|first=Tolentino de|work=PÚBLICO|access-date=2018-12-01|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This was followed by a member of Parliament, António Fontes, displaying a FLAMA flag in Parliament to prove that displaying such a flag was a crime, as that was the “flag of bombs”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/actualidade/deputado-desfralda-bandeira-da-flama-na-assembleia-da-madeira-video=f659921#gs.PUYDSu0|title=Deputado desfralda bandeira da FLAMA na Assembleia da Madeira (vídeo)|work=Jornal Expresso|access-date=2018-12-01|language=pt-PT}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2014, the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|Scottish Referendum for independence]], revived the conversation about the Archipelago's independence. In Funchal, FAMA's president, Gabriel Drumond, reaffirmed that the Madeira people have the right to be free from Portugal and that “no one could, democratically, stop them from holding a referendum”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publico.pt/2014/09/18/politica/noticia/referendo-da-escocia-ressuscita-separatismo-nos-acores-e-madeira-1670140|title=Referendo da Escócia “ressuscita” separatismo nos Açores e Madeira|last=Nóbrega|first=Tolentino de|work=PÚBLICO|access-date=2018-12-01|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Alberto João Jardim]] questioned “What has the Portuguese State given to Madeira so far, or what has it promised to Madeira?”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

'''Group Areas Act''' was the title of three [[act of parliament|acts]] of the [[Parliament of South Africa]] enacted under the [[apartheid]] [[government of South Africa]]. The acts assigned [[racial group]]s to different residential and business sections in urban areas in a system of [[urban apartheid]]. An effect of the law was to exclude non-Whites from living in areas which were restricted to Whites (e.g., [[Sea Point]], [[Lansdowne, Cape Town]], [[Claremont, Cape Town|Claremont]]). It caused many non-Whites to have to commute large distances from their homes in order to be able to work. The law led to non-Whites being forcibly removed for living in the "wrong" areas. The non-white majority were given much smaller areas (e.g., [[Tongaat]], [[Grassy Park]]) to live in than the white minority who owned most of the country. [[Pass laws|Pass Laws]] required that non-Whites carry pass books, and later 'reference books'&lt;ref&gt;Women's Anti-Pass Law Campaigns in South Africa http://africanhistory.about.com/od/apartheid/a/WomensAntiPass.htm&lt;/ref&gt; (similar to passports) to enter the 'white' parts of the country.

The first Group Areas Act, the ''Group Areas Act, 1950'' was promulgated on 7 July 1950, and it was implemented over a period of several years. It was amended by Parliament in 1952, 1955 (twice), 1956 and 1957. Later in 1957 it was repealed and re-enacted in consolidated form as the ''Group Areas Act, 1957'', which was amended in 1961, 1962, and 1965. In 1966 this version was in turn repealed and re-enacted as the ''Group Areas Act, 1966'', which was subsequently amended in 1969, 1972, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1982, and 1984. It was repealed (along with many other discriminatory laws) on 30 June 1991 by the [[Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991]].

==Background==
After the [[South African general election, 1948|1948 general election]], [[D.F. Malan]]'s administration commenced its policy of [[apartheid]] that sought to segregate the races in South Africa. The government hoped to achieve this through 'separate development' of the races and this entailed passing laws that would ensure a distinction on social, economic, political and, in the case of the Group Areas Act, geographical lines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-separate-development-south-africa The History of Separate Development in South Africa&lt;/ref&gt; The Group Areas Act may be regarded as an extension of the [[Asiatic Land Tenure Act, 1946]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davenport |first=T.R.H. |date=1978 |title=South Africa: A Modern History |url= |location= |publisher=CUP |page=259-9 |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
The Act empowered the Governor-General to declare certain geographical areas to be for the exclusive occupation of specific racial groups. In particular the statute identified three such racial groups: whites, [[coloured|coloureds]] and natives. This authority was exercised on the advice of the Minister of the Interior and the Group Areas Board.&lt;ref name="Loveland"&gt;{{cite book |last=Loveland |first=Ian |date=1999 |title=By Due Process of Law: Racial Discrimination &amp; the Right to Vote in South Africa 1855-1960 |url= |location= |publisher=Hart |page=242-3 |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an area had been designated for sole occupation by certain racial groups the proclamation would not become legally effective for at least one year.&lt;ref name="Loveland" /&gt; Once this time had expired it became a criminal offence to remain in occupation of property in that area with the punishment potentially being a fine and two years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;s. 34, Group Areas Act 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also applied to businesses with racial designation being applied on the basis of the individuals who held a controlling interest in the company.&lt;ref name="Loveland" /&gt;

==Impact==

The Act became an effective tool in the separate development of races in South Africa. It also granted the Minister of the Interior a mandate to forcibly remove non-whites from valuable pieces of land so that they could become white settlements.&lt;ref name="Loveland" /&gt;
===Sophiatown===
One of the most famous uses of the Group Areas Act was the destruction of [[Sophiatown]], a suburb of [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/urban-removals-destruction-sophiatown and district six
&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February 1955 2,000 policemen began removing residents to Meadowlands, [[Soweto]] and erected a new white-only area called ''Triomf'' (Triomf —Afrikaans for Triumph).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southafrica.info/about/history/sophiatown140206.htm#.Vbzqm_lViko Sophiatown again, 50 years on&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Basic forms of government}}
{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Subseries}}

A '''head of state''' (or '''chief of state''') is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a [[sovereign state]].&lt;ref name="Foakes2014"&gt;[[#Foakes|Foakes]], pp. 110–11&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the country's [[form of government]] and [[separation of powers]], the head of state may be a ceremonial [[figurehead]] or concurrently the [[head of government]]. In the [[parliamentary system]] the head of state is the ''[[de jure]]'' leader of the nation, because the leader ''[[de facto]]'' is the prime minister. In contrast, the [[semi-presidential system]] has both heads of state and government as the leaders ''de facto'' of the nation (in practice they divide the leadership of the nation among themselves).

In countries with parliamentary systems, the head of state is typically a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities or is not empowered to exercise any kind of political authority.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Foakes|Foakes]], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; In countries where the head of state is also the head of government, the head of state serves as both a public figurehead and the actual highest-ranking political leader who oversees the executive branch (e.g., the [[President of Brazil]]).&lt;ref name="Foakes2014"/&gt;

Former French president [[Charles de Gaulle]], while developing the current [[Constitution of France]] (1958), said the head of state should embody ''{{lang|fr|l’esprit de la nation}}'' ("the spirit of the nation").&lt;ref name="Kubicek2015"&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Kubicek|title=European Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9uoCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-34853-5|pages=154–56, 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent [[nation state]] normally has a head of state, and determines the extent of its head's executive powers of government or formal representational functions.&lt;ref name=Watts:0&gt;[[#Watts2010|Watts]].&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]]ary terms, the head of a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], independent state is usually identified as the person who, according to that state's constitution, is the reigning [[monarch]], in the case of a [[monarchy]], or the president, in the case of a [[republic]].

Among the different state [[constitution]]s (fundamental laws) that establish different political systems, four major types of heads of state can be distinguished:

# The [[parliamentary system]], with two subset models;
## The ''standard model'', in which the head of state, in theory, possesses key executive powers, but the exercise of such power is done on the binding advice of a [[head of government]] (e.g., [[United Kingdom]], [[India]], [[Germany]]).
## The ''non-executive model'', in which the head of state has either none or very limited executive powers, and mainly has a ceremonial and symbolic role (e.g., [[Sweden]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]]).
# The [[semi-presidential system]], in which the head of state shares key executive powers with a head of government or cabinet (e.g., [[Russia]], [[France]], [[Sri Lanka]]); and
# The [[presidential system]], in which the head of state is also the head of government and has all executive powers (e.g., [[United States]], [[Indonesia]]).

The same role in a federal constituent and a dependent territory is fulfilled by the corresponding office equivalent to that of a head of state. For example, in each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] the role is fulfilled by the [[lieutenant governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]], whereas in most [[British Overseas Territories]] the powers and duties are performed by the [[British Overseas Territories#Head of State|Governor]]. The same applies to [[Governors of the Australian states|Australian states]], [[Governors of states of India|Indian states]], etc. Hong Kong's constitutional document, the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], for example, specifies the [[Chief Executive (Hong Kong)|Chief Executive]] as the head of the special administrative region, in addition to his role as the head of government. These non-sovereign-state heads, nevertheless, have limited or no role in diplomatic affairs, depending on the status and the norms and practices of the territories concerned.

===Parliamentary system===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Austria]] --&gt;
[[File:Forms of government parliamentary.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|World's parliamentary states, as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, coloured by form of government&lt;br&gt;Green = republics with an executive president elected by a parliament&lt;br&gt;Orange = parliamentary republics&lt;br&gt;Red =   parliamentary constitutional monarchies in which the monarch does not personally exercise power]]

====Standard model====
In [[parliamentary system]]s the head of state may be merely the nominal [[chief executive officer]], heading the [[executive branch]] of the state, and possessing limited executive power. In reality, however, following a process of constitutional evolution, powers are usually only exercised by direction of a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]], presided over by a [[head of government]] who is answerable to the legislature. This accountability and legitimacy requires that someone be chosen who has a majority support in the [[legislature]] (or, at least, not a majority opposition – a subtle but important difference). It also gives the legislature the right to vote down the head of [[Forms of government|government]] and their cabinet, forcing it either to resign or seek a parliamentary dissolution. The [[Responsible government|executive branch is thus said to be responsible]] (or answerable) to the legislature, with the head of government and cabinet in turn accepting constitutional responsibility for offering constitutional [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] to the head of state.

In parliamentary [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], the legitimacy of the unelected head of state typically derives from the tacit approval of the people via the elected representatives. Accordingly, at the time of the [[Glorious Revolution]], the [[Parliament of England|English parliament]] acted of its own authority to name a new king and queen (the joint monarchs [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and [[William III of England|William III]]); likewise, [[Edward VIII]]'s abdication required the approval of each of the six independent realms of which he was monarch. In monarchies with a written constitution, the position of monarch is a creature of the constitution and could quite properly be abolished through a democratic procedure of constitutional amendment, although there are often significant procedural hurdles imposed on such a procedure (as in the [[Constitution of Spain]]).

In republics with a parliamentary system (such as India, Germany, Austria, Italy and Israel) the head of state is usually titled ''[[president]]'' and the principal functions of such presidents are mainly ceremonial and symbolic, as opposed to the presidents in a presidential or semi-presidential system.
[[File:Pranab Mukherjee-World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2009 crop(2).jpg|thumb|left|upright|President [[Pranab Mukherjee]], head of state of [[the Republic of India]] from July 2012 to July 2017]]

In reality, numerous variants exist to the position of a head of state within a parliamentary system. The older the constitution, the more constitutional leeway tends to exist for a head of state to exercise greater powers over government, as many older parliamentary system constitutions in fact give heads of state powers and functions akin to presidential or semi-presidential systems, in some cases without containing reference to modern democratic principles of accountability to parliament or even to modern governmental offices. Usually, the king had the power of declaring war without previous consent of the parliament.

For example, under the 1848 constitution of the [[Italy|Kingdom of Italy]], the ''[[Statuto Albertino]]''—the parliamentary approval to the government appointed by the king—was customary, but not required by law. So, Italy had a de facto parliamentarian system, but a de jure "presidential" system.

Examples of heads of state in parliamentary systems using greater powers than usual, either because of ambiguous constitutions or unprecedented national emergencies, include the decision by King [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III of the Belgians]] to surrender on behalf of his state to the invading German army in 1940, against the will of his government. Judging that his responsibility to the nation by virtue of his coronation oath required him to act, he believed that his government's decision to fight rather than surrender was mistaken and would damage Belgium. (Leopold's decision proved highly controversial. After [[World War II]], Belgium voted in a referendum to allow him back on the throne, but because of the ongoing controversy he ultimately abdicated.) The Belgian constitutional crisis in 1990, when the [[Baudouin of Belgium|head of state]] refused to sign into law a bill permitting abortion, was resolved by the cabinet assuming the power to promulgate the law while he was treated as "unable to reign" for twenty-four hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/05/world/belgian-king-unable-to-sign-abortion-law-takes-day-off.html|title=Belgian King, Unable to Sign Abortion Law, Takes Day Off|date=5 April 1990|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art. 93. "Should the King find himself unable to reign, the ministers, having observed this inability, immediately summon the Chambers. Regency and guardianship are to be provided by the united Chambers." ''The Constitution of Belgium, Coordinated text of 14 February 1994 (last updated 8 May 2007)''{{cite web |url=http://home.scarlet.be/dirkvanheule/compcons/ConstitutionBelgium/ConstitutionBelgium.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601055805/http://home.scarlet.be/dirkvanheule/compcons/ConstitutionBelgium/ConstitutionBelgium.htm |archivedate=1 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-executive model====

These officials are excluded completely from the executive: they do not possess even theoretical executive powers or any role, even formal, within the government. Hence their states' governments are not referred to by the traditional parliamentary model head of state [[Style (manner of address)|styles]] of ''His/Her Majesty's Government'' or ''His/Her Excellency's Government''. Within this general category, variants in terms of powers and functions may exist.

The {{nihongo|[[Constitution of Japan]]|日本国憲法|Nihonkoku-Kenpō}} was drawn up under the [[Occupation of Japan|Allied occupation]] that followed [[World War II]] and was intended to replace the previous [[Militarism|militaristic]] and quasi-[[absolute monarchy]] system with a form of liberal democracy [[parliamentary system]]. The constitution explicitly vests all executive power in the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]], who is chaired by the [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime minister]] (articles 65 and 66) and responsible to the [[National Diet|Diet]] (articles 67 and 69). The [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] is defined in the constitution as "the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people" (article 1), and is generally recognized throughout the world as the Japanese head of state. Although the emperor formally [[Imperial Investiture|appoints]] the prime minister to office, article 6 of the constitution requires him to appoint the candidate "as designated by the Diet", without any right to decline appointment. He is a ceremonial [[figurehead]] with no independent discretionary powers related to the governance of Japan.&lt;ref name=unprotocol&gt;[https://www.un.int/protocol/sites/www.un.int/files/Protocol%20and%20Liaison%20Service/hspmfm.pdf HEADS OF STATE, HEADS OF GOVERNMENT, MINISTERS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS], Protocol and Liaison Service, United Nations (8 April 2016).

Since the passage in [[Sweden]] of the [[Instrument of Government (1974)|1974 Instrument of Government]], the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Swedish monarch]] no longer has many of the standard parliamentary system head of state functions that had previously belonged to him or her, as was the case in the preceding [[Instrument of Government (1809)|1809 Instrument of Government]]. Today, the [[Speaker of the Riksdag]] appoints (following a vote in the [[Riksdag]]) the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|prime minister]] and terminates his or her commission following a [[vote of no confidence]] or voluntary resignation. Cabinet members are appointed and dismissed at the sole discretion of the prime minister. Laws and ordinances are promulgated by two Cabinet members in unison signing "On Behalf of the Government" and the government—not the monarch—is the [[high contracting party]] with respect to international treaties. The remaining official functions of the sovereign, by constitutional mandate or by unwritten convention, are to open the annual session of the Riksdag, receive foreign ambassadors and sign the [[Letter of credence|letters of credence]] for Swedish ambassadors, chair the foreign advisory committee, preside at the special Cabinet council when a new prime minister takes office, and to be kept informed by the prime minister on matters of state.&lt;ref name="sweden ig"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/monarchy/themonarchyinsweden/dutiesofthemonarch.4.396160511584257f2180003302.html Duties of the Monarch], [[Royal Court of Sweden]].

In contrast, the only contact the [[President of Ireland]] has with the Irish government is through a formal briefing session given by the [[Taoiseach]] (head of government) to the president. However, he or she has no access to documentation and all access to ministers goes through the [[Department of the Taoiseach]]. The president does, however, hold limited [[reserve powers]], such as referring a bill to the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] to test its constitutionality, which are used under the president's discretion.&lt;ref name=ireland/&gt;

The most extreme non-executive republican Head of State is the [[President of Israel]], which holds no reserve powers whatsoever. The least ceremonial powers held by the President are to appoint the [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]], to approve the dissolution of the [[Knesset]] made by the Prime Minister, and to pardon criminals or to commute their sentence.

====Executive model====

Some parliamentary republics (like [[South Africa]], [[Botswana]] and [[Suriname]]) have fused the roles of the head of state with the head of government (like in a presidential system), while having the sole executive officer, often called a president, being dependent on the Parliament's confidence to rule (like in a parliamentary system). While also being the leading symbol of the nation, the president in this system acts mostly as a prime minister, since the incumbent must be a member of the legislature at the time of the election, answer [[question time|question sessions]] in Parliament, avoid motions of no confidence, etc.

===Semi-presidential systems===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F010324-0002, Flughafen Köln-Bonn, Adenauer, de Gaulle-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles de Gaulle]], President and head of state of the [[French Fifth Republic]] (1959–1969)]]
{{Main article|Semi-presidential system}}
Semi-presidential systems combine features of presidential and parliamentary systems, notably (in the president-parliamentary subtype) a requirement that the government be answerable to both the president and the legislature. The [[Constitution of France|constitution]] of the [[Fifth French Republic]] provides for a [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]] who is chosen by the president, but who nevertheless must be able to gain support in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]]. Should a president be of one side of the political spectrum and the opposition be in control of the legislature, the president is usually obliged to select someone from the opposition to become prime minister, a process known as [[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]. President [[François Mitterrand]], a Socialist, for example, was forced to cohabit with the [[Gaullism|neo-Gaullist]] (right wing) [[Jacques Chirac]], who became his prime minister from 1986 to 1988. In the French system, in the event of cohabitation, the president is often allowed to set the policy agenda in security and foreign affairs and the prime minister runs the domestic and economic agenda.

Other countries evolve into something akin to a semi-presidential system or indeed a full presidential system. [[Weimar Germany]], for example, in its constitution provided for a popularly elected president with theoretically dominant executive powers that were intended to be exercised only in emergencies, and a cabinet appointed by him from the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], which was expected, in normal circumstances, to be answerable to the Reichstag. Initially, the President was merely a symbolic figure with the Reichstag dominant; however, persistent political instability, in which governments often lasted only a few months, led to a change in the power structure of the republic, with the president's emergency powers called increasingly into use to prop up governments challenged by critical or even hostile Reichstag votes. By 1932, power had shifted to such an extent that the German President, [[Paul von Hindenburg]], was able to dismiss a [[chancellor]] and select his own person for the job, even though the outgoing chancellor possessed the confidence of the Reichstag while the new chancellor did not. Subsequently, President von Hindenburg used his power to appoint [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor without consulting the Reichstag.

===Presidential system===
[[File:Washington (3).jpg|thumb|[[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States]], set the precedent for an executive head of state in republican systems of government&lt;ref&gt;Lifetime portrait (1796), known as the "[[Lansdowne portrait]]", includes spines of two books titled "American Revolution" and "Constitution and Laws of the United States".&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main article|Presidential system}}

''Note: The head of state in a "presidential" system may not actually hold the title of "[[president]]" - the name of the system refers to any head of state who actually governs and is not directly dependent on the [[legislature]] to remain in office.''

Some constitutions or fundamental laws provide for a head of state who is not only in theory but in practice chief executive, operating separately from, and independent from, the legislature. This system is known as a "presidential system" and sometimes called the "imperial model", because the executive officials of the government are answerable solely and exclusively to a presiding, acting head of state, and is selected by and on occasion dismissed by the head of state without reference to the legislature. It is notable that some presidential systems, while not providing for collective executive accountability to the legislature, may require legislative approval for individuals prior to their assumption of cabinet office and empower the legislature to remove a president from office (for example, in the [[United States|United States of America]]). In this case the debate centers on confirming them into office, not removing them from office, and does not involve the power to reject or approve proposed cabinet members ''en bloc'', so it is not accountability in the sense understood in a parliamentary system.

[[Presidential system]]s are a notable feature of constitutions in the [[Americas]], including those of [[President of Argentina|Argentina]], [[President of Brazil|Brazil]], [[President of Colombia|Colombia]], [[President of El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[President of Mexico|Mexico]] and [[President of Venezuela|Venezuela]]; this is generally attributed to the strong influence of the [[United States]] in the region, and as the [[United States Constitution]] served as an inspiration and model for the [[Latin American wars of independence]] of the early 19th century. Most presidents in such countries are selected by democratic means (popular direct or indirect election); however, like all other systems, the presidential model also encompasses people who become head of state by other means, notably through military dictatorship or ''[[coup d'état]]'', as often seen in [[Latin America]]n, [[Middle East]]ern and other presidential regimes. Some of the characteristics of a presidential system (i.e., a strong dominant political figure with an executive answerable to them, not the legislature) can also be found among [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]], [[constitutional monarchy|parliamentary monarchies]] and [[single party]] (e.g., [[Communism|Communist]]) regimes, but in most cases of dictatorship, their stated constitutional models are applied in name only and not in political theory or practice.

In the 1870s in the United States, in the aftermath of the [[impeachment]] of President [[Andrew Johnson]] and his near-removal from office, it was speculated that the United States, too, would move from a presidential system to a semi-presidential or even parliamentary one, with the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] becoming the [[De facto|real]] center of government as a quasi-prime minister.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} This did not happen and the presidency, having been damaged by three late nineteenth and early twentieth century assassinations ([[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], [[James Garfield|Garfield]] and [[William McKinley|McKinley]]) and one impeachment (Johnson), reasserted its political dominance by the early twentieth century through such figures as [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]].

===Single-party states===
In certain states under [[Marxism|Marxist]] constitutions of the [[Socialist state|constitutionally socialist state]] type inspired by the former [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) and its constitutive [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]], real political power belonged to the sole legal party.  In these states, there was no formal office of head of state, but rather the leader of the legislative branch was considered to be the closest common equivalent of a head of state as a [[natural person]]. In the Soviet Union this position carried such titles as ''Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR''; ''Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet''; and in the case of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] ''Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets'' (pre-1922), and ''Chairman of the [[Bureau of the Central Committee]] of the Russian SFSR'' (1956–1966). This position may or may not have been held by the [[de facto]] Soviet leader at the moment. For example, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] never headed the Supreme Soviet but was [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party]] (party leader) and [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Chairman of the Council of Ministers]] ([[head of government]]).

This may even lead to an institutional variability, as in [[North Korea]], where, after the presidency of party leader [[Kim Il-Sung]], the office was vacant for years. The late president was granted the posthumous title (akin to some ancient Far Eastern traditions to give posthumous names and titles to royalty) of ''"[[Eternal President of the Republic|Eternal President]]"''. All substantive power, as party leader, itself not formally created for four years, was inherited by his son [[Kim Jong Il]]. The post of president was formally replaced on 5 September 1998, for ceremonial purposes, by the office of Chairman of the Presidium of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]], while the party leader's post as [[First Chairman of the National Defence Commission of North Korea|Chairman of the National Defense Commission]] was simultaneously declared "the highest post of the state", not unlike [[Deng Xiaoping]] earlier in the [[People's Republic of China]].

===Complications with categorization===
[[File:Delhi durbar 1911 2.jpg|thumb|[[George V]], Emperor of India, and Empress Mary at the [[Delhi Durbar]], 1911.]]

While clear categories do exist, it is sometimes difficult to choose which category some individual heads of state belong to. In reality, the category to which each head of state belongs is assessed not by theory but by practice.

Constitutional change in [[Liechtenstein]] in 2003 gave its head of state, the [[Prince of Liechtenstein|Reigning Prince]], constitutional powers that included a veto over legislation and power to dismiss the [[List of heads of government of Liechtenstein|head of government]] and cabinet.&lt;ref name=liechtenstein&gt;[http://www.icla.up.ac.za/images/un/use-of-force/western-europe-others/Liechtenstein/Constitution%20Liechtenstein%202009.pdf Constitution of the Principality of Liechtenstein (LR 101)] (2009). Retrieved on 3 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It could be argued that the strengthening of the Prince's powers, vis-a-vis the [[Landtag of Liechtenstein|Landtag]] (legislature), has moved Liechtenstein into the semi-presidential category. Similarly the original powers given to the [[List of Presidents of Greece|Greek President]] under the [[Constitution of Greece|1974 Hellenic Republic constitution]] moved [[Greece]] closer to the French semi-presidential model.

Another complication exists with [[South Africa]], in which the [[President of South Africa|President]] is in fact elected by the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] ([[legislature]]) and is thus similar, in principle, to a [[head of government]] in a [[parliamentary system]] but is also, in addition, recognized as the head of state.&lt;ref name="south africa"&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/constitution/SAConstitution-web-eng.pdf Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996], [[Department of Justice and Constitutional Development]] (2009).

[[Panama]], during the military dictatorships of [[Omar Torrijos]] and [[Manuel Noriega]], was nominally a presidential republic. However, the [[List of heads of state of Panama|elected civilian presidents]] were effectively figureheads with real political power being exercised by the chief of the [[Panamanian Public Forces|Panamanian Defense Forces]].

Historically, at the time of the [[League of Nations]] (1920–1946) and the founding of the [[United Nations]] (1945), [[British India|India's]] head of state was the monarch of the United Kingdom, ruling directly or indirectly as [[Emperor of India]] through the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy and Governor-General]] of India.

Head of state is the highest-ranking constitutional position in a sovereign state.  A head of state has some or all of the roles listed below, often depending on the constitutional category (above), and does not necessarily regularly exercise the most power or influence of governance.  There is usually a formal public ceremony when a person becomes head of state, or some time after. This may be the swearing in at the [[inauguration]] of a president of a republic, or the [[coronation]] of a monarch.

===Symbolic role===
One of the most important roles of the modern head of state is being a living [[national symbol]] of the state; in hereditary monarchies this extends to the monarch being a symbol of the unbroken continuity of the state. For instance, the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]] is described by the government as being the [[Monarchy of Canada#Personification of the Canadian state|personification of the Canadian state]] and is described by the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] as the "personal symbol of allegiance, unity and authority for all Canadians".&lt;ref name=Heritage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1363187221658|title=The Crown in Canada|accessdate=31 August 2014|publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/Canada/TheQueensroleinCanada.aspx The Queen's role in Canada], [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]]. Retrieved on 2 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, official [[portrait]]s of the head of state can be found in government offices, courts of law, even airports, libraries, and other public buildings. The idea, sometimes regulated by law, is to use these portraits to make the public aware of the symbolic connection to the government, a practice that dates back to medieval times. Sometimes this practice is taken to excess, and the head of state becomes the principal symbol of the nation, resulting in the emergence of a [[personality cult]] where the image of the head of state is the only visual representation of the country, surpassing other symbols such as the [[flag]].

Other common representations are on [[coin]]s, [[Postage stamp|postage and other stamps]] and [[banknote]]s, sometimes by no more than a mention or signature; and public places, streets, monuments and institutions such as schools are named for current or previous heads of state. In monarchies (e.g., Belgium) there can even be a practice to attribute the adjective "royal" on demand based on existence for a given number of years. However, such political techniques can also be used by leaders without the formal rank of head of state, even party - and other revolutionary leaders without formal state mandate.

Heads of state often greet important foreign visitors, particularly visiting heads of state. They assume a host role during a [[state visit]], and the programme may feature playing of the [[national anthem]]s by a [[military band]], inspection of [[Guard of honour|military troops]], official exchange of gifts, and attending a [[state dinner]] at the [[official residence]] of the host.

At home, heads of state are expected to render luster to various occasions by their presence, such as by attending artistic or sports performances or competitions (often in a theatrical honor box, on a platform, on the front row, at the honours table), expositions, [[National Day|national day celebrations]], dedication events, military parades and war remembrances, prominent funerals, visiting different parts of the country and people from different walks of life, and at times performing symbolic acts such as [[Ribbon-cutting ceremony|cutting a ribbon]], [[groundbreaking]], [[Ship naming and launching|ship christening]], laying the first stone. Some parts of national life receive their regular attention, often on an annual basis, or even in the form of official patronage.

The [[Olympic Charter]] (rule 55.3) of the [[International Olympic Committee]] states that the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic summer]] and [[Winter Olympic Games|winter games]] shall be [[List of people who have opened the Olympic Games|opened by]] the head of state of the host nation, by uttering a single formulaic phrase as determined by the charter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://stillmed.olympic.org/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/General/EN-Olympic-Charter.pdf Olympic Charter: in force as of 2 August 2016], [[International Olympic Committee]] (August 2016). Retrieved on 13 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

As such invitations may be very numerous, such duties are often in part [[delegation|delegated]] to such persons as a spouse, a [[head of government]] or a [[cabinet minister]] or in other cases (possibly as a message, for instance, to distance themselves without rendering offense) just a military officer or civil servant.

For non-executive heads of state there is often a degree of censorship by the politically responsible government (such as the [[head of government]]). This means that the government discreetly approves agenda and speeches, especially where the constitution (or customary law) assumes all political responsibility by granting the crown inviolability (in fact also imposing political emasculation) as in the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] from its very beginning; in a monarchy this may even be extended to some degree to other members of the dynasty, especially the heir to the throne.

===Executive role===
In the majority of states, whether republics or monarchies, [[executive branch|executive authority]] is vested, at least notionally, in the head of state. In presidential systems the head of state is the actual, [[de facto]] chief executive officer. Under parliamentary systems the executive authority is exercised by the head of state, but in practice is done so on the advice of the cabinet of ministers. This produces such terms as "Her Majesty's Government" and "His Excellency's Government." Examples of parliamentary systems in which the head of state is notional chief executive include [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

====Appointment of senior officials====
The head of state usually appoints most or all the key officials in the government, including the [[head of government]] and other cabinet ministers, key judicial figures; and all major office holders in the [[civil service]], [[foreign service]] and [[commissioned officer|commissioned officers in the military]]. In many parliamentary systems, the head of government is appointed with the consent (in practice often decisive) of the legislature, and other figures are appointed on the head of government's advice.

In practice, these decisions are often a formality. The last time the [[prime minister of the United Kingdom]] was unilaterally selected by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] was in 1963, when Queen [[Elizabeth II]] appointed [[Alec Douglas-Home]] on the advice of outgoing Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]].

In presidential systems, such as that of the United States, appointments are nominated by the president's sole discretion, but this nomination is often subject to confirmation by the legislature; and specifically in the US, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] has to approve senior executive branch and judicial appointments by a simple majority vote.&lt;ref name="us constitution"/&gt;

The head of state may also dismiss office-holders. There are many variants on how this can be done. For example, members of the Irish Cabinet are dismissed by the [[President of Ireland|president]] on the advice of the [[taoiseach]]; in other instances, the head of state may be able to dismiss an office holder unilaterally; other heads of state, or their representatives, have the theoretical power to dismiss any office-holder, while it is exceptionally rarely used.&lt;ref name=ireland&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/en/constitution/index.html Constitution of Ireland], Office of the Attorney General (December 2013). Retrieved 3 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[France]], while the [[President of France|president]] cannot force the [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]] to tender the resignation of the government, he can, in practice, request it if the prime minister is from his own majority.&lt;ref name=france/&gt; In presidential systems, the president often has the power to fire ministers at his sole discretion. In the United States, the unwritten convention calls for the [[United States federal executive departments|heads of the executive departments]] to resign on their own initiative when called to do so.

:::''The [[Monarchy of Belgium|King]] appoints and dismisses his ministers.&lt;br /&gt;The [[Cabinet of Belgium|Federal Government]] offers its resignation to the King if the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|House of Representatives]], by an absolute majority of its members, adopts a motion of no confidence proposing a successor to the [[Prime Minister of Belgium|prime minister]] for appointment by the King or proposes a successor to the prime minister for appointment by the King within three days of the rejection of a motion of confidence.

However, there are provisions in the Vienna Convention that a diplomatic agent of lesser rank, such as a [[Chargé d'affaires]], is accredited to the [[minister of foreign affairs]] (or equivalent).&lt;ref name="vienna diplomatic"/&gt;

The head of state is often designated the [[high contracting party]] in international treaties on behalf of the state; signs them either personally or has them signed in his/her name by ministers (government members or diplomats); subsequent [[ratification]], when necessary, may rest with the [[legislature]]. The treaties constituting the [[European Union]] and the [[European Communities]] are noteworthy contemporary cases of multilateral treaties cast in this traditional format, as are the accession agreements of new member states.&lt;ref name=Roberts:542-543&gt;[[#Roberts|Roberts]]: pp. 542-543.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:FULL:EN:PDF Treaty of Lisbon (OJ C 306, 17.12.2007)], [[Official Journal of the European Union]] through [[EUR-Lex]].

====Military role====
{{Main article|Commander in Chief}}
[[File:21 juli 2011 Defilé Koning Albert II.png|thumb|[[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]], [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of the Belgians]] inspecting [[Belgian Armed Forces|troops]] on Belgium's [[national day]] in 2011]]

A head of state is often, by virtue of holding the highest executive powers, explicitly designated as the [[commander-in-chief]] of that nation's [[armed forces]], holding the highest office in all military [[chain of command|chains of command]].

In a constitutional monarchy or non-executive presidency, the head of state may [[de jure]] hold ultimate authority over the armed forces but will only normally, as per either written law or unwritten convention, exercise their authority on the advice of their responsible ministers: meaning that the [[de facto]] ultimate decision making on military maneuvers is made elsewhere. The head of state will, regardless of actual authority, perform ceremonial duties related to the country's armed forces, and will sometimes appear in military uniform for these purposes; particularly in monarchies where also the monarch's consort and other members of a [[royal family]] may also appear in military garb. This is generally the only time a head of state of a stable, democratic country will appear dressed in such a manner, as statesmen and public are eager to assert the [[civilian control of the military|primacy of (civilian, elected) politics over the armed forces]].

In [[military dictatorship]]s, or governments which have arisen from [[coups d'état]], the position of commander-in-chief is obvious, as all authority in such a government derives from the application of military force; occasionally a power vacuum created by war is filled by a head of state stepping beyond his or her normal constitutional role, as King [[Albert I of Belgium]] did during [[World War I]]. In these and in revolutionary regimes, the head of state, and often [[executive minister]]s whose offices are legally civilian, will frequently appear in military uniform.

===Legislative roles===
It is usual that the head of state, particularly in parliamentary systems as part of the symbolic role, is the one who opens the annual sessions of the legislature, [[Exempli gratia|e.g.]] the annual [[State Opening of Parliament]] with the [[Speech from the Throne]] in Britain. Even in presidential systems the head of state often formally reports to the legislature on the present national status, [[Exempli gratia|e.g.]] the [[State of the Union address]] in the United States of America.

Most countries require that all [[bill (proposed law)|bill]]s passed by the house or houses of the legislature be signed into law by the head of state. In some states, such as the United Kingdom, Belgium and Ireland, the head of state is, in fact, formally considered a tier of the legislature. However, in most parliamentary systems, the head of state cannot refuse to sign a bill, and, in granting a bill their assent, indicate that it was passed in accordance with the correct procedures. The signing of a bill into law is formally known as ''[[promulgation]]''. Some monarchical states call this procedure ''[[royal assent]]''.

::''Example 1 (non-executive parliamentary monarchy):'' Chapter 1, Article 4 of the [[Constitution of Sweden|Swedish ''Riksdag Act'']] provides that:
:::''The formal opening of a [[Riksdag of Sweden|Riksdag]] session takes place at a special meeting of the Chamber held no later than the third day of the session.

In some parliamentary systems, the head of state retains certain powers in relation to bills to be exercised at his or her discretion. They may have authority to veto a bill until the houses of the legislature have reconsidered it, and approved it a second time; reserve a bill to be signed later, or suspend it indefinitely (generally in states with [[royal prerogative]]; this power is rarely used); refer a bill to the courts to test its constitutionality; refer a bill to the people in a [[referendum]].

If he or she is also chief executive, he or she can thus politically control the necessary executive measures without which a proclaimed law can remain dead letter, sometimes for years or even forever.

===Summoning and dissolving the legislature===
A head of state is often empowered to summon and dissolve the country's [[legislature]]. In most [[parliamentary system]]s, this is often done on the advice of the [[head of government]]. In some parliamentary systems, and in some presidential systems, however, the head of state may do so on their own initiative. Some states have fixed term legislatures, with no option of bringing forward elections (e.g., Article II, Section 3, of the [[U.S. Constitution]]&lt;ref name="us constitution"/&gt;). In other systems there are usually fixed terms, but the head of state retains authority to dissolve the legislature in certain circumstances. Where a head of government has lost support in the legislature, some heads of state may refuse a dissolution, where one is requested, thereby forcing the head of government's resignation.

::''Example 1 (parliamentary non-executive republic):'' Article 13.2.2. of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] states:

In the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, other than the United Kingdom, a governor-general (''governor general'' in Canada) is appointed by the sovereign, on the advice of the relevant prime minister, as a representative and to exercise almost all the [[Royal Prerogative]] according to established constitutional authority. In Australia the present Queen is generally assumed to be head of state, since the governor-general and the state governors are defined as her "representatives".&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, s 2;  Australia Act 1986 (Cth and UK), s 7.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the governor-general performs almost all national regal functions, the governor-general has occasionally [[Australian head of state dispute|been referred to as head of state]] in political and media discussion. To a lesser extent, uncertainty has been expressed [[Monarchy of Canada#Head of state|in Canada]] as to which officeholder—the monarch, the governor general, or both—can be considered the head of state. New Zealand,&lt;ref name="new zealand"/&gt; [[Papua New Guinea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=199188#LinkTarget_1841| author=Elizabeth II| title=Constitution of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea| id=Part 5, Division 1, (1)(a)| location=Port Moresby| date=1975| publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization| accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tuvalu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.paclii.org/tv/legis/consol_act/cot277/| author=Elizabeth II| title=Constitution of Tuvalu| id=48(1)| location=Funafuti| date=1978| publisher=Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute| accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly name the monarch as their head of state (though Tuvalu's constitution states that "references in any law to the Head of State shall be read as including a reference to the Governor-General"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Elizabeth II| 1978| loc=51(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Governors-general are frequently treated as heads of state on state and official visits; at the [[United Nations]], they are accorded the status of head of state in addition to the sovereign.&lt;ref name=unprotocol/&gt;

An example of a governor-general departing from [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] by acting unilaterally (that is, without direction from ministers, parliament, or the monarch) occurred in 1926, when [[Governor General of Canada|Canada's governor general]] [[King–Byng Affair|refused the head of government's formal advice]] requesting a dissolution of parliament and a general election. In a letter informing the monarch after the event, the Governor General said: "I have to await the verdict of history to prove my having adopted a wrong course, and this I do with an easy conscience that, right or wrong, I have acted in the interests of Canada and implicated no one else in my decision."

Another example occurred when, in the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]], the Governor-General unexpectedly dismissed the Prime Minister in order to break a stalemate between the House of Representatives and Senate over money bills. The Governor-General issued a public statement saying he felt it was the only solution consistent with the constitution, his oath of office, and his responsibilities, authority, and duty as governor-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/1975/11/11/kerr-statement-of-reasons.html|title=Kerr's Statement Of Reasons|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter from the Queen's [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign|Private Secretary]] at the time, [[Martin Charteris, Baron Charteris of Amisfield|Martin Charteris]], confirmed that the only person competent to commission an Australian prime minister was the governor-general and it would not be proper for the monarch to personally intervene in matters that the Constitution Act so clearly places within the governor-general's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, John (1978), Matters for Judgment, Macmillan, {{ISBN|978-0-333-25212-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Commonwealth realms that are now constituted with a governor-general as the [[List of viceregal representatives of Elizabeth II|viceregal representative of Elizabeth II]] are: [[List of Governors-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Governor-General of the Bahamas|the Bahamas]], [[Governor-General of Belize|Belize]], [[Governor-General of Grenada|Grenada]], [[Governor-General of Jamaica|Jamaica]], [[Governor-General of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Governor-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Governor-General of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia]], and [[List of Governors-General of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]].

==Selection and various types and styles of heads of state==
Although many constitutions, particularly from the 19th century and earlier, make no explicit mention of a head of state in the generic sense of several present day international treaties, the officeholders corresponding to this position are recognized as such by other countries.&lt;ref name=unprotocol/&gt;&lt;ref name="vienna diplomatic"/&gt; In a monarchy, the [[monarch]] is generally understood to be the head of state.&lt;ref name=unprotocol/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robertson:221&gt;[[#Robertson|Robertson]]: p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roberts:35-44&gt;[[#Roberts|Roberts]]: pp. 35-44.&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[republic]], the head of state nowadays usually bears the title of [[President]], but some have or had had other titles.&lt;ref name=unprotocol/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robertson:221/&gt;

In medieval Europe, it was universally accepted that the [[Pope]] ranked first among all rulers and was followed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref name=Roberts:39&gt;[[#Roberts|Roberts]]: p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope also had the sole right to determine the precedence of all others.&lt;ref name=Roberts:39/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roberts:37-38&gt;[[#Roberts|Roberts]]: pp. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle was first challenged by a Protestant ruler, [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] and was later maintained by his country at the [[Congress of Westphalia]].&lt;ref name=Roberts:39/&gt;  Great Britain would later claim a break of the old principle for the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance]] in 1718.&lt;ref name=Roberts:39/&gt;{{refn|group=note|On the occasion of a royal marriage in 1760, the [[premier of Portugal]], the [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]], tried to maintain that the host, the [[King of Portugal]], should as a crowned head have the sovereign right to determine the precedence of how ambassadors (apart from the papal nuncio and the imperial ambassador) would rank, based on the date of their credentials. The pragmatic suggestions of Pombal was not successful, and as the pretensions among the great powers were so deep-rooted, it would take the [[Napoleonic Wars]] for the great powers to have a fresh look at the issue.&lt;ref name=Roberts:41-42&gt;[[#Roberts|Roberts]]: pp. 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, it was not until the [[1815 Congress of Vienna]], when it was decided (due to the abolition of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806 and the weak position of France and other catholic states to assert themselves) and remains so to this day, that all sovereign states are treated as equals, whether monarchies or republics.&lt;ref name=Roberts:42-43&gt;[[#Roberts|Roberts]]: pp. 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt; On occasions when multiple heads of state or their representatives meet, precedence is by the host usually determined in alphabetical order (in whatever language the host determines, although [[French language|French]] has for much of the 19th and 20th centuries been the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of diplomacy) or by date of accession.&lt;ref name=Roberts:42-43/&gt; Contemporary international law on precedence, built upon the universally admitted principles since 1815, derives from the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] (in particular, articles 13, 16.1 and Appendix iii).&lt;ref name=Roberts:43&gt;[[#Roberts|Roberts]]: p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several methods of [[head of state succession]] in the event of the removal, disability or death of an incumbent head of state.

===European writers and revolutions, 16th&amp;ndash;20th centuries===
[[Niccolò Machiavelli]] used ''[[Prince]]'' ({{lang-it|Principe}}) as a generic term for the ruler, similar to contemporary usage of ''head of state'', in his classical [[treatise]] ''[[The Prince]]'', originally published in 1532: in fact that particular literary [[genre]] it belongs to is known as [[Mirrors for princes]]. [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) used the term ''Sovereign''. In [[Europe]] the role of a monarchs has gradually transitioned from that of a sovereign ruler{{mdash}}in the sense of [[Divine Right of Kings]] as articulated by [[Jean Bodin]], [[Absolute monarchy|Absolutism]] and the "[[L'etat c'est moi]]"{{mdash}}to that of a constitutional monarch; parallel with the conceptual evolution of [[sovereignty]] from merely the personal rule of a single person, to [[Westphalian sovereignty]] ([[Peace of Westphalia]] ending both the [[Thirty Years' War]] &amp; [[Eighty Years' War]]) and [[popular sovereignty]] as in [[consent of the governed]]; as shown in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 in [[England]] &amp; [[Scotland]], the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, and the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]]. The monarchies who survived through this era were the ones who were willing to subject themselves to constitutional limitations. Titles commonly used by monarchs are [[King]]/[[Queen Regnant|Queen]] or [[Emperor]]/[[Empress]], but also many other; e.g., [[Grand Duke]], [[Prince]], [[Emir]] and [[Sultan]].

===Shared and substitute heads of state===

====Interim====
Whenever a head of state is not available for any reason, constitutional provisions may allow the role to fall temporarily to an assigned person or collective body. In a republic, this is - depending on provisions outlined by the constitution or improvised - a [[vice president]], the chief of government, the legislature or its presiding officer. In a monarchy, this is usually a [[regent]] or collegial regency (council). For example, in the United States the Vice President acts when the President is incapacitated, and in the United Kingdom the Queen's powers may be delegated to [[Counsellor of State|Counselors of State]] when she is abroad or unavailable.

====Shared====
In some countries where there is no resident head of state, such as [[Andorra]], a local representative is appointed. In the case of [[Andorra]], two [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|co-princes]] act as the principality's heads of state; one is also simultaneously the [[President of France]], residing in France, and the other is the [[Diocese of Urgell|Bishop of Urgell]], residing in [[Spain]]. Each co-prince is represented in Andorra by a delegate, though these persons hold no formal title.

====Extraordinary arrangements====
In exceptional situations, such as war, occupation, revolution or a [[coup d'état]], constitutional institutions, including the symbolically crucial head of state, may be reduced to a figurehead or be suspended in favor of an emergency office (such as the original Roman [[Dictator]]) or eliminated by a new "provisionary" regime, such as a collective of the [[Military dictatorship|junta]] type, or removed by an occupying force, such as a [[Military occupation|military governor]] (an early example being the [[Sparta]]n [[Harmost]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

===Religious heads of state===
[[File:Pope Francis in March 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope Francis|Francis]], from March 2013 the [[List of sovereigns of Vatican City State|sovereign of the Vatican City State]], an ''ex officio'' role of the [[Pope]]]]

Since [[ancient history|antiquity]], various [[dynasty|dynasties]] or individual rulers have claimed the right to rule by divine authority, such as the [[Mandate of Heaven]] and the [[divine right of kings]]. Some monarchs even claimed divine ancestry, such as Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s and [[Sapa Inca]]s, who claimed descent from their respective sun gods and often sought to maintain this bloodline by practicing [[incest|incestuous marriage]]. In [[Ancient Rome]], during the [[Principate]], the title {{lang|la|divus}} ('divine') was conferred (notably posthumously) on the [[Roman emperor|emperor]], a symbolic, [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimating]] element in establishing a [[de facto]] dynasty.

====Christianity====
In [[Roman Catholicism]], the [[pope]] was once sovereign pontiff and head of state, first, of the politically important [[Papal States]]. After [[Italian unification]], the pope remains head of state of [[Vatican City]]. Furthermore, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell|Bishop of Urgell]] is ''[[ex officio]]'' one of the two [[Co-Princes of Andorra]]. In the [[Church of England]], the reigning monarch holds the title [[Fidei defensor#English usage|Defender of the Faith]] and acts as Supreme Governor of the Church of England, although this is purely a symbolic role.

====Islam====
[[File:Portrait Caliph Abdulmecid II.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abdulmecid II]] is the [[List of Caliphs|150th]] and last [[Caliph of Islam]] from [[Ottoman dynasty]]]]
During the [[History of Islam|early period of Islam]], [[caliph]]s were spiritual and temporal absolute successors of the Prophet [[Mohammed]]. Various political Muslim leaders since have styled themselves ''Caliph'' and served as dynastic heads of state, sometimes in addition to another title, such as the [[Ottoman Sultan]]. Historically, some [[Theocracy|theocratic]] Islamic states known as ''[[imamates]]'' have been led by [[imam]]s as head of state, such as in what is now [[Oman]], [[Yemen]], and [[Saudi Arabia]].

In the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]], at present [[Ali Khamenei]] serves as [[List of heads of state of Iran|head of state]]. The [[Aga Khan]]s, a unique dynasty of temporal/religious leadership, leading an offshoot of [[Shia Islam]] in Central and South Asia, once ranking among British India's [[princely state]]s, continue to the present day.

====Hinduism====
In [[Hinduism]], certain dynasties adopted a title expressing their positions as "servant" of a patron deity of the state, but in the sense of a [[viceroy]] under an absentee [[god-king]], ruling "in the name of" the patron god(ess), such as [[Patmanabha Dasa]] (servant of Vishnu) in the case of the [[Maharaja]] of [[Travancore]].

====Buddhism====
From the time of the [[5th Dalai Lama]] until the political retirement of the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in 2011, Dalai Lamas were both political and spiritual leaders ("god-king") of [[Tibet]].

[[Outer Mongolia]], the former homeland of the imperial dynasty of [[Genghis Khan]], was another [[Tibetan Buddhist|lamaist]] theocracy from 1585, using various styles, such as [[tulku]]. The establishment of the [[Communism|Communist]] [[Mongolian People's Republic]] replaced this [[regime]] in 1924.

===City states and crowned republics===
* The [[polis]] in Greek Antiquity and the equivalent city states in the feudal era and later, (many in Italy, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the Moorish ''taifa'' in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], essentially tribal-type but urbanized regions throughout the world in the [[Maya civilization]], etc.) offer a wide spectrum of styles, either monarchic (mostly identical to homonyms in larger states) or republican, see [[Chief magistrate]].
* [[Doge]]s were elected by their Italian aristocratic republics from a patrician nobility, but "reigned" as sovereign dukes.
* The paradoxical term [[crowned republic]] refers to various state arrangements that combine "republican" and "monarchic" characteristics.
* The [[Netherlands]] historically had officials called [[stadholder]]s and [[stadholder-general|stadholders-general]], titles meaning "lieutenant" or "governor", originally for the [[Habsburg]] monarchs.

===Multiple or collective heads of state===

A collective head of state can exist in republics (internal complexity), e.g., nominal [[triumvirate]]s, the [[Directoire]], the seven-member [[Swiss Federal Council]] (where each member acts in turn as president for one year), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] with a three-member presidium from three different nations, [[San Marino]] with two "Captains-regent" which maintains the tradition of Italian medieval republics that had always had an even number of consuls.

In [[condominium (international law)|condominiums]], sovereignty is shared between two external powers, e.g., [[Andorra]] (president of [[France]] and bishop of [[Urgell]], [[Spain]], co-princes), and the former Anglo-French [[New Hebrides]] (each nation's head of state was represented by a high commissioner).

In the [[Roman Republic]] there were two heads of state, styled [[Consul]], both of whom alternated months of authority during their year in office, similarly there was an even number of supreme magistrates in the Italic republics of Ancient Age. In the [[History of Athens|Athenian Republic]] there were nine supreme magistrates, styled [[archons]]. In [[Carthage]] there were two supreme magistrates, styled kings or [[Shofet|suffetes]] (judges). In ancient [[Sparta]] there were two hereditary kings, belonging to two different dynasties. In the [[Soviet Union]] the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union|Central Executive Committee]] of the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]] (between 1922-1938) and later the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] (between 1938-1989) served as the [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|collective head of state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Alexander Armstrong|title=Ideology, Politics, and Government in the Soviet Union: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZH9nkBOxrZQC&amp;pg=PA165|year=1978|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-8191-5405-7|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II the Soviet model was subsequently adopted by almost all countries belonged to its [[Eastern Bloc|sphere of influence]]. [[Czechoslovakia]] remained the only country among them that retained an office of president as a form of a single head of state throughout this period, followed by [[Romania]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=F. J. Ferdinand Joseph Maria Feldbrugge|title=The distinctiveness of Soviet law|url=https://books.google.sk/books?id=E7OJPKABUXwC&amp;pg=PA23|year=1987|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-247-3576-9|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Such arrangements are not to be confused with supranational entities which are not states and are not defined by a common monarchy but may (or not) have a symbolic, essentially protocollary, titled highest office, e.g., [[Head of the Commonwealth]] (held by the British crown, but not legally reserved for it) or 'Head of the Arab Union' (14 February - 14 July 1958, held by the Hashemite [[King of Iraq]], during its short-lived Federation with Jordan, its Hashemite sister-realm).

The [[National Government of the Republic of China]], established in 1928, had a panel of about 40 people as collective head of state.  Though beginning that year, a provisional constitution made the [[Kuomintang]] the [[One-party system|sole government party]] and the National Government bound to the instructions of the Central Executive Committee of that party.

===Unique cases and titles===
Though [[president]] and various monarchichal titles are most commonly used for heads of state, in some nationalistic regimes, the leader adopts, formally or de facto, a unique style simply meaning "leader" in the national language, e.g., Germany's single [[NSDAP|national socialist party chief]] and combined head of state and government, [[Adolf Hitler]], as the ''[[Führer]]'' between 1934 and 1945.

In 1959, when former [[United Kingdom|British]] crown colony [[Singapore]] gained self-government, it adopted the Malay style ''[[Yang di-Pertuan Negara]]'' (literally means "head of state" in [[Malay language|Malay]]) for its governor (the actual head of state remained the British monarch). The second and last incumbent of the office, [[Yusof bin Ishak]], kept the style at 31 August 1963 unilateral declaration of independence and after 16 September 1963 accession to [[Malaysia]] as a state (so now as a constituent part of the federation, a non-sovereign level). After its expulsion from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, Singapore became a sovereign [[republic within the Commonwealth|Commonwealth republic]] and installed Yusof bin Ishak as its first President.

In 1959 after the resignation of [[Vice President of Indonesia]] [[Mohammad Hatta]], [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Sukarno]] abolished the position and title of vice president, assuming the positions of Prime Minister and Head of Cabinet. He also proclaimed himself [[president for life]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Presiden Seumur Hidup Panglima Tertinggi''; "''panglima''" meaning "commander or martial figurehead", "''tertinggi''" meaning "highest"; roughly translated to English as "Supreme Commander of the Revolution"). He was praised as "''Paduka Yang Mulia''", a [[Malay titles|Malay honorific]] originally given to kings; Sukarno awarded himself titles in that fashion due to his noble ancestry.

There are also a few nations in which the exact title and definition of the office of head of state have been vague. During the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]], following the downfall of [[Liu Shaoqi]], who was [[Chairman of the People's Republic of China]], no successor was named, so the duties of the head of state were transferred collectively to the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]. This situation was later changed: the Head of State of the PRC is now the [[President of the People's Republic of China]].

In North Korea, the late [[Kim Il-sung]] was named "[[Eternal President]]" 4 years after his death and the [[President of North Korea|presidency was abolished]]. As a result, some of the duties previously held by the President are constitutionally delegated to the [[Supreme People's Assembly#President|Chairman]] of the [[Supreme People's Assembly#Presidium|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]], who performs some of the roles of a [[Head of State]], such as accrediting foreign ambassadors and undertaking overseas visits. However, the symbolic role of a Head of State is generally performed by [[Kim Jong-un]], who as the [[Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea|leader of the party]] and [[Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army|military]], is the [[Supreme Leader of North Korea|most powerful person]] in North Korea.

There is debate as to whether [[Samoa]] was an [[elective monarchy]] or an [[Aristocracy|aristocratic republic]], given the comparative ambiguity of the title ''[[O le Ao o le Malo]]'' and the nature of the head of state's office.

In some states the office of head of state is not expressed in a specific title reflecting that role, but constitutionally awarded to a post of another formal nature. Thus in March 1979 Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]], who kept absolute power (until [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|his overthrow]] in 2011 referred to as  "Guide of the Revolution"), after ten years as combined Head of State and Head of government of the Libyan ''[[Jamahiriya]]'' ("state of the masses"), styled Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, formally transferred both qualities to the General secretaries of the General People's Congress (comparable to a Speaker) respectively to a Prime Minister, in political reality both were his creatures.

Sometimes a head of state assumes office as a state becomes legal and political reality, before a formal title for the highest office is determined; thus in the since 1 January 1960 independent republic [[Cameroon]] (''Cameroun'', a former French colony), the first President, [[Ahmadou Babatoura Ahidjo]], was at first not styled ''président'' but 'merely' known as ''chef d'état'' - (French 'head of state') until 5 May 1960. In [[Uganda]], [[Idi Amin]] the military leader after the coup of 25 January 1971 was formally styled ''military head of state'' till 21 February 1971, only from then on regular (but unconstitutional, not elected) president.

In certain cases a special style is needed to accommodate imperfect statehood, e.g., the title ''[[Sardar-i-Riyasat]]'' was used in Kashmir after its accession to India, and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] leader, [[Yasser Arafat]], was styled the first "President of the [[Palestinian National Authority]]" in 1994. In 2008, the same office was restyled as "[[President of the State of Palestine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=PLO body elects Abbas 'President of Palestine'|newspaper=Khaleej Times Online|date=24 November 2008|archivedate=8 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608080641/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/darticlen.asp?xfile=data%2Fmiddleeast%2F2008%2FNovember%2Fmiddleeast_November480.xml&amp;section=middleeast|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/darticlen.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2008/November/middleeast_November480.xml&amp;section=middleeast|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legitimacy==
The position of head of state can be established in different ways, and with different sources of legitimacy.

===By fiction or fiat===
Power can come from force, but formal [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] is often established, even if only by fictitious claims of continuity (e.g., a forged claim of descent from a previous [[dynasty]]). There have been cases of sovereignty granted by deliberate act, even when accompanied by [[order of succession|orders of succession]] (as may be the case in a dynastic split). Such grants of sovereignty are usually forced, as is common with [[self-determination]] granted after [[Nationalism|nationalist]] revolts. This occurred with the last [[Attalid]] king of Hellenistic [[Pergamon]], who by testament left his realm to Rome to avoid a disastrous conquest.

===By divine appointment===
Under a theocracy, perceived divine status translated into earthly authority under [[divine law]]. This can take the form of supreme divine authority above the state's, granting a tool for political influence to a [[priest]]hood. In this way, the [[Amun]] priesthood reversed the reforms of Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] after his death. The division of theocratic power can be disputed, as happened between the Pope and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in the [[investiture]] conflict when the temporal power sought to control key clergy nominations in order to guarantee popular support, and thereby his own legitimacy, by incorporating the formal ceremony of [[unction]] during [[coronation]].

===By social contract===
The notion of a [[social contract]] holds that the nation—either the whole people or the [[:wikt:electorate|electorate]]—gives a mandate, through acclamation or [[election]].

===By constitution===
Individual heads of state may acquire their position by virtue of a [[Constitution#Distribution of sovereignty|constitution]]. An example includes SFR [[Yugoslavia]] whose Constitution from 1974, article 333, stated that Federal Assembly can appoint namely [[Josip Broz Tito]] as the President of Republic without time limitation.&lt;ref&gt;https://hr.wikisource.org/wiki/Ustav_Socijalisti%C4%8Dke_Federativne_Republike_Jugoslavije_(1974.)#Glava_III_PREDSJEDNIK_REPUBLIKE&lt;/ref&gt;

===By hereditary succession===
[[File:Firekonger.jpg|thumb|Four generations of [[List of Danish Monarchs|Danish kings]] in 1903: [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] (left), [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian (X)]] (back), [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Frederick (VIII)]] (right), and [[Frederick IX of Denmark|Frederick (IX)]] (front)]]

The position of a monarch is usually [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary]], but in [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], there are usually restrictions on the incumbent's exercise of powers and prohibitions on the possibility of choosing a successor by other means than by birth. In a hereditary monarchy, the position of monarch is inherited according to a statutory or customary [[order of succession]], usually within one [[royal family]] tracing its origin through a historical [[dynasty]] or bloodline. This usually means that the heir to the throne is known well in advance of becoming monarch to ensure a smooth succession. However, many cases of uncertain succession in European history have often led to [[War of succession|wars of succession]].

[[Primogeniture]], in which the eldest child of the monarch is first in line to become monarch, is the most common system in hereditary monarchy. The order of succession is usually affected by rules on gender. Historically "agnatic primogeniture" or "patrilineal primogeniture" was favoured, that is inheritance according to seniority of birth among the sons of a monarch or [[paterfamilias|head of family]], with sons and their male issue inheriting before brothers and their issue, and [[patrilineality|male-line]] males inheriting before females of the male line.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite web| last = Murphy| first = Michael Dean| title = A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts| url = http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm| accessdate = 5 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same as semi-Salic primogeniture. Complete exclusion of females from [[dynasty|dynastic]] succession is commonly referred to as application of the [[Salic law]] (see ''[[Terra salica]]'').

Before primogeniture was enshrined in European law and tradition, kings would often secure the succession by having their successor (usually their eldest son) crowned during their own lifetime, so for a time there would be two kings in [[coregency]] – a senior king and a junior king.  Examples include [[Henry the Young King]] of England and the early [[House of Capet|Direct Capetians]] in France.

Sometimes, however, primogeniture can operate through the female line. In some systems a female may rule as monarch only when the male line dating back to a common ancestor is exhausted.  In 1980, [[Sweden]], by rewriting its [[Swedish Act of Succession|1810 Act of Succession]], became the first European monarchy to declare equal (full cognatic) primogeniture, meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne.&lt;ref name="sweden as"&gt;[http://www.riksdagen.se/Global/dokument/dokument/laws/the-act-of-succession-2012.pdf Swedish Act of Succession (English Translation as of 2012)], The [[Riksdag]]. Retrieved on 28 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other European monarchies (such as the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990 and [[Belgium]] in 1991) have since followed suit. Similar reforms [[2011 proposals to change the rules of royal succession in the Commonwealth realms|were proposed in 2011]] for the [[United Kingdom]] and the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, which came into effect in 2015 after having been approved by all of the affected nations. Sometimes [[religion]] is affected; under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] all [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and all persons who have married Roman Catholics are ineligible to be the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] and are skipped in the order of succession.

In some monarchies there may be liberty for the incumbent, or some body convening after his or her demise, to choose from eligible members of the [[Royal family|ruling house]], often limited to [[Legitimate child|legitimate]] descendants of the dynasty's founder. Rules of succession may be further limited by [[state religion]], residency, [[Royal intermarriage|equal marriage]] or even permission from the [[legislature]].

Other hereditary systems of succession included [[tanistry]], which is semi-elective and gives weight to merit and [[Agnatic seniority]].  In some monarchies, such as [[King of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother, and only after that to the monarch's children (agnatic seniority).

===By election===
Election usually is the constitutional way to choose the head of state of a republic, and some monarchies, either directly through popular election, indirectly by members of the legislature or of a special college of [[Indirect election|electors]] (such as the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] in the [[United States]]), or as an exclusive prerogative. Exclusive prerogative allows the heads of states of constituent monarchies of a federation to choose the head of state for the federation among themselves, as in the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Malaysia]]. The Pope, head of state of Vatican City, is chosen by previously appointed [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] under 80 years of age from among themselves in a [[papal conclave]].

===By appointment===
A head of state can be empowered to designate his successor, such as [[Lord Protector of the Commonwealth]] [[Oliver Cromwell]], who was succeeded by his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]].

===By force or revolution===
A head of state may seize power by force or [[revolution]]. This is not the same as the use of force to ''maintain'' power, as is practiced by [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] or [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] rulers. Dictators often use democratic titles, though some proclaim themselves monarchs. Examples of the latter include Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and King [[Zog of Albania]]. In Spain, general [[Francisco Franco]] adopted the formal title ''Jefe del Estado'', or Chief of State, and established himself as [[regent]] for a vacant monarchy. Uganda's [[Idi Amin]] was one of several who named themselves [[President for Life]].

===By foreign imposition===
A foreign power can establishing a branch of their own dynasty, or one friendly to their interests. This was the outcome of the [[Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743)|Russo-Swedish War from 1741 to 1743]] where the [[Elizabeth of Russia|Russian Empress]] made the imposition of her relative [[Adolf Frederick of Sweden|Adolf Frederick]] as the heir to the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Swedish Throne]], to succeed [[Frederick I of Sweden|Frederick I]] who lacked [[Legitimate child|legitimate]] issue, as a peace condition.

===Loss===
Apart from violent overthrow, a head of state's position can be lost in several ways, including death, another by expiration of the constitutional term of office, [[abdication]], or resignation. In some cases, an abdication cannot occur unilaterally, but comes into effect only when approved by an act of parliament, as in the case of British King [[Edward VIII]]. The post can also be abolished by constitutional change; in such cases, an incumbent may be allowed to finish his or her term. Of course, a head of state position will cease to exist if the state itself does.

Heads of state generally enjoy widest inviolability, although some states allow [[impeachment]], or a similar constitutional procedure by which the highest legislative or judicial authorities are empowered to revoke the head of state's mandate on exceptional grounds. This may be a common crime, a political sin, or an act by which he or she violates such provisions as an established religion mandatory for the monarch. By similar procedure, an original mandate may be declared invalid.

==Former heads of state==
[[File:Berlin Nationaldenkmal Kaiser Wilhelm 1900.jpg|thumb|The National Monument to [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]] in Berlin, Germany, dedicated 1897, nearly 10 years after his death. The monument was destroyed by the communist government in 1950.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/archiv/ausstellungen/begas/en/das_nationaldenkmal_fuer_kaiser_wilhelm_i_in_berlin.html|title=Deutsches Historisches Museum Berlin - Reinhold Begas - Monuments for the German Empire - Exhibition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

[[Effigy|Effigies]], [[memorial]]s and [[monument]]s of former heads of state can be designed to represent the history or aspirations of a state or its people, such as the equestrian bronze sculpture of [[National Kaiser Wilhelm Monument|Kaiser Wilhelm I]], first Emperor of a unified Germany&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; erected in Berlin at the end of the nineteenth century; or the [[Victoria Memorial]] erected in front of [[Buckingham Palace]] London, commemorating Queen Victoria and her reign (1837–1901), and unveiled in 1911 by her grandson, King [[George V]]; or the [[Victoria Memorial (India)|monument]], placed in front of the Victoria Memorial Hall, Kolkata (Calcutta) (1921), commemorating Queen Victoria's reign as [[Empress of India]] from 1876.&lt;ref&gt;''[[George Frampton|Frampton's]] Jubilee Monument for Queen Victoria'', image with dog to show scale.[http://www.victorianweb.org/sculpture/frampton/7.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Another, twentieth century, example is the [[Mount Rushmore]] National Memorial, a group sculpture constructed (1927–1941) on a conspicuous skyline in the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]] ([[List of states and territories of the United States|40th state of the Union, 1889]]), in the [[midwestern United States]], representing the territorial expansion of the United States in the first 130 years from its founding, which is promoted as the "Shrine of [[Democracy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelsd.com/Attractions/Mount-Rushmore|title=Mount Rushmore National Memorial|work=TravelSouthDakota.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/mount-rushmore#|title=Mount Rushmore|work=HISTORY.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal influence or privileges===
Former Presidents of the United States, while holding no political powers [[List of Latin phrases (P)#per se|per se]], sometimes continue to exert influence in national and world affairs.

A monarch may retain his style and certain prerogatives after abdication, as did King [[Leopold III of Belgium]], who left the throne to his son after winning a referendum which allowed him to retain a full royal household deprived him of a constitutional or representative role. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] transformed the Italian principality of [[Elba]], where he was imprisoned, into a miniature version of his First Empire, with most trappings of a sovereign monarchy, until his ''[[Hundred Days|Cent Jours]]'' escape and reseizure of power in France convinced his opponents, reconvening the [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna Congress]] in 1815, to revoke his gratuitous privileges and send him to die in [[exile]] on barren [[Saint Helena]].

By tradition, deposed monarchs who have not freely abdicated continue to use their monarchical titles as a [[Courtesy title|courtesy]] for the rest of their lives. Hence, even after [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] ceased to be ''[[King of the Hellenes]]'', it is still common to refer to the deposed king and his family as if they were still on the throne, as many European royal courts and households do in guest lists at royal weddings, as in [[Wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling|Sweden in 2010]], [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|Britain in 2011]] and [[Wedding of Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and Countess Stéphanie de Lannoy|Luxembourg in 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/wedding/theweddingday/stockholmcathedral/guestsattheweddingceremony.4.40e05eec12926f2630480001312.html Guests at the wedding ceremony: Wedding between Crown Princess Victoria and Mr Daniel Westling on Saturday 19 June 2010, 3.30 p.m., at Stockholm Cathedral], [[Royal Court of Sweden]].

The former king brought this issue, along with property ownership issues, before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for alleged violations of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but lost with respect to the name issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-4238 THE FORMER KING CONSTANTINOS OF GREECE AND 8 MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY v.

However, some other states have no problem with deposed monarchs being referred to by their former title, and even allow them to travel internationally on the state's [[Passport#Full passports|diplomatic passport]].

In the Italian constitution provides that after the period sent the President of the Republic takes the title President Emeritus of the Italian Republic is also a senator for life, and enjoys immunity, flight status and official residences certain privileges.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11219">A '''heterarchy''' is a system of organization where the elements of the organization are unranked (non-hierarchical) or where they possess the potential to be ranked a number of different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crumley | first = Carole L. | title=Heterarchy and the Analysis of Complex Societies| journal = Archeological Papers of the American Anthropological Association | volume = 6 | issue = 1 |date=January 1995  | pages = 1–5 | url= http://www.sonoma.edu/users/p/purser/Anth590/crumley%20heterarchy.pdf| accessdate = 26 February 2014 | doi=10.1525/ap3a.1995.6.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions of the term vary among the disciplines: in social and information sciences, heterarchies are networks of elements in which each element shares the same "horizontal" position of power and authority, each playing a theoretically equal role. But in biological taxonomy, the requisite features of heterarchy involve, for example, a species sharing, with a species in a different family, a common ancestor which it does not share with members of its own family. This is theoretically possible under principles of "[[horizontal gene transfer]]".

A heterarchy may be parallel to a [[hierarchy]], subsumed to a hierarchy, or it may contain hierarchies; the two kinds of structure are not mutually exclusive. In fact, each level in a hierarchical system is composed of a potentially heterarchical group which contains its constituent elements.

The concept of heterarchy was first employed in a modern context by [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch|Warren McCulloch]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;McCulloch (1945), "A heterarchy of values determined by the topology of nervous nets", pp. 89-93&lt;/ref&gt; As Carole L. Crumley has summarised, "[h]e examined alternative cognitive structure(s), the collective organization of which he termed heterarchy. He demonstrated that the human brain, while reasonably orderly was not organized hierarchically. This understanding revolutionized the neural study of the brain and solved major problems in the fields of artificial intelligence and computer design."&lt;ref&gt;Crumley (1995), "Heterarchy and the analysis of complex societies", p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General principles==
In a group of related items, heterarchy is a state wherein any pair of items is likely to be related in two or more differing ways. Whereas hierarchies sort groups into progressively smaller categories and subcategories, heterarchies divide and unite groups variously, according to multiple concerns that emerge or recede from view according to perspective. Crucially, no one way of dividing a heterarchical system can ever be a totalizing or all-encompassing view of the system, each division is clearly partial, and in many cases, a partial division leads us, as perceivers, to a feeling of contradiction that invites a new way of dividing things. (But of course the next view is just as partial and temporary.) Heterarchy is a name for this state of affairs, and a description of a heterarchy usually requires ambivalent thought... a willingness to ambulate freely between unrelated perspectives.

However, because the requirements for a heterarchical system are not exactly stated, identifying a heterarchy through the use of archaeological materials can often prove to be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;O’Reilly, D.J.W. 2003. Further evidence of heterarchy in Bronze Age Thailand. Current Anthropology 44:300-306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of heterarchical conceptualizations include the [[Gilles Deleuze]]/[[Félix Guattari]] conceptions of [[deterritorialization]], [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizome]], and [[body without organs]].

==Information studies==
Numerous observers{{who|date=January 2015}} in the information sciences have argued that heterarchical structure processes more information more effectively than hierarchical design. An example of the potential effectiveness of heterarchy would be the rapid growth of the heterarchical [[Wikipedia]] project in comparison with the failed growth of the [[Nupedia]] project.&lt;ref&gt;Bruns (2008), ''Blogs, Wikipedia, Second Life and Beyond: From Production to Produsage'', pp. 108-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Heterarchy increasingly trumps hierarchy as complexity and rate of change increase.

Informational heterarchy can be defined as an organizational form somewhere between hierarchy and network that provides horizontal links that permit different elements of an organization to cooperate whilst individually optimizing different success criteria.  In an organizational context the value of heterarchy derives from the way in which it permits the legitimate valuation of multiple skills, types of knowledge or working styles without privileging one over the other. In information science, therefore, heterarchy, [[responsible autonomy]] and [[hierarchy]] are sometimes combined under the umbrella term [[Triarchy]].

This concept has also been applied to the field of [[archaeology]], where it has enabled researchers to better understand social complexity. For further reading see the works of Carole Crumley.

==Sociology and political theory==
Anthropologist [[Dmitri Bondarenko]] follows Carole Crumley in her definition of heterarchy as "the relation of elements to one another when they are unranked or when they possess the potential for being ranked in a number of different ways" and argues that it is therefore not strictly the opposite of hierarchy, but is rather the opposite of '''[[homoarchy]]''',&lt;ref&gt;Bondarenko (2005), "A homoarchic alternative to the homoarchic state", {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is itself defined as "the relation of elements to one another when they possess the potential for being ranked in one way only".&lt;ref&gt;Bondarenko, Grinin, Korotayev (2002), ""Alternative pathways of social evolution", p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David C. Stark]] has been contributing to developing the concept of heterarchy in the [[sociology of organizations]].

Political [[hierarchy|hierarchies]] and heterarchies are systems in which multiple dynamic power structures govern the actions of the system.  They represent different types of [[network (mathematics)|network]] structures that allow differing degrees of connectivity. In a ([[Tree structure|tree-structured]]) [[hierarchy]] every [[node (networking)|node]] is connected to at most one [[parent node]] and zero or more [[child node]]s. In a heterarchy, however, a node can be connected to any of its surrounding nodes without needing to go through or get permission from some other node.

Socially, a heterarchy distributes privilege and decision-making among participants, while a hierarchy assigns more power and privilege to the members high in the structure. In a systemic perspective, Gilbert Probst, Jean-Yves Mercier and others describe heterarchy as the flexibility of the formal relationships inside an organization.&lt;ref&gt;Probst, Mercier, et al. (1992), ''Organisation et management'' {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Domination and subordination links can be reversed and privileges can be redistributed in each situation, following the needs of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Joyce|editor1-last=Ehrenreich|editor1-first=Robert|title=Incorporating Heterarchy into Theory on Socio-Political Development: The case from Southeast Asia|journal=Heterarchy and the Analysis of Complex Societies|date=1995|pages=101–123|series=Archeological Papers of the American Anthropological Association Number 6|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A heterarchical network could be used to describe [[neuron]] connections or democracy, although there are clearly hierarchical elements in both.

The term heterarchy is used in conjunction with the concepts of [[holon (philosophy)|holon]]s and [[holarchy]] to describe individual [[system]]s at each level of a holarchy.

'''''House of Numbers: Anatomy of an Epidemic''''' is a 2009 documentary film directed, produced, and hosted by Brent Leung and described by him as an objective examination of the idea that HIV causes AIDS.&lt;ref name=Baywindows /&gt; The film argues that [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) is harmless and does not cause [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS), a position known as [[HIV/AIDS denialism|AIDS denialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Specter|first1=Michael|authorlink=Michael Specter|title=Denialism: How Irrational Thinking Harms the Planet and Threatens Our Lives|date=Oct 29, 2009|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780715639436|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J-VMNrt3JyIC&amp;pg=PT111&amp;dq=%22house+of+numbers%22+AIDS+denialism#v=onepage&amp;q=%22house%20of%20numbers%22%20AIDS%20denialism&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baywindows&gt;{{cite news | url = http://baywindows.com/crazy-house-90259 | work = [[Bay Windows]] | first = Ethan | last = Jacobs | date = April 22, 2009 | accessdate= September 8, 2009 | title = Crazy 'House'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pernicious/&gt; The film's claims of impartiality have been widely rejected by scientists, and the film's claims about HIV/AIDS have been dismissed as pseudoscience and [[conspiracy theory]] masquerading as even-handed examination.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lancet"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | title = House of Numbers | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | year = 2009 | pages = 735 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70316-0 | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2809%2970316-0/fulltext | author = Burki T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aaronovitch"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Conspiracy-Theory Theory.

A group of scientists interviewed for the film later complained that their comments had been misrepresented and taken out of context, and that the film promotes [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lancet"/&gt; The film also interviews [[Christine Maggiore]], a prominent AIDS denialist who later died after suffering from AIDS-related conditions.&lt;ref name="LACertificate"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aidstruth.org/news/2009/christine-maggiore-died-aids | title = Christine Maggiore died of AIDS | accessdate = 2011-02-01 | date = 2009-03-09 | publisher = AIDStruth.org | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110821045350/http://www.aidstruth.org/news/2009/christine-maggiore-died-aids | archivedate = 2011-08-21 | df =  }} [http://www.aidstruth.org/new/sites/default/files/maggiore-death-certificate.pdf Death certificate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103172503/http://www.aidstruth.org/new/sites/default/files/maggiore-death-certificate.pdf |date=2012-01-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and content ==
Leung has declined to discuss funding for the film except to state that funders came from "all over the world".&lt;ref name=Baywindows /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nville_Scene"&gt;{{cite news | first = Jim | last = Ridley | title = Controversy lingers after premiere of Nashville director's AIDS documentary | date = 2009-05-07 | url = http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/controversy-lingers-after-premiere-of-nashville-directors-aids-documentary/Content?oid=1200956 | work = [[Nashville Scene]] | accessdate = 2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Leung interviews a range of scientists and AIDS denialists, most notably [[Christine Maggiore]]. At the time of filming, Maggiore was HIV-positive and appeared healthy, despite her refusal to take [[anti-retroviral]] medication, which mainstream medicine uses to slow down the rate at which HIV destroys [[CD4+ T cells|CD4+ T-cells]]. As she said in the film, she refused to take the medication, and had not had her daughter, [[Eliza Jane Scovill]], tested, or provided her with medication, because she believed HIV did not cause AIDS. Rather, she believed that the medication itself caused AIDS. Maggiore's relative health, despite years of infection, is used by the film to support the idea that anti-retrovirals are unnecessary to combat, and may themselves cause, AIDS.

==Release and aftermath==
The film was screened at the multiple small film festivals, including the London Raindance film festival&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/oct/24/hiv-aids-link-denialist-spectator-events&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.houseofnumbers.com/site2/screenings.html&lt;/ref&gt; A panel discussion of the film at a [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] film festival was disrupted by Leung and other AIDS denialists in the audience, who attempted to shout down members of the panel with whom they disagreed.&lt;ref name="Baywindows"/&gt;

Both Maggiore and her daughter died of AIDS-related complications before the film's release, although their deaths are mentioned only in small print during the closing credits along with a claim that Maggiore's death was "unrelated to HIV."&lt;ref name="lancet"/&gt; Maggiore's daughter died in September 2005 of AIDS-related infections, although Maggiore rejected the cause of death and argued that the coroner's report was politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ornstein|first1=Charles|last2=Costello|first2=Daniel|title=A Mother's Denial, a Daughter's Death|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/24/local/me-eliza24|accessdate=April 17, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Did HIV-Positive Mom's Beliefs Put Her Children at Risk?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/print?id=1386737|accessdate=April 17, 2015|work=ABC News|date=December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maggiore herself died in December 2008 from [[AIDS-defining clinical condition|AIDS-related opportunistic infections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christine Maggiore died of AIDS|url=http://www.aidstruth.org/news/2009/christine-maggiore-died-aids|accessdate=April 17, 2015|work=AIDStruth.org|date=March 9, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821045350/http://www.aidstruth.org/news/2009/christine-maggiore-died-aids|archivedate=August 21, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteen scientists interviewed in the film stated that their answers to Leung's questions were selectively [[Video editing|edited]] to convey a false sense that the scientific community disagrees on basic facts about HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="lancet"/&gt; Two interviewees, Neil Constantine and [[Robin Weiss]], cite examples supporting the allegation that Leung misrepresented their words in a "surely intentional" manner.&lt;ref name="WeissConstantine"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Aidstruth.org | title = Constantine and Weiss pinpoint misrepresentations | date = November 26, 2009 | accessdate = November 27, 2009 | url = http://www.aidstruth.org/features/2009/constantine-and-weiss}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brent Leung denied taking quotes out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-rivera/filmmaker-brent-leung-res_b_271521.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Jeff | last=Rivera | title=Filmmaker, Brent Leung Responds to Huffpo Blogger, Thomas DeLorenzo | date=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The film's promotion of AIDS denialism, a pseudoscientific movement implicated in thousands of deaths,&lt;ref name="guardian-mbeki"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[The Guardian]] | title = Mbeki Aids denial 'caused 300,000 deaths' | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/26/aids-south-africa | date = November 26, 2008 | first = Sarah | last = Boseley}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew criticism and anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nashvillescene.com/2009-04-30/film/for-the-nashville-film-festival-there-s-clearly-life-after-forty/ | work = [[Nashville Scene]] | first = Jim | last = Ridley | date = April 29, 2009 | accessdate = September 8, 2009 | title = For the Nashville Film Festival, there's clearly life after 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' characterized the film as "a weaselly support pamphlet for AIDS denialists", "willfully ignorant", and "a globe-trotting pseudo-investigation that should raise the hackles of anyone with even a glancing knowledge of the basic rules of reasoning."&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeanette |last= Catsoulis |title=AIDS Seen From a Different Angle  |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/09/04/movies/04house.html |work = [[New York Times]]  |date=4 September 2009  |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' cited the film as part of "this season's fashion in conspiracy theories."&lt;ref name="Aaronovitch"/&gt; The ''[[Portland Oregonian]]'' criticized Leung for "not being entirely honest with viewers," and decried the film's reliance on "selective editing, anomalies and anecdotes, unsupported conclusions...&amp;nbsp;and suppression of inconvenient facts."&lt;ref name="oregonian"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Portland Oregonian]] | publisher = OregonLive.com | first = Stan | last = Hall | title = 'House of Numbers' blurs facts on HIV | url = http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2010/01/review_house_of_numbers_blurs.html | date = January 21, 2010 | accessdate = May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction from the [[scientific community]] was similarly negative. ''[[The Lancet|Lancet Infectious Diseases]]'' criticized the film's arguments, calling them a "toxic combination of misrepresentation and sophistry."&lt;ref name="lancet"/&gt; AIDSTruth.org, a website created by HIV researchers to address AIDS denialism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohen J |title=HIV/AIDS.

In February 2014 several people involved with the film filed [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] notices against a [[YouTube]] science blogger named Myles Power, who had made a video series debunking claims made in the film.

'''Issue networks''' are an [[Business alliance|alliance]] of various [[interest group]]s and individuals who unite in order to promote a common cause or agenda in a way that influences [[Policy|government policy]]. Issue networks can be either domestic or international in scope depending on their collective goal. With the rise of the internet, many interest groups have turned to online resources, such as blogs and social media, to promote and spread their cause because of its low cost and high efficiency in outreach. An Issue network's tactics vary depending on their goals and purpose. In developed countries, issue networks often push for a change in policy within the government [[bureaucracy]]. An example includes the wide-ranging network of environmental groups and individuals who push for more environmental regulation in government policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rodrigues|first=Maria Guadalupe|year=2000|title=Environmental Protection Issue Networks in Amazonia|jstor=2692044|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=35|pages=125–153|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other issue networks may revolve around such controversial issues as abortion, gun ownership rights, and drug laws. In the most extreme circumstances issue networks may seek to achieve their means through violence, such as terrorist organizations looking to overthrow existing governments all together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/guideDesc.asp?catid=148&amp;type=issue|title=Issues-Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=www.discoverthenetworks.org|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S, the most common tactic of effective issue networks is the role they play in what is called Iron Triangles. This is the term used to describe the three way back and forth communication process between Congress, Bureaucracies, and the interest groups that make up an issue network where they discuss policy and agendas in order to compromise on solutions to satisfy each other's agendas.

== Iron triangles ==
[[Iron triangle (US politics)|Iron triangles]] are three-pronged relationships that are used between interest groups. Generally these interest groups are composed of businesses, congressional committees, and Federal agencies set to deal with a certain issue. These iron triangles do not have the general welfare of the public in mind, but are for the furthering of favorable policies for the interest group. For example, an iron triangle dealing with fossil fuels would be composed of a business or corporation dealing in fossil fuels, a congressional committee who oversees fossil fuel laws and regulations, and a fossil fuel Federal Agency which makes sure these laws are obeyed. However, iron triangles do not benefit the public, they only benefit the players within the iron triangle. Some cases these iron triangles not only benefit inside the ring, but often do so at the expense of the constituencies that Congress and these Federal bureaucracies are supposed to represent.

=== Iron triangles versus issue networks ===
Issue networks are not the same as iron triangles for several reasons. One of the main differences between iron triangles and issue networks is that issue networks are generally free-forming groups of people in the public sector who form a coalition together, not through a congressional committee, or a Federal Agency but are bound together to accomplish a task at hand. These groups, most often, once the goal has been accomplished either A, break up and only form if the issue is brought back up, or B, find another issue similar in scope which they want to tackle. Another difference between iron triangles and Issue networks is that sometimes they can be at antagonistic with one another. Referring back to the paragraph above, if we take an iron triangle issue network who wants to build a pipeline, an issue network can form as a group of citizens who oppose it. They may oppose it for various reasons, but what brings them together temporarily is to not allow it to be built. If the issue network is successful in blocking the fossil fuel pipeline, then the issue network may dissolve because the task has been accomplished. Another example is the case in regards to [,[environmental issue]] networks that disagree with the lax environmental standards pursued by private energy companies. It is also important to note often different Issue networks can also compete with one another, as in the case of pro-life and pro-choice sides of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Gais, Thomas L., Mark A. Peterson, and Jack L. Walker. "Interest Groups, Iron Triangles and Representative Institutions in American National Government." ''British Journal of Political Science'' 14, no. 2 (1984)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interest groups==
Interest groups are organizations that may be formed by constitutes of an issue network to help promote their cause. They usually focus on tactics of raising money to donate to political campaigns and [[lobbying]] politicians already elected into office. Forming these organizations are often the most effective way for an issue network to influence government policy. Without them, it can be hard for the members of issue networks to unite as a whole in order to effectively make their demands heard. Interest groups play an integral part of Iron Triangle networks. They act as the voice of the people in the constant communication between themselves, [[legislature]]s, and bureaucracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/interest-group.html|title=Interest Group|last=|first=|date=|website=www.buissnessdictionary.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==
From a stable policy community, through a period of substantial change under firm government control, to a densely populated and competitive environment composed of issue networks. In countries such as [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]], government is returning to a more interactive strategy regarding issue networks.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, S. (2016). The Governance of Markets, Sustainability and Supply. Toward a European Energy Policy. ''Journal of Contemporary European Research'', ''12''(1), 502-517.&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, group input is a vital component of the policy-making process, through that process bureaucratic expertise is built-up and maintained. The existence of knowledgeable government agencies is necessary to balance the demands of competing groups and thereby ensure greater stability of policy outcomes. For example, in Australia, higher education is a good example of how the government is listening to clientele groups (issue networks) less than they were in the past due to the complexity of universities and the higher education system.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, N. (1995). Policy Communities, Issue Networks and the Formulation of Australian Higher Education Policy. ''Higher Education,'' ''30''(3), 273-293.

''[[Dom (title)|Dom]]'' '''Joseph Nasi''' (or '''Nassi'''; also known as '''João Miques'''/'''Micas''' and '''Dom João Migas Mendes''' in a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] variant, '''Giuseppe Nasi''' in Italian, and as '''Yasef Nassi''' in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]; 1524, [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] – 1579, [[Constantinople]]) was a [[Sephardi Jews|Portuguese Sephardi]] diplomat and administrator, member of the House of Mendes/[[Benveniste]], nephew of [[Dom (title)|Dona]] [[Gracia Mendes Nasi]], and an influential figure in the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the rules of both [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] and his son [[Selim II]]. He was a great benefactor of the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7lsVajEtaQ0C&amp;pg=PA218 Yosef Eisen (2004). Miraculous journey: a complete history of the Jewish people from creation to the present.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Court Jew]],&lt;ref&gt;Hillgarth, p.171&lt;/ref&gt; he was appointed the Lord of Tiberias,&lt;ref name="Pasachoff &amp; Littman, p.163"&gt;Pasachoff &amp; Littman, p.163&lt;/ref&gt; with the expressed aim of resettling Jews in [[Ottoman Syria]] and encouraging industry there; the attempt failed, and, later, he was appointed to the [[Duchy of the Archipelago|Duke of Naxos]].&lt;ref name="Freely, p.168"&gt;Freely, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Nasi also brought about war with the [[Republic of Venice]], at the end of which Venice lost the island of [[Cyprus]] to the Ottomans. After the death of Selim, he lost influence in the [[State organization of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Court]], but was allowed to keep his titles and pension for the remainder of his life.

==Early life==
Joao Micas, Yosef  Nasi was born in [[Portugal]] as a ''[[Marrano]]'' (practicing [[Judaism]] in secret), a son of the doctor Agostinho Micas (?-1525), a well known physician and professor at the [[University of Lisbon]]. A friend of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], nephew of the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] [[Spanish monarchy|King]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Pasachoff &amp; Littman, p.162"&gt;Pasachoff &amp; Littman, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped to [[Portugal]] after Charles decided to confiscate the Mendes fortune,&lt;ref name="Pasachoff &amp; Littman, p.162"/&gt; and, after the [[Portuguese Inquisition|Holy Inquisition]] began operating against Portuguese ''Marranos'' in 1546, moved to [[Antwerp]], in the [[Seventeen Provinces|Habsburg Netherlands]], with his aunt, Doña [[Gracia Mendes Nasi]]. He studied at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]],&lt;ref name="Pasachoff &amp; Littman, p.162"/&gt; but had to flee the Inquisition in 1547.&lt;ref name="Pasachoff &amp; Littman, p.162"/&gt; He then moved to [[Kingdom of France|France]] and later to [[Venice]], before finally leaving for the Ottoman realm in 1554, where he married Ana (Reyna) Mendes, the daughter of his aunt [[Gracia Mendes Nasi]].&lt;ref name="Pasachoff &amp; Littman, p.162"/&gt;

==Ottoman Court==
When he arrived in Constantinople together with his aunt [[Gracia Mendes Nasi]], Nasi made a fortunate decision in supporting the future sultan Selim II, against his rival Bayezid; as a result, he was favored by the [[Seraglio]], and eventually became a high ranking diplomat and minister.&lt;ref name="Pasachoff &amp; Littman, p.162"/&gt;

Due to his trading connections in Europe, he was able to exercise great influence on Ottoman foreign policy.&lt;ref name="Pasachoff &amp; Littman, p.163"/&gt; Among his achievements were negotiating peace with [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] and influencing the new election of the  [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish king]]. He was awarded the [[monopoly]] of the [[beeswax]] trade with Poland, and of the wine trade with [[Moldavia]], and maneuvered in the latter country to keep [[List of rulers of Moldavia|princes]] favorable to his policies in power.  In 1561, Nasi backed [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid]] to rule as ''[[Despotate|despot]]'', supported [[Alexandru Lăpuşneanu]]'s return to the throne in place of [[Ştefan Tomşa]] (1564), and ultimately endorsed [[Ion Vodă cel Cumplit]] (1572);&lt;ref name="Rezachevici, p.61"&gt;Rezachevici, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; he was himself considered a suitable choice for ''[[hospodar]]'' of either Moldavia or [[Wallachia]] in 1571, but Selim II rejected the proposal.&lt;ref name="Rezachevici, p.61"/&gt;

During the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–1573)|war between the Ottomans and the Republic of Venice]], Nasi's negotiations with the Jewish community in Venetian-ruled [[Cyprus]] were uncovered, and, as a result, the Jewish population of [[Famagusta]] (with the exception of Jews who were natives of the city) was expelled in June, 1568 (''see [[History of the Jews in Cyprus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Urman &amp; McCracken Flesher, p.62&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that he intended parts of Cyprus to be a Jewish colony and encouraged the Ottoman annexation of Cyprus in the war to that end; he was granted a coat of arms by Selim that indicated he would be given  [[Viceroy|viceregal rank]] in that colony.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p.154&lt;/ref&gt; Nasi's relative [[Abraham Bene|Abraham Benvenist]][[Abraham Beneviste|e]] (''Righetto Marrano'') was arrested in 1570, on charges of having set fire to the [[Venetian Arsenal]] on Nasi's instigation.&lt;ref&gt;Urman &amp; McCracken Flesher, p.63&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining contacts with [[William the Silent]],&lt;ref&gt;Bulut, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; Nasi encouraged the [[Netherlands]] to revolt against Spain, a major adversary of the Ottoman Empire (the rebellion was ultimately carried out by the [[Union of Utrecht]], as the start of the [[Eighty Years' War]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bulut, p.112; Hillgarth, p.171; Pasachoff &amp; Littman, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; For this and other achievements, he was appointed by Selim to become the Duke of [[Duchy of the Archipelago|Naxos]]; he also later became the Count of [[Andros]]. Represented locally by one Francesco Coronello,&lt;ref name="Freely, p.168"/&gt; Nasi mainly ruled the Duchy from his palace of ''[[Belvedere, Turkey|Belvedere]]'', where he also maintained his own [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[printing press]], which was kept by his wife, Doña Reyna, after Joseph's death.

==Settling Tiberias==
Joseph Nasi is best known to history for his attempt to resettle the towns of [[Tiberias]] and [[Safed]] in 1561.&lt;ref name="Gordon, p.209; Stillman, p.52"&gt;Gordon, p.209; Stillman, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first person to attempt to settle Jews in the cities of what was then [[Southern Syria]] by practical means, as opposed to waiting for the [[Messiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasi secured a grant giving ruling authority from the Sultan, and, with the assistance of [[Joseph ben Adruth]],&lt;ref name="Gordon, p.209"&gt;Gordon, p.209&lt;/ref&gt; rebuilt the walls and the town. He also attempted to turn it into a textile ([[silk]]) center by planting [[Mulberry|mulberry trees]] and encouraging craftsmen to move there.&lt;ref name="Gordon, p.209"/&gt; Arrangements were made for Jews to move from the [[Papal States]], but, when the Ottomans and the Republic of Venice went to war, the plan was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Gordon, p.209; Stillman, p.52"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
Nasi is a character in [[Wu Ming#Altai|Altai]] by [[Wu Ming]].

=== Early history ===
In 1613, the town of Kuwait was founded in modern-day [[Kuwait City]]. In 1716, the [[Bani Utub]] settled in Kuwait, which at this time was inhabited by a few [[fishermen]] and primarily functioned as a [[fishing village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Mohammad Khalid A. |last=Al-Jassar |type=PhD thesis |url=http://gradworks.umi.com/33/63/3363409.html|title=Constancy and Change in Contemporary Kuwait City: The Socio-cultural Dimensions of the Kuwait Courtyard and Diwaniyya |publisher=The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee |date=May 2009 |page=64 |isbn=978-1-109-22934-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century, Kuwait prospered and rapidly became the principal commercial center for the transit of goods between [[India]], [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Baghdad]] and [[Arabia]].&lt;ref name=sail&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVBjiaTROe8C&amp;pg=PA222 |title=Shadows on the Sand: The Memoirs of Sir Gawain Bell |first=Gawain, Sir |last=Bell |page=222 |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-905838-92-2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412213300/https://books.google.com/books?id=qVBjiaTROe8C&amp;pg=PA222 |archivedate=12 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TVfaAAAAMAAJ |title=ʻAlam-i Nisvāṉ |volume=2 |issue=1–2 |publisher=University of Karachi |date=1995 |page=18 |quote=Kuwait became an important trading port for import and export of goods from India, Africa and Arabia. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224093441/https://books.google.com/books?id=TVfaAAAAMAAJ |archivedate=24 February 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 1700s, Kuwait had already established itself as the major trading route from the Persian Gulf to [[Aleppo]].&lt;ref name=kw /&gt;

The Sheikhdom of Kuwait became a British protectorate in 1899 (until 1961) after the [[Anglo-Kuwaiti Agreement of 1899]] was signed between Sheikh [[Mubarak Al-Sabah|Mubarak Al Sabah]] and the British government in India due to severe threats to Kuwait's independence from the Ottoman Empire.

Following the [[Kuwait–Najd War]] of 1919–20, [[Ibn Saud]] imposed a trade blockade against Kuwait from the years 1923 until 1937.&lt;ref name=do&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Mohammad Khalid A. |last=Al-Jassar |type=PhD thesis |url=http://gradworks.umi.com/33/63/3363409.html|title=Constancy and Change in Contemporary Kuwait City: The Socio-cultural Dimensions of the Kuwait Courtyard and Diwaniyya |publisher=The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee |date=May 2009| page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the Saudi economic and military attacks on Kuwait was to annex as much of Kuwait's territory as possible. At the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair conference]] in 1922, the boundaries of Kuwait and [[Najd]] were set; as a result of British interference, Kuwait had no representative at the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair conference]]. Ibn Saud persuaded [[Percy Cox|Sir Percy Cox]] to give him two-thirds of Kuwait's territory. More than half of Kuwait was lost due to Uqair. After the Uqair conference, Kuwait was still subjected to a Saudi economic blockade and intermittent Saudi [[raid (military)|raiding]].

The [[National Assembly (Kuwait)|National Assembly]] is the [[legislature]] and has oversight authority.

[[Executive power]] is executed by the government. The Emir appoints the prime minister, who in turn chooses the ministers comprising the government. According to the constitution, at least one minister has to be an elected MP from the parliament.

=== Military ===
The [[Military of Kuwait]] traces its original roots to the Kuwaiti cavalrymen and infantrymen that used to protect Kuwait and its wall since the early 1900s. These cavalrymen and infantrymen formed the defense and security forces in metropolitan areas; charged with protecting outposts outside the wall of Kuwait.

The Military of Kuwait consists of several joint defense forces. The governing bodies are the [[Ministry of Defense (Kuwait)|Kuwait Ministry of Defense]], the [[Ministry of Interior (Kuwait)|Kuwait Ministry of Interior]], the [[Kuwait National Guard]] and the Kuwait Fire Service Directorate. The [[Emir of Kuwait]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of all defense forces by default. Even in the most adverse of all times such as a war, even the military is not allowed to make a single move without the Emir's consent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== National parks ===
At present, there are five [[protected areas]] in Kuwait recognized by the [[IUCN]]. In response to Kuwait becoming the [[List of parties to the Ramsar Convention|169th signatory]] of the [[Ramsar Convention]], Bubyan island's Mubarak al-Kabeer reserve was designated as the country's first Wetland of International Importance.&lt;ref name=ramsar /&gt; The 50,948&amp;nbsp;ha reserve consists of small lagoons and shallow [[Saltmarsh|salt marshes]] and is important as a stop-over for migrating birds on two migration routes.&lt;ref name=ramsar /&gt; The reserve is home to the world's largest breeding colony of [[crab-plover]].&lt;ref name=ramsar&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramsar|title=Kuwait becomes Ramsar state|url=http://www.birdguides.com/webzine/article.asp?a=5210|website=BirdGuides|accessdate=7 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219121906/http://www.birdguides.com/webzine/article.asp?a=5210|archivedate=19 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biodiversity ===
{{Main article|List of birds of Kuwait|List of mammals of Kuwait}}
More than 363 species of birds were recorded in Kuwait, 18 species of which breed in the country.&lt;ref name=bsc-eoc&gt;{{cite web|last=Lepage|first=Denis|url=http://www.bsc-eoc.org/avibase/avibase.jsp?region=kw&amp;pg=checklist&amp;list=clements|title=Checklist of birds of Kuwait|work=Bird Checklists of the World|publisher=Avibase|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929203751/http://www.bsc-eoc.org/avibase/avibase.jsp?region=kw&amp;pg=checklist&amp;list=clements|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuwait is situated at the crossroads of several major bird migration routes and between two and three million birds pass each year.&lt;ref name=natstrat&gt;{{cite web|title=National Biodiversity Strategy for the State of Kuwait|url=http://www.birdguides.com/webzine/article.asp?a=5210|page=12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219121906/http://www.birdguides.com/webzine/article.asp?a=5210|archivedate=19 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marshes in northern Kuwait and Jahra have become increasingly important as a refuge for passage migrants.&lt;ref name=natstrat /&gt; Kuwaiti islands are important breeding areas for four species of [[tern]] and the [[socotra cormorant]].&lt;ref name=natstrat /&gt;

Kuwait's marine and littoral ecosystems contain the bulk of the country's biodiversity heritage.&lt;ref name=natstrat /&gt; Twenty eight species of mammal are found in Kuwait; animals such as gerboa, desert rabbits and [[hedgehog]]s are common in the desert.&lt;ref name=natstrat /&gt; Large carnivores, such as the [[wolf]], [[caracal]] and [[jackal]], are not found.&lt;ref name=natstrat /&gt; Among the endangered mammalian species are the [[red fox]] and [[wild cat]].&lt;ref name=natstrat /&gt; Causes for wildlife extinction are habitat destruction and extensive unregulated hunting.&lt;ref name=natstrat /&gt; Forty reptile species have been recorded although none are endemic to Kuwait.&lt;ref name=natstrat /&gt;

===Water and sanitation===
[[File:Kuwait Water Towers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Kuwait Water Towers]] in Kuwait City]]
Kuwait does not have any permanent rivers. It does have some [[wadi]]s, the most notable of which is [[Wadi Al-Batin]] which forms the border between Kuwait and [[Iraq]].

Kuwait relies on water [[desalination]] as a primary source of fresh water for drinking and domestic purposes.&lt;ref name=scidi /&gt;&lt;ref name=fao /&gt; There are currently more than six desalination plants.&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/w4356e/w4356e0g.htm|title=Irrigation in the near east region in figures|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|accessdate=12 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011071303/http://www.fao.org/docrep/w4356e/w4356e0g.htm|archivedate=11 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuwait was the first country in the world to use desalination to supply water for large-scale domestic use. The history of desalination in Kuwait dates back to 1951 when the first distillation plant was commissioned.&lt;ref name=scidi&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mohamed|last=F. Hamoda|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916401002594 |title=Desalination and water resource management in Kuwait|publisher=Science Direct|date=September 2001|doi=10.1016/S0011-9164(01)00259-4|volume=138|journal=Desalination|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Kuwaiti government commissioned the Swedish engineering company of VBB ([[Sweco]]) to develop and implement a plan for a modern [[water-supply system]] for Kuwait City. The company built [[Kuwait Water Towers|five groups of water towers]], thirty-one towers total, designed by its chief architect [[Sune Lindström]], called "the mushroom towers". For a sixth site, the Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh [[Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah|Jaber Al-Ahmed]], wanted a more spectacular design. This last group, known as [[Kuwait Towers]], consists of three towers, two of which also serve as water towers.&lt;ref&gt;Kultermann 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Water from the desalination facility is pumped up to the tower. The thirty-three towers have a standard capacity of 102,000 cubic meters of water. "The Water Towers" (Kuwait Tower and the Kuwait Water Towers) were awarded the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] (1980 Cycle).&lt;ref&gt;Aga Khan Award&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuwait's fresh water resources are limited to groundwater, desalinated seawater, and treated wastewater effluents.&lt;ref name=scidi /&gt; There are three major municipal wastewater treatment plants.&lt;ref name=scidi /&gt; Most water demand is currently satisfied through seawater desalination plants.&lt;ref name=scidi /&gt;&lt;ref name=fao /&gt; Sewage disposal is handled by a national sewage network that covers 98% of facilities in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatona.net/CMS/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1560&amp;Itemid=84&amp;lang=en|title=Regulations of Wastewater Treatment and Reuse in Kuwait|publisher=Beatona|accessdate=12 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219121906/http://www.beatona.net/CMS/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1560&amp;Itemid=84&amp;lang=en|archivedate=19 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuwait is a major source of foreign economic assistance to other states through the [[Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development]], an autonomous state institution created in 1961 on the pattern of international development agencies. In 1974, the fund's lending mandate was expanded to include all [[developing countries]] in the world.

In 2018 Kuwait enacted certain measures to regulate foreign labor. Citing security concerns, workers from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] will be subject to heightened scrutiny when applying for entry visas, and an outright ban was being imposed on the entry of domestic workers from [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Citing Security Concerns, Kuwait Bans Entry to These Nationalities| work = Al Bawaba| accessdate = 2018-11-08| date = 2018-11-08| url = https://www.albawaba.com/business/citing-security-concerns-kuwait-bans-entry-these-nationalities-1210600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers from [[Bangladesh]] are also banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Kuwait Re-Activates Ban on Bangladeshi Workers| work = Al Bawaba| accessdate = 2018-11-08| date = 2018-03-05| url = https://www.albawaba.com/news/kuwait-re-activates-ban-bangladeshi-workers-1097934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its relatively small territory, Kuwait has proven crude [[List of countries by proven oil reserves#Countries|oil reserves]] of 104 billion barrels, estimated to be 10% of the world's reserves. According to the constitution, all natural resources in the country are state property. Kuwait currently pumps 2.9 million [[Barrel per day|bpd]] and its full production capacity is a little over 3 million bpd.

===Finance===
The [[Kuwait Investment Authority]] (KIA) is Kuwait's [[sovereign wealth fund]] specializing in foreign investment. The KIA is the world's oldest sovereign wealth fund. Since 1953, the Kuwaiti government has directed investments into Europe, United States and [[Asia Pacific]]. {{As of|2015}}, the holdings were valued at $592 billion in assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swfinstitute.org/swfs/kuwait-investment-authority/ |title=Kuwait Investment Authority Profile Page |publisher=[[Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute]] |accessdate=12 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308013314/http://www.swfinstitute.org/swfs/kuwait-investment-authority/ |archivedate=8 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[Sovereign wealth fund#Largest sovereign wealth funds|5th largest]] sovereign wealth fund in the world.

Kuwait has a leading position in the financial industry in the GCC; the abyss that separates Kuwait from its Persian Gulf neighbors in terms of tourism, transport, and other measures of diversification is absent in the financial sector.&lt;ref name=wages&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Herb|title=The Wages of Oil: Parliaments and Economic Development in Kuwait and the UAE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=laODBQAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-5468-4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519044149/https://books.google.com/books?id=laODBQAAQBAJ|archivedate=19 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emir has promoted the idea that Kuwait should focus its energies, in terms of economic development, on the financial industry.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt;

The historical preeminence of Kuwait (among the Persian Gulf monarchies) in finance dates back to the founding of the [[National Bank of Kuwait]] in 1952.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; The bank was the first local publicly traded corporation in the Persian Gulf region.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, an alternative stock market, trading in shares of Persian Gulf companies, emerged in Kuwait, the [[Souk Al-Manakh stock market crash|Souk Al-Manakh]].&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; At its peak, its market capitalization was the third highest in the world, behind only the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Japan]], and ahead of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[France]].&lt;ref name=wages/&gt;

Kuwait has a large wealth-management industry that stands out in the region.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; Kuwaiti investment companies administer more assets than those of any other GCC country, save the much larger Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; The Kuwait Financial Centre, in a rough calculation, estimated that Kuwaiti firms accounted for over one-third of the total assets under management in the GCC.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; The relative strength of Kuwait in the financial industry extends to its stock market.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; For many years, the total valuation of [[List of companies of Kuwait|all companies]] listed on the [[Kuwait Stock Exchange]] far exceeded the value of those on any other GCC bourse, except Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; In 2011, financial and banking companies made up more than half of the market capitalization of the Kuwaiti bourse; among all the Persian Gulf states, the market capitalization of Kuwaiti financial-sector firms was, in total, behind only that of Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt;

In recent years, Kuwaiti investment companies have invested large percentages of their assets abroad, and their foreign assets have become substantially larger than their domestic assets.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt;

===Transport===
{{Main article|Transport in Kuwait}}
Kuwait has an extensive and modern network of highways. [[Roads in Kuwait|Roadways]] extended {{convert|5749|km|0|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|4887|km|0|abbr=on}} is paved. There are more than two million passenger cars, and 500,000 commercial taxis, buses, and trucks in use. On major highways the maximum speed is {{convert|120|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Since there is no railway system in the country, most people travel by automobiles.

[[File:Kuwait highway.jpg|thumb|A highway in Kuwait City]]
The country's public transportation network consists almost entirely of bus routes. The state owned Kuwait Public Transportation Company was established in 1962. It runs local bus routes across Kuwait as well as longer distance services to other [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]]. The main private bus company is CityBus, which operates about 20 routes across the country. Another private bus company, Kuwait Gulf Link Public Transport Services, was started in 2006. It runs local bus routes across Kuwait and longer distance services to neighbouring Arab countries.

There are two airports in Kuwait. [[Kuwait International Airport]] serves as the principal hub for international air travel. State-owned [[Kuwait Airways]] is the largest airline in the country. A portion of the airport complex is designated as Al Mubarak Air Base, which contains the headquarters of the [[Kuwait Air Force]], as well as the Kuwait Air Force Museum. In 2004, the first private airline of Kuwait, [[Jazeera Airways]], was launched. In 2005, the second private airline, [[Wataniya Airways]] was founded.

Kuwait has one of the largest shipping industries in the region. The Kuwait Ports Public Authority manages and operates ports across Kuwait.

Kuwait's official language is [[Modern Standard Arabic]], but its everyday usage is limited to journalism and education. [[Kuwaiti Arabic]] is the variant of Arabic used in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orca.cf.ac.uk/55661/1/U584180.pdf page 19] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713142832/http://orca.cf.ac.uk/55661/1/U584180.pdf |date=13 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[English language|English]] is widely understood and often used as a business language. Beside English, [[French language|French]] is taught as a third language for the students of the humanities at schools, but for two years only. Kuwaiti Arabic is a variant of [[Gulf Arabic]], sharing similarities with the dialects of neighboring coastal areas in Eastern Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuwait.tt/articledetails.aspx?Id=161203|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120084008/http://kuwait.tt/articledetails.aspx?Id=161203|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 January 2015|title=خالد الرشيد: "اللهجة الكويتية" "مظلومة" في مدارسنا.. لأن أغلب معلمينا وافدون|date=20 January 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to immigration during its early history as well as trade, Kuwaiti Arabic borrowed a lot of words from [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.p2bk.com/mag/mag_jan2011.pdf|title=page 28|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713142830/http://www.p2bk.com/mag/mag_jan2011.pdf|archivedate=13 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6750">The '''Ladies' Land League''' (founded 31 January 1881; dissolved 10 August 1882) was an auxiliary of the [[Irish National Land League]] and took over the functions of that organization when its leadership was imprisoned.

==Background==
The Irish National Land League was founded by [[ Michael Davitt]] in 1879. Its aims were a) "to bring about a reduction of rack rents" and b) "to facilitate the obtaining of the ownership of the soil by the occupiers". &lt;ref name="Moody"&gt;Moody, T. W., ''Davitt and Irish Revolution 1846-1882'', Clarendon Press Oxford, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], the dominant political figure of the day, was chosen as President. By late 1880 Davitt felt sure that the leadership of the League would soon be imprisoned. He suggested that a Ladies' Land League be set up to carry on the work after their imprisonment. A few months previously a Ladies' Land League Committee had been set up in New York by [[Fanny Parnell]], Charles' sister, to raise funds for the Irish National Land League. Parnell was strongly opposed but Davitt and the Treasurer, Patrick Egan, persuaded the Central Committee.&lt;ref name ="Moody"/&gt; Davitt suggested [[Anna Parnell]], another sister, to head it and on 31 January 1881 at 39, Sackville Street, the Ladies' Land League was formally established.

==Work of the Ladies' Land League== 
The organisation grew rapidly. By May 1881 there were 321 branches in Ireland, with branches also in Britain, the U.S.A., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="O'Neill"/&gt;

At Central Office a detailed register, referred to by the women as the "Book of Kells" was kept of information sent in weekly  by the local branches. This detailed every estate, the name of the landlord or agent, number of tenants, rent paid, valuation, number of evictions that had taken place and the number  pending .&lt;ref name="O'Neill"&gt;O'Neill, Marie, ''From Parnell to De Valera ; a biography of Jennie Wyse Power, 1858-1941, Blackwater Press 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
When notice of a pending eviction was received, members travelled to the area bringing money for assistance. If the tenants wanted to bring a law case, the league instructed a solicitor and paid his costs. They also erected wooden huts, if they could, for the evicted tenants, though the police often stopped this.
In October the Land League leaders were jailed and the League banned. From jail they issued a "No Rent " manifesto. From this point on the women were responsible for continuing the work.

==Catholic church response==
On Sunday 12 March 1881, just more than a month after the formation of the league, a pastoral letter of Archbishop [[ Edward MacCabe|Edward McCabe]] of Dublin was read out in all the churches of the diocese. It condemned the league in the strongest terms, deploring that "our Catholic daughters, be they matrons or virgins, are called forth, under the flimsy pretext of charity, to take their stand in the noisy street of life."
McCabe was not representative of all bishops, particularly [[Archbishop Thomas Croke]] of Cashel, a strong supporter of the original league. Croke published a letter in the [[Freeman's Journal]] challenging the "monstrous imputations" in McCabe's pastoral. It was quite a church scandal for one bishop to attack the pastoral of another. McCabe complained to the Vatican, backing his complaints with a thick file of Irish newspaper clippings about events around the country. Bishop Moran was charged with sorting out the quarrel and managed to elicit a grudging apology to McCabe from Croke for being "technically" wrong in his actions.

The dissension was revived somewhat in the summer of 1882. An "Address by the Catholic Bishops of Ireland to their Flocks on the State of the Country" was to be issued on 10 June. McCabe (now Cardinal) and another bishop tried to have a public condemnation of the Ladies' Land League inserted into the Address. The other bishops resisted on the basis that it would probably do more harm than good. They contented themselves with expressing their hope that "the women of Ireland will continue to be the glory of their sex and the noble angels of stainless modesty". When newspapers interpreted this as a condemnation of the league, Croke wrote again to the Freeman's Journal to deny that this had been the intention of the bishops. Again complaints about him were made to the Vatican and again he had to account for himself to church authorities.&lt;ref name ="Coté"/&gt;

==Government response== 
The order banning the League made no direct reference to the Ladies' Land League but many police officers tried to insist that the ban included the women's group. Eventually, on 16 December, Inspector General Hillier of the R.I.C. ordered the police to stop the women's meetings.&lt;ref name="O'Neill"/&gt;. Anna Parnell defiantly issued a notice to all Ladies' Land League branches in the country, widely publicised in the press, calling on them all to hold a meeting at 1.30 p.m. on 1 January 1882.&lt;ref name ="Coté"&gt; Coté, Jane McL., ''Fanny and Anna Parnell'', Gill and Macmillan, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution==
On 3 May 1882 Parnell and other leaders were released from jail after agreeing the [[ Kilmainham Treaty]].This included some improvement in the 1881 Land Act. He now wished to turn his attention more to the Home Rule question. The Irish National Land League was replaced by the Irish National League. Parnell also wanted to see an end to the Ladies' Land League. There had been increased violence when he was in jail and he saw Anna as too radical. The organization had an overdraft of £5,000 which Parnell agreed to clear from central funds only if the organization was dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Travers, Pauric, ''"No Turning Back": Anna Parnell, Identity, Memory and Gender'', in The Ivy Leaf: The Parnells Remembered, Pauric Travers and Donal McCartney, eds, University College Dublin Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 
At a meeting of the Central Committee on 10 August 1882 The Ladies' Land League voted to dissolve itself. Anna herself was not in attendance at that meeting having suffered a physical and mental collapse after the sudden death of Fanny the previous month at the age of 33.

The records of the Ladies' Land League were lost to history in 1916.
[[Jennie Wyse Power]] who had served on the Central Committte had kept them in her house in Henry Street. When fire spread from Sackville Street during the 1916 Rising, her house was destroyed and the records perished in the blaze.&lt;ref&gt; O'Neill, p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4014">'''Leonard Montefiore''' (1853, [[Kensington]], [[London]] – 1879) was an author and philanthropist. He was a grandnephew of [[Moses Montefiore]] and a nephew of [[Francis Goldsmid]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simonbeattie.co.uk/catalogues/january_2016.pdf Retrieved 2017-10-08 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

In October 1870 Montefiore entered [[University College London]] where  he attended lectures for the next two years. It was at this time that he formed a friendship with [[Henry Birchenough]] that was described in his "Essays and Letters" as "the greatest friendship of his life"&lt;ref&gt;Essays and Letters by Leonard A. Montefiore, in Memoriam, Page 10, Privately Printed, Chiswick Press; C Whittingham and Co.  London 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; Montefiore attended [[Balliol College]], Oxford  where his posthumous memoire reports that he was a devotee of [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]. Whilst at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] he became a friend of [[Oscar Wilde]] who, after Montefiore's death allegedly proposed to his sister Charlotte. &lt;ref&gt;The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde, Neil Mckenna, Randon House, 2011-02-28&lt;/ref&gt;. He was also influenced by [[Arnold Toynbee]] and [[Benjamin Jowett]]. 

==Philanthropic Work==
Montefiore was Chief assistant to reformer [[Samuel Barnett (reformer)|Samuel Barnett]] in his work regarding the extension of Oxford University to London and was secretary of the [[Tower Hamlets]] branch of the Society for the extension of University Teaching. Montefiore was the Secretary of the Jewish Schools in [[Red Lion Square]] from April 1877 until his departure for America and became a member of the [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]] in 1878.

The Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10960-montefiore|title=MONTEFIORE|website=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; says "Montefiore was associated with many philanthropic movements, especially with the movement for women's emancipation."

Montefiore died  at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], aged 27. According to the Women's rights activist [[Emily Faithfull]] in her book "Three Visits to America" published in 1884 Montefiore died "''While he was visiting the United States, in order to see for himself what could be learned from the political and social condition of the people, must ever be deplored. The world can ill afford to lose men of such deep thought and energetic action.''"&lt;ref&gt;Three Visits to America, Chapter 19, Emily Faithful, Publisher Fowler and Wells, 753 Broadway 1884&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essays and Letters==
Montefiore's posthumously published "Essays and Letters" are divided into three sections with a foreword by [[Lord Milner]] who was a mutual friend of Henry Birchenough and Montefiore and had learnt to know the latter at [[Balliol College]] where both were influenced by [[Toynbee]].

The first section of "Essays and Letters" deals with primarily German politics including Alsace Lorraine since 1871, the second section covers German literature, including [[Heine]], [[Goethe]], [[Heinrich von Treitschke]], [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein]] and [[Joseph Görres]]. The third section is on social and miscellaneous issues, and includes articles on the [[Oneida community]], working women, the position of women in the labour market and the Art Museum in Berlin. 


==Memorial==
A memorial fountain in memory of Montefiore exists in Stepney Green, East London.&lt;ref name="londonremembers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/leonard-montefiore-|website=londonremembers.com|title=www.londonremembers.com/memorials/leonard-montefiore-|accessdate=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lesbian Nation: The Feminist Solution''''' is a 1973 book by the radical lesbian feminist author and cultural critic [[Jill Johnston]]. The book was originally published as a series of essays featured in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' from 1969 to 1972.

==Thesis==
In the book Johnston outlines her vision of [[Radical feminism|radical]] [[lesbian feminism]]. She argues in favor of [[Separatist feminism|lesbian separatism]], writing that women should make a total break from men and male-dominated capitalist institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/arts/21johnston.html |title=Jill Johnston, Critic Who Wrote ‘Lesbian Nation,’ Dies at 81 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston also wrote that female [[heterosexuality]] was a form of collaboration with [[patriarchy]]. Writing in the ''[[The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide|Gay &amp; Lesbian Review]]'' in 2007, Johnston summarized her views:

::Once I understood the feminist doctrines, a lesbian separatist position seemed the commonsensical position, especially since, conveniently, I was an L-person. Women wanted to remove their support from men, the ‘enemy’ in a movement for reform, power and self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glreview.com/issues/13.2/13.2-johnston.php |title=Was Lesbian Separatism Inevitable? |publisher=''[[The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813001841/http://glreview.com/issues/13.2/13.2-johnston.php |archivedate=2007-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Becki L. Ross wrote the book ''The House That Jill Built: A Lesbian Nation in Formation'', which analyzes the history of the lesbian feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The House That Jill Built: A Lesbian Nation in Formation|last= Ross|first= Beck L.|authorlink= |year= 1995|publisher= [[University of Toronto Press]]|location= Toronto, Ontario|isbn= 0-671-21433-0|page= |pages= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Middle Ages}}
{{further information|List of ancient great powers}}
{{distinguish|Empires of the Middle Ages}}

This is a list of [[great powers]] during the [[medieval period]]. The term "great power" has only been used in historiography and political science since the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fueter|first=Eduard|title=World history, 1815–1930|publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Company|year=1922|location=United States of America|pages=25–28, 36–44|isbn=1-58477-077-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XeKyv9l-3QEC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22Great+Powers%22+%22Congress+of+Vienna%22&amp;q=%22Great%20Powers%22%20%22Congress%20of%20Vienna%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Lord Castlereagh]], the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]], first used the term in its diplomatic context in 1814. Use of the term in medieval historiography is therefore idiosyncratic to each author. In historiography of the pre-modern period, it is more typical to talk of [[empire]]s (itself a poorly-defined term, see [[list of empires]]).

==Muslim states==
{{further information|Islamic conquests|Golden Age of Islam|Turkic expansion|Greater Persia}}
{{further information|List of Muslim empires and dynasties}}

The [[Middle Ages]] proper begin with the collapse of the remnants of [[Late Antiquity]] in the 7th century due to the [[Islamic conquests]].
The [[Old World]] is largely dominated by Muslim [[caliphate]]s during the mid-7th to 10th centuries.

'''Loubna Mrie''' (born 1991) is a [[Syria]]n civil rights activist.

Mrie comes from an [[Alawites|Alawite]] family from a village near [[Latakia]]. Her father is a high official in the [[Syrian Arab Air Force|Syrian Air Force]] Intelligence. Despite her family ties, she is one of a few Alawites to join the fight against the [[Assad regime]] and has been branded a traitor by her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Syria conflict: 'My father wants me dead'|date=2013-05-02|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22389484|language=en-GB|accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As rioting broke out in the initial stages of the Syrian Civil War, Loubna attended [[Latakia University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/alawite-fsa-supporter-whose-father-backs-assad-tells-of-a-syrian-family-ripped-apart|title=Alawite FSA supporter whose father backs Assad tells of a Syrian family ripped apart {{!}} The National|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but moved to [[Damascus]] in 2012 as Latakia was deemed to be unsafe for activists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/read/i-left-my-family-for-the-free-syrian-army-000205-v19n11|title=I Left My Family for the Free Syrian Army {{!}} VICE {{!}} United States|date=2012-11-27|newspaper=VICE|language=en-us|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to Assad troops opening fire on civilian protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/world/middleeast/26syria.html|title=Syrian Troops Open Fire on Protesters in Several Cities|last=Slackman|first=Michael|date=2011-03-25|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later joined the [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA) where she helped with the transport of food and medical aid, then with the smuggling of ammunition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She promoted the aims of the revolution in the Alawitian community and spoke with the victims of government-run troops.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/11/syria-shabiha-alawite-peace|title=Syrian exile: 'My mother is dead.

On August 11, 2012, her mother was abducted, according to her father, who subsequently broke off all contact with her.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Loubna then received information from a friend with details about the death of her mother. It is said that her father killed her mother. In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]],'' she talked about her father stating that "he wished he could do the same to me."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She later became a photojournalist with [[Reuters]] based in [[Aleppo]] where she covered the conflict then moved to New York where she is a researcher and commentator on Syrian and Middle Eastern affairs. She has been published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]'', among other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neareaststudies.as.nyu.edu/object/Loubna_Mrie.html|title=Loubna Mrie, Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, New York University|website=neareaststudies.as.nyu.edu|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure of [[Moldova]]''' ({{lang|ro|Ministerul Economiei şi Infrastructurii}}) is one of the nine ministries of the [[Cabinet of Moldova|Government of Moldova]].

The current minister is [[Octavian Calmîc]].

==History==
Ministry of Economy of Moldova was founded on 1 June 1990, as Ministry of National Economy of SSR Moldova, while Moldova was part of [[Soviet Union]]. Over years, it was a few times restructured and renamed, as follows:
*Ministry of Economy and Finances (1991-1992)
*Ministry of Economy (1992-1997)
*Ministry of Economy and Reforms (1997-2001)
*Ministry of Economy (2009-2017)
*Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure (2017-present)

In 2017 as part of the government refom in Moldova, the '''Ministry of Economy''' was renamed to Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure, absorbing the '''Ministry of Transport and Roads Infrastructure''', and the '''Ministry of Informational Technologies and Communications''', becoming their legal successor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&amp;view=doc&amp;lang=1&amp;id=370968 HOTĂRÎRE Nr. 594 din 26.07.2017 cu privire la restructurarea administrației publice centrale de specialitate]&lt;/ref&gt; Also this ministry took the domain of constructions from the former Minister of Construction and Regional Development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&amp;view=doc&amp;lang=1&amp;id=371706 HOTĂRÎRE Nr. 189 din 21.07.2017 pentru aprobarea listei ministerelor]&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Nihongo|'''Mountain Village Operation Unit'''|山村工作隊|Sanson Kōsakutai}} was an underground organization of the early 1950s under the direction of the Interim Central Directorate of the [[Japanese Communist Party]], an informal group created by the party’s majority Shokanha faction, which sought to foment an armed uprising against the Japanese government and US occupational authorities. The Mountain Village Operation Unit emulated [[Mao Zedong]]’s strategy of forming a base of operations in rural villages, but it achieved no successes.
== Background and history ==
In November 1949 China’s [[Liu Shaoqi]] urged spreading China’s methods of armed struggle across Asia including in Japan. He proposed this on the basis of his talks with [[Joseph Stalin]].

On 6 June 1950 [[Douglas MacArthur]], the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, ordered a purge of 24 members of JCP’s Central Committee and forbade them from engaging in any political activities. General Secretary [[Kyuichi Tokuda]] and his allies saw this repression as a perfect opportunity to take personal control of the party and, through an informal process that did not involve convening the Central Committee or the Politburo, he named the Interim Central Directorate. Tokuda excluded seven Central Committee members, including [[Kenji Miyamoto (politician)|Kenji Miyamoto]], who held dissenting points of view, and went underground.

Following the [[reverse course|red purge]], Tokuda and his group went into exile in China and on 23 February 1951, at the JCP’s 4th National Conference, they decided on a policy of armed resistance against the American occupation of Japan, issuing orders to form a “liberated zone” in the rural villages across the country, particularly among peasants in mountain villages, just like the tactics employed by the Chinese Communist Party in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. At the 5th National Conference of October 16 a new manifesto-like document was adopted called “Present Demands of the Japanese Communist Party” which included clauses on waging guerrilla war in the villages. Then clandestine organizations were created including the Chukaku Jieitai, for weapons' procurement and training, the Dokuritsu Yugekitai, for offensive guerrilla operations, and the Mountain Village Operation Unit.

The armed struggle was activated throughout the country, including terrorist attacks on police officers, arson against [[Kōban|police boxes]] and bombing trains. Then in July 1952 the Subversive Activities Prevention Law was enacted and enforced to clamp down on the JCP’s attacks. Direct attacks with [[Molotov cocktail]]s, the preferred weapon of the insurgents, abated from about the summer of 1952 but the JCP’s militant policy did not change and operations in the countryside were continued.

These campaign tactics also drew the ire of popular opinion and they suffered a setback in the [[Japanese general election, 1952|elections of October 1952]] in which all their candidates were defeated.  On 1 January 1955 the Japanese Communist Party engaged in self-criticism, labeling the insurgency “adventurism of the extreme left”, and at the 6th National Conference of 29 July 1955 the policy of armed struggle was renounced.  After the 6th National Conference the JCP adopted a policy of not excluding any party members who, though they had made mistakes, recognized the errors of the armed struggle and party split and intended sincerely to make effort in supporting the new party line.&lt;ref&gt;『日本共産党の八十年　1922～2002』　Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Publishing Bureau, 2003, page 126&lt;/ref&gt; People who didn’t accept this shift by the party to peaceful accommodation formed the nucleus of a variety of Japanese [[new left]] movements.

Currently, the Japanese Communist Party’s official evaluation is that “The policy of the 5th National Conference was not officially adopted by the party but rather was born from the breakup and subsequent takeover of the party apparatus by Tokuda’s Shokanha faction and the imposition of armed struggle on us by the Soviet Union and China. The division of the party and the extreme-left adventurism orchestrated by the Shokanha were a serious mistake.”

== How to Raise Flower Bulbs ==
“How to Raise Flower Bulbs” was the secret publication setting out concepts relating to the party’s military policy such as construction and use of Molotov cocktails. It was actually an official bulletin called “Internal and External Critiques”, but took the title of “How to Raise Flower Bulbs” in order to disguise that. It was published several times through mimeograph.&lt;ref&gt;The publication is reprinted in the following two books. Yutaka Haniya Ed,　『戦後日本思想大系-6-革命の思想』 Chikuma Shobo、1969. Kenichi Wakita　『朝鮮戦争と吹田・枚方事件』　Akashi Shoten、2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Participation in the Mountain Village Operation Unit ==
The policies of the Mountain Village Operation Unit were out of touch with the real situation in the countryside and they were not supported at all by the locals. The exception was the travelling clinics operated by deployed medical teams who were greeted warmly in many of the villages they visited without local doctors. However, their arts and culture-based campaign, including such thing as [[kamishibai]] attacking “feudalistic” landlords, was not accepted by locals and their newspapers and propaganda leaflets were quickly handed over to the police. Without achieving any of its aims, the operations of the Mountain Village Operation Unit were extinguished by a police crackdown.

In deference to the policy of the JCP, there were also students who had quit their studies and joined the Mountain Village Operation Unit. It is said that these participants were in deep despair at the change in policy of the 6th National Conference. Some of the members who escaped exposure in the police crackdown holed up in the mountains and aimed to support themselves but, being neglected and unsupplied by the JCP, they naturally dissolved. The recollections of participants are published in certain new left bulletins, and the Mountain Village Operation Unit at the time of the 6th National Conference is the backdrop for Sho Shibata’s [[Akutagawa Award]]-winning 1964 novel ''Saredo Warera ga Hibi'' ("Those Were the Days, However...").

On the other hand, it is thought that there were differences in the directive and goals of “Y Organization” on the one hand, the JCP’s Military Affairs Committee including the Chukaku Jieitai and Dokuritsu Yugekitai which were purely in the armed struggle, and the Mountain Village Operation Unit on the other hand where armed struggle coexisted with appeals to the masses. There were also people among the members of Mountain Village Operation Unit who thought that the policy of armed struggle was an absurd idea and remained active in the Unit without supporting the policy. Participation in the Unit was by the appointment of the JCP Directorate which supported Kyuichi Tokuda’s Shokanha faction, and there are some who testified that service was assigned as a punishment to students who had belonged to the former faction of Kenji Miyamoto.&lt;ref&gt;Chikai Yui　『由井誓遺稿・回想』　新制作社、1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noriaki Tsuchimoto　「「小河内山村工作隊」の記」『映画は生きものの仕事である』、Miraisha、1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nagode Trial''' ({{lang-sl|Nagodetov proces}}) was a political [[show trial]] in Slovenia in 1947.&lt;ref name="Vodušek"&gt;Vodušek Starič, Jerca. 1993. Nagodetov proces. ''Enciklopedija Slovenije'', vol. 7, p. 270. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial was carried out by the Slovene authorities under the leadership of the [[League of Communists of Slovenia|Communist Party of Slovenia]] against non-communist politicians that wished to participate in politics in Slovenia after 1945. In May 1947 the [[State Security Administration|Slovenian secret police]] (UDBA) arrested 32 highly educated intellectuals. These included some former members of the  Communist Party of Slovenia, but the majority were liberal democrats that were inclined toward western-style [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. Those arrested included [[Črtomir Nagode]], [[Ljubo Sirc]], [[Leon Kavčnik]], [[Boris Furlan]], [[Zoran Hribar]], [[Angela Vode]], [[Metod Kumelj]], [[Pavla Hočevar]], [[Svatopluk Zupan]], [[Bogdan Stare]], [[Metod Pirc]], [[Vid Lajovic]], [[Franjo Sirc]], and [[Elizabeta Hribar]], and during the trial [[Franc Snoj]] was added to the group.&lt;ref name="Vodušek"/&gt; They were interrogated and tortured for two months in Ljubljana's prisons. The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Slovenia used the Slovene media to characterize those arrested as "a handful of spies, class enemies, foreign paid agents, who have no political program and whose work, with no political value at all, is to damage the people's authority." The trial against the accused began on July 29, and the proceedings were broadcast to the public via special loudspeakers on the streets. The public prosecutor in the trial was [[Viktor Avbelj]],&lt;ref name="Vodušek"/&gt; later a [[President of Slovenia|president of the presidency of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia]],&lt;ref&gt;Sirc, Ljubo Sirc. 2010. ''Dolgo življenje po smrtni obsodbi.''Ljubljana: Nova obzorja.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Drago Supančič]] was used as an incriminating witness.&lt;ref&gt;Vode, Angela, &amp; Alenka Puhar. 2004. ''Skriti spomin''. Ljubljana: Nova revija, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial became known as the "Nagode trial" after the principal defendant. After 13 days of hearings, on August 12 three of the defendants (Nagode, Boris Furlan, and Ljubo Sirc) were sentenced to be shot,&lt;ref name="Vodušek"/&gt; and the remainder were sentenced to lengthy prison sentences with forced labor, deprivation of all civil rights, and confiscation of their property.&lt;ref name="Vodušek"/&gt; Nagode was shot on September 12, 1947&lt;ref&gt;Mlakar, Boris. 1993. Črtomir Nagode. ''Enciklopedija Slovenije'', vol. 7, p. 270. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga.&lt;/ref&gt; and the death sentences against Furlan and Sirc were commuted to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref name="Vodušek"/&gt; Two of those sentenced committed suicide.

In 1991 the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia]] overturned the conviction against Nagode and his fourteen co-defendants&lt;ref name="Vodušek"/&gt; on the grounds that it was based on false testimony and that it had been a corrupt trial against imaginary Western spies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33479">'''National delimitation in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics''' was the process of [[boundary delimitation|creating well-defined national territorial units]] (Soviet socialist republics – SSR, autonomous Soviet socialist republics – ASSR, autonomous [[oblast]]s (provinces), [[raion]]s (districts) and ''[[okrug]]s'') from the ethnic diversity of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) and its subregions. The Russian term for this Soviet state policy is ''razmezhevanie'' ({{lang-ru|национально-территориальное размежевание}}, ''natsionalno-territorialnoye razmezhevaniye''), which is variously translated in English-language literature as national-territorial delimitation, demarcation, or partition.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan Ali Karasar, "The Partition of Khorezm and the Positions of Turkestanis on ''Razmezhevanie''", ''Europe-Asia Studies'', 60(7):1247-1260 (September 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; National delimitation is part of a broader process of changes in administrative-territorial division, which also changes the boundaries of territorial units, but is not necessarily linked to national or ethnic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Тархов, Сергей. [http://www.ruthenia.ru/logos/number/46/03.pdf Изменение административно-территориального деления России в XII-XX в.]&lt;/ref&gt; National delimitation in the USSR is distinct from [[nation-building]] ({{lang-ru|национальное строительство}}), which typically refers to the policies and actions implemented by the government of a national territorial unit (a [[nation state]]) after delimitation. In most cases national delimitation in the USSR was followed by ''[[korenizatsiya]]''.

==Policies of national delimitation in the Soviet Union==
[[File:Liquidated national territorial administrative units of the Russia.jpg|thumb|300px]]
Pre-1917 Russia was an imperial state, not a nation. In the 1905 Duma elections the nationalist parties received only 9 percent of all votes.&lt;ref name="Richard Overy 2004 545"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Overy|title=The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32Vy2Fj4KFUC|year=2004|publisher=W.W Norton Company, Inc|page=545}}&lt;/ref&gt; The many non-Russian ethnic groups that inhabited the Russian Empire were classified as ''inorodtsy'', or aliens.{{Citation Needed|date=November 2014}} After the [[February Revolution]], attitudes in regards to this topic began to change.&lt;ref name="marxists1917"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stalin |url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1917/03/28.htm |title=Against Federalism |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in early 1917, a [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionary]] publication called Delo Naroda, No. 5 called for Russia to be transformed into a federal state along the lines of the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref name="marxists1917"/&gt; Specifically, separate constituent units inside of this federal state would be created for the various regions and ethnic groups of Russia (such as [[Little Russia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Siberia]], and [[Central Asia|Turkestan]]).&lt;ref name="marxists1917"/&gt;

The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] that took over from the Russian Empire in 1917 was not a nation-state, nor was the Soviet leadership committed to turning their country into such a state. In the early Soviet period, even voluntary assimilation was actively discouraged, and the promotion of the national self-consciousness of the non-Russian populations was attempted. Each officially recognized ethnic minority, however small, was granted its own national territory where it enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy, national schools, and national elites.&lt;ref name="martin1998" /&gt; A written national language (if it had been lacking), national [[language planning]], native-language press, and books written in the native language came with the national territory.&lt;ref name=slezkine&gt;
Slezkine, Yuri (1994). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2501300 "The USSR as a Communal Apartment, or How a Socialist State Promoted Ethnic Particularism"]. ''[[Slavic Review]]'' 53 (2), 414–52.&lt;/ref&gt;
The attitudes towards many ethnic minorities changed dramatically in the 1930s–1940s under the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]] (despite his own [[Georgians|Georgian]] ethnic roots) with the advent of a repressive policy featuring abolition of the national institutions, [[population transfer in the Soviet Union|ethnic deportations]], [[Mass operations of the NKVD|national terror]], and [[Russification]] (mostly towards those with cross-border ethnic ties to foreign nation-states in the 1930s or compromised in the view of Stalin during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]] in the 1940s), although nation-building often continued simultaneously for others.&lt;ref name="martin1998"&gt;Martin, Terry (1998). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/235168 "The Origins of Soviet Ethnic Cleansing"]. ''[[The Journal of Modern History]]'' 70 (4), 813-861.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the establishment of the [[Soviet Union]] within the boundaries of the former [[Russian Empire]], the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik government]] began the process of national delimitation and nation building, which lasted through the 1920s and most of the 1930s. The project attempted to build nations out of the numerous ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. Defining a nation or politically conscious [[ethnic group]] was in itself a politically charged issue in the Soviet Union. In 1913, Stalin, in his work ''[[Marxism and the National Question]]'', which subsequently became the cornerstone of the Soviet policy towards nationalities, defined a nation as "a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological makeup manifested in a common culture".&lt;ref&gt;Definition of a nation in J. Stalin, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03.htm ''Marxism and the National Question''], March–May 1913; Russian original: J. Stalin, ''Collected Works in 16 Volumes'', [http://www.hrono.info/libris/stalin/2-19.html volume 2].&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the subject nationalities or communities in the Russian Empire did not fully meet these criteria. Not only cultural, linguistic, religious and tribal diversities made the process difficult but also the lack of a political consciousness of ethnicity among the people was a major obstacle to this process. Still, the process relied on the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia]]'', adopted by the [[Council of People's Commissars|Bolshevik government]] on 15 November 1917, immediately after the [[October Revolution]], which recognized equality and sovereignty of all the peoples of Russia; their right for free self-determination, up to and including secession and creation of an independent state; freedom of religion; and free development of national minorities and ethnic groups on the territory of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;

The Soviet Union (or more formally USSR – the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) was established in 1922 as a [[federation]] of nationalities, which eventually came to encompass 15 major national territories, each organized as a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Union-level republic]] (Soviet Socialist Republic or SSR). All 15 national republics, created between 1917 and 1940, had constitutionally equal rights and equal standing in the formal structure of state power. The largest of the 15 republics – Russia – was ethnically the most diverse and from the very beginning it was constituted as the RSFSR – the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], a federation within a federation. The Russian SFSR was divided in the early 1920s into some 30 autonomous ethnic territories ([[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic#Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics (ASSRs) within the Russian SFSR|Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics]] – ASSR and [[Autonomous oblasts of the Soviet Union|autonomous oblasts]] – AO), many of which exist to this day as [[Republics of Russia|ethnic republics within the Russian Federation]]. There was also a very large number of lower-level ethnic territories, such as national districts and national village [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]. The exact number of ASSR and AO varied over the years as new entities were created while old entities switched from one form to another, transformed into Union-level republics (e.g., [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh]] and [[Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kyrgyz SSR]] created in 1936, [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldovan SSR]] created in 1940), or were absorbed into larger territories (e.g., [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Crimean ASSR]] absorbed into the RSFSR in 1945 and [[Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Volga German ASSR]] absorbed into RSFSR in 1941).

The first population census of the USSR in 1926 listed 176 distinct nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/ussr_nac_26.php List of nationalities in the 1926 USSR census] on demoscrope.ru&lt;/ref&gt; Eliminating excessive detail (e.g., four ethnic groups for Jews and five ethnic groups for Georgians) and omitting very small ethnic groups, the list was condensed{{when?|date=September 2012}} into 69 nationalities.&lt;ref name=simon&gt;Gerhard Simon, ''Nationalism and Policy Toward the Nationalities in the Soviet Union: From Totalitarian Dictatorship to Post-Stalinist Society'', Westview Press, Boulder, CO, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; These 69 nationalities lived in 45 nationally delimited territories, including 16 Union-level republics (SSR) for the major nationalities, 23 autonomous regions (18 ASSR and 5 autonomous oblasts) for other nationalities within the Russian SFSR, and 6 autonomous regions within other Union-level republics (one in Uzbek SSR, one in Azerbaijan SSR, one in Tajik SSR, and three in Georgian SSR).

Despite the general policy of granting national territories to all ethnic groups, several nationalities remained without their own territories in the 1920s and the 1930s. These included Poles, Bulgarians, Greeks, Hungarians, Gypsies, Uigurs, Koreans, and Gagauz (today the Gagauz live in a compact area in the south of Moldova, where they enjoy a measure of autonomy). The Volga Germans lost their national territory with the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1941. The peoples of the North had neither autonomous republics nor autonomous oblasts, but since the 1930s they have been organized in 10 [[Autonomous okrugs of Russia|national ''okrugs'']], such as the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, the Koryak Autonomous Okrug, the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, and others.&lt;ref name=simon /&gt;

Besides national republics, oblasts, and okrugs, several hundred national districts (with populations between 10,000 and 50,000) and several thousand national townships (population 500 to 5,000) were established. In some cases this policy required voluntary or forced resettlement in both directions to create a compact population. Ethnic left immigration{{clarify|date=February 2009}} and the return of non-Russian émigrés to the Soviet Union during the [[New Economic Policy]], albeit perceived as an easy cover for espionage, were not discouraged and proceeded quite actively, contributing to nation-building.&lt;ref name="martin1998" /&gt;

Soviet fear of foreign influence gained momentum from sporadic ethnic guerilla uprisings along the entire Soviet frontier throughout the 1920s. The Soviet government was particularly concerned about the loyalty of the Finnish, Polish, and German populations. However, in July 1925 the Soviet authorities felt secure enough and in order to project Soviet influence outwards, exploiting cross-border ethnic ties, granted national minorities in the border regions more privileges and national rights than those in the central regions.&lt;ref name="martin1998" /&gt; This policy was implemented especially successfully in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], which at first indeed succeeded in attracting the population of Polish [[Kresy]]. However, some Ukrainian communists claimed neighboring regions even from the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]].&lt;ref name="martin1998" /&gt;

==National delimitation in Central Asia==

Russia had conquered Central Asia in the 19th century by annexing the formerly independent Khanates of [[Khanate of Kokand|Kokand]] and [[Khanate of Khiva|Khiva]] and the [[Emirate of Bukhara]]. After the Communists took power in 1917 and created the [[Soviet Union]] it was decided to divide Central Asia into ethnically-based republics in a process known as National Territorial Delimitation (or NTD). This was in line with Communist theory that nationalism was a necessary step on the path towards an eventually communist society, and Joseph Stalin’s definition of a nation as being ''“a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture”''.

The NTD is commonly portrayed as being nothing more than a cynical exercise in [[divide and rule]], a deliberately Machiavellian attempt by Stalin to maintain Soviet hegemony over the region by artificially dividing its inhabitants into separate nations and with borders deliberately drawn so as to leave minorities within each state.&lt;ref&gt;The charge is so common as to have become almost the conventional wisdom within mainstream journalistic coverage of Central Asia, with Stalin himself often the one drawing the borders, see for example Stourton, E. in The Guardian, 2010 ''Kyrgyzstan: Stalin's deadly legacy'' https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/kyrgyzstan-stalins-deadly-legacy; Zeihan, P. for Stratfor, 2010 ''The Kyrgyzstan Crisis and the Russian Dilemma'' https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/kyrgyzstan-crisis-and-russian-dilemma; The Economist, 2010 ''Kyrgyzstan - Stalin's Harvest'' https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/06/17/stalins-harvest?story_id=16377083; Pillalamarri, A in the Diplomat, 2016, ''The Tajik Tragedy of Uzbekistan'' https://thediplomat.com/2016/09/the-tajik-tragedy-of-uzbekistan/; Rashid, A in the New York Review of Books, 2010, ''Tajikistan - the Next Jihadi Stronghold?'' https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2010/11/29/tajikistan-next-jihadi-stronghold; Schreck, C. in The National, 2010, ''Stalin at core of Kyrgyzstan carnage'', https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/stalin-at-core-of-kyrgyzstan-carnage-1.548241&lt;/ref&gt; Though indeed Russia was concerned at the possible threat of [[Pan-Turkism|pan-Turkic nationalism]] &lt;ref&gt;Bergne, Paul (2007) ''The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic'', IB Taurus &amp; Co Ltd, pg. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;, as expressed for example with the [[Basmachi movement]] of the 1920s, closer analysis informed by the primary sources paints a much more nuanced picture than is commonly presented.&lt;ref&gt;Haugen, Arne (2003) ''The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia'', Palgrave Macmillan, pgs. 24-5, 182-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khalid, Adeeb (2015) ''Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR'', Cornell University Press, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) ''Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan'', Princeton University Press, pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets aimed to create ethnically homogenous republics, however many areas were ethnically-mixed (e.g. specially the Ferghana Valley) and often proved difficult to assign a ‘correct’ ethnic label to some peoples (e.g. the mixed Tajik-Uzbek [[Sart]], or the various Turkmen/Uzbek tribes along the Amu Darya).&lt;ref&gt;Bergne, Paul (2007) ''The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic'', IB Taurus &amp; Co Ltd, pg. 44-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) ''Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan'', Princeton University Press, pg. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Local national elites often strongly argued (and in many cases overstated) their case and the Russians were often forced to adjudicate between them, further hindered by a lack of expert knowledge and the paucity of accurate or up-to-date ethnographic data on the region.&lt;ref&gt;Bergne, Paul (2007) ''The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic'', IB Taurus &amp; Co Ltd, pg. 44-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) ''Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan'', Princeton University Press, pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore NTD also aimed to create ‘viable’ entities, with economic geographical, agricultural and infrastructural matters also to be taken into account and frequently trumping those of ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;Bergne, Paul (2007) ''The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic'', IB Taurus &amp; Co Ltd, pg. 43-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starr, S. Frederick (ed.) (2011) ''Ferghana Valley – the Heart of Central Asia'' Routledge, pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The attempt to balance these contradictory aims within an overall nationalist framework proved exceedingly difficult and often impossible, resulting in the drawing of often tortuously convoluted borders, multiple enclaves and the unavoidable creation of large minorities who ended up living in the ‘wrong’ republic. Additionally the Soviets never intended for these borders to become international frontiers.

[[File:SovietCentralAsia1922.svg|right|300px|thumb|[[Soviet Central Asia]] in 1922 before national delimitation]]

NTD of the area along ethnic lines had been proposed as early as 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Bergne, Paul (2007) ''The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic'', IB Taurus &amp; Co Ltd, pg. 40-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starr, S. Frederick (ed.) (2011) ''Ferghana Valley – the Heart of Central Asia'' Routledge, pg. 105&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Central Asia consisted of two Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics (ASSRs) within the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]]: the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan ASSR]], created in April 1918 and covering large parts of what are now southern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, as well as Turkmenistan), and the [[Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (1920–25)|Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Kirghiz ASSR, Kirgizistan ASSR on the map), which was created on 26 August 1920 in the territory roughly coinciding with the northern part of today's Kazakhstan (at this time Kazakhs were referred to as ‘Kyrgyz’ and what are now the Kyrgyz wre deemed a sub-group of the Kazakhs and referred to as ‘Kara-Kyrgyz’ i.e. ‘mountain-Kyrgyz’). There were also the two separate successor ‘republics’ of the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and the [[Khanate of Khiva]], which were transformed into the [[Bukharan People's Soviet Republic|Bukhara]] and [[Khorezm People's Soviet Republic]]s following the takeover by the [[Red Army]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Bergne, Paul (2007) ''The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic'', IB Taurus &amp; Co Ltd, pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 February 1924 the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] and [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the Soviet Union announced that it would proceed with NTD in Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) ''Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan'', Princeton University Press, pg. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergne, Paul (2007) ''The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic'', IB Taurus &amp; Co Ltd, pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The process was to be overseen by a Special Committee of the Central Asian Bureau, with three sub-committees for each of what were deemed to be the main nationalities of the region (Kazakhs, Turkmen and Uzbeks), with work then exceedingly rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) ''Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan'', Princeton University Press, pg. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) ''Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan'', Princeton University Press, pgs. 52-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergne, Paul (2007) ''The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic'', IB Taurus &amp; Co Ltd, pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starr, S. Frederick (ed.) (2011) ''Ferghana Valley – the Heart of Central Asia'' Routledge, pg. 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khalid, Adeeb (2015) ''Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR'', Cornell University Press, pg. 271-2&lt;/ref&gt; There were initial plans to possibly keep the Khorezm and Bukhara PSRs, it was eventually decided to partition them in April 1924, over the often vocal opposition of their Communist Parties (the Khorezm CP in particular were reluctant to destroy their PSR and had to be strong-armed into voting for their own dissolution in July of that year).&lt;ref&gt;Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) ''Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan'', Princeton University Press, pgs. 56-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkestan ASSR was officially partitioned into two Soviet Socialist Republics (SSR), the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmen SSR]] and the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbek SSR]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergne, Paul (2007) ''The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic'', IB Taurus &amp; Co Ltd, pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkmen SSR roughly matched the borders of today's Turkmenistan and it was created as a home for the [[Turkmens]] of Soviet Central Asia. The Bukhara and Khorezm People's Soviet Republics were largely absorbed into the Uzbek SSR, which also included other territories inhabited by [[Uzbeks]] as well as those inhabited by ethnic [[Tajiks]]. At the same time, the [[Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Tajik ASSR]] was created within the Uzbek SSR for the Tajik ethnic population&lt;ref&gt;Bergne, Paul (2007) ''The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic'', IB Taurus &amp; Co Ltd, pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt; and, in May 1929, it was separated from Uzbek SSR and upgraded to the status of a full Soviet Socialist Republic (the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|Tajik SSR]]).&lt;ref&gt;Starr, S. Frederick (ed.) (2011) ''Ferghana Valley – the Heart of Central Asia'' Routledge, pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khalid, Adeeb (2015) ''Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR'', Cornell University Press, 302-3, 307&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz SSR]] (today's Kyrgyzstan) was created only in 1936; between 1929 and 1936 it existed as the [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast]] (province) within the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]].&lt;ref&gt;William Fierman, ed., ''Soviet Central Asia: The Failed Transformation'', Westview Press, Boulder, CO, 1991, pp. 16-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergne, Paul (2007) ''The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic'', IB Taurus &amp; Co Ltd, pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]] was also created at that time (5 December 1936), thus completing the process of national delimitation of Soviet Central Asia into five Soviet Socialist Republics that in 1991 would become five independent states.

==Nation-building for ethnic minorities==
In the 1920s and the 1930s, the policy of national delimitation, which assigned national territories to ethnic groups and nationalities, was followed by nation-building, attempting to create a full range of national institutions within each national territory. Each officially recognized ethnic minority, however small, was granted its own national territory where it enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy, in addition to national elites.&lt;ref name="martin1998" /&gt; A written national language was developed (if it had been lacking), national [[language planning]] was implemented, native teachers were trained, and national schools were established. This was always accompanied by native-language press and books written in the native language. National elites were encouraged to develop and take over the leading administrative and Party positions, sometimes in proportions exceeding the proportion of the native population.&lt;ref name="slezkine" /&gt;

With the grain requisition crises, [[Droughts and famines in Russia and the Soviet Union|famines]]; troubled economic conditions; international destabilization and the reversal of the immigration flow in the early 1930s, the Soviet Union became increasingly worried about the possible disloyalty of diaspora ethnic groups with cross-border ties (especially [[Finns]], [[Germans]] and [[Poles]]), residing along its western borders.  This eventually led to the start of Stalin's repressive policy towards them.&lt;ref name="martin1998" /&gt;

Each adult citizen's ethnicity ({{lang-ru|национальность}}) was necessarily recorded in his passport after the introduction of the [[passport system in the Soviet Union]] in 1932 and was determined by his choice between his parents' ethnicities (a practice that did not exist in [[Russian Empire]] and is abolished in today's [[Russia]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The Bolsheviks’ plan was to identify the total sum of all national, cultural, linguistic, and territorial diversities under their rule and establish scientific criteria to identify which groups of people were entitled to the description of 'nation'. This task relied on the existing work of tsarist-era ethnographers and statisticians, as well as new research conducted under Soviet auspices. Because most people did not know what is meant by a nation, some of them simply gave names when asked about [[ethnic group]]. Many groups were thought to be biologically similar, but culturally distinct. In Central Asia, many identified their "nation" as "Muslim." In other cases, geography made the difference, or even whether one lived in a town versus the countryside. Principally, however, dialects or languages formed the basis for distinguishing between various nations. The results were often contradictory and confusing. More than 150 nations were counted in Central Asia alone. Some were quickly subordinated to others, with communities which had hitherto been counted as "nations" now deemed to be simply tribes. As a result, the number of nations shrunk over the decades.&lt;ref name=slezkine /&gt;

"'''Nevertheless, she persisted'''" is an expression adopted by the [[feminist movement]], especially in the United States. It became popular in 2017 after the [[United States Senate]] voted to silence Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]]'s objections to [[United States congressional hearing|confirmation]] of Senator [[Jeff Sessions]] as [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]]. Senate Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] uttered this sentence during comments following the vote in an effort to defend the Senate's actions and blame Warren.

The expression [[Viral phenomenon|went viral]] as feminists posted it with [[hashtag]] references to other women. [[Conservatism in the United States|Conservative critics]] objected that comparisons between Warren and other female political activists were inappropriate. Its meaning expanded to refer to women's persistence in breaking barriers, despite being silenced or ignored.

== Background ==

=== Senate debate on confirmation of Jeff Sessions ===

On February 7, 2017, the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] debated confirmation of Senator [[Jeff Sessions]] of [[Alabama]] to become [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] of Massachusetts spoke against confirmation, criticizing his record on [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]].&lt;ref name="S853-1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/crec/2017/02/06/CREC-2017-02-06-bk2.pdf|title=Congressional Record — Senate|date=February 7, 2017|website=Congress.gov|page=S853|access-date=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Warren quoted a statement from 1986 by former Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] regarding Senator Sessions' nomination to federal court judge, "'He is, I believe, a disgrace to the Justice Department, and he should withdraw his nomination and resign his position.'"&lt;ref name=WaPo-KaneOKeefe&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kane |first1=Paul |last2=O'Keefe |first2=Ed |date=2017-02-08 |title=Republicans vote to rebuke Elizabeth Warren, saying she impugned Sessions's character |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/07/republicans-vote-to-rebuke-elizabeth-warren-for-impugning-sessionss-character/ |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Warren said she "will stand with Senator Kennedy, and, like he did, I will cast my vote against the nomination of Senator Sessions."&lt;ref name="S853-1" /&gt;

Senator Warren continued by reading a letter that [[Coretta Scott King]] had written to the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] in 1986:

{{Quote|text=Civil rights leaders, including [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|my husband]] and [[Albert Turner (civil rights activist)|Albert Turner]], have fought long and hard to achieve free and unfettered access to the ballot box. Mr. SESSIONS has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to happen. Mr. SESSIONS' conduct as U.S. Attorney, from his politically-motivated voting fraud prosecutions to his indifference toward criminal violations of civil rights laws, indicates that he lacks the temperament, fairness and judgment to be a federal judge.&lt;ref name="S853-1"/&gt;|sign=[[Coretta Scott King]]|source=}}

=== Senate Rule XIX ===
[[File:Senator Daines Cuts Off Senator Warren's Speech on Attorney General Nominee Jeff Sessions.webm|thumb|Senator Daines Cuts Off Senator Warren's Speech on Attorney General Nominee Jeff Sessions (video)]]

While Senator Warren was reading the letter from Mrs. King, Presiding Senate Chair [[Steve Daines]] of Montana interrupted her, reminding her of Senate [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate, Rule XIX|Rule XIX,]]&lt;ref name=WaPo-170208&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/08/the-silencing-of-elizabeth-warren-and-an-old-senate-rule-prompted-by-a-fistfight/ |title=The silencing of Elizabeth Warren and an old Senate rule prompted by a fistfight |author=Hawkins, Derek |date=February 8, 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibits ascribing "to another senator or to other senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a senator."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/nevertheless-she-persisted-and-the-age-of-the-weaponized-meme/516012/|title='Nevertheless, She Persisted' and the Age of the Weaponized Meme|last=Garber|first=Megan|date=8 February 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=22 March 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-republicans-facebook-twitter.html|title=‘Nevertheless, She Persisted’: How Senate’s Silencing of Warren Became a Meme|last=Victor|first=Daniel|date=2017-02-08|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=22 March 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Warren stated that she had only said that former Senator Kennedy had called Senator Sessions a disgrace, and she asked whether reading King's letter that had been admitted into the Senate Record in 1986 was a violation of Senate Rules. Presiding Senate Chair Daines again quoted Rule XIX. Senator Warren asked to continue reading Mrs. King's letter, and Presiding Senate Chair Daines allowed her to do so.&lt;ref name= S853-2&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/crec/2017/02/06/CREC-2017-02-06-bk2.pdf|title=Congressional Record — Senate|date=February 7, 2017|website=Congress.gov|page=S853|access-date=April 10, 2017|quote=&lt;br/&gt;The PRESIDING OFFICER.

=== Sen. McConnell's objection ===
[[File:Sen. McConnell Refuses to Let Sen. Warren Speak About Attorney General Nominee Sessions.webm|thumb|left|Sen. McConnell Refuses to Let Sen. Warren Speak About Attorney General Nominee Sessions (video)]]

While Senator Warren continued reading the letter, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of [[Kentucky]] interrupted, saying, "The senator has impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama, as warned by the chair." Senator McConnell objected to a line from Ms. King's letter, "Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens",&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-merkley-reads-part-of-coretta-scott-kings-letter-on-senate-floor_us_589adbc4e4b09bd304bedc35|title=Democrat Defies GOP, Reads Part Of Coretta Scott King’s Letter On Senate Floor|last=Shapiro|first=Rebecca|date=8 February 2017|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=24 March 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Senator Warren had quoted prior to the warning.&lt;ref name="S853-2" /&gt;

Senator Warren said she was "surprised that the words of&amp;nbsp;Coretta Scott King&amp;nbsp;are not suitable for debate in the&amp;nbsp;United States Senate", and requested to continue. Senator Daines asked whether there was objection. Senator McConnell objected, and Senator Daines called for a vote saying, "The senator will take her seat", preventing Senator Warren from continuing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Senate voted to sustain McConnell's objection along party lines, 49–43, silencing Warren for the duration of the Sessions confirmation hearings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/Social-Media-She-Persisted-Senate-Warren-413153543.html|title='Nevertheless, She Persisted' Goes Viral After Warren Rebuke|date=8 February 2017|publisher=[[WRC-TV|NBC4 Washington]]|access-date=22 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty hours remained in the hearings, and Democrats objected to Senator Warren's silencing.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Senator [[Jeff Merkley]] of [[Oregon]] subsequently read the letter from Coretta Scott King without objection.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/02/jeff_merkley_reads_coretta_scott_king_letter_about_jeff_sessions.html|title=Jeff Merkley reads Coretta Scott King's letter about Jeff Sessions on Senate floor (video)|last=Campuzano|first=Eder|date=7 February 2017|work=OregonLive.com, [[The Oregonian]].|access-date=24 March 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Cory Booker]] of [[New Jersey]] pointed out that the letter was already in the 1986 ''[[Congressional Record]]''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== After the vote ===
[[File:Nevertheless, she persisted.webm|thumb|"Nevertheless, she persisted", by [[Mitch McConnell]], about [[Elizabeth Warren]] (video)]]

Following the Senate ruling to silence Senator Warren, Senator McConnell said on the Senate floor:

{{Quote|text=Senator Warren was giving a lengthy speech. She had appeared to violate the rule. She was warned. She was given an explanation.

[[File:March for Truth SF 20170603-5617.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rosie the Riveter]] and "Nevertheless She Persisted" at [[San Francisco]] [[March for Truth]]]]

Feminists and supporters of Senator Warren immediately adopted as a rallying cry the three-word sentence, "Nevertheless, she persisted."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Mary.

On June 7, 2017, Senator Warren tweeted support for Senator [[Kamala Harris]] using the "Nevertheless She Persisted" hashtag, after Harris was admonished for interrupting Deputy Attorney General [[Rod Rosenstein]] during a hearing.&lt;ref name="cnn-7jun2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herb|first1=Jeremy|title=Senators try to quiet Harris, but she doesn't back down|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/07/politics/kamala-harris-senate-intelligence-hearing/index.html|accessdate=June 7, 2017|newspaper=CNN|date=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservative responses ===
Others were less favorably inclined toward the expression and its application to Warren. Charlotte Allen of ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' suggested that #Shepersisted was yet another tactic in the marketing of Warren as a possible presidential candidate, describing it as "Red meat for Warren's supporters, who promptly cried [[sexism]] and compared her to [[Rosa Parks]] in her refusal to move to the back of the bus, and also to [[Marie Curie]], who never gave up on her quest to discover radium. Within hours entrepreneurs were grinding out 'Nevertheless, she persisted' T-shirts in every size and color."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-marketing-of-elizabeth-warren/article/2006822|title=The Marketing of Elizabeth Warren|last=Allen|first=Charlotte|date=14 February 2017|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]|access-date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident was also discussed in the context of Senator Warren's possible presidential candidacy by the ''[[National Review]]'''s [[David Harsanyi]], who referred to Rule XIX as "an arbitrary, speech-inhibiting rule that should not be used".  Stating "it was unlikely any persuadable voter would have even heard about Warren’s grandstanding if it weren’t for the [[wikt:kerfuffle|kerfuffle]]",  he suggested that the "fuss" (including popularity of the hashtags "#Shepersisted" and "#LetLizspeak") was indicative of a Democratic tendency to "rely heavily on the [[identity politics]] that have failed them for six years, if not longer."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/444772/elizabeth-warren-persisted-drew-extra-attention-mcconnells-silencing|title=Elizabeth Warren for President|last=Harsanyi|first=David|date=10 February 2017|work=[[National Review]]|access-date=28 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the ''National Review'', Alexandra Desanctis wrote that McConnell's remark was "inviting endless inappropriate comparisons between Warren and female political activists from around the world."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/444764/elizabeth-warren-she-persisted-offensive-progressive-rallying-cry|title=No, Elizabeth Warren Doesn’t Belong in the Same Breath as Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks|last=Desanctis|first=Alexandra|date=9 February 2017|work=[[National Review]]|access-date=28 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desanctis continued:

{{Quote|text=Tubman and [[Sojourner Truth|Truth]] were enslaved and beaten, [[Susan B. Anthony|Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton|Stanton]] were denied the right to vote, Parks was thrown in jail, and Yousafzai was shot in the brain. Warren stood in the U.S. Senate insisting that Sessions’s "racism, sexism, and bigotry" are dangerous to American freedoms, a claim that is dubious at best. The idea that she has done anything even remotely comparable to these women is ludicrous at best. And at worst, it trivializes the courage of those in whose company it places Warren and makes a mockery of their contribution to democracy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Gretel Kaufman of ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' noted that some Democrats used the hashtag #LetLizSpeak to call Senator McConnell's remarks sexist, and that video of Senator Warren reading the full letter was widely viewed on social media. Raising concerns that the incident was "an example of partisanship getting in the way of productive debate", Kaufman quoted Republican Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] of [[Utah]], as saying that "All of us&amp;nbsp;need to take stock&amp;nbsp;and need to start thinking about the people on the other side of the aisle and need to start thinking about how we might bring each other together."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2017/0208/Why-did-Senator-Warren-get-silenced-during-the-Jeff-Sessions-hearing|title=Why did Senator Warren get silenced during the Jeff Sessions hearing?|last=Kauffman|first=Gretel|date=8 February 2017|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|access-date=28 March 2017|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers posited non-political reasons for the meme's proliferation. According to Daniel Victor of ''The New York Times'', "A broader theme—that women are too commonly shushed or ignored—emerged on social media."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Victor also noted that "a man silencing a woman struck some as all too common", and "rang familiar with many women who had their own stories of being silenced."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''The Atlantic's'' Megan Garber wrote, "American culture tells women to be quiet—many ways they are reminded that they would really be so much more pleasing if they would just smile a little more, or talk a little less, or work a little harder to be pliant and agreeable."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Further, she wrote, when Senator Warren was silenced,  "many women, regardless of their politics or place...felt that silencing, viscerally... Because, regardless of their politics or place, those women have heard the same thing, or a version of it, many times before."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Heidi Stevens of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' commented, "Three little words that women can draw on for decades to come, when something needs to be said and, darn it, we plan to say it. When we’re being talked over in meetings. When we’re fighting to be heard in male-dominated fields. When we’re standing up for our values. When we’re doing valuable work and people reduce us to our appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/stevens/ct-she-persisted-elizabeth-warren-balancing-20170208-column.html|title=In silencing Sen.

The '''No Border Network''' (In the [[United Kingdom]] also called "No Borders Network" or "Noborders Network") refers to loose associations of autonomous organisations, groups, and individuals in [[Western Europe]], [[Central Europe]], [[Eastern Europe]] and beyond. They support [[freedom of movement]] and resist [[human migration]] control by coordinating international [[border]] camps, [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], direct actions, and anti-deportation campaigns.

The Western European network opposes what it says are increasingly restrictive harmonisation of asylum and immigration policy in [[Europe]], and aims to build alliances among [[migrant labor]]ers and [[refugee]]s. Common slogans used by the Network include; "No Border, No Nation, Stop Deportations!" and "No one is illegal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Border Politics: Social Movements, Collective Identities, and Globalization|last=|first=|last2=Mendez|first2=Jennifer Bickham|date=2014-10-31|publisher=NYU Press|year=|isbn=978-1-4798-5817-0|location=|page=301|pages=|via=|last1=Naples|first1=Nancy A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No Border Network has existed since 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticatac.ro/lefteast/european-citizenship-and-the-place-of-migrants-struggles-in-a-new-radical-europe-a-talk-with-sandro-mezzadra/ |title=European Citizenship and the Place of Migrants’ Struggles in a New Radical Europe.

[[File:Demonstration No Border.jpg|thumb|No Border demonstration]]
On 18 December 2007, to coincide with the UN [[International Migrants Day]], the network carried out a co-ordinated blockade of  [[Border and Immigration Agency]] (now [[UK Border Agency]]) offices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/18/immigration.politics | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Protesters blockade immigration depots | date=18 December 2007 | accessdate=7 April 2010 | first1=Sarah | last1=Bridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Bristol, Portsmouth, Newcastle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7149560.stm | work=BBC News | title=Activists hold dawn raid protests | date=18 December 2007 | accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Glasgow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7149334.stm | work=BBC News | title=Dawn raid demonstrators arrested | date=18 December 2007 | accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to prevent [[dawn raid]]s by [[Immigration Officer|immigration officers]] from taking place. This form of action has been repeated across the UK by the network several times since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bristol/somerset/7240374.stm | work=BBC News | title=Protest at deportation dawn raids | date=12 February 2008 | accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schnews.org.uk/archive/news6301.htm |title=SchNEWS 630 - Snatch of the Day |website=Schnews.org.uk |date=2008-05-02 |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2008, [[Phil Woolas]], UK [[Minister of State for Borders and Immigration]] was [[pieing|pied]] by No Borders activists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7690324.stm | work=BBC News | title=Migrant row minister hit by pie | date=24 October 2008 | accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; following his remarks on population control.

In February 2010 No Borders groups from the UK and France opened a large centre for refugees sleeping rough in [[Calais]], France, under the name "Kronstadt Hangar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/feb/04/asylum-seekers-calais-uk-france | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Solidarity is not an offence | first=Rahila | last=Gupta | date=4 February 2010 | accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calais authorities have accused "extremist activists" within to the No Borders network of being "driven by an anarchist ideology of hatred of all laws and frontiers" and engaging in, and encouraging, violence and harassment against French police and social workers at the [[Calais Jungle]] migrant camp, as well as "manipulating" and "misleading" the migrants living there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Lichfield |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/calais-jungle-uk-activists-dangerous-and-dont-care-about-refugees-says-official-responsible-for-a6905871.html |title=Calais Jungle: 'Dangerous' UK activists don't care about refugees, says official responsible for clearing camp |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=2016-03-01 |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[2004 Lok Sabha elections]] Yadav joined the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]. His stay in the party did however become short, due to the overwhelming criticism inside the [[BJP]] for accepting him in spite of his criminal record. After being expelled from the [[BJP]], Yadav reconstituted [[RPD]].

[[Image:Realprogress.jpg|thumb|300px|The Real Progress branding 'lozenge'.]]
'''''Real Progress''''' was a strapline, brand and theme of the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] in the 2004 European Election and the 2005 General Election. It was the subject of a [[The Guardian|Guardian]] editorial simply entitled "Real progress". 

==Origins==
It was conceived by the Publications Co-ordinator on the [[Green Party of England and Wales#Executive]] 25-year-old Matt Wootton in late Summer 2003. It was first used in a leaflet at the Green Party's Autumn Conference in Lancaster in 2003. The Real Progress phrase was based on a theme initiated by External Communications Co-ordinator 2000-2004 Dr Spencer Fitz-Gibbon. By the end of the year Wootton had employed graphic designer [[Jim Killock]] to unify the words Green Party and Real Progress in a single "badge" and the "lozenge" was born, inspired as a homage to the European Green Party's "rhomb" which Wootton and Killock considered clunky (see [http://www.matthewwootton.com/Green%20Party%20rebrand%20photos.html Wootton's homepage]).

==Stylistic changes==
The Real Progress rebrand was also a house style change, using a new set of colours, according to Wootton's website, inspired by the colours used on the website of the [[Swedish Green Party]].

The rebrand utilised a designer typeface - the first time the Green Party had used one - which was chosen to be the modern-looking [http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_profile FF Profile] which was chosen for its progressive, clean and slightly quirky qualities.

==Impact and significance==
The rebrand was first launched to the media at the Spring Conference 2004 and made was covered by the BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3501428.stm] and [[The Times]]. The Times article&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1041016.ece Greens to drop sandals for suits and soundbites]&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates the importance of the rebrand to the Green Party at that time, with the party apparently eschewing "beards, sandals and nut cutlets" for "sharp suits, a new colour scheme, a corporate logo and an “upbeat” range of “commonsense” policies."

Although not an essentially research-based rebrand created using qualitative feedback, Wootton and Killock (Killock joined the Executive the next year) went on to become the party's two leading advocates of research and demographics.

A series of Guardian articles are below, demonstrating the impact of the rebranding.

[[File:Flagge Reichsbanner 2013.jpg|thumb|Reichsbanner flag]]

The '''Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁaɪçsˌbanɐ ˈʃvaʁts ˈʁoːt ˈɡɔlt|lang}}, ''"Black, Red, Gold Banner of the [[Reich]]"'') was an organization in Germany during the [[Weimar Republic]], formed by members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], the [[Centre Party (Germany)|German Centre Party]], and the (liberal) [[German Democratic Party]] in 1924. Its goal was to defend [[parliamentary democracy]] against internal subversion and [[extremism]] from the left and right, to teach the population to respect the new [[Weimar Republic|Republic]], to honor its [[Flag of Germany|flag]] and the [[Weimar Constitution|constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Das Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold|url=https://www.dhm.de/lemo/kapitel/weimarer-republik/innenpolitik/reichsbanner-schwarz-rot-gold.html|publisher=''LeMO''|date=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reichsbanner 1924 bis 1933|url=https://reichsbanner.de/reichsbanner-geschichte/|publisher=''reichsbanner.de''|date=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name is derived from the [[Flag of Germany]] adopted in 1919, the colors of which were associated with liberal parliamentary democracy and the republic, and themselves had first appeared together on a state flag, within a German-ethnicity [[sovereign state]] [[Principality of Reuss-Greiz|in 1778]].

While the Reichsbanner was set up as a multiparty organization, it came to be strongly associated with the Social Democratic Party and viewed as their [[paramilitary]] force. The headquarters of the Reichsbanner was located in [[Magdeburg]], but it had branches elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;On its regional organization, especially in the state of Saxony, see Carsten Voigt: Das Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold in Sachsen 1924 bis 1933, in: [[Jahrbuch für Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No.III/2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reichsbanner's main opponents were the [[Communist Party of Germany]] and their [[Rotfrontkämpferbund]] on the left, and the [[Nazi Party]] and their [[Sturmabteilung]] on the right. Following the Nazi takeover, Reichsbanner members played a central role in the anti-Nazi resistance.&lt;ref name="berlinde"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rede des Bundesvorsitzenden des Reichsbanners Schwarz-Rot-Gold Dr. jur. Volkmar Zühlsdorff|url=https://www.berlin.de/ba-charlottenburg-wilmersdorf/aktuelles/reden/artikel.199600.php|publisher=''Berlin.de''|date=14 October 2001|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kampf gegen den Nationalsozialismus 1930 – 1933|url=http://reichsbanner.de/reichsbanner-geschichte/bekenntnis-zur-republik/nationalsozialismus/|publisher=''reichsbanner.de''|date=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reichsbanner was re-established in 1953, as Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, Bund aktiver Demokraten e.V. as an association for political education.

== Establishment and objectives ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-08218, Verfassungsfeier, Hörsing vor dem Berliner Schloss.jpg|thumb|Meeting in 1929]]
Right wing and nationalist armed groups, like the [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]] or the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], as well as the left-wing Communist [[Rotfrontkämpferbund|Red Front Fighters]] had continued to radicalize and intensify the political struggle in Germany. The Reichsbanner was initially formed in reaction to the far right's [[Beer Hall Putsch|"Beer Hall" Putsch]] and far left's [[Hamburg Uprising|Hamburg rebellion]], both failed [[coups d'etat|coups]], which had taken place at the end of 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gefährdung der Weimarer Republik|url=http://reichsbanner.de/reichsbanner-geschichte/bewahrung-der-republik/gefaehrdung/|publisher=''reichsbanner.de''|date=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February 1924 members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], the [[Centre Party (Germany)|German Centre Party]], the [[German Democratic Party]] and trade unionists in Magdeburg established the ''Reichsbanner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gründung des Reichsbanners Schwarz-Rot-Gold|url=http://reichsbanner.de/reichsbanner-geschichte/bewahrung-der-republik/gruendung/|publisher=''reichsbanner.de''|date=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the proportion of Social Democrats in the membership clearly outweighed all others, with estimates of up to 90 per cent.

''Reichsbanner'' was a veterans' federation, in which former soldiers of the First World War enlisted their military experience in the service of the republic. It thus saw its main task as the defense of the Weimar Republic against enemies from the National Socialist, monarchist and Communist camps. Social Democratic politician [[Otto Hörsing]] designated ''Reichsbanner'' in 1931 as a 'non-partisan protection organization of the Republic and democracy in the fight against the swastika and the Soviet star'.&lt;ref&gt;Zitiert nach Franz Osterroth, Dieter Schuster: [http://library.fes.de/fulltext/bibliothek/chronik/band2/e235f826.html ''Chronik der deutschen Sozialdemokratie. 2. Vom Beginn der Weimarer Republik bis zum Ende des Zweiten Weltkrieges'']; Berlin [u.a.] 1980&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; Elektronische Ausgabe: Bonn: FES-Library (Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung), 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Members saw themselves as guardians of the inheritance of Germany's democratic tradition, going back to the [[1848 revolutions in germany|Revolutions of 1848]], and of the constitutional national colors: black, red and gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In der Tradition der Revolution von 1848|url=http://reichsbanner.de/reichsbanner-geschichte/bewahrung-der-republik/tradition/|publisher=''reichsbanner.de''|date=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and organisation==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
In the ''Reichsbanner'', two organizational structures existed in parallel: the political as a registered political association and the operational as a fighting force.

The political organization was headed by the Federal Administration comprising a 1st and 2nd chairman, three deputies, the federal treasurer, federal cashier, secretary, technical manager, federal youth leader, the sitting representatives and 15 assessors. The Federal Chairman was from 3 June 1932 Otto Hörsing. His deputy and later successor was Karl Höltermann. Beneath the federal level, Germany was divided up into ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gaus]]'', circles, districts and finally local associations. The executive committees of all organizational levels were elected from the membership of the all republican parties in concert.

Parallel to it, the operational organization was modeled as a military structure. The smallest unit was the group, with a group leader and eight men. Two to five groups formed a platoon (''Zug''), two to three courses formed a ''Kameradschaft'', which corresponded to a company of the army, between two and five of which constituted a department (''Abteilung'') with two to five departments making up a district. At least two districts formed a circle. At ''Gau'' and federal level operational and political level structures overlapped so that The Federal Chairman was at the same time also Federal Commander, while each of the 32 ''Gau'' chairmen was also ''Gauführer''. The command personnel of the operational organisation were also recognized by badges of rank. The Federal Commander, for example, wore on his lower sleeve the federal eagle (black on a red field, with golden circular border) and two black-red-golden stripes over all.

According to the organization's own records, membership in 1932 was put at three million.

==Fight for the Republic, 1930–1933==
Following substantial Nazi electoral successes in 1930, the ''Reichsbanner'' in September sought to strengthen itself against intensified street violence by SA units with a restructuring of the operational organization. Active members were divided into master formations (''Stafo'') and the elite units into protection formations (''Schufo''). In addition there were the "Young Banners". 250,000 men belonged to the Schufos in Spring 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Schutzformationen des Reichsbanners Schwarz-Rot-Gold|url=http://reichsbanner.de/reichsbanner-geschichte/kampf-um-die-republik/schutzformationen/|publisher=''reichsbanner.de''|date=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 1931, the ''Reichsbanner'', the Workers' Gymnastic and Sporting Federation (ATSB), the General German Trade Union Federation (ADGB), and the Social Democratic Party formed the [[Iron Front]], within which armed defensive operations were the responsibility of ''Reichsbanner'' and which became increasingly important in view of ever more intensifying acts of violence by members of the Nazi SA and the Communist Red Front (RFB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Eiserne Front|url=http://reichsbanner.de/reichsbanner-geschichte/kampf-um-die-republik/eiserne-front/|publisher=''reichsbanner.de''|date=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last federal general assembly of the ''Reichsbanner'' met on 17–18 February 1933 in Berlin. In March ''Reichsbanner'' and the Iron Front were banned throughout the Reich. The membership of both organizations were systematically hunted down for deportation to concentration camps and partially exterminated.&lt;ref name=berlinde /&gt;

Following the banning of the ''Reichsbanner'', some members joined the [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten]], which led to an incident where a mass signup in Braunschweig was raided by the Nazis, who called it the [[Stahlhelm Putsch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Fateful Alliance: German Conservatives and Nazis in 1933: The Machtergreifung in a New Light|author=Hermann Beck|page=271|isbn=1-84545-680-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reichsbanner members in the Resistance==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
In the now illegal underground organisations, the organisation's membership, in particular the former ''Schufos'' represented an important component in the Social Democratic resistance to the Nazi regime, for example the groups centred on [[Theodor Haubach]] and Karl Heinrich in Berlin and around Walter Schmedemann in Hamburg as well as the Socialist Front in Hanover.

A '''rump party''' is a [[political party]] that is formed by the remaining body of supporters and leaders who do not support a breakaway group who merge with or form another new party.
The rump party can have the name of the original party, or a new name.

Examples:
* The pro-[[protectionism]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the UK after the breakaway of the [[free trade]] [[Peelite]] faction in 1846 over the repeal of the [[corn laws]].
* [[United Labour Party (New Zealand)|United Labour Party]] in New Zealand which had a remnant made up of moderates who did not join the new, more radical, [[Social Democratic Party (New Zealand)|Social Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/political-parties/page-15 |title=[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]] |chapter=Social Democratic Party | first=Bernard John |last=Foster |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage|Ministry for Culture and Heritage / Te Manatū Taonga]] | editor-first=A.

* [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)]]
* [[Communist Party of Britain]]
* [[National Party (South Africa)]] under leadership of [[DF Malan]] after formation of [[United Party (South Africa)]].
* [[New National Party (South Africa)]] the new name of what remained of [[National Party (South Africa)]] under the leadership of [[FW de Klerk]] and [[Marthinus van Schalkwyk]].
* [[Progressive Canadian Party]], under [[Ernie Schreiber]] and now [[Sinclair Stevens]], the remnants of the former [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] that opposed the merger with the [[Canadian Alliance]].
* The ''Rassemblement-UMP'' (Gathering-Union for a Popular Movement) is an ephemeral French legislative group, led by former Prime Minister [[François Fillon]], which split from the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] on November 2012 after the internal contestation which followed the election of the party's president. Created on November the 27, 2012, this dissident group has been reintegrated in the UMP's parlementary group after negotiations between the two rivals on January the 16, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france24.com/en/20121127-media-mediawatch-ump-rump-fillon-cope&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/politique/20130115.OBS5401/le-r-ump-c-est-bel-et-bien-fini.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solidarity lending''' is a [[Loan|lending]] practice where small groups borrow collectively and group members encourage one another to repay. It is an important building block of [[microfinance]].

==Operations==
Solidarity lending takes place through 'solidarity groups'.  These groups are a distinctive banking [[distribution (business)|distribution channel]] used primarily to deliver [[microcredit]] to poor people.  Solidarity lending lowers the costs to a financial institution related to assessing, managing and collecting loans, and can eliminate the need for [[collateral (finance)|collateral]].  Since there is a [[fixed cost]] associated with each loan delivered, a bank that bundles individual loans together and permits a group to manage individual relationships can realize substantial savings in administrative and management costs.

In many developing countries the legal system offers little, if any support for the property rights of poor people.  Laws related to [[secured transactions]] – a cornerstone of Western banking – may also be absent or unenforced.  Instead, solidarity lending levers various types of [[social capital]] like peer pressure, mutual support and a healthy culture of repayment.  These characteristics make solidarity lending more useful in rural villages than in urban centres where mobility is greater and social capital is weaker.

Efforts to replicate solidarity lending in developed countries have generally not succeeded.  For example, the [[Calmeadow Foundation]] tested an analogous 'peer lending' model in three locations in Canada:  rural Nova Scotia and urban Toronto and Vancouver during the 1990s.  It concluded that a variety of factors – including difficulties in reaching the target market, the high risk profile of clients, their general distaste for the joint liability requirement, and high overhead costs – made solidarity lending unviable without subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Frankiewicz.  "Calmeadow Metrofund:  A Canadian Experiment in Sustainable Microfinance", Calmeadow Foundation, April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, debates have continued about whether the required subsidies may be justified as an alternative to other subsidies targeted to the entrepreneurial poor, and [[Vancity|VanCity Credit Union]], which took over Calmeadow's Vancouver operations, continues to use peer lending.

==Distinctiveness==
Tapping social capital to lend money is not new to [[microfinance]].  Earlier precedents include the [[informal economy|informal]] practices of [[Rotating Savings and Credit Association|ROSCAs]] and the [[bond of association|bonds of association]] used in [[credit unions]].  In India, the practice of [[Self-help group (finance)|self-help group banking]] is inspired by similar principles.

However, solidarity groups are distinctly different from earlier approaches in several important ways.

First, solidarity groups are very small, typically involving 5 individuals who are allowed to choose one another but cannot be related.  Five is often cited as an ideal size because it is:
* small enough to ensure a maximum level of joint responsibility and discourage [[free rider problem|free riders]], and
* large enough to prevent the misfortune or incompetence of one person from causing the group to collapse.

Much evidence has also shown that social pressure is more effective among women than among men.  The vast majority of loans using this methodology are delivered to women.

Learning from the failure of the [[Comilla Model]] of cooperative credit piloted by [[Akhtar Hameed Khan]] in the 1950s and '60s, [[Grameen Bank]] and many other [[microcredit]] institutions have also taken an assertive approach to targeting poor women and excluding non-poor individuals entirely.

{{quote|A major reason for the prior failure of credit cooperatives in Bangladesh was that the groups were too big and consisted of people with varied economic backgrounds.  These large groups did not work because the more affluent members captured the organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Asif Dowla &amp; Dipal Barua.  ''The Poor Always Pay Back:  The Grameen II Story'' Kumarian Press Inc., Bloomfield, Connecticut, 2006, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Grameen Bank==
An early pioneer of solidarity lending, [[Muhammad Yunus|Dr. Muhammad Yunus]] of [[Grameen Bank]] in [[Bangladesh]] describes the dynamics of lending through solidarity groups this way:

{{quote|... Group membership not only creates support and protection but also smooths out the erratic behavior patterns of individual members, making each borrower more reliable in the process.  Subtle and at times not-so-subtle peer pressure keeps each group member in line with the broader objectives of the credit program. …  Because the group approves the loan request of each member, the group assumes moral responsibility for the loan.  If any member of the group gets into trouble, the group usually comes forward to help.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Yunus (with Alan Jolis).  ''Banker to the Poor:  Micro-lending and the battle against world poverty'', Public Affairs, NewYork, 1999, pp. 62-63&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Grameen approach uses solidarity groups as its primary building block.  However, responsibility for delinquent loans is handled by the elected leaders of a larger, village-level group called a 'centre' composed of eight solidarity groups.  Because all the members are from the same village and loan payments take place during the centre meeting, the principle of using social capital for leverage is not compromised; the only difference is that all the members of the centre are collectively responsible for unpaid loans.&lt;ref&gt;Beatriz Armendáriz de Aghion &amp; Jonathan Morduch.  ''The Economics of Microfinance'', The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2005, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[microcredit]] institutions use solidarity groups essentially as a form of [[joint liability]].  That is, they will take any action practical to collect a seriously delinquent loan not just from the individual member, but from any member of the solidarity group with the capability to repay it.  But Yunus has always rejected this concept, arguing that whatever moral responsibility may pertain among group members, there is no formal or legal "... form of joint liability, i.e. group members are not responsible to pay on behalf of a defaulting member."&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Yunus.  ''Grameen Bank at a Glance'', Grameen Bank, Dhaka, September, 2006, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Solidarity lending is widespread in microfinance today, particularly in Asia.  In addition to Grameen Bank, major practitioners include [[SEWA]], [[Bank Rakyat Indonesia]], [[Accion International]], [[FINCA]], [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] and [[SANASA]].  The Calmeadow Foundation was another important pioneer.

The ''Microbanking Bulletin'' tracks solidarity lending as a separate microfinance methodology.  Of 446 microfinance institutions worldwide that it was tracking at the end of 2005, 39 lent only through this method, while another 205 used a mix of solidarity and individual lending.  The average loan balance outstanding at solidarity lenders was $109 (19% of local [[gross national income]]), compared to $1,024 (61% of local gross national income) among individual lenders.  This shows not only that solidarity lenders are meeting the needs of a significantly poorer market segment, but also that they are doing it in significantly poorer countries.&lt;ref&gt;''Microbanking Bulletin'', Issue #13, Autumn, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Costa Rica]], many companies enable their employees to organize ''Asociaciones Solidaristas'' ([[Solidarism Association]]s), which enables them to create saving funds, loans, and financial activities (for example managing the company's coffee shop) with financial support from the company. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solidarismo.or.cr/ "Movimiento Solidarista Costarricense"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Solidarity lending has clearly had a positive impact on many borrowers. Without it, many would not have borrowed at all, or would have been forced to rely on [[loan sharks]]. However, it has been the subject of much criticism. A recent survey of the empirical research concludes that the search for alternative approaches must continue, and highlights problems such as "borrowers growing frustrated at the cost of attending regular meetings, loan officers refusing to sanction good borrowers who happen to be in 'bad' groups, and constraints imposed by the diverging ambitions of group members."&lt;ref&gt;Beatriz Armendáriz de Aghion &amp; Jonathan Morduch, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to ensure that all members of solidarity groups are equally poor may not always improve group performance.  Greater socio-economic diversity "means that group members' incomes are less likely to vary together, and thus group members' ability to insure each other increases".&lt;ref&gt;Beatriz Armendáriz de Aghion &amp; Jonathan Morduch, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;  The solidarity lending approach, which excludes less-poor borrowers, was adopted in large part because of a view that the more inclusive cooperative 'bond of association' had failed in Bangladesh (see the Comilla Model).  But the founder of Bangladesh's credit cooperatives, [[Akhter Hameed Khan]] documented that the Model's practices contravened two fundamental credit union operating principles: independence from government intervention, and local financial self-reliance.&lt;ref&gt;Akhter Hameed Khan.  ''The Works of Akhter Hameed Khan, Vol II.  Rural Development Approaches and the Comilla Model''.  Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development, Comilla, 1983, pp. 190-92&lt;/ref&gt;  The case that the 'inclusive' approach to organizational development used by the Comilla Model accounts for its failure has not been made.

While poverty-targeting has had many successes, social solidarity is not solely a tool for the lending institution – it can also be used by borrowers.  A loan 'strike', if it gains the sympathy of a large number of borrowers, can lead to a rapid and highly unstabilizing escalation in delinquencies.  It was this type of circumstance that led in 1998, to the rapid escalation of delinquency at Grameen Bank that resulted in the redesign dubbed 'Grameen II'.&lt;ref&gt;Asif Dowla &amp; Dipal Barua.  ''The Poor Always Pay Back:  The Grameen II Story'' Kumarian Press Inc., Bloomfield, Connecticut, 2006, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

The photo above – of a group of women seated in rows on the ground before a male NGO-officer who sits in a chair processing their payments – encapsulates another common critique.  Solidarity groups may be composed entirely of women, but the staff who decide when and if they receive financial services are often dominated by males.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6119">'''Tamsin Blanchard''' is a British fashion journalist, author, and lecturer. She is particularly known for her work on sustainability and ecological issues in fashion.

==Early life and education==
Blanchard was born in Liverpool and took a fashion journalism course at [[Central Saint Martins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tamsin Blanchard|url=https://www.harpercollins.com/cr-105489/tamsin-blanchard|website=HarperCollins US|accessdate=14 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism==
In 1998 Blanchard started up a biannual fashion and visual arts magazine titled ''IT'', for which she was publisher and co-editor.&lt;ref name=ecosalon/&gt; She was also at ''[[The Independent]]'' as a fashion editor, and from 1999 to 2005 was Style Editor at ''[[The Observer]]''. She then joined ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as style director for their magazine.&lt;ref name=gs&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saunders|first1=Grace|title=Family Life Made Easy |date=2010 |publisher=Random House |isbn=9780099519362 |page=154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fuV2TPvdyQYC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ecosalon/&gt;

The [[Fashion Museum, Bath]], chose Blanchard as the fashion journalist to select the most defining looks of 1996 for their [[Dress of the Year]] collection. She picked out an [[Alexander McQueen]] tunic and 'bumster' trousers from his "Hunger" collection for the womenswear look, and a man's [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]] electric blue two-piece suit and shirt.&lt;ref name=rl&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lester |first1=Richard |title=Dress of the year|date=2013|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club |isbn=9781851497256 |pages=134-165}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the press launch, the clothes were modelled by [[Jimmy Pursey]] and his then partner Tizer Bailey, the model who had originally worn the McQueen ensemble in the designer's catwalk presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blanchard |first1=Tamsin |title=Posterity |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/posterity-1354158.html|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=The Independent |date=25 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchard said at the time that McQueen, who had recently succeeded [[John Galliano]] as the designer for [[Givenchy]], was one of the strongest representations of mid-nineties "cutting-edge style," whilst Smith's suit represented the revolution in menswear where the male consumer was increasingly aware of labels and design.&lt;ref name=rl/&gt;

Blanchard is also a fashion correspondent for the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]'s magazine and a contributing editor to ''[[10 Magazine (British magazine)|10 Magazine]].'' She has also contributed to ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Marie Claire]]'', ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Rubbish (magazine)|Rubbish]]''.&lt;ref name=ecosalon/&gt; 

Blanchard has been invited to teach fashion journalism at the [[University of Westminster]] and Central Saint Martins.&lt;ref name=ecosalon/&gt;&lt;ref name=gs/&gt;

==Author==
Blanchard's best-known book is probably ''Green is the New Black: How to Change the World with Style'', published in 2007 and dealing with ecological awareness in a fashion-conscious lifestyle. [[TreeHugger]] reviewed the book favourably, noting that while Blanchard was not as authoritative on eco-issues as [[Lucy Siegle]], she had still written a well-informed, fair-handed book that wrote accessibly about how to be both fashion-conscious and environmentally aware,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alter |first1=Bonnie |title=Book Review:  Green is the New Black |url=https://www.treehugger.com/culture/book-review-green-is-the-new-black.html |accessdate=14 August 2017 |work=TreeHugger |date=10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the EcoSalon website listed it as among their top 15 books on eco-fashion.&lt;ref name=ecosalon&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dufault |first1=Amy |title=Top 15 Eco-Fashion Books We Love|url=http://ecosalon.com/top-15-eco-fashion-books/|website=EcoSalon|date=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a reviewer for ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' dismissed the book as "utter pointlessness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Victoria |title=What's a girl to do in these tricky times?|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-504033/What-s-girl-tricky-times.html |accessdate=14 August 2017 |work=The Daily Mail |date=2 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book established Blanchard as an authority on the subject of eco-consciousness in fashion, leading to her being approached for commentary on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grant |first1=Linda|title=Cheap at twice the price |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/29/fashion.ethicalliving |accessdate=14 August 2017|work=The Guardian|date=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1528">The '''Treaty of Lutatius''' officially ended the [[First Punic War]]. It received its name from [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] consul and victor of the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands]] who negotiated it with a subordinate of [[Hamilcar Barca]] in 241 BC. According to the historian [[Polybius]], the terms of the accord dictated that [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] must evacuate [[Sicily]], not make war upon [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] or its allies, hand over all prisoners taken during the war, and pay an indemnity of 2200 [[talent (weight)|talents]] (66 tons) of silver in 20 annual installments. Originally rejected by the Roman people, these terms were eventually adopted with very little change under the authority of Quintus Lutatius Cerco, the brother of Gaius Lutatius Catulus. In the final agreement, Carthage was only given ten years to pay an indemnity of 3200 talents (96 tons), and had to evacuate the islands between [[Sicily]] and [[Italy]] ([[Ustica]] and the [[Aeolian Islands]]) and [[Aegadian Islands]] off western coast of Sicily.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5484">The '''Vaccine Safety Datalink Project''' (VSD) was established in 1990 by the [[United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to study the [[adverse effect]]s of [[vaccine]]s.

Four large [[health maintenance organization]]s, including [[Kaiser Permanente]], were initially recruited to provide the CDC with medical data on [[vaccination]] histories, health outcomes, and subject characteristics.  The VSD database contains data compiled from [[surveillance]] on more than seven million people in the [[United States]], including about 500,000 children from birth through age six years (2% of the U.S. population in this age group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chen RT |title=Vaccine Safety Datalink project: a new tool for improving vaccine safety monitoring in the United States.

The VSD data-sharing program is now being administered by the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] Research Data Center.  The data sharing guidelines have been revised to include comments from interested groups as well as recommendations from the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM).

Of some 12 to 13 million inhabitants in the area, it is estimated  that 48 per cent understand Occitan, 28 per cent can speak it, about 9 per cent of the population use it on a daily basis, 13 per cent can read and 6 per cent can write the language.'&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th to 18th century==
Beginning in 1539 with Art. 111 of the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/villers-cotterets.asp Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêt]&lt;/ref&gt; non-French languages in France were reduced in stature when it became compulsory "to deliver and execute all [legal] acts in the French language" (''de prononcer et expedier tous actes en langaige françoys''). Originally meant as a way to eliminate [[Latin]] in official documents — few 16th-century French subjects were educated and familiar with Latin — it also stated that French and only French was legal in the kingdom (''en langage maternel françoys et non aultrement'').

==Late 18th to late 19th century==
===Abbé Grégoire's "Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois"===
The deliberate process of eradicating non-French [[vernacular]]s in modern France and disparaging them as mere local and often strictly oral dialects was formalized with [[Henri Grégoire]]'s ''Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalise the use of the French language'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.languefrancaise.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=66 |title=Abbé Grégoire's ''Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalize the use of the French language'' |access-date=2008-04-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405022802/http://www.languefrancaise.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=66 |archive-date=2008-04-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which he presented on June 4, 1794 to the [[National Convention]]; thereafter, all languages other than French were officially banned in the administration and schools for the sake of [[linguistics|linguistically]] uniting post-[[Bastille Day]] France. At the time, only one tenth of the population were fluent in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gwalarn.org/brezhoneg/istor/gregoire.html |title=L'Abbé Grégoire en guerre contre les "Patois", Hervé Luxardo, gwalarn.org |access-date=2007-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609025249/http://www.gwalarn.org/brezhoneg/istor/gregoire.html |archive-date=2007-06-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to "patois", [[Jean Jaurès]] famously claimed that "one names ''patois'' the language of a defeated nation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rleb07.free.fr/opinions/vecteur.html A new "Common Vector", Robert L.E. Billon, April 2000, rleb07.free.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Chambers Dictionary]]'', the origin of the term is disputed but could be a "corruption of ''patrois'', from [[Vulgar Latin|LL]] ''patriensis'', a local inhabitant".

Four months earlier (January 27), [[Bertrand Barère]], although an Occitan from [[Tarbes]] himself, claimed before this same Convention:
{{quote|The monarchy had reasons to resemble the [[Tower of Babel]]; in [[democracy]], leaving the citizens to ignore the national language [that of Paris], unable to control the power, is betraying the motherland... For a free people, the tongue must be one and the same for everyone. [...] How much money have we not spent already for the translation of the laws of the first two [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|national assemblies]] in the various dialects of France! As if it were our duty to maintain those barbaric jargons and those coarse lingos that can only serve fanatics and [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]] now!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/Europe/france-2politik_francais.htm L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde – La politique linguistique du français, www.tlfq.ulaval.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The end of traditional provinces===
This policy can be noted by the way France's internal borders were redrawn, creating 83 [[Departments of France|''départements'']]. The law was passed on December 22, 1789 and took effect the following year, on March 4, 1790. As a result, the centuries-old singularities of the various Occitan-speaking parts were overlooked and shaken in a deliberate effort by the newly formed government to weaken and parcel out long-established feudal domains so that republican France would subdue traditional allegiances, as [[Antonin Perbòsc]] reveals in the Foreword to his ''Anthologie'':
{{quote|When the ''Constituante'' ([[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]) created the ''départements'', their goal was clearly to erase the old geographical and historical distinction of the provinces; however this goal was not as perfectly met as some would have liked: in general, the ''départements'' were made up of pieces of existing provinces, quite seldom of the reunion of parts from different provinces. If one could criticize this territorial division for being too arbitrary and too geometric, what can be said of [[Tarn-et-Garonne]], born of a ''sénatus-consule'' (a law by the [[Senate (France)|Senate of France]]) on November 2, 1808? Of course, one may think that the ''Centralisateur'' ([[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]) felt real pleasure showing he could do even better than the ''centralisateurs'' of the National Constituent Assembly. With fragments of [[Quercy]], [[Rouergue]], [[Agen]]ais, [[Lomagne]], [[Gascony]] and [[Languedoc]], creating a new unit so little vast and yet so diverse of soil, language and race, what a great idea! And maybe the audacious half-god had only one regret: coming a little too late to redesign according to this pattern all the provinces of old France...&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Georges Labouysse's ''Histoire de France: L'Imposture. Mensonges et manipulations de l'Histoire officielle'' p. 234. IEO Edicions&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 20th century, the ''départements'' were grouped into ''[[Regions of France|régions]]'', to create a level of government between the departmental and national. While the ''régions'' were intended to replace the old provinces, they were not necessarily formed along the same boundaries. As the map shows, there were eleven Occitan-speaking enclaves in the pre-1789 state, such as the powerful lands of [[Languedoc]] and [[Gascony]], but they were divided into seven ''régions'' with no regard whatsoever for cultural and linguistic identities. This is how [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] was created out of portions of five Occitan provinces and three capitals were scrapped in favour of [[Marseille]]; and [[Auvergne]] came to comprise both native and ''langues d'oïl'' entities. Meanwhile, the city of [[Nantes]] was administratively removed from [[Brittany]], of which it had been one of two traditional capitals (along with [[Rennes]]), and the city of [[Toulouse]] was not included in the ''région'' of [[Languedoc-Roussillon]], though it had historically been located in that province.

Many of the ''régions'' contain hyphenated names, reflecting the merging of multiple historically distinct areas.  This is true for four of the seven ''régions'' of Occitania: Languedoc-Roussillon, [[Midi-Pyrénées]], Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur and [[Rhône-Alpes]].

==Late 19th century – Policies and legacy of Jules Ferry==
===School discipline===
In the 1880s, [[Jules Ferry]] implemented a series of strict measures to further weaken ''regional'' languages in France, as shown in Bernard Poignant's 1998 report to [[Lionel Jospin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chez.com/buan1/poignant.htm LANGUES ET CULTURES REGIONALES – Rapport de Monsieur Bernard Poignant – Maire de Quimper A Monsieur Lionel Jospin – Premier Ministre Le 1er juillet 1998, chez.com]&lt;/ref&gt; These included children being given [[punishments]] by their teachers for speaking Occitan in a [[Toulouse]] school or [[Breton language|Breton]] in [[Brittany]]. Art. 30 of ''Loi d'éducation française'' (French Teaching Law, 1851) stated that: "It is strictly forbidden to speak patois during classes or breaks."

[[File:SpeakFrenchBeClean.jpg|thumb|right|"Speak French, Be Clean" written on the wall of the [[Ayguatébia-Talau]] school]]

Among other well-known humiliations was ''clogging'' young rebels, namely hanging a clog (''sabot'') around their necks as this young lady recalls her grandparents telling her:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~SuuHialat/hialat3c.html |title=Ecoles Diwan, la bosse du breton|last=de la Casinière|first=Nicolas|date=October 1, 1998|language=fr|accessdate=2008-06-28 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19991014020922/http://members.tripod.com/~SuuHialat/hialat3c.html |archivedate=1999-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My grandparents speak Breton too, though not with me. As children, they used to [[Rulering (punishment)|have their fingers smacked]] if they happened to say a word in Breton. Back then, the French of the Republic, one and indivisible, was to be heard in all schools and those who dared challenge this policy were humiliated with having to wear a clog around their necks or kneel down on a ruler under a sign that read: "It is forbidden to spit on the ground and speak Breton".&lt;ref&gt;[http://bretagne.lalibreblogs.be/media/01/00/3d75e7dbef78f875f7cc337be5138241.jpg An example sign at bretagne.lalibreblogs.be]. The sign reads (in French): "To all school pupils: It is forbidden 1. to speak Breton and spit on the ground; 2. to wet your fingers with your mouth to turn the pages of books and notebooks; 3. to insert the tip of a pen or penholder into your ear; 4. to clean your slates with your spit or directly with your tongue; 5. to hold pens, penholders, coins etc between your lips. Now do you want to know why these things are forbidden? Ask your teachers: they will give you the necessary explanations. And remember your duty is not just to obey these rules but to make sure everyone else applies them."&lt;/ref&gt; That's the reason why some older folks won't transmit the language to their children: it brings trouble upon yourself...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This practice was referred to as [[Symbole|le symbole]] by officials and "la vache" (the cow) by pupils, with offenders becoming "vachards". Many objects were used, not just clogs: horseshoes, shingles, slates, wooden plates with a message, coins with a cross on them. The following are official instructions from a [[Finistère]] sub-prefect to teachers in 1845: "And remember, Gents: you were given your position in order to kill the Breton language."&lt;ref name="France pp. 90-92"&gt;Georges Labouysse in ''Histoire de France: L'Imposture. Mensonges et manipulations de l'Histoire officielle'' pp. 90–92. IEO Edicions&lt;/ref&gt; The prefect of [[Basses-Pyrénées]] in the French [[Northern Basque Country|Basque Country]] wrote in 1846: "Our schools in the Basque Country are particularly meant to substitute the [[Basque language]] with French..."&lt;ref name="France pp. 90-92"/&gt;

Resorting to the practice of ''clogging'' is confirmed by the Autonomes de Solidarité Laïques website:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonome-solidarite.fr/?fas-usu=tribune&amp;type=politique&amp;id=1497 La neutralité politique, philosophique et religieuse et l’école, Autonomes de Solidarité Laïques website]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
School has had a unifying role inasmuch as speaking the "noble" language [French] reduced the use of regional dialects and ''patois''. Let us mention the humiliation of children made to wear a clog around their necks for inadvertently speaking a word in the language of the people.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As for signs, they were also found in [[Poitou]] schools:&lt;ref&gt;[http://parlange.free.fr/pages/bas_poitevin.html Parlange : témoignages sur les patois du Bas-Poitou, parlange.free.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It seems as though Jules Ferry making school free and compulsory in 1881 materialized the work started four centuries earlier [with the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]]]; the method of repression and humiliation that was undertaken bore fruit with, for instance, the famous signs in school reading: "It is forbidden to spit on the ground and speak ''patois''."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Conselh de Representacion Generala de la Joventut d'Òc (CRGJOC, General Representation Council of the Occitan Youth), through the Youth of European Nationalities website,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050421083901/http://www.yeni.org/default.php?s=members&amp;p=members/membersitem.php&amp;id=204&amp;m=&amp;l=english Conselh de Representacion Generala de la Joventut d'Òc (CRGJOC) : Organization, at the Youth of European Nationalities Website]&lt;/ref&gt; reports that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our language [Occitan] lost its name, becoming some "''patois''", first at school and then in families through putting pressure on women in education ("''Interdit de cracher par terre et de parler patois''") with the French Third Republic, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and [[Francisco Franco|Franco]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Confolentés Occitan (Occitan-speaking [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]]) website &lt;ref&gt;[http://ujan.free.fr/englOc2.htm Occitan : a short history, Confolentés Occitan website (ujan.free.fr)]&lt;/ref&gt; testifies of the methods used by French authorities over the past century or so:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To help efface traditional regional identities, the Occitan language was not merely discouraged but actively suppressed. School pupils were punished well within living memory for speaking their native language on school premises.

The French administration managed to make the Occitan speakers think of their own language as a patois, i.e. as a corrupted form of French used only by the ignorant and uneducated. This alienating process is known as ''la vergonha'' ("the shame").

Many older speakers of Occitan still believe that their native language is no more than a shameful patois. This is one reason why you rarely hear it in public — or anywhere outside of the neighbourhood or family circle.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the school of Camélas in [[Northern Catalonia]], a former pupil reports,&lt;ref&gt;''Quatre femmes en Roussillon'', TV show, 1st April 1973&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Everyone but the teacher's children spoke [[Catalan language|Catalan]] among themselves. We'd even get punished for that, because at the time, we all had to speak French. ''Be Clean, Speak French'' could be found written on the school's walls. And if you refused to speak French, they'd give you some sort of wooden sign to wear ''until death came'', as we said, which meant the last offender, in the evening, had twenty lines to copy. We'd speak French in the schoolyard, and for the first ten metres of the way back home, for as long as we thought the teacher would overhear us, and then we'd switch back to our own mother tongue, Catalan.

In those times, Catalan speakers were rather despised. My generation associated speaking Catalan with a disadvantage, with being less than the others, with running the risk of being left behind on the social ladder, in short with bringing trouble.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abbé Grégoire's own terms were kept to designate the languages of France: while Breton referred to the language spoken in Brittany, the word ''patois'' encompassed all [[Romance languages|Romance]] ''dialects'' such as Occitan and [[Franco-Provençal]]. In his report, [[Corsican language|Corsican]] and [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]] were dismissed as "highly degenerate" (''très-dégénérés'') forms of [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[German language|German]], respectively. As a result, some people still call their non-French language ''patois'', encouraged by the fact they were never taught how to write it and made to think only French exists in the written form.

===Pressure on the church===
In 1902, in a speech before the ''[[Conseil général#Administrative role|Conseil Général]]'' of [[Morbihan]], Chief Education Officer Dantzer recommended that "the Church give [[first communion]] only to French-speaking children".&lt;ref name="livre-blanc-et-noir-de-la-langue-bretonne"&gt;[http://www.kervarker.org/fr/levr_27_period.html Livre blanc et noir de la langue bretonne, kervarker.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, prime minister [[Émile Combes]], himself an Occitan, told the prefects of Morbihan, [[Côtes-d'Armor|Côtes-du-Nord]] and [[Finistère]]&lt;ref name="livre-blanc-et-noir-de-la-langue-bretonne" /&gt; that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Breton priests want to keep their flock in ignorance by refusing to promote education and using only the Breton language in religious teachings and [[catechism]]. The Bretons will only be part of the Republic the day they start speaking French.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mid-20th century to the present==
As the doctor in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[philology]] and professor at the [[University of the Balearic Islands]] [[Jaume Corbera Pou]] argues,&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dodeparaula.blogspot.com/search?q=patu%C3%A8s&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When at the mid-19th century, primary school is made compulsory all across the State, it is also made clear that only French will be taught, and the teachers will severely punish any pupil speaking in ''patois''. The aim of the French educational system will consequently not be to dignify the pupils' natural humanity, developing their culture and teaching them to write their language, but rather to humiliate them and morally degrade them for the simple fact of being what tradition and their nature made them. The self-proclaimed country of the "[[Human rights]]" will then ignore one of man's most fundamental rights, the right to be himself and speak the language of his nation. And with that attitude France, the "grande France" that calls itself the champion of liberty, will pass the 20th century, indifferent to the timid protest movements of the various linguistic communities it submitted and the literary prestige they may have given birth to.

[...]

France, that under [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s reign was seen here [in [[Catalonia]]] as the safe haven of freedom, has the miserable honour of being the [only] State of [[Europe]]—and probably the world — that succeeded best in the diabolical task of destroying its own ethnic and linguistic patrimony and moreover, of destroying human family bonds: many parents and children, or grandparents and grandchildren, have different languages, and the latter feel ashamed of the first because they speak a despicable ''patois'', and no element of the grandparents' culture has been transmitted to the younger generation, as if they were born out of a completely new world. This is the French State that has just entered the 21st century, a country where stone monuments and natural landscapes are preserved and respected, but where many centuries of popular creation expressed in different tongues are on the brink of extinction. The "gloire" and the "grandeur" built on a genocide. [[liberté, égalité, fraternité|No liberty, no equality, no fraternity]]: just cultural extermination, this is the real motto of the French Republic.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Constitutional issues===
In 1972, [[Georges Pompidou]], the President of France and a native of an Occitan-speaking region, declared that "there is no room for regional languages in a France whose fate is to mark Europe with its seal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurominority.eu/documents/transferts/Audition%202-3%2007%2007%20discrimination%20linguistique-1.pdf Conséquences sociales, économiques et politiques de la discrimination linguistique.

In a pre-election speech&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pactedeslangues.com/spip.php?article1824 |title=Le temps est venu d’un statut des langues et cultures de France, at pactedeslangues.com |access-date=2008-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908041134/http://pactedeslangues.com/spip.php?article1824 |archive-date=2009-09-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lorient]], on March 14, 1981, [[François Mitterrand]] asserted that:

{{quote|The time has come to give the languages and cultures of France an official status. The time has come to open school doors wide for them, to create regional radio and TV stations to let them be broadcast, to ensure they play all the role they deserve in public life.}}

These declarations however were not followed by any effective measures.
[[File:Occitan Lenga Oficiala.jpg|thumb|Pro-officiality gathering in Carcassonne]]
In 1992, after some questioned the unconstitutional segregation of minority languages in France, Art. II of the 1958 [[French Constitution]] was revised so that "the language of the Republic is French" (''la langue de la République est le français''). This was achieved only months before the [[Council of Europe]] passed the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, Strasbourg, 5.XI.1992]&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Jacques Chirac]] ignored &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/popup_print.php3?id_article=291867 Langues régionales : Jospin saisit Chirac, www.humanite.fr, June 24, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; despite [[Lionel Jospin]]'s plea for the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] to amend Art. II and include all vernacular languages spoken on French soil. Yet again, non-French languages in France were denied official recognition and deemed too dangerous for the unity of the country,&lt;ref&gt;Art. 1 of the French Constitution states that ''La France est une République indivisible, laïque, démocratique et sociale'', France is an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Occitania|Occitans]], [[Basques]], [[Corsicans]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Bretons]], [[Alsace|Alsatians]], [[County of Nice|Nissarts]], [[Savoyards]] and [[Flemings]] have still no explicit legal right to conduct public affairs in their regional languages within their home lands. The text was again refused&lt;ref&gt;[http://ouiaubreton.com/spip.php?article3466 Langues régionales : on verra plus tard, ouiaubreton.com]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Union for a Popular Movement|majority]] deputies on January 18, 2008, after the [[Académie française]] voiced their absolute disapproval&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-societe/2008-06-17/l-academie-francaise-contre-les-langues-regionales-dans-la/920/0/253644&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20080616/53482013513.html&lt;/ref&gt; of so-called regional languages, the recognition of which they perceive as "an attack on French national identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/17/france |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Local language recognition angers French academy |first=Angelique |last=Chrisafis |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] website,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070825082354/http://www.u-m-p.org/propositions/index.php?id=charte_europeene_des_langues_regionales Charte européenne des langues régionales, L'Abécédaire des propositions de Nicolas Sarkozy, UMP website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] denies any mistreatment of regional languages. In a pre-[[French presidential election, 2007|electoral]] speech in [[Besançon]] on 13 March 2007 he claimed:

{{quote|If I'm elected, I won't be in favour of the European Charter for Regional Languages. I don't want a judge with a historical experience of the issue of minorities different from ours deciding tomorrow that a regional language must be considered as a language of the Republic just like French.&lt;br&gt;Because, beyond the text itself, there is a dynamic of interpretations and jurisprudence that can go very far. I am convinced that in France, the land of freedom, no minority is discriminated against and consequently it is not necessary to grant European judges the right to give their opinion on a matter that is consubstantial with our national identity and has absolutely nothing to do with the construction of [[European Union|Europe]].}}

His [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] rival, [[Ségolène Royal]], on the contrary, declared herself ready to sign the Charter in a March 2007 speech &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sego29.over-blog.org/article-5914843.html |title=Charte des langues régionales : C'est OUI, sego29.over-blog.org |access-date=2007-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171421/http://sego29.over-blog.org/article-5914843.html |archive-date=2007-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Northern Basque Country|Iparralde]] for the sake of cultural variety in France:

{{quote|Regional identities represent a tremendous asset for the future and I believe that understanding the link between the fundamental values that make the deep-rooted identity between France and the French nation in its diversity, in its authenticity, in its authentic traditions [...] makes the State work well.}}

On 27 October 2015, the [[Senate (France)|Senate]] rejected a bill for the ratification of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], preventing the adoption of a constitutional reform that would have given a degree of official status to regional languages such as Occitan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le Sénat dit non à la Charte européenne des langues régionales|url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/actu/politique/article/le-senat-rejette-le-projet-de-loi-de-ratification-de-la-charte-europeenne-des-langues-regionales-741405|accessdate=1 November 2015|agency=franceinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pronichev also holds the title of First Deputy Director of the [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|Federal Security Service]] (FSB), the successor organization to [[KGB]].

==Biography==
Born in 1953, Pronichev served with the Border Guards as an officer in the [[Transcaucasus]], the Soviet Far East, and the Northwest Border Districts from 1974 to 1981. Subsequently, he served with the FSB in [[Karelia]] and led the FSB's [[counter-terrorism|anti-terrorism]] efforts until 1999, when he was named to his current post in the FSB.

When the Federal Border Guard Service was reorganized (in 2003) as a directorate of the FSB, Pronichev was named to lead the Border Service and retained his former title as well.

Vladimir Pronichev was the head of the FSB operation on the ground in [[Beslan]] during the [[Beslan school siege]].&lt;ref name="Satter"&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/907jbmkm.asp?pg=2 The Truth About Beslan.

Systematic Design of a Maximum Water Recovery Network for an Urban System Based on Pinch Analysis. IEM Journal. 1 (67): 57-64.&lt;/ref&gt; is a hierarchy of [[water conservation]] priorities.  Levels of the hierarchy from the highest to the lowest in terms of the priority for [[water conservation]] include elimination, reduction, outsourcing/reuse and regeneration.  The most preferred option is elimination, followed by reduction of water demand.  After that, direct reuse/recycling and water outsourcing through method such as [[rainwater harvesting]] are preferred.  This is followed by regeneration or treatment of wastewater before being reused.  Freshwater will only be used when all water-saving options have been explored.

The WMH was used as an effective screening tool in [[cost effective minimum water network]] methodology to stretch the limits of water savings beyond those achievable using conventional [[pinch analysis]] approach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8230">The '''World Network of Users and Survivors of Psychiatry''' ('''WNUSP''') is an international organisation representing, and led by what it terms "[[Psychiatric survivors movement|survivors]] of [[psychiatry]]". As of 2003, over 70 national organizations were members of WNUSP, based in 30 countries.&lt;ref name=contrib&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/rights/contrib-wnusp.htm|title=UN Enable - Promoting the rights of Persons with Disabilities - Contribution by WNUSP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network seeks to protect and develop the [[human rights]], [[disability rights]], [[dignity]] and self-determination of those [[labeling theory|labeled]] '[[Mental disorder|mentally ill]]'.

==Activities==
WNUSP has special consultative status with the [[United Nations]]. It contributed to the development of the UN's [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].&lt;ref name=contrib /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/rights/wgcontrib-wnusp.htm&lt;/ref&gt; WNUSP has produced a manual to help people use it entitled "Implementation Manual for the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities", edited by Myra Kovary.&lt;ref&gt;http://wnusp.rafus.dk/documents/WNUSP_CRPD_Manual.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

WNUSP joined with other organizations to create the International Disability Caucus, which jointly represented organizations of people with disabilities and allies during the CRPD negotiations.  WNUSP was part of the steering committee of the IDC, which maintained a principle of respecting the leadership of diverse constituencies on issues affecting them, and also maintained that the convention should be of equal value to all persons with disabilities irrespective of the type of disability or geographical location.  Tina Minkowitz, WNUSP's representative on the IDC steering committee, coordinated the IDC's work on key articles of the CRPD, including those on legal capacity, liberty, torture and ill-treatment and integrity of the person. Since the adoption and entry into force of the CRPD, WNUSP has worked with other organizations in the International Disability Alliance and its CRPD Forum to guide the interpretation and application of the CRPD on these issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://wnusp.rafus.dk/crpd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 at a Conference held in Dresden on "Coercive Treatment in Psychiatry: A Comprehensive Review", the president and other leaders of the [[World Psychiatric Association]] met, following a formal request from the World Health Organization, with four representatives from the user/survivor movement, including Judi Chamberlin, co-chair of WNUSP, who participated in her personal capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Mezzichi, J.E. (2007) [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2174591 The dialogal basis of our profession: Psychiatry with the Person World Psychiatry.] 2007 October; 6(3): 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Salam Gomez and Jolijn Santegoeds are the current Co-Chairpersons of WNUSP.

Current International Representative and former co-chair of WNUSP is Tina Minkowitz, an international advocate and lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=163&lt;/ref&gt; She represented WNUSP in the Working Group convened by the UN to produce a draft text of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/rights/ahcwg.htm#membership&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to a UN seminar on torture and persons with disabilities&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/disability/seminartorturereportfinal.doc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/disability/docs/torture/AnnexIII.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; that resulted in an important report on the issue by Special Rapporteur on Torture Manfred Nowak in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/disability/docs/A.63.175_en.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Since the 1970s, the  psychiatric survivors movement has grown from a few scattered self-help groups to a worldwide network engaged in protecting [[civil rights]] and facilitation of efforts to provide [[House|housing]], [[employment]], public [[education]], [[research]], socialisation and [[advocacy]] programmes.  The term 'psychiatric survivor' is used by individuals who identify themselves as having experienced human rights violations in the mental health system.  WNUSP was established to further promote this movement and to respond on an international level to the oppression survivors continue to experience.

After initially meeting, in 1991, as the World Federation of Psychiatric Users at the biennial [[World Federation for Mental Health]] conference in [[Mexico]], the network's name was changed to WNUSP in 1997.  In 2000, the WNUSP Secretariat was established in [[Odense]], [[Denmark]].  In 2001, the network held its First General Assembly in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], with 34 groups from twelve countries represented, and adopted its governing statutes.

In 2004, the network held its Second General Assembly in [[Vejle, Denmark]] with 150 participants from 50 countries attending.

In 2007 WNUSP received [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|ECOSOC]] special consultative status at the United Nations.

In 2009, WNUSP held its third General Assembly in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]].  It adopted the Kampala Declaration stating its positions on the CRPD, which was later expanded into a longer version adopted by consensus of the board and the participants in the Kampala GA.&lt;ref&gt;http://wnusp.rafus.dk/general-assemblies/&lt;/ref&gt;

==ENUSP==
The European Network of (Ex)Users and Survivors of Psychiatry is the most important European [[NGO]] of (ex-)users and survivors. Forty-two representatives from 16 European countries met at a conference to found it in the Netherlands in October 1991. Every 2 years, delegates from the ENUSP members in more than 40 European countries meet at a conference where the policies for the coming period are set out. All delegates are (ex-)users and survivors of psychiatry. ENUSP is officially involved in consultations on mental health plans and policies of the [[European Union]], [[World Health Organization]] and other important bodies. Initial funding came from the Dutch government and from the European Commission but has since proved more difficult to secure. ENUSP is involved in commenting and debating declarations, position papers, policy guidelines of the EU, UN, WHO and other important bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Hollis, I. (2002) [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119016304/abstract About the impossibility of a single (ex-)user and survivor of psychiatry position] Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica Volume 104 Issue s410, Pages 102 - 106&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2455">'''Young Europe''' ({{lang-it|Giovine Europa}}) was an international association formed in 1834 by [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] on the model of  [[Young Italy]]. It was composed of the national societies of [[Young Italy]], {{ill|Young Poland (organization)|lt=Young Poland|pl|Młoda Polska (organizacja)}}, and [[Young Germany]], which, independent in their own sphere, acted in common, through a central committee, for the furthering of the principles of [[liberty]], [[egalitarianism|equality]], and [[humanity (virtue)|humanity]] in [[Europe]]. The headquarters of the society were in [[Switzerland]], where, in 1835-36, was brought about the organization of a French society, [[Young France]]. The activity of the society speedily aroused the opposition of the Swiss authorities, who expelled many of its members from the country.

:"In the Spring of 1834, while at Berne, Mazzini and a dozen refugees from Italy, Poland and Germany founded a new association with the grandiose name of Young Europe. Its basic, and equally grandiose idea, was that, as the French Revolution of 1789 had enlarged the concept of individual liberty, another revolution would now be needed for national liberty; and his vision went further because he hoped that in the no doubt distant future free nations might combine to form a loosely federal Europe with some kind of federal assembly to regulate their common interests. [...] His intention was nothing less than to overturn the European settlement agreed in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna, which had reestablished an oppressive hegemony of a few great powers and blocked the emergence of smaller nations. [...] Mazzini hoped, but without much confidence, that his vision of a league or society of independent nations would be realized in his own lifetime. In practice Young Europe lacked the money and popular support for more than a short-term existence. Nevertheless he always remained faithful to the ideal of a united continent for which the creation of individual nations would be an indispensable preliminary." [Denis Mack Smith, "Mazzini," Yale University Press (1994) pp. 11-12] https://www.amazon.com/Mazzini-Denis-Mack-Smith/dp/0300068840/
