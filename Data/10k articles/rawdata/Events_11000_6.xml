The '''1991 protests in Belgrade''' happened on the streets of [[Belgrade]], the capital of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] when a protest rally turned into a riot featuring vicious clashes between the protesters and police.

The initial mass rally that took place on March 9, 1991 was organized by [[Vuk Drašković]]'s [[Serbian Renewal Movement]] (SPO), an opposition political party in Serbia, protesting the rule of [[Slobodan Milošević]] and his [[Socialist Party of Serbia]], particularly their misuse of [[Radio Television Belgrade]]. Two people died in the ensuing violence, and the government then ordered the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] onto the city streets. The police detained several prominent SPO officials and banned two media outlets considered unfriendly to the government. The protests are referred to in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] as ''{{lang|sr|Devetomartovski protest}}'', i.e. the '''March 9 protest''', after this initial event.

The next day, in reaction to the events of the previous day, more protests drew large and diverse crowds, including leaders of the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] (DS), with some referring to it as a "Velvet Revolution". The next day still, the government supporters responded by organizing a counter-rally of their own. The protests ended on March 14 as the leaders of SPO were released from police custody. The government replaced the director of the state TV as well as the Minister of the Interior.

==Background==
Beset by a multitude of political and economic issues, [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] still existed in March 1991, with [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]] as its biggest and most populous constituent part. [[Multi-party system|Multi-party political system]] had been introduced less than a year earlier, in 1990, meaning that instead of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist League]]'s (SKJ) [[League of Communists of Serbia|Serbian branch]] (SKS) that exclusively ruled for 45 years, Serbia's political landscape was once again, for the first time since the early 1940s, dotted with many parties.

However, only three parties could boast any kind of actual significance: [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] (SPS), Drašković's [[Serbian Renewal Movement]] (SPO), and [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] (DS) led at the time by [[Dragoljub Mićunović]] and featuring high-ranking members [[Zoran Đinđić]] and [[Vojislav Koštunica]] who would both later rise to greater prominence.

In addition to political turbulence in each of the country's six constituent republics, the security situation in SFR Yugoslavia was deteriorating as well. Incidents were especially frequent in the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]] where the two constituent ethnic groups — [[Croats]] and [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]] — began clashing following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|May 1990 election]] victory of the right-wing nationalist [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) that pursued secessionism from the Yugoslav federation, a policy which the Serbs protested and actively obstructed by engaging in a series of actions collectively termed the [[Log Revolution]]. By spring 1991, the situation in SR Croatia got extremely tense, and just days before the March 9 protest in Belgrade, the [[Pakrac clash|incident in Pakrac]] occurred.

Meanwhile, in SR Serbia, Milošević firmly controlled all the pillars of power: he himself was the [[President of Serbia|President of the Republic]]; his party [[Socialist Party of Serbia|SPS]], thanks to its huge parliamentary majority (194 seats out of 250), easily formed a stable government headed by prime minister [[Dragutin Zelenović]] (former communist [[apparatchik]], at that moment extremely loyal to Milošević). Additionally, through party-installed people like the [[Radio Television Belgrade]] general-director [[Dušan Mitević]], Milošević had a tight grip on the most important and influential media outlets, often using them for his own ends, although still not as blatantly and brazenly as he would later throughout the 1990s once the [[Yugoslav wars|wars]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|UN sanctions]] set in.

On the other hand, opposition led most prominently by [[Serbian Renewal Movement|SPO]] (19 parliamentary seats out of 250) and to a lesser extent [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|DS]] (7 seats) was often plagued by internal squabbles, ego clashes, and low-level skullduggery.

Though Drašković and SPO had already been engaged in the, often dirty and personal, political battle with [[Slobodan Milošević]], his wife [[Mira Marković]], and their allies within the Serbian administration, this antagonism particularly intensified following the joint [[Serbian general election, 1990|parliamentary and presidential elections of December 9, 1990]] where Milošević and [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] (SPS) scored an overwhelming victory, but Drašković also had a notable showing with over 800,000 votes in the presidential race that made him the most significant opposition figure. Since their access to state-controlled media, either print or electronic, was fairly limited, Drašković and his party frequently criticized and ridiculed Serbian leadership through the SPO-published weekly magazine ''Srpska reč'', edited by his wife Danica. One of the issues in February 1991 depicted Mira Marković with a [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]-like moustache and a headline "Šta hoće generali" (What Do Generals Want).

The administration's answer was an anti-SPO commentary read by TV Belgrade's journalist Slavko Budihna during central daily newscast ''Dnevnik 2'' on February 16, 1991. Among other things Budihna read: 
{{quote|...nearly all of appearances by SPO members in the media, including the letter to [[Franjo Tuđman]], published in [[Vjesnik]] this week, have finally revealed in full sight what was clear long ago - that the Serbian political right is fully prepared to co-operate with pro-[[Ustashe]] and profascist Croatia, or any other extreme right movement for that matter, despite it being against the vital historical interests of the Serbian people.... The Serbian citizens' interests are of no concern to the SPO members, their only aim is to use the dissatisfaction as well as the difficult position Serbian and Yugoslav economies find themselves in to create chaos in Serbia. Such a scenario, rehearsed and performed from Chile to Romania, is well-known and easily recognized, but in Serbia it won't and it mustn't play out.&lt;ref name="rts.rs"&gt;[http://www.rts.rs/page/tv/ci/story/17/%D0%A0%D0%A2%D0%A1+1/851986/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%9A%D0%B5.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following day, February 17, the commentary got published in its entirety in that day's issue of ''[[Politika ekspres]]'' daily. Drašković's response to this blatant misuse of the media was to demand an immediate retraction, but several days later on February 19 TV Belgrade management, specifically its news division chief Predrag Vitas, turned him down explaining that "retractions are issued only in the cases of dissemination of inaccurate information, but not for commentaries".{{sfn|Antonić|2002|p=112}}&lt;ref name="9. mart – dve decenije"/&gt; Determined not to let this go, the following day, February 20, Drašković issued a call to the streets for March 9 where the protesters would publicly demand the retraction of the original defamatory piece. From then on Drašković often referred to TV Belgrade in derisive terms as "TV [[Bastille]]":
{{quote|To SPO members and sympathizers. Dear friends! TV Belgrade continues to spread lies about us. In the commentary broadcast during TV Belgrade's Dnevnik 2 on February 16 they said we co-operate with pro-Ustashe Croatia and that we're creating chaos in Serbia. They won't issue a retraction. They're convinced they can get away with anything. Those journalists on their staff with conscience and professional integrity are being persecuted and fired. The municipal elections are coming up. They're obviously intent on repeating the propaganda crime that, along with election theft, led the communists to election victory in December. We mustn't let them get away with it this time. We must liberate TV Bastille. Let's gather on Saturday, March 9, at high noon, at our old spot on the Republic Square in front of Prince Mihailo. From there we'll go towards the TV Belgrade building. The fortress of lies must fall. No force should scare us, nor stop us. Almost all of the TV Belgrade employees are with us. The entire democratic Serbia is with us. All free television stations and all of the free journalists of the world are also with us. With bravery and strength on March 9 at noon in front of Prince Mihailo.&lt;ref name="rts.rs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istinomer.rs/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/a210.jpg SPO proglas];March 20, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Still, while the immediate cause for demonstration was ostensibly specific and narrow, this protest also had a wider ideological aspect. From its very name ''Protest against [[red star]]'' over to numerous examples of royalist insignia among the crowds, Drašković was very much whipping up old [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] - [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] issues that were at the time beginning to be talked about again publicly after almost 50 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

When SPO called the protest for March 9, DS was on the fence. Their relationship with SPO at the time was somewhat on the cool side because two of DS prominent figures, [[Kosta Čavoški]] (one of the 13 founders) and [[Nikola Milošević (politician)|Nikola Milošević]] (high-ranking member), recently left the party to form [[Serbian Liberal Party|their own]] and were now openly co-operating with SPO. On top of that, ideologically speaking, the two parties had very little in common other than their general anti-Milošević stance. And this protest initially was not clearly anti-Milošević as much as it was brought on by the feud SPO had with state TV.

In the end, no DS members were on the list of speakers but many individually still decided to show up at the protest.

The motives for the protest varied. It has been variously described as an anti-war protest,&lt;ref name="Ramet-2006"/&gt; or as a protest against the confrontational policies of the SPS,&lt;ref name="Bethlehem-Weller-1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Europa-2001"/&gt; particularly against their complete exclusion of the opposition from state politics.&lt;ref name="Meier-1999"/&gt;

==Protest==

===Lead-up to the March 9 rally===
In the days following Drašković's call to the streets, SPO reiterated its demand for the retraction of the controversial newscast commentary, but also formulated an official list of demands. They wanted the Serbian National Assembly, as an institution that founded TV Belgrade, to "prohibit SPS and SK-PzJ from creating and conducting the television network's editorial and staff hiring policies". They also wanted TV Belgrade's two channels to be "non-partisan and accessible to all political parties in proportion to their size and voter strength". Furthermore, they demanded resignations from the key TV Belgrade personnel — director [[Dušan Mitević]], as well as four other editors and on-air personalities: Slavko Budihna, Predrag Vitas (head of the news division), Ivan Krivec, and Sergej Šestakov. And finally, they demanded "cessation of the practice of obstructing the work of [[RTV Studio B|Studio B]] and [[Yutel]]".&lt;ref name="9. mart – dve decenije"&gt;[http://www.istinomer.rs/bonus/9-mart-dve-decenije-1-deo/ 9. mart – dve decenije] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201234643/http://www.istinomer.rs/bonus/9-mart-dve-decenije-1-deo/ |date=February 1, 2014 }};Istinomer.rs, Siniša Dedeić, March 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other opposition parties, including the Democratic Party (DS), [[People's Peasant Party]] (NSS), People's Radical Party (NRS), [[New Democracy (Serbia)|New Democracy]] (ND), Democratic Forum, and Liberal Party, joined and supported the set of demands.

In the days leading up to the protest Milošević seemed intent not to let it take place.

On Thursday, March 7, the city of Belgrade police branch issued a special junction banning the protest while citing "the location and the time of day when the rally is scheduled as disruptive to the public order and unobstructed flow of traffic".{{sfn|Antonić|2002|p=112}} As an alternative, they suggested the wide open space at [[Ušće (Belgrade)|Ušće]] as location for the protest, but SPO immediately refused to move the protest location.&lt;ref name="9. mart – dve decenije"/&gt;

Seeing that the gathering at the Republic Square would not be allowed by the police thus realizing the potential for street clashes, Drašković appeared interested in some kind of a last minute mediation attempt or indirect deal by having his SPO MPs call for an immediate parliamentary meeting. However, they were flatly rejected by the SPS majority.{{sfn|Antonić|2002|p=113}} Finally, on March 8, just one day before the scheduled protest, SPO MPs demanded a personal meeting with Milošević in his cabinet, but this time Milošević didn't even dignify their request with a response.{{sfn|Antonić|2002|p=113}}

Milošević's administration appeared confident, even arrogant, about possessing enough means and support to stop the protest from taking place.{{sfn|Antonić|2002|p=113}}

===March 9===
[[File:18a - 1991.jpg|right|thumb|Renowned Serbian writer [[Borislav Pekić]] was one of many well-known Serbs at the protest]]
March 9, 1991 was a pleasant, partly sunny, slightly windy Saturday in late winter. The protest was scheduled to take place at the [[Republic Square (Belgrade)|Republic Square]] in [[Belgrade]], a wide open area right in the city's downtown core. In the early morning, the square was already filled with a substantial crowd. The police presence was also heavy. Just after 10 a.m. the police (consisting of members from all over Serbia as well as the police reserve members) established control over most streets in the city centre and blocked major roads heading into Belgrade.

This led to numerous incidents throughout different parts of the city centre before the protest rally even started as the police tried, often brutally, to impede the stream of people heading to the square. Soon after, the battles started at the square itself as the police started using armoured vehicles, water cannons, and tear gas in an attempt to drive the protesters out of the square. Enraged protesters immediately began responding, some of them armed with sticks, traffic sign poles, crow bars or whatever else they could get their hands on. The crowd from the adjoining streets jeered the police, chanting angrily at them to "go to [[Pakrac]]" or to "go to Kosovo".&lt;ref name="9. mart – dve decenije"/&gt; Some of the others from the crowd that managed to get into the square made allusions to the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] chanting "alea alea [[Securitate]]a" while calling Milošević a fascist.&lt;ref name="9. mart – dve decenije"/&gt;

While battles and skirmishes were already taking place for more than an hour, mass bedlam started around 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. when a large crowd of protesters held in check up to that point near the [[Ruski car Tavern|Ruski car restaurant]] managed to break through the police cordon. Yelling "Ustaše, Ustaše" at the police, the protesters started moving further into the square near the monument while the police tried unsuccessfully to stop them with a water cannon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://istinomer.rs/bonus/beograd-ratiste-2-deo/ Beograd – ratište] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220185757/http://www.istinomer.rs/bonus/beograd-ratiste-2-deo/ |date=February 20, 2014 }};Istinomer.rs, Siniša Dedeić, March 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously, the scheduled speakers, including Drašković, had trouble making it into the square. Along with his entourage consisting of some 200 SPO members, at little after 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. Drašković was being held at the intersection of November 29 Street and [[George Washington|Vašingtonova]] Street, surrounded by the police cordon that didn't want to let them join the protesters at the Republic Square. He tried to reason with them, appealing with their chiefs to let him into the square "in order to calm the crowd and prevent bloodshed".&lt;ref name="9. mart – dve decenije"/&gt; Some 15 minutes later, the police let them through without much resistance.

Getting into the square, the impressive crowd size probably surprised even Drašković himself as the entire area was literally flooded with people. Flanked by the individuals loyal to him (including several prominent members of the Belgrade underworld such as [[Đorđe Božović|Đorđe "Giška" Božović]] and Aleksandar "Knele" Knežević who essentially acted as his bodyguards), Drašković climbed the [[Prince Mihailo Monument]] and attempted to address the large crowd using a [[megaphone]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jqfNJhOvkM Aleksandar Knezevic Knele i Djordje Bozovic Giska Demonstracije 9 Marta 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates on the number of people in the crowd vary: under 70,000,&lt;ref name="Ramet-2006"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FTw3lEqi2-oC&amp;pg=PA384 | accessdate = 2013-03-09 | title = The Three Yugoslavias: State-Building And Legitimation, 1918-2005 | author = Sabrina P. Ramet | publisher = Indiana University Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780253346568 | page = 384}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 100,000,&lt;ref name="Bethlehem-Weller-1997"/&gt; or in excess of 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=2&amp;article=1027&amp;context=purduepress_ebooks&amp;type=additional | format = PDF | title = The Dissolution of Yugoslavia | first1 = Andrew | last1 = Wachtel | first2 = Christopher | last2 = Bennett | page = 37 | publisher = Purdue University Press | accessdate = 2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing very few could hear him, Drašković then decided to seek permission from nearby [[National Theatre in Belgrade|National Theater]] personnel to address the crowds from its balcony, which provided a nice view of the entire square.

Permission was granted by then-director [[Vida Ognjenović]] (incidentally a prominent [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|DS]] member), so Drašković took to the balcony and began a fiery speech often interrupted by thunderous applause:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Serbia, may God give us the dawn of freedom in our homeland as well.

I'm not going to tell you everything that has happened since this morning; we all broke through different police barriers and therein showed that no obstacle will stop us.

I salute you, heroes!

I said it a month ago - even when the bolsheviks didn't believe me - and I'll say it again right this moment: today, in front of our righteous Prince [referring to the [[Prince Mihailo Monument|statue]] of [[Mihailo Obrenović|Prince Mihailo Obrenović]] that dominates the square, and especially in few moments when we start marching on TV Bastille, we will show Serbian heart and we will show Serbian persistence.

Unfortunately, we have no other way!

Heroes, I remind you of the words of our pan-Serbian patriarch of our pan-Serbian mind, [[vladika]] [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš|Njegoš]]: ‘Svak je rođen za po jednom mreti’. They've got until 3:30 p.m. to issue a retraction and tender resignations and if they do that we'll return here to this pan-Serb gathering of national unity. Because of the brutal police charge on the unarmed people we also demand that the Minister of the Interior resign at the very next parliamentary session.

The President of the Republic'' [Slobodan Milošević] ''has to weigh between two choices in front of him: on one end of the scale are your lives as well as lives of many policemen because I heard our boys seized a lot of automatic weaponry in fights with police today - on that scale there are so many lives, Serbia's freedom, honour, and peace - while on the other end of the scale there are only 5 resignations and 1 retraction.

Let the President decide what he wants, I have made my choice: I will lead the charge on Television today, fully ready to die!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His last proclamation put the present police squadron (led by Milošević loyalist Radovan "Badža" Stojičić) in full alert mode. After Drašković finished, other people took the microphone, among them [[Milan Paroški]], Žarko Jokanović, Leon Koen, Milan Komnenić, Borislav Mihajlović Mihiz etc. [[Dragoslav Bokan]] and [[Borislav Pekić]] were present in the crowd but did not hold a speech.

Around noon, in the middle of Mihiz's speech, police moved into the square with tear gas and full blown battle began. However, overwhelmed and outnumbered by the crowd the police retreated while trying to keep the angry protesters in check with water cannons. The situation was deteriorating by the second, flower beds were being overturned and broken off into smaller pieces of concrete to be thrown onto police vehicles. Drašković did not seem fazed by scenes of violence below, and if anything was only spurring them on. At one point he even bizarrely yelled "''Juuuuuuriš''" (Chaaaaaarge) into the microphone the way a field general would at the scene of battle.

The protest then spilled into adjoining streets and squares and most of the downtown Belgrade soon resembled a war zone. By this time, the police managed to regroup and reinforce their numbers, and began responding and attacking a lot more forcefully.

Still, for about seven hours the protesters almost controlled the city as the majority of the police was guarding the TV Belgrade building and Dedinje. According to sources, some 200 policemen and 180 security guards in addition to 200 television staffers with basic military training who were given [[AK-47]]s were guarding the television building.{{sfn|Đukić|1997|p=99-100}}

In the afternoon, Drašković, along with a large group of protesters, unsuccessfully attempted to storm the National Assembly of Serbia session. As he exited the building, he was arrested along with SPO deputy president Jovan Marjanović. Among the policemen handling Drašković's arrest was [[Naser Orić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sarajevo-x.com/clanak/071020022 |title=Naser Orić u stalnom kontaktu sa sinom Slobodana Miloševića |accessdate=March 10, 2009 |work= |publisher= Sarajevo-x.com|date=October 20, 2007 |language=bs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbian President Slobodan Milošević demanded that the [[Presidency of Yugoslavia]] deploys troops of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] to suppress the protest.&lt;ref name="Europa-2001"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hVNvCz0c_gsC&amp;pg=PA2054 | accessdate = 2013-03-09 | title = Political Chronology of Europe | author = Europa Publications | publisher = Routledge | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781135356873 | page = 2054}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Borisav Jović]] contacted other members of the Presidency by phone and the Army was indeed deployed, but the Slovenians later claimed the move was made unconstitutionally.&lt;ref name="Ramet-2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meier-1999"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6DLi2dJfVLMC&amp;pg=PA165 | accessdate = 2013-03-09 | title = Yugoslavia: History of Its Demise | author = Viktor Meier | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780415185967 | page = 165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the evening, Milošević took to the public airwaves to address the nation. While not mentioning anyone by name he characterized the day's events as being orchestrated by "forces of chaos and madness threatening to restore everything that the people of Serbia rose against half a century ago".

Tanks and armored cars rolled onto the streets.&lt;ref name="Ramet-2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bethlehem-Weller-1997"/&gt;

Radio B92 and [[RTV Studio B|Studio B]] television were banned and stopped broadcasting. Additionally, 203 protesters were injured and further 108 were arrested on March 9.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

636 people were arrested following the protest.&lt;ref name="Bethlehem-Weller-1997"/&gt;

===Casualties===
The protest claimed two lives. On March 9 around 3:30pm while running away from the crowd of protesters in Masarikova Street near [[Beograđanka]], 54-year-old policeman Nedeljko Kosović died from repeated blows to the head.

Later in the day, 17-year-old protester Branivoje Milinović was killed by a stray bullet. The circumstances of his death are conflicting as some reports claim he died as the crowd was storming the SR Serbia parliament building&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972607,00.html Yugoslavia: Mass Bedlam in Belgrade, TIME, March 25, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; while others say he was killed by a rubber bullet when a group of policemen on the corner of Admirala Geprata Street and [[Kneza Miloša street]] opened fire in the direction of protesters in front of London Cafe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/179978/Devetnaest-godina-od-demonstracija-u-Beogradu Devetnaest godina od demonstracija u Beogradu]; ''Blic'', March 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/reportaze/aktuelno.293.html:423377-Godisnjica-devetomartovskog-protesta Godišnjica devetomartovskog protesta];''Večernje novosti'', March 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation into his death was recently reopened.

===March 10===
The next day, March 10, Belgrade awoke to the anti-opposition headline "Rušilački pohod" (Destructive Crusade) on the front page of ''[[Politika]]'', the most important of the four dailies being published in the city at the time. Edited by the Milošević loyalist Žika Minović, the rest of that day's issue was not much different — of the 51 total pieces about the previous day's events, 49 presented a strong condemnation of the opposition, SPO, and Drašković.{{sfn|Antonić|2002|p=115}} ''[[Večernje novosti]]'', edited by Rade Brajović, ran a fairly balanced March 10 issue, mostly covering the events neutrally and avoiding emotional outbursts in favour of either side. However, according to the paper's journalist Miroslav Turudić, at the staff meeting that very Sunday evening the editor-in-chief Brajović objected to the paper's coverage of the protests. Along with deciding to steer the coverage in the following day's issue clearly to the Milošević's side, Brajović also published a commentary in which he openly criticizes his staff's previous coverage of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhqjLZz8fII#t=1200 Mediji u Srbiji: Hronika jednog propadanja];Slaviša Lekić&lt;/ref&gt;

DS held a press conference with its president Dragoljub Mićunović as well as members Zoran Đinđić and Vojislav Koštunica on hand, voicing support to arrested Drašković and SPO while condemning government actions. Đinđić described the events of the previous day as "the police carrying out a plan, a one man's personal plan, one man who decided that this protest can not and will not happen" going on to say that "the catastrophe occurred due to the inability of those giving orders to the police to adapt to the rapidly changing situation on the ground".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBqpti4U3Rs]&lt;/ref&gt;

During late evening hours, a large crowd again began to gather, but this time in front of the [[Terazije]] fountain. The protest now assumed a more civil tone, although there were still incidents on [[Branko's Bridge]] when a group of 5,000 [[University of Belgrade]] students heading into the city centre from their residence in [[Studentski Grad (Belgrade)|Studentski Grad]] in order to join the protesters got stopped by police. Pepper spray was used and some of the students were beaten, but all of them were eventually allowed to pass through and join the crowd at Terazije (among the individuals negotiating with the police on the bridge was a Democratic Party (DS) member Zoran Đinđić).

Gatherings in front of the [[Terazije]] fountain were notably led and moderated by actor [[Branislav Lečić]] with various figures from Serbian public life such as screenwriter [[Dušan Kovačević]], actor [[Rade Šerbedžija]], and even [[Serbian Patriarch Pavle]] taking turns addressing the crowd. In his speeches, Lečić often referred to the rally as "Velvet Revolution" while holding a stuffed panda toy and drawing parallels with the [[Velvet Revolution|Czechoslovak protests of November 1989]].

The protest also expanded in terms of the political figures that joined it with DS members now officially taking part. The anti-government component was now much more prominently displayed among the crowds. The protesters, composed largely of students, demanded freedom for Drašković and Jovan Marjanović. In addition to earlier protests for the resignation of Dušan Mitević, they now wanted the Minister of Interior Radmilo Bogdanović to resign too. They also sought the lifting of the broadcast ban for Radio B92 and RTV Studio B.

===March 11===
On March 11, the Serbian government regrouped by organising a mass counter-rally at their old stomping grounds [[Ušće]]. Called under the name "For the defense of the Republic, for constitutionality, freedom, and democracy", the rally attempted to show that protesters at the Republic Square and Terazije in no way represented the wishes and desires of the majority of Serbian population. Using previously developed and tested [[astroturfing]] methods, they bussed many workers into Belgrade from other parts of Serbia for the occasion and also used its grip on state TV to inflate the crowd size. Still, a good portion of the crowd was there on its own volition, especially older individuals and many pensioners that were always Milošević's core support. Instead of Milošević addressing the gathered crowd, the speaking was left to his party's most publicly prominent members and ideologues at the time: [[Mihailo Marković]], Dušan Matković, Živorad Igić, [[Radoman Božović]], [[Petar Škundrić]], etc. The most controversial speech of the day was Matković's, at times referring to protesters as "hooligans" and inciting their own supporters to "do away with them".

===Up to March 14===
The protests persisted and after four days of mostly peaceful demonstration (there were further skirmishes with police on March 11), they achieved their aims: Drašković and Marjanović were freed and Mitević and Bogdanović were replaced.

The demonstrations ended after March 14.&lt;ref name="Bethlehem-Weller-1997"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7SczBzxA6-IC&amp;pg=PR26 | title = The 'Yugoslav' Crisis in International Law: General Issues, Volume 1 | author = D.

The '''2006 Copiapó mining accident''' occurred on January 20, 2006, when an explosion occurred in the underground Carola-Agustina copper mine in [[Copiapó]], [[Chile]] after two trucks collided, covering the only escape route for the miners inside the mine.&lt;ref name="esmas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cooperativa"&gt;{{Cite web

Shortly after the explosion occurred, workers at the nearby mine, "Punta de Cobre", began digging a tunnel towards the Carola-Agustina mine to assist in rescuing the trapped miners.&lt;ref name="esmas"/&gt;

Rescue efforts lasted seven hours, and the trapped miners were rescued alive.

The '''2007 FIA European Truck Racing Championship''' was a multi-event motor racing championship for production based trucks held across Europe. The championship features a mix of professional motor racing teams and privately funded amateur drivers competing in highly modified versions of two-axle [[tractor unit]]s which conform to the technical regulations for the championship. It was the 23rd European Truck Racing Championship season and began at [[Circuit de Catalunya|Catalunya]] on April 1, with the finale at [[Circuito del Jarama|Jarama]] on October 7 after nine events. The championship was won by [[Markus Bösiger]], taking his first title.

[[Yahoo! Voices]], formerly Associated Content, was hacked in July 2012. The hack is supposed to have leaked approximately half a million [[email]] addresses and [[password]]s associated with Yahoo! Contributor Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Horizons/2012/0712/Yahoo-hack-steals-400-000-passwords.-Is-yours-on-the-list|title=Yahoo hack steals 400,000 passwords. Is yours on the list?|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspected hacker group, D33ds, used a method of [[SQL Injection]] to penetrate Yahoo! Voice servers. Security experts said that the passwords were not [[encrypted]] and the website did not use a [[HTTPS|HTTPS Protocol]], which was one of the major reasons of the [[data breach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/12/technology/yahoo-hack/|title=Yahoo! Voice fails security 101 as 443,000 passwords are exposed|publisher=CNNMoney.com|accessdate=July 29, 2012|date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The email addresses and passwords are still available to download in a plaintext file on the hacker's website. The hacker group described the hack as a "wake-up call" for Yahoo! security experts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tapscape.com/yahoo-hack-find-affected/ The Yahoo! Hack: How to find if you're affected?] Publisher: Tapscape.com&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Bonneau, a security researcher and a former product analysis manager at Yahoo, said "Yahoo can fairly be criticized in this case for not integrating the Associated Content accounts more quickly into the general Yahoo login system, for which I can tell you that password protection is much stronger."&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/12/technology/yahoo-hack/|title=Yahoo! fails security 101 as 443,000 passwords are leaked|publisher=CNN Money|accessdate=July 29, 2012|date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction by communities and users==
D33DS, the suspected hacker group, said that the hack was a "wake-up call". They said that it was not a threat to Yahoo!, Inc. The IT Security firm TrustedSec.net said that the passwords contained a number of email addresses from [[Gmail]], [[AOL]], [[Yahoo]], and more such websites.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinospost.com/articles/1983/20120712/yahoo-password-hack-2012-breach-details-why.htm|title=Yahoo Password hack 2012:Breach details|publisher=LatinsPost|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response from Yahoo==
Immediately after the hack, Yahoo!, in a written statement, apologized for the breach. Yahoo! did not disclose how many passwords were valid after the hack, because they said that every minute, 1-3 passwords are changed on their site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/12/yahoo-voice-hack-gmail-aol-hotmail_n_1668886.html|title=Yahoo! Voice hack puts Gmail, AOL, Lycos into trouble|publisher=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=July 29, 2012|first=Catharine|last=Smith|date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahoo! said that only 5% of its passwords were stolen during the hack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/yahoo-hack-passwords/1/186223.html|title=Yahoo hacks leaks 4.5 lakhs of passwords|publisher=[[Business Today (business magazine)|Business Today]]|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hackers' website, &lt;code&gt;d33ds.co&lt;/code&gt;, was not available later on Thursday, after the hack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/yahoo-hacked-45-lakh-passwords-reportedly-posted-online/270871-11.html|title=Yahoo! Voice hacked: 4.5 lakh passwords in the net|publisher=IBNLive.com|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahoo! said in a written statement that it takes security very seriously and is working together to fix the vulnerability in its site. Yahoo! said that it was in the process of changing the passwords of the hacked accounts and notifying other companies of the hack.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.webpronews.com/yahoo-voices-is-latest-to-be-hacked-with-450000-accounts-stolen-2012-07|title=Yahoo Voices is latest to be hacked with 450,000 accounts stolen|publisher=Webpronews.com|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
A simple matter had sparked a controversy over Yahoo!. The controversy was sparked because of Yahoo!'s silence about the data breach. After the servers were hacked, Yahoo! did not mail the affected victims, although it was promised earlier. There was no site-wide notifications about the hack, nor did any victim get any type of personal messages detailing how to reset their account passwords from Yahoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.niuzer.com/Philadelphia-PA/Yahoo-fails-to-notify-453k-users-of-massive-email-security-breach-12836310.html|title=Yahoo! fails to notify 453k+ of affected victims|publisher=Niuzer.com|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In Round Three, the winner of the race will be declared the race winner and will collect 40 points.  The runner-up will receive 20 points.  Third and fourth place drivers will be credited as semifinal losers.
&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; Races at Pacific Raceway abandoned after semifinals because of rain.  There were two Top Fuel and Funny Car finals at Brainerd, and two Pro Stock finals at the U. S. Nationals.  The first winner listed is the Saturday race, while the second winner is the Sunday (Brainerd) or Monday (U. S. Nationals) race.
*&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Finals televised on tape delay. Otherwise, finals will be televised live.  Note at Norwalk, the first two rounds were televised live on Fox Sports 1, and the remainder aired on tape delay on Fox Sports 2 after the NASCAR race, as Fox Sports 1 had coverage of the [[2016 Copa America]] final.  The first Brainerd Top Fuel and Funny Car, and the first Lucas Oil Raceway Pro Stock (car) final aired on tape delay (FS1).  The Pro Stock (car and motorcycle) and the second Top Fuel and Funny Car finals at Brainerd aired live.  At the U. S. Nationals, the Top Fuel, Funny Car, Pro Stock Motorcycle finals and the second Pro Stock (car) finals will air on Fox live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nhra.com/nhraontv/melloyello.aspx | title= FOX NHRA TV schedule | date = | accessdate = January 10, 2016 | work = NHRA.com | publisher = [[National Hot Rod Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable events==
*  NHRA and ESPN mutually agreed to end their television coverage agreement following the 2015 season. The 2016 season was to be the final year of a five-year rights extension deal that took effect in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nhra.com/story/2015/7/14/nhra-espn-2015/ | title = NHRA and ESPN announce television changes | date = July 14, 2015 | accessdate = November 15, 2015|work=NHRA.com|publisher=[[National Hot Rod Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* NHRA and Fox Sports jointly announced that starting in 2016 the NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series will be televised by [[Fox Sports 1]] (FS1). The channel will provide coverage of Friday and Saturday qualifying and Sunday eliminations for each NHRA Mello Yello Series event, with a minimum of 16 Sunday eliminations shows to be presented in a live coverage format.  The Western Swing and the U. S. Nationals will be broadcast live on the Fox broadcast network, whose broadcasts will be labeled as ''Fox NHRA''.

* NHRA and Fox Sports jointly announced the TV schedule for 2016, although with the addition of the Topeka race in December (the NHRA was legally unable to announce the Topeka race until new ownership group was confirmed), the television schedule for the Kansas round, which does not have a NASCAR conflict, it is expected to be live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nhra.com/story/2015/11/17/2016-tv-schedule/ | title = NHRA on FOX television schedule headlined by 17 live Sunday finals shows; four on Fox broadcast network | date = November 17, 2015 | accessdate = November 18, 2015|work=NHRA.com|publisher=[[National Hot Rod Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The NHRA will cease offering points for setting a national record elapsed time, and will no longer require a run to be backed up within one percent in order to set the record, as points are not offered for such records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://nhra.com/story/2016/1/25/back-up-run-certification-no-longer-required/ |title=Back-up Run Certifications No Longer Required | date = January 25, 2016 | accessdate = January 25, 2016 |work=NHRA.com |publisher=[[National Hot Rod Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu Huzaifa al-Kanadi''', also known as ''Abu Huzaifa the Canadian'', is a self-described member of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] terrorist group, which he joined in 2014 after emptying his bank account and visiting Syria. His real name is unknown but he agreed to speak to Canada's [[CBC News]] on condition that it would not be revealed.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt; Huzaifa has been counselled by [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] agent [[Mubin Shaikh]]. He returned to Canada in 2016; rumours that he lives in the [[Toronto]] area have circulated. In 2018, he said in a podcast on ''[[The New York Times]]'' website that he murdered two people while fighting for ISIS and has been criticized by conservatives, some of whom have called for him to be found and arrested.

==Background==
[[File:Turkey-syria.svg|thumb|right|Upon arrival to Syria, Huzaifa visited [[Jarabulus]] at night.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt;]]

Abu Huzaifa al-Kanadi was raised in or near [[Toronto]], Canada, and went to Pakistan as a teenager to study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Malcolm|first1=Candice|title=Malcolm: Canadian jihadists are bolder than ever, meanwhile Trudeau weakens our laws|url=http://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/malcolm-canadian-jihadists-are-bolder-than-ever-meanwhile-trudeau-weakens-our-laws|newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed he studied at a Pakistani [[Madrassas in Pakistan|madrassa]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Baksh |first1=Nazim|last2=Lancester|first2=John|title=Young Canadian ISIS recruit says he saw violence on scale he could never have imagined|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/isis-canadian-recruit-returns-1.4281860|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told his parents he would go to Turkey for a semester abroad and booked a flight from [[Lahore]] to [[Istanbul]] using his Pakistani passport.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt; Upon arrival, he was met by a former resident of [[Mississauga]]—a city in the Greater Toronto Area—and visited the Syria–Turkey border town of [[Jarabulus]] to cross into Syria at night.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt; Prior to leaving [[Toronto]] in 2014, he cleaned out his bank account.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt; He returned to Canada in 2016 and is currently attending a university in the Toronto area.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt;

==Islamic State member==
In 2014, Huzaifa left Canada to join the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] group; he entered [[Manbij]], a city located north-east of [[Aleppo]] that had a population of about 100,000 people.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt; He stated that he trained for a few weeks and was assigned to [[Islamic religious police#Syrian Revels|al-Hisba]], an Islamic police force enforcing [[Sharia]] law.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt; He used several hundred dollars to purchase a rifle, a [[Glock]] pistol, an ISIS military uniform, and other tactical gear decorated with ISIS badges.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt; He said he made friends with other [[Foreign fighters in the Syrian and Iraqi Civil Wars|foreign fighters]] from Australia and Finland.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt; He met Mohammad Ali of Mississauga, also known as Abu Turaab al-Kanadi, who was the only Canadian he met.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt; He also stated that he knew about André Poulin, a Muslim convert from [[Timmins]], Ontario, who was known as Abu Muslim al-Kanadi.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt;

In a podcast on ''[[The New York Times]]'' website, Huzaifa said he had murdered people while fighting for the Islamic State.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Buller|first1=Alice|title=New York Times podcast 'Caliphate' faces backlash over ethics|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/1315651/media|newspaper=[[Arab News]]|date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said he took part in a community killing and stabbed a drug dealer multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Taghva|first1=Ali|title=A Self Confessed ISIS Killer Walks Free – Because It's 2018 |url=https://www.thepostmillennial.com/a-self-confessed-isis-killer-walks-free-because-its-2018/|publisher=The Post Millennial|date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped to Turkey, where he was arrested by authorities before being released a week later.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt; After his release, he returned to Pakistan and stayed for two years before returning to Canada.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt;

==Return to Canada==
[[File:Mubin Shaikh - 2015 (21701239792) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Huzaifa was counseled by [[Mubin Shaikh]].]]

Huzaifa returned to Canada in 2016 after two years of fighting for the Islamic State.&lt;ref name=TheGlobeAndMail /&gt; Upon his return, he had discussions with journalist [[Rukmini Callimachi]]; she stated that he initially felt confident that he had escaped law enforcement.&lt;ref name=TheGlobeAndMail /&gt; Former schoolmates stated that Huzaifa was a "loner" and an "anti-social guy" without "many friends".&lt;ref name=TheGlobeAndMail /&gt; Huzaifa's background story was compared to those of [[Quebec City mosque shooting|Quebec Mosque]] shooter Alexandre Bissonnette and [[Toronto van attack]] suspect Alek Minassian.&lt;ref name=TheGlobeAndMail&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Balkissoon|first1=Denise|title=Canada's mysterious Islamic State returnee looks frighteningly familiar|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-canadas-mysterious-islamic-state-returnee-looks-frighteningly/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year after Huzaifa returned, he was interviewed by [[CBC News]] and stated that he saw violence on a scale he could "never imagine" when he fought for the Islamic State.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt; [[Mubin Shaikh]] stated that Huzaifi could be "rehabilitated" and that Canada needs to "have an eye" on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=MacDonald|first1=Brennan|last2=Kapelos |first2=Vassy|title=Canada needs to 'have eyes' on returned ISIS fighter, says de-radicalization expert|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-shaikh-abu-huzaifa-1.4677258|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
After Huzaifa said he fought for the Islamic State, Conservative MPs called for action against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Conservative MPs call for action on self-described terror recruit for Daesh reportedly in Toronto|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/05/11/conservative-mps-call-for-action-on-self-described-terror-recruit-for-daesh-reportedly-in-toronto.html |publisher=[[The Canadian Press]]|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative politician [[Candice Bergen (politician)|Candice Bergen]] criticized Canada's Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] and the Liberal government during [[Question Period]] for not ordering law enforcement to arrest him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Fernando |first1=Spencer |title=Watch: Bergen Rips Trudeau Government For Letting Confessed-ISIS Terrorist Come Back To Canada |url=https://www.spencerfernando.com/2018/05/12/watch-bergen-rips-trudeau-government-for-letting-confessed-isis-terrorist-come-back-to-canada/|publisher=Spencer Fernando|date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergen also called for Public Safety Minister [[Ralph Goodale]] to reveal whether the government knew where Huzaifa was, but Goodale stated that doing so would be the "opposite of keeping Canadians safe".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Khandaker |first1=Tamara|title=Politicians are freaking out over a podcast about returned Canadian ISIS fighter |url=https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/qvn49w/politicians-are-freaking-out-over-a-podcast-about-returned-canadian-isis-fighter|publisher=[[Vice News]]|date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trudeau called questions about Huzaifa "divisive" and received criticism from conservative journalist [[Brian Lilley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Lilley|first1=Brian|title=Trudeau worries that questions about a violent ISIS fighter are divisive |url=http://brianlilley.com/trudeau-worries-that-questions-about-a-violent-isis-fighter-are-divisive/|publisher=[[Brian Lilley]]|date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huzaifa also received concerns from television journalist [[Diana Swain]] that he may be "lying" to ''The New York Times'' or CBC News.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Swain|first1=Diana|title=Did former Canadian ISIS member lie to the New York Times or to CBC News?|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/isis-abu-huzaifa-investigators-1.4669769|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, he fabricated the interviews in his own home. He sold his fabricated interviews to several Scandinavian newspapers.

Suspicion he had fabricated an interview with Margaret Thatcher arose in 1992, with Thatcher denying that the alleged interview had taken place. In the summer of 2006, it was revealed that Benkow had fabricated several additional interviews. After spokespersons for several of the celebrities had denied that such interviews took place, Benkow admitted to having fabricated the interviews.

His uncle was the politician [[Jo Benkow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/magasinet/2007/05/07/499914.html Juksemaker'n - portrettet - Dagbladet.no&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boilerplate''' is a fictional [[robot]] which would have existed in the [[Victorian era]] and early 20th century. It was created in 2000 by [[Portland, Oregon]] USA artist Paul Guinan.&lt;ref name="PW"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended for comics, the character became known via a faux-historical website created by Guinan, and has since appeared in other media.

== Development ==
Boilerplate was originally featured on a website created by Paul Guinan in 2000. The Boilerplate site details the history of a remarkable robot built in the late 19th century, and features photoshopped "archival images" in which Boilerplate (actually a 12-inch articulated model) is seen interacting with historical figures, such as [[Teddy Roosevelt]] and [[Pancho Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  |work=csmonitor.com
  |publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=2009-01-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Becoming aware that some visitors to the site were taken in by its contents, making it an unintentional hoax, Guinan resolved to see how authentic he could make the character seem, working to ensure the descriptions of non-fictional events were accurate. He explained his motivation in a 2002 interview

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Certainly I felt happy about having achieved my goal," he said. "I put this thing across as trying to be real, and people bought into it. So, that's a success! But, as an amateur historian, I feel a responsibility to get the story right. So I felt bad about some of these people being hoaxed. It was a mixed bag."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Paul Guinan &amp; Anina Bennett at WonderCon 2010 1.JPG|thumb|upright|Guinan and Bennett at [[WonderCon]] 2010]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;"But," he revealed, "I thought, if I was getting this reaction and I wasn't really trying, then what would happen if I really tried?"&lt;ref name="PMerc" &gt;{{cite news
  |url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/Content?oid=27888&amp;category=34029

  |publisher=Index Newspapers|accessdate=2009-01-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Guinan estimated that roughly a third of the site's visitors treated its faux history as real. Comedian [[Chris Elliott]], while realising that Boilerplate was fictional, thought that the spoof dated back to the 19th century and included the character in one of his books (see [[Boilerplate (robot)#In other media|below]]).&lt;ref name="NYT" &gt;{{cite news

  |accessdate=2009-01-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guinan later expanded his website into ''The History of Robots in the Victorian Era'', which features other "turn-of-the-century robots, both real and imagined".

== Fictional character history ==
Boilerplate is built by Professor Archibald Campion in the 1880s and unveiled at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name="BRH1"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.bigredhair.com/boilerplate/
 |title=Boilerplate: History of a Victorian Era Robot
 |last=Guinan |first=Paul
 |work=Big Red Hair
 |accessdate=2009-01-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The robot's notable adventures include an expedition to the [[Antarctic]], during which it saves the lives of the team members by singlehandedly moving ice floes, clearing a path for the ship to sail out.&lt;ref name="BRH2"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.bigredhair.com/boilerplate/arctic/index.html
 |title=Boilerplate in Antarctica
 |last=Guinan |first=Paul
 |work=Big Red Hair
 |accessdate=2009-01-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed for the self-proclaimed purpose of "preventing the deaths of men in the conflicts of nations," Boilerplate charges into combat during the [[Spanish–American War]] and the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. Campion and his robot also circle the planet with the U.S. Navy, make silent movies, and hobnob with the likes of [[Mark Twain]] and [[Nikola Tesla]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0810989506&lt;/ref&gt;

Boilerplate is also active in the [[First World War]], but disappears during the relief of Major Whittlesey's [[Lost Battalion (World War I)|Lost Battalion]], possibly having been captured by the Germans for study. Supporters of this theory point out that German military technology advances tremendously in the twenty years between the two world wars, encompassing guided rockets, experimental jets, and sophisticated tanks.&lt;ref name="BRH3"&gt;

* Paul Guinan and his wife [[Anina Bennett]] (who also maintains the Boilerplate website) have [[coauthor]]ed ''Boilerplate: History's Mechanical Marvel'', an illustrated history of the character's adventures.  This [[coffee table book]] covers Boilerplate's 25-year existence as well as its subsequent impact on popular culture.   It was published by Abrams Image in October 2009.&lt;ref name="PortTrib"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/features/story.php?story_id=123257982376068500|title=Victorian robot is a history emcee|last=Barton|first=Randall|date=Jan 22, 2009|work=The Portland Tribune|publisher=Pamplin Media Group|accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinan and Bennett have previously collaborated on the comic book ''[[Heartbreakers (comics)|Heartbreakers]]'', published by [[IDW Publishing]]; "Heartbreakers Meet Boilerplate", a 2005 [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] of this series, also featured Boilerplate&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; and was nominated for an [[Eisner Award#Best Painter/Multimedia Artist (Interior)|Eisner Award]].&lt;ref name="CCI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_eisners06nom.shtml|title=Chris Ware, Warren Ellis Garner Most Nominations for 2006 Eisners|year=2006|work=Comic-Con International|accessdate=2009-01-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uEgVZGNl?url=http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_eisners06nom.shtml|archivedate=2010-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Boilerplate is a character in [[Chris Elliott]]'s 2005 novel ''[[The Shroud of the Thwacker]]'', a spoof historical thriller.  Elliott mistakenly thought that the Boilerplate site concerned a hoax which dated back to the 19th century and included material from the website in his book, not realising it wasn't in the public domain. After being alerted to the copyright infringement, Elliott and Guinan negotiated a settlement which allowed the character to be used in exchange for a percentage of Elliott's earnings from the book and credit in future editions.&lt;ref name="PW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

'''Boston Fashion Week''' is a week-long [[luxury goods|luxury]] clothing event that takes place annually in [[Boston]], United States. [[Fashion Week]] allows for [[international]] and local [[designers]] to showcase their creations to the general public, buyers, celebrities, and [[fashion]] experts.  The event was established in the city by Jay Calderin in 1995. It faced a few setbacks in the early years, but is now increasing its popularity and importance, as [[Boston]] becomes a more fashion forward city.&lt;ref name="zimbio"&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of Boston Fashion|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Boston,+Ma/articles/12/A+History+of+Boston+Fashion|work=Zimbio|publisher=Livingly Media, Inc.|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accessibility and diversity in programming allow the public to engage the week on many levels; experiencing a show, taking in an exhibit, participating in an educational program or joining in the festivities at a [[party]]. The week also contributes to a sense of civic pride about what the region has to offer and how it continues to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Fashion Week|url=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/boston-fashion-week-2013-opening-night-reception-tickets-8243664021|accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Boston Fashion Week was founded by Jay Calderin in 1995.&lt;br&gt; Unlike other global [[fashion]] events such as the [[New York Fashion Week]], Boston Fashion Week is a [[non-profit]] event with a low [[budget]], that focuses on showcasing mainly local designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muther|first=Christopher|title=Back in fashion|url=http://www.boston.com/yourlife/fashion/articles/2007/02/15/back_in_fashion/|work=Boston.com|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the event was put on hiatus in 2004 because Jay Calderin felt that the show didn't match the quality of the clothes and was becoming very repetitive. 
Boston Fashion Week began again in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muther|first=Christopher|title=Back in fashion|url=http://www.boston.com/yourlife/fashion/articles/2007/02/15/back_in_fashion/|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event returned more powerful and with more attention of the media. It includes [[fashion shows]] and networking events. The week also contributes to a sense of civic pride about what the region has to offer and how it continues to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of Boston Fashion|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Boston,+Ma/articles/12/A+History+of+Boston+Fashion|accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the year of 2013 the Boston Fashion Week was held between September 27 and October 25 and it was specially dedicated to Alfred Fiandaca,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Boston Fashion Week|url=http://www.bostonfashionweek.com|work=Boston Fashion Week|publisher=BOSTON FASHION WEEK, LLC.|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was a leading Bostonian fashion designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Fiandaca|url=http://www.alfredfiandaca.com/about.htm|work=Alfred Fiandaca|publisher=Fiandaca Fashion Inc.|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jay Calderin ===

Jay Calderin is the founder of the Boston Fashion Week as well as the [[Executive Director]]. He was born and raised in [[New York City]].

== General pricing ==

As the [[audience]] of Boston Fashion Week includes a wide range of different kind of people, such as [[celebrities]], journalists, designers, and the [[general public]], the pricing also shows huge variation. It varies according to the day and time of the event, the designer that is being showcased, the location, and the sitting arrangement. Tickets are available online, and there may be a difference of $100,00 USD in [[VIP]] front row tickets and general admission sitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Emerging Trends 2013 during Boston Fashion Week|url=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-emerging-trends-2013-during-boston-fashion-week-tickets-7511981539|publisher=Eventbrite|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some seats and [[runway (fashion)|runway]] shows are available through special invitation only, there also are days in which the event is freely open to the general public.&lt;ref name="zimbio" /&gt;

== New designers' showcase ==

The Tent, an event within Boston Fashion Week, was first launched in September 2011 with the purpose of improving the profile of Boston Fashion Week, as well to present the creations of local designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muther|first=Christopher|title=No more Tent at Boston Fashion Week|journal=The Boston Globe|date=September 21, 2011|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2013/08/17/more-tent-boston-fashion-week/Jo3M0aeuCdr0HBdKI4XgFN/story.html|accessdate=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows them to successfully show their talent, giving them an opportunity to sprout their [[business]]. Since the creation of Boston Fashion Week in 1995, the Tent only happened twice, in 2011 and 2012, although it was very well received by the general public.

=== The Tent 2011 ===

[[File:Sam Mendoza - Boston Fashion Week 2012.jpg|thumb|240px|Sam Mendoza - Boston Fashion Week 2012]]
The first year of The Tent presented local well-known designers such as Emily Muller, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130821211918/http://www.michaeldepaulo.com/collection/fall-winter-2011/ Michael DePaulo], [http://www.danielfauchercouture.com/index.html Daniel Faucher Couture] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Fashion Week|url=http://boldfacers.com/index.cfm?page=profile&amp;profile_id=311|publisher=Boldfacers|accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took place from September 23 to 30, 2011. Access to The Tent was only under special invitation, which made this event front-page news. It consisted in a 3 000 square-foot tent containing 200 seats, established between the [[Prudential Center]] and the [[Mandarin Oriental Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muther|first=Christopher|title=Spotlight on Fashion Week|journal=The Boston Globe|date=August 18, 2013|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2011/09/21/spotlight-fashion-week/MpPQYTsy7tKIyyW0Btnl7N/story.html|accessdate=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 20 designers were present and each one of them had 15 minutes to showcase their creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowen|first=Jared|title=Boston Fashion Week Review|journal=WGBH|date=September 30, 2011|url=http://www.wgbh.org/articles/Boston-Fashion-Week-Review-4389|accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Tent 2012 ===

The second year of The Tent was presented with a twist. Unlike the previous year, a [[parade]] of well-known designers, including style guru Marilyn Riseman and the [http://www.schooloffashiondesign.org Fashion School of Design] recruiter Jane Conway Caspe, skimmed through 80 possible designer's and chose the best 10 (nine of which were local, while the other one was from [[California]]. Those selected few, had their creations showcased at The Tent.

According to Boston Fashion Week’s founder, Jay Calderin, he was looking for diversity of styles on the [[runway]], instead of 10 gown designers and 10 [[wedding]] dress designers, like the last year's event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muther|first=Christopher|title=Where the fashion action is|journal=The Boston Globe|date=September 26, 2012|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/fashion/2012/09/26/boston-fashion-week-returns/ams6uEYkC0JfJtKJhXjOJL/story.html|accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed for an edgier, original, and more varied edition of the Tent.

=== The end of The Tent ===

When it first started in 2011, the tent at Boston Fashion Week was front-page news. In 2013, The Boston Fashion Week surprised its spectators with the cancellation of The Tent. Scheduled from September 27 until October 5, the fashion week in 2013 was not anchored by an official tent.

The reason behind the cancellation of The Tent in 2013 was the lack of [[sponsorship]] in order to continue paying its expenses. According to Calderin, The Tent helped encourage up-coming designers to come forward, and show them a new level of production. It is uncertain if The Tent will return in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;Shanahan, Mark and Goldstein, Meredith. "No More Tent at Boston Fashion Week".

'''Cold Big Bang''' is a designation used in [[cosmology]] to denote an [[absolute zero]] temperature at the beginning of the Universe, instead of a (hot) [[Big Bang]].

In an attempt to understand the origin of [[atoms]], [[Georges Lemaître]] proposed (by 1927) that before the [[expansion of the universe]] started all the [[matter]] in the [[universe]], it formed a gigantic ball of nuclear liquid at [[Low temperature physics|very low temperature]]. This low temperature was required to provide a sufficient [[Cohesion-tension theory|cohesion]] within the [[Georges Lemaître|Lemaître]]'s primeval atom.   In 1966, [[David Layzer]] proposed a variant on Lemaître's cosmology in which the initial [[Thermodynamic state|state]] of the universe was near [[absolute zero]].  Layzer argued that, rather than in an initial high [[entropy]] state, the [[:wikt:primordial|primordial]] universe was in a very low entropy state near absolute zero.    

The mainstream version of the Cold Big Bang model predicted an absence of [[Acoustics|acoustic]] peaks in the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aguirre|first=Anthony N.|title=The Cosmic Background Radiation in a Cold Big Bang|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=10 April 2000|volume=533|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1086/308660|bibcode=2000ApJ...533....1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually explicitly ruled out by [[WMAP]] observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Komatsu|first=E. |author2=Smith, K.

{{Costume}}

A '''costume party''' ([[American English]]) or a '''fancy dress party''' ([[British English]]) is a type of [[party]], common mainly in contemporary [[Western culture]], where guests dress up in [[costume]]s. Costumed [[Halloween]] parties are popular in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

==By country==
===Australia===
Australian fancy dress parties typically follows the style of the United States, and Halloween costume parties have been common since the early 1990s, even though Halloween has not historically been a celebrated event in Australia. Typical events for Australians that involve dressing up are the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]], the staff Christmas party and [[cricket]] matches.

One of the oldest examples of fancy dress being worn in Australia is on display at the [[Western Australia Museum]]. It was a child's fancy dress costume worn by Rita Lloyd, aged nine, to the ‘Lord Mayor’s Juvenile Fancy Dress Ball’ at Mansion House in [[Perth]] on 8 January 1909.

===Iraq===
It is a tradition to have a costume party at a university graduation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.niqash.org/en/articles/society/3436/&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Nineteenth century====
[[File:Fancy Dress Ball Perigal.jpg|thumb|Manchester fancy dress ball of 1828, painting by [[Arthur Perigal]]]]

The origins of fancy dress parties in the United Kingdom can in some respects be traced to [[Masquerade ball|masked balls]] of the 18th century period. In the period to 1850, fancy dress balls were a typical part of the social life of [[music festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pippa Drummond|title=The Provincial Music Festival in England, 1784-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oklkS-IJyPAC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=22 September 2013|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-3281-4|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common costumes of the period were specific historical characters, generic historical or regional clothing, abstract concepts (such as "winter", "starlight" or "night"), and objects (such as "champagne bottle" or "aquarium").  Popular characters included, for women, [[Marie Antoinette]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], and for men, [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] and [[Robin Hood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mimimatthews.com/2016/08/01/a-victorian-fancy-dress-ball-popular-costumes-of-the-late-19th-century/|title=A Victorian Fancy Dress Ball|date=August 1, 2016|work=mimimatthews.com|first=Mimi|last=Matthews|accessdate=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Twentieth century====
Notable amongst early events in the 20th century was the [[Chelsea Arts Club]] ball. Such events were often elaborate affairs and for the most part confined to those with considerable means.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Amongst the general population, costume parties also occurred with increasing frequency from the late 1940s onward, although for the most part the costumes were simple affairs until the mid-1970s. Prior to 'cheap' costume imports from the Far East /[[East Asia]] (late 1990s),{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} most costumes were either hired, or home constructed.  Retail purchased costumes are, in respect of the U.K., a largely modern phenomenon (late 1990s onward) although 'accessory' items had been available for some time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Since the increased import rate in late 1990s onwards saw the many materials / products being imported from the Far East (with cost savings in labour and bulk orders). This has seen the price of purchased costumes becoming more and more affordable.

Coupled with the modern trend in costume parties, 'retro' fashion as a costume theme (such as a 1970s or 1980s fancy dress) is also popular, the costumes to some extent parodying or pastiching the fashions of earlier decades.  Amongst the most popular parodied costumes are: [[Audrey Hepburn]] (as [[Holly Golightly (character)|Holly Golightly]]), [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in her classic stage outfits, and more recently [[Lady Gaga]].

Fancy dress parties are popular year round in the United Kingdom. The 1996 novel ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' features the classic British costume party theme "Tarts and Vicars" at which the women wear sexually provocative ("tart") costumes, while the men dress as [[Anglicanism|Anglican priests]] ("[[vicar]]s").  Fancy dress parties have been held by the [[British Royal Family]].  [[Prince William]], heir to the British Throne, celebrated his 21st birthday with an "Out of Africa" theme, [[Princess Beatrice of York]] chose an 1888 themed party for her 18th birthday, and [[Lord Frederick Windsor|Lord Frederick ("Freddie") Windsor]] and his sister [[Gabriella Windsor|Lady Gabriella Windsor]], celebrated a joint birthday party with a pre-[[French Revolution]] courtly theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1822830,00.html| title = You shall go to the ball | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2006-07-18 | last = Freeman | first = Hadley | accessdate = 2006-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:The Costume Contest Lineup.JPG|thumb|Contestants line up for a "best costume" competition at a Halloween party in the United States.]]

====Nineteenth century====
In late nineteenth century New York, costume parties were popular amongst the affluent.  Costumes were typically historical European aristocracy.  Authenticity was important, even extending to using actual period elements.  For example, Cornelia Bradley-Martin attended her own party, the notorious [[Bradley-Martin Ball]], dressed as [[Marie Antoinette]], wearing jewellery actually owned and worn by Antoinette herself.  The choice of aristocratic costume allowed rich Americans, with relatively limited family history, to assume some element of history and legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/costume-and-culture/2013/jun/11/victorian-socialites-fancy-dress-excess|title=Victorian socialites who used fancy dress to excess|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|first=Barbara|last=Brownie|date=11 June 2013|accessdate=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Twentieth century====
Costume parties are especially popular in the [[United States]] around [[Halloween]], when [[teenager]]s and [[adult]]s who may be considered too old for [[trick-or-treating]] attend a costume party instead. Costume parties are also popular during the [[carnival]] season, such as at [[Mardi Gras]].

Attendees occasionally dress in costume for popular science fiction and fantasy events, movie openings and book releases. Web site [[theonering.net]] held a ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' dress Oscar party that was attended by [[Peter Jackson]]. ''[[Star Wars]]'' parties were held to celebrate the opening of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]''. Many bookstores have held ''[[Harry Potter]]'' themed parties to celebrate the releases of the series' later novels, and some movie theaters have had Potter-themed celebrations as the movie adaptations have been released.

Larger scale 'parties' are often related to organised societies or [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evenues.com/event-planning-guide/types-of-meetings-and-events|title=Types of Meetings and Events - eVenues.com|website=eVenues|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fan costuming==
The hobby of fan costuming and modern cosplay largely developed from the [[World Science Fiction Convention]]s (Worldcons), starting with the first in New York in 1939 when two attendees, [[Forrest J Ackerman]] and [[Myrtle R. Douglas]], wore "futuristicostumes".&lt;ref name="Resnick"&gt;{{cite book|title=Always a Fan|first=Mike|last=Resnick|chapter=Wolrdcon Masquerades|pages=106–110|publisher=Wildside Press|year=2015|isbn=9781434448149}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[2nd World Science Fiction Convention]] (1940) in Chicago, [[masquerade ball]]s were a traditional feature of the convention.&lt;ref name="Resnick" /&gt;

===Conventions===
[[Fan convention]]s, often abbreviated to "cons", of various descriptions have followed the example of the Worldcons with many attendees wearing costumes representing fictional characters.  Some conventions feature costume competitions and other scheduled costuming events.  Several well-known conventions that feature costuming include the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], [[New York Comic-Con]], and Atlanta's [[Dragon Con]].

===Cosplay===
[[Cosplay]] (a blend of "costume" and "play" via the Japanese {{Nihongo||コスプレ|kosupure}}) was coined by Nobuyuki Takahashi in reporting on the [[42nd World Science Fiction Convention]] for Japanese magazine ''My Anime''.&lt;ref name="yah140724"&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam K. |last=Raymond |publisher=[[Yahoo! Movies]] |title=75 Years Of Capes and Face Paint: A History of Cosplay |url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/75-years-of-capes-and-face-paint-a-history-of-cosplay-92666923267.html |date=July 24, 2014 |accessdate=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yeinjee"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://yeinjee.com/tag/nobuyuki-nov-takahashi/ |title=Nobuyuki (Nov) Takahashi " YeinJee's Asian Blog: The Origin of the word cosplay |publisher=Yeinjee.com |date=2008-07-03 |accessdate=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character.  Cosplay is popular at conventions across the world.

== Events and themes ==

There are many annual [[Party|events]] that generate the chance to dress up in fancy dress [[costumes]]; [[Christmas]], [[New Year]], birthdays, [[Bachelor party|Hen and Stag parties]], and Book Day, amongst others.

[[Halloween]] is the most popular costume or fancy dress event of the year in western society.  Halloween originated centuries ago, the Celts believed that on 31 October the line between the living and the dead became distorted, condemned souls would come back to wreak havoc for the night. In defense, the Celts would dress up in ghoulish costumes to scare evil spirits away.

Within many [[fancy dress]] events, a theme is usually present, and with fancy dress outfits often from [[Hollywood films]] such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'', ''[[James Bond]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man]]''. Themes are also extremely popular with fundraising events, such as the ''Great Gorilla Run'', where 1,000 people dressed as [[gorilla]]s in London in aid for ''Great Gorillas'', a charity that focuses on the [[endangered species]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Some costume parties are themed around [[80s fashion]]. The most popular costumes researched for such fancy dress are the [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] Look, [[punk fashion]] and neon-colored clothing. Some of the easiest and cheapest 1980s costumes include ''[[John Rambo|Rambo]]'', [[Samantha Fox]], and [[Tom Cruise]] from ''[[Risky Business]]'' or ''[[Top Gun]]''. Alternative eighties costumes include dresses, prom dresses and denim from the period, including high waisted pants and [[stone wash]] denim.

Fans sometimes attend sporting events in a costume as a sign of support of their favored team. Some sporting events have large numbers of fans attending in fancy dress costume, notably the [[Wellington Sevens|Wellington Rugby Sevens]] where almost every fan who attends wears some sort of costume.

'''Day of the Foundation of the Republic''' ({{lang-ko|인민정권 창건일}}) is the [[Republic Day]] and [[National day]]&lt;ref name="Hunter2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Helen-Louise|chapter=The Society and Its Environment|title=North Korea: A Country Study|editor-last=Worden|editor-first=Robert L.|chapter-url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2008028547/|edition=Fifth|date=2008|location=Washington|publisher=Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress|ISBN=978-0-8444-1188-0|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]], held on 9 September.

The Day of the Foundation of the Republic is one of the most important holidays of the country, along with the [[Day of the Sun]] (birthday of [[Kim Il-sung]]), [[Day of the Shining Star]] (birthday of [[Kim Jong-il]]) and [[Party Foundation Day]].&lt;ref name="Seoul2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yonhap News Agency, Seoul|title=North Korea Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIlh9nNeadMC&amp;pg=PA451|date=27 December 2002|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-3523-5|pages=451–452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following the [[Liberation of Korea]] in 1945 by the Soviet and American forces, a communist Soviet military regime was set up in the northern part of Korea. A new [[Supreme People's Assembly]] was elected in August 1948, and on 3 September a [[Constitution of North Korea|new constitution]] was promulgated. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was proclaimed on 9 September, with [[Kim Il-sung]] as [[Premier of North Korea|Premier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |p=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the date is 9 September, it is also called simply 9 · 9 (old version). 

==National celebrations==
The holiday is celebrated throughout the country.&lt;ref name="ency_Birt"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Democratic People's Republic of Korea Founding Day|publisher=Omnigraphics|via=TheFreeDictionary.com|title=Holidays, Festivals, and Celebrations of the World Dictionary|edition=Fourth| date=2010|accessdate=13 January 2017|chapter-url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Democratic+People%27s+Republic+of+Korea+Founding+Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this day, events such as art performances, exhibitions, athletic events, and reports are held. On jubilee years (ex: 60th anniversary, 65th anniversary), military parades on [[Kim Il-sung Square]] take place with the participation of the [[leader of North Korea]]. It is also common for new children to be admitted to the [[Young Pioneer Corps]] on the day.&lt;ref name="Hunter2008"/&gt;

In contrast to many other holidays that are very politicized, the Foundation Day concerns the whole country. It also has an international and diplomatic outlook with foreigners being likelier to attend it than some other holidays.&lt;ref name="nkne_IsNo"/&gt;

The day was first celebrated in 1949. The intensity of celebrations has varied considerably. Celebrations in 1950 were low key due to the [[Korean War]]. In contrast, 1956 saw sizeable celebrations following Kim Il-sung's triumph in a domestic political crisis just days earlier called the [[August Faction Incident]]. In 1997 the [[Juche calendar|''Juche'' calendar]] was adopted on September 9, which became September 9, ''Juche'' 86.&lt;ref name="nkne_IsNo"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Is North Korea's 9/9 Foundation Day its most important holiday?|last=Tertitskiy|first=Fyodor|work=NK News|date=8 September 2018|access-date=9 September 2018|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/09/is-north-koreas-99-foundation-day-its-most-important-holiday/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, North Korea marked the 70th anniversary of its foundation. Russian [[Chairman of the Federation Council (Russia)|Federation Council Chairman]] [[Valentina Matviyenko]] and Mauritanian President [[Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz]], as well as delegations from [[Cuba]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Uganda]], and [[South Africa]] were in attendance during the celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tass.com/politics/1020375/amp|title=Russian upper house speaker Matviyenko to pay official visit to N.

'''Thora Afton Chamberlain''' (born November 22, 1930)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://charleyproject.org/case/thora-afton-chamberlain|title=Thora Afton Chamberlain – The Charley Project|website=charleyproject.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a female 14-year-old American [[Secondary school|high school]] student who was reported missing and presumably murdered on November 2, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/05/21/a-forerunner-to-sierra-lamar-case/|title=Eerie echoes of 1945 case in Sierra LaMar’s fate|date=2017-05-21|work=The Mercury News|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Thomas Henry McMonigle was convicted for Chamberlain's murder, [[murder conviction without a body|her body was never found]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-scientist-who-wanted-to-bring-a-death-row-inmate-ba-1692200257|title=The Scientist Who Wanted To Bring A Death Row Inmate Back From The Dead|last=Davis|first=Lauren|work=io9|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disappearance ==
Chamberlain was last seen outside Campbell High School in [[Campbell, California]], after the end of her classes. According to her classmates, she spoke for several minutes with a motorist on Winchester Boulevard, who told her he was looking for someone to babysit his sister's children for the afternoon. The man wore a [[US Navy]] uniform and military medals. Chamberlain accepted the offer and got into the car with him.

== Investigation ==
Law enforcement's suspicions fell immediately upon Thomas Henry McMonigle, a [[San Mateo, California]], resident with an arrest record going back to his teens and including antecedents for assault and [[attempted rape]]. McMonigle had left the area immediately and moved to his father's home in [[Illinois]]. On December 6, McMonigle attempted to commit [[suicide]] with an overdose of [[Hypnotic|sleeping pills]] while riding a bus to [[San Francisco]], but he was rushed to a hospital and made a full recovery. After his discharge, he was immediately arrested by [[FBI]] agents investigating Chamberlain's disappearance.

McMonigle, who had never served in the [[Navy]], confessed to have found the uniform and medals in a [[footlocker (luggage)|footlocker]] that he had stolen from a real serviceman. This footlocker was found in McMonigle's home's [[Garage (residential)|garage]] in [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo]]. However, he offered wildly varying stories about Chamberlain's death and what had happened to her body. At various times, McMonigle claimed to have murdered Chamberlain by shooting, stabbing or strangling her; to have shot her accidentally; to have seen her die after a fall from his car; and to not be involved in her death at all. An examination of McMonigle's car found a [[bullet]] hole in the inside of a door, lending credence to the idea that Chamberlain had been shot in the vehicle. McMonigle claimed to have removed the bullet from the door and buried it under a certain tree in his backyard; and also to have ripped out the car's padding and upholstery because they had been stained with Chamberlain's blood, and subsequently buried them in a drainage ditch near his workplace. Both places were searched, and the bullet and car parts (still covered in blood) were recovered successfully. The bullet was tested and proven to have been fired from McMonigle's .32 caliber [[Colt revolver]].

McMonigle also claimed to have thrown Chamberlain's body off a cliff overlooking Half Moon Bay on the San Mateo County coast, known as the Devil's Slide. Police searched the area and found two pairs of red and blue socks wedged on the cliff's face, which were recognized by Chamberlain's parents. McMonigle's claim that he had buried Chamberlain's clothes in his backyard could not be confirmed, but a separate excavation by the FBI at the construction site where McGonigle had been working at the time of the disappearance turned up a pair of shoes, schoolbooks, papers, a zippered binder and a [[cowbell]] property of Chamberlain.

== Prosecution of McMonigle ==
The prosecution theorized that McMonigle abducted Chamberlain with the intention of raping her, murdered her when she tried to resist, and later carried her body to the Devil's Slide and tossed it into the ocean. He was pronounced guilty by the jury after only 38 minutes of deliberation, and [[death penalty|sentenced to die]] in the [[gas chamber]]. While in [[death row]], he confessed to the murder of a [[San Francisco]] woman and later to have murdered eleven people overall, but he was not charged with more murders. In his last statement before his execution in 1948, however, McMonigle claimed that he was not involved in Chamberlain's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://whereaboutsstillunknown.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/thora-chamberlain/|title=Thora Chamberlain|date=2014-08-25|work=Whereabouts Still Unknown|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Handekzem hyperkeratotisch-rhagadiform.jpg|thumb|right|250px|This individual suffers from [[hand eczema]], which causes much harm to the skin.]]

'''Disfigurement''' is the state of having one's appearance deeply and persistently harmed medically, such as from a disease, [[birth defect]], or wound. General societal attitudes towards disfigurement have varied greatly across cultures and over time, with cultures possessing strong [[social stigma]] against it often causing [[psychological distress]] to disfigured individuals. Alternatively, many societies have regarded some forms of disfigurement in a medical, scientific context where someone having ill will against the disfigured is viewed as anathema. In various religious and spiritual contexts, disfigurement has been vaoriously described as being as a punishment from the divine for sin (such as [[Yahweh]]'s [[Curse and mark of Cain|defacement of Cain]] for [[Cain and Abel|Abel]]'s murder in Judaism), as being (such as [[Apostle Paul|Paul]] of the [[New Testament]]'s arguments about [[Christ]]'s sufferings) caused by [[supernatural force]]s of hate and [[conflict between good and evil|evil against the good]] and just, which will be later atoned for, or as being without explanation ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' with people just having to endure.

The topic has been frequently commented on and referred to in a great many forms of fictional media as well. [[Villain]]ous examples include the iconic fiend [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] from various [[DC Comics]] and the mysterious figure with a "red right hand" from the [[Red Right Hand|song of the same name]] by band [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]. [[Hero]]ic examples include [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], a crime-fighter who was rendered [[Blindness|blind]] (from [[Marvel Comics]]), and the compassionate character [[Edward Scissorhands]] from the film of the same name.

==Overview==
Disfigurement, whether caused by a benign or malignant condition, often leads to severe [[psychosocial]] problems such as negative [[body image]]; [[clinical depression|depression]]; difficulties in one's social, sexual, and professional lives; prejudice; and intolerance. This is partly due to how the individual copes with looking 'visibly different', though the extent of the disfigurement rarely correlates with the degree of distress the sufferer feels. An additional factor which affects sufferers of a disfigurement is the reaction they get from other people. Studies have shown that the general population respond to people with a disfigurement with less trust, less respect and often try to avoid making contact or having to look at the disfigurement. Disfigurements affecting visible areas such as the face, arms and hands are thought to present greater difficulty for sufferers to cope with than do other disfigurements.

Deliberate mutilation resulting in physical disfigurement has also been practiced by many cultures throughout human history for religious or judicial purposes. During the [[Byzantine Empire]], the emperor was considered God's [[wikt:viceregent|viceregent]] on Earth, and as such the physical wholeness of his person was an essential complement to the perfection of Heaven. For this reason, many deposed emperors were blinded, had [[Rhinotomy|their noses cut off]], or [[Tongue splitting|their tongue split]] by their successors, as these permanent disfigurements disqualified them from ever reclaiming the throne.

A case of voluntary disfigurement is that of St. [[Æbbe the Younger]] and the nuns of [[Coldingham Monastery]] in Scotland. When the monastery was attacked by [[Viking]]s and they feared being raped, she and the nuns cut off their own noses and upper lips. In revenge, the Vikings burned down the building with the nuns inside. This is said to be the origin of the phrase "[[cutting off the nose to spite the face]]".

==Causes==
Conditions that can cause disfigurement include:

[[Plastic surgery]] or [[reconstructive surgery]] is available in many cases to disfigured people. Some [[health insurance]] companies and government [[health care systems]] cover [[plastic surgery]] for these problems when they do not generally cover plastic surgery for what is labeled as "cosmetic purposes".

The term "disfigurement" is sometimes used pejoratively to describe the results of intentional [[body modification]]. [[Scarification]] and other forms of such modification will sometimes be referred to as such by neutral parties or by advocates of the processes as well. Many types of body modification are subject to strong social debate as such.

==Society and culture==
People with disfigurement are often treated badly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MOSAIC|first1=Neil Steinberg|title=Facial discrimination: Living with a disfigured face|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/23/health/facial-discrimination-disfigured-face/index.html|website=CNN|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In most every adaptation (literary, stage, film, or otherwise) of [[The Phantom of the Opera]], the title character (known as "[[Erik (Phantom of the Opera)|Erik]]" or "[[Erik (Phantom of the Opera)|The Phantom]]") wears either a full or half-face mask to conceal a disfigurement. Some adaptations infer that his disfigurement was present from birth, such as in the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] [[The Phantom of the Opera (musical)|musical]], whereas others infer or show it to be the result of a horrible accident such as burning from fire or chemicals. The Phantom's disfigured face is usually described as having caused him anguish and despair, thus influencing him to adopt the enigmatic "phantom" persona.&lt;ref&gt;[http://operaghost.scriptmania.com/face.html The Phantom's Visage: What did the Phantom Look Like?]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[DC Comics]] character the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], often a foe of [[Batman]], possesses a [[clown]]-like grin and a grotesque combination of bleached skin, red lips, and green hair that are typically described or inferred to be the result of injuries and disfigurement in most media. A common origin of his skin and hair colors revolve around chemical burns as the result of the Joker character either falling into, jumping into, or being thrown into a vat of noxious chemicals. In [[Tim Burton]]'s [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 film adaptation of ''Batman'']], the Joker character, in this version a criminal originally known as "Jack Napier", receives his distinct "grin" as the result of a botched [[plastic surgery]] that he received after a [[Ricochet|ricocheted bullet]] that Napier intended to harm Batman badly injured the Joker's face. In most media, the Joker's mania and insanity begin as a result of him seeing his own disfigurement, the 1989 film being an example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://batman.neoseeker.com/wiki/Joker Joker]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ridingtohellinahandbasket.com/post/6946509702/the-juxtaposition-of-batman-and-joker The Juxtaposition of Batman and Joker]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|33JK0zOtJOk|Jack Napier (Joker) falls into a vat of chemical}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiAonyJIV_A The Joker Transformation!

A '''downer''' is an animal, usually [[livestock]], that cannot stand on its own and therefore is to be killed.  A '''downed''' animal, one that is unable to stand, is not necessarily a downer.

The animal's inability to stand may be caused by illness or injury. In nearly all cases it is considered by most farmers to be both [[animal welfare|humane]] and cost-effective to kill the animal when it becomes a downer, rather than keeping it alive and unhealthy. Once killed, and depending on how the animal became a downer and how it was killed, the animal may then be [[Incineration|incinerated]], [[Burial|buried]], [[Rendering (food processing)|rendered]], or [[Animal slaughter|slaughtered]].  Because of [[mad cow disease]], the slaughter of downer [[cattle]] is a topic of great concern.

There are many possible reasons for an animal staying down, including:
*[[Mastitis]]
*[[Metritis]]
*[[Hypomagnesaemia]]
*[[Hypocalcaemia]]
*[[Ketosis]]
*[[Dystocia]]
**Nerve damage
**[[Pelvic]] [[fracture]]
*[[Long bone]] fracture
*[[Neurological]] disease

==United States==

A longstanding issue is whether these animals are treated humanely or inhumanely by shippers, stockyards, and packers while they are being moved or held for slaughter.  Legislation periodically is introduced in Congress to outlaw the sale or transfer of such animals, but livestock producer groups (who generally agree that livestock markets should not accept severely disabled animals) have long contended that their voluntary efforts to end harmful practices have already proven successful. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 10815) required the USDA to investigate and submit a report on nonambulatory livestock, and to issue and enforce regulations, if deemed necessary, to provide for their humane treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition – Order Code 97-905] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810044532/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=August 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different jurisdictions have different rules about what can be done with a downer cow. In some jurisdictions the cow may be slaughtered without question. In others, downer cattle may not be slaughtered even if the cause is a physical injury. In the [[United States]], meat inspection is usually an [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce issue]], and is regulated by the [[Federal Meat Inspection Act]]. Now all livestock auction barns are not allowed to take sick or downer cows because of the rulings that originated with the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] "mad cow" crisis.

==Canada==

In Canada, transportation of animals is federally regulated. The Health of Animals Regulations&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110605050630/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cr/C.R.C.-c.296/bo-ga%3Al_XII//en Health of Animals]&lt;/ref&gt; state that an animal has to be fit for the intended journey and that a non-ambulatory animal cannot be transported because transport would cause additional suffering.

The Canadian authority responsible for the welfare of animals that are transported is the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/trans/polie.shtml Transportation of Animals Program: Compromised Animals Policy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204211242/http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/trans/polie.shtml |date=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mad cow disease==
The downer issue took on another dimension when [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE) was found in two North American cows in 2003. Many experts believe that nonambulatory cattle are at higher risk of harboring BSE. As a result, on December 30, 2003 the USDA announced an immediate ban on the slaughter of downer cattle for human [[food]] use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentidonly=true&amp;contentid=2008/08/0218.xml USDA Announces Proposed Rule for Requirements of the Disposition of Downer Cattle] - [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] (2008-08-27)&lt;/ref&gt;  At issue is how to monitor the hundreds of thousands of U.S. downer cattle (annual estimate) if they are no longer presented for observation and testing at [[meat packing]] plants; also at issue is what to do with their remains, and whether they have any non-food value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition – Order Code 97-905] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810044532/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=August 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EcoVelocity''' was an annual motor show in London that focusses on electric and low-carbon cars. The first show in 2011 was launched at [[Battersea Power Station]], and the 2012 show was located at the [[ExCeL London|ExCel]] exhibition centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London’s ExCeL centre to host this year’s EcoVelocity motor show|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/02/02/londons-excel-centre-to-host-ecovelocity-europes-biggest-electric-and-low-carbon-motor-show-306018/|work=Metro|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed Future Drive Motor Show for 2013, but this was subsequently cancelled.

==2011 show==
The first show took place between 8-11 September at the Battersea Power station in West London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electric supercars at EcoVelocity|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/green-motoring/8720311/Electric-supercars-at-EcoVelocity.html|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show featured 17 marques including Tesla, Toyota and Nissan, and organised 7,000 on-site test drives. Overall visitor numbers were 8,700 and the show was organised by [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] newspaper and International Green Motor Events.

==2012 show==
The second show took place between 10-13 May at the East London ExCel exhibition centre and was organised by [[Media 10]] following their acquisition of IGME in February 2012. By co-locating with the [[Grand Designs]] exhibition, numbers were up seven-fold to nearly 58,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EcoVelocity smashes record visitor numbers|url=http://www.eventmagazine.co.uk/Business/article/1133993/EcoVelocity-smashes-record-visitor-numbers/|work=Event Magazine|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==2013 show==
At the end of 2012 the show organisers announced that the 2013 EcoVelocity show would be reformatted and incorporated into the new Future Drive Motor Show, but remain at the London ExCeL centre and would be held between 5-12 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London to host new motor show in 2013|url=http://www.motortrader.com/latest-news/london-host-motor-show-2013/|work=MotorTrader.com|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Only four weeks before the show, Future Drive was cancelled by Media 10 due to a lack of exhibitors signed up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sunderland|first=Faye|title=Future Drive Motor Show gets canned|url=http://www.thegreencarwebsite.co.uk/blog/index.php/2013/04/02/future-drive-motor-show-gets-canned/|work=Green Car Website|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Empire Fire''' was a wildfire that burned in [[Yosemite National Park]] in [[California]] in the [[United States]]. The fire was reported on August 1, 2017 and was caused by lightning. It burned {{Convert|8,094|acre|km2|0}}, before it was fully contained on November 27. The fire affected recreational activities in the national park.

==The fire==

The Empire Fire was reported on August 1, 2017 at 8:45 AM. It is located east of [[Badger Pass Ski Area]] and next to [[Bridalveil Creek Campground]] in [[Yosemite National Park]]. The fire was naturally caused, possibly by [[lightning]]. It was fueled by [[red fir]] timber, dormant brush, green leaf [[manzanita]], chinquapan brush, and dead and down material.&lt;ref name=InciWeb/&gt;

On November 27, the fire was reported to be 100% contained.&lt;ref name="InciWeb" /&gt;

[[File:Essjay.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Essjay from his Wikia profile]]

The '''Essjay controversy''' involved a prominent [[Wikipedia]] participant and salaried [[Wikia]] employee, known by the username Essjay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|first1=TIME|title=These Are Wikipedia's Top 15 Moments|url=http://time.com/4178708/wikipedia-moments-15th-anniversary-history-timeline/|accessdate=July 2, 2017|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beam|first1=Alex|title=Tricky truths behind Wikipedia|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/03/12/tricky_truths_behind_wikipedia/|accessdate=July 2, 2017|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=March 12, 2007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; who later identified himself as '''Ryan Jordan'''. Jordan held trusted volunteer positions within Wikipedia known as "[[Wikipedia administrators|administrator]]", "bureaucrat", and "[[Arbitration Committee (English Wikipedia)|arbitrator]]".

On July 24, 2006, Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt started a thread titled "Who is Essjay?" (later retitled "Who is Essjay?, Probably he's Ryan Jordan" after Jordan's self-disclosure) on the forum site [[Wikipedia Review]].&lt;ref name="whoisessjay"&gt;[http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=2778 "Who is Essjay?, Probably he's Ryan Jordan"]&lt;!-- https://www.webcitation.org/5PqGIQCYB?url=http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s%3Db12b53b5dd1d1cdaaf428418e050120c%26showtopic%3D2778%26st%3D0%26p%3D20396%26 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing discussion brought to light contradictions in claims Essjay made about his [[academic degree|academic qualifications]] and professional experiences on his Wikipedia user page. Jordan claimed that he held [[doctorate|doctoral degrees]] in [[theology]] and [[canon law]] and worked as a tenured professor at a private university. Five days later, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' published an interview with Essjay which repeated some of the claims.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;Schiff, Stacy. [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/07/31/060731fa_fact "Know it all: Can Wikipedia conquer expertise?"], ''The New Yorker'', July 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia Review found definitive proof that Jordan made false claims about his qualifications and experience, including that he was a "tenured professor", a claim that was used to describe Essjay in the interview for ''The New Yorker''. In January 2007, Brandt contacted the author of the article in ''The New Yorker'' about the discrepancies in Jordan's biography and the exploitation of his supposed qualifications as leverage in internal disputes over Wikipedia content.

The controversy that ensued focused on his falsification of a persona and qualifications, the impact of this deception on perceptions of Wikipedia (and its policies and credibility), and the quality of decisions made in his promotion, support, and employment.&lt;ref name=King&gt;Ian King, {{cite web|url=http://vancouver.24hrs.ca/Columnists/KingsCorner/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070302123251/http://vancouver.24hrs.ca/Columnists/KingsCorner/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 2, 2007 | title='A Wiki web they've woven' |publisher=vancouver.24hrs.ca|accessdate=March 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=times2&gt;Cohen, Noam.

==''The New Yorker'' interview==
[[Stacy Schiff]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning journalist writing for ''The New Yorker'', interviewed Essjay as a source for an article about Wikipedia ("Know It All"; July 31, 2006) after he was recommended to her by a member of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. According to ''The New Yorker'', Essjay "was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page."&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt;

During the interview, Jordan told ''The New Yorker'' and had previously stated on his Wikipedia user page that he held [[doctorate|doctoral degrees]] in theology and [[canon law]] and worked as a tenured professor at a private university.&lt;ref name="deluserpage"/&gt; It was later discovered that he was 24 years old, and had [[Dropping out|dropped out]] of [[community college]] with no qualifications.&lt;ref name="louisville"/&gt; ''The New Yorker'' published a correction in February 2007, which brought the issue to broader public attention.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt;

The article said that Essjay spent some 14 hours or more a day on Wikipedia but was careful to keep his online life a secret from his colleagues and friends. It portrayed Essjay as often taking his laptop to class so he could be available to other Wikipedians while giving a quiz. He asserted that he required anonymity to avoid [[cyberstalking]].&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt;

Jordan, as Essjay, claimed he sent an email to a college professor using his invented persona's credentials, vouching for Wikipedia's accuracy. In the message he wrote in part, "I am an administrator of the online encyclopedia project Wikipedia. I am also a tenured professor of theology; feel free to have a look at my Wikipedia user page (linked below) to gain an idea of my background and credentials."&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="User:EssjayLetter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Essjay/Letter |title=User:Essjay/Letter |publisher=WebCite |accessdate=November 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5N2MZaMWP?url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%3AEssjay/Letter |archivedate=March 2, 2007 |df=mdy }}{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later commented on his Wikipedia user page about having fooled Schiff by "... doing a good job playing the part."&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt then wrote a letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=2778&amp;st=20&amp;p=21049&amp;mode=linear#entry21049 |title=(untitled letter to Stacy Schiff) |last=Brandt |first=Daniel |date=January 20, 2007 |publisher=The Wikipedia Review |accessdate=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; reporting the identity discrepancy to Stacy Schiff and ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt; In late February 2007, the magazine updated its article with a correction indicating that "Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan, that he is twenty-four and holds no advanced degrees, and that he has never taught."&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt;

On March 3, 2007, [[Andrew Lih]], Assistant Professor and Director of Technology Journalism and of the Media Studies Centre at the [[University of Hong Kong]],&lt;ref name="lih2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jmsc.hku.hk/faculty/alih/ |title=Andrew Lih |accessdate=November 5, 2007 |publisher=Hong Kong University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040613020832/http://jmsc.hku.hk/faculty/alih/ |archivedate=June 13, 2004 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; said on his blog that a portion of Essjay's comments on the incident entered "the dangerous domain of defamation and libel" against Stacy Schiff. Lih stated that on Essjay's Wikipedia talk page, Essjay had written, "Further, she [Schiff] made several offers to compensate me for my time, and my response was that if she truly felt the need to do so, she should donate to the Foundation instead." Lih noted:&lt;ref name="lih"/&gt;

{{quote|This is an accusation of the highest degree to make about a journalist. Paying a source for a story is an absolute no-no in the normal practice of print journalism.

Lih wrote that he contacted Schiff for comment about whether she had offered to pay Essjay for his time and quoted her return email. In it, Schiff stated that Essjay's assertion was "complete nonsense".&lt;ref name="lih"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewlih.com/blog/2007/03/03/essjays-third-transgression/|title=Essjay's Third Transgression|accessdate=October 1, 2007|date=November 5, 2007|author=Andrew Lih|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930193953/http://www.andrewlih.com/blog/2007/03/03/essjays-third-transgression/|archivedate=September 30, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==

Speaking personally about Jordan, Wales said, "Mr. Ryan{{sic}} was a friend, and still is a friend. He is a young man, and he has offered me a heartfelt personal apology, which I have accepted. I hope the world will let him go in peace to build an honorable life and reputation."&lt;ref name="Doran"&gt;{{cite web

Essjay had responded at the time with a statement on his Wikipedia page, in part reading:

Reaction from within the Wikipedia community to the Essjay/Jordan identity discrepancy was sharp, voluminous, and mixed. While most editors denounced at least some of his actions, responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

As the controversy unfolded, the Wikipedia community began a review of Essjay's previous edits and some felt he had relied upon his fictional professorship to influence editorial consideration of edits he made. "People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments", said Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator and founder of the Wikipedia community newspaper, [[Wikipedia Signpost|the ''Signpost'']]. "Those will get looked at again."&lt;ref name=times/&gt; For instance, Essjay had recommended sources such as ''[[for Dummies|Catholicism for Dummies]]'',&lt;ref name="CfD"&gt;{{cite book | author= Trigilio, John |author2=Brighenti, Kenneth | title = Catholicism for Dummies | date = April 28, 2003 | publisher = [[Wiley Publishing]] | location = [[Indianapolis, IN]] | isbn = 0-7645-5391-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book granted the ''[[nihil obstat]]'' and ''[[imprimatur]]'' by the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getfed.com/product_detail.cfm?ID=3837 |title=''Catholicism for Dummies'' |publisher=GetFed.com |accessdate=July 25, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040530221734/http://www.getfed.com/product_detail.cfm?ID=3837 |archivedate=May 30, 2004 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur: "This is a text I often require for my students, and I would hang my own Ph.D. on it's ''[sic]'' credibility."&lt;ref name=times /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AImprimatur&amp;diff=12614544&amp;oldid=12191093|

[[Jimmy Wales]] proposed a credential verification system on Wikipedia following the Essjay controversy, but the proposal was rejected.
Wales was "reported to be considering vetting all persons who adjudicate on factual disputes."&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{cite news |title= Wikipedia's 'bogus' editor ousted |url= http://www.freelanceuk.com/news/2163.shtml |publisher=Freelance UK|first= |last= Staff|date= March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I don't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia, but it does expose a weakness that we will be working to address", Wales added.&lt;ref name = "Doran" /&gt; He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished. "We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition, so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle", Wales commented. However, he also warned that "It's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials, and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate."&lt;ref name="Bergstein"&gt;{{cite news |title= After flap over phony professor, Wikipedia wants some writers to share real names |url= https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2007-03-07-wikipedia-credentials_N.htm |agency=Associated Press|first=Brian |last=Bergstein|authorlink=Brian Bergstein|date= March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Florence Devouard]], chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, was not supportive of his credential proposal, saying, "I think what matters is the quality of the content, which we can improve by enforcing policies such as 'cite your source,' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor." A formal proposal that users claiming to have academic qualifications would need to provide evidence before citing them in content disputes was eventually rejected by the Wikipedia community,&lt;ref name="Credentials"&gt;[[WP:CRED]]&lt;/ref&gt; like all previous such proposals.

As a follow-up to his initial comments to ''The New Yorker'', Wales wrote this apology to the magazine, which appeared in its March 19, 2007 issue:

{{quote|I am writing to apologize to ''The New Yorker'' and Stacy Schiff, and to give some follow-up concerning Ryan Jordan (Editors' Note, March 5). When I last spoke to ''The New Yorker'' about the fact that a prominent Wikipedia community member had lied about his credentials, I misjudged the issue. It was not O.K. for Mr. Jordan, or Essjay, to lie to a reporter, even to protect his identity.&lt;ref name="WalesApology" /&gt;}}

Wales expressed his regret that Essjay had "made a series of very bad judgments." He also commented that he hoped Wikipedia would improve as a result of the controversy.&lt;ref name="WalesApology" /&gt;

===Wikipedia critics===
[[File:Orlowski.jpg|upright|thumb|Journalist and Wikipedia critic [[Andrew Orlowski]]]]

[[Andrew Orlowski]], a frequent Wikipedia critic and writer for ''[[The Register]]''—a British technology news and opinion website—criticized Jimmy Wales for hiring Essjay at the [[venture-capital]]-funded Wikia and for appointing him to the [[Arbitration Committee (English Wikipedia)|Wikipedia Arbitration Committee]] after Essjay had apparently admitted his previously claimed academic and professional credentials were false. Orlowski added that Essjay's actions betrayed a dangerous community mindset within Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="Orlowski" /&gt;

Others to comment negatively included [[ZDNet]] writer Mitch Ratcliffe, who asked "why lying about one's background qualifies a person to work for a company like Wikia, which proposes to help communities to record accurate information" and asked for additional details "such as when he fired Jordan and the reasons for the firing, as well as when he endorsed Jordan in public statements."&lt;ref name="Ratcliffe"/&gt;

[[Larry Sanger]], co-founder of Wikipedia who left the project in 2002, called Essjay's response "a defiant non-apology"&lt;ref name="Farewell, Wikipedia?"&gt;{{cite web

Other comments:
* ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' commented on proposals for credential verification: "Sadly, not everyone who posts to Wikipedia is concerned with the Ten Commandments. Some are concerned with revenge. Some with self-aggrandizement. Some just have nothing better to do. We live in an age of fake IDs, fake money, fake e-mails, fake URLs, fake IP addresses, and fake votes..." However, the article argued that Wikipedia could not become a "net police" of reliability on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-03-22/wikipedias-not-the-net-policebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|title=Wikipedia's Not the Net Police|author=B.L.Ochman|publisher=''[[BusinessWeek]]''|date=March 22, 2007|accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Steve Maich]] (journalist, ''[[Maclean's]]'') stated that the controversy could damage Wikipedia's future as a media business operation, observing that Wikipedia's model was supposedly built upon trust and credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070319_103212_103212&amp;source=srch |title=Wikipedia's trouble with the truth |date=March 19, 2007 |author=Steve Maich |publisher=''[[Maclean's]]'' |accessdate=October 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111082534/http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070319_103212_103212&amp;source=srch |archivedate=January 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cassandra Jardine]], a ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' contributor, opined that Essjay was "hooked on 'Wiki crack'—devotees' jargon for the thrill of seeing your efforts debated." She further observed that "Essjay has provided a reminder that any given entry could have been written by someone as ignorant as ourselves. On the other hand, no one has taken issue with his edits, only his assumed persona, so perhaps the real lesson of this democratic medium is that college drop-outs might be as authoritative as professors."&lt;ref name=Jardine&gt;{{cite news

===Academics===
Following the media coverage of the Essjay controversy, a number of academics noted the damage to the credibility of Wikipedia. On March 2, 2007, a report in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' commented "the incident is clearly damaging to Wikipedia's credibility—especially with professors who will now note that one of the site's most visible academics has turned out to be a fraud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Essjay, the Ersatz Academic |url=http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/index.php?id=1909 |publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=March 2, 2007 |last=Read |first=Brock |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305162127/http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/index.php?id=1909 |archivedate=March 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross Brann, a professor of Judeo-Islamic studies at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], stated that Wikipedia lacks a process of scholarly review, saying, "They could make up your life if they wanted to." Brann also said that Wikipedia "has no place in the University", and he believed the Essjay incident would do nothing to change the unfavorable opinion that academics generally hold about the online encyclopedia.&lt;ref name = "CornellSun"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicola Pratt, a lecturer in international relations at the [[University of East Anglia]] in England, stated, "The ethos of Wikipedia is that anyone can contribute, regardless of status... What's relevant is their knowledge as judged by other readers, not whether they are professors or not—and the fact the student [Essjay] was exposed shows it works."&lt;ref name=G2&gt;{{cite web

The championship will be sanctioned by [[SCCA Pro Racing]], the professional racing division of the [[Sports Car Club of America]], in conjunction with the [[Automobile Competition Committee for the United States]], the United States representative to the FIA.&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2015/09/17/fia-formula-4-revealed-for-north-america/|title=FIA Formula 4 revealed for North America|last=DiZinno|first=Tony|date=17 September 2015|website=NBC Sports|publisher=[[NBC-Universal]]|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be a [[One make racing|spec series]], with all competitors using the same chassis and engine.

The championship is designed to support North American drivers entering international [[Open-wheel car|open-wheel]] racing, by using the same regulations used by other series globally, rather than compete with existing INDYCAR [[Road to Indy]] ladder, with the drivers earning points towards an FIA Superlicence. It will serve as an initial step into car racing for drivers graduating from [[karting]].&lt;ref name="Autosport" /&gt;

== Championship format ==
Each event of the championship will consist of three races, which will be run on the support package of other motorsport events in the United States and starting in 2017, Canada. The inaugural season comprises five events, and will expand to additional rounds in the following seasons.&lt;ref name="Autosport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/120857|title=United States Formula 4 Championship launched for 2016|last=Watkins|first=Gary|date=17 September 2015|website=Autosport.com|publisher=[[Haymarket Media]]|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially only run at race tracks on the East Coast of the United States, the championship will expand to separate East and West Coast series in the future with Canadian rounds in association with United States-based series.&lt;ref name="Autosport" /&gt;

The chassis will be provided by [[Onroak Automotive]], with a 2000cc [[Honda K engine|Honda K20]] detuned to 160hp and supplied by [[Honda Performance Development]], which will both meet the FIA price caps for Formula 4.&lt;ref name="NBC" /&gt; The tyres will by provided by [[Pirelli]], and will similarly be price capped. The total cost for a driver to compete in a full season of the 2016 championship is estimated at $115,000.&lt;ref name="NBC" /&gt;

The '''Washington DC Funk Parade''' is an annual music and art street festival held on [[U Street]] in [[Washington DC]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Rachel|title=Washington DC Funk Parade 2015 (U Street Music Festival)|url=http://dc.about.com/od/musicfestivals/fl/Washington-DC-Funk-Parade-ndash-U-Street-Music-Festival.htm|website=About.Com|publisher=About.com|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a free, day-long event that aims to unite the community through the celebration of funk music, visual arts and the diverse cultural history of the U Street neighborhood. The event features various live musical performances, live art demonstrations, community workshops and food vendors. The Funk Parade, in which dancers, marching bands, beat-boxers and various other creative art forms, closes the festival in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rude|first1=Justin|title=DC FUNK PARADE|url=http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/292282/23860150/1384004333160/FUNKPARADE.pdf?token=0IvZbEvGZRyQWnWWkJWfDuMRzkk%3D|website=Meridian Hill Neighborhood Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Funk Parade was held on May 3, 2014.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Funk Parade Takes Over U Street on Saturday|url=http://dcist.com/2015/04/the_funk_parade_takes_over_u_street.php|website=dcist|publisher=dcist|accessdate=3 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502180546/http://dcist.com/2015/04/the_funk_parade_takes_over_u_street.php|archivedate=2 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-founders of the event are Justin Rood and Chris Naoum, who brought together many city businesses, venues, art and community organizations to create the event.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2014, DC government forced the parade to follow a narrow and crowded route down V Street NW, but the 2015 parade took place on the main fair of U Street.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to founders Rood and Naoum, the parade is meant to bring together all different types of DC community members to celebrate the city's musical history and the historical importance of U Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = D.C. celebrates U Street history during packed Funk Parade|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-celebrates-u-street-history-during-packed-funk-parade/2015/05/02/59e451f0-f0fd-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-05-02|access-date = 2015-05-03|issn = 0190-8286|language = en|first = Perry|last = Stein}}&lt;/ref&gt; DC natives [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Duke Ellington]] are commonly seen as some of the most significant musicians to transform the music culture of U Street, making it the heart of live music in DC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Events==
The 2014 Funk Parade attracted more than 25,000 people.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = U Street funks you up with D.C. Funk Parade|url = http://wtop.com/entertainment/2015/04/u-street-funks-you-up-with-dc-funk-parade/|accessdate = 2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 Funk Parade began at the beginning of 14th and U Streets all the way to the [[Howard Theatre]] at 7th Street and Florida Avenue. The event started off with the Day Fair, showcasing over 50 performing groups and food vendors from 12pm to 5pm. The parade began at 5pm outside the Howard Theatre and showcased local student marching bands including the Duke Ellington Radical Elite Show Band and Batala D.C.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The parade ended at the Lincoln Theatre at 7pm, and was followed by more music performances at venues along U Street. The afterparty, beginning at 10pm, featured music groups Trouble Funk, Lee fields and DJ Nitekrawler.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The 2017 4th Annual Funk Parade was Hosted by David "The Oh!"

'''Féile an Phobail''' (''The Community's Festival''), also known as the '''West Belfast Festival''' is a community arts organisation known for its ''August Féile'' (Festival). The organisation is prominent for its promotion of [[Culture of Ireland|Irish]] and international culture. The festival takes place on and around [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]] in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="20Years"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/tv/programmes/feile/index.shtml BBC Programme – Féile an Phobail] – 20 Years On&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CultureNI01"&gt;[http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=1469 Féile is back] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213233933/http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=1469 |date=13 February 2012 }} – CultureNorthernIreland.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Official06"&gt;[http://www.feilebelfast.com Féile an Phobail] – Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Foundations ===
The festival was established in 1988 as a direct response to [[the Troubles]], and specifically after the events of March 1988. The [[Special Air Service]] [[Operation Flavius|killed]] three [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] members&lt;ref&gt;http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=695820&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Gibraltar]]. At one of the funerals of the three, an [[Ulster loyalist]] paramilitary attacked the funeral with grenades and pistols, killing three mourners (see [[Milltown Cemetery attack]]). At the funeral of one of the mourners, two plainclothes British servicemen were killed when they drove into a funeral procession (see [[Corporals killings]]). The community of west Belfast came under intense media scrutiny and was described by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] as a "terrorist community".&lt;ref name="20Years" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AdamsInterview"&gt;[http://www.irishnews.com/searchlog.asp?reason=denied_empty&amp;script_name=/pageacc.asp&amp;path_info=/pageacc.asp&amp;tser1=ser&amp;par=ben&amp;sid=364337 The Irish News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200507/http://www.irishnews.com/searchlog.asp?reason=denied_empty&amp;script_name=%2Fpageacc.asp&amp;path_info=%2Fpageacc.asp&amp;tser1=ser&amp;par=ben&amp;sid=364337 |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing this portrayal of his community as negative, misleading and damaging, [[Gerry Adams]] gathered a small amount of friends and various local groups to organise a community festival. Its purpose was to celebrate the positive side of the community: its creativity, its energy, its passion for the arts and for sport. The ''Féile'' was, and is, aimed at providing events and entertainment at a price that the majority of the community could afford.&lt;ref name="20Years" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CityRocks12"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4729141.stm City Rocks During Festival] – BBC NI&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1988 the first festival opened with a relatively humble parade of floats and bands and [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] clubs walking in their club regalia to an open-air party in [[Dunville Park]]. Street parties were organised throughout the west of the city. Door-to-door collections were made to fund day trips to the seaside for pensioners and outings for young people.&lt;ref name="CityRocks12" /&gt;

=== Present ===
Féile an Phobail has garnered resounding praise and has grown to one of the largest community festivals in Europe.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/tv/programmes/feile/index.shtml Féile an Phobail: 20 Years On] – [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; The carnival parade routinely brings together over 20,000 participants for a colourful, musical procession with specially-designed floats representing a chosen theme, dancers and children in costume and face-masks.&lt;ref name="Relations54"&gt;[http://www.community-relations.org.uk/services/community-relations-groups/?alpha=F Community Relations Organisation]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has grown from a one-week festival to a year-round programme with many events. It established the first ever children's arts festival in Northern Ireland,&lt;ref name="Inquiry"&gt;[http://archive.niassembly.gov.uk/culture/reports/report1-01r_vol3D.htm Inquiry into Cultural Tourism and the Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218101529/http://archive.niassembly.gov.uk/culture/reports/report1-01r_vol3D.htm |date=18 February 2010 }} – [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Draíocht Children's Arts Festival'', with activities ranging from sports to multi-cultural and educational events through both [[Irish language|Irish]] and English. In 2003, 6,000 children and young people participated in Draíocht events.&lt;ref name="Phoblacht346"&gt;[http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/25358 An Phoblacht – Draíocht]&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival also has its own radio station, [[Féile FM]]. The station initially broadcast across Belfast for two one-month periods in the spring and summer, during which young volunteers were professionally trained in media and management skills for free. In 2007, the radio was successful in securing a full-time licence, and now broadcasts seven days a week, throughout Belfast. Some trainees have gone on to find employment in the local media, including [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]], [[BBC Northern Ireland]] and [[The Irish News|Irish News Online]] in Belfast.&lt;ref name="FeileFM"&gt;[http://www.feilefm.com/about.php Féile FM] – History&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Féile an Phobail launched Belfast's first dedicated comedy festival, ''Laugh at the Bank''.&lt;ref name="NewsSite"&gt;[http://www.feilebelfast.com/newsroom/29-04-2009/laugh-at-the-bank-comedy-festival/ Laugh at the Bank Comedy Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Festivals ===
Féile an Phobail runs numerous festivals throughout the year. Among the festivals are:

* '''[[August Féile]]''' (Féile Lúnasa) – oldest project. Among Europe's largest community festivals, runs in August
* '''[[Féile an Earraigh]]''' – Springtime Irish traditional music festival
* '''Draíocht''' – annual children's festival beginning in mid-October
* '''[[Stand up in the West]]''' – monthly comedy night in Belfast's Western Bar, no longer running
* '''[[Laugh at the Bank]]''' – Belfast's first comedy festival. Launched May 2009

== Performers ==
Féile an Phobail has rostered national and international acts to perform with local musicians, catering for all tastes in dancing and music: from [[Irish traditional music]] to [[world music]] and [[Popular music|pop]]. Notable acts include [[Altan (band)|Altan]], [[Brian Kennedy (singer)|Brian Kennedy]], [[Mary Black]], the [[Afro-Cuban All Stars]], the [[Harlem Gospel Choir]], [[Westlife]] and [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]].

Local poets and writers have read their works on the same podium as renowned authors such as [[Patrick Mc Cabe]], [[Roddy Doyle]] and [[Evelyn Conlon]]. The festival has hosted the works of Ireland's leading playwrights and theatre companies, and has been the launching pad for world premiers, such as [[Frank McGuinness]]'s ''Someone Who'll Watch Over Me'' and [[Marie Jones]]' ''A Night in November'' by [[Dubbeljoint Productions]].

The discussion and debates have included talks by world-class journalists and documentary makers including [[Robert Fisk]] (''[[The Independent]]''), [[Michael Moore]] (Oscar Winner) and have witnessed [[Gregory Campbell (politician)|Gregory Campbell]] ([[Democratic Unionist Party]]) on the same panel as [[Alex Maskey]] ([[Sinn Féin]]) at the annual West Belfast Talks Back.

'''The First and Second International Islamic Unity Conference''' were conferences organized by followers of the [[Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order]] in [[Los Angeles]] (1996) and [[Washington DC]] (1998). &lt;ref name="Western Society"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dressler |first1=Markus |last2=Geaves|first2=Ron |last3=Klinkhammer |first3=Gritt |title=Sufis in Western Society: Global Networking and Locality |publisher=Routledge Sufi Series |date=2013 |orig-year=1st pub. 2009 |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ga9_AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=%22International+Islamic+Unity%22+sufi+los+angeles&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_q-mo_IPVAhUQ0mMKHdGhDikQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22International%20Islamic%20Unity%22%20sufi%20los%20angeles&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-415-85090-2 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufi]] and Sufi-friendly Muslim representatives, Islamic scholars and politicians were invited to the conferences. &lt;ref name="Western Society"/&gt; The conferences exemplified the Haqqani-Naqshbandis' ambitions to establish itself as a major player within the American Muslim scene. &lt;ref name="Western Society"/&gt;  The conference was supported in part by members of royalty, Muslim political and religious leaders from across the world.  &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last=Leonard |first=Karen Isaksen |title=Muslims in the United States: The State of Research |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation |date=2003 |page=154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uyFAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=%22International+Islamic+Unity+Conference%22+cyprus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJroiyhpPVAhWKg1QKHfNFB5UQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22International%20Islamic%20Unity%20Conference%22%20cyprus&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-415-85090-2 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First International Unity Conference==
[[File:International Islamic Unity Conference (Los Angeles, 1996) - 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Speakers at a panel discussion during the 1996 conference in Los Angeles.]]
The Los Angeles conference was from August 2 through the 4th, 1996, some 7,000 attendees and over 125 speakers from around the globe attended a three-day marathon of lectures, parallel workshop sessions, prayer, praise of Muhammad and Islamic social interaction. Officially known as the '''International Islamic Unity Conference''', it started off with a press session on Friday morning and ended with a parade through downtown Los Angeles on Sunday evening. Attendees praised the organizers for an excellent, though intense schedule of speeches by muftis, Islamic scholars, international political leaders, American political figures and an array of interfaith events. 

Chaired by Shaykh Muhammad [[Hisham Kabbani]], the conference was sponsored by [[As-Sunnah Foundation of America]], the Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order and by a number of other charitable and religious organizations.

[[File:International Islamic Unity Conference (Los Angeles, 1996) - 02.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Shaykh Kabbani and Nazim al-Haqqani in prayer with others at the Los Angeles conference.]]
Many felt the conference organization was exemplary, the facilities at the Los Angeles' Westin Bonaventure Hotel excellent and the wide variety of cultural food and Islamic entertainment very apropos for such an international event. The many San Francisco Bay Area attendees were happy to find a number of prominent local Islamic activists featured, as well as those from national ISNA, IQRA, MPAC and other national Islamic organizations well represented. 

The spirit of unity was especially apparent at the "Peace in the Streets" session, where about 20 former gang leaders, along with the popular rap star [[MC Hammer]], took shahada with [[Shaykh Nazim al-Qubrusi]], Grand-mufti of Cyprus and worldwide leader of the Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order. 

Attendees were treated to sessions on politics, importance of schools of thought, purification of the heart, establishing Islamic economic power, educational curriculum initiative and many other subjects, discussed from the main podium as well as in intimate workshops where speakers and attendees were able to express their views. A major event occurred on Saturday night, with the launching of the International Day of the Orphan, which is expected, given the sponsorship of California's Assembly, and endorsement by a number of international organizations, to become a globally sponsored day for recalling the plight of orphans and children in difficulty.

==Second International Unity Conference==
The Second International Unity Conference was held in August of 1998 in Washington D.C.  The second conference was sponsored by the newly-formed [[Islamic Supreme Council of America]] and again chaired by Shaykh Kabbani. &lt;ref name="APTV"&gt; {{cite AV media | people= | date=August 8, 1998 | title=USA: MUSLIM REACTION TO BOMB ATTACKS IN KENYA &amp; TANZANIA | medium=Television production | location=Washington, DC | publisher=APTV}} &lt;/ref&gt; Islamic world unity was the theme of the second conference, however topics related to both domestic and political issues were also on the agenda.&lt;ref name="APTV"/&gt;

'''''Joan of Lorraine''''' is a 1946 play-within-a-play by [[Maxwell Anderson]]. It is about a company of actors who stage a dramatization of the story of [[Joan of Arc]], and the effect that the story has on them. As in the musical ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'', most of the actors in the drama play two or more roles. [[Ingrid Bergman]] was the star of the original production, playing both Joan and Mary Grey, the fictional star actress who portrays her. As the play begins, Mary Grey and the fictional director of the play-within-a-play, Jimmy Masters, are in conflict over how Joan is to be played. The conflict is resolved during the course of the play.

Bergman won a [[Tony Award]] for this performance — one of the [[1st Tony Awards|first such awards]] ever given. Other notable actors who appeared in this production were [[Joseph Wiseman]] and [[Sam Wanamaker]]. 

In 1948, an adaptation of ''Joan of Lorraine'' was filmed in [[Technicolor]] as ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]''. This film also starred Ingrid Bergman, but it did not use the play-within-a-play framework. Instead, it made the story a straightforward account of Joan's life, omitting the fictional acting company altogether. Anderson's dialogue for the story of Joan was not only retained, but, in collaboration with [[Andrew Solt]], expanded with additional scenes involving historical characters who do not appear in the original play. For her performance, Ingrid Bergman was nominated for an [[Academy Award]], but lost out to [[Jane Wyman]] in ''[[Johnny Belinda (1948 film)|Johnny Belinda]]''.

'''John Thompson Ford''' (April 16, 1829 – March 14, 1894) was an [[United States|American]] [[Theatre director|theater manager]] in the nineteenth century. He is most notable for operating [[Ford's Theatre]] at the time of the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination]].&lt;ref name=Toomey&gt;{{cite book |authors=Toomey, Daniel and Sheads, Scott|title=Baltimore During the Civil War|publisher=Toomey Press|location=Linthicum, Md.|year=1997|isbn=0-9612670-7-0|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ford was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], and was the son of Elias and Anna (''née'' Greanor) Ford. His ancestors were early [[Maryland]] settlers and some of them took part in the [[American Revolution]]. For a few years he attended public school in Baltimore and then became a [[clerk (position)|clerk]] in his uncle’s tobacco factory in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Not caring for this work, he became a [[bookseller]].

==The theatre==
Working as a bookseller in Richmond, Ford then wrote a [[farce]] dealing with contemporary life.  The farce was entitled ''Richmond As It Is'', and was produced by a [[minstrel]] company called the Nightingale Serenaders. This farce was fairly successful, and George Kunkel, the owner and manager of the Serenaders, offered Ford a position with the organization. He accepted, and for several seasons traveled as business manager of this company throughout the United States and [[Canada]].

In 1854, Ford assumed control of the [[Holliday Street Theater]], Baltimore, which he managed for twenty-five years.&lt;ref name=Toomey /&gt; Later, he built the [[Ford's Grand Opera House|Grand Opera House]] in that city in 1871.

Ford also was responsible for creating three theaters in [[Washington, D.C.]] He opened his first theatre on Tenth Street in 1861.  After it was destroyed by fire the following year, he rebuilt the structure on the same site and called it [[Ford's Theatre]].

== Political life ==
In 1858, Mr. Ford was elected President of the City Council of [[Baltimore]], and by a force of circumstance was [[acting mayor]] for two years. He also was in the position of City Director, for one term, of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]].

He was a Commissioner of the [[McDonough Fund]] on part of the city, and managed the old Washington theatre for a season.&lt;ref name="New York Clipper 1865-08-15"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&amp;d=NYC18650819.2.3&amp;srpos=23&amp;e=-------en-20--21--txt-txIN-sketch------- |format=PDF |title=Our Dramatic Portrait Gallery : John T. Ford |work=[[New York Clipper]] |publisher=[[New York Clipper]] |date=1865-08-15 |page=147 |accessdate=2018-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Lincoln assassination==
{{main|Abraham Lincoln assassination}}
Ford was the manager of this highly successful theatre at the time of the assassination of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. He was a good friend of Lincoln's assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]], a famous actor.  Ford drew further suspicion upon himself by being in Richmond, Virginia, at the time of the assassination on 14 April 1865.  Until April 2, 1865, Richmond had been the capital of the [[Confederate States of America]] and a center of anti-Lincoln conspiracies.

An order was issued for Ford's arrest and on April 18, he was arrested at his Baltimore home. His brothers James and Harry Clay Ford were thrown into prison along with him. John Ford complained of the effect that his incarceration would have on his business and family, and he offered to help with the investigation, but [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]] made no reply to his two letters. After 39 days, the brothers were finally fully exonerated and set free since there was no evidence of their complicity in the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Harry admitted that on the morning of the 14 April 1865, he was standing outside the theater as Booth (dressed in dapper clothing as usual) walked down 10th Street from the north. Harry told him that the President and [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (who later declined to come) would be in attendance that evening to see ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' and that the President's office had just reserved a box for him. Booth said nothing and walked on towards [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]]. (Chamlee, p. 117)&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater was seized by the government, and Ford was paid $88,000 for it by [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The treatment accorded to him following the assassination made him remain bitter toward the US government for decades.

==Theatres in other cities==
During his career, Ford also managed theaters in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]; [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]; [[Charleston, South Carolina]]; and Richmond. It was at Richmond's Marshall Theatre, then under Ford's management, that in November, 1856, [[Edwin Booth]] first met Mary Devlin (playing Juliet to his Romeo), whom he later married. [[Joseph Jefferson]] was then the stage manager and a member of the company of this theater, as was [[Dion Boucicault]]. Ford also managed a great number of travelling as well as resident companies, which included the greatest stars, and actors of his generation. He had a reputation for being honest and honorable in his numerous business dealings. For instance, during the ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' craze of the late 1870s, he was the only American manager who paid [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] a [[Royalties|royalty]] on the opera.  This action prompted the authors and their manager, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], to allow Ford to produce their next opera in America and to entrust their American business affairs to him; and he leased the [[Fifth Avenue Theatre]] in New York City, for the production of ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' in 1879-1880 and other Carte productions thereafter.

For a period of forty years, Ford was an active and prominent figure in Baltimore's civic life. He was connected with many banking and financial concerns, and his business advice was sought and relied on. He was president of the Union Railroad Company, member of the Board of Directors of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], vice president of the West Baltimore Improvement Association, and trustee of numerous [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] institutions. In 1858, while serving as President of the [[Baltimore City Council|City Council]], he was made acting mayor of the city of Baltimore, and he filled this position with marked ability. His winning and gracious personality won him a host of friends.

==Death==

[[File:JohnTFord.LoudonParkCem.20120612.jpg|thumb|right|Grave monument at [[Loudon Park Cemetery]], Baltimore]]
In early 1894, Ford's health declined, his death at his Baltimore home of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] during a bout of [[influenza]] came suddenly. He left a widow, Edith Branch Andrew Ford, who was the mother of eleven children. Ten of these were still living when he died: Charles, then manager of Ford's Opera House; George, a treasurer; John Jr, an advertising agent; Harry; Mattie, an actor; James, and the unmarried daughters Lizzie, May, Lucy, and Sallie. Two days after his death, a funeral was held at his house and officiated by two clergymen from the Central [[Presbyterian Church]] of Baltimore, and he was buried in [[Loudon Park Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11691932&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5401">The '''Khaibakh massacre''' was a mass execution of the [[Chechen people|Chechen]] civilian population of the ''[[aul]]'' (village) [[Khaibakh]], in the mountainous part of [[Chechnya]], by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces under the [[NKVD]] [[Colonel]] [[Mikhail Gvishiani]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.generals.dk/general/Gvishiani/Mikhail_Maksimovich/Soviet_Union.html|title=Biography of Lieutenant-General Mikhail Maksimovich Gvishiani - (Михаил Максимович Гвишиани) (1901 – 1966), Soviet Union|website=www.generals.dk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Deportation of the Chechens and Ingush|deportations of 1944]].

==Massacre==
The massacre took place on February 27, 1944 during [[Operation Lentil (Caucasus)|Operation Lentil]] (the Soviet mass deportation of Chechens to prison camps in [[Central Asia]]). Russian apologists claim that it was impossible to convoy Chechen deportees to the railway stations in the plains due to a [[snowstorm]], which is why according to them over 700 villagers, including "non-transportable" elderly, women and children, were locked in a stable fortified with dry hay and burned alive; those who broke from burning stable were shot. One of the witnesses assigned to the military unit, interpreter Ziautdin Malsagov, recalls that NKVD commander Gvishiani called the two newborn children in the stable "bandits" before ordering to burn the 704 people alive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chechenpress.org/news/3111-2013-02-21-13-47-45.html&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident, Gveshiani was reportedly congratulated for his success and good work by [[Lavrenty Beria]], who promised him a medal.&lt;ref&gt;Gammer, Moshe. ''Lone Wolf and Bear: Three Centuries of Chechen Defiance of Russian Rule''. London 2006. Page 170. {{ISBN|978-0-8229-5898-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, John. ''Russia Confronts Chechnya: The Roots of a Separatist Conflict''. Page 65. {{ISBN|978-0-521-63619-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==
The ''aul'' of Khaibakh was rediscovered through archaeological finds in [[Ukraine]]. World War II archaeologists found the remains of North Caucasian scouts who died during an operation behind enemy (German) lines. Letters addressed to their relatives were found in their water-resistant pockets, addressed to ''aul'' Khaibach. Stepan Kashurko, one of the archaeologists, accompanied by a former Soviet general, decided to inform the families that the bodies of their relatives were found, but they learned that the settlement no longer existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://informacia.ru/topsecret/news19.htm |script-title=ru:Годовщине депортации народов Северного Кавказа посвящается... |trans-title=Interview with Stephan Kashurko, president of the special 1990 commission investigating the Khaibakh massacre |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614083251/http://informacia.ru/topsecret/news19.htm |archivedate=2008-06-14|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; In continuing their search, they discovered that while the Chechen soldiers were dying at the front, their relatives were burned alive by the Soviet soldiers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Дешериев Ю.

==Assertions of historical falsification==
In a refusal to permit the release of the 2014 film ''[[Ordered to Forget]]'' about the massacre, the [[Ministry of Culture (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Culture]] stated that it had searched three Russian state archives, and that "as a result of the investigation, no documents were discovered proving the fact of the mass burning of residents" from Khaibakh. Finally, the Ministry stated: "This allows us to conclude that claims of this 'event' are a historical falsification."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afp.com/en/news/russia-bans-historically-false-film-stalin-deportations-chechens |title=Russia bans 'historically false' film on Stalin deportations of Chechens |date=27 May 2014 |accessdate=1 June 2014 |website=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |quote=The ministry said it had searched three Russian state archives including the files of the NKVD security forces that carried out the deportations and Stalin's personal files.

The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies lasted from 1815 until 1860, when it was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] to form the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. The capitals of the Two Sicilies were in [[Naples]] and in [[Palermo]]. The kingdom extended over the [[Mezzogiorno]] (the southern part of mainland Italy) and the island of [[Sicily]]. Jordan Lancaster notes that the integration of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies into the Kingdom of Italy changed the status of Naples forever: "Abject poverty meant that, throughout Naples and Southern Italy, thousands decided to leave in search of a better future."

==Name==
The name "Two Sicilies" originated from the partition of the medieval [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. Until 1285, the island of [[Sicily]] and the [[Mezzogiorno]] were constituent parts of the Kingdom of Sicily. As a result of the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers]] (1282–1302),&lt;ref name="dieli"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dieli.net/SicilyPage/History/SicilianHist.html|publisher=Dieli.net|title=Sicilian History|date=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the King of Sicily lost the Island of Sicily (also called Trinacria) to the [[Crown of Aragon]], but remained ruler over the peninsular part of the realm. Although his territory became known unofficially as the [[Kingdom of Naples]], he and his successors never gave up the title "King of Sicily" and still officially referred to their realm as the "Kingdom of Sicily". At the same time, the Aragonese rulers of the Island of Sicily also called their realm the "Kingdom of Sicily". Thus, there were two kingdoms called "Sicily":&lt;ref name="dieli" /&gt; hence, the '''Two Sicilies'''.

==Background==

===Establishment of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies===
The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies resulted from the re-unification of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] with the [[Kingdom of Naples]] (called the Kingdom of Peninsular Sicily), by King [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] in 1442. The two states had functioned as separate realms since the War of the Sicilian Vespers in 1282. At the death of King Alfonso in 1458, the kingdom again became divided between his brother [[John II of Aragon]], who kept the island of Sicily, and his illegitimate son [[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand]], who became King of Naples.

In 1501, King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], son of John II, conquered Naples and reunified the two kingdoms under the authority of the newly united Spanish throne. The Kings of Spain then bore the title ''King of Both Sicilies''&lt;ref name="waller"&gt;Waller, Maureen. ''Sovereign Ladies: The Six Reigning Queens of England''. St. Martin's Press (New York), 2006. {{ISBN|0-312-33801-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''King of Sicily and of the Two Coasts of the Strait'' until the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} At the end of that war, the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 granted Sicily to the [[Duke of Savoy]] until the [[Treaty of Rastatt]] in 1714 left Naples to the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI]]. In 1720 the Emperor and Savoy exchanged Sicily for [[Sardinia]], thus reuniting Naples and Sicily.
[[File:Infante Ferdinand of Parma 1791-S 8 Doppie.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]] (aka Ferdinand III of Sicily and Ferdinand IV of Naples) depicted on a [[Duchy of Parma]], 8 Doppie (1791) gold coin]]
In 1734, [[Charles III of Spain|Charles, Duke of Parma]], son of Philip V of Spain, took the Sicilian crown from the Austrians and became Charles VII &amp; V, giving Parma to his younger brother, Philip. In 1759, Charles became King Carlos III of Spain and resigned Sicily and Naples to his younger son, who became [[Ferdinand III of Sicily]] and Ferdinand IV of Naples, later crowned Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies in 1816.  Apart from an interruption under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies remained under the Bourbon line (''Bourbon Duo-Sicilie'') continually until 1860.

In January 1799, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], in the name of the [[French First Republic|French Republic]], captured Naples and proclaimed the [[Parthenopaean Republic]], a French client state, as successor to the kingdom. [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand]] fled from Naples to Sicily until June of that year.  In 1806, Napoleon, by then French Emperor, again dethroned King Ferdinand and appointed his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]], as King of Naples.  In the Edict of Bayonne of 1808 Napoleon moved Joseph to Spain and appointed their brother-in-law, [[Joachim Murat]], as King of the Two Sicilies, though this only meant control of the mainland portion of the kingdom.&lt;ref name="colletta"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Colletta |first=Pietro |title=History of the Kingdom of Naples (1858)|publisher=University of Michigan |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7IM2AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Edict+of+Bayonne%22|year=1858 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tolentino815.it/paginaeng2949.aspx|publisher=Tolentino815.it |title=The Battle of Tolentino &gt; Joachim Murat |date=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout this Napoleonic interruption, King Ferdinand remained in Sicily, with [[Palermo]] as his capital.

The [[Congress of Vienna]] restored King Ferdinand in 1815. He established a [[concordat]] with the [[Papal States]], which previously had a claim to the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Blanch |first=L |title=Luigi de' Medici come uomo di stato e amministratore |publisher=Archivio Storico per le Province Napoletane |url=http://www.murat.it/Libri/Bibliogafia%20della%20Valente.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several rebellions took place on the island of [[Sicily]] against King [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand II]] (reigned 1830-1859), but the end of the kingdom came only with the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] in 1860, led by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] - an icon of Italian unification - with the support of the [[House of Savoy]] and their [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]]. The expedition resulted in a striking series of defeats for the Sicilian armies facing the growing troops of Garibaldi. After the capture of Palermo and  Sicily, Garibaldi disembarked in [[Calabria]] and moved towards Naples, while in the meantime the Piedmontese also invaded the Kingdom from the [[Marche]]. The last battles took place at [[battle of Volturnus (1860)|Volturnus in 1860]] and at the [[siege of Gaeta (1860)|siege of Gaeta]], where King [[Francesco II of the Two Sicilies|Francis II]] (reigned 1859-1861) had sought shelter, hoping for French help, which never came.  The last towns to resist Garibaldi's expedition, [[Messina]] and [[Civitella del Tronto]], capitulated on 13 March 1861 and on 20 March 1861 respectively. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies dissolved and the new [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], founded in the same year annexed its territory. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The fall of the Sicilian aristocracy in the face of Garibaldi's invasion forms the subject of the novel ''[[The Leopard]]'' by [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa]] and its [[The Leopard (1963 film)|film adaptation]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Origins of the two kingdoms===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Sicily|Kingdom of Naples}}
[[File:Chapelle Palatine.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Cappella Palatina]], church of first unifier [[Roger II of Sicily]].]]
A monarchy over the areas which would later become known as the Two Sicilies existed as one single kingdom, including a [[Italian Peninsula|peninsular]] and an [[Sicily|insular]] part, dating from the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Normans|Norman]] king [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]] formed the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] by combining the [[County of Sicily]] with the southern part of the Italian Peninsula (then known as the [[Duchy of Apulia and Calabria]]) as well as with the [[Maltese Islands]]. The capital of this kingdom was [[Palermo]]&amp;nbsp;— which is on the actual island of [[Sicily]].

The state existed in that form from 1130 until 1285. In the period of the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] during the reign (1266-1285) of King [[Charles I of Naples|Charles I]], the kingdom was split by the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers]] of 1282-1302.&lt;ref name="dieli"/&gt; Charles, who was of French origin, lost Sicily proper to the [[House of Barcelona]], who were [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] and [[Catalan people|Catalan]], after they were able to gain the support of the natives. Charles remained king over the peninsular part of the realm, thereafter informally known as the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. Officially Charles never gave up the title of "The Kingdom of Sicily", thus there existed two separate kingdoms calling themselves "Sicily".&lt;ref name="dieli"/&gt;

===Aragonese and Spanish direct rule===
{{Main article|Crown of Aragon|Spanish Empire}}
[[File:Imperi de la Corona d'Aragó.png|thumb|left|180px|Crown of Aragon, greatest extent]]
Only with the [[Peace of Caltabellotta]] (1302), sponsored by [[Pope Boniface VIII]], did the two kings of "Sicily" recognize each other's legitimacy; the island kingdom then became the "[[Kingdom of Trinacria]]" in official contexts, though the populace still called it Sicily.&lt;ref name="dieli"/&gt; Eventually by 1442 the Angevin line of the [[Kings of Naples]] was coming to an end. [[Alfonso V of Aragon]], king of insular Sicily, conquered Naples and became king of both (1442).

Alfonso V described the geographical area in [[Latin]] as ''Utriusque Siciliæ'', meaning "of both Sicilies", and used the name as part of his title.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date= September 2012}}
After the death of Alfonso in 1458, both Sicilies remained under the direct rule of the [[Crown of Aragon]], but Naples had a different Aragonese king from the island of Sicily from 1458 until 1501. For a brief period Naples was controlled by a different power other than Sicily, in the form of French king [[Louis XII of France]], who took the mainland kingdom and held it (1501-1504) for around three years. After the French lost the [[Battle of Garigliano (1503)|Battle of Garigliano]] (1503), the last Aragonese king, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], re-united the two areas once again under control of the same power and the same king.

From 1516, when [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] became the first [[King of Spain]], both Naples and Sicily came under direct Spanish rule. In 1530 Charles V granted the islands of [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]], which had been part of the Kingdom of Sicily for four centuries, to the [[Knights Hospitaller]] (thereafter known as the [[Order of Malta]]).
The period of direct Spanish rule under the same line of kings lasted until 1713, when control of Spain and of both Sicilies passed to the French prince [[Philip V of Spain|Philip, duke of Anjou]], who founded the Spanish branch of the [[House of Bourbon]].
After an eight-year spell of [[House of Savoy | Savoy]] rule in Sicily (1713-1720), the two Sicilian kingdoms once again came under the same king after the [[Treaty of The Hague (1720)|Treaty of The Hague]] (1720) appointed the [[House of Habsburg|Austrian]] king [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] as their ruler.

==History==

===Unification of the Crowns===
[[File:Ferdinand IV of Naples.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand I]]]]
The kingdoms were conquered from the Austrians by a young Spanish prince during the [[War of the Polish Succession]]; he became [[Charles III of Spain|Charles VII of Naples]]. The two kingdoms were then recognised as both independent and under Charles' rule as a [[cadet branch]] of the Spanish Bourbons by the [[Treaty of Vienna (1738)|Treaty of Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.realcasadiborbone.it/uk/archiviostorico/cs_04.htm |publisher=RealCasaDiBorbone.it |title=Charles of Bourbon – the restorer of the Kingdom of Naples |date=7 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926150113/http://www.realcasadiborbone.it/uk/archiviostorico/cs_04.htm |archivedate=26 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Charles' brother, [[Fernando VI of Spain]] died childless, Charles inherited the Spanish Crown in 1759, reigning as Charles III of Spain.

His son [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand]] then became king of the two kingdoms so as to maintain them as separate realms as required by the treaties restoring the junior Spanish royalty to the southern Italian kingdoms.  Ferdinand was highly popular with the [[Naples Lazzaroni|poorest class]]. Ferdinand's reign was highly eventful.  For a brief period the [[Parthenopaean Republic]] controlled Naples with the support of those who supported the [[French Revolution]]. However, a [[counter-revolutionary]] army of the poorest class retook [[Naples]] in order to restore royal power.&lt;ref name="parth"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Parthenopean_Republic.html |publisher=Faculty.ed.umuc.edu |title=The Parthenopean Republic |date=7 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629185159/http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Parthenopean_Republic.html |archivedate=29 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Murat2.jpg|thumb|left|145px|[[Joachim Murat]]]]

Eight years later, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] conquered the peninsular portion of the kingdom during the [[War of the Third Coalition]] and placed his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] on the throne as king.&lt;ref name="bonap"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/november/neapolitan1815.htm|publisher=Onwar.com|title=Austria Naples – Neapolitan War 1815|date=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferdinand fled to his other kingdom, on the island of Sicily itself. Here the alliance he had previously made with [[George III of the United Kingdom]] and [[British Tory Party|Tory]] Prime Minister the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Earl of Liverpool]] saved him. The British protected Ferdinand and the island of Sicily from Napoleonic conquest with the presence of a powerful [[Royal Navy]] fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.realcasadiborbone.it/uk/archiviostorico/cs_05.htm |publisher=RealCasaDiBorbone.it |title=Ferdinand IV King of Naples and Sicily (Ferdinand I as King of the Two Sicilies) |date=7 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229161058/http://www.realcasadiborbone.it/uk/archiviostorico/cs_05.htm |archivedate=29 December 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back on the mainland, [[Joachim Murat]] had become the second [[Bonapartist]] king. In the ''Edict of Bayonne'' he was named as "King of the Two Sicilies",&lt;ref name="colletta"/&gt; though ''de facto'' he never actually held the island of Sicily where Ferdinand was, and is usually referred to as just the [[King of Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ameliefr.club.fr/E-Murat.html|publisher=Emeliefr.club.fr|title=Joachim Murat, |date=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Murat actually switched sides for a while, abandoning the [[La Grande Armée|Grand Army]] after the disastrous [[Battle of Leipzig]] in an attempt to save his Neapolitan throne. However, as the [[Congress of Vienna]] progressed, tensions arose as there was strong pressure to restore Ferdinand to the Neapolitan kingdom as well as keeping his Sicilian one.&lt;ref name="bonap"/&gt; Murat returned to Napoleon and together they declared war on the [[Austrian Empire]], leading to the [[Neapolitan War]] in March 1815. Ferdinand and his allies Austria, Britain and [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] were victorious, restoring him to his Neapolitan throne. To avoid further French attempts, it was agreed at the [[Congress of Vienna]] that Ferdinand would reunite his kingdom.

When talking about the period from 1816 until 1861, historians refer to the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] together as one state - the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. For the period prior to 1816, instead, historians refer to them separately with their own name, as they were separate kingdoms.

===Invasion by Piedmont===
Between 1816 and 1848, the island of [[Sicily]] experienced three popular revolts against Bourbon rule, including the [[Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848|revolution of independence]] of 1848, when the island was fully independent of Bourbon control for 16 months.

In 1860, Sicily was [[Expedition of the Thousand|invaded]] by a corps of volunteers, led by Giuseppe Garibaldi from the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. They successfully conquered the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and incorporated the territory into the new [[Kingdom of Italy]].

===Industry===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Industry was the highest form of income if compared with the other preunitarian states. One of the most important industrial complexes in the kingdom was the [[Shipyard]] of [[Castellammare di Stabia]], which employed 1800 workers. The engineering factory of [[Pietrarsa]], was the largest industrial plant in the Italian peninsula producing tools, [[cannon]]s, rails, [[locomotive]]s. The complex also included a school for train drivers, and naval engineers and thanks to this school, the kingdom was able to replace the English personnel which was necessary until then. The first [[steamboat]] with screw propulsion known in the Mediterranean Sea is the "Giglio delle Onde", with mail delivery and passenger transport purposes after 1847.

In Calabria were located the Fonderia Ferdinandea was a large [[foundry]] where cast iron was produced. The [[Reali ferriere ed Officine di Mongiana]] was an iron foundry and [[weapon]]s factory. Founded in 1770, it employed 1600 workers in 1860 and closed in 1880.  In Sicily (near [[Catania]] and [[Agrigento]]), [[sulphur]] was mined for [[gunpowder]]. The Sicilian mines were able to satisfy most of the global demand for sulfur. [[Silk]] cloth production was focused in [[San Leucio]] (near [[Caserta]]). The region of [[Basilicata]] also had several mills in [[Potenza]] and [[San Chirico Raparo]], where [[cotton]], [[wool]] and silk were processed.  [[food industry|Food processing]] was widespread, especially near [[Naples]] ([[Torre Annunziata]] and [[Gragnano]]). Almost 99% of the industries present in the Kingdom were destroyed and relocated to the north by the occupying forces of the [[house of Savoy]] after the unification.

===Transport===

With all of its major cities boasting successful ports, transport and trade in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was most efficiently conducted by sea. The Kingdom possessed the largest merchant fleet in the Mediterranean. Urban road conditions were to the best European standards, by 1839, the main streets of Naples were gas-lit. Efforts were made to tackle the tough mountainous terrain, Ferdinand II built the cliff-top road along the Sorrentine peninsula. Road conditions in the interior and hinterland areas of the kingdom made internal trade difficult. The first railways and iron-suspension bridges in Italy were developed in the south, as was the first overland electric telegraph cable.

===Technological and scientific achievements===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
The kingdom achieved several scientific and technological accomplishments, such as the first steamboat in the Mediterrean Sea (1818), built in the shipyard of Stanislao Filosa al ponte di Vigliena, near Naples, and the first railway in the Italian peninsula (1839), which connected Naples to Portici. However, until the Italian unification, the [[railway]] development was highly limited. In the year 1859, the kingdom had only 99 kilometers of rails, compared to the 800 kilometers of [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia|Piedmont]]. This was because the kingdom could count on a very large and efficient merchant navy, which was able to compensate for the need for railways. Also, southern landscape was mainly mountainous making the process of building railways  quite difficult, as building railway tunnels was much harder at the time. However, the first [[railway tunnel]] in the world was built there. Among the other achievements, one worth mentioning is the first [[suspension bridge]] in Continental Europe (1832), the first [[gas lighting|gaslight]] in Italy (1839), the first volcano observatory in the world, [[Vesuvius Observatory|l'Osservatorio Vesuviano]] (1841), the first and actual [[archaeological excavation]]s in the world (in the ancient cities of [[Pompei]] and [[Ercolano]]), the first faculty of [[Economics]] in Europe and the first faculty of [[Astronomy]] in Italy. The first suspension bridge, built in iron, the "[[Bridge Real Ferdinando sul Garigliano|Real Ferdinando]]" on the river [[Garigliano]] and it was built in the Reali Ferriere factory and Weapons factory in [[Mongiana]]. The rails for the first Italian railways were built in Mongiana as well. All the rails of the old railways that went from the south to as far as [[Bologna]] were built in Mongiana. Naples was the most populated city in Italy, and the third most populated city in Europe. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Heads of the Royal House of the Two Sicilies, 1861–present==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
{{Two Sicilies Royal Family}}
* 1861–1894: [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies|Francis II]]
* 1894–1934: [[Prince Alfonso, Count of Caserta]]
* 1934–1960: [[Prince Ferdinando Pius, Duke of Calabria|Prince Ferdinando Pius]], Duke of Noto, later, Duke of Calabria
* 1960–1964: Disputed between [[Infante Alfonso, Duke of Calabria]] and [[Prince Ranieri, Duke of Castro]]
* 1964–1966: Disputed between [[Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria]] and [[Prince Ranieri, Duke of Castro]]
* 1966–2008: Disputed between [[Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria]] and [[Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Castro]]
* 2008–2015: Disputed between [[Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria]] and [[Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro]]
* 2015–''present'': Disputed between [[Prince Pedro, Duke of Calabria]] and [[Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro]]

Upon Ferdinando Pio's death in 1960, there was a dispute about who inherited the headship of the house. Ferdinando's next brother [[Carlos, Prince of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Carlo]] had, in anticipation of his marriage to [[Mercedes, Princess of Asturias|the eldest sister]] and [[heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]] of King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]], signed the so-called ''Act of Cannes'' on 14 December 1900:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...Here present is His Royal Highness Prince Don Carlo our dearest loved Son and he has declared that he shall be entering into marriage with Her Royal Highness the Infanta Doña Maria Mercedes, Princess of the Asturias, and assuming by that marriage the nationality and quality of Spanish Prince, intends to renounce, and by this present act solemnly renounces for Himself and for his Heirs and Successors to any right and rights to the eventual succession to the Crown of the Two Sicilies and to all the Properties of the Royal House found in Italy and elsewhere and this according to our laws, constitutions and customs of the Family and in execution of the Pragmatic Decree of King Charles III, Our August ancestor, of the 6th October 1759, to whose prescriptions he declares freely and explicitly to subscribe to and obey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chivalricorders.org/royalty/bourbon/twosicilies/success.htm|title=ChivalricOrders.org|accessdate=13 June 2015|author=[[Guy Stair Sainty|Sainty, Guy Stair]]|work=The Two Sicilies Succession|publisher=Guy Stair Sainty|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206220112/http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/bourbon/twosicilies/success.htm|archivedate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The laws of the deposed Sicilian dynasty and the Pragmatic Decree of Charles III, issued by him as King of Spain and the Two Sicilies on 6 October 1759, required a renunciation only if the Crown of Spain (or the heir apparent thereto) and the "Italian sovereignties" were united in the same person, and in no other circumstances. This could only have happened in 1900 if the Count of Caserta, his oldest son Ferdinand, and King Alfonso XIII had all died, thereby leaving Prince Carlo as heir to the Two Sicilies crown and his wife as Queen of Spain, and if the Two Sicilies crown had been restored. It is claimed that theories advanced to suggest that the 1900 renunciation were in some way unnecessary have been formulated long after the fact, {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}, but by 1907 a son (the first of four, along with two daughters) had been born to Alfonso XIII and Queen Victoria Eugenia and Prince Carlos's older brother Ferdinand had also had a son, Roggero, Duke of Noto, so it soon became irrelevant.

===Calabria line===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Prince Carlo's son, Infante  Alfonso, became the senior male of the house on the death of his uncle, Ferdinando Pio, Duke of Calabria, in 1960 and was proclaimed Head of the Royal House of the Two Sicilies, with the recognition of the Heads of the royal houses of Spain, Parma and Portugal, and the senior line (Bourbon) pretender to the throne of France. Prince Carlo and his descendants continued to be included as Princes of the Two Sicilies in the [[Almanach de Gotha]] from 1901–44, and in the [[Libro d'Oro]] of the Italian Nobility from the first edition in 1907 until 1964, at which time the editor came out in support of the [[cadet line]] claimant. Infante Don Alfonso took the title of Duke of Calabria, considering that the title of Duke of Castro (a Farnese inheritance) had been lost with the sale of the last portions of the duchy to the Italian government in 1941 (a sale from which Prince Carlo received his portion of the proceeds, along with his brothers and sisters, although if the alleged renunciation of 1900 had been valid he would not have been entitled to do so). Carlo married as his second wife, in 1907, Princess Louise of Orléans, and by her had a son (Carlos, killed in the [[Spanish Civil War]]) and three daughters (of whom Princess Maria Mercedes married [[Juan, Count of Barcelona]] and was the mother of King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], and Princess Esperanza married [[Prince Pedro Gastão of Orléans-Braganza]]). The descent in the senior line is as follows:

* 1960–1964: [[Infante Alfonso, Duke of Calabria|Alfonso, Duke of Calabria]], Infante of Spain (married in 1936 to [[Princess Alicia of Bourbon-Parma]], born 1917, daughter of [[Elias, Duke of Parma]])
* 1964–2015: [[Infante Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Duke of Calabria|Carlos, Duke of Calabria]], Infante of Spain since 1994 (married in 1965 to [[Anne, Duchess of Calabria|Princess Anne of Orléans]], daughter of the late Count and Countess of Paris)
* 2015–: [[Prince Pedro, Duke of Calabria|Pedro, Duke of Calabria]], (married to D. Sofia de Landaluce y Melgarejo, a descendant through her mother of the Dukes of San Fernando de Quiroga).
The latter's immediate heir is Jaime, Duke of Noto.

===Castro line===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
The rest of the Bourbon-Two Sicilies family rejected Alfonso's claims, however, and recognized Ranieri, the next surviving brother of Ferdinando Pius, as head of the house. Ranieri took the style of "Duke of Castro" as his title of pretence. The representatives of the junior branch are as follows:

* 1960–1973: [[Prince Ranieri, Duke of Castro]] (died 1973), married to [[Countess Maria Carolina Zamoyska]] (whose mother was a [[Princess of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]]).
* 1973–2008: [[Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Castro]], who had one son and two daughters by his wife Mlle [[Chantal de Chevron-Villette]], including [[Princess Béatrice of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Princess Béatrice]], the former wife of Prince [[Charles Napoléon]].
*2008–present: [[Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro]] married to Ms. [[Princess Camilla, Duchess of Castro|Camilla Crociani]]

They also claim the office of the Grand Master of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11929">{{nihongo|'''Shiori Ino'''|猪野 詩織|Ino Shiori|May 18, 1978 - October 26, 1999}} was a [[Japan]]ese female university student who was murdered on October 26, 1999, at age 21, following months of [[stalking]]. The murder exposed significant dereliction of duties on the part of the police force in [[Saitama Prefecture]], brought about changes to legal treatment of stalking and is known as an example of [[media manipulation]].

==Stalking==
In January 1999, Shiori Ino met {{nihongo|Kazuhito Komatsu|小松 和人|Komatsu Kazuhito}}, a 26-year-old who operated a series of [[massage parlor]]s with his brother Takeshi, a firefighter. Komatsu claimed to be a 23-year-old entrepreneur who dealt in cars, real estate and precious metals. After four or five dates, Komatsu began presenting Ino with expensive gifts such as [[Louis Vuitton]] handbags and [[Gucci]] suits in public places, and screamed abuse at her when she refused them. He also began calling her at home, despite the fact that she had only given him her cell phone number. When Ino attempted to break off contact, Komatsu threatened her until she agreed to keep seeing him. On March 24, Ino confided in a friend that she was afraid for her life. On March 30, she wrote a [[will and testament|will]], and attempted again to break off the relationship. She relented after Komatsu threatened her family, including insinuations about physically harming her younger brother, a primary school student.

On June 14, Ino met Komatsu at a cafe and unequivocally stated her intention not to see him again. The same day, Komatsu, Takeshi and their friend came to the Ino family home, and threatened both Ino and her mother, presenting them with a series of lies about Ino being liable for fictional [[embezzlement]]s that Komatsu had committed. They threatened Ino's father when he returned from work, who, unmoved, ordered them out of the house after telling them to take the gifts Komatsu had forced on Ino. The three retreated, specifically stating that they did not want the gifts back. Unbeknownst to them, Ino had made an audio recording of the entire ordeal, which she presented to the [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]] police the next day. Despite the outrage of one younger officer, the officers who met Ino told her that she had no case. That day, the Ino family received a call from someone calling himself "Tanaka" demanding the return of the gifts, following a series of about twenty silent calls. This daily barrage of silent calls continued until October 26.

On June 16, Ino again went to the Saitama police with her parents. The police again refused to take action, and suggested that she was at fault for breaking up with a smitten suitor after accepting expensive gifts. They also went to a free legal clinic run by the Chamber of Commerce as per suggestion of the police. After a fifteen minute consultation, the lawyer dismissed their concerns, stating that, "But she had a lot of things bought for her, right?" The following day, Ino received a call from Komatsu demanding they get back together. She refused, and stated that she had been to the police. Komatsu reacted angrily before hanging up abruptly.

On June 21, Ino sent everything Komatsu had forced on her to his address by courier service. The following day, June 22, Takeshi approached 33-year-old Yoshifumi Kubota, a former manager of one of their massage parlors, with a [[yen|¥]]20 million [[contract killing|murder-for-hire]] scheme at Komatsu's behest. Kubota agreed, and in turn recruited two acquaintances, Akira Kawakami and Yoshitaka Ito. Komatsu departed for [[Okinawa]] on July 5 to build an [[alibi]].

Over the next four months, Ino's family endured an escalating series of harassments and threats, including hundreds of posters and letters slandering Ino and her father distributed throughout the neighborhood, and to the father's workplace. The family repeatedly went to the police armed with the letters, photos of license plates and other evidence, without any action being taken. They pressed [[libel]] charges, only to be actively obstructed by senior precinct police officers who were worried that having unresolved open cases would hurt their standing. In the meantime, Kubota, Kawakami and Ito, armed with Ino's photo, watched her residence and the local train station to plan the killing.

== The murder ==
On October 26, 1999, Ino left her home on a bicycle, heading for [[Okegawa Station]] to attend afternoon classes at her college. Ito, watching from a nearby car, alerted Kawakami, who drove to the station and dropped off Kubota. Kubota walked up to Ino as she got off her bicycle and stabbed her once in the side. As she turned, he stabbed her again in the heart. Ino was pronounced dead at Ageo Central General Hospital.

Immediately following the murder, the Saitama police began a campaign of disinformation, falsely portrating the victim as a promiscuous flirt with a taste for expensive brand-name goods. The [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]]s, then the mainstream press, quickly jumped on the bandwagon, manufacturing lurid stories about Ino working as an [[call girl|escort]]. The Komatsu brothers and their accomplices were not arrested until a journalist, Kiyoshi Shimizu, investigated the case for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Channel Surf |title=Romantics, reporter go far away, so close |publisher=''[[The Japan Times]]'' |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20021027cs.html |date=2002-10-27 |accessdate=2008-01-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630162443/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20021027cs.html |archivedate=2008-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His report, published in the magazine ''FOCUS'', laid bare Ino's long ordeal, and included a photograph of her stalker.

On December 19, 1999, Kubota was arrested. On December 20, 1999, Takeshi, Kawakami and Ito were also arrested. On January 16, 2000, eight other people were arrested for assisting with the harassment, and a warrant was issued for Komatsu, who evaded arrest and went to [[Sapporo]], [[Hokkaido]], where he was tracked by reporter Shimizu. On January 27, 2000, Komatsu's body was found in a lake in [[Teshikaga, Hokkaido]]. His death was found to be a suicide, with a note in his hotel luggage indicating that he had planned to kill himself soon after he had arranged Ino's murder.

==Aftermath==
A legislative hearing was convened into the police handling of the Ino case, and the Saitama police were criticized in the media for [[dereliction of duty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20060516b9.html |title=Crime reporting turns murky as cops clam up |publisher=''[[The Japan Times]]'' |author=Arikawa, Motoi |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2008-02-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125128/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20060516b9.html |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the police force formally apologized to the Ino family. Following an investigation, six officers were disciplined and three senior police officers were fired and [[indictment|indicted]] on a documents falsification charge over their refusal to process the charges brought by Ino during the harassment campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=3 Saitama police officers dismissed over falsification | publisher=CNET Networks | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_2000_April_10/ai_61825358 | date=2000-04-10 | accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 7, 2000, Toshio Katagiri and Hirokazu Furuta were each sentenced to a year and a half in prison, while Tsuyoshi Honda was sentenced to one year, two months in prison. However, they were allowed to receive [[suspended sentence]]s. On December 22, 2000, Ino's family sued the Saitama police. On February 16, 2003, district court ruled that the police would have to pay consolation money, but denied that police neglect had allowed Ino's murder. On appeal, on August 30, 2006, the [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]] upheld the original sentence.

A stalker regulation law took effect in November 2000 as a result of Ino's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20051221a4.html |title=Stalker-killer's life term upheld |work=''[[The Japan Times]]'' |date=December 21, 2005 |accessdate=September 16, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630162447/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20051221a4.html |archivedate=June 30, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Shimizu received the [[Editors' Choice Magazine Journalism Award]] and the National Association of Commercial Broadcasters in Japan Reporting Award for his coverage of the Ino case. He would later receive the same awards again after getting an innocent man cleared of charges in the [[Ashikaga murder case]] (part of the [[North Kanto Serial Young Girl Kidnapping and Murder Case]]) and pointed out similarities with how the police and prosecutors handled the Ashikaga and Iizuka cases compared to the Ino case.&lt;ref&gt;『殺人犯はそこにいる: 隠蔽された北関東連続幼女誘拐殺人事件』 新潮社、2013年、{{ISBN|978-4104405022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubota was sentenced to eighteen years in prison. Kawakami and Ito were each sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Takeshi was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], but he appealed. On September 5, 2006, the Supreme Court upheld his original sentence.

==Media==
In Japan, the crime has been dramatized for television twice. One version, based on Shimizu's writing, was aired on October 28, 2002. Another version, in which [[Rina Uchiyama]] played the role of Ino, was aired on December 13, 2003.

'''Museum of the Revolution''' ({{Lang-es|Museo de la Revolución}}) is a museum commemorating the antecedents and events of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]], which took place from approximately 1980 until 1992. The museum is located in [[Perquín]], in the [[Morazán Department]] of [[El Salvador]]. This area was dominated during the war by the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] (FMLN). 

The museum includes an exhibit honoring the FMLN's radio network, [[Radio Venceremos]], as well as the weaponry used during the war years and a downed [[helicopter]] that had carried military leader [[Domingo Monterrosa Barrios|Lt. Colonel Domingo Monterrosa Barrios]], a leader of the [[Atlacatl Battalion]]. An additional outdoor exhibit shows the crater created by a {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} [[United States|U.S.]]-made [[bomb]], together with a disarmed example of such a bomb. Former members of the ''[[guerrilla]]'' staff the exhibits and answer guests' questions.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-163550116.html |first=Reed |last=Johnson |title=From ashes of revolution, rebels build museums |newspaper=Virginian Pilot |others=Reprinted from the [[Los Angeles Times]] |date=13 May 2007 |page=A19 |accessdate=14 June 2014 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{2018 Winter Olympics}}
'''Olympic Athlete from Russia''' ('''OAR''') is the [[International Olympic Committee]]'s (IOC) designation of select Russian athletes permitted to participate in the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang]], [[South Korea]]. The designation was instigated following the suspension of the [[Russian Olympic Committee]] after the [[Doping in Russia|Olympic doping controversy]]. This was the first time since the [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]] of 1992 that Russian athletes had participated under the neutral Olympic flag.

During the 2018 Winter Olympics, two athletes from this team tested positive for banned substances and were found guilty of [[Doping in sport|doping]] by the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS). Both were sanctioned by the IOC and their results were annulled as a consequence of the ruling.

== Background ==
===Russian doping allegations===
{{see|Doping in Russia|McLaren Report}}
In December 2014, German public broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] aired a documentary which made wide-ranging allegations that Russia organized a state-run [[Doping in Russia|doping program]] which supplied their athletes with [[performance-enhancing drugs]].&lt;ref name=Guard3Dec&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olterman|first1=Philip|title=Russia accused of athletics doping cover-up on German TV|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/03/russia-accused-athletics-doping-cover-up-olympics|accessdate=9 November 2015|work=The Guardian|date=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) published a report and the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/world-anti-doping-program/independent-commission-report-1|title=Independent Commission Report #1|publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published allegations by the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, Dr. [[Grigory Rodchenkov]], that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games. Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a [[cover-up]], and that a third of the Russian medals won at Sochi were the result of doping.&lt;ref&gt;

According to the [[McLaren Report]], the Disappearing Positive Methodology operated from "at least late 2011 to August 2015".

On 9 December 2016, Canadian lawyer [[Richard McLaren (academic)|Richard McLaren]] published the second part of his [[McLaren Report|independent report]]. The investigation found that from 2011 to 2015, more than 1,000 Russian competitors in various sports (including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports) benefited from the cover-up.&lt;ref name=NYT161209/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian161209/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/doping-control-process/mclaren-independent-investigation-report-part-ii|title=MCLAREN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION REPORT - PART II|publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency|date= 9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the release of the McLaren report, the IOC announced the initiation of an investigation of 28 Russian athletes at the Sochi Olympic Games. ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' reported the names of 17 athletes, of whom 15 are among the 28 under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;

====Official sanctions====
[[File:Olympic Athlete from Russia logo 2018.svg|thumb|right|175px|Approved OAR logo]]
On 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the Russian Olympic Committee had been suspended from the 2018 Winter Olympics with immediate effect. Athletes who had no previous drug violations and a consistent history of drug testing were to be allowed to compete under the [[Olympic Flag]] as an "Olympic Athlete from Russia" (OAR).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Under the terms of the decree, Russian government officials were barred from the Games, and neither the country's flag nor anthem would be present (the Olympic Flag and [[Olympic Anthem]] would be used instead).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite press release|title=IOC suspends Russian NOC and creates a path for clean individual athletes to compete in Pyeongchang 2018 under the Olympic Flag|date=5 December 2017|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-suspends-russian-noc-and-creates-a-path-for-clean-individual-athletes-to-compete-in-pyeongchang-2018-under-the-olympic-flag|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 December 2017 the IOC proposed an alternative logo for the OAR athletes' uniforms (shown on right).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-s-olympic-athlete-from-russia-implementation-group-releases-guidelines-for-uniforms-accessories-and-equipment|title=IOC's OAR implementation group releases guidelines for uniforms accessories and equipment's|date=20 December 2017|work=olympic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOC President [[Thomas Bach]] said that "after following due process [the IOC] has issued proportional sanctions for this systematic manipulation while protecting the clean athletes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/ioc-bars-russian-athletes-and-officials-from-winter-olympic-games-59818 | title=IOC Bars Russian Athletes and Officials From Winter Olympic Games | work=The Moscow Times | date=5 December 2017 | accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of January 2018, the IOC had sanctioned 43 Russian athletes from the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] and banned them from competing in the 2018 edition and all other future Olympic Games as part of the [[Oswald Commission]]. All but one of these athletes appealed against their bans to CAS. The court overturned the sanctions on 28 athletes, meaning that their Sochi medals and results were reinstated, but decided that there was sufficient evidence against eleven of the athletes to uphold their Sochi sanctions. The IOC said in a statement that "the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation" and that "this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping". The IOC were careful to note that the CAS Secretary General "insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent" and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. The court also decided that none of the 39 athletes should be banned from all future Olympic Games, but only the 2018 Games. Three of the 42 Russian athletes that originally appealed are still waiting for their hearing, which will be conducted after the 2018 Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-statement-on-cas-decision|title=IOC Statement on CAS Decision|date=1 February 2018|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An original pool of 500 Russian athletes was put forward for consideration for the 2018 Games and 111 were immediately removed from consideration. The remaining athletes had to meet pre-games conditions such as further pre-games tests and reanalysis from stored samples. Only if these requirements were met would the athletes be considered for invitation to the Games. None of the athletes who had been sanctioned by the Oswald Commission were still in the pool at this stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/reduced-pool-of-russian-athletes-and-officials-who-can-be-considered-for-invitation-to-pyeongchang-2018-determined|title=Reduced Pool of Russian Athletes and Officials Who Can Be Considered for Invitation to PyeongChang 2018 Determined|date=25 January 2018|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The final number of neutral Russian athletes invited to compete was 169&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/sports/olympics/russia-doping.html|title=Russia Is Barred From Winter Olympics. Russia Is Sending 169 Athletes to Winter Olympics|date=25 January 2018|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, after speed skater [[Olga Graf]] dropped out, the eventual total was 168.

In the past, the [[President of Russia|Russian president]] [[Vladimir Putin]] and other officials had stated that it would be an embarrassment for Russia if its athletes were not allowed to compete under the Russian flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=19 October 2017 |title=Putin says US pressured IOC to ban Russia from Winter Games |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/putin-says-us-pressured-ioc-ban-russia-winter-175151912--oly.html |work=[[Yahoo Sports]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |access-date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his spokesman later revealed that no boycott had actually been discussed prior to the IOC's decision.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ruiz |first1=Rebecca C. |last2=Panja |first2=Tariq |date=5 December 2017 |title=Russia Banned From Winter Olympics by I.O.C. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/sports/olympics/ioc-russia-winter-olympics.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the announcement, [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], the [[Head of the Chechen Republic|head of Chechnya]], announced that none of the [[Chechens|Chechen]] athletes would be permitted to participate under a neutral flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.championat.com/other/news-2972433-kadyrov-ni-odin-chechenskij-sportsmen-ne-budet-vystupat-pod-nejtralnym-flagom.html|title=Кадыров: ни один чеченский спортсмен не будет выступать под нейтральным флагом|trans-title=|website=Championat.com|access-date=6 December 2017 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December, Putin stated that his government were prepared to allow Russian athletes to compete at the Games as individuals, but there were still calls from other Russian politicians for a boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.interfax.ru/sport/590596 |title=Жириновский предложил отказаться от участия в Олимпиаде-2018 |trans-title= |publisher=Interfax.ru |date= |access-date=6 December 2017 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/06/sport/russia-doping-2018-winter-olympics-vladimir-putin-pyeongchang/index.html|title=Vladimir Putin won't tell Russian athletes to boycott Winter Olympics|date=6 December 2017|publisher=CNN|access-date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gennady Zyuganov]], leader of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]], proposed to send fans to the Games with a Soviet [[Victory Banner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mk.ru/politics/2018/01/30/zyuganov-predlozhil-otpravit-na-olimpiadu-bolelshhikov-so-znamenem-pobedy.html|title=Зюганов предложил отправить на Олимпиаду болельщиков со знаменем Победы|trans-title= |date=30 January 2018|work=mk.ru|access-date=5 February 2018|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergey Lavrov]], the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs]], suggested that the United States "fears honest competition";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tass.com/politics/985069|title=US fears honest competition in energy, arms industry and sports, Lavrov warns|date=15 January 2018|publisher=[[TASS]]|access-date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Vladimir Putin was of the opinion that the United States had used its influence within the IOC to "orchestrate the doping scandal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41934604|title=Putin: Doping allegations 'US plot against Russian election'|date=9 November 2017|work=bbc.com|access-date=18 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the IOC decision an unfair "collective punishment", saying "It all looks like an absolutely orchestrated and politically motivated decision.

The popular Russian newspaper ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' reported that 86% of Russians opposed participating in the Olympics under a neutral flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spb.kp.ru/daily/26772/3805611/|title=Опрос "КП": Стоит ли спортсменам из России ехать на Олимпиаду под нейтральным флагом|trans-title= |date=20 December 2017|work=kp.ru|access-date=4 February 2018|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the OAR designation, many Russian fans still attended the Games, wearing the Russian colours and chanting "Россия!" ("Russia!") in unison, in an act of defiance against the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/winter-olympics-2018/russian-fans-spurn-stupid-ban-athletes-olympic-games-n847886 | title=Russian fans spurn ‘stupid’ ban on athletes at Olympic Games | publisher=NBC News | first=Eirk | last=Ortiz | date= 14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the games, Russian figure skater [[Evgenia Medvedeva]] revealed in an [[Instagram]] post that the Russian tricolor was hidden on the OAR medal ceremony uniforms underneath a white fur scarf buttoned on the front of the jacket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/sport/420503-evgenia-medvedeva-white-scarf-russian-flag/|title=Little white lie: Skater Medvedeva reveals Russian flag was hidden on OAR kit|work=RT News|date=5 March 2018|access-date=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism====
The [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] voiced support for allowing the full participation of "all clean Russian athletes" in the 2018 Winter Games,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://olympics.nbcsports.com/2017/11/28/russia-hockey-olympics-pyeongchang-iihf/ Ice hockey federation against blanket Russia Olympic ban]". NBC Sports. November 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; calling on the IOC to refrain from imposing "collective punishment".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/iihf-expresses-gowing-concern-russias-olympic-hockey-status/ IIHF expresses growing concern over Russia’s Olympic hockey status]". Sportsnet.ca. November 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC's decision was heavily criticized by Jack Robertson, who was primary investigator of the Russian doping program on behalf of WADA. Robertson argued that the IOC had issued "a non-punitive punishment meant to save face while protecting the [IOC's] and Russia's commercial and political interests". He also highlighted the fact that Russian [[whistleblower]]s proved beyond doubt that "99 percent of [their] national-level teammates were doping". According to Robertson, "[WADA] has discovered that when a Russian athlete [reaches] the national level, he or she [has] no choice in the matter: [it is] either dope, or you're done". He added "There is currently no intelligence I have seen or heard about that indicates the state-sponsored doping program has ceased."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nytimes.com/2017/12/27/opinion/2018-winter-olympics-russia.html|title=The 2018 Winter Olympics Are Already Tainted|work=The New York Times|date=27 December 2017|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that Russian officials intensively lobbied US politicians in an apparent attempt to secure Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov's [[extradition]] to Russia (Rodchenkov being the main whistleblower).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1059507/ioc-accused-of-cowardice-for-failing-to-address-russian-retaliation-against-rodchenkov|title=IOC accused of cowardice for failing to address Russian retaliation against Rodchenkov|work=Inside the Games|date=26 December 2017|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAS decision to overturn the life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals was fiercely criticised by Olympic officials, including [[President of the International Olympic Committee|IOC president]] [[Thomas Bach]] who said the decision was "extremely disappointing and surprising". Whistleblower Rodchenkov's lawyer stated that "the CAS decision would allow doped athletes to escape without punishment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-olympics-ioc-chief-bach-disappointed-doping-bans-lifted/29017362.html|title=IOC Chief Disappointed By Court Lifting Doping Ban On Russians|work=rferl.org|date=4 February 2018|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also that "[the CAS decision] provides yet another ill-gotten gain for the corrupt Russian doping system generally, and Putin specifically".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olympics.nbcsports.com/2018/02/01/russia-olympic-doping-bans-lifted/|title=28 Russians have Olympic doping bans lifted|work=nbcsports.com|date=1 February 2018|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failed doping tests==
Curler [[Alexander Krushelnitskiy]] failed his doping test after winning bronze in the mixed doubles curling as he tested positive for [[meldonium]]. This is a drug used for treating heart conditions such as angina, chronic heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular disorders. It has the effect of increasing blood flow and can lead to an improvement in endurance. Meldonium was placed on WADA's list of substances banned from use by athletes two years previously.&lt;ref name=2016list&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/prohibited-list|title=Prohibited List|date=|work=World Anti-Doping Agency|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krushelnitskiy's wife and mixed doubles curling partner [[Anastasia Bryzgalova]] tested negative for meldonium, but they were both forced by the IOC to return their bronze medals since CAS had found Krushelnitskiy guilty of doping.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics/2018/02/22/russian-curler-stripped-of-olympic-bronze-medal-for-doping-violation.html&lt;/ref&gt; He would later announce his decision not to contest the IOC's ruling, but reserved the right to challenge the suspension should the investigation conclude "no fault or negligence".&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/International/russian-curlers-stripped-medal-doping-violation/story?id=53269083&lt;/ref&gt; Norway was subsequently awarded the bronze medal for the mixed doubles curling event.

[[Nadezhda Sergeeva]], a bobsleigh pilot, tested positive for [[trimetazidine]], a drug used for treating angina and which is also included in WADA’s list of banned substances. She placed 12th in the women's competition, but had passed her drug test five days before the first runs were held at the start of the event.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/International/2nd-russian-athlete-fails-doping-test-winter-olympics/story?id=53301854&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed doubles===
{{Main|Curling at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Mixed doubles tournament}}
Russia has qualified a mixed doubles team by earning enough points in the last two [[World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcurling.org/wmdcc2017/mixed-doubles-olympics|title=Olympic mixed doubles places now known for PyeongChang 2018|date=29 April 2017 |website=www.worldcurling.org/ |publisher=[[World Curling Federation]] (WCF) |access-date=28 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no trials as the team was chosen by the Russian Olympic Committee.

The Olympic Athletes from Russia team won the mixed doubles bronze medal game against Norway, but due to a positive testing of [[meldonium]] from [[Alexander Krushelnitskiy]], their bronze medals were stripped and given to Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/22/russian-curler-alexander-krushelnitsky-stripped-of-winter-olympics-medal-after-admitting-doping |title=Russian curler stripped of Winter Olympics medal after admitting doping|date=22 February 2018|website=www.theguardian.com |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Men's tournament===
{{main|Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament|Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Men's qualification}}
[[Russia men's national ice hockey team]] qualified by finishing second in the 2015 [[IIHF World Ranking]].&lt;ref name=icehockey&gt;{{cite news|title= 2018 Winter Olympics|url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/championships/olympics/|accessdate=23 August 2016|publisher=[[IIHF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first Olympics since 1994 that did not feature any active NHL players, the [[Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics#Ice hockey|Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) team]], consisting primarily of [[SKA Saint Petersburg|SKA]] and [[HC CSKA Moscow|CSKA]] players of a Russia-based KHL and [[Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Men's team rosters#Olympic Athletes from Russia|featuring]] ex-NHL all-stars [[Pavel Datsyuk]], [[Ilya Kovalchuk]] and [[Vyacheslav Voynov]] (all SKA), won the gold medal, after a 4–3 overtime victory over the [[Germany men's national ice hockey team|German team]] in the final. In its post-Olympics World Ranking, the [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]] counted this as a result for the Russian team.&lt;ref name="IIHF2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pyeongchang2018.iihf.hockey/men/news/world-ranking-released/|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]|date=25 February 2018|title=World Ranking released}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IIHF considers this victory to be Russia's second gold medal in the Olympics, as they also attributed the 1992 [[Unified Team at the 1992 Winter Olympics#Ice hockey|Unified Team]] gold medal to Russia.&lt;ref name="1992 Olympic Medal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/all-medallists/olympics/men/|title=OLYMPIC ICE HOCKEY TOURNAMENTS, MEN|author=IIHF|publisher=IIHF.com|accessdate=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the IOC does not attribute either of these results to Russia.[https://www.olympic.org/russian-federation]

[[File:Oper am Gänsemarkt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Decoration during a festival in honour of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] of Great Britain]]

The '''Oper am Gänsemarkt''' was a theatre in [[Hamburg]], Germany, built in 1678 after plans of [[Girolamo Sartorio]] at the [[Gänsemarkt]] square. It was the first public opera house to be established in Germany: not a court opera, as in many other towns. Everybody could buy a ticket, like in Venice. Most works were in the German language or translated librettos (from Italian). 

The building was torn down in 1756, but rebuilt in 1765.

==History==
Hamburg was a rich city and hardly affected by the [[Thirty Years' War]]. 

The founding of the Hamburg opera was an initiative of the well-traveled lawyer and alderman Gerhard Schott, who was impressed by Italian opera and [[Johann Adam Reincken]], a local church organist.&lt;ref&gt;Jaacks, G. (1997) Hamburg zu Lust und Nutz. Bürgerliches Musikverständnis zwischen Barock und Aufklärung (1660-1760), p. 81-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haven, K. van der (2008) Achter de schermen van het stadstoneel. Theaterbedrijf en toneelpolemiek in Amsterdam en Hamburg 1675-1750, p. 40, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Theile]], [[Kapellmeister]] of [[Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp]], who lived during the years 1675-1679 and 1684-1689 in exile in the city, organised its first performance. 
For the construction of the stage the Italian engineer and architect [[Girolamo Sartorio]] was attracted by the private company.&lt;ref&gt;Wendt, J.R.M. (2002) Materialien zur Geschichte der frühen Hamburger Oper, p. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Protests and accusations by some Hamburg ministers before and after the opening held on for several years, and is known as the first "Hamburger Theaterstreit".

The opening of the house took place on 2 January 1678 with [[Johann Theile]]'s sacred opera ''Adam und Eva'', succeeded by works of [[Nicolò Minato]] and [[Antonio Sartorio]], [[Johann Wolfgang Franck]] with ''Cara Mustapha'' (1686), [[Agostino Steffani]], [[Carlo Pallavicino]] and [[Johann Sigismund Kusser]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean, W. &amp; J.M. Knapp (1995) Handel's Operas 1694-1726, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of an argument with the management, Kusser organized an opera in the [[refectory]] of the [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Hamburg|local Dom]]. 

In 1695 [[Reinhard Keiser]] took over the post of [[Kapellmeister]] until 1718; from 1703 to 1707 he also held the directorship. In 1703 [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] came from Halle to Hamburg as a cembalist and violin player, and a famous duel took place between Handel and Mattheson, during and after which ''Cleopatra'' was performed. One of the musicians was [[Christoph Graupner]]. In 1705 (?) Handel met with [[Gian Gastone de' Medici]], who invited him to [[Pratolino]].

[[Agostino Steffani]], [[Johann Mattheson]], [[Georg Friedrich Händel]], [[Nicolaus Adam Strungk]], [[Johann Philipp Förtsch]], [[Georg Bronner]], [[Johann Philipp Krieger]], [[Georg Caspar Schürmann]],  and [[Johann Georg Conradi]] composed [[Singspiele]] or [[baroque opera]]'s for the Hamburg opera. There were performances on two or three days a week, and around 90 performances a year. The opera season started in Winter; in Summer and on religious holidays the theatre was closed. Because of the long scene changes each performance took four to six hours and began by afternoon.

In 1722 [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] took over the management of the opera house, which he held until the end of 1738. In 1727 the first German opera "Dafne" (lost) by [[Heinrich Schütz]] was performed. From 1743 till 1750 the building was used by [[Angelo Mingotti]], performing Italian opera's by  [[Johann Adolph Hasse]] and [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx, H.J. &amp; D. Schröder (1995) Die Hamburger Gänsemarkt-Oper, p. 502-507.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] performed his works in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamburgballett.de/d/oper.htm Ein Opernhaus für Hamburg] hamburgballett.de {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1750 the building was sold.

==Second house==
Between 1767 and 1770 [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] was the dramatist in what was called [[Hamburg National Theatre|Deutsches Nationaltheater]].

The '''Opera Comique''' was a 19th-century theatre constructed in [[London Borough of Westminster|Westminster]], [[London]], between [[Wych Street]] and Holywell Street with entrances on the East [[Strand, London|Strand]]. It opened in 1870 and was demolished in 1902, to make way for the construction of the [[Aldwych]] and [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]]. It is perhaps best remembered for hosting several of the early [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas' original runs.

==History==

===Early years===
The Opera Comique opened in 1870, followed shortly by construction of the adjoining [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] in Newcastle Street.  It had a seating capacity of 862.&lt;ref&gt;Wearing, J. P. "The London West End Theatre in the 1890s", ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 29, No. 3 (October 1977), pp. 320-32, The Johns Hopkins University Press ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/3206178 online by subscription to JSTOR])&lt;/ref&gt; The two theatres, both owned by [[Sefton Henry Parry|Sefton Parry]], were built back to back and called the "Rickety Twins", on the site of the former Lyon's Inn, an old [[Inn of Chancery]], previously belonging to the [[Inner Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;'This Inn, never of much importance, had fallen utterly into disrepute before the beginning of [the 19th] century, and become the resort of gamblers and swindlers... [and] was sold about the year 1863’. [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45129 ''The Strand (northern tributaries): Clement's Inn, New Inn, Lyon's Inn etc.''], Old and New London: Volume 3 (1878), pp. 32-35, accessed: 6 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre, built partly underground, had three entrances through long narrow tunnels from three streets (including [[Strand, London|the Strand]]) and was therefore nicknamed the "Theatre Royal, Tunnels".  It was reportedly hastily built and draughty, and its long flight of stairs leading down to the level of the stalls was a dangerous fire hazard. However, it was nicely decorated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/OperaComique.htm Information from the Arthur Lloyd website] accessed 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Parry built the theatre cheaply, hoping "to make handsome profits in compensation when the area was demolished, which was even then in contemplation".&lt;ref&gt;London Encyclopedia, p. 319.

The theatre was opened with a French company led by the veteran actress [[Virginie Déjazet|Pauline Virginie Déjazet]].  This was followed by the Parisian company, [[Comédie-Française]], who made the theatre their base during the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-opcom.html ''The Assault on The Opera Comique''] accessed 6 Dec 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sorctrial.jpg|left|thumb|upright|1878 programme cover]]
The first home-grown production at the theatre was a musical play in 1871, ''Marie'', with music by [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] and a libretto by E. Spencer Mott.  This accompanied an English adaptation of a [[Molière]] work, called ''The Doctor in Spite of Himself'', which was a failure.&lt;ref name=Ainger92&gt;Ainger, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Original Correspondence", ''The Era'', 10 September 1871&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre then turned to presenting French works in translation; however, the public did not approve of its French name and repertoire, and the theatre was not popular. In 1873, Italian tragedienne [[Adelaide Ristori]] appeared there.  In 1874, Carte's light opera company presented ''The Broken Branch'', an English version of [[Gaston Serpette]]'s ''La branch cassée'', starring [[Pauline Rita]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Graphic'', 29 August 1874, p. 211; also ''The [[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', 29 August 1874, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, Rita starred in the title role, Clairette Angot, in a revival of Lecocq's ''[[La fille de Madame Angot]]'' at the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Fitz-Gerald, S. J. Adair. [https://archive.org/details/storyofthesavoyo009133mbp ''The Story of the Savoy Opera''], p. 12, D. Appleton and Company (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gilbert and Sullivan===
In November 1877, the Comedy Opera Company, managed by Carte, took on the lease and returned to produce the première of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', a proudly English [[comic opera]], at the theatre.  This was followed in 1878 by the same team's patriotic ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', which became a hit, running for 571 performances, the second-longest theatrical run in history, to that date.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in the Theatre'', Fourteenth edition, ed.

W. Bradwell, reopening on 1 February 1879.  The theatrical newspaper, ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' commented, "We can hardly overpraise the beauty and grace of the Opera Comique as it now appears to the delighted audience."&lt;ref name=Renovation&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/pinafore/reviews/era790209.html "Opera Comique"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616045708/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/pinafore/reviews/era790209.html |date=16 June 2010 }}. ''The Era'', 9 February 1879, reprinted at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more Gilbert and Sullivan successes followed, now produced by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]: ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' (1880) and, finally, ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1881), which was later transferred to Carte's new and larger theatre, the [[Savoy Theatre|Savoy]].  During this period, Carte also presented various companion pieces with the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, including the 1877 revival of ''[[Dora's Dream]]'' by [[Arthur Cecil]] and [[Alfred Cellier]]; ''[[The Spectre Knight]]'' (1878); revivals of ''[[Trial by Jury]]''; several pieces by [[George Grossmith]] beginning in 1878: ''Beauties on the Beach'', ''A Silver Wedding'', ''Five Hamlets'', and ''[[Cups and Saucers]]''; revivals of Gilbert's ''[[After All!]]'';&lt;ref name=Renovation/&gt; a ''Children's Pinafore'' with an entirely juvenile cast (1878); ''[[In the Sulks]]'' (1880); and ''[[Uncle Samuel]]'' (1881).

===Later years===
Once D'Oyly Carte left the Opera Comique, the theatre's fortunes declined.  It was unoccupied from October to the end of 1881.&lt;ref name=era&gt;"The Opera Comique Theatre" – a valedictory summary in ''The Era'', 15 October 1898, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  At the start of 1882, [[John Hollingshead]] and Richard Barker presented ''Mother-in-Law'', a frivolous comedy by [[George R. Sims]], which ran in a double bill with a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] called ''Vulcan'' until May.  They were followed by a spoof called ''The Wreck of the Pinafore'' by  H. Lingard and [[Luscombe Searelle]], described by ''The Era'' as "chiefly remarkable for its impudence", which ran until October.&lt;ref name=era/&gt;  During the rest of the 1880s a succession of managements presented a wide range of genres, from adaptations of French plays, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]], [[Ibsen]], a [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] adaptation by the novelist's son, to musical shows, including ''The Fay o' Fire'' by Edward Jones and Henry Herman, which ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' later described as "notable as introducing Miss [[Marie Tempest]] to the regular stage."&lt;ref name=era/&gt;  Composers whose works were presented at the Opera Comique in this period included Julia Woolf, [[Meyer Lutz]] and  [[Victor Roger]].  Performers included [[Nelly Bromley]], [[Frank Wyatt]], [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson]], [[Julia Gwynne]] and [[W. S. Penley]].&lt;ref name=era/&gt;

[[File:Opera-comique-1887.jpg|right|thumb|upright|1887 programme cover]]
The theatre was again renovated in 1885, under the proprietorship of the actor-manager, [[David James (actor, born 1839)|David James]]. ''The Era'' thought that the refurbishments made it "one of the most convenient, handsome, and acceptable places of entertainment in London."&lt;ref name=e1885&gt;"The Opera Comique Theatre", ''The Era'', 4 April 1885, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; James had bought adjoining premises in Holywell Street to make room for an extension to the theatre. The bars and circulation areas were, according to ''The Era'', much improved, a spacious smoking room was added, and new emergency exits were installed.&lt;ref name=e1885/&gt;  In 1891, [[George Edwardes]] took on the management of the theatre and presented a burlesque of ''Joan of Arc'' by [[Adrian Ross]], J. L. Shine and [[Frank Osmond Carr]], with a cast including [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]] and [[Marion Hood]].  It was well received and ran from January to September.&lt;ref name=era/&gt;  After that, the theatre reverted to its pattern of rapidly changing productions and short-lived managements.

A feature of the early 1890s was the frequent presentation of adaptations from, or original works by, novelists such as [[Henry James]], [[Rudyard Kipling]] and [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]].&lt;ref name=era/&gt;  A further season of French plays, performed in their original language, was followed by a German season, also given in the original tongue in 1894, which ran for more than two months.&lt;ref name=era/&gt; In 1895, "[[Nellie Farren]] started her unfortunate season here with a bad comedy … and a worse burlesque".&lt;ref name=era/&gt; [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]'s comic opera ''Shamus O'Brien'' ran for two months from March to May the same year.  Osmond Carr's ''The Maid of Athens'', ran for a month in June 1897, after which, said ''The Era'', "nothing worthy of any record whatever has been attempted at this temple of the drama, which has had a singularly eccentric and mostly disastrous career."&lt;ref name=era/&gt;  A revival of [[Alice in Wonderland (musical)|a musical adaptation]] of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]''&lt;ref&gt;The title role was played by Rose Hersee, aged 12.  See ''The Era'', 28 January 1899, p. 14; it is not known whether she was related to the opera singer [[Rose Hersee]].&lt;/ref&gt; with music by [[Walter Slaughter]], produced by Horace Sedger, opened for the Christmas season of 1898 and ran until mid-February 1899.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Alice in Wonderland (musical)|Alice in Wonderland]]", ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'', 23 December 1898, p.1; and "Tonight's Entertainment's", ''The Pall Mall Gazette,'' 16 February 1899, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1899, Sedger announced a burlesque for the Opera Comique, ''Great Caesar'', by [[Paul Rubens (composer)|Paul]] and Walter Rubens and [[George Grossmith Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 11 March 1899, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; but he changed his plans and presented it at the [[Comedy Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 25 March 1899, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Opera Comique &lt;!--See talk page--&gt;closed in 1899 and was compulsorily purchased by the [[London County Council]] for £40,000.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pall Mall Gazette'', 3 January 1900, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  It was demolished in 1902 when the maze of slums in the area was redeveloped to create [[Aldwych]] (named after old [[Wych Street]]) and [[Kingsway (London)|Kingsway]].&lt;ref&gt;"Our London Correspondence", ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'', 17 October 1902, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parinirvana Day''', or '''Nirvana Day''' is a [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] [[holiday]] celebrated in [[East Asia]].  By some it is celebrated on [[:February 8|8 February]],{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} but by most on the [[:February 15|15 February]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} It celebrates the day when the Buddha is said to have achieved [[Parinirvana]], or complete [[Nirvana]], upon the death of his physical body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/holydays/parinirvana.shtml BBC Holiday Page]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Passages from the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra|Nirvana Sutra]] describing the Buddha's last days of life are often read on Parinirvana Day.  Other observances include meditation and visits to [[Buddhist temple]]s and monasteries.  Also, the day is a time to think about one's own future [[death]] and on the deaths of loved ones.  This thought process reflects the Buddhist teachings on [[impermanence]].

Some Western Buddhist groups also celebrate Parinirvana Day.

The '''''Pequeño Reyes del Aire''''' Tournament ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for the "Little Kings of the Air") is an annual wrestling tournament promoted by the Mexican professional wrestling promotion [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) and has been held since 2007, holding two tournaments in 2012, and one every other year. The tournament includes a varying number of wrestlers, competing in a ''[[Torneo cibernetico]]'' match, essentially a multi-man elimination match with the last competitor remaining is declared that year's ''Pequeño Rey del Aire'' and is given a trophy. The match is based on CMLL's ''[[CMLL Reyes del Aire|Reyes del Aire]]'' tournament which has an identical purpose, format and award. The winner is not normally awarded with a match for the [[CMLL World Mini-Estrella Championship]] or the [[Mexican National Lightweight Championship]], the two Mini-Estrellas championships that CMLL promotes, as a direct result of their tournament victory but has as times been used to build but either a championship match or [[narrative thread|storylines]] between rival wrestlers.

There has been a total of ten tournaments held as of January 2015, with nine different winners, only [[Pequeño Black Warrior]] has won the tournament twice.&lt;ref name=PequenoReyes&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/emll/Pequeño.html | title= Pequeño Reyes del Aire | accessdate= September 29, 2014 | publisher= Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 27 Mini-Estrellas have appeared in the nine tournaments held so far, two wrestlers have appeared in eight of the ''Pequeños Reyes del Aire'', [[Pequeño Olímpico]] and [[Demus 3:16|Pequeño Damián 666 / Demus 3:16]]. Demus 3:16 has the most eliminations, with nine while [[Último Dragoncito]] has eliminated 9 men. Only 4 men have competed without eliminating a single opponent [[Fire (wrestler)|Fire]], [[Mini Maximo]], [[Sombrita]] and [[Stukita]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The statistics are supported by the source for each individual tournament.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mascarita Dorada]] is the youngest tournament winner ever, at 25 years of age when he won the [[#Pequeños Reyes del Aire (2008)|2008 tournament]] while [[Fantasy (Mini-Estrella)|Fantasy]] is the youngest competitor ever, 18 years old when he entered the [[#Pequeños Reyes del Aire (2007)|2007 tournament]]. Pequeño Black Warrior is the oldest tournament winner, he was 42 years old when he won the [[#Pequeños Reyes del Aire 2012 (Guadalajara)|2012 Guadalajara tournament]], while [[Pierrothito]] was 46 years old when he competed in the [[#Pequeños Reyes del Aire (2014)|2014 tournament]] making him the oldest competitor overall.

[[File:Adelaide (long route).svg|thumb|[[Adelaide Street Circuit]]]]
The '''2000 Race of a Thousand Years''' was an [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance race]] and the final round of the [[2000 American Le Mans Series]]. It was run on the [[Adelaide Street Circuit]] in [[Australia]] on [[New Year's Eve]], 31 December 2000. The race was run on the full 3.780&amp;nbsp;km (2.349&amp;nbsp;mi) Grand Prix circuit used by [[Formula One]] for the [[Australian Grand Prix]] between 1985-1995, rather than the shorter 3.219&amp;nbsp;km (2.012&amp;nbsp;mi) [[Supercars]] version of the circuit used since 1999. The Race of a Thousand Years was intended to be run for 1000 kilometres but was stopped short due to time constraints, two hours before midnight, after completing 850 kilometres.

==Background==
Like the [[1999 Le Mans Fuji 1000km|1999 Le Mans Fuji 1000&amp;nbsp;km]], the Race of a Thousand Years was intended as a precursor to a planned Asia-Pacific Le Mans Series (APLMS) run by [[Don Panoz]] and the [[International Motor Sports Association|Professional Sports Car Racing]] body, just as the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] and [[Nürburgring]] events earlier in the season were for the [[2001 European Le Mans Series season|European Le Mans Series]] (ELMS).  After a small amount of entrants for the European series in 2001, as well as a lack of entrants for a third Asian-Pacific exhibition event at the [[Sepang Circuit]], the APLMS plans were cancelled.

The race was the final of twelve [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance]] [[sports car racing]] rounds of the [[2000 American Le Mans Series]] and took place at the [[Adelaide Street Circuit]] on 31 December 2000.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2000/12/12/1211rrr.html#42aa3dc34b23|title=Adelaide: Race Of A Thousand Years|last=Frank|first=Michael|date=14 December 2000|website=[[Forbes]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=no|access-date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was the first in a nine-year contract, but was abandoned after only one. Over 135,000 fans attended the race meeting, with almost 70,000 of them in attendance on race day.

==Race Summary==
By completing the first 25 laps (and in the lead after having passed team mate [[Frank Biela]] on lap 17), [[Allan McNish]] became the [[2000 American Le Mans Series season|2000 American Le Mans Series]] LMP Drivers' Champion. McNish and team mate [[Rinaldo Capello]] completed 225 laps in their [[Joest Racing|Audi Sport North America]] [[Audi R8 (race car)|R8]]. Australian driver [[Brad Jones (racing driver)|Brad Jones]] had also qualified the R8 but did not drive in the race. Jones, the team owner and lead driver of Audi's factory backed [[Super Touring]] [[Brad Jones Racing|team]] in Australia, was on stand-by for [[Scottish people|Scotsman]] McNish who had injured his back a few days before the race while stepping out of his [[kilt]] after a photo shoot and had spent the day before the race flat on his back in bed in a successful effort to be fit to race. The Audi team suffered a setback on the morning of the race when Capello crashed the R8 (painted in crocodile livery in honour of the host country Australia) into the tyre barriers on the outside of turn six. However the team were able to repair the car to allow McNish to start.

The GTS class was won by [[Olivier Beretta]], [[Karl Wendlinger]] and [[Dominique Dupuy]] who piloted their Team [[Oreca]] [[Dodge Viper GTS-R]] (known as a Chrysler Viper in Australia) to 3rd outright, while finishing 5th outright were the GT class winners [[Dirk Müller (racing driver)|Dirk Müller]] and [[Lucas Luhr]] in their Dick Barbour Racing [[Porsche 911 GT3-R]].

McNish (Audi), [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] driver [[Ni Amorim]] (Viper) and [[German People|German]] Luhr (Porsche) set the fastest laps in their respective classes, with McNish's time of 1:25.2189 being the fastest ever non-Formula One race lap of the Adelaide circuit (compared to the outright lap record of 1:15.381 set by [[Damon Hill]] in a [[Williams FW15C]]-[[Renault F1|Renault]] during the [[1993 Australian Grand Prix]]).

'''''Raman Raghav 2.0''''' (released internationally as '''''Psycho Raman''''') is a 2016 Indian [[neo-noir]], [[psychological thriller|psychological-thriller]] film directed by [[Anurag Kashyap]]. Produced by Kashyap, [[Vikramaditya Motwane]], [[Vikas Bahl|Vikas Bahl,]] and [[Madhu Mantena]], the film stars [[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]], [[Vicky Kaushal]], and debutante [[Sobhita Dhulipala]]. It depicts in eight chapters the [[cat and mouse]] chase of serial killer Ramanna (Siddiqui) by corrupt cop Raghavan (Kaushal). Real-life killer [[Raman Raghav]], who operated in Mumbai during the 1960s, inspired the film.

Kashyap initially wanted to make a period film about Raman Raghav, but after the commercial failure of ''[[Bombay Velvet]]'' (2015), his previous film also set in the 1960s, he realised that he would be unable to find financing. Abandoning the period-piece concept, he co-wrote the film with Vasan Bala, setting it in the contemporary time. The film's music was composed by [[Ram Sampath]], and [[Varun Grover]] wrote the lyrics. Jay Oza served as the film's cinematographer and [[Aarti Bajaj]] as its editor.

''Raman Raghav 2.0'' premiered in the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section at the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]]. It also screened at the 2016 [[Sydney Film Festival]], the [[Singapore International Film Festival]], the [[Fantasia International Film Festival]], [[Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival]], and the [[Indian Film Festival of Melbourne]]. The film was released in India on 24 June 2016, received a mostly positive critical response, and proved to be a moderate commercial success, grossing over ₹70&amp;nbsp;million (US$1.1&amp;nbsp;million).

== Plot ==
In 2013 Assistant Commissioner of Police Raghavan Amrendra Singh Umbi, a drug addict, makes a visit to a Mumbai drug dealer. However, his plan to purchase drugs is foiled – the dealer and another man have been murdered. Investigating the murders the next day, he receives a hammer followed by an anonymous phone call.

In 2015 a man named Ramanna surrenders to the police and confesses of killing nine people. He is detained and beaten by the police, but manages to escape with the help of a group of nearby boys. Seeking food at the home of his sister Lakshmi, Ramanna argues with his brother-in-law. After leaving the house he quickly returns and kills the couple and their son. Raghavan is among the police who later investigate the house, where he finds a picture of Ramanna with Lakshmi, confirming Ramanna's involvement in the crime.

Raghavan is in a relationship with Smrutika "Simi" Naidu, but he is an abusive partner: he beats her and has coerced her to have three abortions. Ramanna surveils Raghavan and Simi, suggesting some kind of link exists between the cop and the killer. This surveillance escalates into more murders when Ramanna stalks and kills Simi's maid and her husband. After these killings, Ramanna is caught by the police with assistance from an onlooker. However, Ramanna escapes from custody again and kills the man who aided his capture. Raghavan proves to be a killer himself when, on a trip to visit his father, he murders an African drug dealer.

On a later evening Raghavan picks up another woman named Ankita at a nightclub and brings her to Simi's house. Incapacitated by his drug use, Raghavan is unable to perform sexually, prompting mockery from Ankita. In response he assaults her. Enraged, he searches for the stash of drugs he keeps at the house, but is unable to find it. In this state he confronts Simi and they argue. When Simi demands he leave with Ankita, he strikes Simi; her fall into a glass table kills her instantly.

Ankita locks herself in the bathroom and tries to call for help, but desists when Raghavan threatens and coerces her. He then clears away incriminating evidence and arranges the scene to implicate Ramanna for the murder. He retrieves a tire iron similar to Ramanna's favored murder weapon and smashes Simi's head with it. During these preparations Ankita escapes.

The next day Ramanna surrenders to Raghavan and claims a deep connection with him: each man is the missing half of the other. Ramanna also reveals his role in the two 2013 murders that opened the film and initiated this connection. He confesses to one of the killings, but witnessed Raghavan kill the other man, and thus began his surveillance of the policeman. Ramanna offers to accept the charge for Simi's murder, but only if Raghavan will kill the eyewitness, Ankita. In the final scene Raghavan's descent into evil matches Ramanna's when he murders Ankita in her home.

''Raman Raghav 2.0'' was inspired by the notorious serial killer [[Raman Raghav]], who had killed several homeless people in Mumbai during the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/double-indemnity-whats-common-between-anurag-kashyap-and-sriram-raghavan-2834858/|title=Double Indemnity: What’s common between Anurag Kashyap and Sriram Raghavan?|last=Sahani|first=Alaka|date=6 June 2016|work=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=3 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105122936/http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/double-indemnity-whats-common-between-anurag-kashyap-and-sriram-raghavan-2834858/|archivedate=5 November 2016|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bludgeoning his victims, he produced widespread panic until he was captured by the Mumbai police and confessed to 41 murders.&lt;ref name="psycho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoopwhoop.com/The-Real-Raman-Raghav-Serial-Killer-Anurag-Kashyap/|title=All You Need To Know About Raman Raghav, The Serial Killer Who Inspired Anurag Kashyap's Next|last=Kasotia|first=Yash|work=[[ScoopWhoop]]|date=11 May 2016|accessdate=20 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516153128/http://www.scoopwhoop.com/The-Real-Raman-Raghav-Serial-Killer-Anurag-Kashyap|archivedate=16 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raghav was sentenced to death by the [[Bombay High Court]], but his diagnosis of [[paranoid schizophrenia]] allowed his defence to [[Insanity defense|claim mental incapability]] and gain a change of sentence to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="mind"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/inside-the-mind-of-raman-raghav-mumbai-s-serial-killer-of-the-60s/story-LaA01MtT0wrAM0ZprCoLYJ.html|title=Inside the mind of Raman Raghav, Mumbai's serial killer of the 60s|last=Saxena|first=Poonam|date=14 June 2016|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=3 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927110217/http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/inside-the-mind-of-raman-raghav-mumbai-s-serial-killer-of-the-60s/story-LaA01MtT0wrAM0ZprCoLYJ.html|archivedate=27 September 2017|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psycho" /&gt; He was sent to [[Yerawada Central Jail]], where he died of kidney failure in 1988 after 19 years of incarceration.&lt;ref name=mind /&gt;

Director Anurag Kashyap first became interested in the story of Raman Raghav in 1991, when [[Sriram Raghavan]] was making a 68-minute film about the killer titled ''Raman Raghav, A City, A Killer''. Kashyap was drawn to the idea of a criminal who was not motivated by familiar human vices. According to him, the killer had "no moral compass" or planning to kill someone.&lt;ref name=mind /&gt; He initially wanted to make a trilogy of period films based in Mumbai, the first of which was ''[[Bombay Velvet]]'' (2015), then a film on the [[K. M. Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra|Nanavati murder case]] after ''Raman Raghav 2.0''. But after the commercial failure of ''Bombay Velvet'', Kashyap realised that he would not get producers for another period film. He then set the film in contemporary time.&lt;ref name=mind /&gt; The film on the Nanavati case did not materialise.&lt;ref name=mind /&gt; Vasan Bala, the film's co-writer, had written a biopic about Raman Raghav. Kashyap re-wrote that script, taking inspirations from the actual murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/GIhSzHnmawwpBr4erYfKvN/Anurag-Kashyap-David-Dhawan-of-lowbudget.html|title=Anurag Kashyap: David Dhawan of low-budget films|last=Jhunjhunwala|first=Udita|work=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]]|date=3 June 2016|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107011843/http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/GIhSzHnmawwpBr4erYfKvN/Anurag-Kashyap-David-Dhawan-of-lowbudget.html|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created a police officer who would be the "mirror image" of the killer, as he felt it was difficult to create an honest cop in a contemporary time.&lt;ref name=mind /&gt;

=== Casting ===
[[File:Tire iron.jpg|thumb|right|A [[tire iron]], similar to one used in the film.]]
Kashyap said that [[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]] was his first casting choice for the film because of his "unimposing body". Kashyap modeled the character on [[Raghubir Yadav]], who had portrayed Raman Raghav in Sriram Raghavan's 1991 film.&lt;ref name="mind" /&gt; For the preparation of the role, Siddiqui isolated himself for days, left his house. He mentioned that he started to "fear himself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abplive.in/movies/nawazuddin-left-home-started-fearing-himself-while-preparing-for-raman-raghav-2-0-339285|title=Nawazuddin left home, started fearing himself while preparing for 'Raman Raghav 2.0'|date=10 May 2016|accessdate=10 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518112754/http://www.abplive.in/movies/nawazuddin-left-home-started-fearing-himself-while-preparing-for-raman-raghav-2-0-339285|archivedate=18 May 2016|deadurl=no|publisher=[[ABP News]]|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the positive critical reviews, [[Rajeev Masand]] felt the film "doesn't bring anything blazingly new or original to the serial killer genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rajeevmasand.com/reviews/our-films/going-for-the-kill/|title=Going for the kill|last=Masand|first=Rajeev|publisher=RajeevMasand.com|date=24 June 2016|accessdate=10 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007100911/http://www.rajeevmasand.com/reviews/our-films/going-for-the-kill/|archivedate=7 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shubhra Gupta of ''[[The Indian Express]]'' wrote that the film was "atmospheric yet hollow" and the viewers are "turned into cringing voyeurs, into reluctant participants, without redemption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/raman-raghav-2-0-movie-review-anurag-kashyap-nawazuddin-siddique-2872741/|title=Raman Raghav 2.0 movie review: With few mesmeric bits, Anurag Kashyap’s film is atmospheric yet hollow|last=Gupta|first=Shubhra|work=The Indian Express|date=25 June 2016|accessdate=10 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810070518/http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/raman-raghav-2-0-movie-review-anurag-kashyap-nawazuddin-siddique-2872741/|archivedate=10 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ananya Bhattacharya of ''[[India Today]]'' praised the film but felt that Dhulipala's character was the "weak link" as she "doesn't have much to do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/reviews/story/raman-raghav-2-movie-review-anurag-kashyap-nawazuddin-siddiqui-16026-2016-06-24|title=Raman Raghav 2.0 Movie Review|last=Bhattacharya|first=Ananya|work=India Today|date=24 June 2016|accessdate=10 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411072311/https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/reviews/story/raman-raghav-2-movie-review-anurag-kashyap-nawazuddin-siddiqui-16026-2016-06-24|archivedate=11 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the overseas reviewers, Deborah Young of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted Kaushal's performance and lack of character-depth of female characters, "Variety and depth of character are badly lacking on the female front, weakening the whole film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/psycho-raman-raman-raghav-20-894381|title='Psycho Raman' ('Raman Raghav 2.0'): Cannes Review|last=Young|first=Deborah|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=16 May 2016|accessdate=22 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520145936/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/psycho-raman-raman-raghav-20-894381|archivedate=20 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maitland McDonagh]] commented that the film performs a "surprisingly deep dive into lust, murder and violent obsession" and "delivers a couple of truly suspenseful sequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/reviews/film-review-raman-raghav-20|title=Film Review: Raman Raghav 2.0|last=McDonagh|first=Maitland|work=[[Film Journal International]]|date=23 June 2016|accessdate=10 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201092837/http://www.filmjournal.com/reviews/film-review-raman-raghav-20|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guy Lodge from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' mentioned it as a "luridly absorbing serial killer thriller" and felt Siddiqui's performance has an "unblinking intensity".&lt;ref name=variety /&gt; Wendy Ide from ''[[Screen International]]'' reviewed the film and called it a "propulsive and bloodthirsty thriller" and a "adrenalised energy which rarely flags." But he felt that the film lacks the sense of a "Manhunter-style battle of wits."&lt;ref name="screen" /&gt; Patrick Cooper of [[Bloody Disgusting]] wrote about the film, "If you only think of Bollywood when you think of Indian film, Psycho Raman will knock some sense into you, as it stands up with the grittiest American serial killer thrillers."&lt;ref name=fantasia /&gt; Suprateek Chatterjee of ''[[HuffPost]]'' mentioned the film as an "exercise in empty shock value".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/06/24/raman-raghav-2-review_n_10648434.html|title='Raman Raghav 2.0' Review: An Exercise In Empty Shock Value|last=Chatterjee|first=Suprateek|work=HuffPost|date=24 June 2016|accessdate=10 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501160434/http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/06/24/raman-raghav-2-review_n_10648434.html|archivedate=1 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Six Days of Ghent''' ({{lang-nl|Zesdaagse Vlaanderen-Gent}}) is a [[Six-day racing|six-day track cycling race]] held annually in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]].

It takes place in the [[Kuipke]] [[velodrome]] in Ghent's ''Citadelpark''.

The 2006 event from 21 November to 26 November was marred by the death of one of the riders. During the fifth day's racing, [[Isaac Gálvez]] of Spain rode into the barrier edging the outside of the track and died on his way to hospital.

The race director at Ghent is the former six-day rider and holder of the world record for number of six-day victories, [[Patrick Sercu]].

The 2009 event took place from 24 November to 29 November. A Danish team formed by [[Alex Rasmussen]] and his companion [[Michael Mørkøv]] won with a 3-point difference. The previous year's winner, [[Iljo Keisse]], ended second.

The 2010 event was held from 23 November to 28 November.

The track used for the event, the Kuipke, is measured at 166.66 m, with steep side banks surrounding the track.

The '''Sonic Mook Experiment''' is a music enterprise overseen by [[Sean McLusky]] which encompasses a club night and several albums.

The club claims that ''"like many great clubs in that it was about good music, drugs, scoop live performances, attractive fashionable people and quirky fad-inspiring outfits"''. 

The first Sonic Mook Experiment was held at a venue called The Wheel in [[Holborn]] in early 1997, taking place alongside [[Heavenly Records|Heavenly Records']] Social.  The emphasis was very much on eclecticism, with [[Sigue Sigue Sputnik]] playing against a backdrop of guitar, beats and hip hop music.  The club's move to 333 in [[Shoreditch]] saw live bands like [[Clinic (band)|Clinic]], [[Asian Dub Foundation]] and [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] play, as well as boundary-breaking underground electronic music, such as [[Jonathan Saul Kane|J Saul Kane]], [[Jerry Dammers]] and [[Andrew Weatherall]].  The club segued from the collision of electronic and indie in the late 90s into the more pronounced rock and roll of 2001 onwards.

In early 2002, Sonic Mook Relocated to the 93 Feet East club on [[Brick Lane]] in the East End of London. There it produced exclusive first live performances in London from bands like the [[New York City]] punk-funk outfit [[The Rapture (band)|The Rapture]].

In June 2002, it staged an event at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] on The Mall in London, during the Queen's [[Golden Jubilee]].  The event, held over four days, launched the second CD in the ''Future Rock &amp; Roll'' series.  The new album featured 25 tracks from some of the hottest new bands around, many for the first time on CD. Capturing the energy and attitude of the club night that spawned it and the nascent rock and roll scene in London and New York, it included tracks from [[The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster]], [[Liars (band)|The Liars]], [[The Martini Henry Rifles]],  [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]], Some Product by Anne McCloy, [[Fat Truckers]], and [[The Buff Medways]]. Several disturbances during the festival saw armed police escorting attendees away during the high security Jubilee celebrations nearby.

After a hiatus, aside from occasional get-togethers, the night returned to 333, more recently the Dogstar in [[Brixton]].

== Synopsis ==

=== Act 1 ===
1. Prologue. Nameless Voices asked questions — after Wallenberg's deeds and his fate: "Do we doing honour a living person or a dead person?"

2. The Conference I.

Sweden in 1944. A reception. Three guests whispering about the professional misses of the young Wallenberg. But three diplomats give his life new meaning. You go to entrust your with the mission to Hungary, to save "as many Jews as possible". The warnings of a lady, not to be exploited for foreign targets, can not stop Wallenberg. After initial hesitation, he accepts the order.

3. Railway Station I.

Hungary 1944. Wallenberg must helplessly watch as running a German officers and his men the order of the Nazi regime, "thousands of Jews every day ..."

4. The Plan I

Wallenberg takes a promising tactic: Swedish protective passports "Will make Jews like Sweden" and keep them from being deported.

5. Railway Station II

Wallenberg again meets the German officer. He manages to rescue some people from the brutality of the Nazis "Passport hits gun"

6. The rescued.

A group of saved of Wallenberg shows for the fragility of their destiny in mind: "Life is not be more than dead." Wallenberg realizes that there is every life is individual and very expensive.

7. The Plan II

Wallenberg is struggling with self-reproach: "Not enough! I not act enough!" He decides to face the evil.

8. Eichmann I.

Wallenberg met Adolf Eichmann. He confronted him with the goal of his saving deeds. But Eichmann was a bureaucrat and behaves like a gentleman. With relish, he shows the Wallenberg's limits of its possibilities in mind. And even the diplomats start to doubt the mission of Wallenberg. The time he runs away.

9. Station III.

Wallenberg throws himself into the work. But an encounter with a woman he has rescued leaves him utterly disappointed in the meaning of his deeds. She returns her protective passport to Wallenberg — so unbearably she feels the guilt to have survived "by chance".

10. The Plan III.

Wallenberg gets in panics about the immensity of his task. Once again, he encounters a woman who advises him to pause and reflect on itself.

11. The death march.

Hungary, January, 1945 — "And He made me pass by them round about, and lo! they were exceedingly many on the surface of the valley, and lo! they were exceedingly dry." Old testament, [[Book of Ezekiel]] (37, 2).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16135 Yechezkel - Ezekiel - Chapter 37]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last time Eichmann demonstrates his superiority. The war ended. Wallenberg hopes for a fresh start. But at the moment of the freeing appear two Russian soldiers. They summon Raoul Wallenberg for the questioning ...&lt;ref name="Karlsruhe2"&gt;[http://www.staatstheater.karlsruhe.de/media/programmheft/Programmheft_WALLENBERG_01.pdf Staatstheater Karlsruhe 2011/12. Program booklet No. 70.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Act 2 ===
12. SMERSH.

Moscow, 1945.
Wallenberg has got into the clutches of SMERSH, the Russian counter-intelligence. He is held prisoner in the infamous Moscow state prison Lubjanka. Two Russian officers denied knowing the whereabouts of Wallenberg: "We do not have him!"

13. The Conference II

Three diplomats visited Wallenberg. But instead of freeing him, they tell him about his new mission: "Only half of the war is now won". As a hero he was caught in the Cold War and more useful than a free man.

14. Gulag I.

Kolyma, uncertain time.
Wallenberg is subjected to a brutal interrogation. Meanwhile, the inmates of the Gulag tell each other about their fate and the arbitrariness of the judicial authorities. There are circulating rumors contradictory: "The Swede is alive. The Swede is dead."

15. Gulag II

Three Gulag prisoners believes Wallenberg recognizable as one of their fellow prisoners. His survival also maintains their hope. But Wallenberg not remember — neither of his time in the camp, even to his own identity. "There is a hole in my head". The other prisoners reacted with aggression to Wallenberg refusal to accept his role as savior.

Intermezzo.

Traces of Wallenberg are erased.

16. The struggle.

From Nothing appears Wallenberg 2, a masterful bugbear of the acts complained of Wallenberg, "I'm your hero, you will not get rid of me."

17. Eichmann II

Eichmann is preparing for the penalty. For the last time he taunted Wallenberg: While he was a "clean finish" would be granted, would fail a saving Wallenberg's death. Eichmann is hanged.

18. The conference III.

Wallenberg hopes explanations to find about his destiny with three diplomats. But these dismiss his doubts about the sense of the history as "child questions". Wallenberg silent. But his "For which?" does not remain in entirety unanswered. Two survivors remembers their rescue.

19. Wallenberg circus.

Future generations takes the heritage of Raoul Wallenberg. The public sings praises heroism. And Ronald Reagan appointed him an honorary citizen of the United States. Wallenberg 2 takes the honors of the crowd with pride: "No trace of a doubt!"

The voice of a woman remembers the dead.&lt;ref Name="Karlsruhe2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27501">A '''wine fault''' or '''defect''' is an unpleasant characteristic of a [[wine]] often resulting from poor [[winemaking]] practices or [[storage conditions (wine)|storage conditions]], and leading to '''wine spoilage'''. Many of the compounds that cause wine faults are already naturally present in wine but at insufficient concentrations to be of issue. In fact, depending on [[perception]], these concentrations may impart positive characters to the wine. However, when the concentration of these compounds greatly exceeds the [[sensory threshold]], they replace or obscure the [[flavor]]s and [[aromas (wine)|aromas]] that the wine should be expressing (or that the winemaker wants the wine to express). Ultimately the quality of the wine is reduced, making it less appealing and sometimes undrinkable.&lt;ref name="Baldy pg 37-39, et al"&gt;M. Baldy ''"The University Wine Course" Third Edition pgs 37-39, 69-80, 134-140 The Wine Appreciation Guild 2009 {{ISBN|0-932664-69-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many causes for the perception in wine faults, including poor [[hygiene]] at the winery, excessive or insufficient exposure of the wine to [[oxygen]], excessive or insufficient exposure of the wine to [[sulphur]], overextended [[maceration (wine)|maceration]] of the wine either pre- or post-[[Fermentation (wine)|fermentation]], faulty [[fining, filtering and stabilization of the wine]], the use of dirty [[oak barrels]], over-extended barrel aging and the use of poor quality corks. Outside of the winery, other factors within the control of the retailer or end user of the wine can contribute to the perception of flaws in the wine. These include poor [[storage of the wine]] that exposes it to excessive heat and temperature fluctuations as well as the use of dirty [[stemware]] during [[wine tasting]] that can introduce materials or aromas to what was previously a clean and fault-free wine.&lt;ref name="Baldy pg 37-39, et al"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bird pg 31-82, et al"&gt;D. Bird ''"Understanding Wine Technology"'' pg 31-82, 155-184, 202-222 DBQA Publishing 2005 {{ISBN|1-891267-91-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between flaws and faults==
In wine tasting, there is a big distinction made between what is considered a ''flaw'' and a ''fault''. Wine flaws are minor attributes that depart from what are perceived as normal wine characteristics. These include excessive [[sulfur dioxide]], [[volatile acidity]], ''[[Brettanomyces]]'' or "Brett aromas" and [[diacetyl]] or buttery aromas. The amount to which these aromas or attributes become excessive is dependent on the particular tastes and [[recognition threshold]] of the wine taster. Generally, a wine exhibiting these qualities is still considered drinkable by most people. However, some flaws such as volatile acidity and ''Brettanomyces'' can be considered a fault when they are in such an excess that they overwhelm other components of the wine. Wine faults are generally major attributes that make a wine undrinkable to most wine tasters. Examples of wine faults include [[acetaldehyde]] (except when purposely induced in wines like [[Sherry]] and [[Rancio]]), [[ethyl acetate]] and [[cork taint]].&lt;ref name="Baldy pg 37-39, et al"/&gt;

==Detecting faults in wine tasting==
The vast majority of wine faults are detected by the nose and the distinctive aromas that they give off. However, the presence of some wine faults can be detected by visual and taste perceptions. For example, premature oxidation can be noticed by the yellowing and [[Browning in red wine|browning]] of the [[wine's color]]. The sign of gas bubbles in wines that are not meant to be [[sparkling (wine)|sparkling]] can be a sign of [[Fermentation (wine)|refermentation]] or [[malolactic fermentation]] happening in the bottle. Unusual breaks in the color of the wine could be a sign of excessive [[copper]], [[iron]] or [[proteins]] that were not removed during fining or filtering. A wine with an unusual color for its variety or wine region could be a sign of excessive or insufficient maceration as well as poor temperature controls during fermentation. Tactile clues of potential wine faults include the burning, acidic taste associated with [[volatile acidity]] that can make a wine seem out of balance.&lt;ref name="Baldy pg 37-39, et al"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bird pg 31-82, et al"/&gt;

==Oxidation==
{{See also|Premature oxidation}}
The [[oxidation]] of wine is perhaps the most common of wine faults, as the presence of [[oxygen]] and a [[catalyst]] are the only requirements for the process to occur. 
Oxidation can occur throughout the winemaking process, and even after the wine has been bottled. [[Anthocyanin]]s, [[catechin]]s, epicatechins and other [[Phenolic content in wine|phenols]] present in wine are those most easily oxidised,&lt;ref name=duToitW&gt;duToit, W.J. (2005). [http://www.wynboer.co.za/recentarticles/200508oxygen.php3 Oxygen in winemaking: Part I]. WineLand. URL accessed on 2 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which leads to a loss of colour, flavour and aroma - sometimes referred to as ''flattening''. In most cases compounds such as [[sulfur dioxide]] or [[erythorbic acid]] are added to wine by winemakers, which protect the wine from oxidation and also bind with some of the oxidation products to reduce their organoleptic effect.&lt;ref name=goode&gt;Goode, Jamie (05/16/05). [http://www.wineint.com/storyprint.asp?sc=1810 Oxidation (link is dead)]. Wine International. URL accessed on 2 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from phenolic oxidation, the [[ethanol]] present within wine can also be oxidised into other compounds responsible for flavour and aroma taints.

[[File:Oxidation of ethanol.svg|center|thumb|500px|The oxidation of ethanol]]

===Acetaldehyde===
[[Acetaldehyde]] is an intermediate product of [[Yeast in winemaking|yeast]] [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]]; however, it is more commonly associated with [[ethanol]] [[oxidation]] catalysed by the enzyme [[alcohol dehydrogenase|ethanol dehydrogenase]]. Acetaldehyde production is also associated with the presence of surface film forming yeasts and bacteria, such as [[acetic acid bacteria]], which form the compound by the [[decarboxylation]] of [[pyruvate]]. The [[sensory threshold]] for acetaldehyde is 100-125 [[Micrograms|mg]]/[[litre|L]]. Beyond this level it imparts a ''[[sherry]]'' type character to the wine which can also be described as ''green apple'', ''sour'' and ''metallic''. Acetaldehyde [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] is also implicated in [[hangover]]s.

===Acetic acid===
[[Acetic acid]] in wine, often referred to as volatile acidity (VA) or ''vinegar taint'', can be contributed by many wine spoilage [[yeasts]] and [[bacteria]]. This can be from either a [[by-product]] of fermentation, or due to the spoilage of finished wine. Acetic acid bacteria, such as those from the genera ''[[Acetobacter]]'' and ''[[Gluconobacter]]'' produce high levels of acetic acid. The [[sensory threshold]] for acetic acid in wine is &gt;700&amp;nbsp;mg/L, with concentrations greater than 1.2-1.3 g/L becoming unpleasant.

There are different opinions as to what level of volatile acidity is appropriate for higher quality wine. Although too high a concentration is sure to leave an undesirable, 'vinegar' tasting wine, some wine's acetic acid levels are developed to create a more 'complex', desirable taste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wineint.com/story.asp?storyCode=1908 Volatile Acidity] - great article from [[Wine &amp; Spirit]] mag&lt;/ref&gt;  The renowned 1947 [[Château Cheval Blanc|Cheval Blanc]] is widely recognized to contain high levels of volatile acidity.

[[Ethyl acetate]] is formed in wine by the [[esterification]] of ethanol and acetic acid. Therefore, wines with high acetic acid levels are more likely to see ethyl acetate formation, but the compound does not contribute to the volatile acidity. It is a common microbial fault produced by [[wine spoilage yeast]]s, particularly ''[[Pichia anomala]]'' or ''[[Kloeckera apiculata]]''. High levels of ethyl acetate are also produced by [[lactic acid bacteria]] and [[acetic acid bacteria]].

==Sulfur compounds==
[[Sulfur]] is used as an [[food additive|additive]] throughout the winemaking process, primarily to stop oxidation as mentioned above but also as  [[antimicrobial]] agent. When managed properly in wine, its presence there is often undetected, however when used recklessly it can contribute to flavour and aroma taints which are very volatile and potent. Sulfur compounds typically have low sensory thresholds.

===Sulfur dioxide===
[[File:Sulfur-dioxide-2D.svg|right|150px|Sulfur dioxide]]
[[Sulfur dioxide]] is a common wine additive, used for its [[antioxidant]] and [[preservative]] properties. When its use is not managed well it can be overadded, with its perception in wine reminiscent of ''matchsticks'', ''burnt rubber'', or ''mothballs''. Wines such as these are often termed ''sulfitic''.

===Hydrogen sulfide===
[[File:Hydrogen-sulfide-2D-dimensions.svg|right|150px|Hydrogen sulfide]]
[[Hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is generally thought to be a metabolic by-product of yeast fermentation in [[Yeast assimilable nitrogen|nitrogen limited environments]]. It is formed when yeast ferments via the [[sulfate reduction pathway]]. Fermenting wine is often supplemented with [[diammonium phosphate]] (DAP) as a nitrogen source to prevent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S formation. The sensory threshold for hydrogen sulfide is 8-10 μg/L, with levels above this imparting a distinct ''rotten egg'' aroma to the wine. Hydrogen sulfide can further react with wine compounds to form mercaptans and [[disulfide]]s.

===Mercaptans===
[[File:Ethanethiol2.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[ethanethiol|ethyl mercaptan]]]]
[[Mercaptans]] (thiols) are produced in wine by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with other wine components such as ethanol. They can be formed if finished wine is allowed prolonged contact with the [[lees (fermentation)|lees]]. This can be prevented by [[racking]] the wine. Mercaptans have a very low sensory threshold, around 1.5 [[Micrograms|µg]]/[[litre|L]],&lt;ref name=ETS1&gt;[http://www.etslabs.com/pagetemplate/blank.asp?pageid=350 Technical Bulletin - Sulfides in Wine]. ETS Laboratories. URL accessed on 12 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; with levels above causing ''onion'', ''rubber'', and ''skunk'' type odours. Note that dimethyl disulfide is formed from the oxidation of methyl mercaptan.

===Dimethyl sulfide===
[[File:dimethyl sulfide structure.svg|right|140px|Dimethyl sulfide]]
[[Dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS) is naturally present in most wines, probably from the breakdown of sulfur containing amino acids.  Like ethyl acetate, levels of DMS below the sensory threshold can have a positive effect on flavour, contributing to ''fruityness'', ''fullness'', and ''complexity''. Levels above the sensory threshold of &gt;30&amp;nbsp;µg/L in white wines and &gt;50&amp;nbsp;µg/L for red wines, give the wine characteristics of ''cooked cabbage'', ''canned corn'', ''asparagus'' or ''truffles''.

==Environmental==

===Cork taint===
[[File:2,4,6-Trichloroanisole.svg|120px|right|thumb|2,4,6-trichloroanisole]]
{{Main article|Cork taint}}
Cork taint is a wine fault mostly attributed to the compound [[2,4,6-trichloroanisole]] (TCA), although other compounds such as [[guaiacol]], [[geosmin]], [[2-methylisoborneol]], [[1-Octen-3-ol|1-octen-3-ol]], [[1-octen-3-one]], [[2,3,4,6-tetrachloroanisole]], [[pentachloroanisole]], and [[2,4,6-tribromoanisole]] are also thought to be involved.&lt;ref name=LaMar&gt;LaMar, Jim (09/25/02). [http://www.winepros.org/wine101/vincyc-tca.htm Cork Taint]. URL accessed on 12 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; TCA most likely originates as a [[metabolite]] of [[mould]] growth on [[chlorine]]-bleached wine corks and barrels. It causes ''earthy'', ''mouldy'', and ''musty'' aromas in wine that easily mask the natural fruit aromas, making the wine very unappealing. Wines in this state are often described as ''"corked"''. As cork taint has gained a wide reputation as a wine fault, other faults are often mistakenly attributed to it.

===Heat damage===
Heat damaged wines are often casually referred to as ''cooked'', which suggests how heat can affect a wine. They are also known as '''maderized''' wine, from [[Madeira wine]], which is intentionally exposed to heat.  The ideal storage temperature for wine is generally accepted to be 13&amp;nbsp;°C (55&amp;nbsp;°F). Wines that are stored at temperatures greatly higher than this will experience an increased aging rate. Wines exposed to extreme temperatures will [[thermal expansion|thermally expand]], and may even push up between the cork and bottle and leak from the top. When opening a bottle of wine, if a trace of wine is visible along the length of the cork, the cork is partially pushed out of the bottle, or wine is visible on the top of the cork while it is still in the bottle, it has most likely been heat damaged. Heat damaged wines often become oxidized, and red wines may take on a brick color.

Even if the temperatures do not reach extremes, temperature variation alone can also damage bottled wine through oxidation. All corks allow some leakage of air (hence old wines become increasingly oxidized), and temperature fluctuations will vary the pressure differential between the inside and outside of the bottle and will act to "pump" air into the bottle at a faster rate than will occur at any temperature strictly maintained.

Reputedly, heat damage is the most widespread and common problem found in wines. It often goes unnoticed because of the prevalence of the problem, consumers don't know it's possible, and most often would just chalk the problem up to poor quality, or other factors.

===Lightstrike===
Lightstruck wines are those that have had excessive exposure to [[ultraviolet]] light, particularly in the range 325 to 450&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=drouhin&gt;Drouhin, R.J. (01/23/98) [http://www.drouhin.com/wineviti/glasses.html Bottle Glass]. URL Accessed 3 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Very delicate wines, such as [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]]s, are generally worst affected, with the fault causing a ''wet cardboard'' or ''wet wool'' type flavour and aroma. Red wines rarely become lightstruck because of the phenolic compounds present within the wine that protect it. Lightstrike is thought to be caused by sulfur compounds such as [[dimethyl sulfide]]. In France lightstrike is known as "''goût de lumière''", which translates to ''a taste of light''. The fault explains why wines are generally bottled in coloured glass, which blocks the ultraviolet light, and why wine should be stored in dark environments.

===Ladybird (pyrazine) taint===
Some insects present in the grapes at harvest inevitably end up in the press and for the most part are inoffensive. Others, notably the [[Harmonia axyridis|Asian lady beetle]], release unpleasant smelling nitrogen heterocycles as a defensive mechanism when disturbed. In sufficient quantities these can affect the wine's odor and taste. With an olfactory detection threshold of a few ppb, the principal active compound is [[isopropyl methoxy pyrazine]] - this molecule is perceived as rancid [[peanut butter]], bitter and herbal, green [[bell pepper]], or urine like. This is also a naturally occurring compound in Sauvignon grapes and so [[pyrazine]] taint has been known to make [[Riesling]]s taste like [[Sauvignon blanc]]{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}.

==Microbiological==

===''Brettanomyces'' (''Dekkera'')===
{{Main article|Brettanomyces}}
The yeast ''[[Brettanomyces]]'' produces an array of [[metabolite]]s when growing in wine, some of which are volatile [[Phenolic content in wine|phenol]]ic compounds. Together these compounds are often referred to as ''phenolic taint'', ''"Brettanomyces character"'', or simply "Brett". The main constituents are listed below, with their sensory threshold and common sensory descriptors:
*'''[[4-ethylphenol]]''' (&gt;140&amp;nbsp;µg/L): Band-aids, barnyard, horse stable, antiseptic
*'''[[4-ethylguaiacol]]''' (&gt;600&amp;nbsp;µg/L): Bacon, spice, cloves, smoky
*'''[[3-Methylbutanoic acid|isovaleric acid]]''': Sweaty, cheese, rancidity

===Geosmin===
[[File:Geosmin minus acsv.svg|130px|right]]
[[Geosmin]] is a compound with a very distinct ''earthy'', ''musty'', ''beetroot'', even ''turnip'' flavour and aroma and has an extremely low sensory threshold of down to 10 parts per trillion. Its presence in wine is usually derived as metabolite from the growth of filamentous [[Actinobacteria|actinomycetes]] such as ''[[Streptomyces]]'', and [[mold|mould]]s such as ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]'' and ''Penicillium expansum'', on grapes. Wines affected by but not attributed to geosmins are often thought to have earthy properties due to [[terroir]].&lt;ref name=kennel&gt;Kennel, Florence (14/12/05). [http://www.decanter.com/news/60674.html Bordeaux boffin solves geosmin conundrum]. Decanter.com. URL accessed on 2 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The geosmin fault occurs worldwide and has been found in recent vintages of red wines from [[Beaujolais]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] and the [[Loire]] in France. Geosmin is also thought to be a contributing factor in [[cork taint]].

===Lactic acid bacteria===
{{Main article|Malolactic_fermentation#Wine_faults}}
[[Lactic acid bacteria]] have a useful role in winemaking converting [[malic acid]] to lactic acid in [[malolactic fermentation]]. However, after this function has completed, the bacteria may still be present within the wine, where they can metabolise other compounds and produce wine faults. Wines that have not undergone malolactic fermentation may be contaminated with lactic acid bacteria, leading to refermentation of the wine with it becoming [[turbidity|turbid]], ''swampy'', and slightly [[effervescence|effervescent]] or ''spritzy''. This can be avoided by sterile filtering wine directly before bottling. Lactic acid bacteria can also be responsible for other wine faults such as those below.

====Bitterness taint====
[[File:Acrolein-skeletal.png|right|120px|thumb|Acrolein]]
Bitterness taint or ''amertume'' is rather uncommon and is produced by certain strains of bacteria from the genera ''[[Pediococcus]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', and ''[[Oenococcus]]''. It begins by the degradation of [[glycerol]], a compound naturally found in wine at levels of 5-8 g/L, via a [[dehydratase]] enzyme to ''3-hydroxypropionaldehyde''. During ageing this is further dehydrated to [[acrolein]] which reacts with the [[anthocyanin]]s and other phenols present within the wine to form the taint.&lt;ref name=duToitM&gt;duToit, M., Pretorius, I.S. (2000). “Microbial spoilage and preservation of wine: Using weapons from nature's own arsenal - A review”. South African Journal of Enology and Viticulture 21: 74-96.&lt;/ref&gt; As red wines contain high levels of anthocyanins they are generally more susceptible.

====Diacetyl====
[[File:diacetyl structure.svg|130px|right|thumb|Diacetyl]]
[[Diacetyl]] in wine is produced by [[lactic acid bacteria]], mainly ''[[Oenococcus oeni]]''. In low levels it can impart positive ''nutty'' or ''caramel'' characters, however at levels above 5&amp;nbsp;mg/L it creates an intense ''buttery'' or ''[[butterscotch]]'' flavour, where it is perceived as a flaw. The sensory threshold for the compound can vary depending on the levels of certain wine components, such as sulfur dioxide. It can be produced as a metabolite of [[citric acid]] when all of the [[malic acid]] has been consumed. Diacetyl rarely taints wine to levels where it becomes undrinkable.&lt;ref name=gibson&gt;Gibson, George; Farkas, Mike [http://www.bcawa.ca/winemaking/flaws.htm Flaws and Faults in Wine]. URL accessed on 12 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geranium taint====
[[File:2-ethoxy-3,5-hexadiene.svg|200px|right|thumb|2-ethoxy-3,5-hexadiene]]
Geranium taint, as the name suggests, is a flavour and aroma taint in wine reminiscent of [[pelargonium|geranium]] leaves. The compound responsible is ''[[2-ethoxyhexa-3,5-diene]]'', which has a low sensory threshold concentration of 1&amp;nbsp;ng/L.&lt;ref name=huhn&gt;Hühn, T; Sponholz, W.R. and Pulver, D. (1999). [http://www.beverages.ch/service/Microorganisms.PDF The influence of microorganisms in winemaking]. (PDF) URL accessed on 2 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In wine it is formed during the [[metabolism]] of [[potassium sorbate]] by [[lactic acid bacteria]]. Potassium sorbate is sometimes added to wine as a [[preservative]] against yeast, however its use is generally kept to a minimum due to the possibility of the taint developing. The production of the taint begins with the conversion of [[sorbic acid]] to the alcohol ''[[sorbinol]]''. The alcohol is then [[isomerisation|isomerised]] in the presence of acid to ''[[3,5-hexadiene-2-ol]]'', which is then esterified with ethanol to form ''[[2-ethoxy-3,5-hexadiene]]''.&lt;ref
name=huhn/&gt; As ethanol is necessary for the conversion, the geranium taint is not usually found in [[must]].

====Mannitol====
[[File:Mannitol structure.png|150px|thumb|right|Mannitol]]
[[Mannitol]] is a [[sugar alcohol]], and in wine it is produced by [[heterofermentative]] lactic acid bacteria, such as ''[[Lactobacillus brevis]]'', by the [[redox|reduction]] of [[fructose]]. Its perception is often complicated as it generally exists in wine alongside other faults, but it is usually described as [[viscous]], [[ester]]-like combined with a sweet and irritating finish.&lt;ref name=duToitM/&gt;  Mannitol is usually produced in wines that undergo malolactic fermentation with a high level of [[residual sugar]]s still present. Expert winemakers oftentimes add small amounts of sulfur dioxide during the crushing step to reduce early bacterial growth.

====Ropiness====
Ropiness is manifested as an increase in [[viscosity]] and a ''slimey'' or ''fatty'' mouthfeel of a wine. In France the fault is known as "''graisse''", which translates to ''fat''. The problem stems from the production of [[dextrin]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s by certain lactic acid bacteria, particularly of the genera ''[[Leuconostoc]]'' and ''[[Pediococcus]]''.

===Mousiness===
[[File:1-(3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-2-yl)-ethanone.svg|right|thumb|150px|''2-acetyl-3,4,5,6-&lt;br /&gt;tetrahydropyridine'']]
Mousiness is a wine fault most often attributed to ''Brettanomyces'' but can also originate from the [[lactic acid bacteria]] ''[[Lactobacillus brevis]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus fermentum]]'', and ''[[Lactobacillus hilgardii]],''&lt;ref name=duToitM/&gt; and hence can occur in [[malolactic fermentation]]. The compounds responsible are [[lysine]] derivatives, mainly;
*[[2-acetyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridine]]
*[[2-acetyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridine]]
*[[2-ethyltetrahydropyridine]]&lt;ref name=marias&gt;Marais, Johann [http://www.wynboer.co.za/recentarticles/0299nitrogen.php3 Flavourful nitrogen containing wine constituents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928171657/http://www.wynboer.co.za/recentarticles/0299nitrogen.php3 |date=2006-09-28 }}. Wynboer. URL accessed on 12 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[2-acetyl-1-pyrrolene]]
The taints are not volatile at the [[pH]] of wine, and therefore not obvious as an aroma. However, when mixed with the slightly basic pH of saliva they can become very apparent on the palate,&lt;ref name=gawell&gt;Gawell, Richard [http://www.aromadictionary.com/articles/mousey_article.html Somellier, A Mouse Must Have Wee'd in My Wine!]. aromadictionary.com. URL accessed on 12 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; especially at the back of the mouth, as ''mouse cage'' or ''mouse urine''.

=== Refermentation ===
Refermentation, sometimes called [[secondary fermentation (wine)|secondary fermentation]], is caused by yeasts refermenting the [[residual sugar]] present within bottled wine. It occurs when [[sweetness of wine|sweet wines]] are bottled in non-[[Asepsis|sterile]] conditions, allowing the presence of microorganisms. The most common yeast to referment wine is the standard wine fermentation yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', but has also been attributed to ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'' and ''[[Zygosaccharomyces bailii]]''.&lt;ref name=duToitM/&gt; The main issues associated with the fault include [[turbidity]] (from yeast [[biomass]] production), excess ethanol production (may violate [[wine label|labelling]] laws), slight [[carbonation]], and some coarse odours. Refermentation can be prevented by bottling wines dry (with residual sugar levels &lt;1.0g/L), sterile filtering wine prior to bottling, or adding preservative chemicals such as [[dimethyl dicarbonate]]. The [[Portuguese wine]] style known as "[[vinho verde|vinhos verdes]]" used to rely on this secondary fermentation in bottle to impart a slight [[spritz (wine)|spritziness]] to the wine, but now usually uses artificial carbonation.

==  Bunch rots ==
Organisms responsible for bunch rot of grape berries are filamentous fungi, the most common of these being ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]'' (gray mold) However, there are a range of other fungi responsible for the rotting of grapes such as ''[[Aspergillus]]'' spp., ''[[Penicillium]]'' spp., and fungi found in subtropical climates (e.g., ''[[Colletotrichum]]'' spp. (ripe rot) and ''[[Greeneria uvicola]]'' (bitter rot)). A further group more commonly associated with diseases of the vegetative tissues of the vine can also infect grape berries (e.g., [[Botryosphaeriaceae]], ''[[Phomopsis viticola]]''). Compounds found in bunch rot affected grapes and wine are typically described as having mushroom, earthy odors and include geosmin, [[2-methylisoborneol]], [[1-octen-3-ol]], [[2-octen-1-ol]], [[fenchol]] and [[fenchone]].&lt;ref&gt;Grapevine bunch rots: impacts on wine composition, quality, and potential procedures for the removal of wine faults.
