The '''Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party''' (meaning "resurrection"; {{lang-ar|حزب البعث العربي الاشتراكي}} ''Hizb al-Baʿath al-ʿArabī al-Ishtirākī''), also referred to as the pro-Syrian Ba'ath movement, is a [[Ba'athism#Neo-Ba'athism|neo-Ba'athist]] [[political party]] with branches across the [[Arab world]]. The party emerged from a split in the [[Ba'ath Party]] in February 1966 and leads the government in [[Syria]]. From 1970 until 2000, the party was led by the Syrian president [[Hafez al-Assad]]. {{As of|2000}}, leadership has been shared between his son [[Bashar al-Assad]] (head of the Syrian regional organization) and [[Abdullah al-Ahmar]] (head of the pan-Arab national organization). [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|The Syrian branch of the party]] is the largest organisation within the Syrian-led Ba'ath Party.

===Organization===
The party is organized along [[Leninist]] lines, a policy stemming back to Aflaq and Bitar's leadership before the split.&lt;ref name="f8"&gt;{{cite book |author = Collelo|page = 214|title = Syria: A Country Study|location = |publisher = Federal Research Division, Library of Congress|year = 1988|isbn = |first = Thomas|url = https://www.loc.gov/item/87600488/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest organ of the party is the Party Congress. The Congress elects a General Secretary and a National Command. Under the National Command there is a Regional Command for each state in which the party operates. The regions are divided into branches, which are divided into companies. A branch consists of two or more companies. A company comprises three to seven cells.&lt;ref name="orga"&gt;{{cite book | author = Choueiri, Youssef M. |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=4xiI0Q-fHzEC&amp;pg=PA234 234] | title = Arab nationalism: a History: Nation and State in the Arab World | location = | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-631-21729-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each cell has between three and seven members.&lt;ref name="f1"/&gt;

In theory, the National Command of the party is the embryonic government for the entire Arab nation. The body comprises 21 members, half of whom are Syrian.&lt;ref name="f8"/&gt; In practice, the Syrian Regional Command is the more powerful institution inside the party.&lt;ref name="f8-2"&gt;{{cite book | author = Yildiz, Kerim |  page = 46 | title = The Kurds in Syria: The Forgotten People | location = | publisher = [[Pluto Press]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-7453-2499-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian Regional Command is the real political leadership in Syria; the power of the National Command has become more symbolic than real. A seat in National Command has become a sinecure, an honorary post given to Syrian politicians as they retire from active political life.&lt;ref name="f1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pol2"/&gt; Hafez al-Assad rarely had time to attend National Command meetings. Instead, he appointed Vice President for Party Affairs Zuhayr Mashariqa or Abd al-Halim Khaddam to represent him at National Command meetings.&lt;ref name="pol2"&gt;{{cite book | author = Perthes, Volker |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=WtsjG0aQpysC&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 156] | title = The Political Economy of Syria Under Asad | location = | publisher = [[I.B. Tauris]] | year = 1997 | isbn = 1-86064-192-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, the National Command could conduct proselytism and form new Regional Commands across the Arab world and support weaker Regional Commands, but Syrian policymakers have curtailed that capacity.&lt;ref name="f1"&gt;{{cite book |author = Collelo|page = 215|title = Syria: A Country Study|location = |publisher = Research Division, Library of Congress|year = 1988|isbn = |first = Thomas|url = https://www.loc.gov/item/87600488/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Organization of Sudan}}
During the 1980s, the party was called Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Organization of Sudan (differentiating it from the pro-Iraqi party, called Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Country of Sudan). The party participated in the 1986 election as part of the Progressive National Front.&lt;ref name="ray"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lain, Donald Ray|pages=58 –60|title=Dictionary of the African Left: Parties, Movements and Groups|location=|publisher=[[Dartmouth College Press|Dartmouth]]|year=1989|isbn=1-85521-014-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party held its third regional congress in [[Khartoum]] on February 5–6, 2009.

The party slogan "Unity, Freedom, Socialism" is enshrined in the Constitution of the Syrian Arab Republic.&lt;ref name="pol2"/&gt; The eighth article of the Constitution stipulated that "[t]he leading party in the society and the state is the ... Ba'ath Party. It leads the National Progressive Front seeking to unify the resources of the masses of the people and place them at the service of the goals of the Arab nation".&lt;ref name="ai"/&gt; The Constitution was adopted in 1973.&lt;ref name="f8-3"&gt;{{cite book | author = Lane, Jan-Erik |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=gkToAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 122] | title = Constitutions and Political Theory | location = | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-7190-4648-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per the Constitution of the Syrian Arab Republic, it is the Regional Command of the party that nominates the candidate for president of the republic.&lt;ref name="pol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="con"/&gt; The Constitution does not explicitly say that the president has to be the leader of the party, but the National Progressive Front (NPF) charter states that president of the Syrian Arab Republic and the secretary of the party is also the president of the NPF.&lt;!--What if the President of the Republic and the Secretary of the Party are two different people? Reply: This is precisely what is odd about this set-up. The NPF charter implies that it is taken for granted that President of SAR/Regional Party Secretary is the same person, even though there is no such provision in party or republican constitution. --&gt;&lt;ref name="pol"/&gt;

The party has dominated the Syrian parliament since 1963.&lt;ref name="ai"/&gt; The party leads the [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|National Progressive Front]] and in all elections conducted under this constitution has obtained the majority of the 167 parliamentary seats reserved for the Front.&lt;ref name="con"&gt;{{cite book |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&amp;pg=PA256 256] | title = The World and Its Peoples | location = | publisher = [[Marshall Cavendish]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-7614-7571-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2003 parliamentary election, the party secured 135 of the seats.&lt;ref name="ai"/&gt;

As of the mid-2000s, the party membership in Syria was estimated at 800,000. Key party organs in Syria are ''Al-Ba'ath'' and ''Al-Thawra''.&lt;ref name="ai"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Tucker, Spencer |author2=Roberts, Priscillia Mary |  pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=YAd8efHdVzIC&amp;pg=PA183 183–184] | title =  The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and Military History | location = | publisher = [[ABC-CLIO]] | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-85109-841-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Syrian Regional Command has 21 members.&lt;ref name="f1"/&gt; As of 1987, the Syrian Regional Command comprised the three vice presidents of the Syrian Arab Republic, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, the parliamentary speaker, the Aleppo and [[Hama]] party secretaries as well as the heads of the party bureaus for [[trade union]]s, economy and higher education.&lt;ref name="f1"/&gt;

The seventh Syrian regional party congress was held in January 1980. The congress created a new institution, the Central Committee, to act as an intermediary body between the Regional Command and local branches. The Central Committee had 75 members. The eighth regional congress decided to expand the Central Committee to 95 members. The Central Committee was charged with electing the Regional Command, which previously had been done by the regional congress delegates. The Central Committee represents the regional congress when the congress is not in session.&lt;ref name="f1"/&gt;

The party has 19 branches in Syria: one in each of the thirteen provinces: one in Damascus, one in Aleppo and one at each of the four universities.&lt;ref name="f1"/&gt; In most cases, the governor of a province, police chief, mayor and other local dignitaries make up the Branch Command, but the Branch Command Secretary and other executive positions are filled by party whole-timers.{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=what is meant by "whole-timers"?}}&lt;ref name="f1"/&gt;

The Syrian regional party congress is held every four years. While it is a strictly orchestrated affair, the regional congress has been a venue for actual debates on current affairs. Criticism against corruption and economic stagnation were expressed at the 1985 regional congress, albeit candidly. This congress was attended by 771 branch delegates.&lt;ref name="f2"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Federal Research Division]] |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=B9L9ZWtnYsgC&amp;pg=PA216 216] | title = Syria: A Country Study | location = | publisher = [[Kessinger Publishing]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-4191-5022-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party has a parallel structure within the Syrian armed forces. The military and civilian sectors only meet at the regional level, as the military sector is represented in the Regional Command and sends delegates to regional congresses. The military sector is divided into branches, operating at the battalion level. The head of a military party branch is called a ''tawjihi'' ("guide").&lt;ref name="f1"/&gt;

The party has an Inspection and Control Committee, instituted in 1980.&lt;ref name="f2"/&gt; The Party Security Law was passed in 1979, criminalizing "deviations" inside the party and attacks on the party.&lt;ref name="f2"/&gt;

The party has three bureaus for coordinating work in mass organizations: the Popular Organizations Bureau (coordinating the People's Army militia, the [[Revolutionary Youth Union]], Students Union and the [[General Union of Syrian Women]]); the Workers Bureau (coordinating the [[General Federation of Trade Unions (Syria)|General Federation of Trade Unions]]); and the Peasants Bureau (coordinating the Peasants Federation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Dishon |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=s3torytPXdUC&amp;pg=PA720 720] | title = Middle East Record 1968 | location = | publisher = [[John Wiley and Sons]] | year = 1973 | isbn = 0-470-21611-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children joined the Vanguards, an organization for grade-school boys and girls. Vanguards attended paramilitary summer camps operated by the armed forces. In the mid-1970s, the party ran a mass campaign for the mobilization of peasants into the Peasants Federation.&lt;ref name="f3"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Federal Research Division]] |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=B9L9ZWtnYsgC&amp;pg=PA217 217] | title = Syria: A Country Study | location = | publisher = [[Kessinger Publishing]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-4191-5022-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party has its own system of political education, including the Higher Political Institute (a graduate school of the [[University of Damascus]]).&lt;ref name="f3"/&gt;

[[Abdul Halim Khaddam]] resigned as National Command and Central Committee member in mid-2005.&lt;ref name="i1"&gt;{{cite book | author = Moubayed, Sami M. |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA272 272] | title = Steel &amp; Silk: Men and Women Who Shaped Syria 1900–2000 | location = | publisher = Cune Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-885942-40-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tunisia===
There is no formal structure linked to the Damascus-based Ba'ath Party. Most Ba'athists in [[Tunisia]] support the Iraqi faction as members of the [[Ba'ath Movement]] or the more leftist and radical the Party of the Arab and Democratic Vanguard. Only a small number of militants headed by Mohamed Salah Hermassi (a member of the Damascus-based National Command) are historically linked to [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;http://observatoiretunisien.org/upload/file/Boubakri(1).pdf{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ba'athism in Yemen originated in the 1950s. The party worked underground until 1990.

'''Baking Pot''' is a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological site]] located in the [[Belize River|Belize River Valley]] on the southern bank of the river, northeast of modern-day town of [[San Ignacio (town)|San Ignacio]] in the [[Cayo District]] of [[Belize]]; it is {{convert|6|km|mi}} downstream from the [[Barton Ramie]] and [[Lower Dover]] archaeological sites. Baking Pot is associated with an extensive amount of research into Maya settlements, community-based archaeology, and of agricultural production; the site possesses lithic workshops, and possible evidence of cash-cropping [[Cocoa bean|cacao]]&lt;ref name="Willey 65"&gt;Willey, G. R., Bullard, W. R., Glass, J. B., Gifford, J. C., &amp; Elliot, O. (1965). Prehistoric Maya settlements in the Belize Valley. Cambridge, Mass: Peabody Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Audet, Carolyn, and Jaime J. Awe. (2004)What's Cooking at Baking Pot: A Report of the 2001-2003 Field Seasons. In Jaime Awe, John Morris and Sherilyne Jones, Eds., Research Reports in Belezian Archaeology, Vol 1, pp. 49-60.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a long occupation from the [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic]] through to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] period.

The site at Baking Pot is unique in that it had a large population during the Terminal Classic while other sites in the Belize River Valley were declining, and occupation continued into the Postclassic whereas major Classic Period sites in the southern lowlands were by then abandoned.&lt;ref name="Aimers, James J. 2003"&gt;Aimers, James J. (2003). Abandonment and Nonabandonment at Baking Pot, Belize. In Takeshi Inomata and Ronald W. Wedd, Eds., The Archaeology of Settlement Abandonment in Middle America. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Classic period site cores in much of the Belize Valley were abandoned, but at Baking Pot “survey and excavation of house mounds and plazuela groups immediately outside the site core suggested that Postclassic occupation there is more substantial and prolonged than in the site core”.&lt;ref name="Aimers, James J. 2003"/&gt; The abundance of [[Tayasal]]-associated Augustine Red ceramics at Baking Pot, along with the association of these ceramics with a different organizational and settlement pattern suggest that there was an intrusion of people from central [[Petén Basin|Petén]] during this time.&lt;ref name="Aimers, James J. 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chase, Arlen F. (1986). Time Depth or Vacuum: The 11.3.0.0.0 Correlation and the Lowland Maya Postclassic, in J.A. Sabloff and E.W. Andrews V, Eds., Late Lowland Maya Civilization: Classic to Postclassic, pp. 99-140, University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers like Aimers favor a gradual abandonment of the site at a much later time period than other sites in the region.

== History ==
In the late [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic]], Baking Pot had a small population with little public [[Maya architecture|architecture]]. In the Early Classic, the site experienced a construction boom. Two architectural groups were built, with Group A to the north and Group B (containing the largest structure at Baking Pot) to the south. This north-south orientation is similar to nearby [[Xunantunich]].&lt;ref name="Awe 2008"&gt;Awe, Jaime J. (2008) Architectural Manifestations of Power and Prestige: Examples from Classic Period Monumental Architecture at Cahal Pech, Xunantunich and Caracol, Belize. In John Morris, Sherilyne Jones, Jaime Awe, and Christophe Helmke, Eds., Research Reports in Belizean Archaeology  Volume 5, pp. 159-174. Institute of Archaeology, National Institute of Culture and History, Belmopan, Belize.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier excavators like Ricketson, [[Gordon Willey]], and Bullard and Bullard describe these groups as Group 1 and Group 2. These major complexes make up the center of Baking Pot and are connected by a causeway (or ''[[sacbe]]''). In the Late Classic, the population increased to approximately 3000 people. Toward the end of the Classic period the local elite left and the palace complexes in the city center were abandoned. In the early Postclassic, people were still living on a portion of the site but rarely used the ceremonial center and there was very little new construction. Much of the people living at Baking Pot were farmers; being close to the Belize River the site has fertile soil in an [[alluvial valley]] and is primarily associated with agricultural production.

== Excavations ==
In the 1920s, A.H. Anderson first conducted archaeological research at Baking Pot after some materials from the site were used in the construction of the western highway.  Later excavations by Oliver Ricketson,&lt;ref name ="Ricketson 31"&gt;Ricketson, O. G. (1931). Excavations at Baking Pot, British Honduras. In Contributions to American Archaeology, Vol 1, No. 1, pp. 1-28. Washington, D.C: Carnegie Institute of Washington&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon Willey in the 1950s and William Bullard and Mary Bullard completed major excavations in the 1960s,.&lt;ref name ="Bullard 65"&gt;Bullard, W. R., &amp; Bullard, M. R. (1965). Late classic finds at Baking Pot, British Honduras. Art and Archaeology Occasional Papers, No. 8. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Wiley is best known for his excavations and settlement research at Barton Ramie and for his focus on Maya households during a time when most people were only focused on elite.&lt;ref name="Willey 65"/&gt; Limited work was done at the site during the 1920s, 1950s, and 1960s until the [[Belize Valley Archeological Reconnaissance Project]] started working there in the 1990s, with its work continuing into the 21st century&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Awe, Jaime J., Julie Hoggarth, and Christophe Helmke. Prehistoric Settlement Patterns in the Upper Belize River Valley and Their Implications for Models of Low-Density Urbanism.&lt;/ref&gt; with BVAR researchers working under the direction of Dr. Jaime Awe, including Jim Conlon, Jim Aimers, Josalyn Ferguson, Jennifer Piehl, Carolyn Audet, Christophe Helmke, and Julie Hoggarth.

A complex water management system exists at the site, including a series of aguadas and seasonal streams, along with the presence of drains in the palace complex, work to feed water from the foothills to the south down through the site and into the aduadas before dumping into the Belize River.  Baking Pot is named after large pots were found by archaeologists that were once used to boil [[chicle]]. At the Bedran group nearby, a house group that was excavated, burial grave goods were found including painted ceramic vessels with a [[primary standard sequence]] around the top dated to the Early Classic.&lt;ref name="AweHelmke 05"&gt;Awe, Jaime J. and Christophe G.B. Helmke. (2005). Alive and Kicking in the 3rd to 6th Centuries A.D.: Defining the Early Classic in the Belize River Valley. In Jaime Awe, John Morris, Sherilyne Jones, and Christophe Helmke, Eds., Research Reports in Belizean Archaeology, Vol 2:39-52. Institute of Archaeology, National Institute of Culture and History, Belmopan, Belize.&lt;/ref&gt; These vessels were cacao drinking vessels and were thought to contain a placename: 
''Four Water Place'', although this is now reinterpreted as a royal title.  There are no carved monuments at Baking Pot, although several uncarved [[Maya stelae|stelae]] and uncarved altars have been found.

A causeway extends south and to the west of Group B and ends at a causeway terminus structure (Mound 190). Here hundreds of broken vessels were found in front of the stairway, possibly from a termination ritual. Mound 190 had deposits with finger bones, an altar, and intact mini ceramic vessels below it with tiny specks of jade. This mound also contains evidence of ritual activity and is believed to be used for ritual/ceremonial purposes. The discovery of finger bones is similar to the finger bowl caches associated with Caracol (and also found at [[Cahal Pech]])  and may provide evidence of Caracol control or influence at Baking Pot at the time.&lt;ref name="HelmkeAwe 08"&gt;Helmke, Christophe and Jaime J. Awe. (2008). Organización Territorial de los Antiguos Mayas de Belice Central: Confluencia de Datos Arqueológicos y Epigráficos. Mayeb 20:65-91. In press Ancient Maya Territorial Organization of Central Belize: Confluence of Archaeological and Epigraphic Data. Acta Mesoamericana.&lt;/ref&gt; Vessel 2 at Baking Pot describes its owner in a similar structure that is found at Caracol as well.&lt;ref name="HelmkeAwe 08" /&gt; [[Naranjo]] pottery has also been found here at Baking Pot, and evidence for a push to control the Belize River Valley after the fall of Tikal was described on a monument at Xunantunich.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3224">'''Book swapping''' or '''book exchange''' is the practice of a [[trade|swap]] of [[books]] between one person and another. Practiced among book groups, friends and colleagues at work, it provides an inexpensive way for people to exchange books, find out about new books and obtain a new book to read without having to pay.  Because swaps occur between individuals, without central distribution or warehousing, and without the copyright owner making a profit, the practice has been compared to [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) systems such as [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1022148/bittorrent-arrives-books BitTorrent arrives for books], the INQUIRER&lt;/ref&gt;—except that hard-copy original analog objects are exchanged.

== College book exchange programs ==
Many colleges and universities have developed online book exchange programs to help students save money on [[textbook]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.usf.edu/ Textbook Affordability Project (TAP) at USF], TAP USF website&lt;/ref&gt; Some colleges build their own systems and others use systems from third party service providers.

== Informal book exchanges ==
[[File:Street book exchange 181st Street and Fort Washington Ave Hudson Heights.jpg|thumb|A "street book exchange" in [[Washington Heights, New York]].]]

Some book exchanges are informal - a shelf or box is provided where books can be left or picked up. The exchange relies on users leaving and taking books and is generally not supervised.

This is a frequent practice in [[youth hostel]]s where travellers can leave a book and take a different book with them. Some [[railway stations]] in Great Britain have informal book exchanges and one has also been set up in a [[phone box]] in [[Kington Magna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/428572/What-a-novel-idea-villagers-transform-redundant-phone-box-into-a-LIBRARY What a novel idea - villagers transform redundant phone box into a LIBRARY], ''Daily Express''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bureaucratic inertia''' is the inevitable tendency of [[bureaucratic]] organizations to perpetuate the established procedures and modes, even if they are counterproductive and/or diametrically opposed to established organizational goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Neville |first=Sarah |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/51a83fde-704d-11e2-ab31-00144feab49a.html#axzz2LHLkdp2Q |title=NHS inquiry finds failings ‘at every level’ |publisher=FT.com |date=2013-02-06 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unchecked growth may continue independently of the organization's success or failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/27/green-deal-benefits-tory-friends |title=The green deal is just for fatcats, not consumers &amp;#124; John Vidal &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=The Guardian |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through bureaucratic inertia, organizations tend to take on a life of their own beyond their formal objectives.

==Examples==
===Government===
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] has offices in almost all U.S. counties, even though only 14% of counties have valid farms or existing agricultural relevancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leininger |first=Kevin |url=http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130216/NEWS/130219663/1015/YOURVOICE |title=Doctor says he's winning the war against bureaucracy |publisher=News-Sentinel.com |date=2013-02-16 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===
The [[Boston Consulting Group]] has advised firms to cut down on bureaucratic inertia and advised firms to eliminate cruft, bloat, and redundancy in the aspects of the business which are not front-line for the consumer (i.e. the "face" of the company who the customer deals with and who the customer thinks is the value-provider of the company).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/24/symantec-overhaul-idUSL1N0ASHCM20130124 |title=UPDATE 2-Symantec CEO plans layoffs, no asset sales |publisher=Reuters |date=2013-01-23 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/editorschoice/indonesia-a-key-part-of-australias-asian-policy/570775 |title=Indonesia a Key Part of Australia’s Asian Policy |publisher=The Jakarta Globe |date=2013-02-11 |accessdate=2013-07-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416030645/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/editorschoice/indonesia-a-key-part-of-australias-asian-policy/570775# |archive-date=2013-04-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Calliope''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|aɪ|.|ə|p|iː}} {{respell|kə|LY|ə-pee}}; {{lang-grc|Καλλιόπη}}, ''Kalliopē'' "beautiful-voiced") is the [[muse]] who presides over [[eloquence]] and [[epic poetry]]; so called from the [[ecstatic]] [[harmony]] of her voice. [[Hesiod]] and [[Ovid]] called her the "Chief of all Muses."&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, Theogony 79-80. This belief in the goddess's identify, however, really cannot be proved from the text of the ''Iliad'', because there is no evidence as to the referent of θεά (goddess). Neither Kirk nor Leaf makes such a claim in their commentaries on the ''Iliad''. They simply say that she is "the Muse" (Μοῦσα). See G. S. Kirk, ed., ''Books 1–4'', vol. I in ''The Iliad: A Commentary'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), p. 51; and Walter Leaf, ed., ''Books I–XII'', vol. I of ''The Iliad''. 2nd ed. (London: Macmillan, 1900), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Calliope.jpg|thumb|Detail of painting ''The Muses Urania and Calliope'' by [[Simon Vouet]], in which she holds a copy of the ''[[Odyssey]]'']]

==Mythology==
One account says Calliope was the lover of the war god [[Ares]], and bore him several sons: [[Mygdon (son of Ares)|Mygdon]], [[Edonus]], [[Biston]], and [[Odomantus]] (or [[Odomas]]), respectively the  founders of Thracian tribes known as the [[Mygdones]], [[Edones]], [[Bistoni|Bistones]], and [[Odomantes]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Otherwise these children were attributed to her namesake Calliope, daughter of river-god [[Nestos (river)|Nestus]].

Calliope also had two famous sons, [[Orpheus]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Greek Gods'' by Hoopes And Evslin, {{ISBN|0-590-44110-8}}, {{ISBN|0-590-44110-8}}, 1995, page 77. His father was a Thracian king; his mother the muse Calliope. For a while, he lived on Parnassus with his mother and his eight beautiful aunts and there met Apollo who was courting the laughing muse Thalia. Apollo was taken with Orpheus, gave him his little golden lyre m, and taught him to play. And his mother taught him to make verses for singing.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]],&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, Library and Epitome, 2.4.9, This Linus was a brother of Orpheus; he came to Thebes and became a Theban&lt;/ref&gt; by either [[Apollo]] or the king [[Oeagrus]] of [[Thrace]]. She taught Orpheus verses for singing.&lt;ref&gt;''The Greek Gods'' by Hoopes And Evslin, {{ISBN|0-590-44110-8}}, {{ISBN|0-590-44110-8}}, 1995, page 77. His father was a Thracian king; his mother the muse Calliope. For a while, he lived on Parnassus with his mother and his eight beautiful aunts and there met Apollo who was courting the laughing muse Thalia. Apollo was taken with Orpheus, gave him his little golden lyre m, and taught him to play.  And his mother taught him to make verses for singing.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hesiod, she was also the wisest of the [[Muse]]s, as well as the most assertive. Calliope married [[Oeagrus]] close to [[Pimpleia]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Argonautica'', Book I,(ll. 23–34) First then let us name Orpheus whom once Calliope bare, it is said, wedded to Thracian Oeagrus, near the Pimpleian height. Men say that he by the music of his songs charmed the stubborn rocks upon the mountains and the course of rivers. And the wild oak-trees to this day, tokens of that magic strain, that grow at Zone on the Thracian shore, stand in ordered ranks close together, the same which under the charm of his lyre he led down from Pieria."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]]. She is said to have defeated the daughters of [[Pierus (king of Macedonia)|Pierus]], king of Thessaly, in a singing match, and then, to punish their presumption, turned them into magpies. (see Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 5.294–340, 662–78)

She was sometimes believed to be [[Homer]]'s muse for the [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]].{{cn|date=November 2015}} The Roman epic poet, [[Virgil]], invokes her in the [[Aeneid]] (9.525). In some cases, she is said to be the Mother of [[sirens (mythology)|sirens]].

==Depictions==
Calliope is usually seen with a writing tablet in her hand. At times, she is depicted carrying a roll of paper or a book or wearing a gold crown. She would also be seen with her children.

The Italian poet, [[Dante Alighieri]], in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', refers to Calliope:
{{poemquote|Here rise to life again, dead poetry!
Let it, O holy Muses, for I am yours,
And here Calliope, strike a higher key,
Accompanying my song with that sweet air
which made the wretched Magpies feel a blow
that turned all hope of pardon to despair|Dante, "Purgatorio", Canto I, lines 7 to 12}}

'''Castell Bryn Gwyn''' is a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] site on the [[Isle of Anglesey]], west of [[Brynsiencyn]]. It is a circular clay and gravel bank covered with grass, still some 1.5m high and revetted externally by stone walls, which surround a level area some 54 metres in diameter. Its [[Welsh placenames|name]] means "White Hill Castle".{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The original use of this site is uncertain although it may have been a religious sanctuary. Later Neolithic pottery indicates use in this period, and it may have been a [[henge]] monument at this time. The earliest bank and ditch belong to the end of the neolithic period (2500-2000 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Cadw sign at the site&lt;/ref&gt; During the Iron Age, the present wall was built, and it was refortified in Roman times and later.&lt;ref name="Cyfeillion Ymddiriedolaeth Archaeolegol Gwynedd 2009. pp 32-33"&gt;Cyfeillion Ymddiriedolaeth Archaeolegol Gwynedd, Haf 2009. Friends of the Gwynedd Archaeological Trust, Summer 2009. Prehistoric Funerary and Ritual Survey, pp 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;

Parking is exiguous; the site is accessible from the [[A4080]] by a footpath. Another path follows the low ridge, southwest over stiles to the [[Bryn Gwyn stones]], or northeast, past the site of the former stone circle of Tre'r Dryw Bach, some 800 metres to [[Caer Lêb]] where it meets a minor road with limited parking space.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

'''Cochabamba''' ({{lang-ay|Quchapampa}}; {{lang-qu|Quchapanpa}}) is a city and municipality in central [[Bolivia]] in a valley in the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]]. It is the [[capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Cochabamba Department]] and the [[list of cities in Bolivia|fourth largest city in Bolivia]], with a population of 630,587 according to the [[2012 Bolivian census]].&lt;ref name=2012census/&gt; Its name is from a compound of the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] words ''qucha'' "lake" and ''[[pampa]]'', "open [[plain]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://futatraw.ourproject.org/descargas/DicQuechuaBolivia.pdf Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha] pdf{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of the city and the surrounding areas are commonly referred to as ''cochalas'' or, more formally, ''cochabambinos''.

It is known as the "City of Eternal Spring" or "The Garden City" because of its spring-like temperatures all year round. It is also known as "La Llajta," which means "town" in Quechua.

==History==
[[File:Diosas pol.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Palacio Portales built for mining magnate Simon Patiño]]

[[File:Catedral metropolitana1.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Exterior view of the Metropolitan Cathedral in Cochabamba.]]

===Pre-Inca and Inca===
The Cochabamba valley has been inhabited for thousands of years due to its fertile productive [[soil]]s and mild [[climate]]. [[Archeology|Archaeological]] evidence suggests that the initial inhabitants were of indigenous ethnic groups: [[Tiwanaku]], Tupuraya, Mojocoya, [[Omereque]], and [[Inca]] inhabited the valley at times before the Spanish arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article120410.html|title=Huayna Capac, el inca que fundó Cochabamba, por  Wilson García Mérida|first=Wilson García Mérida,Red|last=Voltaire|date=|website=voltairenet.org|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area got its name, from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] Kochaj-pampa, as part of the [[Inca]] [[civilization]]. The area was conquered by [[Topa Inca Yupanqui]] (ruled 1471-1493). His son [[Huayna Capac]] turned Cochabamba into a large production enclave or state farm to serve the Incas.  Possibly depopulated during the conquest, Huayna Capac imported 14,000 people, called [[mitima]]s, to work the land. The principal crop was [[maize]] which could not be grown in much of the high and cold heartland of the Inca Empire. The maize was stored in 2,400 storehouses ([[qollqa]]s) in the hills overlooking the valley or transported by [[llama]] caravan to storage sites in [[Paria, Bolivia|Paria]], [[Cusco]], of other Inca administrative centers.  Most of the maize was probably used to sustain the Inca army during its campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;D'Altroy, Terence N. (2003), ''The Incas'', Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, pp 268-173; La Lone, Mary B. and La Lone, Darrell E. (1987), "The Inca State in the Southern Highlands: State Administrative and Production Enclaves," ''Ethnohistory'', pp. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish and Bolivian===
The first Spanish inhabitant of the valley was Garci Ruiz de Orellana in 1542. He purchased the majority of the land from local tribal chiefs Achata and Consavana through a title registered in 1552 at the Imperial City of [[Potosí]]. The price paid was 130 pesos. His residence, known as the House of Mayorazgo, stands in the Cala Cala neighborhood.

The city, called Villa de Oropesa, was founded on 2 August 1571 by order of [[Viceroy]] [[Francisco de Toledo, Count of Oropesa]]. It was to be an agricultural production centre to provide food and wood&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/bolivia/the-southwest/cochabamba/history|title=History of Cochabamba - Lonely Planet Travel Information|last=Planet|first=Lonely|website=www.lonelyplanet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the mining towns of the relatively nearby [[Altiplano]] region, particularly [[Potosí]] which became one of the largest and richest cities in the world during the 16th and 17th centuries &amp;mdash; funding the vast wealth that ultimately made Spain a world power. In fact, Anthropologist Jack Weatherford and others have cited the city of Potosí as the birth of capitalism because of the money it and materialism it provided Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/world/americas/for-miners-increasing-risk-on-a-mountain-at-the-heart-of-bolivias-identity.html|title=For Miners, Increasing Risk on a Mountain at the Heart of Bolivia’s Identity|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, with the [[silver mining]] industry in Potosi at its height, Cochabamba thrived during its first centuries. However, the city entered a period of decline during the 18th century as mining began to wane.

In 1786, King [[Charles III of Spain]] renamed the city to the 'loyal and valiant' Villa of Cochabamba. This was done to commend the city's pivotal role in suppressing the indigenous rebellions of 1781 in [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]] by sending armed forces to Oruro to quell the uprisings. Since the late 19th century it has again been generally successful as an agricultural centre for Bolivia.

The 1793 census shows that the city had a population of 22,305 persons. There were 12,980 [[mestizos]], 6,368 Spaniards, 1,182 indigenous natives, 1,600 [[mulattos]] and 175 African [[slave]]s.

In 1812, Cochabamba was the site of a riot against the Spanish Army. On May 27, thousands of women took up arms against the Spanish. According to historian Nathaniel Aguirre: "From Cochabamba, many men have fled. Not one woman. On the hillside, a great clamor. Cochabamba's plebeian women, at bay, fight from the center of a circle of fire. Surrounded by five thousand Spaniards, they resist with battered tin guns and a few arquebuses; and they fight to the last yell, whose echoes will resound throughout the long war for independence. Whenever his army weakens, General Manuel Belgrano will shout those words which never fail to restore courage and spark anger. The general will ask his vacillating soldiers: '''Are the women of Cochabamba present?''"&lt;ref&gt;Juan de la Rosa by Nathaniel Aguirre&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate their bravery, Bolivia now marks May 27 as Mother's Day.&lt;ref&gt;Memory of Fire Vol 2: Faces and Masks by Eduardo Galeano p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, the population was 21,886.

Besides a number of schools and charitable institutions, the diocese has 55 parishes, 80 churches and chapels, and 160 priests.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In 1998, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed to give Bolivia a loan of $138 million to control inflation and promote economic growth. However, it only agreed to do so on the condition that Bolivia sell "all remaining public enterprises," including its national oil refineries and the local water company, SEMAPA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/bolivia/timeline.html|title=FRONTLINE/WORLD .

Then in 2000, the people of Cochabamba began to protest as water priced hiked to a 50% increase that the majority could not afford.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nacla.org/blog/2013/6/5/water-wars-water-scarcity-bolivia%25E2%2580%2599s-cautionary-tale|title=From Water Wars to Water Scarcity: Bolivia’s Cautionary Tale|website=NACLA|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition for the Defense of Water and Life, and its leader Oscar Olivera, started a demonstration in ''La Plaza 14 de Septiembre'' also known as ''La Plaza Principal.'' The march was meant to be peaceful, but after two days the police used tear gas against the protestors and injured about 175 people and blinded two. Soon after, news reports were  made about the protests and the violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Defense of Water and Life held an unofficial referendum and 96% of 50,000 people want Aguas del Tunari's contract to terminate, but the government refused. The protests only grew and the entire world began to watch forcing Bechtel to leave its contract and return SEMAPA to the public. Bechtel as well tried to sue the Bolivian government for $50 million but it withdrew its claim shortly after.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This event was soon labeled the Water Wars and became a driving force for anti-globalization projects such as the UN's decision to make water sanitation a human right and privatization of water as unethical in 2010. Additionally, the Water Wars would help spark the next revolt against the privatization of natural gases in 2003 to 2005 that would lead to the removal of two presidents and the rise of President Evo Morales in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/15/business/who-will-bring-water-to-the-bolivian-poor.html|title=Who Will Bring Water to the Bolivian Poor?|last=Forero|first=Juan|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007 city dwellers clashed with mostly rural protestors, leaving four dead and over 130 injured. The first democratically elected Prefect of Cochabamba, [[Manfred Reyes Villa]], had allied himself with the leaders of Bolivia's Eastern Departments in a dispute with President [[Evo Morales]] over regional autonomy and other political issues. The protestors blockaded the [[highway]]s, bridges, and main roads, having days earlier set fire to the departmental seat of government, trying to force the resignation of Reyes Villa. Citizens attacked the protestors, breaking the blockade and routing them, while the police did little to stop the violence. Further attempts by the protestors to reinstate the blockade and threaten the government were unsuccessful, but the underlying tensions have not been resolved.

In July 2007, a monument erected by veterans of January's protest movement in honor of those killed and injured by government supporters was destroyed in the middle of the night, reigniting racial conflicts in the city.

In August 2008, a nationwide referendum was held. The prefect of Cochabamba, Manfred Reyes Villa, was not confirmed by the voters of the department.

==Climate==
Cochabamba's famous "Eternal Spring" continues to hold sway over the hearts of true Cochalos. Neither experiencing the humid heat of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]] nor the frigid winds of [[La Paz]], Cochabamba enjoys a [[cold semi-arid climate|semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: BSk). The characteristic of the climate is an extended dry season that runs from May until October with a wet season that generally begins in November with the principal rains ending in March.

Cochabamba is known as the heart of Bolivia and the gastronomic capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.escuelacarmenvega.com/site/index.php/en/cochabamba-ing/la-ciudad-de-cochabamba-2|title=Spanish school Carmen Vega Bolivia|website=Escuela de español Carmen Vega - Cochabamba- Bolivia.|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional cuisine includes: salteñas, chuño, tucumanas, pique macho, silpancho, anticucho, sopa de mani, chicharrón, and many more dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/bolivia/articles/the-best-traditional-foods-you-need-to-try-on-your-trip-to-bolivia/|title=The Best Traditional Foods You Need to Try on Your Trip to Bolivia|last=Stewart|first=Harry|work=Culture Trip|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commensurate with other large cities in the Andean highlands of South America, Cochabamba is a city of contrasts. Its central commercial districts, bounded by [https://web.archive.org/web/20080621061547/http://www.cbba.info/karte/mymapa.php?aktmuni=7&amp;aktanzeige=lugar&amp;aktlugar=2 Plaza Colón] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080115102335/http://www.cbba.info/karte/mymapa.php?aktmuni=7&amp;aktanzeige=lugar&amp;aktlugar=1 Plaza 14 de Septiembre], are generally equipped with modern urban amenities and are where the majority of the city's formal business and commercial industries are based. La Cancha, the largest open air market in South America, is also an active place where locals can buy a range of items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://amizade.org/la-cancha-an-exuberant-marketplace-experience-in-bolivia/|title=La Cancha: An Exuberant Marketplace Experience in Bolivia on Amizade|last=Moore|first=Dillon|website=Amizade|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; An active nightlife is centered around [https://web.archive.org/web/20090106214155/http://www.cbba.info/karte/mymapa.php?aktanzeige=calle&amp;aktcalle=3 Calle España] and along the broad, tree-lined boulevard, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090107015853/http://www.cbba.info/karte/mymapa.php?aktanzeige=calle&amp;aktcalle=28 El Prado]. In contrast, the remote area adjacent to the Wilstermann International [[Airport]] is visibly impoverished, with adobe homes and unpaved roads, which is often the first impression visitors acquire while commuting into the city.

In 2009, the government under President Evo Morales created a new constitution that declared Spanish and 36 other indigenous languages as the official languages of the country.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bolivia/Languages-and-religion|title=Bolivia - Languages and religion|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most widely spoken languages in Cochabamba are Spanish and Quechua. Although the Spanish that is spoken in the Cochabamba region is generally regarded as rather conservative in its phonetics and vocabulary, the use of Quechua terminology (''wawa'' [child] and ''wistupiku'' [mouth or twist lips]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wistupiku.com/nuestra-familia/|title=Wistupiku   –  Nuestra familia|website=www.wistupiku.com|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has been widely incorporated into its standardized form.

As with most cities around the globe, English language is increasingly spoken and understood, particularly among business-minded indigenous and repatriated Cochabambinos. English-language instruction has become incorporated into some private schools and universities, but is not taught universally, therefore a vast majority of the population does not speak English.

About four-fifths of the population of Bolivia identifies as Catholic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The city's demographics consist of the following visible groups in order of prevalence: Western Hemispheric indigenous (mostly of [[Quechua people|Quechua]] and [[Aymara people|Aymara]] ethnicity), [[Mestizo]] or mixed Indigenous, and a minority of white [[Caucasoid]] and mixed white ([[Criollo (people)|Criollos]]).

==Government==
Cochabamba, formally the municipality of Cercado, is the [[Capital city|capital]] of [[Cochabamba department]]. The city government is divided into [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislature|legislative]] branches. The mayor of Cochabamba is the head of the city government, elected by general election for a term of five years. The mayor heads an executive branch, which includes six sub-mayors and a variety of departments comprising 950 functionaries.&lt;ref name=MiCompromiso&gt;{{Cite news| last = Jordán Arandia| first = Oscar E.| title = Mi compromiso es con Cochabamba| work = Los Tiempos| location = Cochabamba| accessdate = 2010-06-02| date = 2010-05-30| url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/local/20100530/mi-compromiso-es-con-cochabamba_73040_135646.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110929030601/http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/local/20100530/mi-compromiso-es-con-cochabamba_73040_135646.html| archive-date = 2011-09-29| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 11-member municipal council is the legislative branch.

The current mayor is José María Leyes of the Social Democrat Movement (MDS for its initials in Spanish).

==Economy==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
The area where Cochabamba is situated is commonly referred to as the granary of Bolivia. Its climate is milder than that of the Altiplano region to the west and thus permits extensive agriculture, including grains, potatoes, and coffee in the highlands and sugar cane, [[cocoa bean]]s, tobacco, and fruit in the Chapare tropical lowlands, an area that had been one of the country's main [[coca]]-leaf-producing regions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Cochabamba is also the industrial hub of Bolivia, producing [[Automobile|cars]], cleaning products, cosmetics, chemicals, and other items like cement. The economy of Cochabamba is characterized by produce goods and services. Recently, the software industry is becoming important with one big company (Jalasoft [http://www.jalasoft.com/about]) and several small software developers.

==Education==
[[File:Univalle Campus Tiquipaya.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Universidad del Valle]]
The city is the home of the [[University of San Simón]] (UMSS, for "Universidad Mayor de San Simón"), one of the largest and most prominent public universities in Bolivia. UMSS is the second best university in Bolivia according to QS World University Rankings in 2013, but measured by the webmetric scores as the first one during 2013-2017. Among the private universities in Bolivia ranking between the top ten are the Universidad Privada Boliviana (a prestigious business university), Universidad del Valle (strong university in medicine with large enrollment of international students) and  Universidad Católica Boliviana "San Pablo". Other well-ranked universities includes Escuela Militar de Ingenieria "Antonio Jose de Sucre", Universidad Simón I. Patiño, Universidad de Aquino Bolivia, Universidad Adventista de Bolivia, Universidad Privada Domingo Savio and Universidad Privada Abierta Latinoamericana (UPAL). Cochabamba became the second recipient city of Brazilians student in Bolivia after the city of Santa Cruz due to the affordable and good living conditions of the city.
Also is the home of one of the best schools of Bolivia, [[Colegio San Agustín (Cochabamba)|Colegio San Agustín]]

==Airport==
Cochabamba is served by the modern [[Jorge Wilstermann International Airport]] ([[IATA]] code CBB), which handles domestic and international flights. It houses the headquarters of [[Boliviana de Aviación]] ([[Boliviana de Aviación|BOA]]) Bolivia's national airline and [[Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano]], Bolivia's former national airline. Other domestic airlines that serve the airport include Amaszonas, Ecojet, and Transportes Aéreo Militar.

==Neighborhoods==
Cochabamba is a steadily emerging market within the Bolivian [[real estate]] industry. Since 2010, it became the city with most surface area in construction in Bolivia overpassing Santa Cruz and La Paz.  There are many middle and large buildings under construction by 2012. An annual mild climate, abundant greenery, mountain vistas, and a progressive local economy are factors that have contributed to the city's appeal for Bolivian nationals, expatriates and foreigners alike. Historic and affluent neighbourhoods such as Cala Cala, El Mirador, and Lomas de Aranjuez showcase some of the city's most distinguished residences.

==Additional notes of interest==
* Cochabamba is also mentioned in the documentary ''[[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'', about their fight against privatisation of water by a foreign-owned company. The people protested against this and won. The privatisation had gone to such an extent that even rain water was not allowed to be collected. Read [[Cochabamba protests of 2000]].
* Cochabamba has been confirmed to be the seat of a future [[South American Parliament]] when it is formed by [[UNASUR]]. UNASUR has yet to determine what the composition of the Parliament will be, but existing treaties all agree it will meet in Cochabamba.
* Cochabamba was the first place [[rugby union in Bolivia]] was formally established.
* Cochabamba was featured as a location in the story in the 1983 film, ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''. Powerful drug lord Alejandro Sosa resided there, governed large coca plantations and owned cocaine labs where upon further refining, would be shipped to Tony Montana in Florida.
* Cochabamba is the setting of the 2010 movie ''[[También la Lluvia|También la lluvia]]'' (''Even the rain''), which takes place during the water war of 2000. It depicts a team making a movie about the colonization of Latin America, when the protests against privatization arise. The star is Mexican actor [[Gael García Bernal]], and the film has received good criticism.
* Cochabamba is also the site of several major spam operators, as confirmed by the watchdog group Spamhaus.&lt;ref&gt;Spamhaus Blacklist, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration==
Historically, Cochabamba has been a destination for many Bolivians due to relatively improved economic opportunities and a more temperate climate. Bolivia's current President [[Evo Morales]] and ex-president [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] were both Senators representing Cochabamba, although they were born in [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]] and [[La Paz]] respectively and immigrated to Cochabamba at the start of their political careers.

After the road to the eastern city of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] was completed in the 1950s, thousands of people from Cochabamba migrated to the lowlands and permanently settled. Many migrants from Cochabamba and their descendants now identify themselves as [[Camba]]s after absorbing the regional Bolivian culture of the eastern lowlands, but maintain familiar ties with relatives that remained in Cochabamba.

A large population of Bolivian and Bolivian-descended residents is in the Greater Washington, D.C.-[[Baltimore]]&amp;ndash;[[Northern Virginia]] area of United States (2005 US Census estimates 27,452 +/- 8,883 Bolivians for DC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US11&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2005_EST_G2000_B03001|publisher=US Census Bureau|title=2005 American Community Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US51&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2005_EST_G2000_B03001|publisher=US Census Bureau|title=2005 American Community Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Maryland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US24&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2005_EST_G2000_B03001|publisher=US Census Bureau|title=2005 American Community Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;); the highest concentration is in [[Arlington County]], [[Virginia]]. These figures may represent a census undercount of undocumented Bolivian alien residents. These combined communities have become the centre for recent and established Bolivian immigrants, most of whom are from the department and city of Cochabamba, hence, locally regarded as ''Little Cochabamba'' or ''Arlibamba''. Little Cochabamba contains Bolivian-cuisine restaurants and the Escuela Bolivia; a school-within-a-school programme for children and adults.

After to the mid-1990s, many people from Cochabamba with a low income emigrated to [[Bergamo]], Italy in search of work. Most of the 16,400 (2005 estimate) Bolivians in Bergamo are from Cochabamba which includes both legal and work visa-expired immigrants. This migration is due to the strong relationship between the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bergamo]] and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cochabamba|Archdiocese of Cochabamba]].

'''Double consciousness''' is a term describing the internal conflict experienced by subordinated groups in an oppressive society. It was coined by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] with reference to African American "double consciousness," including his own, and published in the [[Autoethnography|autoethnographic]] work, ''The Souls of Black Folk''.&lt;ref name="db"&gt;Du Bois, W. E. B. The Souls of Black Folk. New York, Avenel, NJ: Gramercy Books; 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The term originally referred to the psychological challenge of "always looking at one's self through the eyes" of a racist white society, and "measuring oneself by the means of a nation that looked back in contempt". The term also referred to Du Bois' experiences of reconciling his African heritage with an upbringing in a European-dominated society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wamba|first=Philippe|title=Kinship|year=1999|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-525-94387-7|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has since been applied to numerous situations of social inequality, notably women living in patriarchal societies.

== Explanation==
The term originated from an article of Du Bois's titled "Strivings of the Negro People", published in the August 1897 issue of the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1897/08/strivings-of-the-negro-people/305446/|title=Strivings of the negro people|last=Du Bois|first=W. E. B.|date=August 1897|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later republished and slightly edited under the title "Of Our Spiritual Strivings" in his book, ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]''. Du Bois describes double consciousness as follows:

{{quote|It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his two-ness,—an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.

The history of the American Negro is the history of this strife{{spnd}}this longing to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double self into a better and truer self. In this merging he wishes neither of the older selves to be lost. He does not wish to Africanize America, for America has too much to teach the world and Africa. He wouldn't bleach his Negro blood in a flood of white Americanism, for he knows that Negro blood has a message for the world. He simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an American without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows, without having the doors of opportunity closed roughly in his face.&lt;ref name="db"/&gt;}}

The idea of double consciousness was important because it illuminated the experiences of black folks living in a world post-slavery, and it set a framework for understanding the positionality of oppressed people in an oppressive world. As a result, it became used to explain the dynamics of gender, colonialism, xenophobia and more alongside race. This theory laid a strong foundation for other critical theorists to expand upon.

==Gilroy and the Black Atlantic==
[[Paul Gilroy]] used theories of culture and race to the study and construction of African American intellectual history. He is known especially for marking a turning point in the study of the African diasporas.&lt;ref name=Chivallon239&gt;Chivallon, Christine. "Beyond Gilroy's Black Atlantic: The Experience of the [[African Diaspora]]". ''Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies'', Vol. 11, Issue 3 (Winter 2002): pp. 359–382 (p. 359).&lt;/ref&gt; His book "The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness" (1993) introduces the Black Atlantic as a source for cultural construction.&lt;ref name="Braziel 2006, pp49"&gt;Braziel, Jana Evans and Mannur, Anita. ''Theorizing Diaspora''. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2006, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Gilroy pioneers a shift in contemporary black studies by arguing that we should reject the notion of a homogeneous nation-state based nationality in favor of analyzing "the Atlantic as one single, complex unit of analysis in their discussions of the modern world and use it to produce an explicitly transnational and intercultural perspective".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The black Atlantic : modernity and double consciousness|last=1956-|first=Gilroy, Paul|isbn=9780860914013|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=28112279|year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; He based this on the Atlantic slave trade and marked it as the foundation for the diaspora. He recognized the significance of European and African transnational travel as a foundation for double consciousness. Gilroy used Du Bois' theory of double consciousness to suggest there exists an internal struggle to reconcile being both European and Black, which was his main focus in Black Atlantic.&lt;ref name="Braziel 2006, pp49"/&gt; He even characterized the Black Atlantic by the influence of slave trade "routes" on black identity. He aimed to unify black culture with the connection to the homeland as well the cultural exchanges that occurred afterward. He was also influential in the political black British movement, in which he popularized his theories.&lt;ref&gt;Shukra, Kalbir. "The Death of a Black Political Movement", ''Community Development Journal'', Vol. 32, No. 3 (July 1997): p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilroy argues that occupying the space between these two dialectally subjectivities is "viewed as a provocative and even oppositional act of political insubordination".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that for Black people across Diaspora, thinking of the duality in their identity as one is almost paradoxical and conceptualizing and actualizing this is a move of symbolic resistance in modernity.

==Franz Fanon and double consciousness==
Very similarly to Du Bois, Franz Fanon touched upon the term of Double Consciousness in his life. In his first book, Black Skin, White Masks, where he expressed his hopelessness at being neither white nor black. Fanon identifies the double consciousness that African Americans face and its source; he claimed the cultural and social confusions of African Americans were caused by European culture.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, T. Owens (2005). "A Fanonian Perspective on Double Consciousness". Journal of Black Studies. 35 (6): 751–762.
.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave examples of things that he has encountered that demonstrate the double consciousness. He talks about people who preach about completely conforming to being white and says that they are wrong. He also says that the people who believe that complete rejection of whites are also wrong.&lt;ref name="Fanon, Frantz 2008"&gt;1925-1961., Fanon, Frantz, (2008). Black skin, white masks (1st ed., New ed ed.). New York: Grove Press. {{ISBN|0802143008}}. OCLC 71286732.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then proceeds to talk about why the African American adopts cultures that are so strange to him. He talks about how when an African American leaves for Europe, they come back speaking a language different from their own. He also talks about how African, mostly the wealthiest, tend to have insecurities of not being European enough because they are African. This manifests in buying European furniture and buying European clothes.&lt;ref name="Fanon, Frantz 2008"/&gt;

In addition to this he talks about the way white men talk to African Americans and how it contributes to this problem of double consciousness. He says that when a white man talks to an African American man he is changing his language to a way in which a stereotypical black man would talk, similarly to how one would talk to a child, with different language sophistication and slang. He says that this angers the African American because he feels as though he has been categorized and imprisoned into a box from which he cannot escape due to this judgement. He gives an example of a film where this stereotype is portrayed and then talks about how African Americans need to be educated to not follow the stereotypes displayed by white culture.&lt;ref&gt;1925-1961., Fanon, Frantz, (2008). Black skin, white masks (1st ed., New ed ed.). New York: Grove Press. {{ISBN|0802143008}}. OCLC 71286732&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Greenblatt]] also uses it to describe the peculiar quality of Shakespeare's consciousness in his biography of the bard, ''Will in the World'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nehring|first1=Cristina|title=Shakespeare in Love, or in Context|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/12/shakespeare-in-love-or-in-context/303617/|accessdate=30 April 2017|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Triple Consciousness ==
Within the last fifteen years, DuBois' theory of double consciousness has been revisited to develop a more inclusive concept of triple consciousness. This triple consciousness may include another intersecting identity that impacts someone's social experiences. Additional identities that may affect the already present double consciousness experience might include ethnicity or gender. For example, [[Juan Flores (professor)|Juan Flores]] identified ethnicity as a potential aspect that influences double consciousness by speculating Afro-Latinos in the U.S. experienced an added layer discrimination that combined skin color with ethnicity and nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/85cf0c77df15bc880c17e304d53e1f3e/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=16826|title=Triple Consciousness? Afro-Latinos on the Color Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna J. Cooper|Anna Julia Cooper]] similarly references the intersectionality of race and gender within her work ''A Voice from the South'' where she states: "Only the black woman can say 'when and where I enter, in the quiet, undisputed dignity of my womanhood, without violence and without suing or special patronage, then and there the whole ... race enters with me".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/cooper/cooper.html|title=Anna J. Cooper (Anna Julia), 1858-1964. A Voice from the South.|website=docsouth.unc.edu|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Jossianna Arroyo explains that triple consciousness brings "spaces, culture, and skin ... [to] recontextualize blackness"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Roots" or the virtualities of racial imaginaries in Puerto Rico and the diaspora|journal=Latino Studies|volume=8|issue=2|pages=195–219|doi=10.1057/lst.2010.17|year = 2010|last1 = Arroyo|first1 = Jossianna}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of black Puerto Ricans.

==Double consciousness for women of color==

Just like any other thought in critical race analysis, double consciousness theory cannot be divorced from gender. This is where black feminists have introduced their concept of the triple consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beyondblackwhite.com/triple-consciousness-black-woman/|title=Triple Consciousness and the Black Woman - Beyond Black &amp; White|website=Beyond Black &amp; White|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-24|date=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black women not only have to see themselves through the lens of blackness and whiteness, but also through the lens of patriarchy. Whenever they are in black spaces, women still have to situate themselves in the context of patriarchy. Whenever that they are in fem spaces, they must still situate themselves in the context of their blackness. Deborah Gray White puts it best when she writes, "African American women are confronted with an impossible task. If she is rescued from the myth of the negro, the myth of the woman traps her. If she escapes the myth of the women, the myth of the negro still ensnares her".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hercampus.com/school/hampton-u/double-consciousness-black-woman|title=The Double Consciousness of a Black Woman|work=Her Campus|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the double burdens that feminists faced was fighting for women's' rights as well as rights for people of color. [[Frances M. Beale]] wrote that the situation of black women was full of misconceptions and distortions of the truth. In her pamphlet ''Double Jeopardy: To Be Black and Female'', she claimed that capitalism was the direct forebearer of racism because the system was indirectly a way to destroy the humanity of black people.&lt;ref&gt;''Beale, Francis M. Double Jeopardy: To Be Black and Female. Double Jeopardy: To Be Black and Female.''&lt;/ref&gt;

"In any society where men are not yet free, women are less free because we are further enslaved because we [African American women] are enslaved by our sex." Many African American women turned towards feminism in their fight against oppression because "there was an awareness that they were being treated as second-class citizens within the Civil Right's movement of the 60's." Due to this many women felt that they were being asked to choose between "a Black movement that primarily served the interest of Black male patriarchs and a women's movement which primarily served the interests of racist white women."

==Black Power==
The first portion of Black Power labeled "White Power" by Kwame Ture (formerly known as Stokely Carmichael) and Charles V. Hamilton provides evidence backing up the ideology of double consciousness in regards to blacks in the United States. The book opens up by defining racism as "the predication of decisions and policies on considerations of race for the purpose of subordinating a racial group and maintaining control over that group" (Hamilton &amp; Ture, 3). Therefore the subordinating group, blacks, must think of themselves in terms of the oppressive population, white. Individual racism and institutional racism both contribute to double consciousness. On an individual level double consciousness is practiced within every day interactions and on an institutional level it impacts how blacks function throughout society. "Black People are legal citizens of the United States with, for the most part, the same legal rights as other citizens. Yet they stand as colonial subjects in relations to the with society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black power: the politics of liberation in America|last=Carmichael|first=Stokely|last2=Hamilton|first2=Charles V.|publisher=Vintage Books|others=|year=1992|isbn=9780679743132|edition= Vintage|location=New York|pages=6|oclc=26096713}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, while the black population in the United States are essentially equal to whites under written law, there remains deeply rooted inequities between the races and therefore reinforce double consciousness. Because these differences are not evident under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, they are an experience.

== Double consciousness in the Afro-German paradigm ==
Even though the framework of double consciousness can be applied to Diaspora and Transnationality, it is important to understand that the nuances of racial dynamics differ from nation to nation. As [[Tina Campt]] notes in ''Other Germans: Black Germans and the Politics of Race, Gender, and Memory in the Third Reich,'' the tension for Afro-German who "came of age during the totalitarian regime of the Third Reich ... was not necessarily experienced as one of absolute duality or 'twoness.' Rather, it was a contradictory and complexly textured form of identity ...".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Other Germans : Black Germans and the politics of race, gender, and memory in the Third Reich|last=1964-|first=Campt, Tina|date=2005, ©2004|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472031382|edition= 1st paperback|location=Ann Arbor|oclc=606925042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the absence of a presence of a Black community in Germany, along with other European nations, "most Afro-Germans did not have the option of choosing between a Black community or identity and a German identity".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They were essentially forced to "occupy a position between a conception of German identity that excluded blackness and a conception of blackness that precluded any identification with Germanness".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This means that for them, the psychological dilemmas that come with double consciousness is even more profound. For Black Germans in the early 20th century, there was no stable idea or community of blackness for them to identify, or partly, with. They were constantly subject to the white gaze and had no stable line of flight away from white civil society.

{{PoeTopics}}

The works of American author [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (January 19, 1809&amp;nbsp;– October 7, 1849) include many [[poetry|poems]], [[short story|short stories]], and one [[novel]]. His fiction spans multiple genres, including [[horror fiction]], [[adventure novel|adventure]], [[science fiction]], and [[detective fiction]], a genre he is credited with inventing.&lt;ref name=Silverman171&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works are generally considered part of the [[Dark romanticism]] movement, a literary reaction to [[Transcendentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koster|2002|p=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe's writing reflects his literary theories: he disagreed with [[didacticism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kagle|1990|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[allegory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poe|1847|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning in literature, he said in his criticism, should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface; works whose meanings are too obvious cease to be art.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilbur|1967|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe pursued originality in his works, and disliked proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2002|pp=445–465}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often included elements of popular [[pseudoscience]]s such as [[phrenology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hungerford|1930|pp=209–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[physiognomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grayson|2005|pp=56–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of [[premature burial]], the reanimation of the dead, and [[mourning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1987|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though known as a masterly practitioner of [[Gothic fiction]], Poe did not invent the genre; he was following a long-standing popular tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fisher|2002|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poe's literary career began in 1827 with the release of 50 copies of ''[[Tamerlane and Other Poems]]'' credited only to "a Bostonian", a collection of early poems that received virtually no attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1829, Poe released ''Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems'' in [[Baltimore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; before delving into [[short story|short stories]] for the first time with "[[Metzengerstein]]" in 1832.&lt;ref name=Silverman88&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most successful and most widely read prose during his lifetime was "[[The Gold-Bug]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; which earned him a $100 prize, the most money he received for a single work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoffman|1998|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most important works, "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]", was published in 1841 and is today considered the first modern detective story.&lt;ref name="Meyers, 123"&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe called it a "tale of [[wikt:ratiocination|ratiocination]]".&lt;ref name=Silverman171/&gt; Poe became a household name with the publication of "[[The Raven]]" in 1845,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoffman|1998|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was not a financial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krutch|1926|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publishing industry at the time was a difficult career choice and much of Poe's work was written using themes specifically catered for mass market tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whalen|2001|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Der Eiserne Mann Closeup.jpg|thumb|Iron Man closeup.]]

'''''Der Eiserne Mann''''' (The Iron Man) is an old [[iron]] pillar partially buried in the ground in the [[Germany|German]] national forest of [[Kottenforst-Ville Nature Park]], about two kilometers north-east of the village Dünstekoven. It is a roughly rectangular metal bar with about 1.18 m above ground and approximately 1 m below ground&lt;!-- Dimensions altered to match those of sign. --&gt;. The pillar is currently located at a meeting of trails which were built in the early 18th century through the formerly pathless forest area, but it is believed to have stood in another nearby location before that time.

The pillar is a unique oddity in [[Central Europe]], and is alleged by some to be an [[out-of-place artifact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fuß |first1=Hans-Peter |title=So Klaus Grewe released the Iron Man in Kottenforst |url=http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/ga-erlebniswelt/ga-events/wandertag/So-legte-Klaus-Grewe-den-Eisernen-Mann-im-Kottenforst-frei-article3924505.html |website=General Anzeiger |accessdate=21 November 2018 |language=German |date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first mentioned in a 17th-century document, where it was used as a village [[boundary marker]]. There are some old aqueducts in the vicinity along with an ancient stone walkway. 

A metallurgical investigation in the 1970s showed that the pillar is made of [[pig iron]]. It was poured into an earthen trench, consistent with medieval methods of ironworking.&lt;REF&gt;Grewe, Klaus. ''Der Eiserne Mann im Kottenforst''. Rheinlandverlag, Cologne, 1978.&lt;/REF&gt;

After the long exposure to the weather, the iron man shows signs of weathering but there is remarkably little trace of rust. It is located at 50.70757° N by 6.96105° E at an elevation of approximately 159 m.

==Sign content==
The pillar is marked with a sign reading, in translation:
{{quote|The Iron Man is a piece of a poured pig iron ingot. It is approximately 2.18 meters long and about 1 meter of its T-shaped end is in the ground. This was apparently intended as an attachment point for transport and processing and has until now, as an anchoring point, prevented any attempt at removing the ingot by force. Its porous surface and the uneven cross-section over its whole length are caused by the sandbed pouring technique. The technique and the form point to a date of manufacture in the late Middle Ages.

Origin and original purpose of the Iron Man have not been explained satisfactorily. It has always been surrounded by numerous tales and legends as well as pertinent and also obscure speculation. It was first mentioned in a document in 1625 as part of the border line between Alfter and Heimerzheim along the Roman aqueduct. According to a later source, it still fulfilled this function in 1717. Its former position can not be located accurately any more. It was not until 1727, under Prince Elector Clemens that the Iron Man was placed in its present position. It served as a marker of the main planning line while expanding the system of paths for hunting between Augustsburg Palace in Brühl and Herzogsfreude Palace in Röttgen. Today it is a popular meeting point among hikers.|Heimat- und Verschönerungsverein Buschhoven e. V.

{{IPA notice}}
In [[linguistics]], '''fortis''' and '''lenis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɔr|t|ɪ|s|_|ˈ|l|iː|n|ɪ|s}}; [[Latin]] for "strong" and "weak"), sometimes identified with [[Tenseness|'''tense''' and '''lax''']], are pronunciations of [[consonant]]s with relatively greater and lesser energy. [[English language|English]] has fortis consonants, such as the ''p'' in ''pat'', with a corresponding lenis consonant, such as the ''b'' in ''bat''. Fortis and lenis consonants may be distinguished by [[tenseness]] or other characteristics, such as [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]], [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]], [[glottalization]], [[velarization]], [[consonant length|length]], and length of nearby vowels. Fortis and lenis were coined for languages where the contrast between sounds such as ''p'' and ''b'' does not involve [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] (vibration of the [[vocal folds|vocal cord]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=95}}, pointing to {{Harvcoltxt|Halle|Hughes|Radley|1957}} as an example&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, the terms were used to refer to an impressionistic sense of strength differences, though more sophisticated instruments eventually gave the opportunity to search for the acoustic and articulatory signs.  For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Malécot|1968}} tested whether articulatory strength could be detected by measuring the force of the contact between the [[Manner of articulation|articulators]] or of the peak pressure in the mouth.  Because such studies initially found little to substantiate the terminology, phoneticians have largely ceased using them, though they are still commonly used as "phonological labels for specifying a dichotomy when used language-specifically."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=95, 98}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Catford|1977}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Jaeger|1983}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Elugbe|1980}} as examples.&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be useful when the actual articulatory features underlying the distinction are unknown, under-researched or unimportant.

==Characteristics==
{| cellpadding="1" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #88a; background-color: #f7f8ff; padding: 5px; font-size: 0.9em; margin: 0 0 15px 10px; "

|-
|0 [[Tenuis consonant|Tenuis]]

|}

Later studies have shown that articulatory strength is not completely irrelevant.  The articulators in the mouth can move with a greater velocity&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Smith|McLean-Muse|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or with higher [[electromyography|electromyographic]] activation levels of the relevant articulatory muscles&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Slis|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; with fortis consonants than with lenis ones.

Generally, voiceless stops have greater oral pressure than voiced ones, which could explain this greater articulatory energy.   In [[Ewe language|Ewe]], for example, the lips reach closure faster in articulating {{IPA|/p/}} than in {{IPA|/b/}}, making the lip closure longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These differences in oral articulatory energy in consonants of different laryngeal settings is fairly widespread, though the correlation of energy and voicing is not universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, a number of languages have been proposed as making strength differences independently of voicing, such as [[Tabasaran language|Tabasaran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kodzasov|Muravjeva|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archi language|Archi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kodzasov|1977|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Udi language|Udi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/didact/caucasus/nekklaut.htm#XFN10 Consonant Systems of the Northeast Caucasian Languages on TITUS DIDACTICA]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aghul language|Aghul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kodzasov|1990|pp=338–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Fortis" and "lenis" have also been used to refer to contrasts of consonant duration in languages like [[Jawoyn language|Jawoyn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jaeger|1983}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bloomfield|1956}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dalabon language|Dalabon]], [[Kunwinjku language|Kunwinjku]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Fletcher|Evans|2002|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zurich German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Fleischer|Schmid|2006|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zapotec languages]] are also considered to have contrast of length rather than of voicing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nellis|Hollenbach|1980}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Merrill|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in [[Mixe languages|Mixe]], lenis consonants are not only pronounced shorter than their fortis counterparts, but they are also prone to voicing in voiced environments, which fortis consonants are not.

This association with longer duration has prompted some to propose a diachronic link between fortis consonants and [[gemination]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Swadesh|1947}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Blevins|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Harvcoltxt|Payne|2006}} even proposes that gemination is itself a process of fortition in [[Italian language|Italian]].

In English, use of the terms "fortis" and "lenis" is useful to refer to contrasts between consonants that have different phonetic attributes depending on context.  The [[alveolar consonant]]s {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}, for example:

:{{note|flapping|a}} Depending on dialect, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} may not neutralize with [[flapping]], with the contrast manifesting itself in the preceding vowel's duration.
:{{note|s|b}} In the same syllable, the distinction between {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} is lost after {{IPA|[s]}}.

As the above table shows, no one feature is adequate to accurately reflect the contrasts in all contexts.  Word-initially, the contrast has more to do with aspiration; {{IPA|/t/}} is aspirated and {{IPA|/d/}} is an unaspirated voiceless stop.  In the syllable coda, however, {{IPA|/t/}} is instead pronounced with [[glottalization]], unrelease, and a shorter vowel while {{IPA|/d/}} remains voiceless.  In this way, the terms ''fortis'' and ''lenis'' are convenient in discussing English phonology, even if they are phonetically imprecise.

It is rare for the use of greater ''respiratory'' energy for [[segment (linguistics)|segments]] to occur in a language, though some examples do exist, such as [[Korean language|Korean]], which makes a three way contrast amongst most of its obstruents with voiceless, [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]], and a third [[faucalized voice]]d set that involves both an increase in subglottal pressure as well as greater glottal constriction and tenseness in the walls of the vocal tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Igbo language|Igbo]] has also been observed to utilize an increase in subglottal pressure involving its aspirated consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In southern German dialects, the actual distinction underlying obstruent pairs varies somewhat depending on the dialect, but is often one of length—fortis sounds are pronounced geminated in all positions in a word, even at the end of a word or before other consonants.

Many [[North Caucasian languages]] ([[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest]] and especially [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast]]) have a consonantal distinction described as "strong" or "preruptive" that has concomitant length. [[Akhvakh language|Akhvakh]] and other Northeast Caucasian languages even possess a distinction between strong/long and weak/short [[ejective consonant]]s: {{IPA|[qʼaː]}} ('soup') vs. {{IPA|[qʼːama]}} ('cock's comb')

{{Harvcoltxt|Kodzasov|1977}} describes the fortis consonants for [[Archi language|Archi]]: 
{{quote|Strong phonemes are characterized by the intensiveness (tension) of the articulation. The intensity of the pronunciation leads to a natural lengthening of the duration of the sound, and that is why strong [consonants] differ from weak ones by greater length. [However,] the adjoining of two single weak sounds does not produce a strong one […] Thus, the gemination of a sound does not by itself create its tension.&lt;ref&gt;translated in {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fortis stops in [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] such as [[Rembarunga language|Rembarunga]] (see [[Ngalakgan language|Ngalakgan]]) also involve length, with short consonants having weak contact and intermittent voicing, and long consonants having full closure, a more powerful release burst, and no voicing. It is not clear if strength makes the consonants long, or if during long consonants there is a greater opportunity for full articulation.

Articulatory strength can reinforce other distinctions. [[Ewe language|Ewe]], for example, which contrasts a [[voiceless bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|/ɸ/}} and a [[voiceless labiodental fricative]] {{IPA|/f/}}, pronounces the latter markedly more strongly than {{IPA|/f/}} in most languages.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}} This helps differentiate what would otherwise be a very subtle distinction.

==Notation==
The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] provides no specific means for representation of a fortis–lenis contrast. The [[extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet]] provide a diacritic for strong articulation (e.g. {{IPA|[t͈]}}) and weak articulation ({{IPA|[t͉]}}), but this does not cover all of the phonetic differences that have been categorized under fortis and lenis. [[Americanist phonetic notation]] uses fortis {{IPA|[t͈]}} and lenis {{IPA|[t&amp;#x1dc2;]}}.

Different ways of transcribing the fortis–lenis contrast have been used. For instance, for the transcription of the Zürich German fortis–lenis contrast – which does not involve either voicedness or aspiration –, notations such as the following ones have appeared in the relevant literature:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Fleischer|Schmid|2006|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The fortis–lenis contrast may be transcribed with plain {{IPA|[p t k f s x …]}} vs. {{IPA|[b d ɡ v z ɣ …]}}, even though this is in contradiction to their IPA definition that relies solely on voice.
*The fortis–lenis contrast may be transcribed as a gemination contrast ({{IPA|[pː tː kː fː sː xː …]}} or {{IPA|[pp tt kk ff ss xx …]}} vs. {{IPA|[p t k f s x …]}}).
*The fortis–lenis contrast may be transcribed as {{IPA|[p t k f s x …]}} vs. {{IPA|[b̥ d̥ ɡ̊ v̥ z̥ ɣ̊ …]}}, that is, the lenes are marked with the IPA diacritic for voicelessness. By strict IPA definition, this appears contradictory because if {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}} differ but in their voicedness, then a {{IPA|[b̥]}} that is voiceless should be identical to a {{IPA|[p]}}. This notation emphasizes that there is more than just voice to the contrast between {{IPA|[p t k f s x …]}} vs. {{IPA|[b̥ d̥ ɡ̊ v̥ z̥ ɣ̊ …]}}.

{{Foss Dyke map}}
The '''Foss Dyke''', or '''Fossdyke''', connects the [[River Trent]] at [[Torksey]] to [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], the county town of [[Lincolnshire]], and may be the oldest [[canal]] in England that is still in use. It is usually thought to have been built around AD&amp;nbsp;120 by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], but there is no consensus among authors. It was refurbished in 1121, during the reign of King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], and responsibility for its maintenance was transferred to the city of Lincoln by [[James I of England|King James I]]. Improvements made in 1671 included a navigable sluice or lock at Torksey, and warehousing and wharves were built at Brayford Pool in the centre of Lincoln.

Connection to the [[River Witham]] at Brayford was hampered by the small bore and depth of High Bridge, a medieval structure just below the pool. The channel through it was made deeper in 1795, but [[John Rennie the Elder|John Rennie's]] plans to demolish it in 1803 were not adopted. The canal was leased to several generations of the Ellison family, who profited from the tolls but failed to maintain it. Although cargos of coal and wool moved to the railway, the carriage of grain continued, and the last commercial operation was in 1972. The Brayford Mere Trust have turned Brayford Pool from a rubbish-filled eyesore into an attractive marina, and the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership are opening a footpath and cycleway from Lincoln to Torksey; the section to Saxilby was officially opened on 26 July 2011.

==Route==
The Fossdyke joins the [[River Trent]] at [[Torksey]]. A branch leaves the main channel, passes under the [[A156 road|A156]] bridge, and immediately enters Torksey lock, which is the only lock on the canal. It has six sets of gates, three sets facing Lincoln, and three facing the river, which is tidal at this point, and so its level can be higher than the level of the canal. The gates allow the lock to be used at most states of the tide. A steel footbridge crosses the lock near the road, and both the footbridge and the lock are [[grade II listed]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|197037|Torksey lock and footbridge|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The canal runs to the east, and then turns south, passing to the east of [[Fenton, West Lindsey|Fenton]] and Kettlethorpe. Soon it is joined by the [[A57 road]], and turns east again. The road runs along the south bank, until [[Saxilby]] is reached.&lt;ref name=osmap&gt;Ordnance Survey, 1:50,000 map&lt;/ref&gt;

At Saxilby, the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] crosses the waterway, to run along the south bank all the way to Lincoln. There was once a swing bridge beyond the railway bridge, which was removed in 1937, although the foundations are still obvious. Access over the canal at this point was reinstated in 1987, when a footbridge was installed. The original bridge was manufactured in 1884, and crossed the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] at [[Newark-on-Trent]] for 103 years before it was put to a new use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Lower |Richardson |2008 |pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The A57 crosses to the north bank soon after the railway bridge. The [[River Till, Lincolnshire|River Till]] flows south and under the road to join the Fossdyke, after which a new marina has been built at Burton Meadows. Because the construction has breached the flood bank, it is protected by a flood gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Lower |Richardson |2008 |pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The canal crosses under the [[A46 road]] on the outskirts of Lincoln, and then over a drainage ditch, to run alongside the Carholme golf club. The final bridge carries the B1273 Brayford Way over the canal as it enters [[Brayford Pool]], once a busy commercial wharf in the centre of [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], but now a marina with the [[University of Lincoln|University]] on the southern bank.&lt;ref name="osmap"/&gt; The unnavigable [[River Witham]] flows into the bottom end of the pool, and becomes the Witham Navigation when it flows out on its way to [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Foss Dyke was long thought to have been constructed by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] around 120.&lt;ref name=jane&gt;{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pointers include an inscribed statuette of the god ''Mars'' found in it at Torksey, which is now in the [[British Museum]],{{sfn |Greene |1992 |pp=52–53}} but there is a lack of consensus among authors writing on the subject.

The first record of it comes from [[Symeon of Durham]], whose ''Historia Regium'' notes the following for the year 1121:
{{blockquote|In the same year, king [[Henry I of England|Henry]] cut a large canal from Torksey to Lincoln, and by causing the River Trent to flow into it, he made it navigable for vessels.{{sfn |Stevenson |1855 |p=602}}}}

Some take this to mean that the canal did not exist before Henry's construction work. Thus Kevin Leahy writes:
{{blockquote|Even if the Fossdyke had been built by the Romans it needs a high level of maintenance and after a few hundred years of neglect it would have been difficult to find, let alone navigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Leahy |2007 |p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others, though, consider that Henry I merely scoured out an existing structure;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |McKnight |1981 |p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Bennett, writing for the East Midlands Archaeological Research Framework says:
{{blockquote|The Foss Dyke is almost certainly Roman. No quay has been identified at Lincoln as yet although a length of wall suggestive of a quay was uncovered in the 1950s at the site of the Telephone Exchange east of the walled city and north of the Witham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ulas/publications/documents/23linrom_000.pdf |title=An Archaeological Resource Assessment of the Roman Period in Lincolnshire |author=Mark Bennett |publisher=University of Leicester |accessdate=19 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907094744/http://www.le.ac.uk/ulas/publications/documents/23linrom_000.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The canal is about {{convert|11|mi|km}} long. It possibly follows an earlier line of the Trent, which emptied into [[the Wash]] in prehistoric times. Together with the {{convert|56|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Car Dyke]] it formed part an important transport route from [[Peterborough]] to [[York]].

It was reputedly used by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] when they invaded England&lt;ref name=nic&gt;{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Normans]] to carry stone to build [[Lincoln Cathedral]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=jane/&gt; Following King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]'s work discussed above, the canal deteriorated, until by the 17th century it was virtually impassable.  [[Katherine Swynford]], who lived in the area, is credited with having organized a protest to repair it, in 1375.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Hill |2008 |p= 312}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James I of England|King James I]] transferred ownership to the Corporation of Lincoln.&lt;ref name=nic/&gt;

In 1671, during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], Lincoln obtained an Act which authorised improvements from Boston to the Trent. Work was carried out on the Foss Dyke, but only the first {{convert|100|yd|m}} of the Witham, from Brayford Pool to High Bridge, received attention.&lt;ref name=boyes257&gt;{{harvnb |Boyes |Russell |1977 |pp=257–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was carried out by [[Samuel Fortrey]], a man with previous experience of draining the fens. He was required to bear some of the cost himself, in exchange for some of the profits. The work was completed in 1672, and included a navigable sluice or lock at Torksey, which had first been proposed by Simon Hill in 1632.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warehouses and wharves were built at Brayford Pool, but by 1717, passage from Torksey was again difficult. Coal traffic averaged 1,357 tons per year, bound for Lincoln, but tolls were insufficient to finance repairs. The city of Lincoln did not have the expertise to manage the waterway, and so leased it to Richard Ellison in 1741, who had experience with the [[River Don Navigation]]. He paid £75 per year for a navigation which generated around £100 in toll receipts. He dredged it to provide {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m}} of depth, and re-opened it in 1744. Two years later, the tolls were £595, and continued to increase. Under his son, the tolls were £2,367 in 1789, while his grandson collected £5,159 in 1811.&lt;ref name=boyes257/&gt;

Navigation through Lincoln and on to Boston was hampered by the shallow draught available under the medieval High Bridge, just below Brayford Pool. Sir [[Joseph Banks]], when proposing the construction of the [[Horncastle Canal]] knew that the problem needed addressing, and [[William Jessop]] was commissioned to survey the Witham and the Fossdyke in 1791, with particular reference to the junction between the two. He proposed a bypass to the south of the city, using the Sincil Dyke, or excavating the channel beneath the bridge, although he recognized that this solution was not ideal, due to the narrow width of the bridge hole, and the lack of a towing path through it. However, the city was keen to keep trade within its limits, and improvements to High Bridge, which were completed by 1795,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Boyes |Russell |1977 |p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; were authorised as part of the Horncastle Canal act of 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Clarke |1990 |p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FossdykeTorkseyLock.jpg|thumb|left|Torksey Lock, looking towards the River Trent. Four sets of gates are visible, and a further two sets are situated beyond the bridge.]]
The Witham Navigation was soon needing repairs, and the commissioners asked [[John Rennie the Elder|John Rennie]] for advice in 1802. His report, published in 1803, included recommendations to demolish High Bridge so that a waterway {{convert|34|ft|m}} wide could be built under a new bridge, and improvements to the Fossdyke costing £12,260. Neither action was followed. The Fossdyke was difficult to maintain, because much of it ran through sand and quicksand. The situation was more complex, because it had been leased to the Ellisons for three generations, and [[Richard Ellison (politician)|Richard Ellison III]] was not keen to spend any money on it. Income from tolls would have more than covered repairs, but there was little that could be done. A challenge to the legality of his lease was considered in the 1820s, but was not thought likely to succeed. He died in 1827, and Humphrey Sibthorp, his niece's husband, who was a proprietor on the River Witham, took over responsibility for it. He asked [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Isambard Brunel]] to survey it, and although he did so in 1833, no improvements were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Boyes |Russell |1977 |pp=261–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Railways arrived in Lincoln in 1848. The Wakefield, Lincoln and Boston Railway had negotiated with the proprietors of the Witham and Fossdyke in 1846, to guarantee them an income by leasing the waterways. Richard Ellison IV had agreed a lease for 894 years, at £9,570 per year, based on the average profit for the previous three years plus 5 per cent. The line was built by the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]], who took over the leases already agreed. The Witham was affected more than the Fossdyke, as the line followed its bank from Lincoln to Boston. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MSLR) passed through Saxilby to Lincoln a little later. Combined figures for the two waterways showed a drop in goods carried of two-thirds between 1848 and 1868. Cargos of coal and wool were the first to transfer to the railways. However, the MSLR, by then part of the [[Great Central Railway]], built a dock and transhipment warehouse at Brayford in 1897. The Fossdyke carried 75,881 tons in 1905, and an average of 69,611 between 1913 and 1917, most of it general goods and agricultural produce. A series of takeovers and mergers resulted in its ownership changing several times, before it was nationalised, and became the responsibility of the British Waterways Board in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Boyes |Russell |1977 |pp=266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although its date of construction is unknown, the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] Company built a small pumping station to the west of Torksey lock. It contained a steam-powered [[beam engine]], which was probably made by Davy Brothers of [[Sheffield]], and drove a double-acting bucket pump. It was situated close to the land drainage pumping station, which pumps into the tidal part of the Fossdyke, draining some {{convert|13000|acre|ha}} of low-lying land to the south of Torksey. Its job was to maintain the water levels in the navigation, but it was demolished in 1936, and no traces of it remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Hinde |2006 |p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new pumping station at a similar location was commissioned in 1974. This forms part of the Trent Witham Ancholme transfer scheme. A pumping station at Short Ferry on [[Barlings Eau]] pumps water through an {{convert|11|mi|km|0|adj=on}} pipeline to [[Toft Newton]] reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Ancholme. The water is used to maintain the flow and level of the Ancholme during the summer months and other dry periods. When there is insufficient water in Barlings Eau and the Witham, Torksey pumping station transfers water from the Trent through a short pipeline into Foss Dyke. From there it flows for {{convert|10.8|mi|km}} along the waterway to Brayford Pool and so into the Witham, to supplement the water available for pumping.{{sfn |Itinerary |1996 |pp=6–7}}

==Restoration==
Unlike many waterways, the Fossdyke never closed, and continued to carry grain traffic until 1972.&lt;ref name=jane/&gt; However, the demise of general commercial traffic had left Brayford Pool in the centre of Lincoln as a derelict eyesore, full of rubbish and sunken boats. The local Chamber of Commerce sought to address the issue in 1965, and formed Brayford Improvement Committee. Advice was sought from the [[Inland Waterways Association]], and eventually the Brayford Mere Trust was constituted. They removed the wrecks from the pool, and have rebuilt the site, so that it offers facilities for visiting pleasure craft,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Squires |2008 |p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; now the major users of the waterway.&lt;ref name="nic"/&gt; A former lift bridge, which crossed the western entrance to the pool, was replaced in August 1996 by a new concrete flyover, as part of the redevelopment of the south bank, which included the opening of the University in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oocities.org/lincolnboatclub/ |title=Navigation Notes |publisher=Lincoln Boat Club |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|2|mi|km}} to the west of Lincoln, a new {{convert|15|acre|ha|adj=on}} marina has been constructed at Burton Waters, as part of a {{convert|140|acre|ha|adj=on}} housing development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burton-by-lincoln.info/page4.html |title=Burton Waters |publisher=Burton by Lincoln Parish |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of a footpath and cycleway beside the canal from Lincoln to Saxilby has been carried out by the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership, a joint initiative by [[Lincolnshire|Lincolnshire County Council]], the [[Environment Agency]] and [[British Waterways]]. For much of its route it runs along the top of the northern floodbank, but drops down to a new crossing of the A57 road and a new bridge across the River Till near Saxilby. The route was officially opened on 26 July 2011. Extending the path to Torksey is a longer term aim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fossdyke Trail |author=Andrew Jee |publisher=Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership (Newsletter 24) |date=April 2011 |pages=1–2, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4977">'''Four Corners Rule''' is the meaning of a written document such as a [[contract]], [[Will (law)|will]], or [[deed]] as represented solely by its textual content. This term may also be applicable to other legal instruments.

==Contract interpretation==
In [[contract]] interpretation, the Four Corners Rule refers to a [[common law]] doctrine dating back to old English courts that requires the court to resolve contractual disputes based on the words contained in the disputed contract.  The four corners doctrine is similar to the [[parole evidence rule|Parole Evidence Rule]], which prohibits a contracting party from introducing evidence separate from the contract that would change fundamentally the intended understanding as written in the contract. However, the Four Corners Doctrine prohibits a party from introducing evidence to interpret an unambiguous term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thelawdictionary.org/four-corners/ Four Corners Rule definition]&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine also requires a court to discern what the contracting parties intended by using the whole document; no cherry picking.  Most commercial contracts contain a clause entitled either "Merger", "Integration", or "Entire Agreement". In this clause, there would usually be language indicating that the parties' understanding of the other provisions of the contract are contained within the four corners of the same.  Many modern contracts have taken it further to state that the entire agreement is contained within the agreement and that the agreement supersedes all prior understandings.  

==Examples==
* "There are no extraneous agreements or other understandings between the parties.  The entire agreement is contained within the four corners of this document and any dispute to the meaning contained therein will be governed by this document."
* "The parties intend that this Agreement, together with all attachments, schedules, exhibits, and other documents that both are referenced in this Agreement and refer to this Agreement, represent the final expression of the parties' intent relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, contain all the terms the parties agreed to relating to the subject matter, and replace all of the parties' previous discussions, understandings, negotiations, representations and agreements relating to the subject matter of this Agreement regardless whether written or oral."
* "This Agreement contains the entire and integrated agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior negotiations, representations, or agreements, whether written or oral."

==Case law==
The following is an incomplete list of examples where courts used the Four Corners Doctrine while interpreting the disputed-document:
# ''From the four corners of the document'': as derived from the text of the agreement itself, without relying upon other resources or witnesses.
#* "Absent ambiguity, the parties’ intentions must be discerned ''from the four corners of the document'', and extrinsic evidence may not be considered."&lt;ref&gt;[http://162.114.92.72/COA/2007-CA-000498.pdf KY Supreme Court 2007-CA-000498]&lt;/ref&gt;
#* "Construction of a deed is a matter of law, and the intention of the parties is to be gathered ''from the four corners of the instrument''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://162.114.92.72/COA/1995-CA-001813.pdf KY Supreme Court 1995-CA-001813]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Looking at the four corners of the will'': examining and analyzing the will.
#* "It is evident to us, from ''looking at the four corners of the will'', ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://162.114.92.72/COA/1996-CA-000833.pdf KY Supreme Court 1996-CA-000833]&lt;/ref&gt;
#  Determining whether to suppress evidence recovered and whether it was covered in the warrant.
#* "This Court has interpreted the above constitutional and statutory provisions of this State to mean just what they clearly state, and by doing so has characterized its interpretation by calling it the "four corners" rule or doctrine of law."&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/1986/1064-84-4.html ''Adkins v. State'', 717 S.W.2d 363 (1986) Texas]&lt;/ref&gt;
#* "We granted defendant's application for certiorari, 600 So. 2d 617 (La.1992), primarily to consider the rulings of the lower courts in the light of the "four corners" doctrine pronounced by this court in ''State v. Wells'', 253 La. 925, 221 So. 2d 50 (1969)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/louisiana/supreme-court/1993/92-k-0978-2.html ''State v. Barrilleaux'', 620 So. 2d 1317 (1993) Louisiana]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Deed interpretation.
#* "This case involves construction of a deed through which a mineral interest was conveyed. The language within the deed's "four corners" was construed by the chancery court as unambiguous, and this Court affirms."&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/mississippi/supreme-court/1990/07-ca-58744-1.html ''Pursue Energy Corp. v.

==Tourism==
[[Image:Gajendragad Fort Entrance.JPG|thumb|right|200px| Gajendragad Fort]]
The pilgrim Kalakaleshwara temple, is a huge mountain with the temple carved into it. This is a weekend destination which could be wound up in a day’s time. One can see many windmills lined on the hill opposite the hill on which the temple is located. Besides a beautiful view awaits you after the visit to the temple from the hill.

==Kalakaleshwara temple==
[[File:Gajendragad Kalkaleshwara infront of temple nature 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Nature in front of Kalkaleshwara Temple, Gajendragad, [[Karnataka]]]]

A little known pilgrim of [[North Karnataka]]. Gajendragad is a small town lying amidst hills, in one of which is encapsulated Kalakaleshwara temple of Lord Shiva (known as Dakshina Kashi), who is worshipped in the form of Kalakaleswara. There are some large steps that lead you up to the temple. It is a traditional temple with Udhbhava Lingu. There we can find God Virabhadra temple also in the same premises. But one would definitely be amazed at the story in which the significance of the destination lies. Just outside the temple exit is a small square water reservoir called AtharaGange. It is an evergreen water resource that constantly falls along the roots of Peepal tree into the pond all throughout the year. It is said to be flowing even in the peaks of summer season and has an unknown root.

===Mythology===

More amazing is the story attached to this destination that has taken a few lives too. These were the daring people who wanted to try to learn more about a miracle that happens on the previous night of [[Ugadi]], New Year of [[Kannadigas]]. The pandit/pujari of the temple prepares a solution of [[limestone]], and keeps it ready for application along with a brush, inside the temple. The next morning, the jobs done. But the temple is painted on its own and this happens without fail every year. A hookah that is also kept along with it seems to be used when seen the next morning.

Legend has it and so do elderly people that there used to be a bell equivalent to the size of soaked kidney beans that fit into 22 gunny bags. In the 1970s, it so happened that the bell vanished all of a sudden towards the heavens, ringing and sounds of the bell echoing and resonating in into the blue skies. And then there was an epidemic of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] that spread across the place, which people blame was due the bells act of vanishing.

==Tourism of Gajendragad region==

===Sudi===
Mallikarjuna Temple, Twin Towered Temple, Ishwara in a stone made shelter and Naga Kunda are prime attractions of [[Sudi]].

===Itagi Bhimambika===
Famous temple of [[Itagi Bhimambika|Bhimambika]], about 13&amp;nbsp;km from Gajendragad

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9265">'''Gender mainstreaming in teacher education policy''' refers to efforts to examine and change processes of policy formulation and implementation across all areas and at all levels from a gender perspective so as to address and correct existing and emerging disparities between men and women. It is a strategy to change the process of policy design, implementation and evaluation by taking into consideration the gender specific and often diverse needs, priorities, interests and values of differently positioned men and women.&lt;ref&gt;True, J. 2003. Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy. ''International Feminist Journal of Politics'', Vol. 5, No. 3, pp. 368–396.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, [[gender mainstreaming]] is about awareness of the existence of gender disparities and their causes and implications, and ensures that they are addressed at each phase of the policy cycle or policy analyses and revision.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002316/231646e.pdf|title=A Guide for Gender Equality in Teacher Education Policy and Practices|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100069-0|location=|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context and process ==
There are two situations in which [[Teacher Education Institutes]] (TEIs) can find themselves. One is that they may not have a policy at all, and the other is that they might have a policy but that the policy may not have addressed gender issues or mainstreamed gender. In the  first instance, TEIs need to develop a gender-responsive policy for their institutions, and in the second they need to review their policy from gender perspectives. In this part of the module we will look at mainstreaming gender in the different phases of the policy cycle: Problem Definition, Agenda Setting, Policy Formulation, Policy Legitimation and Policy Evaluation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Problem definition ===
Problem definition explains the nature, scope and significance of the problem within the context of the current policy environment (international, regional and national legal and policy commitments). During this stage, a problem is identified and examined, and possible solutions are explored through research and discussion. It requires that the delineation of the policy problem is as clear as possible in order to help identify problems of [[teacher education]], as well as gender issues that are relevant at the national level and that can be addressed by formulating policy in their applicable institutions. Whatever the problem identified, the TEI must be seen from the perspective of [[gender equality]]. In order to do this, the first step is to investigate gender disparities in different areas and levels among students, teaching staff and administration. In this regard, some of the following areas are analyzed:
* Number of male and female teaching staff
* Number of male and female teaching staff by qualification
* Number of male and female staff holding key administrative positions
* Number of male and female trainees
* Number of male and female trainees by academic performance&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Agenda setting ===
Once a problem is identified, a decision has to be reached as to whether it requires a policy intervention. If so, efforts will be made to bring the matter and its possible solutions to the attention of relevant staff and decision-makers to make it a policy-requiring issue. Already existing policies, strategies, programmes or offices may address some of the problems. The institute may need to review the policies, programmes or office structures, and also introduce a gender equality perspective to strengthen them further and address the problems more effectively. If there are gender-responsive policies available, TEIs may need to come up with a more concrete implementation plan, while other problems may require a policy initiative. In such a situation, the problem could be presented as a policy agenda to the relevant authority for consideration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Defining goals and outputs ===
After defining the problem, and once the problem is considered as requiring policy intervention, goals are identified in order to address the problem. In the context of TEIs, the goals could range from increasing enrolment, addressing quality, acquiring resources, and mitigating high staff turnover to narrowing gender disparities. Policy goals need to state gender concerns specifically and visibly. Different performance indicators and sex-disaggregated data need to be considered to capture the gender dimensions. The stated goals need to take into consideration the different gender related barriers women and men face to benefit equally and equitably.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Status of Women Canada. 1998. ''Gender-based analysis. A guide for policy-making''. Ottawa, Status of Women Canada. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.paci&lt;/nowiki&gt; cwater.org/user les/ le/IWRM/Toolboxes/gender/gender_based_analysis. pdf (Accessed 3 July 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy formulation ===
Policy formulation has two basic stages: determining the policy options and selecting the preferred option. This process may involve debate over alternative policy choices, which takes into account both the benefits and costs of each policy option. The policy alternatives are derived from a research process that investigates the problem in an in-depth manner using either primary or secondary sources of data or both. In collecting information all data, all relevant individuals and organizations have to be consulted, and all numerical data have to be disaggregated by sex. This stage may also entail analysis of existing policies. Based on the information gathered, the preferred policy options are presented, which will enable the policy objective to be effectively and efficiently reached.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Policy legitimation ===
For a policy to obtain a legal status, it has to be approved as an official policy document by relevant authorities in the TEI, as well as the ministry or relevant divisions within the ministry, depending on the structures and the practices of that specific country. This is an important step as it gives the policy legitimacy. Once it is approved, a policy also serves as an advocacy instrument, as well as a document that could be used to raise funds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Policy implementation ===
Implementation refers to the actual practical activities that need to be carried out to realize the policy goals and objectives. A number of critical decisions are made at this stage: decisions about regulations, structures, budget and partnerships, all of which are necessary to implement the policy. Policy implementation requires a commitment. As observed from experience, many countries and organizations have very good policy instruments, but most of the time they remain on paper. After going through the process of policy development, which is very resource intensive, its implementation requires serious consideration. The first inquiry should determine the changes needed to implement the policy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Policy evaluation ===
Evaluation is monitoring and assessing the process and impact of policy implementation. Policy research and analysis are used as strategies to evaluate whether the policy goals were reached, and if there were any unanticipated positive or negative outcomes. The evaluation process also attempts to see the various types of impacts: direct versus indirect, and short term versus long term. The information gathered from the evaluation will be used as inputs in the next policy cycle or process. Policy monitoring and evaluation is usually a challenging step as it requires consistent follow up, information collection, and efforts to compare policy goals with the outcome of activities carried out to implement the policy. The policy goals serve as a framework for any instrument that is designed to collect and compile information for the evaluation. The instruments that are designed should ensure that gender is included as a category of analysis and that issues concerning both men and women are included in the questions. Specific women's issues, as identified in the policy problem, should be covered, and during the data collection process both men and women should be included as sources of data. In the context of TEIs the data to be gathered on enrolment, performance and achievement, in-service training, promotion, leadership and administration are to be disaggregated by sex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Dr Glenn R. Foard''' (born c.1953) is an [[England|English]] landscape archaeologist, best known for discovering the location of the final phases of the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] (1485).  He is Reader in Battlefield Archaeology at the [[University of Huddersfield]].&lt;ref name="hud"&gt;[http://www.hud.ac.uk/ourstaff/profile/index.php?staffuid=entrgf Dr Glenn Foard - Profile - University of Huddersfield]. Accessed 30 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Foard obtained his first degree from [[University College, London]], in 1974, and went on to take an MA at the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]].&lt;ref name="hud" /&gt;  He later obtained a PhD in battlefield archaeology from the [[University of East Anglia]] (2008).

Foard is known for his work on major projects on behalf of the Battlefields Trust, [[English Heritage]], [[Historic Scotland]] and ''[[Time Team]]''.  While working for the Battlefields Trust, he led archaeological surveys of the sites of the [[Battle of Edgehill]] and the Battle of Bosworth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/faq/periodpageview.asp?pageid=202&amp;parentid=527 UK Battlefields Resource Centre]. Accessed 30 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Foard was appointed by [[Leicestershire County Council]] in 2005, in an exercise supported by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], to investigate the possible sites of the battle and try to establish its exact location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bosworthbattlefield.com/battle/archaeology.htm Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre]. Accessed 12 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Foard and his team discovered artefacts to support his theory that the site where the Bosworth Visitor Centre is currently located is several miles from the actual spot where the battle was fought.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/feb/19/battle-bosworth-site-found "Silver badge and lead shot pinpoint site of Battle of Bosworth", ''The Guardian'', 19 February 2010.] Accessed 30 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  These included a silver-gilt badge in the shape of a [[White boar|boar]], the emblem of King [[Richard III of England]], who was killed in the battle.  [[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]] called it "certainly the most important discovery about Bosworth in my lifetime".

"'''Grounded Vindaloop'''" is the seventh episode in the [[South Park (season 18)|eighteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 254th episode overall, it was written and directed by series co-creator and co-star [[Trey Parker]]. The episode premiered on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on November 12, 2014. The episode lampoons [[virtual reality headset]]s including the [[Oculus Rift]] using various science-fiction movie references, and customer service [[call center]]s.

==Plot==
In school, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] walks around wearing goggles and headphones, believing he is in a [[virtual reality]] (VR) setting of his school, when actually [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is playing a joke on him and communicating with him via a walkie-talkie. Butters becomes so convinced that he is in a VR setting that he goes home and punches his father [[List of South Park families#Stephen and Linda Stotch|Stephen]] in the genitals as payback for being [[grounding (punishment)|grounded]], steals a car in the style of ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', and tries to assault a prostitute but gets stabbed in the process. Butters wakes up in a hospital without his fake VR equipment. Cartman shows up, dressed similarly to [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] from ''[[The Matrix]]'' and, using dialog similar to ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' and magic illusions, convinces Butters that he is still trapped in the VR world since Butters took off the equipment outside of Cartman's room, which was the designated access point. The next day, Cartman receives a phone call from an [[Indian people|Indian]] [[call center]] employee calling himself Steve, from [[Oculus Rift]]'s technical support, who tells him that he is actually the one trapped in a VR state. [[List of South Park families#Liane Cartman|Cartman's mother Liane]], walks into Cartman's room and finds him in a catatonic state, hooked up to an Oculus Rift. Though she suggests that he has spent too much time with the device, she leaves his room after putting a meal on his desk.

Butters gets grounded by his father. Cartman confronts Butters about the call from Oculus Rift and threatens him by saying that whatever happens in VR happens in [[real life]]. [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] takes [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] to Cartman's house, where Cartman is still hooked up to the Oculus Rift. Kyle calls customer support and gets Steve again, who tells Kyle that they are doing a "total recall" of all the headsets, due to problems being experienced by them. Kyle and Stan think that this is a prank, but Steve says that one of them will have to put on a headset and attempt to guide Cartman to an access point. Kyle does so, but Cartman tells Kyle that it is actually Kyle trapped in the VR world and that Cartman was sent to save Kyle. Kyle calls the [[Best Buy]] store to see who actually purchased the device, but he is transferred to customer service, getting Steve again. Cartman and Kyle are both completely confused.

Stephen and Linda discuss Butters being grounded, and Stephen cannot remember why Butters was grounded in the first place. Cartman and Kyle meet with Stan, who is on the phone with Steve, and Kenny, who is unconscious and hooked up to an Oculus Rift. Stan tells Cartman and Kyle that what they are doing is all reality, while Cartman claims that he is a computer program, so one of the others must still be trapped in the VR world. Steve tells Stan that Butters was the first one to call customer service, then Steve calls customer service himself, getting another version of himself on the other end. Steve tells Steve that the call to customer service from within the VR setting has caused a [[feedback]] loop, which he names a customer service Vindaloop (a [[portmanteau]] of [[Vindaloo]] and loop). Kyle, Stan, and Cartman go to Butters, but Stephen catches the gang in the room and is upset since Butters is still grounded.  Steve is still on the phone with Stan and tells him that the paradox is due to a rule that customer service cannot be contacted from within VR. Steve tells Stan that the crucial question he must answer to resolve the paradox is the one that he has been asking him all along: "Have I answered your questions and provided good customer service?" When Stan finally answers yes, Butters, Stephen, Kyle, and Cartman all disappear. Stan realizes he has been the one in the VR setting, and heads back to an access point. Stephen realizes Butters is not grounded any more and sends him outside to play. As Stan takes off the Oculus Rift, the scene cuts to a [[live action]] shot of Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny, played by actors, at a computer, as Stan praises the Oculus Rift, despite its poor graphics. Shortly afterwards, an over-excited Butters enters the room, hopping up and down, elated that he's not grounded anymore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southpark.cc.com/blog/2015/03/10/fan-question-how-long-did-it-take-to-shoot-the-live-action-scene-in-grounded-vindaloop "Fan Question: How long did it take to shoot the live-action scene is "Grounded Vindaloop"?"]. ''South Park Studios'' (March 10, 2015). Retrieved February 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
On the DVD audio commentary for "Grounded Vindaloop", [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] discuss how the episode started: a drawing of Butters in the fake virtual reality headset that Cartman would use to mess with him. Parker said "It just seemed like such a natural way for Cartman to fuck with Butters by putting something like this on his head and telling him that he was in virtual reality when he really wasn't." One reason they stuck with it was because this idea of Cartman fooling Butters for his own entertainment had worked so well in past episodes, citing [[South Park (season 7)|season seven]]'s "[[Casa Bonita (South Park)|Casa Bonita]]" as a good example.&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;{{cite serial|title= [[South Park (season 18)|South Park: Season 18]]|episode=Grounded Vindaloop|series=[[South Park]]|last=Parker|first=Trey|authorlink=Trey Parker|last2=Stone|first2=Matt|authorlink2=Matt Stone|network=[[Comedy Central]]|airdate=September 24 – December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before actually starting work on the episode, Parker and Stone felt that the episode would be "so fuckin' fun" to write because as the episode unfolds, the viewers would be constantly getting confused as to which reality is real and which ones are the simulations. However, when working on the episode, particularly after the first act, Parker and Stone even became confused as to which world is the real world. They said to themselves beforehand that it will work, they'll figure it out later, but when that later came, it was more difficult to put it all together than expected.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt;

Another influence of the episode was the fact that Parker and Stone had been discussing doing something ''South Park'' related with virtual reality tools. They had also seen people experimenting with ''South Park'' virtual reality games.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt;

==Reception==
The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. The episode received a C+ rating from ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Eric Thurm, who commented that he had "no idea what actually 'happened' in 'Grounded Vindaloop'."&lt;ref name="A.V.

'''Gürcütepe''' is a [[Neolithic]] site on the southeastern outskirts of [[Şanlıurfa]] in [[Turkey]], consisting of four very shallow [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]s along Sirrin Stream that flows from Şanlıurfa. All four hills are now covered by modern buildings, so they are no longer recognizable. In the late 1990s a German archaeological team under the direction of [[Klaus Schmidt (archaeologist)|Klaus Schmidt]] carried out soundings on all four hills and made extensive excavations on the second hill seen from the east.

Originally it was assumed that the four hills were settled in a specific time sequence, that one of these settlement phases would coincide with the nearby [[Gobekli Tepe]]. However, the excavations have indicated that all four hills were settled during the [[Pre-Pottery_Neolithic_B|PPNB]] period; the easternmost hill is from the later [[Pre-Pottery_Neolithic#Pre-Pottery_Neolithic_C|PPNC]] period. 

Gürcütepe joins a group of Neolithic localities in [[Turkey#Prehistory_of_Anatolia_and_Eastern_Thrace|Turkey]], all rammed-earth buildings possessing space subdivisions next to larger community buildings. The small finds correspond to what we previously knew already. Overall, the Gürcütepe gives the impression of a rural settlement which was significantly younger than the famous [[Göbekli Tepe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5800">'''Sir Hermann Gollancz''' (1852 – 15 October 1930) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[rabbi]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] scholar. Gollancz was the first Jew to earn a doctor of literature degree from [[University College London|London University]] and the first holder of the degree to be ordained as a rabbi. He was the first British rabbi to be granted a knighthood, when he was knighted in 1923.&lt;ref name=HM/&gt;

Gollancz was born in [[Bremen]], [[Germany]], the son of Rabbi Samuel Marcus Gollancz, who led the Hambro Synagogue. He earned his degree at University College London and started preaching in 1876.&lt;ref name=HM&gt;Staff.

Accessed 15 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As there was no rabbinical training program in England at the time, he went back to Eastern Europe and received his [[semikhah|rabbinic ordination]] in 1897 from the chief rabbis of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], insisting thereafter that he be called "Rabbi" rather than "Reverend" and be called to the [[Torah]] with the honorific ''HaRav''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Apple (rabbi)|Apple, Raymond]].

''English Language Bible Translators''. Jefferson, NC &amp; London: McFarland and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated from Hebrew and Aramaic the [[Targum]] to the [[Song of Songs]]. His autobiography is titled ''Personalia'', published in 1928.

He was later named minister emeritus of the [[United Synagogue]] and served as president of the [[Jewish Historical Society of England]] in 1905 and 1906. In the 1923 [[King's Birthday Honours]], [[King George V]] conferred a [[Knight bachelor|knighthood]] upon him "in recognition of his contributions to learning",&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32840|supp=y|page=4606|date=29 June 1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him the first rabbi to receive a knighthood.&lt;ref name=HM/&gt;  He received the [[accolade]] from the king at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 25 July 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32849|page=5238|date=31 July 1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; His service to the Jewish community included the creation of numerous synagogues to serve workers at industrial plants, visiting the sick and assisting the poor. He was an advocate for public libraries and helped establish the Mocatta Library at University College, to which he donated thousands of volumes when he concluded his 21 years as Goldschmid Professor of Hebrew.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

Gollancz died in London, aged 78, on 15 October 1930. He was the elder brother of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] and English literature scholar Sir [[Israel Gollancz]] and the uncle of publisher [[Victor Gollancz]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8925">A '''historic house museum''' is a [[house]] that has been transformed into a [[museum]]. Historic furnishings may be displayed in a way that reflects their original placement and usage in a home. Historic house museums are held to a variety of standards, including those of the [[International Council of Museums]].

The International Council of Museums defines a museum as: ''"A museum as a non profit-making, permanent institution in the service of society and of its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits, for purpose of study, education and enjoyment, the tangible and intangible evidence of people and their environment."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icom.museum/who-we-are/the-vision/museum-definition.html|title=Museum Definition- ICOM|author=|date=|website=icom.museum|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houses are transformed into museums for a number of different reasons. For example, the homes of famous writers are frequently turned into [[writer's home museum]]s to support [[literary tourism]].

Also known as a ‘memory museum’, which is a term used to suggest that historic house museum contains a collection of the traces of memory of the people who once lived there. It is often made up of the inhabitants’ belongings and objects – this approach is mostly concerned with [[Provenance|authenticity]]. Some museums are organised around the person who lived there or the social role the house had. Other historic house museums may be partially or completely reconstructed in order to tell the story of a particular area, social-class or historical period. The ‘[[narrative]]’ of the people who lived there guides this approach, and dictates the manner in which it is completed. In each kind of museum visitors learn about the previous inhabitants through an explanation and exploration of [[Social History]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Philosophical/ideological influences==

The idea of a historic house museum derives from a branch of history called Social History that is solely based on people and their way of living.&lt;ref&gt;Social Memory Studies: From “Collective Memory” to Historical Sociology of Mnemonic Practices, Author(s): Jeffrey K. Olick and Joyce Robbins Source: Annual Review of Sociology, Vol. 24 (1998), pp. 105-140&lt;/ref&gt; It became very popular in the mid-twentieth century among scholars who were interested in the history of people, as opposed to political and economical issues. Social history remains an influential branch of history. Philip J. Ethington is a Professor of history and political science, further adds to social history and its relationship to locations by saying –

:''"All human action takes and makes place. The past is the set of places made by human action. History is a map of these places."'' &lt;ref&gt;Philip J. Ethington (2007): Placing the past: ‘Groundwork’ for a spatial theory of history, Rethinking History, 11:4, 465-493&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this historical movement, the concept of ‘[[Open-air museums|Open Air Museums]]’ became prominent.&lt;ref&gt;'Open-Air Museums: Architectural History for the Masses Author(s): Edward A. Chappell Source: Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians', Vol. 58, No. 3, Architectural History 1999/2000 (Sep., 1999), pp. 334-341&lt;/ref&gt; These particular types of museums had interpreters in costume re-enact the lives of communities in earlier eras, which would then be performed to modern audiences. They often occupied large wooden architecture buildings or outdoor sites and landscapes, that were true to the era adding to authenticity.

==Collective memory==

[[Collective memory]] is sometimes used in the resurrection of historic house museums; however, not all historic house museums use this approach. The notion of Collective Memory originated from philosopher and sociologist Maurice Halbwachs, in ‘La memoire collective’ (‘On Collective Memory’, 1950). This extended thesis examines the role of people and place, and how collective memory is not only associated with the individual but is a shared experience. It also focused on the way individual memory is influenced by social structures, as a way of continuing socialisation by producing memory as collective experience.

:''"Each aspect, each detail, of this place has a meaning intelligent only to members of the group, for each portion of its space corresponds to various and different aspects of the structure and life of their society, at least of what is stable in it."''&lt;ref&gt;‘The Collective Memory’ 1950, Chapter 4 ‘Space and the Collective Memory’&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a site that utilizes collective memory is the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]] in Japan. It was restored and is based on the dialectics of memory, however it also has the inclusion of joyous festivals to mask the turmoil. The ‘Hiroshima Traces’ (1999) text takes a look the importance of collective memory and how it is embedded in culture and place. Thus, collective memory does not only reside in a house or building, but it also resonates in outdoor space – particularly when a monumental event has occurred, such as war.

:''"The taming of memory that can be observed in the city’s redevelopment projects reveals local mediations and manifestations of transnational as well as national structural forces."''&lt;ref&gt;Hiroshima Traces – Time, Space, and the Dialectics of Memory, Lisa Yoneyama, University of California Press 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Problematic creation of collective memory occurs within historic house museums when the narrative of non-family members is dismissed, ignored, or completely rejected. Within the Southern United States, Plantation Museums (meaning the homes of former enslavers) constitute a significant portion of the museum community and contribute to the racialized collective memory of the United States. Because museums are responsible for “the building of identity, cultural memory and community,”&lt;ref&gt;Representations of Slavery: Race and Ideology in Southern Plantation Museums, Jennifer Eichstedt and Stephen Small, Smithsonian Press 2002&lt;/ref&gt; neglecting to include the narrative of ALL people who lived there is dangerous. While some Plantation museum narratives have changed following an outcry from the public and the academy, “plantation museums reflect, create, and contribute to racialized ways of understanding and organizing the world,”&lt;ref&gt;Representations of Slavery: Race and Ideology in Southern Plantation Museums, Jennifer Eichstedt and Stephen Small, Smithsonian Press 2002, pp. 6&lt;/ref&gt; by eliminating and limiting the narrative of the enslaved inhabitants.

==Authenticity==

A degree of authenticity is also to be considered in the restoration and creation of a historic house museum. The space must be authentic in terms of truly replicating and representing the way it once stood in its original form and appear to be untouched and left in time. There are three steps when declaring if a space is authentic:&lt;ref&gt;‘An Introduction to Authenticity in Preservation’, Pamela Jerome, APT Bulletin, Vol. 39, No. 2/3 (2008), pp. 3-7&lt;/ref&gt;

# Proof of identity must be presented and certified by a credible individual
# The attributes of the object or person must then be compared to the existing knowledge about it
# Documentation and credentials must then be used to support it and thus declare if it is authentic.

==Organizations==

There are a number of Organizations around the world that dedicate themselves to the preservation, restoration, resurrection or promotion of historic house museums. They include:

'''Indian Treasure Trove Act, 1878'''. (ACT NO. VI OF 1878. 1. ) (12 February 1878). An Act to amend the law relating to treasures found in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://asi.nic.in/pdf_data/9.pdf Indian Treasure Trove Act, 1878 ] Archaeological Survey of India 13 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asichennai.gov.in/act_rules.html Antiquity - Acts &amp; Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

It defines treasure specifically as "anything of any value hidden in the soil" and worth as little as 10 rupees (16 cents; 10 pence).
The finder of such treasure, according to this law, needs to inform the most senior local official of the "nature and amount or approximate value of such treasure and the place where it was found".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-law-in-India-for-someone-who-finds-buried-treasure-on-his-property What is the law in India for someone who finds buried treasure on his property?] Quora 13 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}} Also, if the finder fails to hand over the booty to the government, the "share of such treasure ... shall vest in Her Majesty", the Queen of [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-does-buried-treasure-in-india-still-belong-to-the-queen-india-to-wield-axe-on-287-laughable-colonial-british-laws-2024156 Does buried treasure in India still belong to the Queen?

'''Leeds University Library's Cookery Collection''' is one of the five Designated collections held by the [[Brotherton Library]] at [[University of Leeds]]. It comprises an extensive collection of international books, manuscripts and archives relating to food, cooking and culinary culture. 

The collection began with a donation in 1939 to the Library of 1,500 books and a selection of manuscripts. The collection has grown since then and has been supplemented with further donations over time. It now consists of more than 8,000 printed cookery books and 75 manuscripts, spanning the period of 2500 BC to present day, with the majority of the works being from the early 16th – 20th century.&lt;ref name="'Also of Interest', Cookery Printed Books"&gt;{{cite web|title='Also of Interest', Cookery Printed Books|url=https://library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/43229/cookery_printed_books|website=Special Collections|publisher=Leeds University Library|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to recipes and cookery books, the collection includes texts about food production, household management, brewery, gardening and the medicinal uses of food. 

Numerous food historians have used the Cookery Collection to inform their research and publications. The Cookery Collection is located in Special Collections in the Brotherton Library, University of Leeds.

== Designation ==

The Cookery Collection was awarded [[Designation Scheme|Designation]] status in 2005 by the [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]].&lt;ref name="Designated Outstanding Collections"&gt;{{cite web|title=Designated Outstanding Collections (Pg 45)|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/download-file/Designated_Outstanding_collections.pdf|website=Arts Council England|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Designation Scheme is a mark of distinction which recognises collections in non-national institutions of outstanding national and international importance for users.&lt;ref name="Designation Scheme"&gt;{{cite web|title=Designation Scheme|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/supporting-collections-and-archives/designation-scheme|website=Arts Council England|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme is now administered by [[Arts Council England]].  

The Cookery Collection is one of five Designated collections held by Special Collections at Leeds University Library.&lt;ref name="Designated Outstanding Collections"/&gt; It is the only library to hold as many as 5 Designated collections.&lt;ref name="CENDARI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leeds University Library|url=https://archives.cendari.dariah.eu/index.php/leeds-university-library|website=CENDARI|publisher=Collaborative European Digital Archive Infrastructure|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Overview ===

The Cookery Collection encompasses a series of collections from different origins which have been acquired by the Brotherton Library over time and are now grouped together by the subject of cookery as a single collection group.&lt;ref name="Cookery Collections Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cookery Collections Guide|url=https://library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-cookery-collection|website=Special Collections|publisher=Leeds University Library|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The English Cookery Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Eileen|title=The English Cookery Book: Historical Essays|date=2004|publisher=Prospect Books|isbn=1 90301836 6|pages=6–27|url=http://prospectbooks.co.uk/img/EnglishCookeryBook.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blanche Legat Leigh's donation ===

The Cookery Collection at Special Collections in the Brotherton Library began in 1939 when Blanche Legat Leigh, the Lady Mayoress of Leeds, donated her 1,500 printed books and some manuscript volumes to the Library.&lt;ref name="Secret Leeds"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=John, et al.|title=Secret Leeds|date=2017|publisher=Amberley Publishing|isbn=9781445655130|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vBjwDQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=cookery+collection+leeds&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=5 April 2017|ref=Secret Leeds}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these books were British, French and Italian cookery books dating from the early 16th century to 1930.&lt;ref name="The English Cookery Book"/&gt; An item of note from Leigh’s collection is a first edition of [[Mrs Beeton]]’s ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management|''Book of Household Management'']]'' with a letter inserted in it written to Leigh from Mrs Beeton’s son, Sir Mayson Beeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beeton Inserted Letter|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b1808715|website=Special Collections|publisher=Leeds University Library|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leigh’s donation included her correspondence with book owners, now held in Special Collections’ archives.&lt;ref name="Correspondence with booksellers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leigh's Correspondence with Booksellers|url=https://library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/5969|website=Special Collections|publisher=Leeds University Library|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Preston's donation ===

In 1954 some of the books from Blanche Leigh’s collection were displayed in an exhibition titled ''Cookery Books 1500–1954'' held in Times Bookshop in London. John F Preston was also displaying his collection at this exhibition and consequently became interested in Leeds University Library’s collection. In 1962 he presented his collection to the Library of over 600 [[English cookery]] books from 1584–1861.&lt;ref name="The English Cookery Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Monday Library Chat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Monday Library Chat|url=http://recipes.hypotheses.org/7481|website=The Recipes Project|publisher=Open Edition|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later donations ===

In the 1980s the Camden Public Library in London was running low on adequate space to hold their collection of books on food and drink. Their cookery books were advertised and as a result were rehomed in the Brotherton Library. The books spanned 1900–1975 and filled a period that was until then lacking in the Library’s Cookery Collection.&lt;ref name="The English Cookery Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Monday Library Chat"/&gt;

The Cookery Collection was recognised as an outstanding collection and accredited Designation status in 2005. Since then, the collection has continued to grow with more donations. 

A few years after the death in 2006 of Michael Bateman, the food writer and journalist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaine|first1=Tom|title=Obituary: Michael Bateman|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/30/guardianobituaries.media|accessdate=5 April 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leeds University Library received his collection of international cookery books in 2011.&lt;ref name="Monday Library Chat"/&gt;  Special Collections also holds an archive of his papers from his career as a food writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Bateman Archive|url=https://library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/33601|website=Special Collections|publisher=Leeds University Library|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Previously held Collections ===

Some material which was already held by the Brotherton Library and related to cookery has since been associated with the Cookery Collection in the interest of strengthening the subject.&lt;ref name="Cookery Collections Guide"/&gt; For example, [[#Chaston Brewing|Alfred Chaston Chapman]]’s collection of books about beer and brewery was donated to Leeds University Library in 1939.&lt;ref name="A Descriptive Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Offor|first1=Richard|title=A Descriptive Guide to the Libraries of the University of Leeds|date=1947|publisher=Brotherton Library|pages=51–55|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_descriptive_guide_to_the_libraries_of.html?id=XwQZAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaston Chapman notebooks"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaston Chapman notebooks|url=https://library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/167087|website=Special Collections|publisher=Leeds University Library|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New acquisitions===
The Cookery Collection at Leeds University Library is still being added to and augmented with new acquisitions. Leeds University Library is currently collecting manuscripts about cookery or medicinal remedies with a regional focus. More generally, Leeds University Library aims to collect titles which are not already represented in the Cookery Collection.&lt;ref name="Special Collections Development Policy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Collections Development Policy (Pg 5)|url=https://library.leeds.ac.uk/downloads/file/809/special_collections_collection_development_policy|publisher=Leeds University Library|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Collections and highlights  ==

The Cookery Collection has been catalogued in two distinct groups: Cookery Manuscripts and Cookery Printed Books.&lt;ref name="Cookery Collections Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Monday Library Chat"/&gt; The Cookery Printed Books collection has been split into several series and sub-collections. These include Cookery A: British books, Cookery B: French books, Cookery C: Chinese books, Cookery D: books from other cultures. Later donations, such as from [[#Later donations|Michael Bateman and Camden Library]], are also grouped in separate series.&lt;ref name="In this collection"/&gt; The following items are some of the most notable pieces in the Cookery Collection. The headings indicate which sub-collection or series each item is catalogued under. 

=== Ancient texts ===

In Blanche Leigh’s original 1939 donation to Leeds University Library was a [[Babylon|Babylonian]] clay tablet dating approximately 2500 BC.&lt;ref name="A Descriptive Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Monday Library Chat"/&gt;  This Middle Eastern tablet was once used a receipt for [[barley]] with ancient [[cuneiform script]] marks.&lt;ref name="Babylonian clay tablet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Babylonian clay tablet|url=https://library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/413784|website=Special Collections|publisher=Leeds University Library|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on permanent display in the Treasures of the Brotherton Gallery.&lt;ref name="Treasures of the Brotherton"&gt;{{cite news|title=Treasures of the Brotherton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-35457868|accessdate=5 April 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cookery Camden donation===

Among [[#Later donations|Camden Public Library's donation]] of 20th century cookery books to Leeds University Library were many works by the influential cookery writer, [[Elizabeth David]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of David, Elizabeth|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50960|website=ODNB|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her first cook book, ''[[A Book of Mediterranean Food]]'' (1950), she reintroduced more exotic ingredients – such as [[Common fig|fig]]s, [[garlic]] and [[olive oil]] – that had been absent from British cooking during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Elizabeth David|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/5318782/Elizabeth-David.html|accessdate=6 April 2017|publisher=The Telegraph|date=23 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chaston Chapman brewing donation===

Alfred Chaston Chapman was a chemist with a specialist interest in fermentation and brewing. He was president of the [[Institute of Brewing and Distilling]] from 1911 to 1913. In 1939 his widow donated to Leeds University Library his collection of books which cover the history of brewing, winemaking, the legality of alcohol and drinking in society.&lt;ref name="A Descriptive Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaston Chapman notebooks"/&gt; Some titles in his collection include: ''The Anatomy of Drunkenness'' (1840), ''The History and Science of Drunkenness'' (1883) and ''Oxford Night Caps: Being a Collection of Receipts for Making Various Beverages Used in the University'' (1835).&lt;ref name="Chaston Chapman notebooks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Monday Library Chat"/&gt;

===Cookery Manuscripts===
Individual manuscript volumes in the Cookery Collection have been grouped in the archive collection, Cookery Manuscripts. There are 75 items spanning the period 1561–2000 and covering the subjects of cookery, household management and medicinal remedies. Some of these manuscripts were part of Blanche Leigh and John Preston’s original donations to Leeds University Library but there are also more recent acquisitions.&lt;ref name="Cookery Manuscripts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cookery Manuscripts|url=https://library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/163707/cookery_manuscripts|website=Special Collections|publisher=Leeds University Library|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and outreach ==
===Research Topics===
The Cookery Collection at Leeds University Library has [[#Historians|proved to be an insightful research resource for scholars.]] 
*[[Cookbook|Cookery books]] are sources for attitudes, practices, trade and linguistics from a range of historical periods. Thus the study of the Cookery Collection's early cook books can shed light on the social and economic characteristics of past societies.&lt;ref name="The English Cookery Book"/&gt; 
*Cookery books can also offer insight into a society’s political climate. Conflicts and wars effect the availability of ingredients. As the British Empire expanded, the English cookery book used new dishes, foods and spices. These changes can be observed in the Cookery Collection at Leeds University Library.&lt;ref name="The English Cookery Book"/&gt;
*The illustrations in cook books held in the Cookery Collection form an outlet for study. Etchings and engravings reflect evolving practices in printing and the book industry.&lt;ref name="The English Cookery Book"/&gt;
*Studies of the history of medicine have been informed by the Cookery Collection at Leeds University Library because many of the books discuss nutrition, health and the medicinal uses of food.&lt;ref name="Medical"&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Leeds Library|url=https://ukmhl.historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk/leeds|website=UK Medical Heritage Library|publisher=Historical Texts|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In many cases the Cookery Collection at Leeds University Library holds long sequences of editions of outstanding works by popular authors such as [[Mrs Beeton]] and [[Hannah Glasse]].&lt;ref name="Beeton"&gt;{{cite web|title=Works by Mrs Beeton|url=https://library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/participant/14954|website=Special Collections|publisher=Leeds University Library|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glasse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Works by Hannah Glasse|url=https://library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/participant/46216|website=Special Collections|publisher=Leeds University Library|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These long runs and multiple copies mean that a text’s development across editions can be studied. Innovations and changes in the book and printing industry can also be observed.&lt;ref name="Medical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cookery Collections Guide"/&gt;
* Other focuses of the Cookery Collection include British cooking, French cooking, Chinese cooking, gardening, beer and brewery and wine and wine-making.&lt;ref name="Cookery Collections Guide"/&gt;

=== Historians ===

The Cookery Collection at Leeds University Library has informed an array of publications.
Anne Wilson was a member of staff at the Brotherton Library and catalogued the [[#John Preston's donation|Preston donation]] to the Leeds University Library Cookery Collection in 1964. This inspired her interest in food history. She went on to found the Leeds Symposium on Food History in 1986. Thus the Brotherton Library’s Cookery Collection was integral to the establishment of the Symposium.&lt;ref name="The English Cookery Book"/&gt; The Leeds Symposium has held annual meetings for the discussion of food history and the presentation of papers since 1986.&lt;ref name="Leeds Symposium"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.leedsfoodsymposium.org.uk/History.html|website=Leeds Symposium on Food History|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Anne Wilson wrote ''Food and Drink in Britain'' (1973) which draws on the Cookery Collection's early cook books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Anne|title=Food and Drink in Britain: from the Stone Age to recent times|date=1973|publisher=Cookery Book Club|isbn=0 09 456040 4|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She wrote ''The Book of Marmalade'' which was published in 1985. In it, she cites the Cookery Collection:
"Most of the older recipe books consulted are among those in the Blanche Leigh and John F Preston collections of early cookery books in the Brotherton Library at the University of Leeds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Anne|title=The Book of Marmalade|date=1985|publisher=Constable|isbn=0 09 465670 3|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Anne Wilson edited ''Luncheon, Nuncheon and Other Meals: Eating with the Victorians'' (1994) and ''The Country Kitchen Garden 1600–1950'' (1998). Both of these books mention the Brotherton Library’s Cookery Collection in their acknowledgements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Anne|title=Luncheon, Nuncheon and Other Meals: Eating with the Victorians|date=1994|publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing|isbn=0-7509-0528-X|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Anne|title=The Country Kitchen Garden 1600–1950 (In association with the National Trust)|date=1998|publisher=Sutton Publishing|isbn=0-7509-1423-8|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eileen White is a food historian specialising in domestic English cookery in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Author|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/English-Cookery-Book-Historical-Society/dp/1903018366|website=Amazon|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
White edited and contributed to ''The English Cookery Book: Historical Essays'', based on papers from the 16th Leeds Symposium on Food History held in March 2001. The book celebrates the Cookery Collection at Leeds University Library and pays tribute to its value for researchers. All the illustrations in the book are taken from the Brotherton Library’s collection.&lt;ref name="The English Cookery Book"/&gt;
White also edited ''Feeding a City: York'' (2000) and ''The English Kitchen: Historical Essays'' (2007), which also acknowledge the Brotherton Library’s Cookery Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Eileen|title=Feeding a City: York; The Provision of Food from Roman Times to the Beginning of the Twentieth Century|date=2000|publisher=Prospect Books|isbn=1 903018 02 1|page=14, 256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Eileen|title=The English Kitchen: Historical Essays|date=2007|publisher=Prospect Books|isbn=978-1-903018-50-7|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003 White wrote ''Soup'' in which she acknowledges "The collection of cookery books in the Brotherton Library at Leeds University has given me access to a wide range of original sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Eileen|title=Soup|date=2003|publisher=Prospect Books|isbn=1-903018-08-0|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Brears, Lynette Hunter and Jennifer Stead are other food historians who have consulted the Cookery Collection at Leeds University Library and contributed essays to the Leeds Symposium on Food History publications.&lt;ref name="The English Cookery Book"/&gt;  
''Cecilia Leong-Salobir'' cites "The Cookery Collection, Leeds University Library" as source in the acknowledgments for her book, ''The Food Culture in Colonial Asia: A Taste of Empire,'' Routledge, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leong-Salobir|first1=Cecilia|title=Food Culture in Colonial Asia: A Taste of Empire|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|page=64|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CWerAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=cookery+collection+leeds&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Los Angeles Review of Books''''' ('''''LARB''''') is a literary review journal covering the national and international book scenes.  A preview version launched on [[Tumblr]] in April 2011, and the official website followed one year later in April 2012. A print edition premiered in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/57363-los-angeles-review-of-books-debuts-print-edition.html |title='Los Angeles Review of Books' Debuts Print Edition |author=Werris, Wendy |date= May 23, 2013 |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate= May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Tom Lutz]], Chair of the Creative Writing Department at the [[University of California, Riverside]], the ''Review'' seeks to redress the decline in Sunday book supplements by creating an online “encyclopedia of contemporary literary discussion.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.com/blogPost/The-Los-Angeles-Review-of/25674 |title='The Los Angeles Review of Books' to Launch This Fall |author=Ayoub, Nina |date= July 20, 2010 |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |accessdate= August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''LARB'' features reviews of new fiction, poetry, and nonfiction; original reviews of classic texts; essays on contemporary art, politics, and culture; and literary news from abroad, including Mexico City, London, and St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/43875-los-angeles-review-of-books-to-launch-this-fall.html |title='Los Angeles Review of Books' to Launch This Fall |author=Werris, Wendy |date= July 19, 2010 |work=Publishers Weekly |accessdate= August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site also proposes looking seriously at detective fiction, thrillers, comics, graphic novels, and other writing “often dismissed as genre fiction,” and printing reviews of books published by university presses.   Of these plans Lutz has said, “What's considered worthy of study in the literary world has shifted radically over the past 50 years, and it reflects the natural evolution of academic thought, which is constantly raising questions about what matters.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2010-05-20/la-life/tom-lutz-keeper-of-the-printed-word/ |title='Lutz: Keeper of the Printed Word' |author=[[McKenna, Kristine]] |date= May 20, 2010 |work=[[LA Weekly]] |accessdate= August 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site also features input from over 200 contributing editors, including [[Reza Aslan]], [[Aimee Bender]], [[T. C. Boyle]], [[Antonio Damasio]], [[Jonathan Kirsch]], [[Chris Kraus (American writer)|Chris Kraus]], [[Jonathan Lethem]], [[Jeffrey Eugenides]], [[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]], [[Jane Smiley]], [[David Shields]], [[Carolyn See]], [[Barbara Ehrenreich]], [[Greil Marcus]], [[Jaron Lanier]] and [[Jerry Stahl]].

In addition to Lutz, the current editorial staff includes Boris Dralyuk (Executive Editor) and Medaya Ocher (Managing Editor). Section editors include Merve Emre (Humanities), [[Object Lessons|Evan Kindley]] (Humanities), [[Rob Latham]], [[Robin Coste Lewis]], Janice Rhoshalle Littlejohn, [[Lisa Teasley]] (Fiction), Ellie Duke (blog), Laurie Winer, Kate Wolf, Sarah Mesle, [[Jonathan Alexander (professor)]] (Young Adult Fiction), Callie Siskell (Poetry), Feliz Luiz Molina (Poetry), Stefanie Sobelle (Fiction), Michele Pridmore-Brown (Science), Anna Shechtman (Film), Michelle Chihara (Economics and Finance), Eric Newman (Gender and Sexuality), Robert Zaretsky (History), Brad Evans (History of Violence), [[Lee Konstantinou]] (Humanities), Don Franzen (Law), Sarah Fuss Kessler (Memoir and Essay), Orly Minazad (Memoir and Essay), [[Steph Cha]] (Noir), Arne De Boever (Philosophy and Theory), [[Costica Bradatan]] (Religion and Comparative Studies), [[Jeffrey Wasserstrom]] (China), Andrew Hoberek (Comics/Graphic Novel)s, and [[Tom Zoellner]] (Politics).

== History ==
The site of Lower Dover consists of a civic ceremonial center that was occupied in the latter part of the Late [[Classic Maya|Classic]], abandoned during the Terminal [[Classic Maya|Classic]], and partially reoccupied in the Early [[Postclassic Maya|Postclassic]];&lt;ref name="Guerra&amp;Collins2015" /&gt; and a settlement area to the south that was occupied as early as the Middle [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic]].&lt;ref name="Petrozza&amp;Biggie2015"&gt;Petrozza, Michael Louis, and Michael Biggie.

Awe, Eds., The Belize Valley Archaeological Reconnaissance Project: A Report of the 2014 Field Season, pp. 25-37. Institute of Archaeology, National Institute of Culture and History, Belmopan, Belize.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on its location and the similarity of its architecture to that of the better-understood [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological site]] of [[Cahal Pech]], it has been speculated that Lower Dover’s civic ceremonial center was an administrative seat for both the Lower Dover and [[Barton Ramie]] settlement areas,&lt;ref name="Kulig2015"&gt;Kulig, Shannon R.

== Excavations ==
The site of Lower Dover was discovered by William and Madeline Reynolds, owners of the land and proprietors of the Lower Dover Field Station &amp; Jungle Lodge, and brought to the attention of the Institute of Archaeology, National Institute of Culture and History ([[Belize]]), in 2009.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson&amp;Hude2011"&gt;Wilkinson, Patrick, and Molly Hude.

The '''Lyres of Ur''' or '''Harps of Ur''' are considered to be the world's oldest surviving [[stringed instrument]]s.  In 1929, archaeologists led by [[Leonard Woolley]] discovered the instruments when excavating the [[Royal Cemetery of Ur]] between from 1922 and 1934.  They discovered pieces of three [[lyre]]s and one [[harp]] in [[Ur]], located in what was [[Ancient Mesopotamia]] and is contemporary [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="reproduced"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/news/press_releases/2005/07/lyre_of_ur.htm |title=Ancient Iraqi harp reproduced by Liverpool engineers |accessdate=2009-11-23 |quote=A team of engineers at the University of Liverpool has helped reproduce an ancient Iraqi harp - the Lyre of Ur. |date=28 July 2005 |publisher=[[University of Liverpool]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701185936/http://www.liv.ac.uk/news/press_releases/2005/07/lyre_of_ur.htm |archivedate=1 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spanglefish.com/BillTaylor/index.asp?pageid=69109 Golden Lyre of Ur], Bill Taylor&lt;/ref&gt;  They are over 4,500 years old,&lt;ref name="britishmuseum"/&gt;  from ancient Mesopotamia during the [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic III Period]] (2550–2450 BC).&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lyre with Bearded Bull’s Head and Inlaid Panel|url = http://withart.visitphilly.com/artworks/lyre-with-bearded-bulls-head-and-inlaid-panel/|accessdate = 2015-09-26|publisher = |website = With Art Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decorations on the lyres are fine examples of the court [[art of Mesopotamia]] of the period.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art of the First Cities: The Third Millennium B.C. from the Mediterranean to the Indus|last = Aruz|first = J. &amp; Wallenfels|publisher = The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year = 2003|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard Woolley, a British archaeologist, discovered the lyres amongst the bodies of ten women in the Royal cemetery at Ur. One body was even said to be laying against the lyre with her skeletal hand placed where the strings would have been.&lt;ref name="britishmuseum"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Queen's Lyre|url = https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=368339&amp;partId=1|website = [[British Museum]]|accessdate = 2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon this discovery, Woolley was quick to pour in a liquid plaster to recover the delicate form of the wooden frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Lyre of Ur, Carl McTague|url = http://www.mctague.org/carl/music/computer/pieces/lyre/|website = www.mctague.org|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wood of the lyres was decayed but since some were covered in nonperishable materials, like gold and silver, they were able to be recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://research.kcai.edu:2177/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=3&amp;sid=cc8d79f2-3153-47c1-b193-2539601d320f%40sessionmgr115&amp;hid=125|title = Two Lyres from Ur|last = Lawergren|first = Bo|date = November 2005|journal = Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Strictly speaking, three lyres and one harp were discovered, but all are often called lyres. The instrument remains were restored and distributed between the museums that took part in the digs.

==Lyres ==
A lyre is a musical instrument that is stringed and has a role projecting from the body. There are two types of lyres: box and bowl. Like their names suggest the box lyres have a boxlike body and the bowl lyres have a round body with a curved back. The Lyres of Ur are box lyres. They were played in an upright position with the strings plucked with both hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia|url = http://academic.eb.com/EBchecked/topic/353012/lyre|website = academic.eb.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of how they were discovered it is believed that the lyres were used in burial ceremonies in accompaniment to songs. Each lyre has 11 strings to play on that would produce a buzzing noise that repeated throughout the song. The musician playing the instrument would repeat the pattern displayed on the lyre.

==The four lyres==

The "Golden Lyre of Ur" or "Bull's Lyre" is the finest lyre, and was given to the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyre-of-ur.com/ |title=lyre-of-ur.com |publisher=lyre-of-ur.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its reconstructed wooden body was damaged due to flooding during the second [[Iraqi War]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Bogdanos |url=http://www.ajaonline.org/newsletter/110 |title=The Casualties of War: The Truth about the Iraq Museum &amp;#124; American Journal of Archaeology |publisher=Ajaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carl McTague |url=http://www.mctague.org/carl/music/computer/pieces/lyre/ |title=The Lyre of Ur, Carl McTague |publisher=Mctague.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a replica of it is being played as part of a touring [[orchestra]].&lt;ref name="reproduced" /&gt; The "Golden Lyre" got its name because the whole head of the bull is made of gold. The eyes are made of inlaid mother-of-pearl and lapis lazuli. The beard is similar in appearance to the "Great Lyre" and the "Queen's Lyre". The body of the bull was originally wood but did not survive. Its discoverer, Woolley, believes that unlike the other lyres, the body of the "Golden Lyre" would have originally had legs.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

The "Queen's Lyre" is one of two that Woolley found in the grave of Queen [[Pu-abi]].&lt;ref name="britishmuseum"/&gt;  The "Queen's Lyre" is {{convert|44|in|cm|disp=flip}} in height and is similar in appearance to that of the "Great Lyre".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The mask of the bull is gold. The eyes, hair, and beard are all made of lapis lazuli and the horns are modern. The shape of the lyre is meant to resemble a bull's body. A noticeable difference between the "Great Lyre" and the "Queens Lyre" is that the "Great Lyre" has a straight forehead where the "Queen's Lyre" curves slightly around the brow bone.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; It is held in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name="britishmuseum" /&gt;

The "Great Lyre" is {{convert|13|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in height and {{convert|4.5|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in width. The shape of the lyre is meant to resemble a bull's body. Its head, face and horns are all wrapped in gold foil.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lyres from The Royal Tombs of Ur|url = http://sumerianshakespeare.com/117701/117901.html|website = sumerianshakespeare.com|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head is garnished with lapis lazuli hair, beard, and eyes. Below the beard is a front panel made of lapis lazuli, shell and red limestone originally set in bitumen.&lt;ref name="britishmuseum"/&gt; This frontal panel depicts a figure holding onto a bull's horns above, and animals acting as humans below. The bull head itself, represents the sun god Shamash. Shamash is a divine judge who could descend into the underworld.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

The "Silver Lyre" is {{convert|42|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in height and {{convert|38|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in width. It is one of two silver lyres discovered in "The Great Pit". Both lyres were made of wood and then covered in sheets of silver that were attached with small silver nails. The eyes are made of lapis lazuli and the lyre was also trimmed with narrow borders of lapis lazuli. This is the only lyre that is not bearded. Because of this fresh face some believe it is actually a cow rather than a bull.

A silver Boat-shaped Lyre and a lyre with the head of a bull made of gold sheet and a [[lapis lazuli]] beard are held by the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/13629.html |title=Two Lyres from Ur, Maude de Schauensee |publisher=Upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Língua dos Pês''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''P Language'') is a [[Language game (linguistics)|language game]] spoken in [[Brazil]] and [[Portugal]] with [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. It is also known in other languages, such as [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans]].

==Function==

There are at least three different "dialects," or variations, of Língua do Pê.

==="Double talk" dialect===

This "dialect" of Língua do Pê is just like the [[Jeringonza]] and the Idioma F language games in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].  It works by repeating the [[Syllable rime|rime]] of each syllable, beginning it with ''p'' (''pê'' in Portuguese).  Examples:

* você → ''vo-po-cê-pê''
* gato → ''ga-pa-to-po''
* menino → ''me-pe-ni-pi-no-po''

===Vowel-changing dialect===

This "dialect" is like the one described above, except that some vowels are changed.  When an open syllable (one that ends in a vowel) has {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[e]}} as its vowel, it is changed to {{IPA|[ɔ]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, respectively. 

: '''Example:'''

* {{IPA|[vɔˈpɔsɛˈpɛ korˈportouˈpou ɔˈpɔ seuˈpeu kaˈpabɛˈpɛlɔˈpɔ]}}
* ''Você cortou o seu cabelo?'' (Did you cut your hair?)

Please note that the syllables beginning with ''p'' are stressed, not the original syllables.

==="Pê" dialect===

This "dialect" is more like Kongarian (a language game spoken with Hungarian) than the other "dialects" of Língua do Pê.  To speak it, the syllable ''pê'' is inserted before every syllable. This is the variant most used in Brazilian Portuguese, while the others are more common in European Portuguese.

: '''Example:'''

* ''pêLem pêBra pêCo pêMo pêE pêRa pêLe pêGal?''
* Lembra como era legal? (Do you remember how cool it was?)

===Dutch===

In the Netherlands, the most common version is to instert the syllable "ep" before every sonant.

:'''Example:'''

*De boer woont op het platteland. (The farmer lives in the countryside.)
*''Depe bepoer wepoont epop hepet plepattepelepand.''

'''Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999''' ('''MCOCA''') is a law enacted by [[Maharashtra]] state in [[India]] in 1999 to combat organised crime and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/jan/10spec.htm |title=Special: Lawyer Shrikant Bhat Control of Organised Crime Act |publisher=Rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preamble to MCOCA says that "the existing legal framework, i.e. the penal and procedural laws and the adjudicatory system, are found to be rather inadequate to curb or control the menace of organised crime. Government has, therefore, decided to enact a special law with stringent and deterrent provisions including in certain circumstances power to intercept wire, electronic or oral communication to control the menace of organised crime." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/document/actandordinances/maharashtra1999.htm |title=Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 |publisher=Satp.org |date=1999-02-24 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike normal law the [[Confession (law)|confessions]] before senior police officers are admissible, not only against the accused giving the confession but also against the other accused in the same case. There is no provision for granting [[anticipatory bail]] for 6 months  to the accused.&lt;ref name="MCOCA extended to Delhi"&gt;{{cite news|title=MCOCA extended to Delhi|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2002/01/08/stories/2002010803220300.htm|accessdate=28 July 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=Jan 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 in order to curb the increasing crimes of the organised gangs this law was extended to the National Capital Territory of [[Delhi]] by the Union Home Ministry.&lt;ref name="MCOCA extended to Delhi"/&gt; Ajai Raj Sharma the then Commissioner of [[Delhi Police]] told a press conference, "Organised gangs had been trying to gain a foothold in the national capital but their designs had been foiled so far.

In [[politics]], a '''mandate''' is the [[authority]] granted by a [[constituency]] to act as its [[Representative democracy|representative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mandate |work=Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |title=Mandate |publisher=Merriam-webster.com|accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a government having a [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] mandate to govern via the fair winning of a [[democracy|democratic]] [[election]] is a central idea of [[representative democracy]]. New governments who attempt to introduce policies that they did not make public during an election campaign are said not to have a legitimate ''mandate'' to implement such policies.

Elections, especially ones with a large margin of victory, and are often said to give the newly [[Election|elected]] [[Government in exile|government]] or elected official an implicit mandate to put into effect certain [[policies]].&lt;ref&gt;Glossary | Elections ACT. Jul 2012. http://www.elections.act.gov.au/glossary (cf., ''The Government's claim that once elected they have the right and responsibility to implement their policies''.)&lt;/ref&gt; When a government seeks re-election they may introduce new policies as part of the campaign and are hoping for approval from the voters, and say they are seeking a "new mandate".

In some languages, a 'mandate' can mean a parliamentary seat won in an election rather than the electoral victory itself. In case such a mandate is bound to the wishes of the electorate, it is an [[imperative mandate]], otherwise it is called "free".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31220">'''Mass comparison''' is a method developed by [[Joseph Greenberg]] to determine the level of [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relatedness]] between languages. It is now usually called '''multilateral comparison'''. The method is rejected by most linguists {{Harv|Campbell|2001|p=45}}, though not all.

Some of the top-level relationships Greenberg named had already been posited by others and are now generally accepted (e.g. [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] and [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]]). Others are accepted by many though disputed by some prominent specialists (e.g. [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]), others are predominantly rejected but have some defenders (e.g. [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]]), while others are almost universally rejected (e.g. [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] and [[Amerind languages|Amerind]]).

== Theory ==

Mass comparison involves setting up a table of basic vocabulary items and their forms in the languages to be compared. The table can also include common morphemes. The following table was used by {{Harvtxt|Greenberg|1957|p=41}} to illustrate the technique. It shows the forms of six items of basic vocabulary in nine different languages, identified by letters.

The basic relationships can be determined without any experience in the case of languages that are fairly closely related. Knowing a bit about probable paths of sound change allows one to go farther faster. An experienced [[linguistic typology|typologist]]—Greenberg was a pioneer in the field—can quickly recognize or reject several potential cognates in this table as probable or improbable. For example, the path ''p'' &gt; ''f'' is extremely frequent, the path ''f'' &gt; ''p'' much less so, enabling one to hypothesize that ''fi'' : ''pi'' and ''fik'' : ''pix'' are indeed related and go back to protoforms *''pi'' and *''pik/x'', while knowledge that ''k'' &gt; ''x'' is extremely frequent, ''x'' &gt; ''k'' much less so enables one to choose *''pik'' over *''pix''. Thus, while mass comparison does not attempt to produce reconstructions of protolanguages—according to Greenberg (2005:318) these belong to a later phase of study—phonological considerations come into play from the very beginning.

The tables used in actual research involve much larger numbers of items and languages. The items included may be either lexical, such as 'hand', 'sky', and 'go', or morphological, such as PLURAL and MASCULINE {{Harv|Ruhlen|1987|p=120}}.

=== Detection of borrowings ===

Critics of mass comparison generally assume that mass comparison has no means to distinguish borrowed forms from inherited ones, unlike comparative reconstruction, which is able to do so through regular sound correspondences. These questions were addressed by {{Harvtxt|Greenberg|1957|p=39}} as of the 1950s. According to him, the key points are as follows :

*Basic vocabulary is much less readily borrowed than cultural vocabulary.
*"[D]erivational, inflectional, and pronominal morphemes and morph alternations are the least subject of all to borrowing."
*Any type of linguistic item may be borrowed "on occasion". However, "fundamental vocabulary is proof against mass borrowing."
*Mass comparison does not possess means to distinguish borrowing in every instance: "in particular and infrequent instances the question of borrowing may be doubtful". However, it is always possible to detect whether borrowing is responsible for "a mass of resemblances" between languages: "Where a mass of resemblances is due to borrowing, they will tend to appear in cultural vocabulary and to cluster in certain semantic areas which reflect the cultural nature of the contact."
*The technique of mass comparison, as opposed to bilateral comparison, provides a check on whether forms are borrowed or not {{Harv|Greenberg|1957|p=40}}:

::Borrowing can never be an over-all explanation of a mass of recurrent basic resemblances in many languages occurring over a wide geographical area.... Since we find independent sets of resemblances between every pair of languages, among every group of three languages, and so on, each language would have to borrow from every other.

*"[R]ecurrent sound correspondences" do not suffice to detect borrowing, since "where loans are numerous, they often show such correspondences" {{Harv|Greenberg|1957|pp=39&amp;ndash;40}}.

Greenberg considered that the results achieved through this method approached certainty {{Harv|Greenberg|1957|p=39}}: "The presence of fundamental vocabulary resemblances and resemblances in items with grammatical function, particularly if recurrent through a number of languages, is a sure indication of genetic relationship."

=== The place of sound correspondences in the comparative method ===

It is often reported that Greenberg sought to replace the [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] with a new method, mass comparison (or, among his less scrupulous critics, "mass lexical comparison"). He consistently rejected this characterization, stating for instance, "The methods outlined here do not conflict in any fashion with the traditional comparative method" (1957:44) and expressing wonderment at "the strange and widely disseminated notion that I seek to replace the comparative method with a new and strange invention of my own" (2002:2). According to Greenberg, mass comparison is the necessary "first step" in the comparative method (1957:44), and "once we have a well-established stock I go about comparing and reconstructing just like anyone else, as can be seen in my various contributions to historical linguistics" (1990, quoted in Ruhlen 1994:285). Reflecting the methodological [[empiricism]] also present in his [[linguistic typology|typological]] work, he viewed facts as of greater weight than their interpretations, stating (1957:45):

:[R]econstruction of an original sound system has the status of an explanatory theory to account for etymologies already strong on other grounds. Between the *''vaida'' of Bopp and the *''γwoidxe'' of Sturtevant lie more than a hundred years of the intensive development of Indo-European phonological reconstruction. What has remained constant has been the validity of the etymologic relationship among Sanskrit ''veda'', Greek ''woida'', Gothic ''wita'', all meaning "I know", and many other unshakable etymologies both of root and of non-root morphemes recognized at the outset. And who will be bold enough to conjecture from what original the Indo-Europeanist one hundred years from now will derive these same forms?

=== Summary ===

The thesis of mass comparison, then, is that:

*A group of languages is related when they show numerous resemblances in basic vocabulary, including pronouns, and morphemes, forming an interlocking pattern common to the group.
*While mass comparison cannot identify every instance of borrowing, it can identify broad patterns of borrowing, which suffices in establishing genetic relationship.
*The results achieved approach certainty.
*It is unnecessary to establish sets of recurrent sound correspondences or reconstructed ancestral forms to identify genetic relationships. On the contrary, it is not possible to establish such correspondences or to reconstruct such forms until genetic relationships are identified.

== Disputed legacy of the comparative method ==

The conflict over mass comparison can be seen as a dispute over the legacy of the comparative method, developed in the 19th century, primarily by Danish and German linguists, in the study of [[Indo-European languages]].

=== Position of Greenberg's detractors ===

Since the development of [[comparative linguistics]] in the 19th century, a linguist who claims that two languages are related, whether or not there exists historical evidence, is expected to back up that claim by presenting general rules that describe the differences between their lexicons, morphologies, and grammars. The procedure is described in detail in the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] article.

For instance, one could demonstrate that [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is related to [[Italian language|Italian]] by showing that many words of the former can be mapped to corresponding words of the latter by a relatively small set of replacement rules—such as the correspondence of initial ''es-'' and ''s-'', final ''-os'' and ''-i'', etc. Many similar correspondences exist between the grammars of the two languages. Since those systematic correspondences are extremely unlikely to be random coincidences, the most likely explanation by far is that the two languages have evolved from a single ancestral tongue ([[Latin]], in this case).

All pre-historical language groupings that are widely accepted today—such as the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] families—have been established this way.

=== Response of Greenberg's defenders ===

The actual development of the comparative method was a more gradual process than Greenberg's detractors suppose. It has three decisive moments. The first was [[Rasmus Christian Rask|Rasmus Rask]]'s observation in 1818 of a possible regular sound change in Germanic consonants. The second was [[Jacob Grimm]]'s extension of this observation into a general principle ([[Grimm's law]]) in 1822. The third was [[Karl Verner]]'s resolution of an irregularity in this sound change ([[Verner's law]]) in 1875. Only in 1861 did [[August Schleicher]], for the first time, present systematic reconstructions of Indo-European proto-forms (Lehmann 1993:26). Schleicher, however, viewed these reconstructions as extremely tentative (1874:8). He never claimed that they proved the existence of the Indo-European family, which he accepted as a given from previous research—primarily that of [[Franz Bopp]], his great predecessor in Indo-European studies.

[[Karl Brugmann]], who succeeded Schleicher as the leading authority on Indo-European, and the other [[Neogrammarian]]s of the late 19th century, distilled the work of these scholars into the famous (if often disputed) principle that "every sound change, insofar as it occurs automatically, takes place according to laws that admit of no exception" (Brugmann 1878).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lehmann |first=Winfred P. |url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/books/read14.html |title=A Reader in Nineteenth Century Historical Indo-European Linguistics: Preface to 'Morphological Investigations in the Sphere of the Indo-European Languages' I |publisher=Utexas.edu |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neogrammarians did not, however, regard regular sound correspondences or comparative reconstructions as relevant to the proof of genetic relationship between languages. In fact, they made almost no statements on how languages are to be classified (Greenberg 2005:158). The only Neogrammarian to deal with this question was [[Berthold Delbrück]], Brugmann's collaborator on the ''[[Grundriß der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen]]'' (Greenberg 2005:158-159, 288). According to Delbrück (1904:121-122, quoted in Greenberg 2005:159), Bopp had claimed to prove the existence of Indo-European in the following way:

:The proof was produced by juxtaposing words and forms of similar meanings. When one considers that in these languages the formation of the inflectional forms of the verb, noun and pronoun agrees in essentials and likewise that an extraordinary number of inflected words agree in their lexical parts, the assumption of chance agreement must appear absurd.

Furthermore, Delbrück took the position later enunciated by Greenberg on the priority of etymologies to sound laws (1884:47, quoted in Greenberg 2005:288): "obvious etymologies are the material from which sound laws are drawn."

The opinion that sound correspondences or, in another version of the opinion, reconstruction of a proto-language are necessary to show relationship between languages thus dates from the 20th, not the 19th century, and was never a position of the Neogrammarians. Indo-European was recognized by scholars such as [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] (1786) and Franz Bopp (1816) long before the development of the comparative method.

Furthermore, Indo-European was not the first language family to be recognized by students of language. [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] had been recognized by European scholars in the 17th century, [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] in the 18th. [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] was recognized in the mid-19th century by [[Robert Caldwell]] (1856), well before the publication of Schleicher's comparative reconstructions.

Finally, the supposition that all of the language families generally accepted by linguists today have been established by the comparative method is untrue. For example, although [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] has long been accepted as a valid family, "Proto-Eskimo–Aleut has not yet been reconstructed" (Bomhard 2008:209). Other families were accepted for decades before comparative reconstructions of them were put forward, for example [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] and [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]]. Many languages are generally accepted as belonging to a language family even though no comparative reconstruction exists, often because the languages are only attested in fragmentary form, such as the [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] language [[Lydian language|Lydian]] (Greenberg 2005:161). Conversely, detailed comparative reconstructions exist for some language families which nonetheless remain controversial, such as [[Altaic languages#Comparative grammar of the proposed Altaic language family|Altaic]] and [[Nostratic languages#Comparative grammar of Nostratic|Nostratic]] (however, a specification is needed here: Nostratic is a proposed proto-proto-language, while Altaic is a "simple" proto-language - with Altaic languages widely accepted as typologically related. Detractors of both proposals simply claim that the data collected to show by comparativism the existence of both families is scarce, wrong and non sufficient. Keep in mind that regular phonological correspondences need thousands of lexicon lists to be prepared and compared before being established. These lists are lacking for both the proposed families. Furthermore, other specific problems affect "comparative" lists of both proposals, like the late attestation for Altaic languages, or the comparison of not certain proto-forms, like proto-Kartvelian, for Nostratic.).&lt;ref name="test1"&gt;[[R.L. Trask]], Historical Linguistics (1996), chapters 8 to 13 for an intensive lookout on language comparison.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test2"&gt;Claudia A. Ciancaglini, "How to prove genetic relationships among languages: the cases of Japanese and Corean", 2005, "La Sapienza" University, Rome&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A continuation of earlier methods? ===

Greenberg claimed that he was at bottom merely continuing the simple but effective method of language classification that had resulted in the discovery of numerous language families prior to the elaboration of the [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] (1955:1-2, 2005:75) and that had continued to do so thereafter, as in the classification of [[Hittite language|Hittite]] as Indo-European in 1917 (Greenberg 2005:160-161). This method consists in essentially two things: resemblances in basic vocabulary and resemblances in inflectional morphemes. If mass comparison differs from it in any obvious way, it would seem to be in the theoretization of an approach that had previously been applied in a relatively ad hoc manner and in the following additions:

*The explicit preference for basic vocabulary over cultural vocabulary.
*The explicit emphasis on comparison of multiple languages rather than bilateral comparisons.
*The very large number of languages simultaneously compared (up to several hundred).
*The introduction of typologically based paths of sound change.

The positions of Greenberg and his critics therefore appear to provide a starkly contrasted alternative:

*According to Greenberg, the identification of sound correspondences and the reconstruction of protolanguages arise from genetic classification.
*According to Greenberg's critics, genetic classification arises from the identification of sound correspondences or (others state) the reconstruction of protolanguages.

=== Time limits of the comparative method ===

Besides systematic changes, languages are also subject to random mutations (such as borrowings from other languages, irregular inflections, compounding, and abbreviation) that affect one word at a time, or small subsets of words. For example, Spanish ''perro'' (dog), which does not come from Latin, cannot be rule-mapped to its Italian equivalent ''cane'' (the Spanish word ''can'' is the Latin-derived equivalent but is much less used in everyday conversations, being reserved for more formal purposes). As those sporadic changes accumulate, they will increasingly obscure the systematic ones—just as enough dirt and scratches on a photograph will eventually make the face unrecognizable.

On this point, Greenberg and his critics agree, as over against the Moscow school, but they draw contrasting conclusions:

*Greenberg's critics argue that the [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] has an inherent limit of 6,000 – 10,000 years (depending on the author), and that beyond this too many irregularities of sound change have accumulated for the method to function. Since according to them the identification of regular sound correspondences is necessary to establish genetic relationship, they conclude that genetic relationships older than 10,000 years (or less) cannot be determined. In consequence, it is not possible to go much beyond those genetic classifications that have already been arrived at (e.g. Ringe 1992:1).
*Greenberg argued that cognates often remain recognizable even when recurrent sound changes have been overlaid by idiosyncratic ones or interrupted by analogy, citing the cases of English ''brother'' (2002:4), which is easily recognizable as a cognate of German ''Bruder'' even though it violates Verner's law, and Latin ''quattuor'' (1957:45), easily recognizable as a reflex of Proto-Indo-European *''{{IPA|kʷetwor}}'' even though the changes ''e'' &gt; ''a'' and ''t'' &gt; ''tt'' violate the usual sound changes from Proto-Indo-European to Latin. (In the case of ''brother'', the sound changes are actually known, but intricate, and are only decipherable because the language is heavily documented from an early date. In the case of ''quattuor'', the changes are genuinely irregular, and the form of the word can only be explained through means other than regular sound change, such as the operation of [[analogy]].)
*In contrast, the "Moscow school" of linguists, perhaps best known for its advocacy of the [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic hypothesis]] (though active in  many other areas), has confidence in the traceability of regular sound changes at very great time depths, and believes that reconstructed proto-languages can be pyramided on top of each other so as to attain still earlier proto-languages, without violating the principles of the standard comparative method.

== Toward a resolution of the conflict? ==

In spite of the apparently intractable nature of the conflict between Greenberg and his critics, a few linguists have begun to argue for its resolution. [[Edward Vajda]], noted for his recent proposal of [[Dené–Yeniseian languages|Dené–Yeniseian]], attempts to stake out a position that is sympathetic to both Greenberg's approach and that of its critics, such as Lyle Campbell and [[Johanna Nichols]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/docs/dy_vajda_perspective.pdf ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518115445/http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/docs/dy_vajda_perspective.pdf |date=May 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgiy Starostin|George Starostin]], a member of the Moscow school, argues that Greenberg's work, while perhaps not going beyond [[inspection]], presents interesting sets of forms that call for further scrutiny by comparative reconstruction, specifically with regard to the proposed Khoisan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://starling.rinet.ru/Texts/khoisan.pdf | title=From Modern Khoisan Languages to Proto-Khoisan: The Value of Intermediate Reconstructions | author=George Starostin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Amerind&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nostratic.ru/books/(316)gell-starostin-jlr1.pdf | title=Distant Language Relationship | author=Murray Gell-Mann | author2= Ilia Peiros | author3=George Starostin | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810021058/http://nostratic.ru/books/(316)gell-starostin-jlr1.pdf | archivedate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; families.

'''[[Mummy|Mummies]]''' are commonly featured in [[horror fiction|horror]] genres as [[undead]] creatures wrapped in bandages.

==History==
The original inspiration for undead mummies comes from the process of [[mummification]].

==Literature==
* One of the earliest examples of undead mummies is ''[[The Mummy!|The Mummy!: Or a Tale of the Twenty-Second Century]]'', an 1827 novel written by [[Jane C. Loudon]]. This early science-fiction work concerns an Egyptian mummy named Cheops, who is brought back in to life in the 22nd century.
* ''[[Lost in a Pyramid; or, The Mummy's Curse]]'' (Louisa May Alcott, 1869) is an early example of the "mummy's curse" genre.
* "[[Lot No. 249]]" by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]
* ''[[The Jewel of Seven Stars]]'' featured a mummy.
* [[EC Comics]]' series ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''[[The Haunt of Fear]]'', and ''[[The Vault of Horror]]'' featured mummies in their stories. ''Tales from the Crypt'' #33 revealed that the Crypt-Keeper's parents are a 4,000-year-old female Egyptian mummy and a two-headed corpse.
* [[Marvel Comics]] has its own mummies including [[N'Kantu, the Living Mummy]].
* The mummies are featured in ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]''.
* The ''[[Goosebumps]]'' franchise featured mummies in its different stories.
** ''The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb'' featured an assortment of mummies.
** ''Return of the Mummy'' featured the Mummy of Prince Kho-ru who was the fictional cousin of [[Tutankhamun|King Tut]].
** ''Diary of a Mad Mummy'' featured the Mummy of King Buthramaman.
** ''The Mummy Walks'' featured the Mummy of Emperor Pukrah of Jekeziah.
** The ''Tales to Give You Goosebumps'' story "Don't Wake Mummy" featured a mummy. The television adaption of this episode also featured the mummy's cat.
** ''Who's Your Mummy'' featured an assortment of mummies.
* ''The Mummy Chronicles'' is a continuation of the Stephen Sommers' Mummy films.

==Television==
* Robot mummies were featured in a ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[Pyramids of Mars]]'' while the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Horror]] film series had also included what had become a stock genre character.
* The TV series ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1970 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' and ''[[Groovie Goolies]]'' feature a Mummy (voiced by [[Howard Morris]] impersonating [[Ed Wynn]]) as a member of the Groovie Goolies.
* The TV series ''[[Drak Pack]]'' features a super-strong mummy named Mummyman (voiced by [[Chuck McCann]]) who is a member of the evil organization OGRE.
* The TV series ''[[Gravedale High]]'' features mummy characters like Cleofatra (voiced by [[Ricki Lake]]) and Mr. Tutner (voiced by [[Tim Curry]]).
* In ''[[Big Bad Beetleborgs]]'', the character Mums is a mummy that resides at Hillhurst.
* The anime franchise for ''[[Digimon]]'' features Mummymon.
* In the ''[[Ben 10]]'' franchise, there is a race of alien mummies called Thep Khufans. Ben Tennyson's alien form Snare-oh (originally called Benmummy) is a Thep Khufan.
* Some Mummy Monsters appeared in ''[[Super Sentai]]'':
** In ''[[Seiju Sentai Gingaman]]'', the monster Morgumorgu is a mummy-themed monster. In ''[[Power Rangers Lost Galaxy]], the monster was adapted as Crumummy.
** In ''[[Kyuukyuu Sentai GoGoFive]]'', the monster Zombeast is a mummy-themed Psyma Beast. In ''[[Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue]]'', the monster was used for one of the unidentified defeated demons in the Shadow World.
** In ''[[Mahou Sentai Magiranger]]'', the villain Sorcery Priest Meemy is a mummy. In ''[[Power Rangers Mystic Force]]'', he is adapted as Imperious.
** In ''[[Tensou Sentai Goseiger]]'', the monster Zeibu of the Mummy is a mummy-like creature with centipede-like features. In ''[[Power Rangers Megaforce]]'', he is adapted as Mummy who is one of the illusions of the monster Distractor.
* In ''[[Ugly Americans (TV series)|Ugly Americans]]'', there are mummies living in Manhattan. One Mummy is revealed to be the mother of Francis Grimes as seen in "Mummy Dearest."
* [[The Jim Henson Company]]'s "Henson Alternative" banner had different mummy characters:
** In ''[[Late Night Liars]]'', the character William A. Mummy (performed by [[Brian Clark (puppeteer)|Brian Clark]]) is one of the main characters. He is a flamboyant mummy who Shelley Oceans' ex-wife and a parody of Paul Lynde.
** In ''[[No, You Shut Up!]]'', Andy Al-Jizah (performed by Brian Clark) is a mummy who is the President of the AAMRP (short for American Association of Mummified and/or Retired People).
* In ''[[Jake and the Neverland Pirates]]'', some people believe that the crook and flail has the power to bring the mummies to life.
* The anime series ''[[Monster Musume]]'' features Mummies where they are depicted as a subspecies of the Zombies. As the desert environments have made their skin dry, the Mummies must take long baths to replenish their fluids and even do this by sucking the life force out of humans to supplement their beauty as a placebo.
* The TV series ''[[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes]]'' features the character Ms. Mummy (voiced by [[Ashly Burch]]) who is a regular of the Lake Plaza Turbo where she lives behind "Gar's Hero Supply &amp; Bodega."

==Film==
During the 20th century, [[horror film]]s and other mass media popularized the notion of a [[curse]] associated with mummies (''see [[Curse of the pharaohs]]''). The 1922 discovery of [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb by archaeologist [[Howard Carter]] brought mummies into the mainstream.

* One of the earliest appearances was ''[[The Jewel of Seven Stars]]'', a [[Horror fiction|horror novel]] by [[Bram Stoker]] first published in 1903 that concerned an archaeologist's plot to revive an ancient Egyptian mummy. This book later served as the basis for the 1971 film ''[[Blood from the Mummy's Tomb]]''.
* Films representing such a belief include the 1932 movie ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' starring [[Boris Karloff]] as [[Imhotep (The Mummy)|Imhotep]]; four subsequent 1940s' [[Universal Studios]] mummy films which featured a mummy named [[Kharis]], and a 1959 Hammer remake of ''[[The Mummy's Hand]]'' and ''[[The Mummy's Tomb]]'' which also featured Kharis. The belief in cursed mummies probably stems in part from the supposed curse on the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]].
* In 1979, the [[American Broadcasting Company]] aired a TV holiday show, ''[[The Halloween That Almost Wasn't]]'', in which a mummy from Egypt (Robert Fitch) arrived at [[Count Dracula]]'s castle without speaking.
* [[Slapstick]] comedy trio [[The Three Stooges]] humorously exploited the discovery in the short film ''[[We Want Our Mummy]]'', in which they explored the tomb of the [[midget]] King Rutentuten (and his Queen, Hotsy Totsy). A decade later, they played crooked used [[chariot]] salesmen in ''[[Mummy's Dummies]]'', in which they ultimately assisted a different King Rootentootin ([[Vernon Dent]]) with a toothache.
* A Mummy was featured in the film ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]''. He does not talk and is among the monsters invited by [[Victor Frankenstein|Baron Boris von Frankenstein]]'s castle on the Isle of Evil. The Mummy's sarcophagus was carried to Baron Frankenstein's castle by the [[Quasimodo|Hunchback]]. In one scene, the Mummy dances with [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Monster's Mate]] to "Do the Mummy" by Little Tibia and Fibias.
* A Mummy was featured in ''[[Mad Mad Mad Monsters]]'' voiced by [[Allen Swift]]. He is among the monsters invited by Baron Henry von Frankenstein to attend the wedding of [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein's Monster]] and his mate at the Transylvania Astoria Hotel on Friday the 13th.
* The [[Disney Channel]] film ''[[Under Wraps (film)|Under Wraps]]'' featured a mummy that was named Harold (performed by [[Bill Fagerbakke]]).
* The ''[[Halloweentown (film series)|Halloweentown]]'' franchise featured different mummies.
* A new Hollywood series of films featuring an immortal undead High Priest began with ''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=catmom-2 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/ |title=The Mummy (1999) |date=7 May 1999 |website=IMDb |accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a box-office success and was followed by two sequels, ''[[The Mummy Returns]]'' in 2001 and ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'' in 2008. The first two movies featured the mummy of Imhotep (portrayed by [[Arnold Vosloo]]) and the third movie featured the mummy of Emperor Han (portrayed by [[Jet Li]]).
* The ''[[Night at the Museum (film series)|Night at the Museum]]'' franchise centers around the tablet of Ahkmenrah (portrayed by [[Rami Malek]]), intended to keep his family together forever, by granting life to his mummy. Later, his parents are also seen in ''[[Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb]]'' with the tablet providing similar effects. Unlike in most portrayals of mummies, the magic is so thorough that the mummies are restored to full life-like appearance as opposed to simple reanimation. 
* The ''[[Hotel Transylvania (franchise)|Hotel Transylvania]]'' franchise features Murray the Mummy (voiced by [[CeeLo Green]] in the [[Hotel Transylvania|first movie]], [[Keegan-Michael Key]] in the [[Hotel Transylvania 2|second movie]]) as one of the main characters. In addition, there was also a female mummy that made background cameos.

In [[Zapotec people|Zapotec]] cultures of [[Oaxaca]] (southern [[Mexico]]), a '''muxe''' (also spelled '''muxhe'''; {{IPA-all|muʃeʔ|}}) is an [[Sex assignment|assigned male at birth]] individual who dresses and behaves in ways otherwise associated with the female [[gender]]; they may be seen as a [[third gender]].&lt;ref&gt;Chiñas, Beverly (1995). ''Isthmus Zapotec attitudes toward sex and gender anomalies,'' pp. 293-302 in Stephen O. Murray (ed.), "Latin American Male Homosexualities" Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press.&lt;br&gt;Chiñas (p. 294) defines muxe as "persons who appear to be predominantly male but display certain female characteristics" and fill a "third gender role between men and women, taking some of the characteristics of each."&lt;/ref&gt; Some marry women and have children while others choose men as sexual or romantic partners.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen, Lynn (2002). "Latin American Perspectives," Issue 123, Vol.29 No.2, March 2002, pp. 41-59. {{cite web |url= http://www.uky.edu/~tmute2/mexico/MexWeb/Mex+PDFs/stephan-gender-zapotec.pdf |title= ''Sexualities and Genders in Zapotec Oaxaca.'' |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070129073904/http://www.uky.edu/~tmute2/mexico/MexWeb/Mex%20PDFs/stephan-gender-zapotec.pdf |archivedate= 2007-01-29 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(98.6&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to anthropologist Lynn Stephen, muxe "may do certain kinds of women’s work such as embroidery or decorating home altars, but others do the male work of making jewelry".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibid.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MIANO, M. (2002). Hombre, mujer y muxe’ en el Istmo de Tehuantepec. México: Plaza
y Valdés. CONACULTA-INAH.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''{{wiktspa|muxe}}'' is thought to derive from the Spanish word for "woman", ''{{wiktspa|mujer}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://origin-www.goethe.de/mmo/priv/4038800-STANDARD.pdf|title=Muxe: el tercer sexo|last=Bennholdt-Thomsen|first=Veronika|date=|work=|year=2008|agency=Goethe Institut|language=Spanish|access-date=March 13, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th-century, the letter ''x'' had a sound similar to "sh" (see {{Section link|History of the Spanish language|Modern development of the Old Spanish sibilants}}).

==Muxe and gender in Zapotec culture==
In contrast to Mexico's majority ''[[mestizo]]'' culture, the [[isthmus]] of Oaxaca has a predominantly Zapotec population, and it is widely reported that there is less hostility toward muxe in the region than what homosexual, effeminate males, and [[trans woman|trans women]] face in other regions of the country. One study estimates that 6 percent of males in an [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec|Isthmus]] Zapotec community in the early 1970s were muxe.&lt;ref&gt;Rymph, David (1974). ''Cross-sex behavior in an Isthmus Zapotec village.'' Paper presented at the annual meeting of the [[American Anthropological Association]], Mexico City.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Zapotec communities have similar "third gender" roles, such as the ''[[biza’ah]]'' of [[Teotitlán del Valle]].

Muxe may be ''vestidas'' (wearing female clothes) or ''pintadas'' (wearing male clothes and make-up). It has been suggested that while the three gender system predates Spanish colonization, the phenomenon of muxe dressing as women is fairly recent, beginning in the 1950s and gaining popularity until nearly all of the younger generation of muxe today are ''vestidas''.&lt;ref name="GomezRegalado"&gt;Gómez Regalado, Amaranta (2005) {{cite web |url= http://www.2spirits.com/TrascendiendoEnglishversion.pdf |title= ''Transcending.'' |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070113131128/http://www.2spirits.com/TrascendiendoEnglishversion.pdf |archivedate= 2007-01-13 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(50.0&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within contemporary Zapotec culture, reports vary as to their social status. Muxe in village communities may not be disparaged and highly respected, while in larger, more Westernised towns they may face some discrimination, especially from men due to attitudes introduced by Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen, Lynn, [[op cit]].&lt;/ref&gt; Muxe generally belong to the poorer classes of society. Gender variance and same-sex desire in wealthier communities of the region are more likely to follow a more western taxonomy of gay, bisexual and transgender. Such individuals are also more likely to remain in "[[the closet]]". Despite this, Muxe have traditionally been considered good luck, worth more than [[cisgender]] women and many now have white-collar jobs or are involved in politics.

In an article published in 1995, anthropologist [[Beverly Chiñas]] explains that in the Zapotec culture, "the idea of choosing gender or of sexual orientation is as ludicrous as suggesting that one can choose one's skin color."&lt;ref&gt;Chiñas, Beverly (1995). ''Isthmus Zapotec attitudes toward sex and gender anomalies,'' pp. 293-302 in Stephen O. Murray (ed.), "Latin American Male Homosexualities" Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press&lt;/ref&gt; Most people traditionally view their gender as something God has given them (whether man, woman, or muxe), and few muxe desire genital surgery. They generally do not suffer from gender dysphoria because transphobia is a rare attitude in their culture, people are generally accepting of them and they usually have their gender recognised through their clothing, there is not as much pressure to "pass" as in Western societies.

Lynn Stephen writes: "Muxe men are not referred to as "homosexuals" but constitute a separate category based on gender attributes. People perceive them as having the physical bodies of men but different aesthetic, work, and social skills from most men. They may have some attributes of women or combine those of men and women." If they do choose men as sexual partners, neither are those men (known as ''mayate'') necessarily considered homosexual.

==Prominent muxe individuals==
In 2003, 25-year-old muxe [[:es:Amaranta Gómez Regalado|Amaranta Gómez Regalado]] from [[Juchitán de Zaragoza]] gained international prominence as a congressional candidate for the [[México Posible]] party in the [[2003 Mexican elections|Oaxaca state elections]]. Her broad platform included calls for the decriminalization of marijuana and abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2003/06/05/ls-amaranta.html|title=La nueva visibilidad lésbico-gay|last=Medina|first=Antonio|date=June 5, 2003|work=LETRA S|access-date=March 13, 2016|via=La Jornada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=//www.copenhagen2009.org/Conference/Keynote_Speakers/Amaranta_Gomez_Regalado.aspx |title=Archived profile from Amaranta Gómez Regalado for the WorldOut Games in Copenhagen 2009 |last= |first= |date=January 11, 2016 |website=Amaranta Gómez Regalado – WorldOut Games 2009 |publisher=Wayback Machine Internet Archive |access-date=March 13, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721073144/http://www.copenhagen2009.org/Conference/Keynote_Speakers/Amaranta_Gomez_Regalado.aspx |archivedate=July 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lukas Avendaño is an emerging Mexican [[performance art]]ist whose recent work constitutes a queer [[Performatism|performatic]] intervention of Mexican nationalistic representations, particularly that of Zapotec [[Tehuantepec|Tehuana]] women. Avendaño embodies the complex identity of muxes, or male homosexuals from the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec|Tehuantepec Isthmus]] where he was born. His cross-dressing performance interweaves ritual dances with autobiographical passages and actions that involve audience members, in order to challenge the widely held view of a gay-friendly indigenous culture and point towards the existence of lives that negotiate pain and loneliness with self-affirming pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stambaugh|first=Antonio Prieto|date=2014-01-01|title=RepresentaXión" de un muxe: la identidad performática de Lukas Avendaño|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/latin_american_theatre_review/v048/48.1.stambaugh.html|journal=Latin American Theatre Review|volume=48|issue=1|pages=31–53|doi=10.1353/ltr.2014.0030|issn=2161-0576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''online exhibition''', also referred to as a '''virtual exhibition''', '''online gallery''', '''cyber-exhibition''', is an [[exhibition]] whose venue is [[cyberspace]].

[[Museum]]s and other organizations create online exhibitions for many reasons.
For example, an online exhibition may: expand on material presented at, or generate interest in, or create a durable online record of, a physical exhibition;  save production costs (insurance, shipping, installation); solve conservation/preservation problems (e.g., handling of fragile or rare objects); reach lots more people: "Access to information is no longer restricted to those who can afford travel and museum visits, but is available to anyone who has access to a computer with an Internet connection.

Unlike physical exhibitions, online exhibitions are not restricted by time; they are not forced to open and close but may be available 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aam-us.org/pubs/mn/MN_SO02_OnlineVisitor.cfm | title=Going Global: Reaching Out for the Online Visitor | author=Klaus Müller | publisher=American Association of Museums | accessdate=October 6, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nonprofit world, many museums, [[libraries]], [[archives]], [[universities]], and other cultural organizations create online exhibitions. A database of such exhibitions is [[Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web]]. Online exhibitions are also increasingly being utilized by businesses and individuals.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Online exhibition organizers may use techniques such as [[Marquee element|marquee text]], [[Display advertising|display advertisement]]s, and in-event [[email]]s to engage patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.inxpo.com/casting-calls/bid/74900/4-Tips-to-Engage-and-Inform-Attendees-in-Your-Digital-Event|title=4 Tips to Engage and Inform Attendees in Your Digital Event|last=Wolf|first=Lauren|date=11 October 2011|publisher=INXPO|accessdate=3 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714143642/http://web.inxpo.com/casting-calls/bid/74900/4-Tips-to-Engage-and-Inform-Attendees-in-Your-Digital-Event|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=September 2017}}

Various guides have been published to help organizations create effective online exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Thiel, S. (2007). ''Build It Once: A Basic Primer for the Creation of Online Exhibitions.'' The Scarecrow Press, Inc. {{ISBN|081085225X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalfatovic, M. (2002). ''Creating a Winning Online Exhibition: A Guide for Libraries, Archives, and Museums.'' American Library Association. {{ISBN|0838908179}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest museum with a physical existence to create a programme of substantial online exhibitions with high resolution images of artefacts was the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford, the first of which, ''The Measurers: a Flemish Image of Mathematics in the Sixteenth Century'' and an exhibition of early photographs, were published on 21 August 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/measurer/text/title.htm The Measurers: a Flemish Image of Mathematics in the Sixteenth Century]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/features/ephotos/text.htm An exhibition of early photographs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also popular now are virtual exhibitions for business, participation in which allows you to save significant funds and cover a larger number of potential customers, without restriction on the place and time. &lt;ref&gt;[https://expo-online.center/ An example of an online platform with virtual exhibitions for business]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of online exhibitions==
In recent years, new [[virtual museum]]s have published online exhibitions as : 
* [[UMA - Universal Museum of Art]] is an online-only museum which launched 2017. It has the ambition to work universal in virtual reality and is based on two principles: accessibility and innovation. UMA is offering exhibitions through the world art history, it's not connected to one top topic, country or region.
* [[International Museum of Women]] is an online-only museum that does not have a physical building and instead offers online exhibitions about women's issues globally as well as an online community. Online exhibitions include "Imagining Ourselves" (launched 2006) about women's identity, "Women, Power and Politics" (2008), and "Economica: Women and the Global Economy" (2009).
* [[Tucson LGBTQ Museum]] is an online-only museum that does not have a physical building and instead offers online exhibitions about LGBTQ history. The online photographic, audio, video, text, and other historical exhibitions include exhibits from the 1700s to the present day. The effort began in the summer of 1967 and spanned almost 50 years. 
* [[International New Media Gallery]] (INMG) is an online museum specialising in moving image and screen-based art. The INMG is dedicated to exploring current debates and topics in art history: touching on areas such as migration, war, environmental activism and the internet itself. The gallery publishes extensive academic catalogues alongside its exhibitions. It also hosts spaces for discussion and debate, both online and offline.
* [[Virtual Museum of Modern Nigerian Art]] – the VMMNA is the first of its kind in Africa. Hosted by the [[Pan-African University, Lagos]], Nigeria this virtual museum offers a good view of the development on Nigerian Art in the past fifty years.

'''Patrick Miller Hemingway''' (born June 28, 1928) is [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s second son, and the first born to Hemingway's second wife [[Pauline Pfeiffer]].&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; During his childhood he travelled frequently with his parents, and then attended [[Harvard University]], graduated in 1950, and shortly thereafter moved to [[East Africa]] where he lived for 25 years. In [[Tanzania]], Patrick was a professional [[big-game hunter]] and for over a decade he owned a [[safari]] business.&lt;ref name=Papers/&gt; In the 1960s he was appointed by the [[United Nations]]  to the Wildlife Management College in Tanzania as a teacher of conservation and wildlife. In the 1970s he moved to [[Montana]] where he manages the intellectual property of his father's estate. He edited his father's unpublished novel about a 1950s safari to Africa and published it with the title ''[[True at First Light]]'' (1999).

==Personal life==
Born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]],&lt;ref name=Oliver/&gt; he traveled with his parents to Europe in 1929 and again in 1933, to [[Wyoming]] and [[Idaho]] during his summers, though his permanent residence was in [[Key West]].&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mellow pp. 385–427&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =mtnexpress&gt;[http://www.mtexpress.com/index2.php?issue_date=09-14-2005&amp;ID=2005105289 Hemingway on Hemingway] Idaho Mountain Express. Retrieved 2010-02-09&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, his parents divorced, after which his father married [[Martha Gellhorn]]. After their marriage, they moved to [[Cuba]] where Patrick visited often.&lt;ref name="Mellow p. 523"&gt;Mellow p. 523&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of World War II, Patrick helped crew his father's boat, the Pilar, on improvised attack missions in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Mellow p. 523"/&gt; Patrick attended [[Stanford University]] for two years, transferred to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and graduated in 1950 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[History]] and [[Literature]].&lt;ref name=PH&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |year=1999 |title=About Patrick Hemingway|journal=The Hemingway Review |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=6 |url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick was married to Henrietta Broyles, with whom he has a daughter, Mina Hemingway (born 1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Torralbas|first1=Kathy|title=Hemingway's granddaughter's bookstore serves niche market in Naples|url=http://archive.naplesnews.com/business/hemingways-granddaughters-bookstore-serves-niche-market-in-naples-ep-405339789-330679171.html/|website=Naples Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Usul al-fiqh}}
'''Recommended precaution''' ({{Lang-ar|احتياط مستحب |translit=Ihtiyat [[Mustahabb]]}}) is a [[fiqh]] term, prominently used by [[Shi'a]] [[Marja'|marja]]s when giving [[fatwa]]s. Ihtiyat is an action in  such a way that including certain knowledge to original Taklif. This term considered from two view: first one is Usuli view and the other juridical perspective (fiqh). In Usuli view, Ihtiyat is concerned with the [[principle of Ihtiyat]] while in juridical view, Ihtiyat dealt with Ijtihad, Imitation and Qisas.

==Definition==

There are many definitions for recommended precaution (Ihtiyat) in [[fiqh]] books and essays. Ihtiyat obsereved in where the man of jurisprudence doesn't say anythying about fatwa and in other hand jurists choose the way of imitation freely.sometimes Ihtiyat is to action of Mokallaf (one who must act religious tasks)in such a way that the one find definite knowledge of original task. Ihtiyat sometimes is along with  the repetition of action and sometimes with is not along with.also there is a difference between Ihtiyat in fatwa and giving fatwa in recommended precaution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.eshia.ir/27583/1/440/%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B7|title=کتابخانه مدرسه فقاهت - دائرة المعارف فقه مقارن - ناصر مكارم شيرازى|publisher=lib.eshia.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ihtiyat literally means preservation and keeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.eshia.ir/71601/1/98|title=کتابخانه مدرسه فقاهت - فرهنگ نامه اصول فقه - مرکز اطلاعات و منابع اسلامی|publisher=lib.eshia.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; caution concerned primarily with action but Tavaqqof with creating rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=omQCeF7PJlIC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=Ihtiyat%20in%20Fiqh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVo7Ss8aTMAhVEthoKHUpJA5UQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Ihtiyat%20in%20Fiqh&amp;f=false|title=Islamic Law: Theory and Practice|first1=Robert|last1=Gleave|first2=Eugenia|last2=Kermeli|date=21 April 2001|publisher=I.B.Tauris|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Ihtiyat==

There are many divisions in Ihtiyat and its types. Ihtiyat divided in one hand into Indispensipble, Mostahab and needed and in other hand in respect to Action, not action and collection of action and not action.

==Ihtiyat in Quran==

Three groups of verses refers to indispensability of Ihtiyat.

*First group refers to those verses which point to forbidding talking about something without having knowledge.{{quote|(O man), follow not that whereof thou hast no knowledge. Lo! the hearing and the sight and the heart - of each of these it will be asked.|{{cite quran|17|36}}}}

{{quote|Then verily We shall question those unto whom (Our message) hath been sent, and verily We shall question the messengers|{{cite quran|7|33}}}}

*Second group refers to those verses in which pointed to firbidding the annahilation of souls of human.

{{quote|Spend your wealth for the cause of Allah, and be not cast by your own hands to ruin; and do good. Lo! Allah loveth the beneficent. |{{cite quran|2|195}}}}

*Third group refers to those verses that in which pointed to order to taghwa(avoiding).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.eshia.ir/71601/1/59|title=کتابخانه مدرسه فقاهت - فرهنگ نامه اصول فقه - مرکز اطلاعات و منابع اسلامی|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Spend your wealth for the cause of Allah, and be not cast by your own hands to ruin; and do good. Lo! Allah loveth the beneficent. |{{cite quran|3|102}}}}

{{quote| So keep your duty to Allah as best ye can, and listen, and obey, and spend; that is better for your souls. And whoso is saved from his own greed, such are the successful. |{{cite quran|64|16}}}}

When Shi'a marjas give fatwas, they sometimes are not sure about the legality of some issues. In those cases, they recommend that the follower of the marja refrain from the act, in case it would indeed be [[haraam|haram]]. This is in contrast to the general term [[Mustahabb]], where people voluntarily do or refrain from doing actions that they know they are ''not'' obliged to.

As example:
:''It is a '''recommended precaution''' that even a child should not be made to sit in the toilet with its face or back facing [[Qibla]]. But if the child positions itself that way, it is not obligatory to divert it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafed.net/books/other-lang/masael-e/masael-e02.html|title=المکتبة الإسلامية|publisher=rafed.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rubbing''' (''[[Frottage (art)|frottage]]'') is a reproduction of the [[Surface finish|texture]] of a surface created by placing a piece of paper or similar material over the subject and then rubbing the paper with something to deposit marks, most commonly [[charcoal]] or [[pencil]], but also various forms of blotted and rolled ink, [[chalk]], [[wax]], and many other substances. For all its simplicity, the  technique can be used to produce blur-free images of minuscule elevations and depressions on areas of any size in a way that can hardly be matched by even the most elaborate, state-of-the-art methods. In this way, surface elevations measuring only a few thousandths of a millimeter can be made visible.&lt;ref&gt;Lukowsky, D., ''Failure Analysis of Wood and Wood-Based Products'', McGraw-Hill Education; 1st edition (2015) {{ISBN|978-0-07-183937-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Santo Bambino of Aracoeli''' ("Holy Boy of Aracoeli"), sometimes known as the '''Bambino Gesù di Aracoeli''' ("Child Jesus of Aracoeli") is a 15th-century Roman Catholic devotional wooden image enshrined in the titular Basilica of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli]], depicting the [[Christ Child|Child Jesus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://santatatiana.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/the-miraculous-bambino-gesu/|title=The Miraculous Bambino Gesu|work=Italian Slow Walks|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; swaddled in golden fabric, wearing a crown, and adorned with various gemstones and jewels donated by devotees.

On 18 January 1894, [[Pope Leo XIII]] authorised its public devotion and granted a [[canonical coronation]] on 2 May 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marina Carta|author2=Laura Russo|title=S. Maria in Aracoeli|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iik3AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA218|year=1988|publisher=Istituto nazionale di studi romani|pages=215–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was again blessed by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 8 January 1984. The image was stolen in 1 February 1994, then replaced with a copy while the original statue itself resides in the Church of Saint John the Baptist in [[Cori, Lazio]], where it is under secured custody by the [[Salviati family|Salviati]]-[[House of Borghese|Borghese clan]], which asserts claim of rightful ownership of the image per local tradition dating back to the 18th century.  
 
==History and devotions==
The wooden image measures approximately 60 centimeters tall and depicts the Child Jesus as an infant. According to historical records preserved at the Basilica Santa Maria in Aracoeli, the image was carved from a single block of [[olive wood]] from the [[Garden of Gethsemani]] by a Franciscan friar assigned to the [[Holy Land]] in the fifteenth century.

Pilgrimages to the images are recorded as early as 1794. In February 1798, the image was seized by French troops but ransomed by Roman aristocrat Serafin Petraca, thus saving it from being burned.&lt;ref name=darang/&gt; It remained in a convent in [[Trastevere]] for a little over a year while a new shrine was built. In 1838, thieves, ostensibly bending to kiss the image, made off with a considerable part of the jewelry with which he was adorned. During [[anti-Catholic]] protests in 1848, [[Carlo Armellini]] saved the Santo Bambino from arson.&lt;ref name=repubblica/&gt;

===Traditions===
Romans have long associated the image with healing.&lt;ref name="Liverotti"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abitarearoma.net/curiosita-e-leggende-sulla-statua-del-santo-bambino-custodita-nella-chiesa-di-santa-maria-in-aracoeli/#.VpnAR-T2bIU|title=Curiosità e leggende sulla statua del Santo Bambino custodita nella chiesa di Santa Maria in Aracoeli|date=2008-12-11|work=Abitare A Roma|access-date=2018-08-01|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one account, sometime in the 1800s a member of the noble Torlonia family became seriously ill and the friars were asked to bring the Santo Bambino to the sickbed. The friars obliged and the person recovered. Thereafter, [[Alessandro Torlonia, 2nd Prince di Civitella-Cesi|Prince Alessandro Torlonia]] used a carriage that belonged to Pope Leo XIII to spend his Thursdays bringing the image on "house calls" to the sick unable to visit the Basilica. Until the beginning of the 20th century, a coach of Prince Torlonia was available day and night to bring the Santo Bambino to the bedside of a sick person.&lt;ref name="Nersinger"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://de.zenit.org/articles/il-santo-bambino-das-heilige-kind-von-rom/|title=„Il Santo Bambino“: Das heilige Kind von Rom – ZENIT – Deutsch|website=de.zenit.org|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the chapel is filled with letters from all over the world, some of them addressed only to "Il Bambino, Rome". To make room for new letters, several weeks' worth of old ones are removed and burned with some incense. These are left unopened because, as a Franciscan custodian of the image puts it, "What is in the letters, is a matter between the Bambino and the letter writer and does not concern us." &lt;ref name=Nersinger/&gt; 

At Christmas, the Bambino is customarily placed in the [[Nativity scene|crèche]] at the Basilica. Another custom is, in the period between Christmas and Epiphany, to have children of six to ten years of age stand on a specially built platform to speak to the Bambino. This has fallen out of practice, having been replaced by the mainstream religious procession.

==Pontifical recognitions==
[[File:Basilica di Santa Maria in Ara Coeli, interno 00.JPG|thumb|The high altar of Basilica of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli]].]]

* On 18 January 1894, Pope Leo XIII authorised the devotion to the image, along with a [[rescript]] and prayer dedicated to the infancy of Jesus. The papal document was witnessed by Cardinal [[Ignatius Persico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rector Ecclesiae s.

* The image was also mentioned in a 1969 letter to the [[College of Cardinals]] given by [[Pope Paul VI]] for the 1969 World Day of Peace on New Year's Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS%2061%201969%20-%20ocr.pdf|format=PDF|title=FRANCESCO|publisher=Vatican.va|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On 8 January 1984, Pope John Paul II issued a homily blessing the title and its image at the Pope [[Paul VI Audience Hall]] on the solemn occasion of Jubilee year for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1984/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19840108_giubileo-bambini_it.html|title=Celebrazione del giubileo dei bambini, 8 gennaio 1984|publisher=Vatican.va|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theft of the image==
The statue itself was adorned with valuable ''[[ex-voto]]s''. It was customarily stored at night in a secured cabinet, but on 1 February 1994 at approximately 4:00 PM, two thieves masqueraded as workers on a scaffold erected in the monastery for renovations. By one account, the thieves ransacked the friars' rooms looking for valuables, and coming to the room where the image was stored at night, found the armored cabinet open. Another version says the statue was still on display in the Basilica's crèche, which was to be removed the next day. 

While the police believed it would be difficult to recover any of the gold and valuables taken with the image, they considered the Santo Bambino too well-known to be easily marketed.&lt;ref name="repubblica"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/02/02/rubato-il-bambinello-dell-ara-coeli.html|title=RUBATO IL BAMBINELLO DELL' ARA COELI - la Repubblica.it|work=Archivio - la Repubblica.it|access-date=2018-08-01|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theft of the Santo Bambino caused considerable outrage in Rome. A number of rich individuals offered to underwrite a ransom, but the Franciscans discouraged that approach and proceeded to have a copy made. The inmates at the [[Regina Coeli (prison)|Regina Coeli prison]] even wrote a petition to their anonymous "colleagues", asking for its return.&lt;ref name=Nersinger/&gt; That having failed, they donated money for the new copy.

Accordingly, the original statue is also venerated today in the Church of San Giovanni in Giulianello in [[Cori, Lazio]], where it is revered and under secured custody of the Salviati and Borghese clan, while the 1994 copy remains at Santa Maria in Araceoli. &lt;ref name=Liverotti/&gt; Pious tradition in Cori maintains that in the 18th century, the [[Papal household|Prefect of Pontifical Household]], Cardinal Scipione Borghese, [[Archbishop]] of Teodosia (now suppressed), donated the image to the Church of San Giovanni in Giulianello in an effort to prevent the image from being stolen or desecrated by left-wing [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin militants]]. A solar [[brooch]] depicting the allegorical image ''Sun of Justice'' was attached to the image, later stolen, and was associated with the Milanese jeweller Carlo Sartore. The Sun of Justice is depicted in older 19th-century [[lithographs]] of the image.

==Legends==
Pious tradition holds that when the friar did not have the paints necessary to finish his work, it was completed by an angel. Upon his return to Italy, the ship was wrecked during a storm. The friar survived and later found the statue washed up on the shore at Livorno.&lt;ref name=darang/&gt;

A second tale recounts that in 1797, the [[Pauline Bonaparte|Princess Paolina Borghese]] wishing to have the statue for herself, had a copy made. When her cousin became gravely ill, the family requested that the Bambino be brought, but returned the copy. However, at midnight while the bells rang at Santa Maria in Araceoli, the statue miraculously returned to its rightful place, thus inspiring the famous [[urban legend]] tale of a Roman noblewoman pretending to be sick with the ulterior motive to take the image to her home.&lt;ref name=Liverotti/&gt;

According to tradition, the lips of the Holy Child turn red when a request is going to be granted, and white when the cause presented is hopeless.&lt;ref name=Liverotti/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2907">[[File:Innsbruck Annasäule from c.N.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|St. Anne's Column in Innsbruck's city centre]]

'''St. Anne's Column''' ({{lang-de|Annasäule}}) stands in the city centre of [[Innsbruck]] on ''[[Maria-Theresien-Straße, Innsbruck|Maria-Theresien-Straße]]''.

It was given its name when, in 1703, the last [[Bavaria]]n troops were driven from the [[Tyrol]] on [[St. Anne's Day]] (26 July), as part of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. In 1704, in gratitude, the ''[[Landstände]]'' vowed to build a monument commemorating the event.

The column was made by Trient sculptor, Cristoforo Benedetti, from red [[Kramsach]] marble. On the base are four statues of saints:
* in the north, [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]
* in the west, [[Cassian of Imola|Cassian]], patron saint of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bolzano-Brixen|Diocese of Bozen-Brixen]].
* in the east, [[Vigilius of Trent|Vigilius]], patron saint of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trento|Diocese of Trient]].
* in the south, [[Saint George]] with dragon and lance, then and since 2006, patron saint (now together with [[Saint Joseph]])
Towering above these four statues is the column with its statue of Mary as the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]].

The column was consecrated on 26 July 1706 by [[Prince-Bishop]] Kaspar Ignaz, Count of Künigl. It has been restored several times over the centuries. In 1958, mainly for conservation reasons, the figure of Mary was replaced by a replica and the original was loaned to the [[Abbey of St. Georgenberg-Fiecht]], where it has been placed in a side chapel of the abbey church of Fiecht (near [[Schwaz]]) above Saint Mary's altar.

On 10 October 2009 the figures of saints on the base of the monument were also substituted; the originals are now on the first floor of the Altes Landhaus in Innsbruck.

Despite the merger, Tahrir al-Sham has been accused of working as [[al-Qaeda]]'s Syrian branch on a covert level, and that many of the group's senior figures, particularly Abu Jaber, held similarly extreme views.&lt;ref name="al-Qaeda's grand plan"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://stopterrorfinance.org/stories/511082466-al-qaeda-s-grand-plan-for-syria-passes-through-hayat-tahrir-al-sham |title=Al-Qaeda's Grand Plan for Syria Passes Through Hayat Tahrir al-Sham |first=CATF|last=Reports|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38934206|title=Tahrir al-Sham: Al-Qaeda's latest incarnation in Syria|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tahrir al-Sham has officially denied being part of al-Qaeda and said in a statement that the group is "an independent entity and not an extension of previous organizations or factions".&lt;ref name=jaber/&gt; Additionally, some factions such as Nour al-Din al-Zenki, which was part of the merger, were once supported by the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/terror-list-omission-1.4114621 |title=Why Syria's al-Qaeda affiliate is no longer on Canada's terror list|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia claims that Tahrir al-Sham shares al-Nusra Front's goal of turning Syria into an Islamic emirate run by al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name="worrisome"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/russia-finds-new-jihadist-coalition-syria-worrisome-foreign-ministry/|title=Russia finds new jihadist coalition in Syria 'worrisome': Foreign Ministry |first=News|last=Desk|date=22 February 2017|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation===
[[Abdullah al-Muhaysini]], Abu Taher al-Hamawi, and [[Abdelrazzak Mehdi|Abd ar-Razzaq al-Mahdi]] worked on the formation of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=825807698423906304|user=ajaltamimi|title=#Syria: One might understand the...|accessdate=28 February 2017|date= 29 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January 2017, the date of their formation  that Tahrir al-Sham was formed, the group announced the formation of its elite units, the "Inghimasi", some of whom were deployed in [[Idlib]] city. They could also be used for suicide infiltration operations and as assault troops.&lt;ref name="Jihadist elite units"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/video-jihadist-coalition-forms-elite-unit-combat-syrian-army/|title=VIDEO: Jihadist coalition forms elite unit to combat the Syrian Army|first=Chris|last=Tomson|date=14 March 2017|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=September 2017}}

===Consolidation of power (2017)===
[[File:Hayat Tahrir al-Sham fighters in Mushairfa, northeastern Hama.png|250px|left|thumb|Fighters of Tahrir al-Sham in the village of Mushairfa, northeast of [[Hama]], during the [[Northeastern Hama offensive (2017)|northeastern Hama offensive]] in October 2017.]]
On 30 January, there were reports of mobilizations by Tahrir al-Sham and [[Ahrar al-Sham]] at the [[Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing]] and other nearby areas, and that the two groups were preparing for another round of clashes.{{cn|date=November 2018}} On 30 January, it was reported that there were around 31,000 fighters in Tahrir al-Sham,&lt;ref name="surfacing" /&gt; while in March analyst Charles Lister described is as "likely commanding 12,000 to 14,000 fighters".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lister,

Soon after the group's formation, many local Syrians began referring to the group as '''Hetesh''', which was an Arabic acronym meant as a pejorative, similar the "Daesh" label applied to ISIL by much of the Arab World. This labeling indicated that many Syrians saw Tahrir al-Sham as no different than ISIL, especially given the similarities between Tahrir al-Sham's recent attacks and ISIL's massive offensive on rebel forces in 2014.&lt;ref name="reshapes"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://henryjacksonsociety.org/2017/02/06/analysis-al-qaeda-reshapes-the-insurgency-in-northern-syria/ |title= Analysis: 'Al-Qaeda Reshapes the Insurgency in Northern Syria' |date= 6 February 2017 |author= Kyle Orton |publisher= [[Henry Jackson Society]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170210104907/http://henryjacksonsociety.org/2017/02/06/analysis-al-qaeda-reshapes-the-insurgency-in-northern-syria/ |archivedate= 10 February 2017 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HTS suffered losses from air attacks by Coalition forces. On 1 February 2017, pro-government media reported that the US had conducted an airstrike on Carlton Hotel, in the city of Idlib, which was used by Tahrir al-Sham's former al-Nusra component for troop housing, and hosting meetings of prominent commanders,&lt;ref name="US airstrike on Carlton Hotel"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/us-led-coalition-airstrike-targets-carlton-hotel-idlib-city/ |title= US-led Coalition airstrike targets Carlton Hotel in Idlib city |first=Andrew |last= Illingworth |date= 1 February 2017 |publisher= [[Al-Masdar News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=September 2017}} although opposition sources said the hotel was used by the [[Syrian Arab Red Crescent]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://syriadirect.org/news/syrian-arab-red-crescent-center-in-idlib-city-badly-damaged-in-airstrike/ Syrian Arab Red Crescent center in Idlib city badly damaged in unclaimed airstrike], ''SyriaDirect'' 1 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;, and US involvement has not been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/02/09/asssessing-the-claim-that-the-us-bombed-an-aid-hq-in-syria/ Assessing the Claim that the United States Bombed an Aid Headquarters in Syria], ''Bellingcat'' February 9, 2017 By Christiaan Triebert&lt;/ref&gt;  On the same day, the Elite Division of the FSA was attacked by Tahrir al-Sham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=827284919546109953|user=badly_xeroxed|title=Urgent: Tahrir al-Sham attack #FSA Al...|accessdate=28 February 2017|date= 2 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=September 2017}} On 3 February, a US airstrike struck a Tahrir al-Sham headquarters&lt;ref name="strikes down" /&gt; in [[Sarmin]], killing 12 members of HTS and [[Jund al-Aqsa]]. 10 of the killed militants were HTS members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-airstrikes-idUSKBN15I1YY |title= Air strikes kill 12 fighters in Syria's Idlib: monitor |work=Reuters |date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="11 terrorists killed" /&gt; The airstrike also killed militant commander Ibrahim al-Rihaal Abu Bakr.&lt;ref name="strikes down" /&gt;

On 11 March 2017, Tahrir al-Sham carried out a [[March 2017 Damascus bombings|twin bombing attack]] in the Bab al-Saghir area of Damascus's Old City, killing 76 and wounding 120.

===2018===
In early 2018, there were reports that HTS had been significantly weakened, and now had "a small presence in Eastern Ghouta and declining influence in Idlib, northern Hama, and western Aleppo provinces", with just 250 men in Eastern Ghouta&lt;ref name="Petkova 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Petkova | first=Mariya | title=Where is al-Qaeda in Syria? | website=Al Jazeera | date=1 March 2018 | url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/al-qaeda-syria-180301152110387.html | access-date=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Tahrir al-Sham was accused of killing Fayez al-Madani, an opposition delegate tasked with negotiations with the government over [[electricity delivery]] in the northern [[Homs Governorate]], in the city of [[al-Rastan]]. Hundreds of people, including fighters of the Men of God Brigade, part of the [[Free Syrian Army]]'s National Liberation Movement group,&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wordpress.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aI3yAmNGW1vLpJCOrhiVLqpUUIX9PG1RNsCqJGGfhxI/edit|title=Syrian Civil War factions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proceeded to demonstrate against HTS in the city on 13 February. In response, HTS withdrew from Rastan and handed over its headquarters in the city to the Men of God Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syriadirect.org/news/hts-leaves-north-homs-town-following-civilian-protests/|title=HTS leaves north Homs town following civilian protests|work=[[Syria Direct]]|date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A breakaway faction of former HTS members was formed in February 2018, called the [[Guardians of Religion Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://syrianwardaily.wordpress.com/2018/02/28/syrian-war-daily-28th-of-february-2018/|title=Syrian War Daily – 28th of February 2018|work=Syrian War Daily|date=28 February 2018|author=Joško Barić}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|[[WP:SPS]]|date=September 2018}} 

HTS was left excluded of the 24 February ceasefire agreement on Eastern Ghouta. In late February, a group of armed factions, including [[Failaq al-Rahman]] and [[Jaysh al-Islam]], wrote to the UN declaring they were ready to "evacuate" remaining HTS fighters from Eastern Ghouta within 15 days.&lt;ref name="Petkova 2018"/&gt; At the same time in Idlib Governorate, Ahrar al-Sham, Nour al-Din al-Zinki and Soqour al-Sham entered into [[Syrian Liberation Front–Tahrir al-Sham conflict|conflict with HTS]], taking significant territory.&lt;ref name="Petkova 2018"/&gt;

==Ideology and governance==
Abu Jaber, one of Tahrir al-Sham's leaders, has [[Salafist jihadist]] beliefs. This has resulted in him being arrested several times by the [[Syrian government]]. He was imprisoned at the [[Sednaya Prison]] in 2005 and released among several jihadist prisoners in 2011 who would form several Salafist rebel groups during the Syrian Civil War.&lt;ref name=jaber/&gt; Abu Jaber has also professed a belief in "Popular Jihad", a bottom-to-top approach in which jihadists would win the hearts and minds of the people, before setting out to establish jihadi governance, after receiving enough popular support, which is notably the opposite of ISIL's "elite Jihad" top-to-bottom approach.&lt;ref name="al-Qaeda's grand plan" /&gt;

Analysts have also argued that the group continues to maintain many of [[al-Nusra Front]]'s al-Qaeda ideologies.&lt;ref name="face off" /&gt; Syrian reporter [[Abdullah Suleiman Ali]] also said that many of the former Jabhat Fateh al-Sham fighters still answered to al-Qaeda, and held an increasing amount of sway over the new group, despite its public rebranding.&lt;ref name="face off"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2017/02/21/will-major-opposition-groups-face-off-syria.html|title=Will major opposition groups face off in Syria?|author=Haytham Mouzahem|date=17 February 2017|publisher=Al-Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tahrir al-Sham continues to harbor the former al-Nusra Front's goal of turning Syria into an Islamic Emirate, if such a governing entity were declared, it would be similar to ISIL's declaration of a Caliphate, according to Kremlin diplomats.&lt;ref name="worrisome" /&gt; The [[Combating Terrorism Center]] also reported that despite public statements by some of Tahrir al-Sham's top figures, the group was still largely the same al-Qaeda-aligned group it was, back when it was known as al-Nusra.&lt;ref name="formation" /&gt; Lebanese researcher [[Muhammad Alloush]] said that the goal of forming Tahrir al-Sham was to unite all groups with al-Qaeda's extreme ideology under one banner, and to obtain as many weapons as possible.&lt;ref name="face off"/&gt;

In July, 2017, according to a pro-government blog, the organization published an infographic showing some of its objectives. Among them were; "rejection of secularism and democracy", "establishment of an Islamic state", "rule by the Islamic scholars based on the sharia law" and "rejection of political rapprochement with the criminal regime (i.e. Syrian government)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://southfront.org/hayat-tahrir-al-sham-reveals-new-principles-objectives/|title=Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham Reveals Its "New" Principles And Objectives|date=13 July 2017|publisher=South Front blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2017}}

===Public opinion===
The ECHO Research Centre at [[Laurentian University]] conducted an [[opinion poll]] on 4,858 residents in several areas of Syria between 10 July 2017 and 28 July 2017. According to the poll's results, 77% of those surveyed disagreed with the Salafist ideology Tahrir al-Sham and other Salafist groups promote in Idlib, 73% rejected HTS-affiliated local councils in Idlib, 66% agreed that HTS is part of al-Qaeda in Syria, and 63% claimed that the dominance of HTS in Idlib will lead to a "second [[Battle of Tora Bora|Tora Bora]]". Of those who participated in the poll, nearly all of them (close to 100%) considered HTS to be contrary to the goals of the [[Syrian opposition]], although they were split in its extent. 51% of them considered HTS to be contrary to the opposition since its inception, 42% considered HTS to be previously consistent with the opposition, but is no longer so, and 7% considered HTS to be a [[counter-revolutionary]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all4syria.info/Archive/437312|title=A poll of the population of Idlib .. in light of the deportation of dissidents|work=All4Syria|date=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
Since October 2017, the "general commander" or emir of Tahrir al-Sham is [[Abu Mohammad al-Julani]], who is also Tahrir al-Sham's "military commander"
and the emir of [[Jabhat Fateh al-Sham]], who also led its predecessor organisation [[al-Nusra Front]], the Syrian branch of [[al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36916606|title=Syrian Nusra Front announces split from al-Qaeda|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the general commander of Tahrir al-Sham was Hashim al-Shaykh, also known as Abu Jaber, who was the leader of [[Ahrar al-Sham]] between September 2014 and September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/aleppo-rebels-united-under-former-ahrar-al-sham-commander-1930344528|title=Aleppo rebels unite under former Ahrar al-Sham commander|work=Middle East Eye|author=Alex MacDonald|date=16 February 2016|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 2017, Abu Jaber resigned from his position as the general leader of Tahrir al-Sham and was replaced by Abu Mohammad al-Julan. Abu Jaber took another position as the head of HTS's Shura council.&lt;ref name=fate/&gt;

Individuals in ''italic'' are defectors from [[Ahrar al-Sham]], which either left to join [[Jabhat Fateh al-Sham]] in the last few days of its existence, or directly joined Tahrir al-Sham.

==Political relations==
===Al Qaeda===
[[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] has opposed the split of HTS from Al Qaeda, stating that it was done without his consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1099286/tahrir-al-sham-arrests-qaeda-leaders-cranks-zawahiri-julani-dispute|title=Tahrir al-Sham Arrests of Qaeda Leaders Cranks up Zawahiri- Julani Dispute|date=30 November 2017|publisher=Asharq Al-Awsat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Al-Qaeda circles and supporters have also condemned Joulani and compared him to [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] because of the group's [[October 2016 Idlib Governorate clashes|conflicts]] with other rebel groups, and have described him as an 'opportunist' as well as making claims that he is an agent of foreign powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.siteintelgroup.com/blog/index.php/categories/jihad/entry/434-has-al-qaeda-replanted-its-flag-in-syria-1|title=Has al-Qaeda Replanted its Flag in Syria?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahrar al-Sham===
According to [[Abdul Razzaq al-Mahdi]], who was a leading scholar in Tahrir al-Sham, the groups do not particularly hate one another in the political or social battlefield. Certain members, however, do believe that a war between the two would be possible, since Ahrar al-Sham's attendance at the Astana talks labels it as a "moderate" faction, often seen as blasphemy within groups such as Tahrir al-Sham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ogn.news/tashm/|title=Is Tahreer Sham gearing up for a fight with Ahrar?|first=OGN|last=News|date=2 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018 Ahrar al-Sham and the [[Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement]] merged and formed the [[Syrian Liberation Front]] then launched an [[Idlib Governorate clashes (February 2018)|offensive]] against Tahrir al-Sham seizing several villages and the city of [[Maarrat al-Nu'man]].

'''''The Ant Bully''''' ({{ISBN|0590395912}}) is a 1999 [[children's book]] drawn and written by [[John Nickle]]. It is about a young boy named Lucas Nickle (also known as Peanut the Destroyer), who is the [[title character]] in the book and who likes to torment [[ant]]s. It was later adapted into a [[The Ant Bully (film)|computer-animated film of the same name]] by [[John A. Davis]], produced by [[Legendary Pictures]] and [[DNA Productions]] for [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].

==Story==
Lucas is a boy who is perceived as "strange" by his peers due to his funny glasses and propeller beanie (hat). Sid, the neighborhood bully, continuously bullies Lucas by spraying him with a water hose and stealing his hat. In an attempt to cope with Sid's actions, Lucas projects his anger onto a local colony of ants by spraying them with water, just as Sid has done to him.

The ants have enough and tackle and shove Lucas into the queen's chamber, and the queen confronts him about all of the trouble he has caused the colony. When Lucas is too shocked to even respond to her, the queen takes it as an insult, and orders an ant wizard to shrink the boy down to the size of an ant and take him to trial, where the judge declares him guilty. His punishment is to work hard like an ant, working in the field, gathering food, defending the colony from wasps and spiders, and taking care of the queen, the worst part of his punishment.

After a while, the queen tells Lucas that he has one last test to be set free: he must go home and bring her a Red Sweet Rock (jelly bean). Lucas brings two ants with him on the journey, and they ask him what it's like being a giant. Lucas tells them that he isn't a giant and gets picked on by Sid, who does all the same things Lucas does to the ants. When they reach his house, they find a box of swell jells, but Lucas's father sees the ants and tries to smash them with a fly swatter. Lucas shouts at his dad to stop, helping the ants to escape. Meanwhile, the queen is upset, fearing that Lucas was killed, but to her surprise he returns, and as promised she gives him the potion to return him to his right size. Lucas falls asleep and wakes up to see Sid, only to his surprise the ants got to him first and shrunk him as revenge.
