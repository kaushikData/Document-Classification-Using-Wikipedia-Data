'''Aga Khan''' ({{Lang-ar|آغا خان}}, {{Lang-fa|آقاخان}}; also  transliterated as ''Aqa Khan'' and ''Agha Khan''&lt;ref name="DaftaryIsmailis2ed"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Daftary|first1=Farhad|authorlink1=Farhad Daftary|title=The Ismāʻı̄lı̄s: their history and doctrines|year=2007|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-511-35561-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
is a title held by the [[Imamate in Nizari doctrine|Imām]] of the [[Nizari]] [[Isma'ilism|Ismāʿīli]] [[Shia Islam|Shia]]s. {{As of|1957|since=y}}, the holder of the title has been the 49th Imām, Prince [[Shah]] Karim al-Husseini, [[Aga Khan IV]] (b. 1936).

==Title==
The title is made up of the titles "[[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]" and "[[Khan (title)|khan]]". The Turkish "agha" is "aqa" (Āqā) in [[Persian language|Persian]]. The word "agha" comes from the [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]] and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] "aqa", meaning "elder brother",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/aga|title=the definition of aga|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nisanyansozluk.com/?k=a%25C4%259Fa&amp;x=0&amp;y=0|title=imla|website=www.nisanyansozluk.com|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "khan" means king, ruler in Turkic and Mongolian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of China|last=Fairbank|first=John King|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Farhad Daftary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iis.ac.uk/view_person.asp?ID=8&amp;type=auth |title=The Institute of Ismaili Studies |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512113401/http://www.iis.ac.uk/view_person.asp?ID=8&amp;type=auth |archivedate=May 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a scholar of the Ismaili movement, ''Aga Khan'' is an honorific title bestowed on [[Aga Khan I|Hasan Ali Shah]] (1800–1881), the 46th Imām of Nizari Ismailis (1817–1881), by [[Qajar dynasty|Persian king]] [[Fath-Ali Shah Qajar]].&lt;ref name="DaftaryBib"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ismaili Literature: A Bibliography Of Sources And Studies| last=[[Farhad Daftary|Daftary]]| first=[[Farhad Daftary|Farhad]]| year=2004| publisher=Institute of Ismaili Studies|isbn=978-1-850-43439-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Daftary apparently contradicts what the Aga Khan III noted in a famous legal proceeding in India: that ''Aga Khan'' is not a title but instead an [[Pseudonym|alias]] that was given to the Aga Khan I when he was a young man.&lt;ref name="haji bibi"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Russell|first1=Justice|authorlink1=Bombay High Court|title=Haji Bibi vs H.H.

==History==
{{Multiple issues|section=y|
{{Original research section|date=November 2018}}
{{Expand section|date=November 2018}}
}}
During the latter stages of the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] (1841–1842), [[Hasan Ali Shah]] and his cavalry officers provided assistance to [[William Nott (British general)|General Nott]] in [[Kandahar Province]] and to [[Richard England (general)|General England]] in his advance from [[Sindh]] to join Nott.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} For these and for other diligent efforts made by him in the service of the Empire, the [[British Raj]] recognised him as a "prince". This title was less extraordinary in that time and place than it seems today, because the British, while consolidating their hold on India, had been doling out similar titles liberally to any large landowner or tribal chieftain with local influence who made himself useful to them. 

Yet, the Agha Khan was exceptional in that, while it was local tribal influence which had enabled him to serve the British and gain their favor, his claim to nobility was based upon his claim to leadership of an entire sect of Islam. This claim was dubious at best, but imperial Britain saw great possibilities in having under their control and patronage the head of a major [[Shia]] sect; it could even be used at some later stage to counterbalance the influence of the [[Ottoman Caliph]], head of Islam as recognized by the [[Sunni]] sects. In pursuance of this grander narrative, and recognizing that his pretensions and Anglophilia were alike repugnant to the tribes then under his influence, he was awarded the status of "Prince" by the British government's representatives in India and became the only religious or community leader in [[British India]] granted a personal gun salute.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

When Hasan Ali Shah, the first Aga Khan, came to Sindh (which is now in [[Pakistan]]) from Afghanistan, he and his army were welcomed by Mir Nasir Khan of [[Baluchistan]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} In 1866, the [[Aga Khan I|Aga Khan]] won a court victory in the High Court of Bombay in what popularly became known as the [[Aga Khan Case]], securing his recognition by the [[British government]] as the head of the [[Khoja]] community. The Aga Khan is also the [[Pir (Sufism)|Pir]] within the [[Nizari]] [[Ismaili]] community.

In 1887, the [[Secretary of State for India]], acting through the [[Viceroy of India]], formally recognized the title ''Aga Khan''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Anti-Indian sentiment''' or '''Indophobia''' refers to negative feelings and hatred towards [[India]], [[Indian people|Indians]], and [[Indian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/analysis/what-does-anti-indian-mean|title=What does ‘anti-Indian’ mean?|work=sunday-guardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indophobia is formally defined in the context of anti-Indian prejudice in East Africa as "a tendency to react negatively towards people of Indian extraction against aspects of Indian culture and normative habits".&lt;!-- quoted text is non-grammatical. is it correct? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ali Mazrui]], "The De-Indianisation of Uganda: Does it require an Educational Revolution?" paper delivered to the East African Universities Social Science Council Conference, 19–23 December 1972, Nairobi, Kenya, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Its opposite is [[Indomania]].

{{toclimit|3}}

==Historic anti-India sentiment==
By the late 19th century, [[sinophobia]] had already emerged in North America over [[Chinese immigration to the United States|Chinese immigration]] and the cheap labour it supplied, mostly for railroad construction in California and elsewhere on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese railroad labourers in North America during the mid-late nineteenth century|url=http://web.mac.com/matthew.annis/iWeb/Chinese%20railroad%20labourers/Introduction_files/Introduction.pdf|work=Chinese railroad labourers in North America during the mid-late nineteenth century|publisher=Matthew Annis|accessdate=27 May 2012|author=Matthew Annis|format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] [[jargon]] common in the day, ordinary workers, newspapers and politicians opposed this "[[Yellow Peril]]". The common cause of eradicating Asians from the workforce gave rise to the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]]. As the [[Indian American|Indian community]] of mostly [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]i [[Sikh]]s settled in California, the xenophobia expanded to encompass immigrants from [[British India]].&lt;ref&gt;Chan Sucheng, Asian Americans: An Interpretive History, Twayne 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Shut the gate to the Hindoo invasion", San Francisco examiner, 6 June 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Closed Borders and Mass Deportations: The Lessons of the Barred Zone Act|url=http://www.ilaborate.org/resource/closed_borders_and_mass_deportations_the_lessons_of_the_barred_zone_act|work=Closed Borders and Mass Deportations: The Lessons of the Barred Zone Act|publisher=Immigration Policy Center|accessdate=27 May 2012|author=Alicia J. Campi|format=Scribd file|date=1 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial period===

====Indologists====
The relation of "[[Indomania]]" and "Indophobia" in colonial era British [[Indology]] was discussed by American Indologist [[Thomas Trautmann]] (1997) who found that Indomania had become a norm in early 19th century Britain as the result of a conscious agenda of [[Evangelicalism]] and [[utilitarianism]], especially by [[Charles Grant (British East India Company)|Charles Grant]] and [[James Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aryans and British India|author=Thomas R. Trautmann|year=1997 |ref=harv}} {{Google books|jR_LPnEH3GsC|Aryans and British India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians noted that during the British Empire, "evangelical influence drove British policy down a path that tended to minimize and denigrate the accomplishments of Indian civilization and to position itself as the negation of the earlier British [[Indomania]] that was nourished by belief in Indian wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Trautmann|1997|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Grant's highly influential "Observations on the ...Asiatic subjects of Great Britain" (1796),&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Charles. (1796) Observations on the state of society among the Asiatic subjects of Great Britain, particularly with respect to morals; and on the means of improving it, written chiefly in the year 1792.&lt;/ref&gt; he criticized the Orientalists for being too respectful to Indian culture and religion. His work tried to determine the Hindus' "true place in the moral scale" and he alleged that the Hindus are "a people exceedingly depraved". Grant believed that Great Britain's duty was to civilise and Christianize the natives.

[[Lord Macaulay]], serving on the [[Supreme Council of India]] between 1834 and 1838, was instrumental in creating the foundations of bilingual colonial India. He convinced the Governor-General to adopt English as the medium of instruction in higher education from the sixth year of schooling onwards, rather than [[Sanskrit]] or [[Arabic]]. He claimed: "I have never found one among them who could deny that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native [[Indian literature|literature of India]] and [[Arabic literature|Arabia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern History Sourcebook: Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800-1859): On Empire and Education|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1833macaulay-india.asp|work=Internet Modern History Sourcebook|publisher=Paul Halsall|accessdate=27 May 2012|author=Thomas Babington Macaulay|date=July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that [[Unani|Arabic]] and [[Ayurveda|Sanskrit works on medicine]] contain "medical doctrines which would disgrace an English Farrier – [[Indian astronomy|Astronomy]], which would move laughter in girls at an English boarding school – [[History of India|History]], abounding with kings thirty feet high reigns thirty thousand years long – and [[Geography of India|Geography]] made up of seas of treacle and seas of butter".&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, Thomas Babington, 1835:242-243, Minute on Indian education.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most influential historians of India during the British Empire, [[James Mill]] was criticised for prejudice against Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Trautmann|1997|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.H. Wilson|Horace Hayman Wilson]] wrote that the tendency of Mill's work was "evil".&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Wilson 1858 in James Mill 1858, The history of British India, Preface of the editor&lt;/ref&gt; Mill claimed that both Indians and [[China|Chinese]] people are cowardly, unfeeling and mendacious. Both Mill and Grant attacked Orientalist scholarship that was too respectful of Indian culture: "It was unfortunate that a mind so pure, so warm in the pursuit of truth so devoted to oriental learning, as that of Sir [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], should have adopted the hypothesis of a high state of civilization in the principal countries of Asia."&lt;ref&gt;Mill, James – 1858, 2:109, The history of British India.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dadabhai Naoroji]] spoke against such anti-India sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;"Essays, speeches, addresses and writings" by Dadabhai Naoroji&lt;/ref&gt;

====Colonialists====
[[Stereotypes of South Asians|Stereotypes of Indians]] intensified during and after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], known as [[India's First War of Independence (term)|India's First War of Independence]] to the Indians and as the Sepoy Mutiny to the British, when Indian [[sepoy]]s rebelled against the British [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]]. Allegations of [[war rape]] were used as [[propaganda]] by British [[Colonialism|colonialists]] in order to justify the colonization of India. While incidents of rape committed by Indian rebels against British women and girls were generally uncommon, this was exaggerated by the [[Media of the United Kingdom|British media]] to justify continued British intervention in the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vanishing Women: Magic, Film Feminism|first=Karen Redrobe|last=Beckman|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=0-8223-3074-1|pages=31–3| postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, [[History of British newspapers|British newspapers]] had printed various apparently eyewitness accounts of British women and girls being raped by Indian rebels, but cited little physical evidence. It was later found that some were fictions created to paint the native people as savages who needed to be civilized, a mission sometimes known as "[[The White Man's Burden]]". One such account published by ''[[The Times]]'', regarding an incident where 48 British girls as young as 10–14 had been raped by Indian rebels in [[Delhi]], was criticized as propaganda by [[Karl Marx]], who pointed out that the story was written by a clergyman in [[Bangalore]], far from the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vanishing Women: Magic, Film Feminism|first=Karen Redrobe|last=Beckman|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=0-8223-3074-1|pages=33–4| postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A wave of anti-Indian vandalism accompanied the rebellion.

===Post-independence===
Contemporary Indophobia has risen in the western world, particularly the United States, on account of the rise of the [[Indian American]] community and the increase in [[offshoring]] of [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] jobs to India by American multinational corporations.&lt;ref name="IndFact"&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~ap2231/ET/et80_July27-05.htm Indophobia: Facts versus Fiction], [[Arvind Panagariya]], [[Columbia University]] archives of ''[[The Economic Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Indophobia in the west manifests itself through intimidation and harassment, such as the case of the anti-Hindu [[Dotbusters]] street gang. Cultural theorists have shown that more genteel forms of Indophobia thrive in forums like the editorial pages of ''The New York Times'', and especially in the cliche-ridden and often factually dubious writings of its long-time South Asia reporter, [[Barbara Crossette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Juluri|first1=Vamsi|title=Indophobia: The Real Elephant in the Living Room|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/vamsee-juluri/indophobia-the-real-eleph_b_415237.html|website=Huffington Post|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
According to [[Christophe Jaffrelot]] and Jean-Luc Racine, Pakistan's nationalism is primarily anti-Indian, even though Pakistan was part of Indian civilization over many thousands of years. "This is the essence of the country's identity."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Tufts University]] professor [[Vali Nasr|Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr]], anti-India sentiment in Pakistan increased with the ascendancy of the [[Islamist]] [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] under [[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]].&lt;ref name="Vali Nasr"/&gt; It is also used to derive the legitimacy of the Pakistani state.

&lt;/ref&gt; In Pakistan, this contributed to Indophobia. In an interview with Indian news channel [[CNN-IBN]] Pakistani cricketer and politician [[Imran Khan]] said "I grew up hating India because I grew up in [[Lahore]] and there were massacres of 1947, so much bloodshed and anger.

According to [[Husain Haqqani]] after partition Pakistan faced multiple challenges to its survival. At the time Pakistan's secular leaders decided to use Islam as a rallying cry against perceived threats from predominantly Hindu India. Unsure of Pakistan's future they deliberately promoted anti-India sentiment with "Islamic Pakistan" resisting a "Hindu India".&lt;ref&gt;

====In Pakistani textbooks====

{{Main|Pakistani textbooks controversy}}
According to [[Sustainable Development Policy Institute]] since the 1970s Pakistani school textbooks have systematically inculcated hatred towards India and Hindus.&lt;ref name=sdpi&gt;
{{cite book |title=The subtle subversion: the state of curricula and textbooks in Pakistan — Urdu, English, Social Studies and Civics |author1=A. H. Nayyar |author2=Ahmed Salim |publisher=Sustainable Development Policy Institute |year=2005}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report of the project ''A Civil Society Initiative in Curricula and Textbooks Reform''. Sustainable Development Policy Institute, Islamabad.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this report, "Associated with the insistence on the Ideology of Pakistan has been an essential component of hate against India and the Hindus. For the upholders of the Ideology of Pakistan, the existence of Pakistan is defined only in relation to Hindus hence the Hindus have to be painted as negatively as possible".&lt;ref name= sdpi/&gt;
A 2005 report by the National Commission for Justice and Peace, a nonprofit organization in Pakistan, found that [[Pakistan studies]] textbooks in Pakistan have been used to articulate the hatred that Pakistani policy-makers have attempted to inculcate towards the Hindus. "Vituperative animosities legitimize military and autocratic rule, nurturing a siege mentality. Pakistan Studies textbooks are an active site to represent India as a hostile neighbor", the report stated. "The story of Pakistan's past is intentionally written to be distinct from often in direct contrast with, interpretations of history found in India. From the government-issued textbooks, students are taught that Hindus are backward and superstitious.' Further the report stated 'Textbooks reflect intentional obfuscation. Today's students, citizens of Pakistan and its future leaders are the victims of these blatant lies."&lt;ref&gt;

In 1971 rising political discontent in [[East Pakistan]], on the other side of India from West Pakistan, led to calls to secede from Pakistan, which were [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|brutally suppressed]] by [[Pakistan Army]] leading to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. India intervened, triggering the brief [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] that culminated in Pakistan's defeat and the secession of East Pakistan which then became [[Bangladesh]]. According to [[Ardeshir Cowasjee]] in [[West Pakistan]] the political and military leadership whipped up anti-India sentiment with the slogan "crush India", trying to convince the people that the only issue in East Pakistan was India supporting a [[secession]]ist movement.&lt;ref name="Dawn20111106"&gt;

Writing for [[Middle East Research and Information Project]] Pakistani nuclear scientist [[Pervez Hoodbhoy]] stated that anti-Indian sentiment is instilled in Pakistani soldiers early in their training at [[Cadet College Hasan Abdal]] and [[Cadet College Petaro]].

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
{{see also|Persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh}}

Even though India played a key role in the independence of Bangladesh, providing arms and training to the nationalists, the relationship began to sour within a few years. After the 1975 military coup, `Bangladeshi nationalism' was formulated as a new identity, which portrayed India as an adversary. Over the next 30 years, the situation worsened with the addition of further issues of difference between the two nations. There is a general perception of an Indian regional hegemony among the Bangladeshis. Such perceptions were used by the military regimes and the BNP to cultivate an atmosphere of Indophibia and exploit it for electoral gains.{{sfn|Riaz|2012|pp=63-64}}

Although a sizeable Hindu minority remained in Bangladesh following the 1947 [[Partition of India]], growing anti-Hinduism caused steady migration into India. The phobia that had grown from anti-Hinduism into Indophobia forms part of ethnic [[Bengali people|Bengali]] Nationalism,&lt;ref name="Saikia"&gt;http://www.acdis.uiuc.edu/Research/OPs/Saikia/SaikiaOP.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which continues to mark Bangladeshi perceptions of Indians.
Political disputes such as the [[Farakka Barrage]], [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves]] and [[Indo-Bangladeshi barrier]] created rifts between the two countries.&lt;ref name="rediff2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/dec/21bspec.htm |title=Why Bangladesh hates India |publisher=Rediff.com|date=31 December 2004 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persecution of Hindus]] in Bangladesh by the rising tide of militant Islamists and cross-border infiltration into India by illegal Bangladeshi immigrants created anti-Bangladeshi sentiment in India. Indophobia coupled with anti-Hinduism, led to accusations of [[dual loyalty]] among Bangladeshi [[Hindus]] by right-wing Bangladeshis often affiliated with the [[Al-Badr]]-esque [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]] and the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party|BNP]].&lt;ref name="USCIRF"&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/nov/02aziz.htm Bangladesh slammed for persecution of Hindus], Rediff.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/hrfeatures/HRF13.htm The Hindu Minority in Bangladesh: Legally Identified Enemies], Human Rights Documentation Centre&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riaz|2012|p=64}} However most of Bangladesh India problems are not based on religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=PTI |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/bangladesh-is-a-secular-country-sheikh-hasina/articleshow/47688632.cms |title=Bangladesh is a secular country: Sheikh Hasina – The Economic Times |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2015-06-16 |accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka===
Anti-Indian prejudice may be caused by the island nation's bad experience with Indian empires (such as the [[Chola Empire]]), their ethnic tensions with Sri Lanka's [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Tamil minority]], who are accused of loyalty to India,&lt;ref name="Cholan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangam.org/taraki/articles/2006/12-12_Indo-Lanka.php?uid=2113|title=Indo-Lanka Relationships|work=sangam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's support and training of the [[LTTE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Brewster |first=David |chapter=Maritime South Asia |title=India's Ocean: The Story of India's Bid for Regional Leadership |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dkYsAwAAQBAJ |date=2014 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-1-317-80698-1 |chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/7992855/Extract_from_Indias_Ocean_-_the_lead_up_to_Indias_1987_intervention_in_Sri_Lanka}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as past attacks against Sri Lankan civilians allegedly committed by Indian forces, such as the [[Jaffna hospital massacre|Jaffna Hospital]] incident.&lt;ref&gt;Somasundaram, Daya; Jamunanantha, CS (2002). de Jong, Joop, ed.&amp;nbsp;Trauma, War, and Violence: Public Mental Health in Socio-Cultural Context. Springer. p.&amp;nbsp;213.&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|978-0-30646709-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite India's alliance with the Sri Lankan government during the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], anti-Indian hatreds and prejudices are fairly common among the ethnic [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]], escalated by [[Buddhist]] Nationalism and militancy. Attitudes towards [[Tamil people|Tamil]]s are associated with Indophobia and Tamils are labeled "Indian spies". Indian traders and businessmen, patronized by the Tamil minority, have been shunned and attacked by the Sinhalese.&lt;ref name="Cholan"/&gt;

During the 1950s, discriminatory measures taken by the Sinhala regime targeted Indian traders (typically from the Indian states of [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), forcing the traders out of Sri Lanka. Following this, trade with India was deliberately scuttled, as was the sale of Indian magazines.&lt;ref name="Cholan"/&gt;

The Indophobia of that era led the Sinhala government to go after the so-called Tamils of 'recent' Indian origin. These immigrant plantation workers were imported by the British more than a hundred years earlier and had already been stripped of citizenship by earlier legislation&amp;mdash;the first Legislative Act of the newly independent country in 1948. Since then, these Tamils lived as 'stateless' persons and many returned to India.&lt;ref name="Cholan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/gandhi-statue-vandalised-in-sri-lanka-the-hindu/ |title=Gandhi Statue Vandalised In Sri Lanka – THE HINDU |publisher=Colombo Telegraph |date=7 April 2012 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, riots were carried out by Sinhalese mobs against predominantly Indian Tamils in Ratnapura, Kahawatte and Balangoda areas. Shops were looted and set on fire and many women and girls were raped by marauding mobs.{{CN|date=October 2018}} During the [[Black July]] riots, 4,000 Indian and Sri Lankan Tamils were killed by Sinhalese rioters.{{CN|date=October 2018}}

===Myanmar (Burma)===
Anti-Indian sentiments began to rise in [[Burma]] after the First World War ended&lt;ref&gt;"The Muslims of Burma", p.32&lt;/ref&gt; due to a number of reasons. The population of ethnic Indians was growing rapidly in Myanmar (almost half of Yangon's population was Indian by the [[World War II|Second World War]]&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Modern Asia"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/yangon-ema-06/ | title =Encyclopedia of Modern Asia| publisher =''Charles Scribner's Sons'' | date= November 2002 | accessdate =2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The Indians played a prominent role in the British administration and became the target of Burmese nationalists. Racial animosity toward Indians because of their skin-color and appearance also played a role.&lt;ref name="sy"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shway Yoe (Sir [[James George Scott]]) 1882|title=The Burman – His Life and Notions|publisher=The Norton Library 1963|location=New York|pages=436, 249–251, 348, 450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the price of rice plummeted during the economic depression of the 1930s and the [[Chettiar]] from South India, who were prominent moneylenders in the rice belt, began to foreclose on land held by native Burmese.&lt;ref name="sy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ms"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Smith|year=1991|title=Burma – Insurgency and the Politics of Ethnicity|publisher=Zed Books|location=London, New Jersey|pages=43–44,98,56–57,176|isbn = 984-05-1499-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1930, a British firm of [[stevedore]]s at the port of Rangoon employed Burmese workers in an attempt to break a strike organized by its Indian workers. When, on 26 May, the strike ended and the Indians returned to work, clashes soon developed between the returning Indian workers and the Burmese workers who had replaced them. The clashes soon escalated into large-scale anti-Indian riots in the city. Over two hundred Indians were killed and their dead bodies flung into the river. Authorities ordered the police to fire upon any assembly of five or more who refused to lay down their arms, under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Within two days the riot spread throughout the country to locations such as [[Pyin U Lwin|Maymyo]].&lt;ref name="Maurice Collis, Trials in Burma"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Collis|first=Maurice|publisher=Penguin Books|title=Trials in Burma|place=London|year=1945|isbn=0-404-54812-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Burma achieved Independence, Burmese law treated a large percentage of the Indian community as "resident aliens". Though many had long ties to Burma or were born there, they were not considered citizens under the 1982 Burma citizenship law which restricted citizenship for groups immigrating before 1823.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burma Citizenship Law|publisher=United Nations Human Rights Commission|date=15 October 1982|accessdate=9 October 2009|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?docid=3ae6b4f71b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seizing power through a military coup in 1962, General [[Ne Win]] ordered a large-scale expulsion of Indians. Although many Indians had been living in Burma for generations and had integrated into Burmese society, they became a target for discrimination and oppression by the junta. This, along with a wholesale nationalization of private ventures in 1964, led to the emigration of over 300,000 ethnic Indians from Burma.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; Indian-owned businesses were nationalized and their owners were given 175 kyat for their trip to India. This caused a significant deterioration in Indian-Burmese relations and the Indian government arranged ferries and aircraft to lift Burmese of Indian ethnicity out of [[Burma]].&lt;ref name="irrawaddy-1999"&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 1999 | title=India and Burma: working on their relationship | url=http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=1170|journal= |publisher= The Irrawaddy |volume=7 |issue=3 |accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
Discrimination of Indians exists in Malaysia. On 28 June 1969, rioting broke out in [[Sentul, Kuala Lumpur|Sentul]] where [[Malaysian Malay|Malay]]s attacked Indians, and 15 Indians were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Slimming |title=The Death of a Democracy |publisher= John Murray Publishers Ltd |year= 1969 |isbn=978-0719520457 |pages=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2001, a 9-day communial violence known as the [[2001 Kampung Medan riots]] occurred between Indians and Malays cost the deaths of 6 people and injuring many more people. The severity of injuries range from head injuries to severed limbs. The riots no doubt caused anti-Indian feelings among Malays residing in [[Selangor]] and [[Klang Valley]].

The novel [[Interlok]] caused ernomous controversial backclash for allegedly being anti-Indian as the book includes racist derogatory terms used to refer to Indians such as "Pariah" and "black people". The novel also includes the usage of the term ''kasta pariah'' ("[[Outcast (person)|pariah]] caste"), which often refers to persons from the lowest caste in the [[Indian caste system]].&lt;ref name=thestar&gt;{{Cite news|title=Unlocking the ‘Interlok’ issue|work=The Star|date=9 January 2011|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/1/9/focus/7763036&amp;sec=focus|accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==

===South Africa===
The first anti-Indian commotion that took place in [[South Africa]] was the [[Durban riots]] in 1949 that took place in the South Africa's largest city [[Durban]], where angry Black [[Zulus]] attacked and killed 142 ethnic Indians, destroyed and looted Indian property, and also accounts of Indian women being raped.&lt;ref name="SAhistory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/70-durban-riots-1949 | title=The Durban riots, 1949 | publisher=South African History Online | accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many local [[Whites]] who were present openly supported the Zulus in their anti-Indian killings and even participated in the lootings.

Another anti-Indian riot took place again in Durban in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theindianstar.com/index.php?uan=5786 Current Africa race riots like 1949 anti-Indian riots: minister], TheIndianStar.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous peace activist [[Mahatma Gandhi]] experienced anti-Indian racism when he was in South Africa, he was beaten up by a driver for travelling in first class coach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth/Part_II/More_Hardships]&lt;/ref&gt;
Indians were also not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa and Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth/Part_II/What_it_is_to_be_a_%27Coolie%27]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uganda===
The most prominent case is the [[ethnic cleansing]] of Indians and other [[South Asian]]s (sometimes simply called "[[Asian people|Asian]]") in [[Uganda]] by [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"&gt;General Amin and the Indian Exodus from Uganda
Hasu H. Patel, Issue: A Journal of Opinion, Vol. 2, No. 4 (Winter, 1972), pp. 12-22 {{doi|10.2307/1166488}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda]].)

According to H.H. Patel, many [[Indian diaspora in East Africa|Indians in East Africa]] and [[Uganda]] were [[tailors]] and [[bankers]], leading to [[stereotyping]].

Indophobia in Uganda existed under [[Milton Obote]], before Amin's rise. The 1968 Committee on "Africanisation in Commerce and Industry" in Uganda made far-reaching Indophobic proposals.{{vague|date=April 2012}}

A system of work permits and trade licenses was introduced in 1969 to Indians' [[economic]] and professional activities. Indians were [[Racial segregation|segregated]] and [[discriminated]] against in all walks of life. After Amin came to power, he exploited these divisions to spread [[propaganda]] against Indians.

Indians were stereotyped as "only traders" and thereby "[[inbred]]" to their profession. Indians were attacked as "dukawallas" (an occupational term that degenerated into an anti-Indian slur during Amin's time). They were stereotyped as "greedy, conniving", without racial identity or loyalty but "always cheating, conspiring and plotting" to subvert Uganda.

Amin used this to justify a campaign of "de-Indianisation", eventually resulting in the [[Expulsion of Asians in Uganda in 1972|expulsion]] and [[ethnic cleansing]] of Uganda's Indian minority.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"/&gt; Some 80,000 were expelled, leading about 25,000 to settle in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;About 10,000 Indian citizens plus some 5,000 British passport holders went to India. Canada took most of Uganda citizens (about 40,000) and the rest were taken by other countries, e.g. the US, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, etc.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/england/suffolk/article_1.shtml Uganda's loss, Britain's gain -BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
===United Kingdom===
The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] triggered mass anti-Indian hysteria amongst the British public as news of atrocities committed by Indian rebels against British civilians became increasingly widely known throughout [[United Kingdom|Britain]], resulting in the mass slaughter of Indian civilians by British forces during the revolt. In Oudh alone, 150,000 Indians were massacred by British troops, with 100,000 of them being civilians.&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Comprehensive History of India|author=Chopra, P.N.|date=2003|volume=3|publisher=Sterling Publishers|isbn=9788120725065|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RAON5AW4yUEC&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage|page=118|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Places such as Delhi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Lucknow were all met with general massacre after they were recaptured by British forces.&lt;ref name="google4"/&gt; One young officer was apparently recorded as saying "the orders were to shoot every soul... it was literally murder."

The UK's prime minister Sir [[Winston Churchill]] also expressed his hatred and disgust of Indians frequently throughout his career. During the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] when Churchill was confronted by some British officials to direct food supplies to save starving Indians, in a calm reply Churchill suggested that it was the result and fault of the Indians for "breeding like rabbits" and joked that the famine was merrily culling the Indian population.&lt;ref name=Church&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/not-his-finest-hour-the-dark-side-of-winston-churchill-2118317.html | title= Not his finest hour: The dark side of Winston Churchill| date=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration from India to the United States became more frequent between 1907-1920 because of Canada's Immigration Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feetham|first=R.|date=1921|title=The New Government of India act|jstor=753056|journal=Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law|volume=3|issue=1|pages=101–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1910 which restricted the number of Indians coming into the country.

[[Vamsee Juluri]], author and Professor of [[Media Studies]] at the [[University of San Francisco]], identifies Indophobia in certain sections of the [[United States|US]] media as part of a racist [[postcolonial]]/[[neo-colonialism|neocolonial]] discourse used to attack and defame India and encourage racial prejudice against [[Indian Americans]], particularly in light of India's recent economic progress, which some "old-school" colonialists find to be incompatible with their [[The Clash of Civilizations|Clash of Civilization]]s world view. Juluri identified numerous instances of bias and prejudice against Indians in US media, such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Foreign Policy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/vamsee-juluri/indophobia-the-real-eleph_b_415237.html | work=Huffington Post |first=Vamsee | last=Juluri | title=Indophobia: The Real Elephant in the Living Room | date=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempts to erase and disparage the history of India in American school textbooks misrepresent the history of India during the [[California textbook controversy over Hindu history]] with the final verdict to retain the term "India" in Californian textbooks and to remove the disparaging, disrespectful contents in the textbooks.

==Oceania==

===Australia===
In May and June 2009, [[2009 attacks on Indian students in Australia|racially motivated attacks against Indian international students]] and a perceived poor police response sparked protests. Rallies were held in both Melbourne and Sydney. Impromptu street protests were held in Harris Park, a suburb of western Sydney with a large Indian population. Representatives of the Indian government met with the Australian government to express concern and request that Indians be protected. Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] expressed regret and called for the attackers to be brought to justice. The United Nations termed these attacks "disturbing" and the human rights commissioner [[Navi Pillay]], herself a member of the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]], asked Australia to investigate the matters further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_un-asks-australia-to-investigate-root-cause-of-attacks-on-indian_1355539|title=UN asks Australia to investigate 'root cause' of attacks on Indian|work=Daily News and Analysis|date=5 March 2010 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the 2008 edition of the [[peer-reviewed]] ''[[Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television]]'', [[Alasdair Pinkerton]] analysed BBC Indian coverage from independence through 2008. Pinkerton suggested a tumultuous history involving allegations of Indophobic bias, particularly during the [[cold war]], and concludes that BBC coverage of [[South Asian]] geopolitics and economics shows pervasive Indophobic bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In the journal of the [[Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses]], media analyst [[Ajai K. Rai]] strongly criticised the BBC for Indophobic bias. He found a lack of depth and fairness in BBC reporting on conflict zones in South Asia and that the BBC had, on at least one occasion, fabricated photographs while reporting on the [[Kashmir conflict]] to make India look bad. He claimed that the network made false allegations that the [[Indian Army]] stormed a sacred [[Muslim]] shrine, the tomb of [[Sheikh Noor-ud-din Wali|Hazrat Sheikh Noor-u-din Noorani]] in [[Charari Sharief]], and only retracted the claim after strong criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

English journalist [[Christopher Booker]] has also criticized the BBC for its coverage of India-related matters. He concludes that the BBC's efforts to reinforce [[Stereotypes of South Asians]] has been directly responsible for damaging the image of India, and encouraging racist incidents against Indians, such as the [[Leipzig University internship controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Booker|first1=Christopher|title=Why to blacken India on rape do they have to omit the facts?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/11472416/Why-to-blacken-India-on-rape-do-they-have-to-omit-the-facts.html|accessdate=26 April 2018|agency=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=14 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 ''[[Forbes]]'' article, Prof. Ganguly faults the New York Times editorial board for its "hectoring" and "patronizing" tone towards India.

In September 2014, the [[Indian Space Research Organisation|Indian Space Research Organization]] (ISRO) successfully placed a spacecraft into orbit around the planet [[Mars]], thereby completing the [[Mars Orbiter Mission]].

[[Image:Karmapa5.jpg|right|260px|thumb|[[Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama|Deshin Shekpa]], wearing the Black Crown]]
The '''Black Crown''' ({{bo-tw|t=ཞྭ་ནག་|w=zhwa nag}}) is an important symbol of the [[Karmapa]], the [[Lama]] that heads the [[Karma Kagyu]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. The crown  signifies his power to benefit all sentient beings. A corresponding [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], the [[Red Crown (Buddhism)|Red Crown]], is worn by the [[Shamarpa]].  The [[Tai Situpa]] wears a red crown as well, whereas [[Goshir Gyaltsab]] wears an orange crown. 

Legend tells that in  a previous eon, in a former life as an accomplished [[yogi]], the Karmapa attained the eighth level or ''[[Bhumi (Buddhism)|bhumi]]'' of the [[bodhisattva]]s. At this time, 100,000 [[dakini]]s (female buddhas) manifested their hair as a crown, and offered it to the Karmapa as a symbol of his accomplishment. 

[[Dusum Khyenpa]], the 1st Karmapa, was regarded as an emanation of that yogi and his appearance was predicted by the historical [[Buddha Shakyamuni]] in the [[Samadhiraja Sutra]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A bodhisattva with the lion's roar will appear. He will use the power he achieved in deep meditation to benefit countless beings. By seeing, hearing, touching or thinking of him, they will be led to happiness&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Origin ==
The Karmapas were traditionally the teachers of the successive [[Ming dynasty]] [[Emperor of China|Emperors of China]]. When the 5th Karmapa, [[Dezhin Shegpa]], met the [[Yongle Emperor]], the Emperor, through his devotion and spiritual realization, was able to perceive Karmapa in the [[Sambhogakaya]] form of [[Vajradhara]] (Tib. ''Dorje Chang''), wearing a black crown on his head. The Karmapa explained to the Emperor that he could see the '[[Vajra]] Crown', the power-field of wisdom-energy that always stays above the Karmapa's head. The emperor offered to have a physical replica made so that others could receive its blessing.

A crown encrusted with precious stones and topped by a huge [[ruby]] was commissioned, and using this, the 5th Karmapa started the tradition of the Black Crown Ceremony which was performed by successive Karmapa incarnations up to the time of the 16th Karmapa, [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje]].

==Ceremony==
In preparation for the ceremony the Karmapa meditates to become inseparable with [[Chenrezig]], the Buddha of Compassion. A [[mandala]] offering is made, followed by the seven branch prayer. This is to accumulate good impressions for the ceremony that ensues. The Karmapa then places the crown on his head while reciting the [[mantra]] '[[Om Mani Padme Hum|Om Mani Peme Hung]]', transmitting blessings to each participant in the ceremony to the extent that they are capable of receiving them. It is said that by merely seeing of the Black Crown during the ceremony, one will become the first bhumi bodhisattva within three lifespans. This is one of the key reasons why the Black Crown is so important to the Karma Kagyu lineage.

==Recent developments==
In the early 1960s, the 16th Karmapa brought the Black Crown and other valuable relics of the [[Kagyu]] lineage to [[Rumtek]] monastery in [[Sikkim]]. They remained there in safekeeping until 1993 following the 16th Karmapa’s death. The ensuing [[Karmapa controversy|split in his lineage]] caused a  conflict at the monastery between supporters of the two rival claimants for the title of Karmapa. Since that time, it is said  that many valuable items have disappeared from the cloister. On July 5, 2004, the Indian Supreme Court delivered a final judgement to grant [[Rumtek]] monastery to the Karmapa Charitable Trust, principal supporters of [[Thaye Dorje]], one of the rival candidates for the title of 17th Karmapa. Since then an inventory of valuables is being prepared.  The location and integrity of the Black Crown is currently unknown.

'''Buddhism''' is a small religion in '''[[Belgium]]''' but despite lack of official recognition by the Belgian government has grown rapidly in recent years. As of the 1997 estimate, 29,497 Belgian people identified their religion as [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] (about 0.29% of the total population)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/country/?CountryID=107 Religious Intelligence - Country Profile: Belgium] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106184359/http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/country/?CountryID=107 |date=January 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buddhism in Belgium before official recognition==
Belgium has been comparatively slow in the absorption of Buddhism compared with other countries in Europe because there were no Buddhist countries amongst the territories colonized by Belgium. [[Alexandra David-Néel]] introduced the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] to the Congress of Free Thinkers in [[Brussels]] as early as 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Brosse (1991) ''Alexandra David-Neel'' (Albin Michel)&lt;/ref&gt; There was reportedly a group of those interested in Buddhism who met in Brussels in the period between the Wars.&lt;ref&gt;A. Peel Shitoku ''Vroege geschiedenis van het Boeddhisme in België'' (A Brief History of Buddhism in Belgium) EKO no.s 74 (September 1997), 75 (December 1997) &amp; 76 (March 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism had already come to the attention of Belgians academically through the works and translations of the two famous Indologists [[Louis de La Vallée Poussin]] at the [[Ghent University]] and his disciple [[Étienne Lamotte]] at the [[Université catholique de Louvain|Catholic University of Louvain]], founders of what is internationally known as the Belgian School of [[Buddhist studies]], still now active in Ghent (with the Ghent Centre for Buddhist Studies of the UGent) and Louvain-la-Neuve (at the Institut orientaliste de l'[[Université catholique de Louvain]]). There was also for a while in Brussels an Institut Belge des Hautes Etudes Bouddhiques where several Belgian scholars (Jean Dantinne, José Van den Broeck, Charles Willemen) published translations of Buddhist texts between 1969 and 1980.

Belgium has remained wary of new religions (even though in many cases they are historically much older than Christianity) and the general attitude has been illustrated by the Government publication of a blacklist of 189 organizations (including two Buddhist ones) in its ‘witchhunt’ for sects of 1997 and in the ongoing attitudes especially in the French-speaking community of Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;‘Gourou - gare à toi’ ''Lesoir'' 6/3/99&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in 1999 there were about thirty active Buddhist organizations and centres in Belgium, representing all traditions of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Phra Nicholas Thanissaro (1999) ''Lezing: Religies in Ieper - Buddhism'' Lakenhalle, Ieper 18-10-1999&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Buddhist Union of Belgium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhism.be/ Buddhist Union of Belgium - Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 1997 bringing together the various centres of Buddhism in Belgium that had been established through charitable and private organizations. The 2001 census estimated that there were 10,000 Buddhists of Belgian nationality - however, the numbers of Buddhists in the immigrant population alone exceeded 20,000.

==Hope for Buddhism attaining official recognition in Belgium==
The government was first approached on 10 June 2005 to grant official recognition for Buddhism &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71371.htm Belgium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; - a process which is expected to be completed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;"België gaat plat op zijn buik voor China (Belgium bends over backwards for China)", Metro (Belgian newspaper), 2007-05-10, pp. page 2. Retrieved on 2007-05-10. (Dutch) "[Upon the Dalai Lama for the second time in two years canceling a visit to Belgium after being informed by the Belgian government of Peking's diplomatic pressure, quote newspaper:] Uittredend Senaatsvoorzitster Anne-Marie Lizin reageert teleurgesteld: 'Gezien het belang van de vergadering waaraan u wilde deelnemen en gezien de redenen van uw beslissing, betreur ik dat ik u niet kan ontvangen in ons land, een land dat openstaat voor iedereen, ongeacht de religieuze overtuiging, en dat net een eerste stap heeft gezet in de erkenning van het'[sic] 'boeddhistische filosofie'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7031">The '''Caneyville Christian Community''' is an [[Anabaptist]] community, located in [[Caneyville, Kentucky]], living a [[Plain people|plain]] conservative lifestyle, true to the vision of former [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] bishop [[Elmo Stoll]]. [[G. C. Waldrep]] classifies them as "[[para-Amish]]". Among Anabaptists the community is often simply called "Caneyville".

== History ==

In 1990 the [[Christian Communities (Elmo Stoll)|"Christian Communities"]] were founded in [[Cookeville, Tennessee]] by [[Elmo Stoll]], a former bishop of the Old Order Amish in [[Aylmer, Ontario]]. Stoll's aim was to create a church mostly modeled on the Amish, but with community of goods and without the [[German language]] and other obstacles in order to help Christian [[Seeker (Anabaptism)|seekers]] from a non-plain background to integrate into a very plain, low technology Christian life without materialism.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. C. Waldrep]] :"The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition." in Mennonite Quarterly Review 3 (2008), page 417.&lt;/ref&gt; He was successful in establishing a community, but without community of goods, and soon many people from [[Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonite]] and [[German Baptist Brethren]] backgrounds, but also - as intended - [[Seeker (Anabaptism)|seekers]]&lt;ref&gt;The term "seeker" was (and still is) used among conservative Anabaptists to define those who were "seeking" for a different church, often a more conservative one, and often by people from a non-Anabaptist background.&lt;/ref&gt; joined his community. In addition, the "Christian Communities" soon spread to other locations in the United States and Canada. Elmo Stoll was the charismatic leader of the communities who held them together.&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Waldrep: ''The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition'', in [[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]] 82 (2008), page 417-419.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After Elmo Stoll's early death in 1998 disunion started among the "Christian Communities". Bryce Geiser, who has a [[German Baptist Brethren|German Baptist]] background, replaced Elmo Stoll as the leader of the "Christian Communities", but he could not hold together all the different people from different backgrounds. In 2001 the five congregations of the "Christian Communities" announced that they would disband the Cookeville community and the movement as a whole. That lead in the end to the disbanding of two of the five "Christian Communities", while two others joined the [[Noah Hoover Mennonite]]s and one affiliated with an Amish group from [[Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Waldrep: ''The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition'', in [[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]] 82 (2008), page 420.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Bryce Geiser, Andrew Hess and Aaron Stoll, a son of Elmo Stoll started anew and founded the Christian at [[Caneyville, Kentucky]] in order not to give up Elmo Stoll's vision.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Donnermeyer|Donnermeyer, Joseph]], and Cory Anderson: "The Growth of Amish and Plain Anabaptists in Kentucky." in Journal of Amish and Plain Anabaptist Studies 2(2):215, page 231, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Customs and belief ==

Caneyville is an [[Old Order Movement|Old Order]] community, that means, they use [[horse and buggy|horses and buggies]] instead of cars, [[Plain dress|dress Plain]] and do not use electricity, computers, cell phones and other modern conveniences. [[Internal combustion engine]]s are also not used, but [[steam engine]]s instead. They use wood stoves, the community makes, and many things are propane powered, like it is custom among many [[Amish]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://malachut.blogspot.com/2014/12/minutes-my-time-amongst-amish.html ''Minutes-My time amongst the Amish'' at malachut.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The community makes a living mainly from [[market gardening|market gardens]] and the manufacture of [[Wood-burning stove|wood stoves]]. They still adhere to Elmo Stoll's vision.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Donnermeyer|Donnermeyer, Joseph]], and Cory Anderson: "The Growth of Amish and Plain Anabaptists in Kentucky." in Journal of Amish and Plain Anabaptist Studies 2(2):215, page 231, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[G.C. Waldrep|George Calvin Waldrep]]: ''The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition'', in [[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]] 82 (2008), page 420.&lt;/ref&gt;

Donnermeyer and Anderson describe the Community as follows:

{{Cquote|The group's temperament is intentionalist, non-traditional, and inventive, yet all within a rationalized discourse supporting their ritual procedures, doctrinal expositions, and strict technological, dress, and home décor standards.&lt;ref&gt;Donnermeyer, Joseph, and Cory Anderson: "The Growth of Amish and Plain Anabaptists in Kentucky." in Journal of Amish and Plain Anabaptist Studies 2(2):215, page 231-32, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Population and communities ==

There are about 15 families at the Caneyville Christian Community, living on a {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} property. The members do not all have an Old Order background, but come from [[Amish]], [[German Baptist Brethren]], and "seeker" backgrounds. Caneyville established a daughter community near [[Brownsville, Kentucky]], some {{convert|30|mi|km}} away.&lt;ref&gt;Donnermeyer, Joseph, and Cory Anderson: "The Growth of Amish and Plain Anabaptists in Kentucky." in Journal of Amish and Plain Anabaptist Studies 2(2):215, page 231, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing ==

A bi-monthly pamphlet, called "Plain Things", is published by the Caneyville Christian Community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scrollpublishing.com/store/plain-things.html Plain Things at scrollpublishing.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Criminal Macabre: A Cal McDonald Mystery''''' is a [[comic book]] series starring Cal McDonald, an [[antihero]] American comic book character created in [[1990 in comics|1990]] by writer [[Steve Niles]]. The character's adventures have been published by [[Dark Horse Comics]] and later [[IDW Publishing]].

Cal himself is akin to [[John Constantine]], a [[DC Comics]] [[occult detective|paranormal detective]]. He takes illicit drugs, and befriends a network of ghouls to assist him in his cases. Policemen do not really care to be involved with Cal.

==Publishing history==

Cal McDonald's first story, entitled "Big-Head", was released in 1990 as part of the [[comics anthology|anthology comic]] ''Fly in My Eye: Daughters of Fly In My Eye'' from Arcane Comix, with art by [[Jim Whiting]]. That story led directly to the four-part "Hairball", serialized in ''[[Dark Horse Presents]]'' #102-105 in [[1996 in comics|1996]]. Hairball was later printed as a [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot comic]].

Cal's subsequent appearances were in two 2002 novels, ''Savage Membrane'', and ''Guns, Drugs and Monsters''. In the latter, Cal relocated to Los Angeles, after following a living, severed head searching for its body.

Following the novels, Cal made his return to comic book form in the [[Dark Horse Comics]] [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]], ''Criminal Macabre'' (2003) with [[Ben Templesmith]] as artist. The two would pair up again for a one-shot comic titled "Love Me Tenderloin" in 2004. Cal's adventures have continued in other mini-series such as "Last Train to Deadsville" and "Supernatural Freak Machine", both with artist [[Kelley Jones]], where he re-encountered the severed head. Next, he starred in the mini-series "Two Red Eyes" with artist [[Kyle Hotz]], where he does battle with the vampire [[Nosferatu]]. He also made a brief appearance in short story format in the Dark Horse Comics released title ''Drawing on your Nightmares'', again with Ben Templesmith as artist. From there, he went on to do "My Demon Baby" and "Cell Block 666" with artist [[Nick Stakal]]. The series "Two Red Eyes" started a trend continuing in "My Demon Baby", where action film actor [[Thomas Jane]] would portray Cal on the issue's covers, stylized by artist [[Tim Bradstreet]].

During the release of some of the comic book series there was another novel released in [[2003 in literature|2003]] titled ''Dial M for Monster: A Cal McDonald Collection''. This novel included several short stories featuring Cal.

''Criminal Macabre: The Complete Cal McDonald Stories'' collects the entire catalogue of Cal McDonald short stories ('''not''' the comic stories) until this point. It was released on December 26 of [[2007 in literature|2007]].

===Film===
A Cal McDonald film is said to be on the way, however due to the nature of the character, [[Steve Niles]] does not want to compromise or "water down" Cal McDonald, making it tough to find a studio that will finance the film as is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17808&amp;sectionId=2|title=Steve Niles Interview|publisher=Ugo.com|date=2010-10-07|accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5917">{{Hatnote|This article discusses the original meaning of the word "''cult''", not the term in the [[sociology of religion]], [[new religious movement]]s called "[[cult]]s", [[cult of personality|cults of personality]], or popular [[cult following]]s.}} 
{{other|Cult (disambiguation)}}

'''Cult''' is literally the "care" (Latin ''[[wikt:cultus|cultus]]'') owed to deities and to temples, shrines, or churches.  Cult is embodied in [[ritual]] and [[ceremony]]. Its present or former presence is made concrete in [[temple]]s, [[shrine]]s and [[Church (building)|churches]], and [[cult image]]s, including cult images and [[votive offering]]s at [[votive site]]s.

In the specific context of the [[Greek hero cult]], Carla Antonaccio wrote,
{{quote|The term ''cult'' identifies a pattern of ritual behavior in connection with specific objects, within a framework of spatial and temporal coordinates. ''Rituals'' would include (but not necessarily be limited to) prayer, sacrifice, votive offerings, competitions, processions and construction of monuments. Some degree of recurrence in place and repetition over time of ritual action is necessary for a cult to be enacted, to be practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Antonaccio, "Contesting the Past: Hero Cult, Tomb Cult, and Epic in Early Greece", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''98'''.3 (July 1994: 389-410) p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Etymology==
[[Cicero]] defined ''[[religio]]'' as ''cultus deorum'', "the cultivation of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' 2.8 and 1.117.&lt;/ref&gt; The "cultivation" necessary to maintain a specific deity was that god's ''cultus,'' "cult," and required "the knowledge of giving the gods their due" ''(scientia colendorum deorum)''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Ando]], ''The Matter of the Gods'' (University of California Press, 2009), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The noun ''cultus'' originates from the [[participle|past participle]] of the verb ''colo, colere, colui, cultus'', "to tend, take care of, cultivate," originally meaning "to dwell in, inhabit" and thus "to tend, cultivate [[#ager|land ''(ager)'']]; to practice agriculture," an activity fundamental to Roman identity even when Rome as a political center had become fully urbanized. ''Cultus'' is often translated as "cult" without the negative connotations the word may have in English, or with the [[Old English]] word "[[worship]]", but it implies the necessity of active maintenance beyond passive adoration. ''Cultus'' was expected to matter to the gods as a demonstration of respect, honor, and reverence; it was an aspect of the contractual nature of Roman religion (see ''[[do ut des]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Ando, ''The Matter of the Gods,'' pp. 5–7; Valerie M. Warrior, ''Roman Religion'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 6; James B. Rives, ''Religion in the Roman Empire'' (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 13, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo]] echoes Cicero's formulation when he declares, "''religio'' is nothing other than the ''cultus'' of [[God in Christianity|God]]."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 10.1; Ando, ''The Matter of the Gods,'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "cult" first appeared in [[English language|English]] in 1617, derived from the French ''culte'', meaning "[[worship]]" which in turn originated from the [[Latin]] word ''cultus'' meaning "care, cultivation, worship". The meaning "devotion to a person or thing" is from 1829. Starting about 1920, "cult" acquired an additional six or more positive and negative definitions. In French, for example, sections in newspapers giving the schedule of worship for [[Catholic Church|Catholic services]] are headed ''Culte Catholique'', while the section giving the schedule of Protestant services is headed ''culte réformé''. Within the Catholic church the most promenant Cults are those of the [[Cult of Saints|saints]].

==In Christianity==
In the [[Catholic Church]], outward religious practice in ''cultus'' is the technical term for [[Roman Catholic devotions]] or [[veneration]] extended to a particular [[saint]], not to the worship of God. Catholicism and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] make a major distinction between ''[[latria]]'', the worship that is offered to God alone, and ''[[wikt:dulia|dulia]]'', which is veneration offered to the saints, including the [[Veneration of Mary in Roman Catholicism|veneration of Mary]], whose veneration is often referred to as ''[[hyperdulia]]''.

==Outwards religious practice==
Outward religious practice in worship are [[ritual]]s, [[Ceremony|ceremonies]], [[liturgy]] or audits, which may involve spoken or sung words, and often involve personal [[sacrifice]]. Other outward manifestations of the cult of a deity are the preservation of [[relic]]s or the creation of images, such as [[icon]]s (usually connoting a flat painted image) or three-dimensional [[cult image|cultic image]]s, denigrated as "[[Cult image|idol]]s", and the specification of sacred places, hilltops and mountains, fissures and caves, springs, pools and groves, or even individual trees or stones, which may be the seat of an [[oracle]] or the venerated site of a [[Vision (religion)|vision]], [[Vision (spirituality)|apparition]], [[miracle]] or other occurrence commemorated or recreated in outward religious practice. [[Sacred]] places may be identified and elaborated by construction of [[shrine]]s, [[temple]]s, and [[Church (building)|churches]], on which are centered public attention at [[religious festival]]s and which may become the center for [[pilgrimage]]s.

The '''Democratic Peasants' Party''' ({{Lang-ro|Partidul Țărănesc Democrat}}, PȚD; {{Lang-de|Demokratische Bauernpartei}}), also known as '''Democratic Party''', '''Peasants' Party''', '''National Democratic Party''' or '''Unirea Society''', was a provincial party in [[Bukovina]], [[Austria-Hungary]], one of several groups claiming to represent the [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]]. It had a [[national liberal]] and [[left-wing populist]] agenda, and was mainly supported by "the peasants, the village teachers, and some of the intellectuals."&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; Its leader was [[Aurel Onciul]], seconded by [[Florea Lupu]], both of whom were adversaries of the conservative and elitist [[Romanian National People's Party]] (PNPR). Rejecting sectarianism, the PȚD combined [[Austrian nationalism|Austrian]] and [[Romanian nationalism]], as Onciul argued that Romanian aspirations could only be fulfilled inside the multi-ethnic empire. For this reason, and for its role in dividing the Romanian vote, the party was often accused of double-dealing.

In 1902–1905, the PȚD pursued an alliance policy with politicians from the other ethnic groups—including, most controversially, [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalists]]. This resulted in the creation of a [[Progressive Peasants' Fellowship]], which dominated the [[Diet of Bukovina]] and, in 1904, passed an electoral reform project drafted by [[Benno Straucher]]. Ethnic rivalries pushed the group back into sectarian politics before the [[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1907|legislative elections of 1907]]. The PȚD embraced [[economic antisemitism]] and, together with the PNPR, merged into [[Christian Social Romanian Party of Bukovina|Christian Social Romanian Party]] in 1908. It continued to have an autonomous existence, with its elite controlling Bukovina's state bank and [[Raiffeisen Bankengruppe (Austria)|Raiffeisen credit union]]. Its business practices nearly drove Bukovina's economy into insolvency, turning other Romanians against Onciul.

The PȚD reemerged informally during the [[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1911|election of July 1911]], and again formally in April 1914. At that stage, it embraced [[agrarianism]] and [[anticlericalism]], while also reaffirming its loyalty to Austria and its opposition to the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. It became dormant a few months later, with the outbreak of World War I and the [[Russian occupation of Eastern Galicia, 1914–15|Russian offensive]], during which party activists put up an inefficient paramilitary resistance. Onciul continued to represent the PȚD in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Austrian House of Deputies]] to 1918, singular among his Romanian colleagues for endorsing a Romanian–Ukrainian partition of Bukovina. His cooperation with the [[Ukrainian Galician Army]] resulted in his and his party's disgrace, but the backlash contributed to Bukovina's incorporation with [[Greater Romania]].

==History==
===Foundations===
The PȚD existed during the final stages of [[Duchy of Bukovina|Austrian Bukovina]], when the "extreme ethnic fragmentation"&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; created various rivalries or alliances between its main ethnic groups: the large and rural communities of Romanians and [[Ukrainians]] (or "[[Ruthenians]]"), and the mostly urban [[Bukovina Germans|German]] and [[Bukovina Jews|Jewish]] minorities. From his early years, Onciul was separated from the mainline currents of Romanian nationalism in Bukovina, represented at first by the local Concordia Society (or "National Romanian Party"). Although he did preserve contacts with its conservative wing, he was more interested in the rival PNPR (or "Radical Nationalist Party"). However, as historian Vlad Gafița notes, his attempt to participate in the latter was hampered by his professional work: for a while, he worked as a bank clerk in [[Moravia]].&lt;ref&gt;Gafița (2009), p. 157. See also Bălan, p. 9; Cocuz, pp. 313, 443; Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 18–19; Iațencu &amp; Olaru, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Onciul had antagonized other Romanians by taking sides with the Austrian officials, in turn accused of playing community leaders against each other, or of "[[Machiavellianism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 7–8, 164. See also Iațencu &amp; Olaru, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholar [[Irina Livezeanu]], the "relative liberalism" of the Austrian administration promoted an "accommodationist" climate, in which the elites were less tempted to group on competitive national bases—Onciul illustrated such a spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Teodor Bălan believes that Onciul's ascendancy was directly owed to the new [[List of Governors of Bukovina|Governor of Bukovina]], [[Prince Konrad of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst|Konrad zu Hohenlohe]], who wished to calm the situation after a season of Romanian–Ukrainian political battles. For this, he needed "a political program with economic demands, which would exclude the national question" and "replace political romanticism with realism."&lt;ref&gt;Bălan, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Onciul validated these priorities by turning to a moderate nationalism which favored an "entente with the Ruthenians, national autonomy, cultivation of the vernacular, and a more intimate relationship with Romanians abroad."&lt;ref&gt;Olaru (1994), p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;

Onciul first took a seat in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Austrian House of Deputies]] during the [[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1900–1901|January 1901 election]], which he contested at [[Chernivtsi|Czernowitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallabrin, p. 40; Iațencu &amp; Olaru, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; By October, he was publicizing his critique of the PNPR, accusing it of passivity. According to Onciul, the "old men" of Bukovina's politics endorsed a radical program on paper, knowing full well that they would never apply it.&lt;ref&gt;"Din Bucovina", in ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'', Nr. 225/1902, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying with the "youth", the PȚD was formally established in early 1902, but took almost a year to emerge as an organized group: in January 1903, it published its "Democratic Program", and on February 2, held its first congress, as "the Political Society Unirea or Democratic Peasants' Party".&lt;ref&gt;Gafița (2009), pp. 157, 158, 172. See also Cocuz, pp. 310, 311, 317–318, 443; Corbea-Hoișie, p. 19; Diacon, pp. 136–137; Olaru (1994), p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Onciul was its president, seconded by Grigore Halip and George Hostiuc; Unirea's first motto was ''Înainte, nimănui spre daună, tuturor spre bine''  ("Forward, with bad outcomes for none and good outcomes for all").&lt;ref&gt;Olaru (1994), p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

Onciul, who was the party president, made his entry into politics at an inauspicious time, when the Concordia Conservatives and the PNPR had agreed to merge back into a single party, headed by [[Iancu Flondor]]. This challenge guided the PȚD unorthodox strategy, including its alliances and its attacks on other Romanian leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Gafița (2009), p. 157. See also Cocuz, pp. 315–317&lt;/ref&gt; The latter were carried in the two party newspapers, ''Privitorul'' ("The Onlooker") and ''Voința Poporului'' ("The People's Will"), both of which had been founded in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 308, 310, 312, 317, 325; Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 18–22, 42–47; Diacon, p. 137; Gafița (2009), pp. 157, 160, 170; Olaru (1994), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Onciul's brother in law, the Conservative [[Florea Lupu]], came out in support of these attacks. Together with his refusal to accept the PNPR merger, this stance caused him to be expelled from Concordia—although he held on to his seat in the House.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 301–302, 312&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positioning===
[[File:Greater austria ethnic.svg|thumb|370px|Map of the [[United States of Greater Austria]], as proposed by [[Aurel Popovici]], superimposed over the majority ethnic groups. The Romanians (in orange) are largely grouped into "[[Transylvania]]", which has absorbed Bukovina to the north-east]]
In its propaganda, the PȚD accused the "[[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar]]" elite of having exploited the peasant class and the rural [[intelligentsia]], claiming to expose elitist nationalism as a scheme; it advocated its populist nationalism of a distinctly left-wing hue.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 301–302; Gafița (2009), pp. 157–158, 171–172&lt;/ref&gt; ''Privitorul'' deplored "boyar" elitism, and exposed the non-Romanian origins of various families forming the conservative ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Olaru (1994), pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gafița, Onciul and his followers saw themselves as emancipated progressives: "profoundly loyal" to the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], capable of seeing beyond national divisions, and even open to the idea of a trans-ethnic, [[Austrian nationalism]]. Gafița also sees Onciul as employing "[[doublespeak]]" on this issue, and of willingly fashioning himself to be the diametrical opposite of Flondor.&lt;ref&gt;Gafița (2009), pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Ioan Cocuz, one of Onciul's staunchest critics,&lt;ref&gt;Gafița (2009), p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; describes him as "wholly unscrupulous", as well as "anti-national", "a loyal Austrian".&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 311–312&lt;/ref&gt; However, researcher Mihai Iacobescu writes that the PȚD agenda may have been "hesitant, contradictory, dissolving", but not truly "anti-national".&lt;ref&gt;Iacobescu, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Onciul firmly believed that Austria had united the small peoples of [[East-Central Europe]], and that this had protected them from being absorbed into the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Bălan, pp. 15–16, 84–86; Corbea-Hoișie, p. 48. See also de Szász, pp. 6–8, 10&lt;/ref&gt; While preserving imperial rule, he favored a multicultural approach, with each people granted "independent organization and management", especially over language education.&lt;ref&gt;"Zuid-Afrika. Een Les uit Oostenrijk", in ''Neerlandia'', Year 9, 1905, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The process leading to additional federalism was a form of ''[[suum cuique]]'', with the [[Moravian Diet]] as a working model of ethnic cohabitation.&lt;ref&gt;Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas on the topic were overall similar with the "[[United States of Greater Austria]]" designs of [[Aurel Popovici]],&lt;ref&gt;Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 48–49; de Szász, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; as acknowledged by Popovici himself.&lt;ref&gt;Popovici, pp. 96, 320&lt;/ref&gt; Onciul also extended this federal model to solve the national issue of Romanians being divided over several states: a scheme proposed by ''Privitorul'' around 1902 was to somehow incorporate the [[Kingdom of Romania]] into Austria.&lt;ref&gt;"Nouvelles du jour", in ''[[La Liberté (Switzerland)|La Liberté]]'', July 12, 1902, p. 1; Bălan, pp. 16, 84; [[Nicolae Iorga]], [[Constantin Bacalbașa]], ''Istoria presei românești'', p. 156. Bucharest: [[Adevărul|Adevĕrul]], 1922; Popovici, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

As Livezeanu observes: "Aurel Onciul's National Democratic Party [...] brought together liberal Romanians who favored ethnic compromise and opposed the [[social conservatism]] of the National Party."&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nicolae Iorga]], the historian and nationalist polemicist, Onciul became especially adept at manipulating the schoolteachers and peasants against the aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Iacobescu, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; Cocuz similarly suggests that Onciul and Lupu relied on an "incitement" tactic: "setting the class of Romanian schoolteachers against the national Romanian parties".&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; A major point of contention was class representation within the [[Diet of Bukovina]], with Onciul noting that 150 "boyars" elected 10 parliamentarians, while 18,000 peasants and 70,000 proletarians elected one deputy each.&lt;ref&gt;Olaru (1994), pp. 285–286&lt;/ref&gt; The party's original manifesto argued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For ten years now, we have repeatedly tried to reason with our boyars into giving the people its fair share of public life, but all our attempts have been in vain. The boyars never ceased confiscating the people's electoral right, and to abuse it in order to grow rich and occupy for themselves offices on the people's money and for the people's perdition. Given this, we have no other road left but the fight against boyars in order to gain our electoral liberty and with it the people's legitimate influence over its own destiny. [Unirea Society is] a point of convergence for honest, national and democratic, Romanian politics.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 310; Gafița (2009), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Bucov.png|thumb|300px|Ethnic map of Bukovina in 1930: Ukrainians in pale green, Romanians in purple, Jews in yellow and Germans in black]]
The effect of this discourse is assessed by Gafița as follows: "The democrats' orientation toward predominantly social demands, as opposed to those of a national-political substance reaped momentary electoral gains, but also numerous losses for the Romanian emancipation movement as a whole. The latter was submerged and weakened by a climate of internal conflict, but also by the spread of left-wing concepts, such as the [[class conflict]] of peasants and boyars, inside the Romanian camp."&lt;ref&gt;Gafița (2009), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Andrei Corbea-Hoișie also notes that Onciul's platform "was not based on the strict national doctrine of the established [National Party], but on [the] goals of left-liberal social and political progress". Rather than representing the peasantry, the group was vying "for the favor of the Romanian middle class".&lt;ref&gt;Corbea-Hoișie, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Freisinnige Verband''===
Onciul and Lupu were elected to the regional Diet in the by-elections of June 1903, allegedly with a mixture of Romanian and Ukrainian votes.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1903, the PȚD leader established in [[Vienna]] a trans-ethnic League for Electoral Reform, which became in June 1904 the Liberal Alliance or ''Freisinnige Verband'' ("[[Freethought|Freethinkers]]' Alliance"). Its other leaders were: Staucher, the German [[Arthur Skedl]], the Romanian [[Ukrainophilia|Ukrainophile]] [[Nikolai von Wassilko]], and the "Young Ukrainian" [[Stepan Smal-Stotskyi]].&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 319; Gafița (2009), pp. 161, 168. See also Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 14, 19–21, 31–33; Diacon, pp. 139–140; Livezeanu, p. 56; Olaru (1994), pp. 281–282, 286–287&lt;/ref&gt; This act remains one of enduring controversy among Romanians: Cocuz argues that Smal-Stotskyi intended to use the ''Verband'' as an advancement tool for the Ukrainians. According to Smal-Stotskyi, his group was a "[[Proletarian nation|subjugated nation]]", which could succeed "only within the titular nations."&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Cocuz speculates that this policy was suggested to Onciul by Hohenlohe, in a bid do undermine the PNPR.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

During June 1903, Onciul publicly announced that electoral reform was his chief political goal, and that upon its adoption he would retire to Moravia.&lt;ref&gt;Olaru (1994), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in autumn, he approached Flondor and the Conservatives to discuss Bukovina's democratization, following blueprints drafted by [[Benno Straucher]], the Jewish politician. Both also negotiated with Hohenlohe and with the [[List of Ministers-President of Austria|Austrian Minister-President]], [[Ernest von Koerber]]. The agreement between the groups also included their future merger into a "Unitary Romanian Party", its ideological stance to be decided by [[grassroots democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 308–309, 319–322; Gafița (2009), pp. 160–165&lt;/ref&gt; However, the electoral reform project had lost Flondor's support, which also caused the merger project to unravel. It remains poorly understood why Flondor opted to back out: he may have reactivated his Concordia nationalism, as the electoral reform unwittingly gave electoral leverage to the urbanized German and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 319; Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 31–33; Gafița (2009), pp. 163–165&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Cocuz claims that the merger deal was suspicious, and that the PNPR never truly accepted it as such. He also believes that Onciul was being hypocritical, offering the merger but still caucusing with the Ukrainians, "the Romanians' most bitter ethnic enemies", and refusing to tone down his attacks on Flondor.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 308–309, 319–321, 318, 321–322&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived anti-reform attitude of Flondor and the PNPR pushed the PȚD into a near-complete isolation. On November 10, Onciul, Straucher, Smal-Stotskyi, Wassilko, [[Hierotheus Pihuliak]] and [[Theodor Lewicki]] signed a manifesto condemning the Romanian parties in exceptionally harsh terms, accusing them of having stalled democratic progress.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; Such moves upset the moderate Hostiuc, who resigned from the PȚD for fear of becoming a "tool to our enemies".&lt;ref&gt;Olaru (1994), p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; The PȚD intensified its outreach efforts toward the Ukrainian, German and Jewish politicians, coordinating attacks on Flondor—during what became known as the "Flondor Affair", anti-PNPR forces in the Diet accused Flondor of spreading [[antisemitism]], and forced his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 303–310; Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 31–33; Diacon, p. 138; Gafița (2009), pp. 164–171&lt;/ref&gt; In the Diet, Onciul also accused Flondor of secretly sabotaging his electoral campaign; he was in turn accused by his adversary of being an "international agent".&lt;ref&gt;Gafița (2009), pp. 166, 167&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to forge a lasting alliance with Smal-Stotskyi, he also challenged in ''Privitorul'' the core theses of Concordia nationalists. He suggested that German colonization in Bukovina could only benefit the local Romanians, and help them learn new trades.&lt;ref&gt;Gafița (2009), pp. 159, 172&lt;/ref&gt; From the Diet rostrum, Lupu also praised the Germanic talent for administration, seemingly with his brother-in-law's acquiescence.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 315–316&lt;/ref&gt;

Onciul became especially controversial in Romanian circles when he first claimed that all Bukovinans were [[East Slavs]], some of whom had been [[Romanianization|Romanianized]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbea-Hoișie, p. 14; Diacon, p. 165; Olaru (1994), pp. 282–284 &amp; (2002), pp. 498–499&lt;/ref&gt; Onciul's other essays denied the existence of [[Ukrainization]] in northern Bukovina, claiming that the [[Cheremosh River|Cheremosh Valley]] had always been a Ukrainian heartland; this stance was immediately challenged from within the party by Zaharia Voronca.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 313–317, 443; Gafița (2009), pp. 159–160; Olaru (1994), pp. 282–284, 286. See also Iațencu &amp; Olaru, pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, Lupu had been expelled by the leading nationalist club, ''[[Societatea Academică Junimea]]'', after ridiculing the [[Flag of Romania|Romanian tricolor]]; Onciul himself resigned from ''Junimea'' in December 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Diacon, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Condemned as "anti-Romanian", Onciul and Lupu also found themselves expelled from the cultural society ''România Jună'' in 1904. During the polemic that followed, PȚD men dismissed ''România Jună'' as an instrument of "the boyars" and a "herd of bovines".&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 325; Gafița (2009), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; A pro-Onciul wing of the club broke off as Dacia Society, which counted [[Filaret Doboș]] and [[George Tofan]] among its leading members.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 317; Jumară, pp. 173–176&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progressive Peasants' Fellowship and ''Arcași''===
[[File:Stautute of the Arcași in Bilca, 1909.png|thumb|370px|1909 statute of the ''Arcași'' in [[Bilca]], outlining their role in firefighting, physical education, and civil culture, as well as their participation in the [[temperance movement]] (''tesvie'')]]
During the political realignment that followed Flondor's resignation, Ociul was able to succeed with his policy of alliances outside his ethic group, creating a tight alliance around the 1903 League. This "[[Progressive Peasants' Fellowship]]", presided over by Onciul, together with Skedl, Smal-Stotskyi and [[Georg Graf Wassilko von Serecki]], took the majority vote (17 out of 31 seats) in 1904 elections for the Diet; the PNPR had dissolved itself, and a Conservative (or "Pactist") Party, under [[Ioan Volcinschi]], took 4 seats.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 322–331, 443; Gafița (2009), pp. 167–171, 173–174. See also Diacon, pp. 137–139, 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; Onciul, Graf Wassilko and Lupu all won seats in this arrangement, as did their PȚD colleagues [[Teofil Simionovici]] and Alexandru Buburuzan; a sixth was won when the front-runner [[Varteres von Prunkul]], an [[Armenians in Austria|Armenian]], renounced in favor of the PȚD man Tit Onciul.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 325–327, 330–331, 332&lt;/ref&gt; An inner-Fellowship agreement prevented the PȚD from putting up candidates in the six majority-Ukrainian constituencies, and in turn guaranteed Ukrainian votes in the majority-Romanian ones.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 325–327&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this reshuffling, Graf Wassilko became ''[[Landeshauptmann]]'', with Smal-Stotskyi as his lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 328; Gafița (2009), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Their arrival to power brought with it the adoption of Straucher's democratic reform. There followed liberal and nationalist bills (including the establishment of a state bank, the lifting of [[propination laws]], and the creation of a Romanian History Chair at [[Chernivtsi University|Francis Joseph University]]), but the more radical measures proposed by the PȚD were vetoed by Koerber.&lt;ref&gt;Gafița (2009), pp. 169, 173. See also Cocuz, pp. 353–356; Diacon, pp. 137–138; Gafița (2006), p. 117; Olaru (1994), p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the Fellowship began rupturing around ethnic lines. This had been a backup option for Onciul, who had vetoed Graf Wassilko's proposal to fuse the distinct Fellowship clubs into unitary, non-ethnic, sections.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 322, 330–332&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while in 1905, the PȚD press had no real challenge in Bukovina's cultural-political setting.&lt;ref&gt;Iacobescu, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; As the PNPR reconstituted itself around [[Dorimedont Popovici]] and the paper ''Apărarea Națională'', Onciul himself began pressing for Flondor's return to politics, and for a reunification of Romanian nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 330–331, 337–338; Gafița (2009), p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; The party exposed anti-Romanian sentiments expressed by the other Fellowship partners (in particular by Smal-Stotskyi) and Ukrainian attempts to control the regional bank, and won instead support from various German deputies.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 331–333&lt;/ref&gt; Onciul became expressly committed to economic nationalism and [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]], and more critical of Austria's internal colonization policies. ''Privitorul'' claimed that: "Mass auctioning of both peasant granges and large-scale properties has steadily brought down the number of our settled population. It is being replaced by legions of foreigners who share neither our custom nor our language, and the pitiful Romanian people, sucked to its marrow by the tolerated usurers, is driven to all corners of the Earth by the indifference of present-day potentates."&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

This interval in power also saw the creation of Romanian paramilitary and self-help units, called the ''Arcași'' ("Bowmen").&lt;ref&gt;Diacon, pp. 67–70; Freitag &amp; Păun, ''passim''; Gafița (2009), p. 169; Jumară, pp. 173–176&lt;/ref&gt; The groups were consciously modeled as a mixture of [[volunteer fire department]]s and ''[[Sokol]]'' clubs.&lt;ref name="sclt"&gt;E. Scalat, "Din Țara Fagilor. Dela redacția noastră din Cernăuți", in ''Cultura Poporului'', July 23, 1925, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; They were identified by their white shirts,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 185; Gurza, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; but also wore ribbons echoing the Romanian tricolor.&lt;ref&gt;Freitag &amp; Păun, pp. 645–647; Jumară, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; The first such units, also active within the [[temperance movement]], were set up in [[Frătăuții Vechi|Alt Fratautz]] and [[Todirești, Suceava|Parhautz]].&lt;ref&gt;Freitag &amp; Păun, pp. 645–647&lt;/ref&gt; Their creation signaled the Onciul and Lupu wanted to expand beyond their bourgeois constituency and actively involve the Romanian peasantry in regional politics.&lt;ref&gt;Jumară, pp. 173–176&lt;/ref&gt; They were often involved in skirmishes with the Ukrainian ''Sich'' clubs, "reaching out for their knives and revolvers."&lt;ref name="sclt"/&gt;

On May 28, 1905, the Fellowship was denounced by the PȚD, and ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 333, 445&lt;/ref&gt; During that interval, Onciul had a bitter polemic with Wassilko and Straucher's newspaper, ''Bukowinaer Post''.&lt;ref&gt;Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 21, 23–24, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17, the PȚD merged into [[Modest Grigorcea]]'s reconstructed National Romanian Party (PNR), but continued to function informally as a Democratic wing, still putting out ''Voința Poporului'' to October 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 333–334, 340–341, 389–392, 445&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the PȚD proudly accepted the label of a Romanian "irredentist" group, allowing its ''Arcași'' delegates to attend the 25th anniversary of the Romanian Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Jumară, pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt; Although an old rival of Onciul's, [[Nicolae Iorga]] joined Dacia Society as an honorary member.&lt;ref&gt;Jumară, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; He was then persuaded by Tofan to mediate between Onciul and Flondor, trying to reunite them around a nativist slogan, "Bukovina for the Romanians".&lt;ref&gt;Iacobescu, pp. 91, 102–103&lt;/ref&gt; Running on PNR lists for the by-elections of [[Chernivtsi|Chernowitz]]—[[Siret|Sereth]]—[[Storozhynets|Storozynetz]], Onciul easily won a seat in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Austrian House of Deputies]], and was reelected at [[Gura Humorului|Gura Humora]] in the [[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1907|full-term elections of 1907]].&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 340–344. See also Diacon, pp. 70, 149–151; Hallabrin, pp. 41, 48&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Dacia, the ''Arcași'' were important electoral agents for Onciul.&lt;ref&gt;Diacon, p. 70; Jumară, pp. 174–175&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the time, the faction drew its funds from corrupt practices, taking over control of the local [[Raiffeisen Bankengruppe (Austria)|Raiffeisen credit union]], which Lupu, as president of the public bank, used for high-risk investments in the forestry business.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 389–392, 429, 434–439, 444–445, 448; Olaru (2002), p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions were again running high between the Romanians and the Ukrainians, with the latter openly calling for Bukovina to be merged into [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia-Lodomeria]] as a single "Ruthenian province".&lt;ref&gt;Bălan, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Reversing the Ukrainian political ascendancy, Onciul and other PȚD figures undermined Smal-Stotskyi's constituency by joining hands with the mainly Orthodox [[Western Ukrainian Russophiles|Ukrainian Russophiles]] against the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek-Catholics]].&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; However, former associate N. Wassilko sponsored Lupu with money for the regional bank, receiving instead guarantees that opponents of Wassilko's would not find themselves in eligible positions.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 444–445; Diacon, pp. 161–162&lt;/ref&gt; A new Governor, [[Rudolf Graf von Meran]], observed the Onciul–Lupu partnership and began issuing calls and warnings toward Bukovina's "healing".&lt;ref&gt;Diacon, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, Onciul began advocating electoral reform in [[Cisleithania]], supporting the over-representation of Germans, Italians and Romanians as a counterweight to the Slavic vote.&lt;ref&gt;"Deputatul Onciul despre reforma electorală în Austria", in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 54/1906, pp. 2&lt;/ref&gt; However, the PȚD slid into hostility toward the local Jews. ''Voința Poporului'' openly embraced [[economic antisemitism]] during the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' revolt|peasants' revolt in neighboring Romania]], indirectly criticizing the Jewish middle class in Bukovina.&lt;ref&gt;Matei Ionescu, Corina Pătrașcu, "Cu privire la poziția unor puteri europene față de răscoala din 1907", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Nr. 1/1957, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; Other newspapers, secretly ran by Onciul, published more direct attacks on rich Jews. Such venues include ''Die Wahrheit'', edited by [[Mihail Chisanovici]], and ''Bukowinaer Lloyd'', whose publisher was a Jewish man, Emanuel Goldenberg.&lt;ref&gt;Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 35–36, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1908, the PNR, including its Democratic wing, merged with the ''Apărarea Națională'' group to form the [[Christian Social Romanian Party of Bukovina]] (PCSR). It offered its presidency to Flondor, who (despite having qualms about the inclusion of a PȚD group) accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 347–349&lt;/ref&gt; Although claiming to represent, above all, the local interest of the Romanians, the new party also functioned as a Bukovinan simile of [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Austria's Christian Social Party]] (CS), fully adopting its antisemitic theses.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 350–359; Corbea-Hoișie, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by Corbea-Hoișie, Onciul initially denied the connection, stating that he and the CS had no common ideological ground; however, Onciul ended up with a "decisive role" in the "brutal enforcement of antisemitic commonplaces and slogans in public discourse."&lt;ref&gt;Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 15, 24&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Onciul expanded his polemic with Straucher and other local Jews to an imperial scale, arguing that "vampire" Jews had taken hold of the Austro-Hungarian press, and would eventually subjugate the economy. He also alleged that a conspiracy of German and Jewish interests had blocked out his project to tax the alcohol industry and redirect funding toward public education.&lt;ref&gt;Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 32–34&lt;/ref&gt; Radicalized by his readings from [[Karl Lueger]], by 1909 Onciul was writing that [[Christianity and Judaism]] were incompatible, and that Jews were anarchic "bloodsuckers" or "well-poisoners". He proposed [[racial segregation]], euphemistically defined as "Christian self-determination".&lt;ref&gt;Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 36–38&lt;/ref&gt; Onciul extended some of his nativist criticism to include the [[Poles in Romania|Bukovina Poles]], engaging in public debates with another deputy, [[Krzysztof Abrahamowicz]].&lt;ref&gt;"Kronika bukowińskich Polaków/Cronica polonezilor bucovineni. Październik/Octombrie 1907", in ''Polonus. Pismo Zwiazku Polaków w Rumunii/Revista Uniunii Polonezilor din România'', Issue 10 (240), 2016, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Onciul also worked intensely to unify the various Romanian groups under the antisemitic banner, and also publicly denounced liberalism in all its forms, insisting that the PȚD had always stood for the "thoroughly conservative peasantry".&lt;ref&gt;Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 38–40, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; On January 31, 1909, after co-opting various other factions, the PCSR became a "Romanian National Party", with Flondor reconfirmed as leader—essentially a reunion of Concordia. Also then, as a result of Onciul's networking, the party became formally allied with the Austrian CS, though still as an "independent corporation".&lt;ref&gt;"Românii bucovineni și partidul creștin-social", in ''Tribuna'', Nr. 19/1909, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being one of the two vice presidents, Onciul continued to antagonize his colleagues, preserved the Democratic wing as an informal party division, and was suspected of conspiring against Flondor.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 353–356, 359, 360, 375–384; Diacon, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

During the congress of November 1911, Flondor announced his resignation; Onciul was reconfirmed as vice president, delivering a speech about the coming victory of the Romanian element over the Ruthenians. He noted that there was little reason to worry, since, despite official census data, Romanians had a sizable majority.&lt;ref&gt;Coresp., "Adunarea națională a Românilor bucovineni", in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 224/1910, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; The party was able to coalesce again in April 1911, when its candidates, including Onciul, Lupu and Simionovici, won seats against a rising left-wing threat, the [[Social Democratic Party of Bukovina]]—this was celebrated in the party press as a victory of "nationality and law" against "[[Proletarian internationalism|international socialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 379–380, 382–383&lt;/ref&gt;

After this victory, Onciul was able to reform the electoral law, tightening the concept of ethnic representation, splitting voters into ethnic caucuses, and eliminating [[indirect suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;Diacon, pp. 155–160&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, on June 20, 1911, the PCSR/PNR effectively split, following a publicized row between Onciul and Popovici.&lt;ref&gt;Coresp., "Scandalul din dieta Bucovineĭ. Partidul unitar românesc nu mai există", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', June 27, 1911, p. 1; Diacon, pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1911|House election of July 1911]], Lupu was defeated at [[Boiany|Bojan]] by [[Constantin Isopescu-Grecul]], who claimed that the Raiffeisen scheme had been intended to destroy the Bukovinan Romanian banks.&lt;ref&gt;"Știri din Bucovina", in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 120/1911, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; The relaunched Democrats (also "Democratic Peasantists", or "National Peasantists"), putting out a newspaper ''Foaia Poporului'' ("People's Sheet"), resumed their attacks on the Concordia establishment, this time claiming to represent the true voice of Romanian nationalism in a populist and [[Anticlericalism|anticlerical]] variant.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 428–431, 451&lt;/ref&gt; Other attacks focused on pan-Romanian nationalists based in the [[Kingdom of Romania]]—in particular the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians|Cultural League]]. Although Chisanovici joined Isopescu-Grecul on a goodwill tour of the Kingdom, he and Onciul were denounced as Austrian agents, and measures were taken to cut down Romanian subsidies for ''Foaia Poporului''.&lt;ref&gt;Gafița (2006), pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

Depicting the rump PNR as party "of parsons and kikes" acting "on government orders", ''Foaia Poporului'' was in turn attacked as a "sellout to Jewish finance".&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 429, 431, 432&lt;/ref&gt; Although, by 1911, Onciul had toned down his and his party's antisemitism, he still believed that the Jews were obstacles to his federalist project, in that they often supported centralization.&lt;ref&gt;Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 40, 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, Onciul was again open to collaboration with the Ukrainians, by proposing that the contested [[Metropolis of Bukovina|Orthodox Bishopric of Bukovina]] be informally split between the Romanian and Ukrainian churchgoers.&lt;ref&gt;"Cronică bisericească-culturală", in ''Revista Teologică'', Vol. V, Issue 5, March 1911, p. 160; Cocuz, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian conservative establishment complained about the Ukrainization of churches, but Onciul disagreed. Like many in the Ukrainian press, he suggested that there was a "denationalization of the Ruthenians by Romanians".&lt;ref&gt;Gafița (2006), p. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; He also hoped that, through promises of [[debt restructuring]] for Ukrainian credit unions, who would obtain the establishment of a regional credit cooperative, to be presided upon by him.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I disputes===
The Raiffeisen  fiasco prompted Onciul to consider restoring his old party.&lt;ref&gt;Diacon, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The PȚD reemerged formally at [[Chernivtsi|Czernowitz]] on April 26, 1914, under the name of "Peasants' Party", and with Onciul reconfirmed as president. Its other leading members included Lupu, Buburuzan, Doboș, and Chisanovici.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 439, 444&lt;/ref&gt; Onciul and Simionovici held the party's two of the five Romanian seats in the House, which were collectively grouped as a "Romanian Club" caucus; the three other seats were held by Isopescu-Grecul and [[Gheorghe Sârbu]] of the PNR, and by [[Alexandru Hurmuzachi]], an independent.&lt;ref&gt;Bălan, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The group's generic populism was replaced with agrarianism: it claimed to have divorced from the intelligentsia, and to be focused on "ensuring that the peasants are happy"—according to Cocuz, this reinvention was "ridiculous" and "farcical".&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 445–447&lt;/ref&gt;

The party also restated its loyalism, declaring itself hostile to projects of union between Bukovina and Romania. Onciul had a publicized row with [[Ion Grămadă]] and other young Romanian nationalists, whom he denounced as "irredentists".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dimitrie Marmeliuc]], [[Ioan Andrieșescu]], ''Eroului dela Cireșoaia: I. Grămadă. 20 ani dela moartea sa. Omagiu prietenesc și camaraderesc (Două conferinţe)'', p. 10. Cernăuți: [[Societatea Academică Junimea|Junimea Literară]], 1936&lt;/ref&gt; By April, his renewed attacks on the Cultural League and its "chauvinism" created a stir in Romanian nationalist circles. These responded by calling Onciul a "traitor" and "alcoholic".&lt;ref&gt;"Un nou trădător de neam", in ''Românul'' (Arad), Nr. 65/1914, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; During a Diet session on June 14, Onciul clashed with the nationalist deputy Aurel Țurcanu, hitting him with a clot of [[blotting paper]].&lt;ref&gt;Gafița (2006), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; As Onciul put it at the time: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;the squires' gazettes and the priests have this practice of wailing and grumbling against the Empire and of abasing [the Empire] in Romania's eyes. This wailing, grumbling and abasing had found a strong echo in Romania, ruining the friendship between that country and Our Empire, that which is harmful to both countries. Our hearts aching, we stood up to this cavalcade, and we asked those in the Kingdom to mind their own business and leave us to our own fate, and to stop meddling in our affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 449. See also Diacon, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:1915-ianuarie-8-ADEVARUL-Romania-vegheaza.jpg|thumb|300px|Cartoon in ''[[Adevărul]]'', January 1915, mocking Romania's neutrality during the massacres of Bukovina's "legionaries"]]
The [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Sarajevo Assassination]] of June 28 took Austria-Hungary into World War I, and meant the effective end of the party, which had had no meaningful activity after establishing itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 450; Diacon, pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt; Nominally, however, the Peasantist group continued to be represented in the House until late 1918, through Onciul and Simionovici.&lt;ref&gt;Bălan, pp. 82, 84&lt;/ref&gt; From the early stages of war, Onciul was more radical than the Concordia elites in supporting the Austrian cause, adopting the imperial slogan ''[[A.E.I.O.U.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bălan, pp. 14, 15&lt;/ref&gt; This issue took the forefront in July 1914, at the Schoolteachers' Congress in [[Suceava|Suczawa]]. Onciul and Chisanovici tried to prevent it from taking place, claiming that it would be used for promoting irredentism.&lt;ref name="maior"&gt;Iuliu Maior, "Pagini științifice. Impresii din Bucovina", in ''Unirea. Foaie Bisericească-Politică'', Nr. 75/1914, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; He later openly accused a guest speaker, [[Onisifor Ghibu]], of "high treason" against Austria.&lt;ref&gt;"Din Bucovina", in ''Românul'' (Arad), Nr. 158/1914, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported by scholar Iuliu Maior, the teachers' congress showed Onciul's desperation that the PȚD was losing political relevancy.&lt;ref name="maior"/&gt; Around that time, some former leading members of the party were indeed growing reluctant of endorsing the Austrian project—Tit Onciul was arrested as a traitor by the [[Gendarmerie (Austria)|Gendarmerie]], and reputedly mistreated.&lt;ref&gt;Iațencu &amp; Olaru, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Russian occupation of Eastern Galicia, 1914–15|Russian invasion of November]], Aurel Onciul and Buburuzan formed defense units of "legionaries" among the Romanians, comprising up to 1,500 irregulars; N. Wassilko did the same among the [[Hutsuls]].&lt;ref&gt;Bălan, pp. 24–26, 118. See also Iațencu &amp; Olaru, pp. 78–80&lt;/ref&gt; These largely peasant troops were notoriously untrained and under-equipped, wearing civilian clothes and [[Habsburg flag|black-yellow armbands]], and were consequently decimated by the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Bălan, pp. 25–29; Iațencu &amp; Olaru, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

For the following year, with Romania [[Romania in World War I|still neutral]], Onciul supported schemes that would prevent her joining the war against Austria and the other [[Central Powers]]. Together with the [[Bessarabia]]n [[Constantin Stere]], he sought to obtain more collective rights for Romanians in [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Transleithania]], and thus prevent Romania from having a ''[[casus belli]]''; he believed that the best scenario was for Romania to fight alongside Austria, and receive Bessarabia as a reward, or even to be peacefully annexed by the empire.&lt;ref&gt;de Szász, pp. 6–8. See also Iacobescu, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The latter proposal vexed Iorga, who replied that "Romania as a state is no Belgium, to exist [only] as a customs office", but the representation of a "healthy people, with its future ahead."&lt;ref&gt;Iacobescu, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Also then, Onciul mediated between the Romanians of [[Transylvania]] and the [[Prime Minister of Hungary]], [[István Tisza]], asking Tisza to curb [[Magyarization]] policies, reform the electoral law, and give semiofficial status to the Romanian language.&lt;ref&gt;"'Comunicarea' lui Aurel Onciul către contele Tisza István", in ''Analele Bucovinei'', Vol. X, Issue 2, 2003, pp. 509–529&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|Romania declared war on the Central Powers]], what remained of the PȚD was further split. Doboș deserted to the Romanian side, then helped organized Romanian political clubs and a [[Romanian Volunteer Corps in Russia|Volunteer Corps]] in the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Vasile Netea, "Lupta emigrației transilvane pentru desăvîrșirea unității de stat a României", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Nr. 6/1968, p. 1156. See also Jumară, p. 176; Livezeanu, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; He himself noted that "many" of his colleagues in Dacia Society followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;Jumară, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1917, Doboș joined [[Sever Bocu]] and [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] at the Congress of Nationalities from Austria-Hungary, held in [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Botoran, Constantin Stan, "Acțiuni comune ale românilor, cehilor și slovacilor în lupta pentru făurirea statelor naționale unitare și independente și pentru recunoașterea lor internațională (1916–1920)", in ''Revista de Istorie'', Nr. 11/1988, p. 1087&lt;/ref&gt; As Romania experienced heavy losses and [[Battle of Bucharest|its capital fell]], Onciul radicalized his opinions on the issue of irredentism. He argued for the annexation of Romania to fulfill Romanian unity under one crown; he also called for Austria to cede its Ukrainian regions to a Ukrainian state, and for [[West Galicia]] to fuse into a [[Kingdom of Poland (1916–18)|German-aligned Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Bălan, pp. 85–87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Termination and survivals===

Throughout most of 1918, still a representative of Bukovina in the House, Onciul supported plans for the region's partition on an ethnic basis.&lt;ref name="ashuț208"&gt;Alin Spânu, "Huțanii (huțulii) în studiul Serviciului de Informații al Jandarmeriei (1943)", in Vasile Ciobanu, Sorin Radu (eds.), ''Partide politice și minorități naționale din România în secolul XX'', Vol. IV, p. 208. Sibiu: TechnoMedia, 2009.  {{ISBN|978-606-8030-53-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 4, present at Czernowitz, he and Lupu were elected to the 50-member National Romanian Council, which rejected partition and also proposed merging the whole of Bukovina with Transylvania, to form an independent Romanian state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vasile Bianu]], ''Insemnări din răsboiul României Mari. Tomul II: Dela mobilizare până la pacea din București'', p. 94. Cluj: Institutul de Arte Grafice Ardealul, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; Alone among the Romanian intellectuals, Onciul refused to abide by this agenda,&lt;ref&gt;Bălan, pp. 96–98; Pușcariu, p. 396; Ungureanu, pp. 39–41&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to his adversaries, did everything in his power to obstruct their work.&lt;ref&gt;Iațencu &amp; Olaru, pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; During negotiations, he threatened the anti-Austrian [[Sextil Pușcariu]], hinting that Pușcariu risked a death sentence for his disloyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Cernov, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Onciul refused to recognize the National Council as a constitutional body, and instigated other Romanian Club members to do the same. This effort collapsed: parliamentarians Sârbu and [[George Grigorovici]] refused to follow Onciul's lead, and returned to Czernowitz.&lt;ref&gt;Cernov, pp. 89–90; Pușcariu, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;

''Foaia Poporului'', published as a newspaper of the "National Peasants' Party", continued to press for the loyalist agenda during October,&lt;ref&gt;Cernov, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; although the empire slowly disintegrated ''(see [[Republic of German-Austria]])''. On November 6, as a self-appointed representative of the Romanians, Onciul agreed to divide Bukovina with the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], which was represented locally by [[Omelian Popovych]].&lt;ref&gt;Bălan, pp. 94–95, 134–135; Corbea-Hoișie, p. 14; Livezeanu, p. 58; Pușcariu, pp. 396–397; Vasyl Rasevych, "The Western Ukrainian People’s Republic of 1918–1919", in Wolfram Dornik, Georgiy Kasianov, Hannes Leidinger, Peter Lieb, [[Alexei I.

Though he still favored Greater Austrian federalism,&lt;ref&gt;Cernov, pp. 88, 89; Ungureanu, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Onciul welcomed the UHA.

Arrested for a while by the Romanian authorities, then released,&lt;ref name="ashuț208"/&gt; Onciul dedicated his last years to drafting plans for a large-scale [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]].&lt;ref&gt;Ștefan Purici, "Premisele reformei agrare din Bucovina (1918–1921)", in ''Analele Bucovinei'', Vol. XII, Issue 2, 2005, pp. 471–472. See also Olaru (2002), p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his essays, published in 1919, he acknowledged that Greater Romania had managed to fulfill the aspirations of his Bukovina constituents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Radu Grigorovici]], "Das Modell Bukowina/Modelul Bucovinei", in ''Analele Bucovinei'', Vol. III, Issue 2, 1996, pp. 269, 288&lt;/ref&gt; As a final political act, he presented himself as a candidate in the [[Romanian general election, 1920|election of May 1920]].&lt;ref&gt;Olaru (2002), p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; Onciul died in [[Bucharest]], where he ran his own law firm,&lt;ref&gt;Iațencu &amp; Olaru, pp. 75, 83–84; Ungureanu, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; on September 30, 1921.&lt;ref name="ashuț208"/&gt;

The white-shirted ''Arcași'' groups were revived as independent paramilitary associations, and, reorganized by folklorist Valerian Dugan-Opaiț, had some 500,000 members and over 55 sections in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 73, 185&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was reportedly slowed down by Romaniațs laws on legal entities, which the mostly-peasant organizers had trouble interpreting.&lt;ref name="sclt"/&gt; Also then, various sections were driven increasingly close to, and infiltrated by, the antisemitic far-right: as noted by Corbea-Hoișie, Onciul's own participation in diffusing antisemitic lore was partly responsible for this political evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Corbea-Hoișie, pp. 15–16, 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; From ca. 1923, various ''Arcași'' became sympathetic toward the [[National-Christian Defense League]] (LANC), and were in correspondence with its Bukovinan affiliate, [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], ultimately splitting from Dugan-Opaiț's apolitical mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 58, 60–61, 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, the LANC press also boasted a connection between the ''Arcași'' and Nicolae Totu, who had murdered the Jewish youth David Falik and was acquitted by a sympathetic jury.&lt;ref&gt;Ion Delapoiană, "Procesele noastre. Isbânda noastră", in ''Înfrățirea Românească'', Nr. 9/1927, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, it published a piece by Dugan-Opaiț, who claimed that [[Ion Nistor]], the Minister for Bukovina, wanted the ''Arcași'' banned, and that the movement had been marginalized during a national festival at [[Chișinău]].&lt;ref&gt;Valerian Dugan, "O ticăloșie fără seamăn", in ''Înfrățirea Românească'', Nr. 14/1928, pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt; The still-independent groups, supervised by Doboș (who was a member of the [[Senate of Romania]]), reorganized themselves in July of that year, allowing "each member to engage personally in whatever sort of politics".&lt;ref&gt;Em. Kos., "Congresul societăților arcășești din Bucovina. Dezbaterile din ziua a II-a au decis înlăturarea politicii", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', July 4, 1928, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, some breakaway ''Arcași'' lodges became subsections of Codreanu's own [[Iron Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 93, 211&lt;/ref&gt; Others, in large part recovered and again reorganized by Dumitru Străchinaru, remained primarily loyal to the [[King of the Romanians|Romanian King]], [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], and in 1935 marched at his "Feast of the Restoration".&lt;ref&gt;Gurza, pp. 49–50, 92&lt;/ref&gt; These ''Arcași'' received official protection, and by 1937 had expanded to 150 sections.&lt;ref&gt;Diacon, pp. 70–72&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Arcași'' movement and the Iron Guard were effectively banned in March 1937 by the government of [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]], which made it illegal to wear political uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 184–185&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August of that year they were again active, and Carol was ceremoniously confirmed as their "Great ''[[Vornic]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Traian Chelariu]], "Perspective bucovinene", in ''Cele Trei Crișuri'', Vol. XVIII, Issues 7–8, July–August 1937, pp. 152–154&lt;/ref&gt; By 1938, with Romania placed under Carol's [[National Renaissance Front]] dictatorship, the ''Arcași'' remained an auxiliary of the regime, and Doboș returned as their leader.&lt;ref&gt;Olimpia Mitric, "''Restitutio''.

{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
An '''ecclesiastical judge''' ({{lang-la|Judex -}}, or {{lang|la|Judex Ecclesiasticus}}) is an ecclesiastical person who possesses [[ecclesiastical jurisdiction]] either in general or in the strict sense. Up until 1858 when [[Ecclesiastical courts]] were abolished, ecclesiastical judges tried church clergy men in church courts or '''Ecclesiastical courts.''' Charges dealt in these courts were often very lenient, especially when dealt to church clergymen.

==Catholic canon law==
{{Very long|date=September 2009}}
The official body appointed by the qualified ecclesiastical authority for the administration of justice is called a court ({{lang|la|judicium ecclesiasticum, tribunal, auditorium}}) Every such court consists at the least of two sworn officials: the judge who gives the decision, and the [[clerk of the court]] ({{lang|la|scriba, secretarius, scriniarius, notarius, cancellarius}}), whose duty is to keep a record of the proceedings and the decision.&lt;ref&gt;(c. xi, X, De probat., II, xix)&lt;/ref&gt; As a rule, however, an ecclesiastical court forms a collegiate tribunal, the members of which either join with the presiding officer in giving the decision as judges ({{lang|la|judices}}) or merely advise with him as councillors ({{lang|la|auditores, assessores, consultores, consiliarii}}) (cc. xvi, xxi, xxii, xxiii, X, De off. et pot. jud. deleg., I, xxix).
 
Connected with the courts are advocates, procurators, syndics, defenders, promoters, [[Conservator (religion)|conservators]], [[apparitor]]s, [[Courier|messengers]] etc. The procurators and advocates conduct the case as the representatives or defenders of the parties to the suit;&lt;ref&gt;(X, De postul., I, xxxvii; X, De procurat., I, xxxviii)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[syndic]] is the counsel of a juridical person, a collegiate body or a chapter.&lt;ref&gt;(X, De syndic., I, xxxix)&lt;/ref&gt; The chief duty of the conservators is to represent the rights of the {{lang|la|personae miserabiles}}, i.e. members of orders, the poor, widows, orphans.&lt;ref&gt;(c. xv, in VIto, De off. et pot. jud. deleg., I, xiv)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fiscal promoter]] ({{lang|la|promotor fiscalis}}) is appointed by the ecclesiastical authorities to watch over ecclesiastical discipline,&lt;ref&gt;(Instructio Congr. Ep. et Reg., 11 June 1880, art. xiii)&lt;/ref&gt; consequently in penal cases he appears as public prosecutor. A {{lang|la|defensor matrimonii}}, or [[defender of the matrimonial tie]], assists in suits concerning the invalidity of a marriage.&lt;ref&gt;(Benedict XIV, {{lang|la|"Dei miseratione"}}, 3 November 1741)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his jurisdiction, which can be ordinary, quasi-ordinary or delegated, the ecclesiastical judge must also have certain physical and moral qualities First, he must be an ecclesiastic,&lt;ref&gt;(c. ii, X, De jud., II, i)&lt;/ref&gt; so women and laymen are excluded from the office. Yet the pope could confer the office upon a layman.&lt;ref&gt;({{lang|la|Gloss to "Praesumant"}}, c. ii, X, De jud., II, i)&lt;/ref&gt; It is further necessary to have full use of his senses and understanding, and suitable legal knowledge; the person appointed must also be twenty years old; but eighteen years will suffice for a judge appointed by the pope or if the parties agree to it.&lt;ref&gt;(c. xli, X, De off. jud. deleg., I, xxix)&lt;/ref&gt; The judge must also have a good reputation, must not be [[excommunicated]], suspended from office, or under an [[interdict]]&lt;ref&gt;(c. xxiv, X, De sent. et re jud., II, xxvii)&lt;/ref&gt; Above all he must be impartial; a suspicion of partiality attaches to the judge who is personally interested in a case,&lt;ref&gt;(c. xxxvi, X, De appellat., II, xxviii)&lt;/ref&gt; or is related by blood within the fourth degree to one of the parties, or connected with one by marriage,&lt;ref&gt;(c. xxxvi, cit.)&lt;/ref&gt; or who lives in the same house, or dines at a common table, or is otherwise friendly, or on the other hand inimical, towards one of the parties,&lt;ref&gt;(c. xxv, X, De off. jud. deleg., I, xxix)&lt;/ref&gt; and he may be rejected ({{lang|la|recusari, exceptio judicis suspecti}}) by the accused or by both parties as prejudiced ({{lang|la|suspectus}}) If objection be raised against a judge on the ground of prejudice, which must be done in writing and if possible before the beginning of the action,&lt;ref&gt;(c. xx, X, De sent. et re jud., II, xxvii)&lt;/ref&gt; arbitrators are to pass on the objection;&lt;ref&gt;(c. xxxix, X, De off. jud. deleg., I, xxix)&lt;/ref&gt; if, however, objection be raised against the delegate of the bishop, the decision rests with the bishop.&lt;ref&gt;(c. iv, X, De foro compet., II, ii)&lt;/ref&gt; If the objection be declared well-founded, the judge transfers the case, with the concurrence of the party who brought the accusation, to another or to a higher judge.&lt;ref&gt;(c. lxi, X, De appell., II, xxviii)&lt;/ref&gt; If the judge lacks the necessary qualifications, and this be known to the parties in the suit, the decision is invalid; if, however, his unfitness be unknown to the parties, and he follow statute canon law, the Church supplements the deficiency, even if the judge have acted in bad faith. 

Ecclesiastical jurisdiction is exercised over all baptized persons; yet in order that an ecclesiastical judge may be permitted to exercise {{lang|la|de facto}} his judicial power he must also be competent, i.e. must be authorized to pass judgment on a given person in a given case Proceedings held before a judge without competence are null and void .Those subject to the jurisdiction of a certain judge are said to be within the competence ({{lang|la|competentia}}) of his court, or have their {{lang|la|forum}} in him. The forum is either the free, voluntary choice of the parties ({{lang|la|forum prorogatum}}), or it is defined by law ({{lang|la|forum legale}}), but in criminal and matrimonial cases there is no {{lang|la|forum prorogatum}}.&lt;ref&gt;(c. ix, X, De in integr. restit., I, xli)&lt;/ref&gt; Ecclesiastics can choose another judge only with the permission of the bishop, and in this case he must be an ecclesiastic&lt;ref&gt;(c. xii, xviii, X, De foro compet., II, ii)&lt;/ref&gt; The legal forum ({{lang|la|forum legale}}) is either ordinary, if the proper course of the regular courts is followed, or extraordinary, if for legal reasons a regular court is passed over. Moreover, the {{lang|la|forum legale}} is either general ({{lang|la|commune}}), corresponding to the universally valid law, or special or privileged ({{lang|la|speciale sive privilegiatum}}), resting on privilege, as in the case of ecclesiastics on account of the {{lang|la|[[privilegium fori]]}} which they cannot renounce.
 
As the jurisdiction of a judge is generally limited to a defined locality, the {{lang|la|forum commune}} is fixed by the {{lang|la|domicile}} or {{lang|la|quasi-domicile}} of the accused. The axiom holds: {{lang|la|Actor sequitur forum rei}}, the plaintiff goes to the court of the accused.&lt;ref&gt;({{lang|la|c. v, viii, X, De foro compet., II, ii}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Domicile (law)|Domicile]] is that place where one actually resides with the intention of always remaining there Quasi-domicile is determined by actual residence at the place and the intention to remain there at least the greater part of the year; there is also a domicile by operation of law, legal or fictitious domicile ({{lang|la|domicilium legale sive fictitium}})—thus a wife may be subject to the jurisdiction of the domicile of the husband, children to that of the parents, religious to that of the place where the monastery is situated, persons having [[no fixed abode]] to that of the present place of residence A process can be instituted at [[Rome]] against an ecclesiastic who is only accidentally there.&lt;ref&gt;(c. xx, X, De foro compet., II, ii)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the—usual—{{lang|la|forum domicilii}}, there is also that of the object ({{lang|la|forum rei sitae}}, where the thing is situated), i.e. complaint can be brought before the judge in whose district the controverted object is;&lt;ref&gt;(c. iii, X, De foro compet., II, ii)&lt;/ref&gt; the forum where the contract is made ({{lang|la|forum contractus}}), i.e. the parties can bring action before the judge in whose district the disputed contract has been made;&lt;ref&gt;({{lang|la|c. xcii, X, De foro compet., II, ii}})&lt;/ref&gt; that of the offence ({{lang|la|forum delicti}}), within the jurisdiction where the offence was committed.&lt;ref&gt;({{lang|la|c. xiv, X, De foro compet., II, ii}})&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a forum arising from the connection of matters ({{lang|la|forum connexitatis sive continentiae causarum}}), if the matters in dispute are so interrelated that one cannot be decided without the other;&lt;ref&gt;({{lang|la|c. i, X, De causa possess., II, xii}})&lt;/ref&gt; also the forum of a [[counterplea]] ({{lang|la|forum reconventionis sive reaccusationis}}), i.e. in a criminal suit the defendant can, on his side, accuse the plaintiff in the court of the judge before whom he himself is to be tried.&lt;ref&gt;({{lang|la|c. ii, X, De mut. petit., II, iv}})&lt;/ref&gt; If the judge himself wishes to bring an accusation, the superior appoints the judge who is to hear it.&lt;ref&gt;(c. i, c. xvi, Q. vi)&lt;/ref&gt; The decision of an incompetent judge is valid if by common error ({{lang|la|error communis}}) he is held to be competent In civil disputes the parties can entrust the decision to any desired arbiter.&lt;ref&gt;({{lang|la|X, De transact., I, xxxvi; X, De arbitr., I, xliii}})&lt;/ref&gt; 

If the judge render a defective decision, appeal can be taken to the next higher judge; this relation of the courts to one another and the successive course of appeals ({{lang|la|gradus}}), called succession of instances, follows the order of superiority. From the beginning the [[bishop]], or his representative, the [[archdeacon]], or the "official" ({{lang|la|officialis}}), or the [[vicar-general]], was the judge in first instance for all suits, contentious or criminal, which arose in the diocese or in the corresponding administrative district, so far as such suits were not withdrawn from his jurisdiction by the common law. The court of second instance was originally the [[provincial synod]], later the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]].&lt;ref&gt;[c. iii (Syn. of Nicaea, an. 325, c. v), iv (Syn. of Antioch, an. 341, c. xx), D. XVIII]&lt;/ref&gt; The court of the third instance was that of the [[pope]]. The court of the first instance for bishops was the provincial synod, the metropolitan, the [[exarch]] or the [[patriarch]]; the court of second instance was that of the pope;&lt;ref&gt;[c. xxxvi (Syn. of Sardica, an. 343, c. vii), c. II, Q. vi]&lt;/ref&gt; only the pope could be the judge of first instance for exarchs and patriarchs. Since the [[Middle Ages]] the pope is the judge of first instance in all more important episcopal causes ({{lang|la|causae maiores, graviores, difficiliores, arduae}}), the number and extent of which are in no way exactly definable, but to which above all belong the {{lang|la|causae criminales graviores contra episcopos}}—more serious criminal charges against bishops&lt;ref&gt;({{lang|la|c. i, X, De translat. episc., I, vii}})&lt;/ref&gt; Conformably to this the diocesan bishop or his representative (the vicar-general, or {{lang|la|officialis}}, or some other diocesan authority) became the judge of the court of first instance, so far as common law has not withdrawn from him this jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;(Council of Trent, Sess. XXIV, De ref., c. xx)&lt;/ref&gt; If the see is vacant the [[vicar-capitular]] is judge of the court of first instance. The judge of the second instance is the metropolitan.&lt;ref&gt;(c. lxvi, X, De appell., II, xxviii)&lt;/ref&gt; For archdioceses, as a rule, the judge of second instance is a neighbouring archbishop or bishop appointed by the [[Holy See]].&lt;ref&gt;(Concil. plenar. Baltimor., III, an. 1884, n. 316; Leo XIII, {{lang|la|"Trans Oceanum"}}, 18 April 1897, n. 14)&lt;/ref&gt; The same ordinance also applies to exempt bishoprics.&lt;ref&gt;(Sacr. Congr. pro negot. eccles. extraord., 11 September 1906)&lt;/ref&gt; The court of the third instance is the Apostolic See, but in the {{lang|la|causae maiores}} it is the court of first instance As, however, the pope is the {{lang|la|judex ordinarius omnium}}, the ordinary ecclesiastical judge of all, ecclesiastical suits without exception can be brought or summoned before the {{lang|la|papal forum}} as the court of first instance.&lt;ref&gt;(Council of Trent, Sess. XXIV, De ref., c. xx; Vatic., Sess. III, De eccl., c. iii)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the Middle Ages the lower courts were often evaded, or the popes summoned the suits at one before their forum;&lt;ref&gt;(c. lci, X, De appell., II, xxviii)&lt;/ref&gt; this custom had some advantages on account of the better legal education and greater impartiality of the members of the papal court, but the administration of justice was delayed and, above all, made more costly by the rule enforced in the papal courts that the parties must appear in person. What made the matter still worse was that such summonses to Rome, as to the court of first instance, diminish unduly the authority of the lower courts. To put an end, therefore, to constant complaint on this point, the [[Decretals]]&lt;ref&gt;(q. v.)&lt;/ref&gt; ordained that in future, before the rendering of the sentence, no one could appeal to a higher court without giving a sufficient reason to the judge {{lang|la|a quo}} (from whom the appeal was made), and that the appeal could only be accepted by the judge {{lang|la|ad quem}} (to whom appeal lies) after he had satisfied himself of the validity of the appeal&lt;ref&gt;(c. lvi, X, De appell., II, xxviii)&lt;/ref&gt; Lawsuits, therefore, pending before the Apostolic See were to be tried by a judge belonging to the place whence the appeal came, and especially appointed by the pope.&lt;ref&gt;(c. xxviii, X, De rescript., I, iii; c. xi, in Vito, De rescript., I, iii)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late Middle Ages rulers of countries were frequently granted for their domains the papal {{lang|la|privilegia de non evocando}} (exemption from summons); in some cases, they forbade the appeal to a foreign court. 

Following the precedents of the [[Synod of Constance]]&lt;ref&gt;(Martini V Pap. et Germ. nat. concordata, c. iv, in Hardouin, "Acta. Conc.", VIII, 891)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Synod of Basle]],&lt;ref&gt;(Sess. XXXI, c. i, in Hardouin, "Acta. Conc.", VIII, 1425)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Council of Trent]]&lt;ref&gt;(Sess. XXIV, De ref., c. xx, and Sess. XXV, De ref., c. x)&lt;/ref&gt; decreed: The court of the bishop is the court of first instance Each suit must be brought to a close within at least two years. During this period no appeal is permitted, neither can the higher judge summon the case before his forum; an appeal before the lapse of two years is permissible only if a final sentence has been pronounced.

In case of appeal to the Apostolic See, or if the latter, for good reasons, summons a suit from the beginning before its forum, the suit is to be decided either at Rome or by delegated judges on the spot ({{lang|la|judices in partibus}}). As on account of the remoteness of the place where the dispute arose and the consequent lack of knowledge of local persons, unsuitable judges have been at times appointed at the place where the dispute arose, the bishops are each to select, on occasion of the provincial—or diocesan synod, at least four men ({{lang|la|judices synodales}}) having the qualities designated by [[Boniface VIII]],&lt;ref&gt;(c. xi, in VIto, De rescript., I, iii)&lt;/ref&gt; and present their names to the Apostolic See, which in its selection of judges is to be so limited to the persons thus named that the delegation of any other person is invalid; as provincial and diocesan synods are no longer regularly held, bishops are permitted to make this selection with the advice of the [[diocesan chapter]];&lt;ref&gt;([[Benedict XIV]], {{lang|la|"Quamvis paternae"}}, 26 August 1741)&lt;/ref&gt; consequently, judges so appointed are called {{lang|la|judices prosynodales}}. At present, this also is no longer customary: on the contrary, the Apostolic See appoints its representatives {{lang|la|in partibus}} entirely independently, but it is so arranged that the delegation is bestowed on neighbor bishops and archbishops for a definite term of years. Such delegation is all the more necessary in case a State does not permit ecclesiastical suits to be tried outside of its boundaries, or will only permit the judgement of such a court to be executed within its territories by the secular power.

In [[Thailand]], the [[freedom of religion]] is protected through statutory means. The law provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally has respected this right in practice; however, it does not register new religious groups that have not been accepted into one of the existing religious governing bodies on [[Doctrine|doctrinal]] or other grounds. In practice, unregistered [[religious organization]]s have operated freely, and the government's practice of not recognizing any new religious groups has not restricted the activities of unregistered religious groups. The [[government]] officially limits the number of foreign [[missionaries]] that may work in the country, although unregistered missionaries have been present in large numbers and have been allowed to live and work freely. There have been no reports of societal abuses or [[discrimination]] based on religious belief or practice; however, in the far southern border [[province]]s, continued [[separatist]] violence has resulted in increasingly tense relations between the [[Buddhist]] and [[Muslim]] communities.

==Religious demography==
{{Main|Religion in Thailand}}

The country has an area of {{convert|198000|sqmi|km2}} and population of 70 million. According to the government's [[National Statistical Office of Thailand|National Statistics Office]], approximately 94.8 percent of the population is [[Buddhist]] and 4.5 percent is [[Muslim]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=สรุปผลการสำรวจการเข้าร่วมกิจกรรมทางวัฒนธรรม พ.ศ. 2548|url=http://service.nso.go.th/nso/nsopublish/service/survey/cult48.pdf|date=2005|publisher=National Statistical Office of Thailand|access-date=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, [[non-governmental organization]]s, academics, and religious groups estimated that approximately 85 to 90 percent of the population is [[Theravada Buddhist]] and up to 10 percent of the population is Muslim{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. [[Christianity|Christians]], mainly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]s, represent 0.7% of the population. There are small [[Animism|animist]], [[Confucianism|Confucian]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Sikhism|Sikh]], and [[Taoism|Taoist]] populations. According to the [[Ministry of Culture (Thailand)|Ministry of Culture]]'s Religious Affairs Department (RAD), the numbers of [[atheists]] or persons who do not profess a religious faith make up less than one percent of the population.

The dominant religion is [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]]. The Buddhist clergy, or [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], consists of two main schools, which are governed by the same [[ecclesiastic]]al hierarchy. Monks belonging to the older [[Mahanikaya]] school far outnumber those of the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya|Dhammayuttika]] school, an order that grew out of a 19th-century reform movement led by [[King Mongkut]] (Rama IV).

[[Islam]] is the dominant religion in four of the five southernmost provinces, which border [[Malaysia]]. The majority of Muslims are ethnic [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]], but the Muslim population encompass groups of diverse ethnic and national origin, including descendants of immigrants from [[South Asia]], [[China]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Indonesia]]. The RAD reported that there are 3,567 registered [[mosques]] in 64 provinces, of which 2,289 are located in the 5 southernmost provinces. According to the RAD, 99 percent of these mosques are associated with the [[Sunni]] branch of Islam. [[Shi'a]] mosques make up the remaining 1 percent.

According to RAD statistics, there are an estimated 351,987 [[Christian]]s in the country{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, constituting 0.5 percent of the population. There are several [[Protestant]] denominations, and most belong to one of four umbrella organizations. The oldest of these groupings, the [[Church of Christ in Thailand]], was formed in the mid-1930s. The largest is the [[Evangelical Fellowship of Thailand]]. [[Baptists]] and [[Seventh-day Adventists]] are recognized by authorities as separate Protestant denominations and are organized under similar umbrella groups.

According to the most recent government survey in 2002, there are 9 recognized tribal groups (chao khao), comprising approximately 920,000 persons{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. [[Syncretistic]] practices drawn from Buddhism, Christianity, [[Taoism]], and spirit worship are common among the tribal groups. The Sikh Council of Thailand estimates the Sikh community to have a population of approximately 70,000 persons, most of whom reside in [[Bangkok]], [[Chiang Mai]], [[Nakhon Ratchasima]], [[Pattaya]], [[Ko Samui (city)|Ko Samui]], and [[Phuket Province|Phuket]]. There are 18 [[Sikh]] temples in the country. According to RAD statistics and local Hindu organizations, there are an estimated 95,000 Hindus in the country.

The ethnic [[Chinese people|Chinese]] minority (Sino-Thai) has retained some popular religious traditions from China, including adherence to popular Taoist beliefs. Members of the [[Yao people|Mien]] [[Hill tribe (Thailand)|hill tribe]] follow a form of Taoism.

[[Mahayana]] Buddhism is practiced primarily by small groups of Chinese and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] immigrants. There are more than 675 Chinese and Vietnamese Mahayana Buddhist shrines and temples throughout the country.

Religious groups [[Proselytism|proselytize]] freely. Monks working as Buddhist missionaries (Dhammaduta) have been active since the end of [[World War II]], particularly in border areas among the country's tribal populations. According to the National Buddhism Bureau, as of December 2006 there are 6,458 Dhammaduta working in the country. In addition, the government sponsored the international travel of another 1,414 Buddhist monks sent by their temples to disseminate religious information. Muslim organizations reported having small numbers of citizens working as missionaries in the country and abroad. Christian organizations reported much larger numbers of missionaries, both foreign and [[Thai people|Thai]], operating in the country.

==Status of religious freedom==

===Legal and policy framework===
{{seealso|Chularatchamontri}}
The law provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respected this right in practice; however, it restricted the activities of some groups. On September 19, 2006, in a bloodless [[2006 Thai coup d'état|coup d'état]], the military overthrew the government and repealed the [[Constitution of Thailand|constitution]]. On October 1, 2006, the military coup leaders [[Promulgation|promulgated]] an interim constitution, established an interim government, and convened a Constitutional Drafting Assembly to draft a new constitution. Legal experts maintained that the interim constitution incorporates by reference many of the civil rights and protections contained in the 1997 constitution. The repealed 1997 constitution required that the [[monarch]] be a Buddhist. This provision was retained in the April 2007 first draft of the country's next constitution. The state religion in effect is Theravada Buddhism; however, it is not officially designated as such. During the reporting period, some Buddhist organizations called for the designation of Buddhism as the state religion in the new draft constitution, but as of June 2007 such a provision had not been included.

The [[repeal]]ed 1997 constitution stated that discrimination against a person on the grounds of "a difference in religious belief" shall not be permitted. The September 2006 interim constitution appears to retain by reference this prohibition against discrimination, and it has been included explicitly in the April 2007 draft constitution. There was no significant pattern of religious discrimination during the period covered by this report.

The repealed 1997 constitution and the interim constitution by reference provided for a large measure of freedom of speech; however, laws prohibiting speech likely to insult Buddhism remain in place. The 1962 Sangha Act specifically prohibits the [[defamation]] or insult of Buddhism and the Buddhist clergy. Violators of the law could face up to 1 year [[imprisonment]] or fines of up to $5,800 (188,000 [[Thai baht|baht]]). The [[Criminal code|Penal Code]] prohibits the insult or disturbance of religious places or services of all officially recognized religions.

The government plays an active role in religious affairs. The RAD, which is subordinate to the [[Ministry of Culture (Thailand)|Ministry of Culture]], registers religious organizations. Under the provisions of the Religious Organizations Act, the RAD recognizes a new religion if a national [[census]] shows that it has at least 5,000 adherents, has a uniquely recognizable [[theology]], and is not politically active. A religious organization must be accepted into an officially recognized ecclesiastical group before the RAD will grant registration. During the reporting period, there were five recognized religious groups: [[Buddhist]]s, [[Muslim]]s, [[Brahmin]]-[[Hindu]]s, [[Sikh]]s, and [[Catholic]]s. Four Protestant groups are recognized as subgroups of the Catholics. Government registration confers some benefits, including access to state subsidies, [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] status, and preferential allocation of resident [[Visa (document)|visas]] for organization officials. However, since 1984 the government has not recognized any new religious groups. In practice, unregistered religious organizations operated freely, and the government's practice of not recognizing any new religious groups did not restrict the activities of unregistered religious groups.

The repealed 1997 constitution required the government "to patronize and protect Buddhism and other religions." The September 2006 interim constitution appears to retain by reference this protection for religion, and it has been included explicitly in the April 2007 draft constitution. The state subsidizes activities of the three largest religious [[Community|communities]] (Buddhist, Islamic, and Christian). The government allocated approximately $92.6 million (3 billion baht) during fiscal year 2007 to support the National Buddhism Bureau, which was established in 2002 as an independent state agency. The office oversees the Buddhist clergy and approved the [[Curriculum|curricula]] of Buddhist teachings for all Buddhist temples of educational institutions. In addition, the bureau promotes the Buddhist faith by sponsoring educational and public relations materials on the faith and practice in daily life.

For fiscal year 2006 the government, through the RAD, budgeted $950,000 (30.8 million baht) for Islamic organizations and $88,000 (2.85 million baht) for Christian, Brahman-Hindu, and Sikh organizations.

The [[budget]]s for Buddhist and Muslim organizations included funds to support Buddhist and Muslim institutes of [[higher education]], fund religious education programs in public and private schools, provide daily [[Allowance (money)|allowance]]s for monks and Muslim clerics who hold administrative and senior ecclesiastical posts, and [[Subsidy|subsidize]] travel and health care for monks and Muslim clerics. Also included is an annual budget for the renovation and repair of Buddhist temples and Muslim mosques, the maintenance of historic Buddhist sites, and the daily upkeep of the central mosque in [[Pattani, Thailand]]. Other registered religious groups can request government support for renovation and repair work but do not receive a regular budget to maintain religious buildings, nor do they receive government assistance to support their clergy. In 2007 the government budgeted approximately $580,000 (18.8 million baht) for the restoration of religious buildings of religious groups, of which $362,000 (11.7 million baht) was allotted for the Muslim community, $145,000 (4.7 million baht) for the Christian, Brahmin-Hindu, and Sikh communities, and $73,000 (2.4 million baht) for special projects of all communities. Private donations to registered religious organizations are [[Tax deduction|tax deductible]].

Religious instruction is required in public schools at both the primary and secondary education levels. The Ministry of Education has formulated a course called "Social, Religion, and Culture Studies," which students in each grade study for one to two hours each week. The course contains information about all of the recognized religions in the country. Students who wish to pursue in-depth studies of other religions or of their belief may study at the religious schools and can transfer credits to the public school. Schools, working in conjunction with their local school administrative board, are authorized to arrange additional religious studies courses. The [[Sangha Supreme Council]] and the Central Islamic Committee of Thailand have created special curricula for Buddhist and Islamic studies.

There are a variety of Islamic education opportunities for children. Tadika is an after-school religious course for children in grades one through six, which is under the supervision of the RAD, except for the three southern provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, and Pattani, where the courses were supervised by the Ministry of Education. The education generally takes place in a mosque. According to government statistics, as of April 2007 there were 1,618 registered Islamic Religious and Moral Education centers teaching Tadika in the 3 southern provinces, with 170,989 students and 5,749 teachers. In the remainder of the country, the RAD registered 994 centers, with 110,783 students and 2,693 teachers. For secondary school children, the Ministry of Education allows two separate curricula for private Islamic studies schools. The first type teaches only Islamic religious courses. As of April 2007 there were 107 schools with 2,044 students and 277 teachers using this curriculum in the 3 southern provinces. The Government registers but does not certify these schools, and students from these schools cannot continue to any higher education within the country. The number of this type of school declined because students opted to attend schools that afford alternatives for higher education. The second curriculum teaches both Islamic religious courses and traditional state education coursework. As of April 2007, 144 schools with 72,618 students used this curriculum in the 3 southern provinces. The government recognizes these private schools, and graduating students can continue to higher education within the country. A third type of Islamic education available, mostly in the southern part of the country, is that provided by traditional, privately operated religious day schools, known as pondok schools. As of April 2007, there were 328 registered pondok schools primarily in Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat Provinces. Previously, these religious schools were not required to register with the Government and received no government oversight or funding. The registration effort began in April 2004 following an attack on a military post and arms depot in Narathiwat in January 2004. Government investigations into that incident led the authorities to pursue suspects associated with pondok schools. The total number of pondoks is still unknown. Sources believed that there could be as many as 1,000.

The government actively sponsors interfaith dialogue. The abrogated 1997 constitution required the state to "promote good understanding and harmony among followers of all religions." This language was included in the April 2007 draft constitution. The government funds regular meetings and public education programs. These programs included the RAD annual interfaith meeting for representatives and members of all religious groups certified by RAD. The programs also included monthly meetings of the 17 member Subcommittee on Religious Relations, located within the Prime Minister's National Identity Promotion Office (the subcommittee is composed of one representative from the Buddhist, Muslim, Roman Catholic, Hindu, and Sikh communities in addition to civil servants from several government agencies). The RAD held an interfaith event focusing on religious youth from June 26–28 in Chonburi Province, just outside Bangkok. Approximately 250 youth from across the country attended. In July 2006 the RAD organized another interfaith convention in Surat Thani, which had approximately 1,000 participants. The RAD sponsored a public relations campaign promoting interreligious understanding and harmony, including prime-time television announcements. However, a continuing separatist insurgency by militant ethnic Malay Muslims in the southernmost provinces led to concerns that the violence may be contributing to increased tensions between the local Buddhist and Muslim communities.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
During the reporting period, the [[Falun Gong]] abandoned a petition challenging the government's September 2005 denial of their application to register as an association with the Office of the National Cultural Commission. The petition was abandoned after no action had been announced on a second petition submitted to the police department to print and distribute a weekly Falun Gong magazine. The group was able to print and distribute religious materials both in Thai and Chinese on a small, informal basis for free distribution. Falun Gong maintained a website that advertises daily gatherings in Bangkok.

The government does not recognize religious groups other than the five existing groupings; however, unregistered religious organizations operated freely.

Although unregistered missionaries were present in large numbers, the number of foreign missionaries registered with the government is limited to a quota that originally was established by the RAD in 1982. The quota is divided along both religious and denominational lines. There were close to 1,500 registered foreign missionaries in the country, most of them Christian. During the period covered by this report, the government increased by 10 slots its quota for Christian missionaries. In addition to these formal quotas, far more missionaries, while not registered, were able to live and work in the country without government interference. While registration conferred some benefits, such as longer terms for visa stays, being unregistered was not a significant barrier to foreign missionary activity. Many foreign missionaries entered the country using tourist visas and proselytized or disseminated religious literature without the acknowledgment of the RAD. There were no reports that foreign missionaries were deported or harassed for working without registration. Muslim professors and clerics, particularly in the far south, continue to face additional scrutiny because of continued government concern about the resurgence of Muslim separatist activities; however, this did not appear to interfere with their activities or their ability to practice their faith.

Muslim female civil servants were not permitted to wear headscarves when dressed in civil servant uniforms; however, in practice most female civil servants were permitted by their superiors to wear headscarves if they wished, particularly in the country's southernmost provinces. Muslim female civil servants not required to wear uniforms were allowed to wear headscarves.

===Abuses of religious freedom===
There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country. However, in many Thai schools Buddhism praying is a compulsory activity along with paying respect to [[Thai Flag]], but the student of other religions can freely choose not to perform Buddhism praying (for example, Muslim student are not forced to pray the Buddhism ritual) .

===Forced religious conversion===
There were no reports of forced religious conversions, including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice; however, religious groups closely associated with ethnic minorities, such as Muslims, experienced some societal [[economic discrimination]]. Such discrimination appeared to be linked more to ethnicity than to religion. Continued violence in the far southern regions of the country contributed to negative stereotypes of Muslims held by persons from other geographic areas of the country. Killings clearly targeted at Buddhists increased ethnic tensions between Muslim and Buddhist communities in the far south.

Violent acts committed by suspected separatist militants in the Muslim-majority provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, Songkhla, and Yala affected the ability of some Buddhists in this predominantly Muslim region to undertake the full range of their traditional religious practices. During the reporting period, 13 suspects were arrested and were in the process of being tried for the deaths of a Buddhist monk and two novices in an October 2005 attack on a Buddhist temple in Pattani Province.

There were almost daily attacks by suspected separatist militants in the country's southernmost provinces on both government officials and Buddhists and Muslim civilians. On March 14, 2007, assailants ambushed a van in Yala Province killing eight Buddhist passengers including two teenage girls. That evening, 2 bombs exploded outside a nearby mosque and teashop, killing 3 Muslims and injuring 20. On March 19, 2007, gunmen killed three Muslim students and injured seven others at an Islamic boarding school in Songkhla Province. The violence contributed to an atmosphere of fear and suspicion in the southern provinces. As a result of a series of increasingly provocative attacks, the level of tension between the local Muslim and Buddhist communities continued to grow. Government officials and observers expressed concern that the violence could result in open communal conflict.

On October 11, 2006, a monk was injured by a bomb in Narathiwat Province. Three others were injured in a separate incident on October 23. The monks were performing the morning ritual of receiving donations of food and were guarded by three armed soldiers, one of whom subsequently died from the explosion.

At the end of the reporting period, no one had been arrested for the 2004 killing of three Buddhist monks and the beheading of one civilian Buddhist rubber tapper, or for the 2004 attacks on Buddhist temples and one Chinese shrine in the southern provinces of the country. The Government continued to investigate these incidents in the context of security operations involving the ongoing separatist violence in the South. Buddhist monks continued to report that they were fearful and thus no longer able to travel freely through southern communities to receive alms. They also claimed that laypersons sometimes declined to assist them in their daily activities out of fear of being targeted by militants. In response to the killings, the Government stationed troops to protect the religious practitioners and structures of all faiths in communities where the potential for violence existed and provided armed escort for Buddhist monks, where necessary, for their daily rounds to receive alms.

[[File:Gaap.jpg|thumb|Gaap, by [[Louis Le Breton]], 1863]]
'''Gaap''' (also ''Tap'', ''Coap'', ''Taob'', ''Goap'') is a [[Goetia|goetic]] [[demon]] described in [[the Lesser Key of Solomon]],&lt;ref&gt;Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis: The Lesser Key of Solomon, Detailing the Ceremonial Art of Commanding Spirits Both Good and Evil; ed. Joseph H. Peterson; Weiser Books, Maine; 2001. p.18-22&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]],&lt;ref&gt;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (Liber officiorum spirituum); Johann Weyer, ed. Joseph Peterson; 2000. Available online at [http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/weyer.htm Esoteric Archives] [http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/weyer.htm#par30 par 30-39]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Dictionnaire Infernal]],&lt;ref&gt;Dictionnaire infernal: ou Répertoire universel des êtres, des personnages, Jacques Collin de Plancy, 1853, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ng8JAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=intitle%3ADictionnaire%20intitle%3AInfernal&amp;lr&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=1&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false available on Google Books]. p.460-469&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Munich Manual of Demonic Magic]],&lt;ref&gt;Forbidden Rites: A Necromancer's Manual of the Fifteenth Century; Richard Kieckhefer; Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, PA; 1997. P. 165-167 and 291-293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Goetia of Dr Rudd; Thomas Rudd, Ed. Stephen Skinner &amp; David Rankine; 2007, Golden Hoard Press. p.34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction by Joseph Peterson to Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (Liber officiorum spirituum); Johann Weyer, ed. Joseph Peterson; 2000. Available online at [http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/weyer.htm Esoteric Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; as a Prince in human form who incites love. The Munich Manual also says that Taob also provides medical care for women, transforms them to make it easier to get to a lover, renders them infertile, and rules twenty-five legions of spirits.  The sources besides the Munich Manual also describe Gaap as a President, giving him the powers to teach philosophy and liberal arts, make others invisible, steal familiars from other magicians, make men stupid, and carry men between kingdoms; in addition to ruling sixty-six legions of demons.  [[Johann Weyer]] also connects Gaap to [[Necromancy|necromancers]], and states that he was first called upon by [[Ham_(son_of_Noah)|Noah's son Ham]], along with [[Beleth]].  He was of the order of [[Christian_angelic_hierarchy#Powers_or_Authorities|''potestates'']].

Gaap (or ''Goap'') is also one of the four cardinal spirits, of the south in the Lesser Key of Solomon, the west in the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum.

In the [[Livre des Esperitz]],&lt;ref name="LDECoap"&gt;"Les who's who démonologiques de la Renaissance et leurs ancêtres médiévaux" by Jean-Patrice Boudet, Médiévales 44, Spring 2003, [http://medievales.revues.org/1019 (online link)]. pars. 25, 28, 56&lt;/ref&gt; Gaap (as ''Caap'') is still a Prince, but appears as a knight, brings gold and silver anywhere, and rules twenty legions of spirits.

Practicing occultist Carroll "Poke" Runyon treats Gaap and Coap as different entities,&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Solomon's Magick'' by Carroll Runyon, C.H.S. Inc, 1996, p.160&lt;/ref&gt; although they were historically the same figure.&lt;ref name="LDECoap" /&gt;

According to [[Thomas Rudd]], Gaap is opposed by the [[Shemhamphorasch]] angel Ieuiah.&lt;ref&gt;Rudd, ed. Skinner &amp; Rankine, p.366-376&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation''' is a [[Gilding|gilt]]-[[bronze]] statue of [[Maitreya]] seated in meditation and is one of the best known and most highly regarded [[Korean Buddhist sculpture]]s.&lt;ref name="MET"&gt;Judith Smith, ''Arts of Korea''. (1998) p. 137–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Now part of the collection of the [[National Museum of Korea]], it was designated as the 78th [[National treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]].&lt;ref name="CHA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.cha.go.kr/chaen/search/selectGeneralSearchDetail.do?sCcebKdcd=11&amp;ccebAsno=00780000&amp;sCcebCtcd=11 |title=Heritage Search - National Treasure 78 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Cultural Heritage Administration |access-date=2018-01-22 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue is 83.2&amp;nbsp;centimeters in height.  It was cast from bronze and gilded, probably in the middle or late 6th century.  The bronze is less than one centimeter in thickness (and as thin as 2 mm&lt;ref name="NMK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.go.kr/site/eng/relic/search/view?relicId=4358 |title=Collection Database - Pensive Bodhisattva |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=National Museum of Korea |access-date=2018-01-22 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which attests to the skills of bronze-workers during this time period.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;

In 1912 a Japanese person acquired it, and donated it to the General Governing Department of Japan over [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]]. Since 1916 it has been housed at the [[National Museum of Korea]].&lt;ref name="CHA"/&gt;

The maitreya is semi-seated on a stool with its right leg crossed over the left in deep meditation.  The face of the statue, has a hint of a smile, and exhibits a sense of serene concentration.  The right arm of the statue, at the elbow, rests on its lap while its delicate hand reaches towards its cheek giving the impression of deep thought.  One shoulder of the maitreya is slightly higher than the other and the upper body is slightly bent forward which also creates the impresses on the viewer an aura of deep thought.  The statue wears a crown which is rather elaborate with many prongs and parts of the crown rest on the shoulders of the maitreya.  The statue is also dressed in a complicated scarf-like vestment that curves around the body with wing-like projections.  The left foot rests on a base which is shaped like a lotus flower.  The statue is probably of [[Silla]] provenance because of the style is more formalized than realistic.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHA"/&gt;

At one point, the statue had a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], but only traces of it remain. It was designated as the 78th [[National treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]] on December 12, 1962. An X-ray analysis in 1963 showed that "it has no trace of defect or repair either inside or out, and that it was made of a rare material using unique techniques.".&lt;ref name="CHA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6318">{{Shintoism}}

'''Harae''' or '''harai''' (祓 or 祓い) is the general term for [[ritual]]s of [[Ritual purification|purification]] in [[Shinto]]. Harae is one of four essential elements involved in a Shinto ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;(Ben Yari, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose is the purification of pollution or sins ([[tsumi]]) and uncleanness ([[kegare]]).&lt;ref name="Norbeck"&gt;(Norbeck, 1952)&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts include bad luck and disease as well as [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] in the English sense. 

''Harae'' is often described as purification, but it is also known as an [[exorcism]] to be done before worship.&lt;ref name="Norbeck"/&gt;  ''Harae'' often involves symbolic washing with water, or having a Shinto priest shake a large paper shaker called [[ōnusa]] or ''haraegushi'' over the object of purification. People, places, and objects can all be the object of harae.

==History ==

[[Image:Shinto Onusa.jpeg|thumb|200 px|left|An [[ōnusa]], which is used in certain types of harae.]]
''Harae'' stems from the myth of [[Susano-o]], the brother of the Sun goddess [[Amaterasu]]. According to the myth, while Amaterasu was supervising the weaving of the garments of [[Shinto gods|the gods]] in the pure weaving hall, Susano-o broke through the roof and let fall a heavenly horse which had been flayed. This startled one of her attendants who, in her agitation, accidentally killed herself with the loom's shuttle. Amaterasu fled to the heavenly cave [[Amano-Iwato]]. Susano-o was subsequently expelled from heaven and Amaterasu’s sovereignty resumed. The traditional Shinto purification ritual ''harae'' is represented when Susano-o is removed from heaven.&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==

There are various ways in which ''harae'' is practiced. In [[Ise Grand Shrine|Ise]], “the holiest of all Shinto shrines”,&lt;ref&gt;(Chamberlain, 1893)&lt;/ref&gt; wooden charms named ''o-harai'', another name for ''harae'' or ''harai'', are hung all over the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;(Chamberlain)&lt;/ref&gt;

In all Shinto religious ceremonies, ''harae'' is performed in the beginning of the ritual to cleanse any evil, pollution or sins away before anyone gives offerings to the ''[[kami]]''. Often, water and salt are used for the ceremonies to rinse hands and the face, as well as the shrine before it is prepared with offerings of goods and food.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd &amp; Williams, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the priest, along with the rest of the participants of the ritual chant a solemn [[liturgy]] before the assistant priest purifies the offerings using a wand called '''haraigushi'''.&lt;ref name="Boyd-Williams"&gt;(Boyd &amp; Williams, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another method used to perform harae is ''[[misogi]]'', in which a participant stands under a cold waterfall while chanting a liturgy. ''Misogi'' is said to be done on the 11th day of the month, including the winter months at the [[Tsubaki Grand Shrine]].&lt;ref name="Boyd-Williams"/&gt; As both are related they are collectively referred to as {{Nihongo|Misogiharae|禊祓}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1483|title=Misogi|work=Encyclopedia of Shinto|publisher=Kokugakuin University|author=Nishioka Kazuhiko|date=March 31, 2007|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oharae'' is another method performed as a cleansing ritual to cleanse a large group of people. This ritual is practiced mostly in June and December to purify the nation, as well as after a disaster occurs. The practice is also performed at the year-end festival and also before major national festivals.&lt;ref name="Terms"&gt;(“Basic Terms of Shinto”, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Shubatsu'', a cleansing ritual performed by sprinkling salt, is another practice of the Shinto religion. Salt is used as a purifier by placing small piles in front of restaurants, known as {{Nihongo||盛り塩|morijio|pile of salt}} or {{Nihongo||塩花|shiobana|salt flowers}}, for the two-fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japanesereligions.blogspot.com/2009/03/can-you-pass-salt-please.html Can you pass the salt, please?], Robert Camara, March 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, sprinkling salt over a person after attending a funeral is also practiced commonly in the Shinto religion. Another example of this cleansing ritual is to sprinkle water at the gate of one’s home, both in the morning and evening.&lt;ref name="Terms"/&gt;  A significant and visible form of this ritual is when [[sumo]] wrestlers sprinkle salt around the fighting ring before a match, to purify the area.&lt;ref&gt;(“Harae—purification rites”, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hindu and Buddhist architectural heritage of Pakistan''' is part of a long history of settlement and civilization in [[Pakistan]]. The [[Indus Valley civilization]] collapsed in the middle of the second millennium BCE and was followed by the [[Vedic Civilisation]], which extended over much of northern India and Pakistan.

==Vedic period==
The time period in the [[history of India]] known as the '''Vedic period''' or '''Vedic age''' is the period of the composition of the sacred texts called [[Vedas]] and other such texts in [[Vedic Sanskrit]]. The associated culture sometimes referred to as '''Vedic civilization''' was centred on the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] (modern day [[Pakistan]] and [[India]]) and the [[Gangetic plain]] (modern [[India]]). Scholarship places the Vedic period into the 2nd and 1st millennia BCE, continuing up to the 6th century BCE when  it began to be transformed into classical forms of [[Hinduism]]. Early medieval [[Hindu]] authors suggest dates as early as the 4th millennium BCE.

Its early phase saw the formation of various [[kingdoms of Ancient India|kingdoms of ancient India]]. In its late phase (from c. 700 BCE), it saw the rise of the [[Mahajanapadas]], and was succeeded by the golden age of Hinduism and classical [[Sanskrit literature]], the [[Maurya Empire]] (from c. 320 BCE) and the [[Middle kingdoms of India]].

==Gandhāra==
[[File:Ancient india.png|right|350px]]
'''Gandhāra''' (Sanskrit गन्धार, Persian '''Gandara''', '''Waihind''') ([[Urdu]]: '''گندھارا''') is the name of an ancient [[Mahajanapada]], in northern [[Pakistan]] (the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] and parts of northern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and [[Kashmir]]) and eastern [[Afghanistan]]. Gandhara was located mainly in the vale of [[Peshawar]], the [[Potohar]] plateau (see [[Taxila]]) and on the northern side of the [[Kabul River]]. Its main cities were [[Peshawar]] and [[Taxila]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929225502/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9035986/Gandhara]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdom of Gandhara lasted from the 6th century BCE to the 11th century CE. It attained its height from the 1st century to the 5th century under the Buddhist [[Kushan]] Emperors. After it was conquered by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] in 1021, the name Gandhara disappeared. During the Muslim period the area was administered from [[Lahore]] or from [[Kabul]]. During Mughal time the area was part of Kabul province.

==Punjab==
The Punjabis were predominantly [[Buddhists]] like the rest of South Asia, when [[Umayyad]] [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] army led by [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] attacked Sindh and lower  Punjab, in 713. This started the process of Islamic conversion among the population of Punjab, as well as India. This process continued for the next 10 centuries but there were significant non-Muslim populations including Hindus and later Sikhs:
*[[Pothohar Plateau]]
*[[Sagala]]
*[[Sialkot]]
*[[Ganeriwala]]
*[[Tulamba]]
*[[Dipalpur]]
*[[Okara District]]
*[[Mankiala]]

==The heritage of Saraikistan==

===Bhutta Wahan===
Is situated at a distance of 16 kilometres to the North of [[Rahim Yar Khan]], on the lost river [[Hakra]]. The village is said to be named after the name of [[Raja]] [[Bhutta]] who captured this locality after [[Raja Dahir]]. This village is also claimed to be the birthplace of [[Sassi]], the renowned heroine of Sassi-[[Pannun]] and of [[Ab-ul-Fazal]] and [[Fiazi]], sons of [[Mullah Mubarik]].

===Islamgarh Fort===
[[Islamgarh]], the old [[Bhinwar]] Fort, was built by [[Rawal Bhim Singh]] in [[Sambat, Pakistan|Sambat]] in 1665, as the following inscription on its gate in [[Babri]] characters proves "Samabat 1665 [[Asuj]] Wadi 2, [[Maharaj]] Rawal Sri Bhim Singh Ji Maharaj". The fort is situated in the [[Cholistan]] area of Tehsil [[Khanpur]]. It is 46 kilometres south east of [[Baghla, Pakistan|Baghla]] Fort. The fort is in a dilapidated state.

===Mau Bubarik Fort===
According to Tarikh-e-Murad, a fort was built by Raj Hans Karar in Mau Mubarik as a residence for his mother, hence the name Mau refers to mother in local language. The fort was taken by Shah Arghun in 1525. It was one of the six fortresses of Raj Sahasi 11. It had 20 bastions and Towers. The ramparts were about 549 meters in circumference and the walls very strongly and thickly built. Here, the shrine of a Saint Sheikh Hakim is of great importance.

===Pattan Minara===
The ruins of Pattan Minara are located at a distance of about 8 kilometers in east south of Rahim Yar Khan city. It has variously been described as the remains of [[Mauryan period]], who built it in 250 BCE or a Buddhist monastery. Nearby the minar, remains of a fort, a mosque and some tunnels are also visible. About 110 years ago, Colonel Minchin a political agent of Ex-Bahawalpur state, started the excavation of these tunnels but discontinued digging for some reasons or other. According to Colonel Toy, it was the capital of the Hindu state in 10 CE. In the mid of the 18th century, Fazal Elahi Khan Halani, a Daupauta chief, destroyed it and used its materials in the construction of Bhagla and Dingarh Fort.

==Mianwali==
The ruins of Kafirkot, ruins at Mari, remains of Rokhri, architectural objects and remain-ruins of Sirkapp Fort.

The '''history of the Jews in Affaltrach''' in [[Obersulm]], [[Germany]] reaches back to the 17th century and ended during [[The Holocaust]] in the 20th century.

Affaltrach is a village in South West [[Germany]], incorporated to the [[Obersulm]] municipality, which is located about 50&amp;nbsp;km north east of [[Stuttgart]]. The village Jewish synagogue and cemetery are the last remnants of the now abandoned Affaltrach Jewish community.

==History==

===Before the 19th century===
Jews began to settle in Affaltrach in 1660, under the protection of the ruling [[Knights Hospitaller]] order.&lt;ref name="alemannia-judaica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/affaltrach_synagoge.htm#Affaltrach|title=Die Synagoge in Affaltrach (Gemeinde Obersulm, Landkreis Heilbronn)|publisher=alemannia-judaica.de|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1683, three or four Jewish families were living in Affaltrach. By 1749, the Jewish community of Affaltrach reached to about 17 families, dealing mainly with trading cattle, money and goods.&lt;ref name="alemannia-judaica2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/affaltrach_synagoge.htm|title=Die Synagoge in Affaltrach (Gemeinde Obersulm, Landkreis Heilbronn)|publisher=alemannia-judaica.de|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Jewish cemetery was established in 1706 and can still be visited today.

===19th century===
[[File:Obersulm Affaltrach Synagoge 20061126.jpg|thumb|Affaltrach synagoge in 2006]]
During the 19th century, the Jewish community of Affaltrach was bigger than at any other time: In 1807 - 110 Jews (about 11% of total population), 1843 - 164, 1858 - 219. Due to emigration to bigger cities and other reasons, during the second half of the 19th century the community started to minimize to 151 in 1869, 79 in 1886 and 28 in 1910 (3.75% of the total population).&lt;ref name="alemannia-judaica"/&gt;

In 1861, a district report "[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Beschreibung_des_Oberamts_Weinsberg Beschreibung des Oberamts Weinsberg]", was written in [[Stuttgart]] by F.L.I Dillenius, depicting the geographical, demographic and economical conditions of the weinsberg district („Oberamt Weinsberg“), an administrative area operated between 1755 and 1926, that Affaltrach was part of.&lt;ref name="wikisource"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Beschreibung_des_Oberamts_Weinsberg/Kapitel_B_2|title=Beschreibung des Oberamts Weinsberg/Kapitel B 2 – Wikisource|publisher=de.wikisource.org|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report stated that Affaltrach had 990 inhabitants in 1861, among them 219 Jews. It is also stated that in 1856, 41 children learned in the Jewish school. In addition, trade was mostly mediated by Jews.&lt;ref name="wikisource"/&gt;

===20th century===
After the beginning of the industrialisation and with the 19th century liberal Jew legislation, Jews from rural areas settled to the bigger cities. That's why the
Jewish population of Affaltrach was decreasing, so there were only about 21 people left in 1921.&lt;ref name="alemannia-judaica2"/&gt; During [[World War I]], three Jews from Affaltrach who were drafted to the German military died in service, and were buried at the local Jewish cemetery.&lt;ref name="bh.org.il"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Affaltrach |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/affaltrach |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of the Jewish soldiers were erased from the town's war memorial during the Nazi Period.&lt;ref name="bh.org.il" /&gt; A memorial in their honor was also erected in the Jewish cemetery, which is still there today.&lt;ref name="bh.org.il" /&gt; In the wake of [[World War II]], the town Jews were denied access to their shops, and they were eventually deported out of town between 1941 and 1943.&lt;ref name="alemannia-judaica2"/&gt; The town economy was largely depended on Jewish businesses. Two of the three local grocery stores were owned by Jews, in addition to two butchers, a baker and a clothier.

As shown by the documentation of the Jewish victims of the Nazi regime, most Jews living in Affaltrach in the 20th century were older than 40 years old.

===Synagogue===

The Jewish community of Affaltrach established a synagogue in 1701.&lt;ref name="alemannia-judaica.de"&gt;http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/affaltrach_synagoge.htm#Zur Geschichte des Betsaales / der Synagoge&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 18th century, the synagogue was shared with the Jewish community of nearby [[Eschenau]]. Between 1820 and 1824 the synagogue was expanded and a women gallery was added to it, in the cost of about 700 florins.&lt;ref name="alemannia-judaica.de"/&gt; In 1851, a newer synagogue replaced the old one. In addition to the synagogue itself, the building hosted also a teaching room, a teacher's apartment and a [[Mikveh]].

During 1938 ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' the synagogue was devastated and used as a storeroom and refugee shelter. Nowadays, the syangogue is used as a museum for the Jewish community of Affaltrach and maintained by an association specifically dealing with the building. The museum collection shows a few ritual objects, posters and pictures depicting the history of Jews in the [[Heilbronn]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=WDnbzk4-BmkC |page=34 |title=Traveler's Guide to Jewish Germany }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish cemetery===
[[File:Affaltrachjudenfriedhof-04.JPG|thumb|Jewish cemetery Affaltrach]]
The Affaltrach Jewish cemetery is located to the north of the village itself.&lt;ref name="iajgsjewishcemeteryproject"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org/baden-wuerttemberg-baden-wuerttemberg/obersulm.html|title=OBERSULM: Talheim,Sontheim, Horkheim, Öhringen, Eschenau, Lehrensteinsfeld, Affaltrach, Eichelberg, Eschenau, Sülzbach, Weiler, and Willsbach &amp;#124; baden-wuerttemberg-baden-wuerttemberg - International Jewish Cemetery Project|publisher=iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest gravestone seen today is dated to 1677.&lt;ref name="alemannia-judaica3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/affaltrach_friedhof.htm|title=Juedischer Friedhof in Affaltrach (Gemeinde Obersulm, Kreis Heilbronn)|publisher=alemannia-judaica.de|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery served not only Affaltrach but also the nearby villages of Sontheim, Talheim and Horkheim. The cemetery hall and the memorial for the fallen Jewish soldiers who served in the German army during [[World War I]] still exist in the cemetery ground. Estimations suggest that the cemetery has around 700 graves, the last one dated to August 1942.&lt;ref name="alemannia-judaica3"/&gt;

[[File:Affaltrachjudenfriedhof-01x.jpg|thumb|upright|World War I memorial at Jewish cemetery Affaltrach]]
Nowadays, the key to the synagogue is kept at the Protestant Rectory in Affaltrach.&lt;ref name="alemannia-judaica4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/images/Images%20255/Affaltrach%20Friedhof%20370.jpg|title=images/Images%20255/Affaltrach%20Friedhof%20370|publisher=alemannia-judaica.de|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation, pictures and details of all gravestones can be reached through the [http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/images/Images%20258/Friedhof_Obersulm_Affaltrach_Beerdigungsbuch.pdf burial book of the Affaltrach cemetery].

==Notable residents==
[[File:Bertha Thalheimer.jpg|thumb|upright|Bertha Thalheimer]]
Two of the most notable residents of Affaltrach were [[August Thalheimer]] and his sister [[Bertha Thalheimer|Bertha]], both were born in Affaltrach and had family there. August and Bertha were Communist activists during the first half of the 20th century. Bertha and August were first members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and then were among the founders of the [[Spartacus League]]. Later on, while August became the main theorist of the [[Spartacus League]] and published several [http://communist%20essays%20http://www.marxists.org/archive/thalheimer/index.htm essays on Communism], he exiled to [[France]] and eventually to [[Cuba]], where he died in 1948. Bertha stayed in [[Germany]] and served two years in prison since October 1917 due to her part in Anti-war demonstrations. During [[World War II]] she was deported to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] in 1943 until she was released in 1945. She died in [[Stuttgart]] in 1959.

==Reports==
During the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, some reports about the Jewish community of Affaltrach were published and still exist today.

===Anti-Semitic incident in 1899===
In February 1899, an article describing an anti-Semitic incident in Affaltrach was published in ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums]]''. Apparently, a few young men attacked a few Jewish shop owners in Affaltrach, causing them slight injuries and insulting [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name="alemannia-judaica5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/images/Images%20120A/Affaltrach%20AZJ%2024021899.jpg|title=images/Images%20120A/Affaltrach%20AZJ%2024021899|publisher=alemannia-judaica.de|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were given trials and were sentenced to about 14 days of prison and a fine, though some irregularities were found in the process of the trial, according to the article itself.

===Newspaper articles===
Some Jewish newspapers dating to the first decades of the 20th centuries depict ordinary life and occasions among the Affaltrach Jewish community. It can be found [http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/affaltrach_synagoge.htm#Affaltrach here].

A 2006 Dentsu poll found that 7% of Ireland had no religion. According to Greeley (2003), 5% of those in Ireland do not believe in God, but only 2% accept the self-identification of “atheist.” According to Ingelhart et al. (2004) and Davie (1999), 4% of the Irish do not believe in God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atheism.ru/library/phil_1.phtml |title=мЮСВМШИ ЮРЕХГЛ.

In a 2007-2008 [[Gallup Poll]], 42% of Ireland answered no to the question "Does religion occupy an important place in your life?" and in the 2011 Gallup, 53% of Ireland answered no.

A 2010 Bishops Conference survey found that 10.1% of Irish Roman Catholics did not believe in god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicbishops.ie/wp-content/uploads/images/stories/cco_publications/researchanddevelopment/evs_4th_wave_report.pdf|title=Religious Practice and Values in Ireland: A  summary of European Values Study 4th wave data|publisher=Catholicbishops.ie|accessdate=2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 WIN-Gallup International poll, Ireland had the 2nd highest decline in religiosity from 69% in 2005 to 47% in 2012, while those who considered themselves not a religious person increased 25% in 2005 to 44% in 2012. The poll also showed that 10% of Ireland now consider themselves convinced atheists, which is a vast increase from 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |title=Atheists Rally On National Mall |publisher=Redcreearch.ie |accessdate=2012-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016062403/http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This number is thought to be higher due to citizens describing themselves as "[[cultural Catholic]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Big rise in people with no faith but 84pc still Catholic|publisher=[[Irish Independent|Independent]]|date=|url= http://www.independent.ie/national-news/big-rise-in-people-with-no-faith-but-84pc-still-catholic-3066470.html|accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the 2016 Irish Census, approximately 9.5% of Irish citizens are irreligious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Census 2016 Summary Results - Part 1 - Chapter 8 - Religion |url= http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/population/2017/Chapter_8_Religion.pdf|quote = "''The total number of people with no religion on a usual residence basis in April 2016 stood at 451,941 [of 4,761,900]''" |accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Humanist Association of Ireland]] represents the non-religious in Ireland, as well as specifically those who identify as [[secular humanism|humanists]]. It received the ability to conduct legal marriages in 2012. As of 2018, it conducts more marriages in Ireland than the [[Church of Ireland]], but still less than the Catholic Church.

There is also an [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim mission in [[Antigua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTQhAAAAMAAJ&amp;q&amp;dq&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PjuMU9e6I8rKOa2EgdgE&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAg | title=Ahmadiyya Muslim Foreign Missions | page=65 | author=Mirza Mubarak Ahmad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside St. John's, there is the Muslim Community of Antigua and Barbuda in [[Codrington, Barbuda]]. A [[Pew Research Center]] survey in 2016 calculated the total number to be around 950.

[[Antigua and Barbuda]] have yet to establish a proper [[mosque]], Islamic centre or institutions for Muslims in the country. The proposed site of the first mosque to be constructed by the Antigua and Barbuda International Islamic Society (ABIIS) is located on American Road in St. John's. Currently the location used for a mosque is a small hut which could accommodate about thirty individuals and is available for Friday prayers, the five daily [[salat]], the two [[Muslim holidays|Eid]]s and [[qurbani]].

'''James Joseph Sylvester''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] H[[FRSE]] LLD (3 September 1814&amp;nbsp;– 15 March 1897) was an [[United Kingdom|English]] [[mathematician]]. He made fundamental contributions to [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix theory]], [[invariant theory]], [[number theory]], [[Integer partition|partition theory]], and [[combinatorics]].  He played a leadership role in American mathematics in the later half of the 19th century as a professor at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] and as founder of the [[American Journal of Mathematics]].  At his death, he was professor at [[Oxford University|Oxford]].

== Biography ==
James Joseph was born in [[London]] on 3 September 1814, the son of Abraham Joseph, a merchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  James later adopted the surname Sylvester when his older brother did so upon emigration to the United States—a country which at that time required all immigrants to have a given name, a middle name, and a surname. 

At the age of 14, Sylvester was a student of [[Augustus De Morgan]] at the [[University of London]]. His family withdrew him from the University after he was accused of stabbing a fellow student with a knife. Subsequently, he attended the [[Liverpool Royal Institution]].

Sylvester began his study of mathematics at [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in 1831,&lt;ref name="ACAD"&gt;{{acad|id=SLVR831JJ|name=Sylvester, James Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his tutor was [[John Hymers]]. Although his studies were interrupted for almost two years due to a prolonged illness, he nevertheless ranked second in Cambridge's famous mathematical examination, the [[tripos]], for which he sat in 1837. However, Sylvester was not issued a degree, because graduates at that time were required to state their acceptance of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]], and Sylvester could not do so because he was Jewish. For the same reason, he was unable to compete for a Fellowship or obtain a [[Smith's prize]].&lt;ref name="MenofMathematics"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Men_of_Mathematics.html? | title=Men of Mathematics | publisher=Simon Schuster | author=Bell, Eric Temple | year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, Sylvester became professor of natural philosophy at [[University College London]] and in 1839 a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1841, he was awarded a BA and an [[Master's degree|MA]] by [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. In the same year he moved to the United States to become a professor of mathematics at the [[University of Virginia]], but left after less than four months following a violent encounter with two students he had disciplined. He moved to New York City and began friendships with the Harvard mathematician Benjamin Peirce (father of Charles Sanders Peirce) and the Princeton physicist Joseph Henry.  However, he left in November 1843 after being denied appointment as Professor of Mathematics at Columbia College (now University), again for his Judaism, and returned to England.

On his return to England, he was hired in 1844 by the Equity and Law Life Assurance Society for which he developed successful actuarial models and served as de facto CEO, a position that required a law degree. As a result, he studied for the Bar, meeting a fellow British mathematician studying law, [[Arthur Cayley]], with whom he made significant contributions to invariant theory and also [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix theory]] during a long collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Parshall&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=May 2018}}  He did not obtain a position teaching university mathematics until 1855, when he was appointed professor of mathematics at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], from which he retired in 1869, because the compulsory retirement age was 55. The Woolwich academy initially refused to pay Sylvester his full pension, and only relented after a prolonged public controversy, during which Sylvester took his case to the letters page of ''[[The Times]]''.

One of Sylvester's lifelong passions was for poetry; he read and translated works from the original French, German, Italian, [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], and many of his mathematical papers contain illustrative quotes from classical poetry. Following his early retirement, {{harvtxt|Sylvester|1870}} published a book entitled ''[[The Laws of Verse]]'' in which he attempted to codify a set of laws for [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]] in poetry.

In 1872, he finally received his B.A. and M.A. from Cambridge, having been denied the degrees due to his being a Jew.&lt;ref name="ACAD" /&gt;

In 1876&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Preliminary Outline of Instructions for the Session Beginning October 3, 1876|last = |first = |date = September 1876|journal = Johns Hopkins University.  Official Circulars.  No. 5|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sylvester again crossed the Atlantic Ocean to become the inaugural professor of mathematics at the new [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. His salary was $5,000 (quite generous for the time), which he demanded be paid in gold.  After negotiation, agreement was reached on a salary that was not paid in gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pioneer: A History of the Johns Hopkins University, 1874-1889|last = Hawkins|first = Hugh|publisher = Cornell University Press|year = 1960|isbn = |location = Ithaca, NY|pages = 41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1878 he founded the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]''.  The only other mathematical journal in the US at that time was the ''Analyst'', which eventually became the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]''.

In 1883, he returned to England to take up the [[Savilian Professor of Geometry]] at [[Oxford University]]. He held this chair until his death, although in 1892 the University appointed a deputy professor to the same chair.

Sylvester died in London on 15 March 1897. He is buried in [[Balls Pond Road Jewish Cemetery]] on Kingsbury Road in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Sylvester invented a great number of mathematical terms such as "[[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]" (in 1850),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Matrices_and_determinants.html Matrices and determinants], The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]" (combinatorics)&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  J. J. Sylvester (February 7, 1878) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KcoKAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=Sylvester&amp;pg=PA284#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Chemistry and algebra,"] ''Nature'', '''17''' :  284.  From page 284:  "Every invariant and covariant thus becomes expressible by a ''graph'' precisely identical with a Kekuléan diagram or chemicograph."
*  J. J. Sylvester (1878) [https://books.google.com/books?id=1q0EAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "On an application of the new atomic theory to the graphical representation of the invariants and covariants of binary quantics, — with three appendices,"] ''American Journal of Mathematics, Pure and Applied'', '''1''' (1) :  64-90.  The term "graph" first appears in this paper on page 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[discriminant]]".&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Sylvester (1851) "On a remarkable discovery in the theory of canonical forms and of hyperdeterminants," ''Philosophical Magazine'', 4th series, '''2''' :  391–410; Sylvester coins the word "discriminant" on [https://books.google.com/books?id=DBNDAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA406#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 406].&lt;/ref&gt;  He coined the term "totient" for [[Euler's totient function]] φ(''n'').&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Sylvester (1879) "On certain ternary cubic-form equations," ''American Journal of Mathematics'', '''2''' : 357–393; Sylvester coins the term "totient" on [https://books.google.com/books?id=-AcPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA361#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 361]:  "(the so-called ''Φ'' function of any number I shall here and hereafter designate as its ''τ'' function and call its Totient)"&lt;/ref&gt;  His collected scientific work fills four volumes. In 1880, the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]] awarded Sylvester the [[Copley Medal]], its highest award for scientific achievement; in 1901, it instituted the [[Sylvester Medal]] in his memory, to encourage mathematical research after his death in [[Oxford]]. In [[Discrete geometry]] he is remembered for [[Sylvester–Gallai theorem|Sylvester's Problem]] and a result on the [[orchard problem]].

Sylvester House, a portion of an undergraduate dormitory at [[Johns Hopkins University]], is named in his honor. Several professorships there are named in his honor also.

His father, a former [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] pastor, founded [[Lakewood Church]], of which Osteen is the current senior pastor, in the back of an old feed store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christnotes.org/_joel-osteen.asp Christ Notes, ''Joel Osteen Books and Ministry''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625224321/http://www.christnotes.org/_joel-osteen.asp |date=June 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Humble High School]], a public high school in the city of [[Humble, Texas]], from which he graduated in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-dsWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=joel+osteen+humble+high+school+1981&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sdsnug4XKb&amp;sig=_KGsmolSSbFHElVbRKNt5PsKNJk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd49nz-v_VAhXPfFAKHZfzCRAQ6AEIOTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=joel%20osteen%20humble%20high%20school%201981&amp;f=false |title = Salvation with a Smile: Joel Osteen, Lakewood Church, and American Christianity |work = NYU Press |author = Phillip Luke Sinitiere |date = November 13, 2015 |accessdate = August 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Oral Roberts University]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], where he studied radio and television [[Communication studies|communications]], but did not graduate and did not receive a degree from a [[divinity school]].&lt;ref name=About /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865587553/Popular-positive-pastor-Joel-Osteen-brings-Night-of-Hope-to-Utah.html?pg=all |title = Popular positive pastor Joel Osteen brings 'Night of Hope' to Utah |date = October 2, 2013 |work = DeseretNews.com |accessdate = September 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, he returned to Houston and founded Lakewood's television program, where he produced his father's televised sermons for 17 years until January 1999, when his father died unexpectedly from a heart attack.&lt;ref name=About /&gt;&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite news |title = Joel Osteen: The Man Behind America's Largest Church |url = http://www.cbn.com/700club/features/amazing/osteen_010408.aspx |publisher = CBN.com |accessdate = November 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Osteen's father encouraged him to preach for many years, but he declined, preferring to work behind the scenes until January 17, 1999, when he accepted his father's suggestion and he preached his first sermon. John Osteen died six days later of a heart attack. Two weeks after his father's death, Osteen began preaching regularly and later that year was installed as the new senior pastor of Lakewood Church on October 3, 1999.&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{cite news |last = Matthieu |first = Jennifer |title = Power House |url = http://www.houstonpress.com/2002-04-04/news/power-house/full/ |accessdate = January 31, 2014 |newspaper = Houston Press |date = April 2, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Lakewood's attendance has grown from 5,000 to 43,000.&lt;ref name=WorldVision /&gt;

In 2003, Lakewood Church acquired the [[Compaq Center (Houston)|Compaq Center]], former home of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[Houston Rockets]].

=== Preaching style ===
Osteen's sermon preparation involves memorizing his remarks and listening to himself on tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Joel Osteen: By the numbers and other interesting facts |url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/joel-osteen-talks-biggest-preaching-mistake-owning-the-room-94667/ |date = April 25, 2013 |work = Christian Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osteen says that he chooses to focus more on the goodness of God and on living an obedient life rather than on sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,110240,00.html |title = Fox News on Osteen |publisher = Fox News |accessdate = September 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that he tries to teach Biblical principles in a simple way, emphasizing the power of love and a positive attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/11/60minutes/main3358652.shtml |title = Joel Osteen Answers His Critics |date = October 11, 2007 |publisher = CBS News |accessdate = September 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he does not focus more on sin, the devil and hell in detail, Osteen stated in an interview with [[CBN News]]:

{{quote|When I grew up, the devil was a reason why I had a headache or the devil was the reason I got mad today. We always blamed the devil. I think today when I say the enemy, I like to make it broader. Sometimes the enemy can be our own thoughts. We've trained ourselves the wrong way. Or the enemy can be our own lack of discipline. Some people preach about hell like you're already going there, and to me the Gospel means 'Good News.' I'd rather say God is a God of mercy. So I think the people already know what they're doing wrong, and I certainly believe in hell. But to me, when I see thousands of people before me, it just doesn't come out of me to say, 'You guys are terrible, and you're going to hell.' I'd rather say that God is a God of mercy. You've got to live an obedient life, but for every mistake you've made, there's mercy there, and I believe we can do better.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt;}}

== Books ==

Osteen's first book, ''[[Your Best Life Now]]: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential'', was released in October 2004, and reached the number 1 position on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].

Osteen has also stated he believes a person can be freed from a lifestyle of homosexuality; it is a process and God can free anyone of any sin or addiction.&lt;ref name=morgan /&gt; Osteen has also stressed he does not approve of [[homophobia]], but his faith is based on his reading of the Scriptures.&lt;ref name=morgan /&gt; He has said the church has a tendency to become overly focused on single issues (such as homosexuality) to the point of neglecting others.&lt;ref name=walters /&gt;&lt;ref name=morgan /&gt;

In an interview on [[Fox News]] in 2008 during the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2008|Republican Party Presidential primary race]], when discussing whether he thought that [[Mormonism|Mormons]] were [[Christian]]s, Osteen indicated that he believed that they were.

== Prosperity gospel criticism ==
Osteen's sermons and writings are sometimes criticized for promoting [[prosperity theology]], or the prosperity gospel, a belief that the reward of material gain is the will of God for all pious Christians.&lt;ref name=blumenthal /&gt;&lt;ref name=lite /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Stephen Brooks (academic)|Stephen Brooks]] |title = American Exceptionalism in the Age of Obama |year = 2013 |page = 51 |quote = ...

Horton stated that the problem with Osteen's message is that it makes religion about us instead of about God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/11/60minutes/main3358652.shtml |date = October 14, 2007 |accessdate = May 13, 2011 |title = Joel Osteen Answers his Critics |publisher = CBS News ''[[60 Minutes]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked if he is a prosperity teacher, Osteen responded that if prosperity means God wants people to be blessed and healthy and have good relationships, then he considers himself a prosperity teacher, but if it is about money, he does not. He has specifically stated that he never preaches about money because of the reputation of [[televangelist]]s.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt;

In an interview with [[The Christian Post]] on April 21, 2013, Osteen expressed his sentiments on being perceived as being part of the prosperity gospel. "I get grouped into the prosperity gospel and I never think it's fair, but it's just what it is. I think prosperity, and I've said it 1,000 times, it's being healthy, it's having great children, it's having peace of mind. Money is part of it; and yes, I believe God wants us to excel ... to be blessed so we can be a bigger blessing to others. I feel very rewarded. I wrote a book and sold millions of copies; and Victoria and I were able to help more people than we ever dreamed of. But when I hear the term prosperity gospel, I think people are sometimes saying, 'Well, he's just asking for money'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/interview-joel-osteen-on-life-tragedy-and-why-he-shuns-prosperity-gospel-label-94355/ |title = Interview: Joel Osteen on Life, Tragedy and Why He Shuns 'Prosperity Gospel' Label |work = Christian Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2018, less than a year after Harvey struck, the City of Houston and Mayor [[Sylvester Turner]] proclaimed a day in honor of Lakewood and Osteen's assistance in rebuild efforts across the Houston area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://abc13.com/society/joel-osteen-honored-by-city-of-houston-for-post-harvey-help/3957138/ |title = Joel Osteen honored by city of Houston for post-Harvey help |date = August 14, 2018 |work = ABC13 Houston |access-date = August 15, 2018 |language = en-US }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2018/08/14/300096/lakewood-church-receives-mayors-proclamation-for-harvey-support-after-initial-criticism/|title=Lakewood Church Receives Mayor's Proclamation for Harvey Support – After Initial Criticism {{!}} Houston Public Media|last=Martin|first=Florian|date=August 14, 2018|work=Houston Public Media|access-date=August 15, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stated Lakewood and its pastors have provided ''"assistance to more than 1,150 Houston-area families whose homes were damaged or destroyed by floodwaters"'' and bought ''"1.1 million dollars in building materials, furniture, appliances, and paid labor, as well as through the contribution of more than 2,500 volunteers".''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/pastor-osteen-recognized-for-his-work-during-hurricane-harvey-with-surprise-proclamation |title = Lakewood Church pastors recognized for work during Hurricane Harvey |last = FOX |work = KSAZ |access-date = August 15, 2018 |language = en-US }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lawsuits ==
In 2011 Osteen and Lakewood Church were sued by the band [[The American Dollar (band)|The American Dollar]] for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/joel-osteen-church-sued-by-band-for-3m-54585/ |title = Joel Osteen, Church Sued by Band for $3M |publisher = Christian Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; A judge in 2012 ruled in favor of Osteen, but gave The American Dollar leave to amend the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new |url = http://www.houstonpress.com/news/joel-osteen-and-lakewood-mostly-win-copyright-suit-filed-by-indie-duo-6726800 |title = Joel Osteen &amp; Lakewood Mostly Win Copyright Suit Filed by Indie Duo |publisher = Houston Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, a family filed a lawsuit against Lakewood Church and Osteen claiming their 18-month-old daughter suffered injuries following an altercation at the church in May 2014.  Lakewood Church said it was unable to confirm the story, and the suit was settled by the church's insurance company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new |url = https://www.click2houston.com/news/lakewood-church-facing-lawsuit-after-family-says-young-child-hurt-during-service |title = Lakewood Church, Joel Osteen facing lawsuit after family says young child hurt during service |publisher = click2houston.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://hellochristian.com/6976-joel-osteen-sued-after-church-staff-body-slams-young-child-during-service |title = Joel Osteen Sued After Church Staff 'Body-Slams' Young Child During Service |publisher = Hello Christian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kalachakra''' ({{lang-sa|{{IAST|Kālacakra}}}}, {{bo|t=དུས་ཀྱི་འཁོར་ལོ།|w=dus kyi 'khor lo}}; {{lang-mn|Цогт Цагийн Хүрдэн}} ''Tsogt Tsagiin Hurden''; {{zh|c=時輪}}) is a term used in [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]] that means "[[wheel of time|wheel(s) of time]]".

"Kālacakra" is one of many tantric teachings and esoteric practices in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=newman51/&gt; It is an active Vajrayana tradition, and has been offered to large public audiences. The tradition combines myth and history, whereby actual historical events become an allegory for the spiritual drama within a person, drawing symbolic or allegorical lessons for inner transformation towards realizing [[buddha-nature]].&lt;ref name=newman51/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dalai Lama|editor=Jeffrey Hopkins|title=Kalachakra Tantra: Rite of Initiation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAYmCwAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-886-3|pages=13–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important texts of this tradition include ''Kalachakra Tantra'' and ''[[Vimalaprabha|Vimalaprabhā]]''. The tradition's roots are in India, but its most active history and presence has been in the monasteries of Tibet.&lt;ref name=newman51&gt;{{cite book|author=John Newman|editor=Geshe Lhundub Sopa|title=The Wheel of Time: Kalachakra in Context|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=iGDCQNn0C9oC |year=1991| publisher=Shambhala|isbn= 978-1-55939-779-7|pages=51–54, 62-77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition is a form of [[nondualism]], and devotees of the tradition believe that the Kalachakra was taught by [[Gautama Buddha]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dakpo Tashi Namgyal|title=Mahamudra: The Moonlight: Quintessence of Mind and Meditation|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LoWQAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-86171-950-1|pages=444 note 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fabrice Midal|title=Recalling Chogyam Trungpa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qT7xLbSCJJQC&amp;pg=PA457|year=2005|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-0-8348-2162-0|pages=457–458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kālacakra tradition==
Kālacakra refers both to a patron Tantric deity or [[yidam]] ({{bo|w=yi dam}}) of Vajrayana Buddhism and to the philosophies and meditation practices contained within the ''Kālacakra Tantra'' and its many commentaries. The ''Kālacakra Tantra'' is more properly called the ''Kālacakra Laghutantra'', and is said to be an abridged form of an original text, the ''Kālacakra Mūlatantra'' which is no longer extant. Some Buddhist masters assert that Kālacakra is the most advanced form of Vajrayana practice; it certainly is one of the most complex systems within tantric Buddhism.

The Kālacakra tradition revolves around the concept of time ([[Kāla (time)|kāla]]) and cycles ([[chakra]]): from the cycles of the planets,&lt;ref name=Rite&gt;{{cite book|author=14th Dalai Lama|authorlink=14th Dalai Lama|title=Kālachakra Tantra: Rite of Initiation for the Stage of Generation: a Commentary on the Text of Kay-drup-ge-lek-bēl-sang-bō|year=1985|publisher=Wisdom Publications|location=London|isbn=978-0-86171-028-7|page=212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BdgKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA212|edition=2|editor=Hopkins, Jeffrey|quote=The external Kālacakra refers to all of the environment - the mountains, fences, homes, planets, constellations of stars, solar systems, and so forth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the cycles of human breathing, it teaches the practice of working with the most subtle energies within one's body on the path to enlightenment.

The Kālacakra deity represents a [[buddhahood]] and thus [[omniscience]]. Since Kālacakra ''is'' time and everything is the flow of time, Kālacakra knows all.  Kālacakri, his spiritual consort and complement, is aware of everything that is timeless, not time-bound or out of the realm of time. In [[Yab-Yum]], they are temporality and atemporality conjoined. Similarly, the wheel is without beginning or end. The term "wheel" evoked herewith is a principal polyvalent sign, teaching tool, organising metaphor and iconographic device within [[Indian religions]]. Some "wheel" cognates are the [[ashtamangala|aṣṭamaṅgala]] symbol of the [[dharmacakra]], [[Vishnu]]'s [[Sudarshana Chakra]] and the theory of [[saṃsāra]].

Kālacakra refers to many different traditions: for example, it is related to Hindu [[Shaivism|Shaiva]], [[Samkhya]], [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]], [[Vedas|Vedic]], [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] and [[Puranas|Puranic]] traditions and also to Jainism. The Kālacakra mandala includes deities which are equally accepted by [[Hindu]]s, [[Jainism|Jains]] and Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140327125134/http://kalachakranet.org/kalachakra_tantra_history.html Kalachakra History] //archived 16 Sep 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kālacakra deity resides in the center of the mandala in his palace consisting of four mandalas, one within the other: the mandalas of body, speech, and mind, and in the very center, wisdom and great bliss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewildrose.net/tibetan_buddhism.html |title=Tibetan Buddhism - Kalachakra Tantra |publisher=Thewildrose.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kālacakra sand mandala is dedicated to both individual and world peace and physical balance. The Dalai Lama explains, "It is a way of planting a seed, and the seed will have karmic effect. One doesn’t need to be present at the Kalachakra ceremony in order to receive its benefits."{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Kalachakra Tantra==
[[File:Kalachakradeitydis.jpg|thumb|Kālacakra Deity with consort [[Visvamata]]]]

The Kālacakra Tantra is a key text of the Kalacakra tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Khedrup Norsang Gyatso|title=Ornament of Stainless Light: An Exposition of the Kalachakra Tantra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IaNcCwAAQBAJ|year=2016| publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn= 978-0-86171-742-2|pages=i–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into five chapters.&lt;ref&gt;Kilty, G ''Ornament of Stainless Light'', Wisdom 2004, {{ISBN|0-86171-452-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ground Kālacakra===
The first two chapters are considered the "ground Kālacakra." The first chapter deals with what is called the "outer Kālacakra"—the physical world– and in particular the calculation system for the Kālacakra calendar, the birth and death of universes, our solar system and the workings of the elements.

The second chapter deals with the "inner Kālacakra," and concerns processes of human gestation and birth, the classification of the functions within the human body and experience, and the vajra-kaya; the expression of human physical existence in terms of channels, winds, drops and so forth. Human experience is by some described in terms of four mind states: waking, dream, deep sleep, and a fourth state which is available through the energies of sexual orgasm. The potentials (drops) which give rise to these states are described, together with the processes that flow from them.

===Path and fruition===
The last three chapters describe the "other" or "alternative Kālacakra," and deal with the path and fruition. The third chapter deals with the preparation for the meditation practices of the system: the initiations of Kālacakra. The fourth chapter explains the actual meditation practices themselves, both the meditation on the mandala and its deities in the generation stage practices, and the perfection or completion stage practices of the [[Six Yogas of Kalacakra]]. The fifth and final chapter describes the state of enlightenment (Relijin) that results from the practice.

===Prophecy===

====Holy war====
The Kālacakra Tantra contains passages that refer to [[Islam]], calling Muslims as ''[[mleccha]]'' (barbarians). It contains the prophecy of a holy war between Buddhists led by the twenty fifth warrior-king Chakravartin Kalki and the barbarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yijiu JIN|title=Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-PzDQAAQBAJ |year=2017|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-474-2800-8|pages=49–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Riesebrodt|title=The Promise of Salvation: A Theory of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guTEpz98vYMC&amp;pg=PA167|year=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-71394-6|pages=167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald S.

They combined their idea of [[Shambhala]] with Kalki to reflect the theo-political situation they faced after the arrival of Islam in Central Asia and western Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhism in Practice: (Abridged Edition)|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2015|author=John Newman| editor= Donald S.

One of the most important Buddhist commentaries on Kalachakra Tantra, named ''[[Vimalaprabha]]'' and dated to the 11th-century, provides further details of this holy war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wheel of Time: Kalachakra in Context|pages=56-78, 83-86 with notes|editor=Geshe Lhundub Sopa |author=John Newman| year= 1985 |publisher=Sambhala}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Vimalaprabha'' mentions an event in the year "403" in Tibetan number symbols stating it to be the "year of the lord of the barbarians".&lt;ref name=newman56/&gt; This combined by the text's statement that "Muhammad is the incarnation of al-Rahman" and the teacher of the barbarian dharma, states Newman, suggests that the 403 year must be in the era of Hijra, or equal 1012-1013 CE. The many Tibetan translations of the ''Kalachakra tantra'' and the commentaries therein, according to Alexander Berzin, mention practices such as the barbarians slaughtering cattle while reciting the name of its god, the veiling of women, circumcision, and five daily prayers facing their holy land, all of which leaves little doubt that the prophecy part of the text is referring to Islam.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Leukel2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Berzin|editor=Perry Schmidt-Leukel|title=Islam and Inter-faith Relations: The Gerald Weisfeld Lectures 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEYqAQAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=SCM Press|pages=230–238; context: 225-247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, this supports the dating of this Kalachakra tradition text to the 11th-century by Tibetan and Western scholars, and linking it to the history of Buddhism of that period.&lt;ref name=newman56&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wheel of Time: The Kalachakra in Context|pages=56-79, 85-87 with notes|editor=Geshe Lhundub Sopa et al |author=John Newman| year= 1985 |publisher= Shambhala| isbn= 978-15593-97-797}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kalachakra'' was introduced into Tibet in 1027 CE according to Tibetan records and per the ''rabjung'' calculations of the Tibetan astronomical calendrical calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yijiu JIN|title=Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-PzDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51|year=2017 |publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-474-2800-8|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal|title=Light of Fearless Indestructible Wisdom: The Life and Legacy of His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vg40t_XIOZEC&amp;pg=PA248 |year=2008|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-55939-839-8|pages=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Symbolic inner war====
Another interpretation of Kālacakra's prophecy is that it refers to internal war against mental and emotional aggression. Fifteenth century Gelug commentor Khedrub Je interprets "holy war" symbolically, teaching that it mainly refers to the inner battle of the religious practitioner against barbarian tendencies.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Cosmology and calendar===
The phrase "as it is outside, so it is within the body" is often found in the Kālacakra tantra to emphasize the similarities and correspondence between human beings and the [[cosmos]].

In Tibet, the Kālacakra text is the basis of [[Tibetan calendar|Tibetan astrological calendars]].&lt;ref&gt;Tibetan Astrology by Philippe Cornu, Shambala 1997, {{ISBN|1-57062-217-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is luni-solar system and employs complicated astronomical calculations to determine, for example, the exact location of the planets. The text also is the basis of some Tibetan astrology manuals.

==History and origin==
[[File:Rigdan Tagpa.jpg|thumb|Mañjushrīkīrti ({{bo|t=འཇམ་དཔལ་གྲགས་པ}}, [[THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription|THL]] ''Jampel Drakpa''), [[Kings of Shambhala|King of Shambhala]]]]

===Original Teaching in India and Later Teachings in Kingdom of Shambhala===
According to the Ka-tan system of time calculation in the Kalachakra tradition, Buddha is believed to have died about 833 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Das, Sarat Chandra (1882). ''Contributions on the Religion and History of Tibet''. First published in: ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'', Vol. LI. Reprint: Manjushri Publishing House, Delhi. 1970, pp. 81-82 footnote 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Kālacakra tantra'', the Buddha taught the first Kālacakra root tantra in [[Dharanikota]] (near modern [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravathi]]) in 5th century B.C. of southeastern [[India]], supposedly bilocating (appearing in two places at once) at the same time as he was also delivering the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]] sutras at [[Griddhraj Parvat]] in [[Bihar]]. Along with King Suchandra, ninety-six minor kings and emissaries from Shambhala were also said to have received the teachings. The ''Kālacakra'' thus passed directly to [[Shambhala]], where it was held exclusively for hundreds of years. Later [[Kings of Shambhala]], Mañjushrīkīrti and Pundarika, are said to have condensed and simplified the teachings into the ''Śri Kālacakra'' or ''Laghutantra'' and its main commentary, the ''[[Vimalaprabha]]'', which remain extant today as the heart of the Kālacakra literature. Fragments of the original tantra have survived; the most significant fragment, the ''Sekkodesha'', was commented upon by [[Naropa]].

Mañjuśrīkīrti ({{bo|t=འཇམ་དཔལ་གྲགས་པ|w='jam dpal grags pa|s=Jambé Drakpa}}) is said to have been born in 159 BCE and ruled over Shambhala and 100,000 cities. In his domain lived 300,510 Lalo Mutegpa ([[Mleccha]], Yavana) with heretical beliefs in Nimai sinta (sun). He expelled all these heretics from his dominions but they accepted the ''piṭaka''s (Buddhist texts) and pleaded that they be allowed to return. He accepted their petitions and taught them the ''Kālacakra'' teachings. In 59 BCE he abdicated his throne to his son, Puṇḍārika, and died soon afterwards, entering the [[saṃbhogakāya]] of [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;Das, Sarat Chandra (1882). ''Contributions on the Religion and History of Tibet''. First published in: ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'', Vol. LI. Reprint: Manjushri Publishing House, Delhi. 1970, pp. 81-82; {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chilupa/Kālacakrapada===
There are currently two main traditions of ''Kālacakra'', the Ra lineage ({{bo|w=rva lugs}}) and the Dro lineage ({{bo|w=bro lugs}}). Although there were many translations of the ''Kālacakra'' texts from Sanskrit into Tibetan, the Ra and Dro translations are considered to be the most reliable (more about the two lineages below). The two lineages offer slightly differing accounts of how the ''Kālacakra'' teachings returned to India from Shambhala.

In both traditions, the ''Kālacakra'' and its related commentaries (sometimes referred to as the ''Bodhisattvas Corpus'') were returned to India in 966&lt;small&gt;CE&lt;/small&gt; by an Indian [[pandit]]. In the Ra tradition this figure is known as Chilupa, and in the Dro tradition as Kālacakrapada the Greater. Scholars such as Helmut Hoffman have suggested they are the same person. The first masters of the tradition disguised themselves with pseudonyms, so the Indian oral traditions recorded by the Tibetans contain a mass of contradictions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Chilupa/Kālacakrapada is said to have set out to receive the Kālacakra teachings in Shambhala, along the journey to which he encountered the Kulika (Shambhala) king Durjaya manifesting as [[Mañjuśrī]], who conferred the Kālacakra initiation on him, based on his pure motivation.

Upon returning to India, Chilupa/Kālacakrapada is said to have defeated in debate Nadapada (Tib. [[Naropa]]), abbot of [[Nalanda]], a great center of Buddhist thought at that time. Chilupa/Kālacakrapada then initiated Nadapada (who became known as Kālacakrapada the Lesser) into the ''Kālacakra'', and the tradition thereafter in India and Tibet stems from these two. Nadapada established the teachings as legitimate in the eyes of the Nalanda community, and initiated into the ''Kālacakra'' such masters as [[Atiśa]] (who, in turn, initiated the Kālacakra master [[Pindo Acharya]] (Tib. ''Pitopa'')).

A Tibetan history, the ''Dpag bsam ljon bzang'', as well as architectural evidence, indicates that the [[Ratnagiri, Odisha]] [[mahavihara]] was an important center for the dissemination of the ''Kālacakratantra'' in India.

The ''Kālacakra'' tradition, along with all Buddhism, vanished from India in the wake of the [[Muslim]] invasions, surviving only in [[Nepal]].

===Spread to Tibet===
[[File:Kala Chakra.jpg|thumb|Kālacakra statue in [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York City]]]]
The Dro lineage was established in Tibet by a [[Kashmir]]i disciple of Nalandapa named Pandita Somanatha, who traveled to Tibet in 1027 (or 1064&lt;small&gt;CE&lt;/small&gt;, depending on the calendar used), and his translator '''Dro''' [[Lotsawa]] Shérap Drak {{bo|w='bro lo tsa ba shes rab grags}}, from which it takes its name. The Ra lineage was brought to Tibet by another Kashmiri disciple of Nadapada named Samantashri, and translated by '''Ra''' Lotsawa Chörap {{bo|w=rwa lo tsa ba chos rab}}.

The Ra lineage became particularly important in the [[Sakya]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, where it was held by such prominent masters as [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182–1251), [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]] (1235–1280), [[Buton Rinchen Drub|Butön Rinchen Drup]] (1290–1364), and [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen|Dölpopa Shérap Gyeltsen]] (1292–1361). The latter two, both of whom also held the Dro lineage, are particularly well known expositors of the ''Kālacakra'' in Tibet, the practice of which is said to have greatly informed Dölpopa's exposition of [[shentong]]. A strong emphasis on ''Kālacakra'' practice and exposition of the zhentong view were the principal distinguishing characteristics of the [[Jonang]] school that traces its roots to Dölpopa Shérap Gyeltsen.

The teaching of the ''Kālacakra'' was further advanced by the great Jonang scholar [[Taranatha]] (1575–1634). In the 17th century, the government of the [[5th Dalai Lama]] outlawed the Jonang school, closing down or forcibly converting most of its monasteries. The writings of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, Taranatha, and other prominent zhentong scholars were banned. Ironically, it was also at this time that the Gelug school absorbed much of the Jonang ''Kālacakra'' tradition.

Today, Kālacakra is practiced by all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, although it appears most prominently in the Gelug lineage. It is the main tantric practice for the Jonangpa, whose school persists to this day with a small number of monasteries in [[Kham]], [[Qinghai]] and [[Sichuan]]. Efforts are under way to have the Jonang tradition be recognized officially as a fifth tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.

==Practice==
{{refimprove-section|date=January 2018}}
===Initiation===
[[File:Kalachakra0045 tiny.jpg|thumb|Monks attending the January 2003 Kālacakra initiation in [[Bodh Gaya]], India]]

As in all Vajryana practices, the Kālacakra initiations empower the disciple to practice the Kālacakra tantra in the service of attaining Buddhahood. There are two main sets of initiations in Kālacakra, eleven in all. The first of these two sets concerns preparation for the generation stage meditations of Kālacakra. The second concerns preparation for the completion stage meditations known as the Six Yogas of Kālacakra. Attendees who don't intend to carry out the practice are often only given the lower seven initiations.

The Kālacakra sand [[Mandala]] is dedicated to both individual and world peace and physical balance. The Dalai Lama explains: "It is a way of planting a seed, and the seed will have karmic effect. One doesn't need to be present at the Kālacakra ceremony in order to receive its benefits."

===Kālacakra practice today in the Tibetan Buddhist schools===
Butön Rinchen Drup had considerable influence on the later development of the Gelug and Sakya traditions of Kālacakra and Dölpopa on the development of the Jonang tradition on which the Kagyu, Nyingma, and the Tsarpa branch of the Sakya draw. The Nyingma and Kagyu rely heavily on the extensive, Jonang-influenced Kālacakra commentaries of [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]] and Jamgon Kongtrul{{Ambiguous|date=November 2017}}, both of whom took a strong interest in the tradition. The Tsarpa branch of the Sakya maintain the practice lineage for the six branch yoga of Kālacakra in the Jonang tradition.

There were many other influences and much cross-fertilization between the different traditions, and indeed the Dalai Lama asserted that it is acceptable for those initiated in one Kālacakra tradition to practice in others.

====Gelugpa====
[[File:DalaiLama0054 tiny.jpg|thumb|The [[Dalai Lama]] presiding over the Kālacakra initiation in Bodh Gaya, India, in January 2003.]]

The [[Dalai Lama]]s have had specific interest in the Kālacakra practice, particularly the [[1st Dalai Lama|First]], [[2nd Dalai Lama|Second]], [[7th Dalai Lama|Seventh]], [[8th Dalai Lama|Eighth]], and the current ([[14th Dalai Lama|Fourteenth]]) Dalai Lamas. The present Dalai Lama has given over thirty Kālacakra initiations all over the world, and is the most prominent Kālacakra lineage holder alive today. Billed as the "Kālacakra for World Peace," they draw tens of thousands of people. Generally, it is unusual for tantric initiations to be given to large public assemblages, but the Kālacakra has always been an exception.

The Dalai Lama, [[Kalu Rinpoche]], and others have stated that the public exposition of this tantra is necessary in the current degenerate age. The initiation may be received simply as a blessing for the majority of those attending, however, many of the more qualified attendees do take the commitments and subsequently engage in the practice.

[[Kirti Tsenshab Rinpoche]] (1926–2006), the [[9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu]], [[Jhado Rinpoche]] and the late [[Gen Lamrimpa]] (d. 2003) were also among prominent Gelugpa Kālacakra masters.

===Kagyu===
[[File:Kalou Rimpoche Montpellier 1987.jpg|thumb|'''Kalu Rinpoche''' in 1987 at ''Kagyu Rintchen Tcheu Ling''  in [[Montpellier]], [[France]]]]

The Kālacakra tradition practiced in the [[Karma Kagyu]] and [[Shangpa Kagyu]] schools is derived from the Jonang tradition and was largely systematized by [[Jamgon Kongtrul]], who wrote the text that is now used for empowerment. The 2nd and 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul (1954–1992) were also prominent Kālacakra lineage holders, with the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul giving the initiation publicly in North America on at least one occasion (Toronto 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Kalachakranet.org/Kalachakra_tantra_history.html |title=Kālacakra History |accessdate=2008-01-07 |publisher=International Kalachakra Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327125134/http://kalachakranet.org/kalachakra_tantra_history.html |archivedate=2014-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief Kālacakra lineage holder for the Kagyu lineage was [[Kalu Rinpoche]] (1905–1990), who gave the initiation several times in Tibet, India, Europe and North America (e.g., New York 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simhas.org/kalu.html |title=Dorje Chang Kalu Rinpoche |accessdate=2008-01-07 |work=The Lion's Roar |publisher=Simhanada |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024193909/http://www.simhas.org/kalu.html |archivedate=2007-10-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Upon his death, this mantle was assumed by his heart son, [[Bokar Tulku Rinpoche]] (1940–2004), who in turn passed it on to Khenpo Lodro Donyo Rinpoche. Bokar Monastery, of which Donyo Rinpoche is now the head, features a Kālacakra stupa and is a prominent retreat center for Kālacakra practice in the Kagyu lineage.

[[Tenga Rinpoche]] was also a prominent Kagyu holder of the Kālacakra; he gave the initiation in Grabnik, Poland in August, 2005.

[[Lopon Tsechu]] performed Kālacakra initiations and build [[Kālacakra stupa]] in Karma Guen buddhist center in southern [[Spain]]. Another prominent Kālacakra master is the [[Second Beru Khyentse]].

[[Chögyam Trungpa]], while not a noted Kālacakra master, became increasingly involved later in his life with what he termed Shambhala teachings, derived in part from the Kālacakra tradition, in particular, the mind [[Terma (religion)|terma]] which he received from the [[Kalki]].

===Nyingma===
Among the prominent recent and contemporary Nyingma Kālacakra masters are [[Dzongsar Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö]] (1894–1959), [[Dilgo Khyentse]] (1910–1991), and [[Penor Rinpoche]] (1932–2009).

===Sakya===
[[File:Kalachakra Mandala Samye Ling.jpg|thumb|Kālacakra Tenfold Powerful symbol in [[stained glass]]]]
[[Sakya Trizin]], the present head of the Sakya lineage, has given the Kālacakra initiation many times and is a recognized master of the practice.

The Sakya master H.E. [[Chogye Trichen Rinpoche]] is one of the main holders of the Kālacakra teachings. Chogye Rinpoche is the head of the [[Tsharpa]] School, one of the three main schools of the Sakya tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.

One of the previous Chogye Trichen Rinpoches, Khyenrab Choje (1436–97), beheld the sustained vision of the female tantric deity [[Vajrayogini]] at Drak Yewa in central Tibet, and received extensive teachings and initiations directly from her. Two forms of Vajrayogini appeared out of the face of the rocks at Drak Yewa, one red in color and the other white, and they bestowed the Kālacakra initiation on Khyenrab Choje. When he asked if there was any proof of this, his attendant showed the master the kusha grass that Khyenrab Choje brought back with him from the initiation. It was unlike any kusha grass found in this world, with rainbow lights sparkling up and down the length of the dried blades of grass. This direct lineage from Vajrayogini is the 'shortest', the most recent and direct, lineage of the Kālacakra empowerment and teachings that exists in this world. In addition to being known as the emanation of Manjushri, Khyenrab Choje had previously been born as many of the [[Kings of Shambhala]] as well as numerous Buddhist masters of India. These are some indications of his unique relationship to the Kālacakra tradition.

Chogye Trichen Rinpoche is the holder of six different Kālacakra initiations, four of which, the Bulug, Jonang, Maitri-gyatsha, and Domjung, are contained within the Gyude Kuntu, the Collection of Tantras compiled by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and his disciple Loter Wangpo. Rinpoche has offered all six of these empowerments to Sakya Trizin, the head of the Sakya School of Tibetan Buddhism.

Rinpoche has given the Kālacakra initiation in Tibet, Mustang, Kathmandu, Malaysia, the United States, Taiwan, and Spain, and is widely regarded as a definitive authority on Kālacakra. In 1988 he traveled to the United States, giving the initiation and complete instructions in the practice of the six-branch Vajrayoga of Kālacakra according to the Jonangpa tradition in Boston.

Chogye Rinpoche has completed extensive retreat in the practice of Kālacakra, particularly of the six-branch yoga (sadangayoga) in the tradition of the Jonangpa school according to Jetsun [[Taranatha]]. In this way, Chogye Rinpoche has carried on the tradition of his predecessor Khyenrab Choje, the incarnation of the Shambhala kings who received the Kālacakra initiation from Vajrayogini herself. When Chogye Rinpoche was young, one of his teachers dreamed that Rinpoche was the son of the King of Shambhala, the pure land that upholds the tradition of Kālacakra. (See biography of Chogye Trichen Rinpoche in "Parting from the Four Attachments", Snow Lion Publications, 2003.)

===Jonang===
Once deemed heretical by the 5th Dalai Lama and successors, and even thought to be extinct, the [[Jonang]] tradition has in fact survived and is now officially recognized by the Tibetan Government in exile as a fifth school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Jonang is particularly important in that it has preserved the Kālacakra practice lineage, especially of the completion stage practices. In fact, the Kālacakra is the main tantric practice in the Jonang tradition. [[Khenpo Kunga Sherab Rinpoche]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonangfoundation.org/kunga-sherab-saljay Short Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103185114/http://www.jonangfoundation.org/kunga-sherab-saljay |date=January 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is one contemporary Jonangpa master of Kālacakra.

==Iconography==
Tantric iconography including sharp weapons, shields, and corpses similarly appears in conflict with those tenets of non-violence but instead represent the transmutation of aggression into a method for overcoming illusion and ego. Both Kālacakra and his [[dharmapala]] protector Vajravega hold a sword and shield in their paired second right and left hands. This is an expression of the Buddha's triumph over the attack of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] and his protection of all sentient beings.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert (2004) ''The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs'' {{ISBN|1-932476-10-5}} p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolism researcher Robert Beer writes the following about tantric iconography of weapons and mentions the [[charnel ground]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Many of these weapons and implements have their origins in the wrathful arena of the battlefield and the funereal realm of the charnel grounds. As primal images of destruction, slaughter, sacrifice, and necromancy these weapons were wrested from the hands of the evil and turned - as symbols - against the ultimate root of evil, the self-cherishing conceptual identity that gives rise to the five poisons of ignorance, desire, hatred, pride, and jealousy. In the hands of siddhas, dakinis, wrathful and semi-wrathful yidam deities, protective deities or dharmapalas these implements became pure symbols, weapons of transformation, and an expression of the deities' wrathful compassion which mercilessly destroys the manifold illusions of the inflated human ego.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert (2004) ''The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs'' {{ISBN|1-932476-10-5}} p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Khabawsokar''' (also read '''Khabawseker''') was an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian high official during the early to midst [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|3rd dynasty]]. He is famous for his tomb inscription and his unique nickname.&lt;ref name="pjgp"&gt;Peter Jánosi: ''Die Gräberwelt der Pyramidenzeit'' (= ''Zaberns Bildbände zur Archäologie''-series). von Zabern, Mainz 2006, {{ISBN|3805336225}}, p. 16, 31 - 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identity ==

=== Family ===
Khabawsokar was married to the ''priestess of [[Hathor]]'', ''Hathor-neferhetepes''.&lt;ref name="pjgp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wssw"/&gt;

=== Titles ===
As a high-ranking official and priest, Khabawsokar bore several elite and pious titularies:&lt;ref name="wssw"&gt;William Stevenson Smith, William Kelly Simpson: ''The art and architecture of ancient Egypt'' (= ''The Pelican history of art'', vol. 14), 2nd edition. Penguin Books, New York 1981, {{ISBN|0-14-056014-9}}, p. 63–67.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Confidant of the king'' (Egyptian: ''Rekh-neswt''). A title that allowed Khabawsokar to receive audiences at the [[pharaoh]].&lt;ref&gt;Dilwyn Jones: ''An Index of Ancient Egyptian Titles, Epithets and Phrases of the Old Kingdom'', Vol. 1 (= ''BAR International Series'', vol. 866). Archaeopress, Oxford 2000, {{ISBN|1-8417-1069-5}}, p. 357, Nr. 1325.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Privy council'' (Egyptian: ''Sa'ab'').
* ''High priest of [[Anubis]]'' (Egyptian: ''Heqa-netjer-Inpu'').
* ''God's servant of [[Seker|Sokar]]'' (Egyptian: ''Hem-netjer-Seker'').
* ''God's servant of [[Seshat]]'' (Egyptian: ''Hem-netjer-Seshat'').
* ''God's servant of [[Set (deity)|Seth]]'' (Egyptian: ''Hem-netjer-Setekh'').

=== Career ===
Khabawsokar's tomb inscriptions are of highest interest to Egyptologists and Historians alike. In fact, they belong to the earliest examples of richly decorated tomb niches with detailed lists comprising bureaucratic titles, priest offices and honorary titles.&lt;ref name="pjgp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wssw"/&gt; Additionally, Khabawsokar is, by far, the official with the highest number of priesthood titles for his time.&lt;ref&gt;Dagmar Budde: ''Die Göttin Seschat''. Wodtke und Stegbauer, Leipzig 2000, {{ISBN|3934374018}}, p. 66-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his tomb, Khabawsokar is depicted once as a sitting man in a tight gown, reaching out for an offering table full of bread (or cake). A jamb of a false door depicts him twice, each time looking into converse direction. His pose makes him look like stepping out of the door. On both of the jambs his real ("great") name and his nickname are spelled. Khabawsokar wears a fine curled wig, a heavy and finely ornamented gold collar and a belt with a golden lion head as a belt buckle. His kilt is made of [[leopard]] fur and his shoulder knots are jackal-shaped.&lt;ref name="pjgp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wssw"/&gt;

Possible contemporary office partners of Khabawsokar may have been [[Hesy-Ra|Hesyre]], [[Metjen]], [[Pehernefer]] and [[Akhetaa]]. These are likewise known for their unusually rich decorated tomb chapels and for their accurately reported careers. However, it is not proven that these officials were related to each other in any way.&lt;ref name="pjgp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wssw"/&gt;

== Tomb ==
Khabawsokar's tomb, the double mastaba ''S-3037'' was found in 1889 at [[Saqqara|North Saqqara]] by [[France|French]] archaeologist [[Auguste Mariette]]. The tomb once measured circa 33 x 19 metres and was built of mud bricks. A short corridor leads to a broad hall, forming a t-shaped crossway; the hall has walls which are niched and covered with polished [[limestone]].&lt;ref name="pjgp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wssw"/&gt;

'''Khasa-Malla kingdom''' ({{lang-ne|खस मल्ल राज्य}}), popularly known as '''Khasa Kingdom''' ({{lang-ne|खस राज्य}}), was a kingdom established in present-day [[Nepal]] around 10th century. It was ruled by kings who bore the family name "Malla" (not to be confused with the later [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla dynasty]] of Kathmandu).{{sfn|Adhikary|1997|p=37}} The Khasa Malla kings ruled western parts of Nepal during 11th-14th century.&lt;ref name="Krishna_2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Krishna P. Bhattarai |title=Nepal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aArqOqBGBQC&amp;pg=PA113 |date=1 January 2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-1-4381-0523-9 |page=113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 954 AD [[Khajuraho]] Inscription of Dhaṇga states Khasa Kingdom equivalent to [[Gauda Kingdom|Gauda of Bengal]] and [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] dynasty.{{sfn|Thakur|1990|p=287}}

== History ==
An ancient tribe named [[Khasas (Mahabharata)|Khasa]] is mentioned in several ancient legendary Indian texts, including the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. The historical Khasa kingdom is different from the territory of this legendary tribe, although there have been some speculations about a connection between the two. The historical Khasas are mentioned in several Indian inscriptions dated between 8th and 13th centuries CE.{{sfn|Thakur|1990|p=287}} The Khasa Malla kingdom was [[feudatory]] and the principalities were independent in nature.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=3}} Most of its territory was over the [[Karnali River]] basin.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=3}} Prithvi Malla had firmly established the Kingdom around 1413 A.D.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=21}} The kingdom had conquered over the half of the [[Greater Nepal]] over two hundred years.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=3}} The reign of King Punya Malla and Prithvi Malla had strict traditional Hindu ritual and customs.{{sfn|Adhikary|1997|p=81}} This kingdom disintegrated after the death of Abhaya Malla and formed the [[Baise Rajya|Baise rajya confederacy]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=21}} In the 12th century, King Nāgarāja conquered the principal [[Jumla District#Kingdom on Jumla|Jumla]] Kingdom of the central [[Himalayas]] and overran lands up to [[Bheri River]] in the east, [[Satluj river]] in the west and [[Mayum pass]] of [[Tibet]] in the north.{{sfn|Rahul|1978|p=60}} King Nāgarāja also referred as '''Jāveśvara''' ({{lang-ne|जावेश्वर}}) came from Khāripradeśa (present day [[Ngari Prefecture|Ngari Province]]) and set up his capital at [[Sinja valley|Semjā]].{{sfn|D.R. Regmi|1965|p=717}} The widely regarded most renowned King of Khasa Malla Kingdom was Prithvi Malla.{{sfn|D.R. Regmi|1965|p=717}}

==Titles, Ranks and Suffixes==
The successors of King Nāgarāja adhered to some suffix as -illa and -challa like King Chapilla, King Krachalla.{{sfn|Adhikary|1997|p=35}} ''Challa'' and ''Malla'' were titles of kings and princes. ''Rāulā'' was the title of a high-ranking official. Personalities like Malayavarma, Medinivarma, Samsarivarma, Balirāja{{refn|group=note|Balirāja went on to became sovereign king of Jumla and founder of Kalyal dynasty.{{sfn|Adhikary|1997|p=72}}}}, etc. had title of ''Rāulā''.{{sfn|Adhikary|1997|p=89}} ''Mandalesvara'' or ''Mandalik'' was a title conferred on powerful persons of the Kingdom. Royal princes, senior officials and defeated Kings were appointed to the post of ''Mandalesvara''.{{sfn|Adhikary|1997|p=84}}

After the [[Siege of Chittorgarh (1303)|Siege of Chittorgarh in 1303]], large immigration of [[Rajput]]s occurred into Nepal. Before it, few small groups of [[Rajputs]] had been entering into the region from [[Muslim invasion of India]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=3}} These immigrants were quickly absorbed into the [[Khas community]] due to larger similarities.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=3}} Historian and Jesuit Ludwig Stiller considers the [[Rajput]] interference to the politics of Khas Kingdom of Jumla was responsible for its fragmentation and he explains:{{Quote|text=Though [[Rajput|they]] were relatively few in number, they were of higher caste, warriors and of a temperament that quickly gained them the ascendancy in the princedoms in the Jumla Kingdom, their effect on the kingdom was centrifugal.|source=Ludwig Stiller's "The Rise of House of Gorkha"{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=3}}}} Francis Tucker also further states that "...the Rajputs was so often guilty of base ingratitude and treachery to gratify his ambition. They were fierce, ruthless people who would stop at nothing."{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=3}} After the late 13th century the Khas empire collapsed and divided into [[Baise Rajya]] (22 principalities) in Karnali-Bheri region and [[Chaubise rajya]] (24 principalities) in Gandaki region. These Baise and Chaubise kingdoms were ruled by [[Rajput]]s and several decentralized tribal polities.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=3}}

'''''Kūmāré''''' is an American 2011 [[documentary film]] directed by Vikram Gandhi.

To record the documentary, American filmmaker Vikram Gandhi transformed himself into Sri Kumaré, an enlightened [[guru]] from a fictional village in [[India]], by adopting a fake [[Indian English|Indian accent]] and growing out his hair and beard. In the film, Kumaré travels to [[Arizona]] to spread his made-up philosophy and gain sincere followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Kumare' film examines blurred lines of virtual identities |author=Melissa Bell |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/kumare-film-examines-blurred-lines-of-virtual-identities/2012/03/13/gIQA6BzkGS_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SXSW '11 &amp;#124; "Borat" Gets Religion: An Interview With "Kumare" Director Vikram Gandhi |author=Bryce J.

==Reception==
''Kumaré'' received fair reviews upon release.  Many movie reviewers criticized Gandhi's deception as immoral, but partially forgave Gandhi for realizing that the experiment had grown out of his control.  Many compared the character of Kumaré and the deception by Gandhi to [[Sacha Baron Cohen]]'s ''[[Borat]]'' character and film.  Those who liked the movie, like [[Stephen Holden]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' and [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', praised the film's message of "finding the guru within."&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Stephen.

The Darby campaign attracted attention when he questioned the number of Jews who died during the [[Third Reich]], placing the number around 140,000 suggesting that many of those succumbed to [[typhus]].&lt;ref name='msnbc'/&gt; The [[Associated Press]] quoted him as saying, "I am what the propagandists call a Holocaust denier, but I do not deny mass deaths that included some Jews," and "there was no systematic extermination of Jews.

During the [[Roy Moore|Alabama Ten Commandments dispute]] Darby promoted the constitutional principle of separation between religion and government.  Darby also supported Judge Moore's early argument that the federal government had no jurisdiction over this matter.  He opposed the placement of what he called "a monument to Jewish law" in a government building and saw it as an attempt to send the message that "Jewish Supremacism is the law" despite several Jewish organizations coming out against the placement of the commandments because they flouted the separation of church and state when placed in a judicial building.&lt;ref&gt;

After his surprising showing in the 2006 AG election, Darby publicly lobbied for the Alabama state Democratic Party leadership to replace the candidates who were running as Democrats in the 2008 gubernatorial election with him, claiming he was the only Democrat with a legitimate chance to be elected. The state's Democratic leadership responded in turn by publicly stating that they disavowed Darby and his beliefs and said they would not put him forward for any public office in the future. Darby lashed out against the leadership but has seen his political career completely evaporate since that time.

The '''Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland''' is the most senior office-bearer within the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]], which is Northern Ireland's largest Protestant denomination.

The Moderator is elected by the [[General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland|General Assembly]] and serves for one year as the public representative of the denomination. The moderator may be either a teaching or ruling elder from within the denomination but, as yet, no ruling elder has ever been elected to the role. The appointee's formal role involves acting as the [[Moderator of the General Assembly]]. During the rest of the year, the moderator acts as an ambassador for the General Assembly and for the Presbyterian Church in Ireland as a whole.

The government of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland has a form known as [[Presbyterian polity]], and is much like that of other Presbyterian churches around the world. Individual churches are represented at both the Presbytery (local) level and General Assembly ([[Ireland|All Ireland]]) level. 

The serving moderator is given the honorific [[Style (manner of address)|style]], '''[[Right Reverend]]''' (Rt. Rev.).&lt;ref&gt;Example assembly record addressing the serving moderator as Rt. Rev. is [https://web.archive.org/web/20061015034650/http://www.presbyterianireland.org/assembly/media/Eighth_Session_06.doc Session 8, 2006 (doc format)]. Retrieved 2 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Former moderators are known as '''[[Very Reverend]]''' (Very Rev.).&lt;ref&gt;Example listing all living former moderators and describing them as Very Rev. is [https://web.archive.org/web/20140729160522/http://presbyterianireland.org/getmedia/8573fcce-a828-4ff0-95f2-b4488d1d7d22/PCI_Assembly_Minutes_2007.pdf.aspx 2007 Directory, page 124]. Retrieved 3 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The moderator and the two [[Church of Ireland]] and two [[Roman Catholic]] archbishops are thirteenth to seventeenth in the [[order of precedence in Northern Ireland]], according to the seniority of their consecration or election.  

The current moderator is Charles McMullen.

|""You can be elected as an openly gay politician in this country, but you can't be elected as an openly atheistic one," said Lori Lipman Brown, who was hired last fall to be the Washington, D.C., lobbyist for an organization devoted to atheist causes, the Secular Coalition for America. She's believed to be the first paid lobbyist for the unbelievers in the nation's capital, the front lines of the culture wars. Now, all Brown is seeking is a constituency willing to go public. "Think of where the LGBT movement was 25 years ago," said Brown, who has worked on gay and lesbian rights issues as a legislator and attorney. "That's where atheists are today." [...] Brown, who is married and was raised a "humanistic Jew," talks about how she "came out" as an atheist several years ago, and how most atheists aren't "out yet" at work. She says atheist kids—like many gay children—are made to feel outcasts at school, and explains that she wants to erase the negative connotation to the word "atheist" just as homosexuals have reclaimed slurs like "queer" and "dyke.""&lt;ref&gt;Joe Garofoli, '[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/02/20/ATHEIST.TMP Atheists hoping to assert rights in religious era]', ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 20 February 2006 (accessed 16 June 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

|Q: "I noticed that nobody uses the "A-word"—atheist—for you. Perhaps it is a step beyond nontheist or humanist. Do you identify as an atheist?
Oates: "That's a good question. I have met Christopher Hitchens once or twice, and he has a book that I'm sure you've either read or are aware of titled ''God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything''. He is very adversarial, very eloquent, and very funny in his interviews. And, of course, he is very much a self-declared atheist.
"I'm not averse to acknowledging it, but as a novelist and a writer, I really don't want to confront and be antagonistic toward people. As soon as you declare that you are an atheist, it's like somebody declaring that he is the son of God; it arouses a lot antagonism. I'm wondering whether it might be better to avoid arousing this antagonism in order to find—not compromise—some common ground."&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Carol Oates, [http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/JoyceCarolOates.html Humanism and Its Discontents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124065507/http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/JoyceCarolOates.html |date=2012-11-24 }}, ''The Humanist'', November/December 2007 (accessed 9 June 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

|1947–
|Scientist
|Mathematical physicist and professor at [[Tulane University]].
|Although an atheist, Tipler believes 'God' will eventually exist in the last moments of the universe: 
"The theory is basically this: just as the Earth began with a Big Bang, so it will end, in a single point, which Tipler calls the Omega Point. And just as life on Earth began with a single cell which colonised the planet, so life at the end of time will, according to Tipler, "become omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient which are the three attributes of God". The Omega Point/God is the point of ultimate, infinite knowledge when the earth will be inhabited by beings who are, to all intents and purposes, computers. Tipler says they can be called beings because he defines life as information processing, as did the famous biologist Richard Dawkins, who called computers "biological objects". [...] &lt;br /&gt;
Tipler says his own viewpoint is that of an atheist. Though brought up a Christian fundamentalist, he rejected religion when he was 16, because the Church claimed the Earth was 6,000 years old, when he knew that it went back 4.6 billion years. [...] &lt;br /&gt;
Still, it seems excessively generous for the beings of the future to want to resurrect all of us. Tipler answers that they will be extremely intelligent beings, and therefore extremely curious, interested in all the variations that preceded them, from the very beginning, just as today's scientists are working to recreate the first single cell, in all its possible forms. "I think the evidence is very strong that this particular version of you and this particular version of me will actually be there in the future. It will be you and me emulated down to the atom." Why, he says, we might even end up repeating the whole interview." Megan Tressider, 'The Megan Tressider Interview: Meaning of life is, er, God and Omega; Physicist Frank J Tipler, an atheist, says he has found God',&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' (London), 18 March 1995, Features Pages, Pg. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical account==

===Lot's background===

Lot and his father Haran were born and raised in [[Ur of the Chaldees]] ({{bibleref2|Genesis|11:28, 31|9}}) in the region of [[Sumer]]ia on the [[ River Euphrates]] of lower [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name="Drum75"&gt;Drummond, Dorothy Weitz, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Leb1rh5G0YC&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Holy land, whose land?: modern dilemma, ancient roots''], p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Haran died in that land before his father Terah. ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|11:28|9}})
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Lot and His Daughters (reverse) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Albrecht Dürer]], ''[[Haller Madonna|Lot and His Daughters]]'', [[Lot's wife|his wife]] left as a pillar of salt on the road behind]]

{{Bibleref2|Genesis|11:26–32|9}} gives the "generations of [[Terah]]", Lot's grandfather, who arranged for their large family to set a course for [[Canaan]] where they could reestablish a new home. Among the family members that Lot travelled with, was his uncle Abram, (later called [[Abraham]]), one of the three [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]] of [[Israel]].

En route to Canaan, the family stopped in the ''[[Paddan Aram]]'' region, about halfway along the [[Fertile Crescent]] between Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Drum75"/&gt; They settled at the site called [[Haran (biblical place)|Haran]] where Lot's grandfather, Terah, lived the rest of his days.  He was 205 years old when he died. ({{bibleref|Genesis|11:32|9}})

{{Bibleref2|Genesis|12|9|Genesis 12}} reveals Abram's obedience to the Lord at the age of 75, in continuing his journey to the land of promise. Though Abram's father, Terah, stayed behind, his nephew Lot went with him.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|12:1–4|9|v. 1–4}} There is no mention of Lot's having a wife yet. They went southwestward&lt;ref name="Drum76"/&gt; into the land of Canaan, to the place of [[Shechem|Sichem]],{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|12:5–6|9|v. 5–6}} the present day [[West Bank]] of [[Nablus]].&lt;ref name="Drum76"&gt;Drummond, Dorothy Weitz, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Leb1rh5G0YC&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Holy land, whose land?: modern dilemma, ancient roots''], p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Later they travelled south to the hills between [[Bethel]] and [[Ai (Bible)|Hai]],{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|12:8|9|v. 8}} before journeying further toward the [[Negev|south]] of Canaan.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|12:9|9|v. 9}}

After they dwelt in the land of Canaan for a little while, a famine overtook the countryside, and they journeyed many miles farther south into [[Egypt]].{{bibleref2c|Genesis|12:10–20|9|v. 10–20}} After having dwelt in Egypt for some time, they acquired vast amounts of wealth and numbers of livestock and returned to the Bethel area.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|13:1–5|9|Gen.13:1–5}}

==={{Anchor|Abram and Lot separate}} Lot in the plain of Jordan===
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Abraham and Lot separating (State 2).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Depiction of the separation of [[Abraham]] and Lot by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]].]]

{{Bibleref2|Genesis|13|9|Genesis 13}} helps and discusses Abram and Lot's return to Canaan after the famine had passed and the lands became fertile again. They traveled back through the [[Negev]] to the hills of Bethel.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|13:1, 3|9|v. 1, 3}} With their constant movement and the sizeable numbers of livestock each family owned requiring pasture, the herdsmen of the two groups began to bicker.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|13:6–7|9|v. 6–7}} These arguments became so troublesome that Abram suggested to Lot that they part ways, lest conflict continue among the "brethren".{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|13:8–9|KJV|v. 8–9}}

Although Abram gave Lot the choice of going either north (the left hand) or south (the right hand), Lot instead looked beyond Jordan toward a well-irrigated plain and chose that land, for it seemed "like the garden of the {{LORD}}". Alas, ahead Lot could not foresee the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the transformation of the water into a saline sea. ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|13:9–11|9}}) Abram then headed south to [[Hebron]], staying within the land of Canaan. ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|13:12, 18|9}})

{{anchor|Kingdom of Sodom}}
Lot camped among the cities of the green Jordan plain and initially pitched his tent facing Sodom. Eight or so years&lt;ref&gt;Years reckoned by comparing Bible marginal (Ussher) dates: Lot's move to Sodom area margin BC 1918. Battle of Siddim margin BC 1913, the 14th year, making 1926 the first of the fourteen and 1926-1918=8 years before Lot moved there.&lt;/ref&gt; before, the five kingdoms had become vassal states of an alliance of four eastern kingdoms under the leadership of [[Chedorlaomer]], king of [[Elam]].   They served this king for twelve years, but "the thirteenth year they rebelled." ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|14:1–4|9|Genesis 14:1–4}}) The following year Chedorlaomer's four armies returned and at the [[Battle of the Vale of Siddim]], the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fell in defeat.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:5–10|9|v. 5–10}} Chedorlaomer despoiled the cities and took captives as he departed, including Lot, who by then "dwelt" in Sodom.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:11–12|9|v. 11–12}}

When Abram heard what had happened to his "brother" Lot, he armed a rescue force of three hundred and eighteen of his trained servants and caught up to the armies of the four kings in the territory of the Tribe of Dan.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:13–14|9|v. 13–14}} Abram divided his forces, which attacked at night from multiple directions, and the four kings fled northeast. Abram's pursuit continued and the "slaughter of Chedorlaomer" and the other kings was completed at Hobah, north of [[Damascus]]. Abram brought back "his brother Lot" and all the people and their belongings. ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|14:15–24|9|v. 15–24}})

=== Lot flees Sodom ===
Twenty four years after Abram and Lot began their sojourning, God changed Abram's name to Abraham, and gave him the covenant of circumcision.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|17|9}} Not long afterward, "the {{LORD}} appeared" to Abraham in the form of "three men" come to visit and have a meal with him, and after two left to go to Sodom, "Abraham stood yet before the {{LORD}}."{{bibleref2c|Genesis|18:1–22|9|Gen.18:1–22}} Abraham boldly pleaded on behalf of the people of Sodom, where Lot dwelt, and obtained assurance the city would not be destroyed if fifty righteous people were found there. He continued inquiring, reducing the minimum number for sparing the city to forty five, forty, thirty, twenty, and finally, ten.{{bibleref2c|Genesis|18:23–33|9|18:23–33}}

[[File:MountSodom061607.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Sodom]], [[Israel]], showing the so-called "[[Lot's Wife (rock formation)|Lot's Wife]]" pillar composed, like the rest of the mountain, of [[halite]].]]&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem style="display:table;"&gt;
Genesis 19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing ''them'' rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After supper that night before bedtime, the men of the city, young and old, gathered around Lot's house demanding he bring his two guests out that they might "know" them. Lot went out and closed the door behind him and prayed that they not do such wicked things, and offered them his virgin daughters, that had not "known" man, that they might know them instead, and do with as they pleased. His response infuriated the men of Sodom who accused him of being judgmental and they threatened to do worse to him than they would have done to the men.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|19:4–9|9|Gen.19:4–9}}

Before they could harm Lot and break into the house, the men pulled Lot back in and struck the intruders with blindness, and revealed to Lot that they were angels sent to destroy the place. This allowed a window of opportunity for Lot to make preparations for him and his family to leave. When he went out to the men that were engaged to marry his daughters, warning them to flee, they assumed he was joking.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|19:10–14|9|Gen.19:10–14}}

As the day began to dawn, the angels urged him to hurry up and leave; when he lingered, the angels took hold of Lot, his wife and two daughters, and transported them beyond the city and set them down. The angel told Lot, "Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed."{{bibleref2c|Genesis|19:15–17|9|Gen.19:15–17}} Lot argued that if he went to the mountain some evil would cause his death, and he requested to be allowed to flee instead to the "little" city which was closer. (This city of Bela was later called [[Zoara|Zoar]] because it was little.) His request was accepted, and they headed for Zoar instead.{{bibleref2c|Genesis|19:18–22|9|Gen.19:18–22}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem style="display:table;"&gt;
Genesis 19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Then the {{LORD}} rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the {{LORD}} out of heaven;
&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abraham could see the smoke billowing upward from the countryside.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|19:27–28|9|v. 27–28}}

Instead of both [[fire and brimstone]], [[Josephus]] has only lightning as the cause of the fire that destroyed Sodom: "God then cast a thunderbolt upon the city, and set it on fire, with its inhabitants; and laid waste the country with the like burning, as I formerly said when I wrote ''[[The Jewish War]]''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Flavius Josephus]], ''Antiquities'', [http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-1.htm#EndNote_ANT_1.21a Book 1, Chapter 11, Section 4, Sentence 3]. Also:&lt;br /&gt;
"It is related how, for the impiety of its inhabitants, it was burnt by lightning; in consequence of which there are still the remainders of that Divine fire" Josephus, [http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/war-4.htm ''Wars'' Book 4, Chapter 8, Section 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lot and his daughters===
[[File:1630 Wtewael Lot and His Daughters anagoria.JPG|thumb|''Lot and His Daughters'', [[Joachim Wtewael]], 1620s]]

The account of Lot and [[Lot's daughters|his daughters]] is in {{Bibleref2|Genesis|19:30–38|9}}
{{quotation|1=
&lt;poem&gt;Genesis 19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father ''is'' old, and ''there is'' not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, ''and'' lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.&lt;/poem&gt;}}
[[File:Lot e sue figlie - Van Somer.jpg|thumb|245px|''Lot and his daughters'' by [[Hendrick de Somer]], c. 1645]]
The older daughter conceived [[Moab]] (Hebrew מוֹאָב, lit., "from the father" [meh-Av]), father of the Moabites;{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|19:37|9|v. 37}} the younger conceived [[Ammon|Ben-Ammi]] (Hebrew בֶּן-עַמִּי, lit., "Son of my people"), father of the Ammonites.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|19:38|9|v. 38}}

The story, usually called '''Lot and his daughters''', has been the subject of [[:commons:Category:Lot and his daughters|many paintings]] over the centuries, and became one of the subjects in the [[Power of Women]] group of subjects, warning men against the dangers of succumbing to the temptations of women, while also providing an opportunity for an erotic depiction.  The scene generally shows Lot and his daughters eating and drinking in their mountain refuge.  Often the background contains a small figure of Lot's wife, and in the distance, a burning city.&lt;ref&gt;Lowenthal, Anne W.

[[File:Gentileschi, Artemisia - Lot and his Daughters - 1635-1638.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Lot and His Daughters'', [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] (1635–1638)&lt;ref&gt;"Artemisia Gentileschi"; Mary D Garrard; Rizzoli Art Series, 1993. {{ISBN|0-8478-1652-4}}&lt;br&gt;"The seduction of Lot became a popular topic in [[Baroque painting|Baroque Art]]: if in general the women are portrayed as seductresses and the mood as ribald, the female artist Artemisia Gentileschi's portrait diverges sharply, showing the women fully clothed and the mood as solemn."&lt;/ref&gt;]]
===Jewish view===
In the [[Book of Genesis|Bereshith]] of the [[Torah]], Lot is first mentioned at the end of the weekly reading portion, [[Noach (parsha)|Parashat Noach]]. The weekly reading portions that follow, concerning all of the accounts of Lot's life, are read in the [[Lech-Lecha (parsha)|Parashat Lekh Lekha]] and [[Vayeira (parsha)|Parashat Vayera]]. In the [[Midrash]], a number of additional stories concerning Lot are present, not found in the [[Tanakh]], as follows:
* Abraham took care of Lot after Haran was burned in a gigantic fire in which [[Nimrod (king)|Nimrod]], King of [[Babylon]], tried to kill Abraham.
* While in Egypt, the midrash gives Lot much credit because, despite his desire for wealth, he did not inform [[Pharaoh]] of [[Sarah]]'s secret, that she was Abraham's wife.

===Christian view===
In the Christian [[New Testament]], Lot is considered sympathetically, as a man who regretted his choice to live in Sodom, where he "vexed his righteous soul from day to day" ({{bibleref|2|Peter|2:6–9|KJV}}). Jesus spoke of future judgment coming suddenly as in the days of Lot, and warned solemnly, "Remember Lot's wife". ({{bibleref||Luke|17:28–33|KJV}})

{{Main article|Lot in Islam}}
'''Lut''' ({{lang-ar|'''لوط'''}}) in the [[Quran]] is considered to be the same as '''Lot''' in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. He is considered to be a [[Messengers of Islam|messenger of God]] and a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet of God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|26|161|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]]ic tradition, Lot lived in [[Ur of the Chaldees|Ur]] and was a nephew of [[Islamic view of Abraham|Ibrahim]] ([[Abraham]]). He migrated with Ibrahim to [[Canaan]] and was commissioned as a [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|prophet]] to the cities of [[Sodom and Gomorrah#Islamic|Sodom and Gomorrah]].&lt;ref name="Hasan26"&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Islam, Volume 1 |last=Hasan |first=Masudul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1987 |publisher=Islamic Publications |location= |isbn= |page=26 |pages= |accessdate=July 9, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18XXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;q=Lut+Sodom}} Quote: Lut was a nephew of the Prophet Abraham. He migrated with Abraham from [[Iraq#Ancient Iraq|Iraq]] to Canaan in [[Palestine (region)#Ancient period|Palestine]]. He was commissioned as a prophet to the cities of Sodom and Gomarrah, situated to the east of the Dead Sea. The people of these cities were guilty of unspeakable crimes. They were addicted to homosexuality and highway robberies. Lut warned the people but they refused to listen to him. He prayed to [[Allah]] to punish the people. Lut left the city with his followers at night. As soon as he left, Allah raised a ''[shower of brim stones?]''-end quote, text garbled.&lt;/ref&gt; His story is used as a reference by some [[Muslim]]s to demonstrate [[LGBT topics and Islam|Islam's disapproval of homosexuality]]. He was commanded by Allah to go to the land of Sodom and Gomorrah to preach [[Tawhid|monotheism]] and to stop them from their [[Lust#Islam|lustful]] and violent acts. Lut's messages were ignored by the inhabitants, prompting Sodom and Gomorrah's destruction. Though Lut left the city, his [[Lot's wife#Islamic view|wife]] was asked to be left behind by [[Angels in Islam|angels]] hence died during the destruction.&lt;ref name="Hasan26" /&gt;
The Quran defines Lot as a prophet, and holds that all prophets were examples of moral and spiritual rectitude. The Quran does not include stories of Lot's drunkenness and/or incest.

== Modern views ==

The presumptive incest between Lot and his daughters has raised many questions, debates, and theories as to what the real motives were, who really was at fault, and the level of bias the author of Genesis Chapter 19 had. However, such biblical scholars as [[Jacob Milgrom]],&lt;ref&gt;Milgrom. ''Leviticus'' 17–22, 1515–1520&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor P. Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor P. Hamilton]]. ''The Book of Genesis Chapters'' 18–50&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Calum Carmichael]]&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael. ''Legend and Incest''&lt;/ref&gt; postulate that the Levitical laws could not have been developed the way they were, without controversial issues surrounding the patriarchs of Israel, especially regarding incest. Carmichael even attributes the entire formulation of the Levitical laws to the lives of the founding fathers of the nation, including the righteous Lot (together with [[Abraham]], [[Jacob]], [[Judah (biblical person)|Judah]], [[Moses]], and [[David]]), who were outstanding figures in [[Israelite]] tradition.

According to the scholars mentioned above, the patriarchs of Israel are the key to understanding how the priestly laws concerning incest developed.  Kinship marriages amongst the patriarchs includes Abraham's marriage to his half-sister [[Sarah|Sarai]];{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|20:11–12|9|Gen.20:11–12}} the marriage of Abraham's brother, Nahor, to their niece [[Milcah]];{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|11:27–29|9|Gen.11:27–29}} Isaac's marriage to Rebekah, his first cousin once removed;{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|27:42–43, 29:10|9|Gen.27:42–43; 29:10}} Jacob's marriages with two sisters who are his first cousins;{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|29:10, 29|9|Gen.29:10, Ch.29}} and, in the instance of Moses's parents, a marriage between nephew and aunt (father's sister).{{Bibleref2c|Exodus|6:20|9|Exod.6:20}} Therefore, the patriarchal marriages surely mattered to lawgivers and they suggest a narrative basis for the laws of [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], chapters 18 and 20.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson M. Kimuhu. Leviticus: the priestly laws and prohibitions from the perspective of ancient Near East and Africa, Studies in biblical literature: Volume 115, 2008. pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;

The Levitical laws against incest were created, it has been argued, to separate the lifestyle of the Israelite from the lifestyle of the people of Canaan,{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|9:22–28|9|Gen.9:22–28}} despite any incestual involvements the patriarchs had had in the past.&lt;ref name=Kimuhu31&gt;Kimuhu. Leviticus Studies, Vol. 115, 2008. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The Levitical laws were needed for a developing nation who needed to be seen as different from the world, cleansed and blameless: The first step starting with circumcision.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|17:1, 10, 17|9|Gen.17:1, 10; Ch.17}} So nothing could be held against the patriarchs for incestuous behavior because this was part of progressive development, from the ways of the world (coming out of [[Chaldea]]) to becoming blameless before their God.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|17:1|9|Gen.17:1}}&lt;ref name=Kimuhu31 /&gt;

Some have argued that Lot's behavior in offering of his daughters to the men of Sodom in Genesis 19:8 constitutes [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]] of his daughters, which created a confusion of kinship roles that was ultimately played out through the incestuous acts in Genesis 19:30–38.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Sexual Abuse of Lot's Daughters: Reconceptualizing Kinship for the Sake of Our Daughters|author=Katherine B. Low|journal=Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion|volume=26|issue=2|date=Fall 2010|pages=37–54 |publisher=Indiana University Press|doi=10.2979/fsr.2010.26.2.37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of commentators describe the actions of Lot's daughters as rape. [[Esther Fuchs]] suggests that the text presents Lot's daughters as the "initiators and perpetrators of the incestuous 'rape'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuchs|first1=Esther|author-link=Esther Fuchs|title=Sexual Politics in the Biblical Narrative: Reading the Hebrew Bible as a Woman|date=2003|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0j6vAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209|accessdate=10 July 2015|isbn=9780567042873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nagarakertagama.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Nagarakretagama'' [[palm-leaf manuscript]].]]
The '''''Nagarakretagama''''' or '''''Nagarakrtagama''''', also known as '''''Desawarñana''''' or '''''Deshavarñana''''', is an [[Old Javanese]] [[eulogy]] to [[Hayam Wuruk]], a [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[king]] of the [[Majapahit Empire]].  It was written on [[Palm-leaf manuscript|lontar]] as a ''[[kakawin]]'' by [[Mpu Prapanca]] in 1365 (1287 [[Shalivahana era|Saka year]]).{{sfn|Cœdès|1968|pp=187,198,240}}{{sfn|Malkiel-Jirmounsky|1939|pp=59–68}}  The ''Nagarakretagama'' contains detailed descriptions of the Majapahit Empire during its greatest extent.  The poem affirms the importance of [[Hindu]]–[[Buddhism]] in the Majapahit empire by describing temples and palaces and several ceremonial observances.

==The manuscript==
In 1894, the [[Dutch East Indies]] launched a [[Dutch intervention in Lombok and Karangasem|military expedition against the Cakranegara royal house]] of [[Lombok]]. That year, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] took the [[manuscript]] as part of the valuable ''[[Dutch intervention in Lombok and Karangasem#Dutch reinforcements .28November 1894.29|Lombok treasure]]'', war-booty from the destroyed palace of [[Mataram (city)|Mataram]]-Cakranagara in Lombok.{{sfn|Ernawati|2007}}{{sfn|Day|Reynolds|2000}}  The first western scholar to study the manuscript was {{ill|Jan Laurens Andries Brandes|lt=J.L.A. Brandes|nl|Jan Laurens Andries Brandes}}, a Dutch [[philologist]]. He accompanied the [[KNIL]] expedition to Lombok in 1894, and is credited with saving the valuable manuscripts collection of the Lombok royal library from being burnt in the chaos of the battle. A generation of Dutch scholars participated in translating the poem.{{sfn|Malkiel-Jirmounsky|1939|pp=59–68}}

Much of its historical value was due to its having been the product of [[priest]]ly activities directed at enhancing the magical powers of the ruler at the time.{{sfn|Hall|1965}}  The manuscript is written on lontar leaves.  It was held in the library of [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands, with inventory code number L Or 5.023.

After its translation in the early 20th century, the ''Nagarakretagama'' became an inspiration and foundation of the [[Indonesian National Revival|Indonesian independence movement]].{{sfn|Guan|1998|p=6}}

In 1973 during the state visit of [[Queen Juliana]] to Indonesia, she returned the manuscript to Indonesia.  Today it is held by the [[National Library of Indonesia]], with inventory code number NB 9. In May 2008 [[UNESCO]] recognised the significance of the ''Nagarakretagama'' by naming it "The Memory of the World - Regional Register for Asia/Pacific",{{sfn|Kompas|2008}} and finally registered it in 2013.{{sfn|UNESCO|2013}}

==Descriptions of the Majapahit realm==
[[File:Majapahit Empire.svg|thumb|450px| The extent of Majapahit according to Nagarakretagama.]]

[[Historians]] have examined the poem for what it reveals of political history.  In the canto 13 to 14, the poet Prapanca named several states within today's [[Indonesia]]n borders. This suggested that those areas were within Majapahit spheres of influence.  Prapanca said the states were subsumed by Majapahit or were vassal states.{{sfn|Riana|2009}}

On the north side stood a beautiful gate with ornate iron door. To the east is the high stage, with stone-lined floor, white and shiny.

The manuscript describes the capital city of Majapahit. According to the account of Prapanca in the Nagarakretagama poem, the royal compound was surrounded by a thick, high wall of [[red brick]]. Nearby was the fortified guard post. The main gate into the palace was located in the north wall, and was entered through huge doors of decorated iron. Outside the north gate was a long building where courtiers met once a year, a market place, and a sacred crossroads. Just inside the north gate was a courtyard containing religious buildings. On the western side of this courtyard were pavilions surrounded by canals where people bathed. At the south end a gate led to rows of houses set on terraces in which palace servants lived. Another gate led to a third courtyard crowded with houses and a great hall for those waiting to be admitted into the ruler's presence. The king's own quarters, which lay to the east of this courtyard, had pavilions on decorated red brick bases, ornately carved wooden pillars, and a roof decorated with clay ornaments. Outside the palace were quarters for Shiva priests, Buddhists, and other members of the nobility. Further away, and separated from the palace by open fields, were more royal compounds, including that of the chief minister [[Gajah Mada]].

Took part also the smiths of ''dadaps'' (embossed coverings) of gold and silver, all of  them bestirring themselves the more in their respective customary occupations.

}}
In the poem, Prapanca recounted Hayam Wuruk's religious observances in the [[Candi of Indonesia#Candi of East Java|Candi Singhasari]], in which he entered the sanctuary and performed the ''puspa'' ceremony for his great-grandfather [[Kertanegara]]. After the visit, he went to Kagenengan to perform worship to the founder of the [[Singhasari kingdom]], [[Ken Arok|Rajasa]].{{sfn|Dowling|1992}}

The honoured holy ''puspa'' (flower effigy) was worked on with ''yoga'' (concentration); in the night was performed the eminent ''pratistha'' (placing) ceremony.
| salign = right
| source = ''Canto 64, stanza 5''.{{sfn|Pigeaud|1960|p=74}}
}}
Prapanca told details of the ''sraddha'' ceremony, performed to honour the soul of a deceased. He described specifically the ceremony for the Queen Grandmother's soul, [[Gayatri Rajapatni]], who had died twelve years earlier. In the canto 63, stanza 4, Prapanca narrated the preparation of the ceremony by the court artisans.  During the ceremony, lion thrones were erected, where priests placed a flower [[effigy]] (''puspa'') symbolising the soul of the Queen Grandmother. The descent of the soul to earth and its final placement in the ''puspa'' were narrated in canto 64, stanza 5.

The ceremony lasted for seven days. Colorful pageants crowded the main courtyard. The whole ceremony was performed to please the Rajapatni's soul in hopes that her favour would shine on the reign of her descendants. The posthumous ceremony continued and the king ordered the repair of the Kamal Pundak sanctuary to enact a new holy shrine (''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'') for the Queen Grandmother, deified as the ''[[Prajnaparamita]]''.{{sfn|Dowling|1992}}

==Characters and practices==
''Nagarakretagama'' was written as a ''puja sastra'', a genre of Old Javanese literature of adoration and reverence, directed mainly to King [[Hayam Wuruk]]. Prapanca did not shy away to expressed his admiration, even bordering somewhat a cult, since he often invoked a divine quality of the king and his royal family. Nevertheless, the work seems to be independent of court's patronage since Prapanca wrote them incognito after he retired from the court.&lt;ref name="Britannica-Majapahit"&gt;{{cite web | title = Indonesia, The Majapahit Era | work = Britannica | url = https://www.britannica.com/place/Indonesia/The-Majapahit-era}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the religious practices of the Majapahit royal family was the "royal walkabout".  They visited cornerstones of the empire and paid homage to the ancestors of the king. The poem also describes the death of Hayam Wuruk's most trusted regent, [[Gajah Mada]].{{sfn|Malkiel-Jirmounsky|1939|pp=59–68}}

The Queen Grandmother Rajapatni had a special place in Prapanca's poem. In one stanza, the poem describes the Queen Grandmother as ''chattra ning rat wisesa'' (the eminent protector of the world).{{sfn|Stutterheim|1938}} Rajapatni was the progenitor of the Majapahit kingdom, because she was the daughter of Kertanegara, the last king of the ''Singhasari'' kingdom, and she was also the wife of [[Raden Wijaya]], the founder of Majapahit.  Thus she was seen as the protector of the world.  The Queen Grandmother is said in the poem to embody the ''Pramabhagavati''; ''Bhagavati'' is another name of [[Prajnaparamita]] (the Goddess of Wisdom in [[Mahayana]]).

The poem portrays ''Kertanegara'' as a staunch [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], described as "submissive at the Feet of the Illustrious ''[[Shakya]]-Lion''".{{sfn|Pigeaud|1960|p=49}} Upon his death, the poem  describes the deification of Kertanegara in three forms: a splendid [[Tirthankara|Jina]], an [[Ardhanarishvara]],{{efn-lr |1 = Stutterheim believes that an ''[[ardhanari]]'' sculpture, now located in [[Berlin]], is a posthumous image of Kertanegara.{{sfn|Stutterheim|1952}} The image is half [[Shiva]] and half [[Visnu]], symbolising the unity of the two gods, the unity of the kingdom, and the oneness of the ''[[dharma]]''.}} and an imposing [[Shiva]]-Buddha.{{efn-lr | 1 = Note that Shiva-Buddha is a mixture of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]; no such image exists in [[India]].  In India, there is no deceased king in the guise of a god; he exists only in Indonesia.  Hindu and Buddhist images are intertwined in many old inscriptions and ''candi'' (temples or shrines).}}{{sfn|Dowling|1992}} Particularly for the Shiva–Buddha deity, Prapanca praises him as "the honoured Illustrious Protector of Mountains, Protector of the protectorless.  He is surely, Ruler over the rulers of the world".{{sfn|Pigeaud|1960|p=3}} The Shiva–Buddha deity is neither Shiva nor Buddha, but the Lord of the Mountains, or the Supreme God of the Realm.{{sfn|Supomo|1977}} This religious belief is indigenous to the [[Javanese people]] who combined the gods of two religions, [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], into the same God, the oneness of the ''[[dharma]]'', as is written in the ''[[Kakawin Sutasoma]]'' (see [[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]).  When Kertanegara was deified as Shiva–Buddha, he symbolised the collective powers of the God of the Realm.{{sfn|Dowling|1992}}

'''Our Lady of Pellevoisin''' is a series of [[Marian apparitions]] in [[Pellevoisin]], in the province of [[Berry (province)|Berry]], in the department of [[Indre (département)|Indre]],  [[France]]. It is west of [[Châteauroux]] in the Catholic [[Archdiocese of Bourges]].&lt;ref name="SNDMP"&gt;Sanctuaire Notre-Dame de Miséricorde – Pellevoisin. Brochure published by the shrine authorities at Pellevoisin, 2005. Printed by Imprimerie BEAU’LIEU Lyon.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

In 1876, a domestic servant, Estelle Faguette, claimed to receive a series of fifteen apparitions of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] and recovered from a serious illness, [[tuberculosis]]. In 1983, Archbishop Paul Vignancour of [[Bourges]] formally declared the cure to be inexplicable in the light of medical science and that her cure could rightly be regarded as a miracle by Catholics.

Following authorization by the Archbishop of Bourges in 1877, Estelle's bedroom was transformed into an oratory.&lt;ref name="urlSanctuaire Notre-Dame de Miséricorde de Pellevoisin | Sanctuaire Notre Dame de Miséricorde de Pellevoisin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pellevoisin.net/ |title=Sanctuaire Notre-Dame de Miséricorde de Pellevoisin &amp;#124; Sanctuaire Notre Dame de Miséricorde de Pellevoisin |format= |work= |accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pellevoisin rapidly became a place of pilgrimage, the shrine of Our Lady of Pellevoisin. The [[Catholic Church]] has never made a formal pronouncement on pilgrimages of the alleged apparitions, but [[Pope Leo XIII]] encouraged the pilgrimages by approving indulgences to pilgrims,&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|111}} and also approved related devotions to Our Lady.&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite book |last=Ball |first=Ann |date=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjI9YQBFDGYC&amp;pg=PA515#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=[[Huntington, Indiana]] |publisher=[[Our Sunday Visitor]] Publishing |page=515 |quote=The Confraternity of Our Lady of Pellevoisin was established, and Pope Leo XIII gave approbation both to the confraternity and to the scapular [of the Sacred Heart, associated with the apparition]. | isbn=9780879739102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinctive feature of the reported events of Pellevoisin is the request to use a [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]].

==Estelle Faguette==
[[File:Photograph of Estelle Faguette.jpg|thumb|Estelle Faguette]]
Estelle Faguette was born 12 September 1843 at [[Saint-Memmie]] near [[Châlons-sur-Marne]] and joined the [[Children of Mary]] at the age of 14. She entered an order of [[Augustinian]] [[religious sisters|nursing sisters]], but left while still a novice, she tripped and fell on a staircase; although the [[sprain]] seemed trivial at first, two weeks later, her leg was immobilised and doctors considered amputation. On 15 September 1863, Estelle reluctantly accepted that she could not pursue the life of a nursing sister and returned to her parents’ home.

==The apparitions==
At the time of the apparitions, Pellevoisin was the commercial centre for around a thousand citizens under the authority of the village mayor, Comte [[Duc de La Rochefoucauld|de la Rochefoucauld]]. His wife employed Estelle Faguette as a domestic servant and nursemaid at their residence near Pellevoisin, the Château de Poiriers-Montbel. A woman of fragile health, after numerous years in service, Estelle was dying of tuberculosis at the age of 33.&lt;ref name=Oconnell&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=4446|title=Our Lady of Pellevoisin at CatholicCulture.org |author=John O'Connell |date=2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813184622/http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=4446 |archivedate=2014-08-13 |accessdate=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With childlike faith, Estelle composed a letter to the Blessed Virgin Mary in which she asked for a cure. The letter was laid at the feet of a statue of the Virgin in Montbel, the summer chateau of the Rochefoucaulds, about 3&amp;nbsp;km from Pellevoisin.&lt;ref name="SNDMP" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

In February 1876, the Countess had to travel to Paris but arranged for accommodation to be made available for Estelle in a house close to the parish church in Pellevoisin. Unable to consume anything except liquids, Estelle received the sacrament of [[Extreme Unction]]. On 14 February, her physician judged that she had only hours left to live.&lt;ref name="SNDMP" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

During the night of that same day, Estelle reported experiencing the presence of the Virgin Mary for the first time, who told her that she must suffer for five more days in honour of the [[five wounds of Christ]]. At the end of the five days, Estelle would die or be cured; and if she lived, she would obliged to make known ‘Mary’s glory’.&lt;ref name="SWA"&gt;*{{citation |url=http://www.pellevoisin.net/node/102 |title=A Brief Account of the Apparitions |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813210310/http://www.pellevoisin.net/node/102 |archivedate=2014-08-13 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the following four nights the Blessed Virgin again appeared to Estelle. On Tuesday, she said: 'If my son grants you life, it will be a blessing for you.' On Wednesday, she said, 'I am all-merciful and the mistress of my Son. Your good deed, fervant prayers and little letter have touched my motherly heart'.&lt;ref name="SWA" /&gt;

[[File:Ex voto plaque placed in Pellevoisin by Estelle Faguette.jpg|thumb|left|Estelle Faguette commissioned and placed this plaque in Pellevoisin as a thanksgiving for her recovery from a grave illness.]]
On Friday night, Mary did not come and stand at the foot of the bed, as on the previous nights, but drew close to her. She showed Estelle the plaque which she must have placed as a thanksgiving, bearing the words: 'I called upon Mary in the depths of my misery. She obtained for me, from her Son, my complete cure.' The plaque was not plain white, but had a golden rose on each corner, and at the top, a heart on fire, crowned with roses, pierced by a sword. Indeed, on Saturday, Estelle was cured when she received [[Holy Communion]]. Immediately she was able to eat and drink normally, and within a few days, she resumed domestic and gardening duties with no sign of fatigue.

The next three apparitions occurred on three consecutive days in July, Saturday 1st - Monday 3rd. 'My son’s heart is so full of love that he will not refuse my demands. I have chosen this particular place for the conversion of sinners. I would like you to remain very peaceful about this!'&lt;ref name="SWA" /&gt;
{{The Sacred Heart}}

The Blessed Virgin returned in September (Saturday 9, Sunday 10, Friday 15). On 9 September, the lady drew attention to a small [[scapular]] she was wearing.&lt;ref name=Oconnell/&gt; Estelle had seen it there before, as plain white cloth, but on this day it bore the red image of a heart. 'This devotion pleases me', Mary said, and then,'It is here that I shall be honoured'.&lt;ref name="SWA" /&gt; The lady next appeared on 15 September, speaking of her concern for the [[Catholic Church in France]].

Three further visions followed in November (Wednesday 1, [[All Saints' Day]]; Sunday 5; Saturday 11). On 11 November, Estelle set about making a replica of the scapular which she had seen the lady wearing. On the last of these the Virgin told Estelle 'You have been working for me'.

The final and culminating vision took place on Friday 8 December 1876, the Solemnity of the [[Immaculate Conception]].&lt;ref name="SWA" /&gt;

;:I have many graces in store for those who wear this scapular with trust in me. These graces are my Son’s; I bring them from His Heart; he will refuse me nothing.&lt;ref name="SWA" /&gt; The lady asked her to show the scapular to the local bishop and ask his assistance in promoting it.

Estelle died in Pellevoisin on 23 August 1929, a few weeks short of her 87th birthday.&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|119}}

==Response of Catholic authorities==
Initial enquiries were carried out by Mgr de La Tour d'Auvergne, Archbishop of Bourges.&lt;ref name="EPN"&gt;{{cite book|author=Estelle Faguette|title=Pellevoisin: Estelle nous parle... : autobiographie et récit des quinze apparitions par la voyante|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjduXwAACAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Monastère des dominicaines}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|110}}

On 30 April 1876, with the permission of the Archbishop, she had an [[ex voto]] plaque of thanksgiving placed in the parish church. On December 8, her bedroom was transformed into an oratory. A few days later, the Archbishop received her for an interview and granted permission for her to make and distribute copies of the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]].&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|109}}

In 1877, he set up an enquiry and interviewed 56 persons who knew Estelle; apart from one who preferred not to comment, all spoke favourably. A second enquiry was conducted in December 1878, with similar results.&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|110}}

A [[confraternity]] of the All-merciful Mother was erected on 28 July 1877 but no mention was made of Pellevoisin in connection with its approval (but there was reference to St. [[Margaret Mary Alacoque]] was referred to).&lt;ref&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/p/pellevoisin-apparitions.php Stephey, Mark. "Who is Our Lady of Pellevoisin?", Marian Library, University of Dayton, September 20, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The statutes were approved on August 27.&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|109}}

In 1892, Pope [[Leo XIII]] offered two signs of favour to the shrine: awarding a candle, and declaring certain [[indulgences]] for pilgrims who visited it.&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|111}} On 8 May 1894, he raised the confraternity to the status of 'honorary Archconfraternity' and, on 12 May 1896, to 'effective Archconfraternity'.&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|112}} The Pope received her herself in audiences on 30 January and 17–18 February 1900, during which he agreed that the relevant Vatican department, the [[Congregation of Rites]], should consider authorising use of the Scapular of the Sacred Heart. Formal recognition was given on 4 April 1900.&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|112 &amp; 114}}

In 1893, Archbishop Boyer invited the [[Dominican Order|Dominican Friars]] to establish a monastery in a house close to her chapel.&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|113}}

In April 1897, Monsignor Servonnet became Archbishop of Bourges. The same year, on 14 October, he renewed permissions given by his predecessors for information about the shrine to be published. In 1899, following numerous petitions from France and Canada, he opened a third canonical enquiry, which again found her to be a credible witness.&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|113}}

On 16 April 1903, Madame de la Rochefoucauld, who still had administrative rights over the property containing the chapel which had been her bedroom, closed it to the public. The annual pilgrimage still took place on 9 September 1903 with a crowd gathering at the railings of the property; 40 police officers attended. On 19 July 1905, Archbishop Servonnet issued an order that crowds must not gather in front of the chapel.&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|115}}

On 17 October 1915, Pope [[Benedict XV]] commented that Our Lady had chosen Pellevoisin as a privileged place to dispense her graces.&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|117}}

On 22 December 1922, the [[Congregation of Rites]] authorised a [[votive Mass]] of Our Lady of Pellevoisin to be celebrated on 9 September in the parish church and adjoining monastery.&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|119}}

On 7 June 1936, by the hand of Cardinal Pacelli (later to become Pope [[Pius XII]]), [[Pius XI]] sent a painting of Our Lady of Pellevoisin as a gift to the Dominican community.&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|119}}

On 7 December 1981, Archbishop Paul Vignancour established a medical commission to examine the apparently miraculous cure. On 6 September 1982, having received its report that the cure was still inexplicable in the light of current medical science, the Archbishop established a theological commission to consider whether this cure might appropriately be called 'miraculous'. On 4 September 1983, while speaking at the annual pilgrimage to Pellevoisin, he announced the commission's findings that the cure had a 'miraculous character'. That was formally confirmed, in writing, on 8 September.&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|122,125,126}}

On 19 September 1984, an [[Imprimatur]] was granted for a novena to Our Lady of Pellevoisin.&lt;ref name="EPN" /&gt;{{rp|123}}

==Current shrine==
[[File:Shrine of Our Lady of Pellevoisin - Main House.JPG|thumb|The house in Pellevoisin, France, where domestic servant, Estelle Faguette, claimed to have received visions of the Virgin Mary. It is now a monastery of the Community of St. John.]]

The Shrine of Our Lady of Pellevoisin was under the care of the Dominicans for 105 years from 1895, but since 1998, it has been served by friars and sisters of the [[Community of St. John|Community of St Jean]]. A community of contemplative sisters form the Monastery of the Merciful Mother, and the friars form the Priory of St Mary Magdalen. The main spiritual activities are daily Mass at 11:30, a weekend celebrating God's mercy around the Second Sunday of Easter each year ([[Divine Mercy Sunday]] in the Roman Catholic Church) and the annual pilgrimage on the last weekend in August. Pilgrimages by groups and individuals are welcome throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.stjean.com/pellevoisin |title=Pellevoisin yesterday and today (Brothers of St John) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531210711/http://www.stjean.com/pellevoisin |archivedate=2013-05-31 |accessdate=2014-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation |url=http://www.catholique-bourges.cef.fr/communaute/religieuses/stjean.htm |title=Sœurs de Saint Jean (Diocese de Bourges) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612101722/http://catholique-bourges.cef.fr/communaute/religieuses/stjean.htm |archivedate=2010-06-12 |accessdate=2014-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mythology]], [[folklore]] and [[speculative fiction]], '''shapeshifting''' is the ability of a being or creature to transform its physical form or shape. This is usually achieved through an inherent ability of a mythological creature, divine intervention or the use of magic. The idea of shapeshifting is present in the oldest forms of [[totemism]] and [[shamanism]], as well as the oldest extant literature and [[epic poems]], including works such as the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' and the ''[[Iliad]]'', where the shapeshifting is usually induced by the act of a [[deity]].

The idea persisted through the [[Middle Ages]], where the agency causing shapeshifting is usually a sorcerer or witch, and into the modern period. It remains a common trope in modern [[fantasy]], [[children's literature]] and works of [[pop culture|popular culture]]. The most common form of shapeshifting myths is that of [[therianthropy]], which is the transformation of a human being into an animal or conversely, of an animal into human form. Legends allow for transformations into plants and objects and the assumption of another human [[Human physical appearance|countenance]] (e.g. fair to ugly).

==Folklore and mythology==
[[File:GermanWoodcut1722.jpg|thumb|right|1722 German woodcut of a [[werewolf]] transforming]]

Popular shapeshifting creatures in folklore are [[werewolf|werewolves]] and [[vampire]]s (mostly of [[Europe]]an, [[Canadians|Canadian]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]/early American origin), the [[huli jing]] of [[East Asia]] (including the [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] [[kitsune]] and [[Korean mythology|Korean]] [[kumiho]]), and the gods, [[goddess]]es, and [[demon]]s of numerous mythologies, such as the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Loki]] or the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Proteus]]. Shapeshifting to the form of a [[gray wolf|wolf]] is specifically known as [[lycanthropy]], and such creatures who undergo such change are called lycanthropes. [[Therianthropy]] is the more general term for human-animal shifts, but it is rarely used in that capacity. It was also common for [[deity|deities]] to transform mortals into animals and [[plant]]s.

Other terms for shapeshifters include metamorph, the Navajo [[skin-walker]], mimic, and '''[[therianthrope]]'''. The prefix "were-," coming from the Old English word for "man" (masculine rather than generic), is also used to designate shapeshifters; despite its root, it is used to indicate female shapeshifters as well.

While the popular idea of a shapeshifter is of a human being who turns into something else, there are numerous stories about animals that can transform themselves as well.&lt;ref name="endicott-studio.com"/&gt;

===Greco-Roman===
[[File:Gerbrand van den Eeckhout 005.jpg|right|thumb|[[Vertumnus]], in the form of an old woman, wooing [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]], by [[Gerbrand van den Eeckhout]].]]
Examples of shapeshifting in [[classical literature]] include many examples in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'', [[Circe]]'s transforming of [[Odysseus]]' men to pigs in [[Homer]]'s ''[[The Odyssey]]'', and [[Apuleius]]'s Lucius becoming a donkey in ''[[The Golden Ass]]''. [[Proteus]] was noted among the gods for his shapeshifting; both [[Menelaus]] and [[Aristaeus]] seized him to win information from him, and succeeded only because they held on during his various changes. [[Nereus]] told [[Heracles]] where to find the Apples of the [[Hesperides]] for the same reason.

The Titan [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], the first wife of Zeus and the mother of the goddess Athena, was believed to be able to change her appearance into anything she wanted. In one story, she was so proud, that her husband, Zeus, tricked her into changing into a fly. He then swallowed her because he feared that he and Metis would have a son who would be more powerful than Zeus himself. Metis, however, was already pregnant. She stayed alive inside his head and built armor for her daughter. The banging of her metalworking made Zeus have a headache, so Hephaestus clove his head with an axe. Athena sprang from her father's head, fully grown, and in battle armor.

[[File:Ler swans Millar.jpg|right|thumb|220px|The [[Children of Lir]], transformed into swans in Irish tales]]

In [[Greek mythology]], the transformation is often a punishment from the gods to humans who crossed them.
* [[Zeus]] transformed King [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]] and his children into wolves (hence [[Werewolf|lycanthropy]]) as a punishment for either killing Zeus' children or serving him the flesh of Lycaon's own murdered son [[Nyctimus]], depending on the exact version of the myth.
* [[Demeter]] transformed [[Ascalabus]] into a lizard for mocking her sorrow and thirst during her search for her daughter [[Persephone]]. She also turned King [[Lyncus]] into a [[lynx]] for trying to murder her prophet [[Triptolemus]].
* [[Athena]] transformed [[Arachne]] into a spider for challenging her as a weaver and/or weaving a tapestry that insulted the gods.
* [[Artemis]] transformed [[Actaeon]] into a stag for spying on her bathing, and he was later devoured by his own hunting dogs.
* [[Galanthis]] was transformed into a [[weasel]] or [[cat]] after interfering in [[Hera]]'s plans to hinder the birth of [[Heracles]].
* [[Atalanta]] and [[Hippomenes]] were turned into lions after making love in one of Zeus' temples.
* [[Io (mythology)|Io]] was a priestess of [[Hera]] in [[Argos]], a nymph who was raped by Zeus, who changed her into a [[Cow|heifer]] to escape detection.
* Hera punished young [[Tiresias]] by transforming him into a woman and, seven years later, back into a man.

While the Greek gods could use transformation punitively&amp;nbsp;– such as [[Medusa]], turned to a monster for having sexual intercourse with [[Poseidon]] in [[Athena]]'s temple&amp;nbsp;– even more frequently, the tales using it are of amorous adventure. [[Zeus]] repeatedly transformed himself to approach mortals as a means of gaining access:&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Dorson, "Foreword", p xxiv, Georgias A. Megas, ''Folktales of Greece'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Danaë]] as a shower of gold
* [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] as a bull
* [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] as a [[swan]]
* [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], as an [[eagle]]
* [[Alcmene]] as her husband [[Amphitryon]]
* [[Hera]] as a [[cuckoo]]
* [[Leto]] as a [[quail]]
* [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]] as a [[gopher]]
* [[Semele]] as a mortal shepherd
* [[Io (mythology)|Io]], as a cloud
* [[Nemesis (mythology)#Origins|Nemesis]] (Goddess of retribution) transformed into a goose to escape [[Zeus#Divine offspring|Zeus]]' advances, but he turned into a swan. She later bore the egg in which [[Helen of Troy#Birth|Helen of Troy]] was found.

[[Vertumnus]] transformed himself into an old woman to gain entry to [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]]'s orchard; there, he persuaded her to marry him.
[[File:Apollo and Daphne (Bernini).jpg|right|thumb|[[Gianlorenzo Bernini]], [[Apollo]] pursuing an unwilling [[Daphne]] who transforms into a laurel tree]]
In other tales, the woman appealed to other gods to protect her from [[rape]], and was transformed ([[Daphne]] into laurel, [[Cornix]] into a crow). Unlike Zeus and other gods' shapeshifting, these women were permanently metamorphosed.

In one tale, [[Demeter#Demeter and Poseidon|Demeter]] transformed herself into a mare to escape [[Poseidon#Lovers|Poseidon]], but Poseidon counter-transformed himself into a stallion to pursue her, and succeeded in the rape. [[Caeneus|Caenis]], having been raped by [[Poseidon]], demanded of him that she be changed to a man. He agreed, and she became [[Caeneus]], a form he never lost, except, in some versions, upon death.

As a final reward from the gods for their hospitality, [[Baucis and Philemon]] were transformed, at their deaths, into a pair of trees.

In some variants of the tale of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], he is turned into a [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]] flower.

After [[Tereus]] raped [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]] and cut out her tongue to silence her, she wove her story into a tapestry for her sister, Tereus's wife Procne, and the sisters murdered his son and fed him to his father. When he discovered this, he tried to kill them, but the gods changed them all into birds.
[[File:Cadmus teeth.jpg|right|thumb|"Cadmus Sowing the Dragon's Teeth" by [[Maxfield Parrish]]]]
Sometimes metamorphoses transformed objects into humans. In the myths of both [[Jason]] and [[Cadmus]], one task set to the hero was to sow [[Dragon's teeth (mythology)|dragon's teeth]]; on being sown, they would metamorphose into belligerent warriors, and both heroes had to throw a rock to trick them into fighting each other to survive. [[Deucalion]] and [[Pyrrha]] repopulated the world after a flood by throwing stones behind them; they were transformed into people. [[Cadmus]] is also often known to have transformed into a dragon or serpent towards the end of his life. [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] fell in love with [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]], a statue he had made. [[Aphrodite]] had pity on him and transformed the stone to a living woman.

===British and Irish===
[[Fairy|Fairies]], [[witch]]es, and [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizards]] were all noted for their shapeshifting ability. Not all fairies could shapeshift, and some were limited to changing their size, as with the [[spriggan]]s, and others to a few forms and other fairies might have only the appearance of shapeshifting, through their power, called "glamour," to create illusions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Katharine Mary Briggs|Katharine Briggs]], ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures,'' "Glamour", p. 191. {{ISBN|0-394-73467-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; But others, such as the [[The Hedley Kow|Hedley Kow]], could change to many forms, and both human and supernatural wizards were capable of both such changes, and inflicting them on others.&lt;ref name="Fairies, Hobgoblins p360"/&gt;

Witches could turn into hares and in that form steal milk and butter.&lt;ref&gt;Eddie Lenihan and Carolyn Eve Green, ''Meeting The Other Crowd: The Fairy Stories of Hidden Ireland'', p. 80 {{ISBN|1-58542-206-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many British fairy tales, such as ''[[Jack the Giant Killer]]'' and ''[[The Black Bull of Norroway]]'', feature shapeshifting.

====Celtic mythology====
[[Pwyll]] was transformed by [[Arawn]] into Arawn's own shape, and Arawn transformed himself into Pwyll's, so that they could trade places for a year and a day.

[[Llwyd ap Cil Coed]] transformed his wife and attendants into mice to attack a crop in revenge; when his wife is captured, he turned himself into three clergymen in succession to try to pay a ransom.

[[Math ap Mathonwy|Math]] and [[Gwydion]] transform flowers into a woman named [[Blodeuedd|Blodeuwedd]], and when she betrays her husband [[Lleu]], who is transformed into an eagle, they transform her again, into an owl.

[[Gilfaethwy]] committed rape with help from his brother [[Gwydion]]. Both were transformed into animals, for one year each. Gwydion was transformed into a stag, sow and wolf, and Gilfaethwy into a hind, boar and she-wolf. Each year, they had a child. Math turned the three young animals into boys.

[[Taliesin|Gwion]], having accidentally taken some of wisdom potion that [[Ceridwen]] was brewing for her son, fled her through a succession of changes that she answered with changes of her own, ending with his being eaten, a grain of corn, by her as a hen. She became pregnant, and he was reborn in a new form, as Taliesin.

Tales abound about the [[selkie]], a seal that can remove its skin to make contact with humans for only a short amount of time before it must return to the sea. Clan MacColdrum of Uist's foundation myths include of a union between the founder of the clan and a shapeshifting [[selkie]].&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Highlanders and Native Americans: indigenous education in the eighteenth-century Atlantic world Margaret Szasz 2007 University of Oklahoma Press&lt;/ref&gt; Another such creature is the Scottish [[selkie]], which needs its sealskin to regain its form. In ''[[The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry]]'' the (male) selkie seduces a human woman. Such stories surrounding these creatures are usually romantic tragedies.

[[Scottish mythology]] features shapeshifters, which allows the various creatures to trick, deceive, hunt, and kill humans.  Water spirits such as the [[each uisge]], which inhabit lochs and waterways in Scotland, were said to appear as a horse or a young man.&lt;ref name="Fairies, Hobgoblins p360"&gt;[[Katharine Mary Briggs|Katharine Briggs]], ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures,'' "Shape-shifting", p360. {{ISBN|0-394-73467-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other tales include [[kelpie]]s who emerge from lochs and rivers in the disguise of a horse or woman in order to ensnare and kill weary travelers. [[Tam Lin]], a man captured by the Queen of the Fairies is changed into all manner of beasts before being rescued. He finally turned into a burning coal and was thrown him into a well, whereupon he reappeared in his human form. The motif of capturing a person by holding him through all forms of [[Transformation chase|transformation]] is a common thread in [[Folklore|folktale]]s.&lt;ref name="Francis James Child pp. 336"/&gt;

Perhaps the best known [[Irish mythology|Irish]] myth is that of [[Aoife]] who turned her stepchildren, the [[Children of Lir]], into swans to be rid of them. Likewise in the [[Wooing of Etain]] [[Fuamnach]] jealously turns [[Étaín]] into a butterfly. The most dramatic example of shapeshifting in Irish myth is that of [[Tuan mac Cairill]], the only survivor of [[Partholón]]'s settlement of Ireland. In his centuries long life he became successively a stag, a wild boar, a hawk and finally a salmon prior to being eaten and (as in the Wooing of Étaín) reborn as a human.

The [[Púca]] is a Celtic faery, and also a deft shapeshifter. He can transform into many different, terrifying forms.

[[Sadhbh]], the wife of the famous hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] was changed into a deer by the druid Fer Doirich.

===Norse===
In the [[Lokasenna]], [[Odin]] and [[Loki]] taunt each other with having taken the form of females and nursing offspring to which they had given birth. A 13th century [[Edda]] relates Loki taking the form of a [[mare (horse)|mare]] to bear Odin's steed [[Sleipnir]] which was the fastest horse ever to exist, and also the form of a she-wolf to bear [[Fenrir]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Svipdagr]] angered [[Odin]], who turned him into a dragon. Despite his monstrous appearance, his lover, the goddess [[Freyja]], refused to leave his side. When the warrior Hadding found and slew Svipdag, Freyja cursed him to be tormented by a tempest and shunned like the plague wherever he went. In the ''[[Hyndluljóð]]'', Freyja transformed her protégé [[Óttar (mythology)|Óttar]] into a boar to conceal him. She also possessed a cloak of falcon feathers that allowed her to transform into a falcon, which Loki borrowed on occasion.

The [[Volsunga saga]] contains many shapeshifting characters. [[Siggeir]]'s mother changed into a wolf to help torture his defeated brothers-in-law with slow and ignominious deaths. When one, [[Sigmund]], survived, he and his nephew and son [[Sinfjötli]] killed men wearing wolfskins; when they donned the skins themselves, they were cursed to become [[werewolf|werewolves]].

The dwarf [[Andvari]] is described as being able to magically turn into a [[Esox|pike]]. [[Alberich]], his counterpart in [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', using the [[Tarnhelm]], takes on many forms, including a giant serpent and a toad, in a failed attempt to impress or intimidate Loki and Odin/[[Wōden|Wotan]].

[[Fafnir]] was originally a dwarf, a giant or even a human, depending on the exact myth, but in all variants he transformed into a dragon—a symbol of [[Greed (deadly sin)|greed]]—while guarding his ill-gotten hoard. His brother, [[Ótr]], enjoyed spending time as an otter, which led to his accidental slaying by Loki.

In [[Scandinavia]], there existed, for example, the famous race of she-werewolves known with a name of Maras, women who took on the appearance of the night looking for huge monster half human and half wolf. If a female at midnight stretches the membrane which envelopes the foal when it is brought forth, between four sticks and creeps through it, naked, she will bear children without pain; but all the boys will be [[shaman]]s, and all the girls Maras.

The [[Tomte|Nisse]] is sometimes said to be a shapeshifter. This trait also is attributed to [[Huldra]].

[[Gunnhild, Mother of Kings]] (''Gunnhild konungamóðir'') (c. 910 &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp; c. 980), a quasi-historical figure who appears in the [[Icelandic Sagas]], according to which she was the wife of [[Eric Bloodaxe]], was credited with magic powers - including the power of shapeshifting 
and turning at will into a bird. She is the central character of the novel ''[[Mother of Kings]]'' by [[Poul Anderson]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Tor Books]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which considerably elaborates on her shapeshifting  abilities.

===Other lore===
In [[Poland]], in the parish church of [[Schwarzenstein]], hang two horse-shoes related to the story of the tavern-keeper of [[Eichmedian]]. A greedy woman, she charged double the honest rate for board and lodging. Late one evening, a group of guests accused her of cheating them. Defending herself, she swore an oath before them, saying: "If my business is not just, then ride my back the Devil must!"

The room suddenly darkened and the Devil suddenly appeared before her. He gestured, and unable to resist, she knelt on all fours and found herself changing into a bay mare. The Devil mounted, gave a great laugh and rode her out of the village. At headlong speed he rode to the town of Schwarzenstein, and to a blacksmith's shop there, arriving in the small hours of the morning. He roused the blacksmith and demanded that his steed be shod at once. The blacksmith, yawning, complained of the late hour and that his forge was shut down and cold. But the Devil insisted and promised gold if it were done swiftly, and so the blacksmith agreed. He lit his furnace, and had the Devil work the bellows. The blacksmith had not long begun his work however when the mare began to speak, evidently having worked out how to form human words with her equine lips. "Don't you know me?" she begged. "It is I, the tavern-keeper of Eichmedian!" The blacksmith was horrified and nothing could persuade him to continue with the shoeing. The Devil raged but there was nothing he could do, and as a cock heralded the arrival of dawn, the spell was broken. The Devil vanished and the tavern-keeper returned to her human form. Repenting of her greedy ways, she had the two horse-shoes which the smith had already fashioned nailed up in the church as a warning to other cheats.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

====Armenian====
In [[Armenian mythology]], shapeshifters include the ''Nhang'', a serpent-like river monster than can transform itself into a woman or seal, and will drown humans and then drink their blood; or the beneficial ''Shahapet'', a guardian spirit that can appear either as a man or a snake.&lt;ref name="Armmyth"&gt;[http://bulfinch.englishatheist.org/armenian/chapter11.htm "Armenian Mythology"] by Mardiros H. Ananikiam, in ''Bullfinch's Mythology''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian====
Ancient Indian mythology tells of [[Nāga]], snakes that can sometimes assume human form. Scriptures describe shapeshifting [[Rakshasa]] (demons) assuming animal forms to deceive humans. The ''Ramayana'' also includes the [[Vanara]], a group of ape-like humanoids who possessed supernatural powers and could change their shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Vanamali, Mataji Devi (2010).

In the Indian fable ''[[The Dog Bride]]'' from [[Folklore of the Santal Parganas]] by [[Cecil Henry Bompas]], a buffalo herder falls in love with a dog that has the power to turn into a woman when she bathes.

====Philippines====
[[Philippine mythology]] includes ''[[aswang]]'', a vampire-like monster capable of transforming itself into either a large black dog or a black boar in order to stalk humans at night.  The folklore also mentions other beings such as ''kapre'', ''tikbalang'', and ''engkanto'', which change their appearances to woo beautiful maidens.  Also, talismans (called "''anting-anting''" or "''birtud''" in the local dialect), can give their owners the ability to shapeshift.  In one tale, ''Chonguita the Monkey Wife'',&lt;ref&gt;Fansler, Dean s.; ''[[Filipino Popular Tales]]'';&lt;/ref&gt; a woman is turned into a monkey, only becoming human again if she can marry a handsome man.

====Tatar====
[[Tatarstan|Tatar]] folklore includes [[Yuxa]], a hundred-year-old snake that can transform itself into a beautiful young woman, and seeks to marry men in order to have children.

[[File:Legend white snake1.jpg|right|thumb|"Madame White Snake" Picture on long veranda in the [[Summer Palace]], Beijing, China]]

====Chinese====
[[Chinese mythology]] contains many tales of animal shapeshifters, capable of taking on human form. The most common such shapeshifter is the [[huli jing]], a fox spirit which usually appears as a beautiful young woman; most are dangerous, but some feature as the heroines of love stories. ''[[Madame White Snake]]'' is one such legend; a snake falls in love with a man, and the story recounts the trials that she and her husband faced.

====Japanese====
[[File:Kuniyoshi Kuzunoha.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Kuzunoha]] the fox woman, casting a fox shadow]]
In [[Japanese folklore]] [[obake|ōbake]] are a type of [[yōkai]] with the ability to shapeshift. The fox, or [[Kitsune#Folklore|kitsune]] is among the most commonly known, but other such creatures include the [[bakeneko]], the [[mujina]] and the [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]].

====Korean====
[[Korean mythology]] also contains a fox with the ability to shapeshift. Unlike its Chinese and Japanese counterparts, the [[kumiho]] is always malevolent. Usually its form is of a beautiful young woman; one tale recounts a man, a would-be seducer, revealed as a kumiho.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Insu Fenkl, "[http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrFoxTale.html A Fox Woman Tale of Korea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111095533/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrFoxTale.html |date=2006-11-11 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; The kumiho has nine tails and as she desires to be a full human, she uses her beauty to seduce men and eat their hearts (or in some cases livers where the belief is that 100 livers would turn her into a real human).

====Somali====
In [[Somali mythology]] ''Qori ismaris'' ("One who rubs himself with a stick") was a man who could transform himself into a "[[Werehyena|Hyena-man]]" by rubbing himself with a magic stick at nightfall and by repeating this process could return to his human state before dawn.

====Trinidad and Tobago====
The [[Lagahoo|Ligahoo]] or [[loup-garou]] is the shapeshifter of [[Caribbean folklore|Trinidad and Tobago's folklore]]. This unique ability is believed to be handed down in some old [[Creole peoples|creole]] families, and is usually associated with [[Witch doctor|witch-doctors]] and practitioners of [[African magic]].&lt;ref&gt;

====Mapuche (Argentina and Chile)==== 
The name of the [[Nahuel Huapi Lake]] in Argentina derives from the toponym of its major island in [[Mapudungun]] ([[Mapuche]] language): "Island of the Jaguar (or Puma)", from ''nahuel'', "puma (or jaguar)", and ''huapí'', "island". There is, however, more to the word "Nahuel" - it can also signify "a man who by [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] has been transformed into a puma" (or jaguar).

==Themes==
Shapeshifting may be used as a [[plot device]], such as when [[Puss in Boots]] in the fairy tales tricks the [[ogre]] into becoming a mouse to be eaten. Shapeshifting may also include symbolic significance, like the Beast's transformation in ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' indicates Belle's ability to accept him despite his appearance.{{sfnp|Wilson|1976|p=94}}

{{Original research section|date=July 2014}}
When a form is taken on involuntarily, the thematic effect can be one of confinement and restraint; the person is ''bound'' to the new form. In extreme cases, such as [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrifaction]], the character is entirely disabled. On the other hand, voluntary shapeshifting can be a means of escape and liberation. Even when the form is not undertaken to resemble a literal escape, the abilities specific to the form allow the character to act in a manner that was previously impossible.

Examples of this are in [[fairy tale|fairy tales.]] A prince who is forced into a bear's shape (as in ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'') is a prisoner, but a princess who takes on a bear's shape voluntarily to flee a situation (as in ''[[The She-Bear]]'') escapes with her new shape.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], ''From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales And Their Tellers'', p. 353 {{ISBN|0-374-15901-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Earthsea]] books, [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] depicts an animal form as slowly transforming the wizard's mind, so that the dolphin, bear or other creature forgets it was human, making it impossible to change back. This makes an example for a voluntary shapeshifting becoming an imprisoning metamorphosis.{{sfnp|Colbert|2001|pp=28–29}}
Beyond this, the uses of shapeshifting, transformation, and [[metamorphosis]] in fiction are as [[protean]] as the forms the characters take on. Some are rare, such as [[Italo Calvino]]'s "[[The Canary Prince]]" is a [[Rapunzel]] variant in which shapeshifting is used to gain access to the tower.

===Punitive changes===
In many cases, imposed forms are punitive in nature. This may be a just punishment, the nature of the transformation matching the crime for which it occurs; in other cases, the form is unjustly imposed by an angry and powerful person. In fairy tales, such transformations are usually temporary, but they commonly appear as the [[Falling action|resolution]] of myths (as in many of the [[Metamorphoses]]) or produce [[origin myth]]s.
[[File:Svipdag transformed - John Bauer.jpg|right|thumb|"Svipdag transformed" by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]]]

===Transformation chase===
In many [[fairy tale]]s and [[ballad]]s, as in [[Child Ballads|Child Ballad]] #44, ''[[The Twa Magicians]]'' or ''[[Farmer Weathersky]]'', a magical chase occurs where the pursued endlessly takes on forms in an effort to shake off the pursuer, and the pursuer answers with other shapeshifting, as, a dove is answered with a hawk, and a hare with a greyhound. The pursued may finally succeed in escape or the pursuer in capturing.

The Grimm Brothers fairy tale ''[[Foundling-Bird]]'' contains this as the bulk of the plot.&lt;ref name="Vladimir Propp p. 57"&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p. 57, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Italian Campania Fables collection of ''[[Pentamerone]]'' by [[Gianbattista Basile]], tells of a Neapolitan princess who, to escape from her father who had imprisoned her, becomes in a huge she-bear. The magic happens due to a potion given to her by an old witch. The girl, once gone, can regain her human aspect.

In other variants, the pursued may transform various objects into obstacles, as in the fairy tale "[[The Master Maid]]", where the Master Maid transforms a wooden comb into a forest, a lump of salt into a mountain, and a flask of water into a sea. In these tales, the pursued normally escapes after overcoming [[Rule of three (writing)|three]] obstacles.&lt;ref name="Vladimir Propp p 57"&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p 57, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This obstacle chase is literally found worldwide, in many variants in every region.&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, The Folktale, p. 56, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

In fairy tales of the [[Aarne–Thompson]] type 313A, The Girl Helps the Hero Flee, such a chase is an integral part of the tale. It can be either a transformation chase (as in ''[[The Grateful Prince]]'', ''[[King Kojata]]'', ''[[Foundling-Bird]]'', ''[[Jean, the Soldier, and Eulalie, the Devil's Daughter]]'', or ''[[The Two Kings' Children]]'') or an obstacle chase (as in ''[[The Battle of the Birds]]'', ''[[The White Dove (Danish fairy tale)|The White Dove]]'', or ''[[The Master Maid]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p. 89, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar effect, a captive may shapeshift in order to break a hold on him. [[Proteus]] and [[Nereus]]'s shapeshifting was to prevent heroes such as [[Menelaus]] and [[Heracles]] from forcing information from them.{{sfnp|Colbert|2001|p=23}} [[Tam Lin]], once seized by Janet, was transformed by the [[faeries]] to keep Janet from taking him, but as he had advised her, she did not let go, and so freed him.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Transformation", p 960 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motif of capturing a person by holding him through many transformations is found in folktales throughout Europe,&lt;ref name="Francis James Child pp. 336"&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, pp. 336–7, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Patricia A. McKillip]] references it in her ''[[The Riddle Master Trilogy#The Riddle-Master trilogy|Riddle-Master trilogy]]'': a shapeshifting Earthmaster finally wins its freedom by startling the man holding it.

===Powers===
One motif is a shape change in order to obtain abilities in the new form. [[Berserkers]] were held to change into wolves and bears in order to fight more effectively. In many cultures, evil magicians could transform into animal shapes and thus skulk about.

In many fairy tales, the hero's [[talking animal]] [[donor (fairy tale)|helper]] proves to be a shapeshifted human being, able to help him in its animal form. In one variation, featured in ''[[The Three Enchanted Princes]]'' and ''[[The Death of Koschei the Deathless]]'', the hero's three sisters have been married to animals. These prove to be shapeshifted men, who aid their brother-in-law in a variant of tale types.&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', pp. 55–6, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[Maya script#History|early Mayan]] text, the Shapeshifter, or Mestaclocan, has the ability to change his appearance and to manipulate the minds of animals. In one tale, the Mestaclocan finds a dying eagle. Changing into the form of an eagle, he convinces the dying bird that it is, in fact, not dying. As the story goes they both soar into the heavens, and lived together for eternity.

===Bildungsroman===
[[File:Anne Anderson05.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', by [[Anne Anderson (illustrator)|Anne Anderson]]]]
''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' has been interpreted as a young woman's coming-of-age, in which she changes from being repulsed by sexual activity and regarding a husband therefore bestial, to a mature woman who can marry.{{sfnp|Jones|1995|p=84}}

===Needed items===
[[File:Valkyries with swan skins.jpg|right|thumb|[[Valkyries]] as swan maidens, having shed their swan skins.]]

Some shapeshifters are able to change form only if they have some item, usually an article of clothing. In ''[[Bisclavret]]'' by [[Marie de France]], a werewolf cannot regain human form without his clothing, but in wolf form does no harm to anyone. The most common use of this motif, however, is in tales where a man steals the article and forces the shapeshifter, trapped in human form, to become his bride. This lasts until she discovers where he has hidden the article, and she can flee. Selkies feature in these tales. Others include [[swan maiden]]s and the Japanese ''[[tennin]]''.

===Inner conflict===
The power to externally transform can symbolize an internal savagery; a central theme in many strands of [[werewolf]] mythology,{{sfnp|Steiger|1999|p=xix}} and the [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde#Analysis|inversion of the "liberation" theme]], as in [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde#Plot|Dr Jekyll's transformation]] into Mr. Hyde.

===Usurpation===
[[File:Vasnetsov Alenushka.jpg|right|thumb|''Sister Alenushka Weeping about Brother Ivanushka'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], Russian variant of ''Brother and Sister'': Alenushka laments her brother's transformation into a goat.]]

Some transformations are performed to remove the victim from his place, so that the transformer can usurp it. [[Bisclaveret]]'s wife steals his clothing and traps him in wolf form because she has a lover. A witch, in ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]'', changed a mother into a sheep to take her place, and had the mother slaughtered; when her stepdaughter married the king, the witch transformed her into a reindeer so as to put her daughter in the queen's place. In the Korean ''Transformation of the Kumiho'', a [[kumiho]], a fox with magical powers, transformed itself into an image of the bride, only being detected when her clothing is removed. In ''[[Brother and Sister]]'', when two children flee their cruel stepmother, she enchants the streams along the way to transform them. While the brother refrains from the first two, which threaten to turn them into tigers and wolves, he is too thirsty at the third, which turns him into a deer. ''[[The Six Swans]]'' are transformed into swans by their [[Stepmother#In fiction|stepmother]],{{sfnp|Tatar|2004|p=226}} as are the Children of Lir in Irish mythology.

===Ill-advised wishes===
Many fairy-tale characters have expressed ill-advised [[wish]]es to have any child at all, even one that has another form, and had such children born to them.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''Off with Their Heads!'' p. 60 {{ISBN|0-691-06943-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the fairy tale, normally after marriage, such children metamorphose into human form. ''[[Hans My Hedgehog]]'' was born when his father wished for a child, even a hedgehog. Even stranger forms are possible: [[Giambattista Basile]] included in his ''Pentamerone'' the [[The Myrtle|tale]] of a girl born as a sprig of myrtle, and [[Italo Calvino]], in his ''Italian Folktales'', a girl born as an apple.

Sometimes, the parent who wishes for a child is told how to gain one, but does not obey the directions perfectly, resulting in the transformed birth. In ''[[Lindworm#In tales|Prince Lindworm]]'', the woman eats two onions, but does not peel one, resulting in her first child being a [[lindworm]]. In ''[[Tatterhood]]'', a woman magically produces two flowers, but disobeys the directions to eat only the beautiful one, resulting her having a beautiful and sweet daughter, but only after a disgusting and hideous one.

Less commonly, ill-advised wishes can transform a person after birth. ''[[The Seven Ravens]]'' are transformed when their father thinks his sons are playing instead of fetching water to christen their newborn and sickly sister, and curses them.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 136 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Puddocky]]'', when three princes start to quarrel over the beautiful heroine, a witch curses her because of the noise.

===Monstrous bride/bridegroom===
Such wished-for children may become monstrous [[bride]]s or [[bridegroom]]s. These tales have often been interpreted as symbolically representing arranged marriages; the bride's revulsion to marrying a stranger being symbolized by his bestial form.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''Off with Their Heads!'' pp. 140–141 {{ISBN|0-691-06943-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heroine must fall in love with the transformed groom. The hero or heroine must marry, as promised, and the monstrous form is removed by the wedding. [[Sir Gawain]] thus transformed the [[Loathly lady]]; although he was told that this was half-way, she could at his choice be beautiful by day and hideous by night, or vice versa, he told her that he would choose what she preferred, which broke the spell entirely.{{sfnp|Wilson|1976|p=89}} In ''[[Tatterhood]]'', Tatterhood is transformed by her asking her bridegroom why he didn't ask her why she rode a goat, why she carried a spoon, and why she was so ugly, and when he asked her, denying it and therefore transforming her goat into a horse, her spoon into a fan, and herself into a beauty. [[Puddocky]] is transformed when her prince, after she had helped him with two other tasks, tells him that his father has sent him for a bride. A similar effect is found in [[Child ballad]] 34, ''[[Kemp Owyne]]'', where the hero can transform a dragon back into a maiden by kissing her three times.{{sfnp|Child|1965|p=306}}

Sometimes the bridegroom removes his animal skin for the wedding night, whereupon it can be burned. ''[[Hans My Hedgehog]]'', ''[[The Donkey (fairy tale)|The Donkey]]'' and ''[[The Pig King]]'' fall under this grouping. At an extreme, in ''[[Lindworm#In tales|Prince Lindworm]]'', the bride who avoids being eaten by the lindworm bridegroom arrives at her wedding wearing every gown she owns, and she tells the bridegroom she will remove one of hers if he removes one of his; only when her last gown comes off has he removed his last skin, and become a white shape that she can form into a man.&lt;ref name="endicott-studio.com"&gt;[[Terri Windling]], "[http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrMarriedToMagic.html Married to Magic: Animal Brides and Bridegrooms in Folklore and Fantasy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111101830/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrMarriedToMagic.html |date=2006-11-11 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

In some tales, the hero or heroine must obey a prohibition; the bride must spend a period of time not seeing the transformed groom in human shape (as in ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]''), or the bridegroom must not burn the animals' skins. In ''[[The Brown Bear of Norway]]'', ''[[The Golden Crab]]'', ''[[The Enchanted Snake]]'' and some variants of ''[[The Frog Princess]]'', burning the skin is a catastrophe, putting the transformed bride or bridegroom in danger. In these tales, the prohibition is broken, invariably, resulting in a separation and a search by one spouse for the other.&lt;ref name="endicott-studio.com"/&gt;

===Death===
Ghosts sometimes appear in animal form. In ''[[The Famous Flower of Serving-Men]]'', the heroine's murdered husband appears to the king as a white dove, lamenting her fate over his own grave. In ''[[The White and the Black Bride]]'' and ''[[The Three Little Men in the Wood]]'', the murdered&amp;nbsp;– drowned&amp;nbsp;– true bride reappears as a white duck. In ''[[The Rose Tree]]'' and ''[[The Juniper Tree (fairy tale)|The Juniper Tree]]'', the murdered children become birds who avenge their own deaths. There are African folk tales of murder victims avenging themselves in the form of [[Mugger crocodile|crocodiles]] that can shapeshift into human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=67 |title= The Werewolf Book: The Encyclopedia of Shape-Shifting Beings |first=B. |last=Steiger |isbn=978-1-57859-078-0 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some fairy tales, the character can reveal himself in every new form, and so a usurper repeatedly kills the victim in every new form, as in ''[[Beauty and Pock Face]]'', ''[[A String of Pearls Twined with Golden Flowers]]'', and ''[[The Boys with the Golden Stars]]''. This eventually leads to a form in which the character (or characters) can reveal the truth to someone able to stop the villain.

Similarly, the transformation back may be acts that would be fatal. In ''[[The Wounded Lion]]'', the prescription for turning the lion back into a prince was to kill him, chop him to pieces, burn the pieces, and throw the ash into water. Less drastic but no less apparently fatal, the fox in ''[[The Golden Bird]]'', the foals in ''[[The Seven Foals]]'', and the cats in ''[[Lord Peter (fairy tale)|Lord Peter]]'' and ''[[The White Cat (fairy tale)|The White Cat]]'' tell the heroes of those stories to cut off their heads; this restores them to human shape.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', pp. 174–5, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Greek tale of [[Scylla (princess)|Scylla]], Scylla's father [[Nisos|Nisus]] turns into an eagle after death and drowns her daughter for betraying her father.

===Fiction===
* In [[George MacDonald]]'s ''[[The Princess and Curdie]]'' (1883) Curdie is informed that many human beings, by their acts, are slowly turning into beasts. Curdie is given the power to detect the transformation before it is visible, and is assisted by beasts that had been transformed and are working their way back to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Prickett, ''Victorian Fantasy'' p. 86 {{ISBN|0-253-17461-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[L. Frank Baum]] concluded ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'' (1904) with the revelation that [[Princess Ozma]], sought by the protagonists, had been turned into a boy as a baby, and that Tip (who had been searching for her) is that boy.

* In [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] novels, [[Sauron]], the main antagonist of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is a shapeshifter. Initially he can appear in any number of beautiful forms to deceive the gullible; and thus he makes the Rings of Power with the service of the Elves who are deceived by his appearance. In the First Age of the Sun (detailed in the [[Silmarillion]]) he could take on numerable forms; during his battle with Huan, the wolfhound, he takes on no less than five forms, including a gigantic werewolf, but succumbs and flees in the form of a vampire. When the island of Númenor is destroyed, Sauron loses his shapeshifting powers and is stuck in his dark hideous form and thus his enemies are no longer deceived. Aside from Sauron, many other Maiar in Middle-earth can shapeshift. The Valar shapeshift depending on their moods.
* In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the prequel to ''The Lord of the Rings'', the character [[Beorn]] is normally a large human, but can shapeshift into a large [[bear]].

* A [[Face Dancer]] is a type of human in [[Frank Herbert]]'s science fiction [[Dune]] universe. A servant caste of the [[Bene Tleilax]], Face Dancers are shapeshifters, and their name is derived from their ability to change their physical appearance at will. Originally, Face Dancers were Tleilaxu trained to mimic others using acting and makeup, enhanced by plastic surgery. As time went on, the Tleilaxu began to use genetic manipulation to enhance natural ability in phenotypic plasticity, so that Face Dancers could change height, increase and decrease apparent mass, change coloring and texture, and change facial features.

Sennett, "Worthy of a Better God" p. 243 Gregory Bassham ed. and Jerry L. Walls, ed. ''The Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy'' {{ISBN|0-8126-9588-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eustace's transformation is not strictly a punishment – the change simply reveals the truth of his selfishness. It is reversed after he repents and his moral nature changes. Rabadash is allowed to reverse his transformation, providing he does so in a public place, so that his former followers will know that he had been a donkey. He is warned that, if he ever leaves his capital city again, he will become a donkey permanently, and this prevents him leading further military campaigns.

'''Shia Islam''' are the two major [[Islamic schools and branches|denominations of Islam]]. They chose sides following the death of the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] in AD 632. A dispute over [[succession to Muhammad|succession to Islamic prophet Muhammad]] as a [[caliph]] of the [[Ummah|Islamic community]] spread across various parts of the world, which led to the [[Battle of Jamal]] and [[Battle of Siffin]]. The dispute intensified greatly after the [[Battle of Karbala]], in which [[Hussein ibn Ali-A]] and his household were killed by the ruling Umayyad Caliph [[Yazid I|Yazid&amp;nbsp;I]], and the outcry for revenge divided the early Islamic community.

The present demographic breakdown between the two denominations is difficult to assess and varies by source, but [[List of countries by Muslim population|a good approximation]] is that 85% of the world's [[Muslim]]s are Sunni&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewforum.org/Muslim/Mapping-the-Global-Muslim-Population.aspx |title=Mapping the Global Muslim Population: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Muslim Population |accessdate=2010-08-24 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |quote=Of the total Muslim population, 15% are [[Shia]] Muslims and 90% are Sunni Muslims. |date=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 10% are [[Shia]],&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2122.html |title=Religions |work=[[CIA World Factbook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2009/10/07/mapping-the-global-muslim-population/ |title=Mapping the Global Muslim Population |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |date=7 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with most Shias belonging to the [[Twelver]] tradition and the rest divided between many other groups.&lt;ref name=cia /&gt; Sunnis are a majority in most Muslim communities: in [[Southeast Asia]], [[China]], [[South Asia]], [[Africa]], and most of the [[Arab world]].

Today, there are differences in religious practice, traditions, and customs, often related to [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]]. Although all Muslim groups consider the [[Quran]] to be divine, Sunni and Shia have different opinions on [[hadith]].

In recent years, Sunni–Shia relations have been increasingly marked by conflict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/peace-conflict-and-human-rights/sunni-shia-divide/p33176#!/|title=The Sunni-Shia Divide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the [[Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict]]. [[Sectarian violence among Muslims|Sectarian violence]] persists to this day from Pakistan to [[Yemen]] and is a major element of friction throughout the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sasnet.lu.se/ishtiaqtext.html|title=Ishtiaq Ahmed on Pakistan movement|work=lu.se|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318142147/http://www.sasnet.lu.se/ishtiaqtext.html|archivedate=2009-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/7250853/Sunnis-and-Shiites|title=Sunnis and Shiites|work=scribd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions between communities have intensified during power struggles, such as the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|Bahraini uprising]], the [[Iraq War]], and most recently the [[Syrian Civil War]]&lt;ref name="Nasr, Vali 2006, p.106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Civil War"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/featurex/2007/03/civil_war.html|title=Iraq 101: Civil War|work=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arango|first=Tim|title=As Syrians Fight, Sectarian Strife Infects Mideast|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/world/middleeast/sunni-shiite-violence-flares-in-mideast-in-wake-of-syria-war.html?ref=global-home&amp;_r=0|accessdate=2 June 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=1 June 2013|author2=Anne Barnard|author3=Duraid Adnan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the formation of the self-styled [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]] that has launched a [[Genocide of Shias by ISIL|genocide against Shias]].

==Numbers==
Sunnis are a majority in most Muslim communities in champion, China, South Asia, Africa, most of the Arab World, and among [[Muslims in the United States]] (of which 85–90% are Sunnis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewforum.org/Muslim/Mapping-the-Global-Muslim-Population(6).aspx|title=Mapping the Global Muslim Population|date=7 October 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0855613.html|title=World Religions|work=infoplease.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be confusing because the majority of Arab Muslims in the United States are Shia, while the majority of Arab Americans are Christians, the conflation of Arab and Muslim being quite common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/foge.12048/full|title=A Picture is Worth 980 Words: Sign of the Times: Mother of the Savior Lutheran Church, Dearborn, Michigan | doi=10.1111/foge.12048 | volume=58|journal=Focus On Geography|pages=46–48|year=2015 | last1 = Kiskowski | first1 = William L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical beliefs and leadership==

===Successors of Muhammad===
{{further information|Descendants of Muhammad}}

===Mahdi===

The [[Mahdi]] is the prophesied redeemer of Islam. While Shias and Sunnis differ on the nature of the Mahdi, many members of both groups&lt;ref&gt;Glasse, Cyril, ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', Altamira Press, 2001, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; believe that the Mahdi will appear at the end of the world to bring about a perfect and just Islamic society.

In Shia Islam "the Mahdi symbol has developed into a powerful and central religious idea."&lt;ref name="Muslim World 2004 p.421"&gt;Martin, Richard C., ed. (2004), "Mahdi", Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world, Thompson Gale, p.&amp;nbsp;421&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twelvers]] believe the Mahdi will be [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], [[The Twelve Imams|the twelfth Imam]] returned from [[the Occultation]], where he has been hidden by Allah since 874. In contrast, mainstream Sunnis believe the Mahdi will be named Muhammad, be a descendant of Muhammad, and will revive the faith, but will not necessarily be connected with the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, 2006, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hadith===
The Shias accept some of the same ''[[hadith]]s'' used by Sunnis as part of the ''[[sunnah]]'' to argue their case. In addition, they consider the sayings of ''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]'' that are not attributed directly to Muhammad as hadiths. Shias do not accept many Sunni hadiths unless they are also recorded in Shia sources or the methodology can be proven of how they were recorded. Also, some Sunni-accepted hadith are less favored by Shias; one example is that because of Aisha's opposition to Ali, hadiths narrated by Aisha are not given the same authority as those by other companions. Another example is hadith narrated by [[Abu Hurairah#Shi'a view|Abu Hurairah]], who is considered by Shias as the enemy of Ali. The Shia argument is that Abu Hurairah was only a Muslim four years of his life before Muhammad's death. Although he accompanied Muhammad for four years only, he managed to record ten times as many hadiths as Abu Bakr and [[Ali]] each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.al-islam.org/articles/abu-hurayra-and-falsification-traditions-yasin-al-jibouri|title = Abu Hurayra and the Falsification of Traditions (Hadith)|date = |accessdate = 18 May 2015|website = al-islam.org|publisher = Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project|last = al-Jibouri|first = Yasin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shiism and Sufism===
Shiism and Sufism are said to share a number of hallmarks: Belief in an inner meaning to the Quran, special status for some mortals (saints for Sufi, Imams for Shias), as well as veneration of [[Ali]] and Muhammad's family.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, 2006, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pillars of faith===
The [[Five Pillars of Islam]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: أركان الإسلام) is the term given to the five duties incumbent on every Muslim. These duties are ''[[Shahada]]'' (profession of faith), salat (prayers), ''[[Zakāt]]'' (giving of alms), ''[[Sawm]]'' (fasting, specifically during [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]]) and [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]). These five practices are essential to Sunni and Shia Muslims. [[Theology of Twelvers|Shia theology]] has two concepts that define religion as a whole. There are Roots of Religion (''Usūl al-Dīn'') and Branches of Religion (''[[Ancillaries of the Faith|Furu al Din]]'').

===Practices===
Many distinctions can be made between Sunnis and Shiaīs through observation alone:

====Salat====
[[File:Tehran Friday prayer - 16 March 2018 (13961225000386636568071894544919 84859).jpg|thumb|A Sunni Muslim (Left) beside a Shia Muslim (right) showing different ways of holding arms during 16 March 2018 Tehran Friday prayer, [[Iran]].]]
When prostrating during ritual prayer (''[[salat]]''), Shias place their forehead onto a piece of naturally occurring material, most often a clay tablet (''mohr''), soil (''[[turbah]]'') at times from [[Karbala]], the place where Hussein ibn Ali was martyred, instead of directly onto prayer rug.

Some Shia perform prayers back to back, sometimes worshipping two times consecutively (1+2+2 i.e. ''[[fajr]]'' on its own ''[[Dhuhr]]'' with ''[[Asr]]'' and ''[[Maghrib]]'' with ''[[Isha']]''), thus praying five times a day but with a very small break in between the prayer, instead of five prayers with at some gap between them as required by Sunni [[Madh'hab|schools of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamfortoday.com/shia.htm |title=The Origins of the Sunni/Shia split in Islam |accessdate=2007-01-29 |publisher=IslamForToday.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126045119/http://www.islamfortoday.com/shia.htm |archive-date=2007-01-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shias and the followers of the Sunni [[Maliki]] school hold their hands at their sides during prayer; Sunnis of other schools cross their arms (right over left) and clasp their hands;&lt;ref name="Nasr, Vali 2006, p.43"&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, 2006, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; it is commonly held by Sunni scholars especially of [[Maliki]] school that either is acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sharh-e-Muslim|page=28|author1=Nawawi|author2=translated by Maulana Waheed-uz-Zaman Knan|chapter=Volume 2|quote=Imam Ahmed Auzai and Ibn-e-Manzar have said that it is up to the worshipper to perform the prayer in the way he wants. Imam Malik said that a worshipper may fold his hands and place them on his chest and he may pray with unfolded hands, and that is what the Malikis got accustomed with, he further said that hands should be unfolded in obligatory prayers and should be folded in Nafl prayers and Lais bin Sa’ad also said the same thing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tafseer-al-Baari Sharh-e-SAahih Bukhari|author=Maulana Waheed-uz-Zaman Knan|location=Karachi, Pakistan|page=389|chapter=Volume 1|quote=Ibn-e-Qasim has reported the unfolding of hands from Imam Malik, and that is what is practised by the Imamia sect (Shias).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--was ref group="Nail al-Awtar"--&gt;{{cite book|title=Nail-al-Awtar|page=203|chapter=Volume 2|quote=There is no such proven tradition from Holy Prophet*P.B.U.H in regard of folding hands, therefore it is up to the worshipper (whether he offers the prayers with either folded or unfolded hands).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--was ref group="Nail al-Awtar"--&gt;{{cite book|title=Nail al-Awtar|chapter=Volume 3|quote=Ibn-e-Sayd al-Naas narrated from Awzai that it is optional to fold or unfold arms in prayer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fatawa al-Lajna al-Daema|location=Saudi Arabia|author=Ahmed al-Duwaish|chapter=Volume 6|quote=If someone prays with unfolded arms, his prayer is valid, because putting the right hand on the left is neither part of prayer’s pillars nor is a condition of prayer, nor it is wajib (obligatory).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mut'ah and Misyar====
{{See also|Islamic marital practices}}
Twelver Shia as the main branch of Shia Islam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/shia-islam-s-holiest-sites.html|title=Shia Islam's Holiest Sites|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Atlas of the Middle East (Second ed.). Washington, DC: National Geographic|2008|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; permit ''[[Nikah mut‘ah]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al-islam.org/nikah-al-mutah-zina-or-sunnah-toyib-olawuyi/3-allah-calls-mutah-good-thing Allah Calls Mut’ah “A Good Thing”] Retrieved 10 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al-islam.org/completion-argument-maulana-sayyid-saeed-akhtar-rizvi/mutah-temporary-marriage#fref_e0fe9956_1 Mutah (Temporary Marriage)] Retrieved 10 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;—fixed-term temporary marriage—which is not acceptable within the Sunni community, the Ismaili Shia or the Zaidi Shia and is believed a planned and agreed fornication. Twelvers believe that Mutah was permitted until Umar [[Hadith of Umar's speech of forbidding Mut'ah|forbade it]] during his rule. Mutah is not the same as ''[[Nikah Misyar|Misyar]]'' marriage or '' 'Arfi'' marriage, which has no date of expiration and is permitted by some Sunnis. A Misyar marriage differs from a conventional [[Marriage in Islam|Islamic marriage]] in that the man does not have financial responsibility of the woman by her own free will. The man can divorce the woman whenever he wants to in a Misyar marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/misyar.htm |title=Misyar marriage |accessdate=2009-08-25 |publisher=lexicorient.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hijab and dress====
{{See also|Islam and clothing}}
Both Sunni and Shia women wear the ''[[hijab]]''. Devout women of the Shia traditionally wear black and yellow as do some Sunni women in the Persian Gulf. Some Shia religious leaders also wear a black robe. Mainstream Shia and Sunni women wear the ''[[hijab]]'' differently. Some Sunni scholars emphasize covering of all body including the face in public whereas some scholars exclude the face from hijab. Shias believe that the hijab must cover around the perimeter of the face and up to the chin.&lt;ref name=Hijab&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rizvi|first1=Sayyid Muhammad|title=Hijab, The Muslim Womens Dress, Islamic or Cultural?|url=http://www.al-islam.org/hijab-muslim-womens-dress-islamic-or-cultural-sayyid-muhammad-rizvi/sunna-and-hijab|website=Al-Islam|publisher=Ja‘fari Islamic Centre (Tabligh Committee) Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Sunnis, some Shia women, such as those in Iran and Iraq, use their hand to hold the black ''[[chador]]'', in order to cover their faces when in public.

====Given names====
Shia are sometimes recognizable by their names, which are often derived from the names of [[Ahl al-Bayt]]. In particular, the names Fatima, Zaynab, Ali, Abbas, Hussein, and Hassan are disproportionately common among Shias, though they may also be used by Sunnis.&lt;ref name="Nasr, Vali 2006, p.43"/&gt; Umar, Uthman, Abu Bakr, Aisha, Muawiya, being the names of figures recognized by Sunnis but not Shias, are commonly used as names for Sunnis but are very rare, if not virtually absent, for Shias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2006/02/how_can_sunnis_and_shiites_tell_each_other_apart.html|title=How can Sunnis and Shiites tell each other apart?|work=Slate Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Abbasid era===
[[File:Destruction of the Tomb of Husain at Kerbela.jpg|thumb|Destruction of the Tomb of [[Husayn ibn Ali]] at [[Karbala]], condemned in a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] era manuscript.]]

The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] were overthrown in 750 by a new dynasty, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]]. The first Abbasid caliph, [[As-Saffah]], recruited Shia support in his campaign against the Umayyads by emphasising his blood relationship to Muhammad's household through descent from his uncle, [[‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib]].&lt;ref&gt;''The March of Islam: Time Frame, AD 600–800'', p. 48. Pub. Robert H. Smith. [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]]: [[Time Life]], 1988. {{ISBN|0809464217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shia also believe that he promised them that the Caliphate, or at least religious authority, would be vested in the Shia Imam. As-Saffah assumed both the temporal and religious mantle of Caliph himself. He continued the Umayyad dynastic practice of succession, and his brother [[al-Mansur]] succeeded him in 754.

[[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Shia Imam, died during al-Mansur's reign, and there were claims that he was murdered on the orders of the caliph.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ya'qubi]]; vol. III'', pp. 91–96, and ''[[Concise History of Humanity (book)|Tarikh Abul Fida]]'', vol. I, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; (However, Abbasid persecution of Islamic lawyers was not restricted to the Shia. [[Abū Ḥanīfa]], for example, was imprisoned by al-Mansur and tortured.)

Shia sources further claim that by the orders of the tenth Abassid caliph, [[al-Mutawakkil]], the tomb of the third Imam, Hussein ibn Ali in Karbala, was completely demolished,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bihar al-Anwar]]'', vol. XII, on the life of Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq&lt;/ref&gt; and Shias were sometimes beheaded in groups, buried alive, or even placed alive within the walls of government buildings still under construction.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shi'a Islam (book)|Shi'a Islam]]'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shia believe that their community continued to live for the most part in hiding and followed their religious life secretly without external manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ya'qubi]]. vol. II, p. 224; Abu'l-Fida', vol. I, p. 192; [[Al-Masudi]], vol. III, p. 81', also ''[[Shi'a Islam (book)|Shi'a Islam]]'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===
Many Shia Iranians migrated to what is now Iraq in the 16th century. "It is said that when modern Iraq was formed, some of the population of Karbala was Iranian". In time, these immigrants adopted the Arabic language and Arab identity, but their origin has been used to "unfairly cast them as lackeys of Iran".&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, 2006, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;  However many of these Shias come from Sayyid families with origins in tribes from Iraq, Lebanon and Bahrain, one of said tribes being al-Musawi, and two prevalent families that are descended from it and lived in Iran for some time before settling in Iraq are the al-Qazwini and al-Shahristani families. Other Iraqi Shias are ethnic Arabs with roots in Iraq as deep as those of their Sunni counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, 2006, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persia===
{{Main article|Islam in Iran}}
[[Shafi'i]] Sunnism was the dominant form of Islam in most of Iran until rise of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Empire]] although a significant undercurrent of [[Ismailism]] and a very large minority of Twelvers were present all over Persia.

The Sunni hegemony did not undercut the Shia presence in Iran. The writers of [[The Four Books|the Shia Four Books]] were Iranian, as were many other great scholars. According to [[Morteza Motahhari]]:&lt;ref name="Motahhari"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/vol6-n2-1989/islam-and-iran-historical-study-mutual-services-ayatullah-murtadha-mutahhar-0|title=Islam and Iran: A Historical Study of Mutual Services Part 2|work=Al-Islam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The majority of Iranians turned to Shi'ism from the Safawid period onwards. Of course, it cannot be denied that Iran's environment was more favourable to the flourishing of the Shi'ism as compared to all other parts of the Muslim world. Shi'ism did not penetrate any land to the extent that it gradually could in Iran. With the passage of time, Iranians' readiness to practise Shi'ism grew day by day. Had Shi`ism not been deeply rooted in the Iranian spirit, the Safawids (907–1145/1501–1732) would not have succeeded in converting Iranians to the Shi'i creed and making them follow the Prophet's [[Ahl al-Bayt]] sheerly by capturing political power.}}

====Pre-Safavid====
The domination of the Sunni creed during the first nine Islamic centuries characterizes the religious history of Iran during this period. There were some exceptions to this general domination which emerged in the form of the Zaidis of [[Tabaristan]], the [[Buyid dynasty|Buwayhid]], the rule of the [[Sultan]] [[Öljaitü|Muhammad Khudabandah]] (r. 1304–1316) and the [[Sarbadars|Sarbedaran]]. Nevertheless, apart from this domination there existed, firstly, throughout these nine centuries, Shia inclinations among many Sunnis of this land and, secondly, Twelver and Zaidi Shiism had prevalence in some parts of Iran. During this period, the Shia in Iran were nourished from [[Kufa]], [[Baghdad]] and later from [[Najaf]] and [[Al Hillah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mot/iraqishiism/|title=Four Centuries of Influence of Iraqi Shiism on Pre-Safavid Iran|work=Al-Islam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shia were dominant in Tabaristan, [[Qom]], [[Kashan]], [[Avaj]] and [[Sabzevar]]. In many other areas the population of Shias and Sunni was mixed.

The first Zaidi state was established in [[Dailamites|Daylaman]] and Tabaristan (northern Iran) in 864 by the [[Alavids]];&lt;ref&gt;Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali al-Zaidi, ''At-tarikh as-saghir 'an ash-shia al-yamaniyeen'' (Arabic: التاريخ الصغير عن الشيعة اليمنيين, A short History of the Yemenite Shi‘ites), 2005 Referencing: Iranian Influence on Moslem Literature&lt;/ref&gt; it lasted until the death of its leader at the hand of the [[Samanids]] in 928. Roughly forty years later the state was revived in [[Gilan Province|Gilan]] (north-western Iran) and survived under Hasanid leaders until 1126. After which from the 12th-13th centuries, the Zaidis of Daylaman, Gilan and Tabaristan then acknowledge the Zaidi [[Imam]]s of Yemen or rival Zaidi Imams within Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, ''At-tarikh as-saghir 'an ash-shia al-yamaniyeen'' (Arabic: التاريخ الصغير عن الشيعة اليمنيين, A short History of the Yemenite Shi‘ites), 2005 Referencing: Encyclopedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buyids, who were Zaidi and had a significant influence not only in the provinces of Persia but also in the capital of the caliphate in Baghdad, and even upon the caliph himself, provided a unique opportunity for the spread and diffusion of Shia thought. This spread of Shiism to the inner circles of the government enabled the Shia to withstand those who opposed them by relying upon the power of the caliphate.

Twelvers came to Iran from Arab regions in the course of four stages. First, through the [[Asharis tribe]]{{Clarify|date=August 2013}} at the end of the 7th and during the 8th century. Second through the pupils of Sabzevar, and especially those of [[Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid]], who were from [[Rey, Iran|Rey]] and [[Sabzawar]] and resided in those cities. Third, through the school of Hillah under the leadership of [[Al-Hilli]] and his son [[Fakhr al-Muhaqqiqin]]. Fourth, through the scholars of [[Jabal Amel]] residing in that region, or in Iraq, during the 16th and 17th centuries who later migrated to Iran.&lt;ref name="Jafarian2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?print=589|title=A Study of the Migration of Shi'i Works from Arab Regions to Iran at the Early Safavid Era. -- Imam Reza (A.S.)

On the other hand, the Ismaili [[Dawah|da‘wah]] ("missionary institution") sent missionaries (''du‘āt'', sg. ''dā‘ī'') during the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] to Persia. When the Ismailis divided into two sects, [[Nizari]]s established their base in northern Persia. [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] conquered fortresses and captured [[Alamut]] in 1090. Nizaris used this fortress until the [[Mongols]] finally seized and destroyed it in 1256.

After the Mongols and the fall of the Abbasids, the Sunni [[Ulama]] suffered greatly. In addition to the destruction of the caliphate there was no official Sunni school of law. Many libraries and madrasahs were destroyed and Sunni scholars migrated to other Islamic areas such as [[Anatolia]] and Egypt. In contrast, most Shia were largely unaffected as their center was not in Iran at this time. For the first time, the Shia could openly convert other Muslims to their movement.

Several local Shia dynasties like the [[Marashi]] and Sarbadars were established during this time. The kings of the [[Kara Koyunlu]] dynasty ruled in [[Tabriz]] with a domain extending to [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kerman]]. In Egypt the Fatimid government ruled.&lt;ref name="athir"&gt;''al-Ka-mil'' of [[Ibn Athir]], Cairo, 1348; ''Raudat al-safa' ''; and ''Habib as-Siyar'' of Khwand Mir&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad Khudabandah, the famous builder of [[Soltaniyeh]], was among the first of the Mongols to convert to Shiaism, and his descendants ruled for many years in Persia and were instrumental in spreading Shī‘ī thought.&lt;ref&gt;''Abu'l-Fida' '', vol. II, p. 63 and vol. III, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Sufism played a major role in spread of Shiism in this time.
{{quote|After the Mongol invasion Shiims and Sufism once again formed a close association in many ways. Some of the Ismailis whose power had broken by the Mongols, went underground and appeared later within Sufi orders or as new branches of already existing orders. In Twelve-Imam Shiism, from the 13th to the 16th century, Sufism began to grow within official Shiite circles.&lt;ref&gt;Hossein Nasr (1972) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ghulat|extremist sects]] of the [[Hurufism|Hurufis]] and [[Shasha'a]] grew directly out of a background that is both [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] and Sufi. More important in the long run than these sects were the Sufi orders which spread in Persia at this time and aided in the preparing the ground for the Shiite movement of Safavids. Two of these orders are of particular significance in this question of the relation of Shiism and Sufism: The [[Ni'matullāhī|Nimatullahi]] order and [[Nurbakhshi]] order.|[[Hossein Nasr]]&lt;ref&gt;Nasr (1972) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Post-Safavid====
[[Ismail I]] initiated a religious policy to recognize Shiism as the official religion of the Safavid Empire, and the fact that modern Iran and Azerbaijan remain majority-Shia states is a direct result of Ismail's actions.

Unfortunately for Ismail, most of his subjects were Sunni. He thus had to [[Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism|enforce official Shiism]] violently, putting to death those who opposed him. Under this pressure, Safavid subjects either converted or pretended to convert, but it is safe to say that the majority of the population was probably genuinely Shia by the end of the Safavid period in the 18th century, and most Iranians today are Shia, although there is still a Sunni minority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/empires/safavid/ Shah Ismail I, 1501-26] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427202257/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/empires/safavid/ |date=April 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Immediately following the establishment of Safavid power the migration of scholars began and they were invited to Iran ... By the side of the immigration of scholars, Shi'i works and writings were also brought to Iran from Arabic-speaking lands, and they performed an important role in the religious development of Iran ... In fact, since the time of the leadership of Shaykh Mufid and Shaykh Tusi, Iraq had a central academic position for Shi'ism. This central position was transferred to Iran during the Safavid era for two-and-a-half centuries, after which it partly returned to Najaf. ... Before the Safavid era Shi'i manuscripts were mainly written in Iraq, with the establishment of the Safavid rule these manuscripts were transferred to Iran.&lt;ref name="Jafarian2"/&gt;}}This led to a wide gap between Iran and its Sunni neighbors, particularly its rival, the [[Ottoman Empire]], in the wake of the [[Battle of Chaldiran]]. This gap continued until the 20th century.

Shias claim that despite these advances, many Shias in Syria continued to be killed during this period for their faith. One of these was [[Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili|Muhammad Ibn Makki]], called ''Shahid-i Awwal (the First Martyr)'', one of the great figures in Shia jurisprudence, who was killed in [[Damascus]] in 1384.&lt;ref name="athir"/&gt;

===South Asia===
{{Main article|Islam in Asia}}
Sunni–Shia clashes also occurred occasionally in the 20th century in South Asia. There were many between 1904 and 1908. These clashes revolved around the public cursing of the first three caliphs by Shias and the praising of them by Sunnis. To put a stop to the violence, public demonstrations were banned in 1909 on the three most sensitive days: [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], [[Arba'een|Chehlum]] and Ali's death on 21 Ramadan. Intercommunal violence resurfaced in 1935–36 and again in 1939 when many thousands of Sunni and Shias defied the ban on public demonstrations and took to the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Momen, Moojan, ''An Introduction to Shi'i Islam'', Yale University Press, 1985, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; Shia are estimated to be 21–35% of the Muslim population in South Asia, although the total number is difficult to estimate due to the intermingling between the two groups and practice of ''[[taqiyya]]'' by Shia.&lt;ref&gt;Momen, Moojan, ''An Introduction to Shi'i Islam'', Yale University Press, 1985, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunni razzias which came to be known as ''Taarajs'' virtually devastated the community. History records 10 such Taarajs also known as ''Taraj-e-Shia'' between the 15th and 19th centuries in 1548, 1585, 1635, 1686, 1719, 1741, 1762, 1801, 1830, 1872 during which the Shia habitations were plundered, people slaughtered, libraries burnt and their sacred sites desecrated.&lt;ref name="Kashmir Observer"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.kashmirobserver.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4682:shias-of-kashmir-socio-political-dilemmas&amp;catid=14:features&amp;Itemid=12|title= Shias of Kashmir – Socio Political Dilemmas| publisher=Kashmir Observer |accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mughal Empire====
Shia in South Asia faced persecution by some Sunni rulers and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperors]] which resulted in the killings of Shia scholars like [[Qazi Nurullah Shustari]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zot5IK1csp0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=AN+INTRODUCTION+TO+SHI'I+ISLAM++The+History+and+Doctrines+of+Twelver+Shi'ism++MOOJAN+MOMEN&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O474eRH6BV&amp;sig=hfsq_LSAcu889KiOn70VR-GIWz0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vlg9TLvJA8O78gbc4ayNBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=AN%20INTRODUCTION%20TO%20SHI'I%20ISLAM%20The%20History%20and%20Doctrines%20of%20Twelver%20Shi'ism%20MOOJAN%20MOMEN&amp;f=false An introduction to Shi'i Islam: the history and doctrines of Twelver Shi'ism] By Moojan Momen, #121.&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as ''Shaheed-e-Thaalis'', the third Martyr) and [[Mirza Muhammad Kamil Dehlavi]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://sibtain.org/books/af/default.htm Muhammad Hussain Najafi, ''Ahsan ul-Fawaid'' pp. 38]&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as'' Shaheed-e- Rabay'', the fourth Martyr) who are two of the [[Five Martyrs of Shia Islam|five martyrs of Shia Islam]].

In addition to Iran, Iraq has emerged as a major Shia government when the Twelvers achieved political dominance in 2005 under American occupation. The two communities have often remained separate, mingling regularly only during the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca. In some countries like Iraq, Syria, Kuwait and Bahrain, communities have mingled and intermarried. Some Shia have complained of mistreatment in countries dominated by Sunnis, especially in Saudi Arabia,&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage'', Simon and Schuster, (2001), pp. 149–58&lt;/ref&gt; while some Sunnis have complained of discrimination in the Twelver-dominated states of Iraq and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/49b91f6d2.pdf Information on sectarian violence against Sunni Muslims] UNHCR&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some reports, as of mid-2013, the [[Syrian Civil War]] has become "overtly sectarian" with the "sectarian lines fall most sharply" between Alawites and Sunnis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/20/world/meast/syria-civil-war Syrian fight now 'overtly sectarian,' U.N. says]| By Joe Sterling, Saad Abedine and Salma Abdelaziz, CNN| December 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; With the involvement of Lebanese Shia paramilitary group [[Hezbollah]], the fighting in Syria has reignited "long-simmering tensions between Sunnis and Shi’ites" spilling over into Lebanon and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/world/2013/06/01/syrians-fight-sectarian-strife-infects-mideast/0Kqz8A4zGDXir53FAI6MlJ/story.html As Syria fights, sectarian wave rises in region]|
By Tim Arango and Anne Barnard| New York Times| 2 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-Ambassador [[Dimitar Mihaylov]] further claims that the current post-Arab Spring situation (encompassing ISIS, the Syrian civil war, Yemen, Iraq and others) represents a "qualitatively new" development in the history of Shi'a-Sunni dynamics. Historically, the inner rifts within Islamic ideology were to be hidden from the public sphere, while the new violent outbreaks highlight said rift in an obvious manner and is nourished by the two extremes of their mutual rivalry which will strongly affect both globally and regionally.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/23739770.2015.1003455 | volume=9 | title=Cracks in the Crescent: The Looming Sectarian Clash between Khilafah and Imamah | year=2015 | journal=Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs | pages=49–61 | last1 = Mihaylov | first1 = Dimitar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1919–1970===
At least one scholar sees the period from the collapse of the Ottoman Empire through the decline of [[Arab nationalism]] as a time of relative unity and harmony between traditionalist Sunni and Shia Muslims—unity brought on by a feeling of being under siege from a common threat, [[secularism]], first of the European colonial variety and then Arab nationalist.&lt;ref name="Nasr, Vali 2006, p.106"&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, 2006, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of Sunni–Shia cooperation was the [[Khilafat Movement]] which swept South Asia following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, the seat of the Caliphate, in [[World War I]]. Shia scholars "came to the caliphate's defence" by attending the 1931 Caliphate Conference in [[Jerusalem]], although they were theologically opposed to the idea that non-imams could be caliphs or successors to Muhammad, and that the caliphate was "the flagship institution" of Sunni, not Shia, authority. This has been described as unity of traditionalists in the face of the twin threats of "secularism and colonialism."&lt;ref name="Nasr, Vali 2006, p.106"/&gt;

In these years [[Allama Muhammad Taqi Qummi]] travelled to [[Cairo]] and started his efforts for reforming Islamic unity at [[Al-Azhar University]], since 1938. Finally, his efforts and contacting with scholars such as [[Mahmud Shaltut]] and [[Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi]] led to the founding of [[Dar-al-Taghrib]] (community for reforming unity between Sunni and Shia Muslims).&lt;ref name="Qummi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=6992 | title=Allama Muhammad Taqi Qummi | publisher=Imam Reza. net | accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of unity was a [[fatwā]] issued by the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of [[Al-Azhar University]], [[Mahmud Shaltut]], recognizing [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Shia Islamic law]] as the fifth school of Islamic law. In 1959, al-Azhar University in Cairo, the most influential center of Sunni learning, authorized the teaching of courses of Shia jurisprudence as part of its curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, 2006, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

The year of the [[Iranian Islamic Revolution]] was "one of great ecumentical discourse",&lt;ref name=roy-123&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=Olivier|title=The Failure of Political Islam|date=1994|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEGw8S3ovaoC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=one+of+great+ecuminical+discourse+roy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EAl-vQW7WM&amp;sig=3DKxhWLi43WllUayiB_TJCfUji4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=df9EVe2aBsXroATizYHwCA&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=one%20of%20great%20ecuminical%20discourse%20roy&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shared enthusiasm by both Shia and Sunni Islamists.
After the [[Iranian Revolution]], [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] endeavored to bridge the gap between Shiites and Sunnis by declaring it permissible for Twelvers to pray behind Sunni imams and by forbidding criticizing the Caliphs who preceded Ali—an issue that had caused much animosity between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1175008835987&amp;pagename=Zone-English-Muslim_Affairs%2FMAELayout#9 Frequently Asked Questions on Iran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107074118/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1175008835987&amp;pagename=Zone-English-Muslim_Affairs%2FMAELayout |date=2009-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he designated the period of Prophet's Birthday celebrations from 12th to the 17th of Rabi Al-Awwal as the ''Islamic Unity Week'', there being a gap in the dates of when Shiites and Sunnis celebrate Muhammad's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adib-Moghaddam|first1=Arshin|title=The International Politics of the Persian Gulf: A Cultural Genealogy|isbn=0-415-38559-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g7CATDpNy-UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this period, Sunni–Shia strife has seen a major upturn, particularly in Iraq and Pakistan, leading to thousands of deaths. Among the explanations for the increase are conspiracies by outside forces to divide Muslims,&lt;ref name=guardian-2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name="mideastwire.com" /&gt; the recent Islamic revival and increased religious purity and consequent [[takfir]],&lt;ref name=nasr-2006-106 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nasr-2006-148 /&gt; upheaval, destruction and loss of power of Sunni caused by the US invasion of Iraq, and [[sectarianism]] generated by Arab regimes defending themselves against the mass uprisings of the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name="NYRB-Ruthven"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruthven|first1=Malise|title=How to Understand ISIS|journal=New York Review of Books|date=23 June 2016|volume=63|issue=11|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/how-to-understand-isis/|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Western analysts assert that the US is practicing [[divide and rule]] strategy through the escalation of Sunni-Shia conflict.

;Islamic revival
Others lay the blame for the strife at a very different source, the unintended effects of the [[Islamic revival]]. According to scholar [[Vali Nasr]], as the Muslim world was decolonialised and [[Arab nationalism]] lost its appeal, fundamentalism blossomed and reasserted the differences and conflicts between the two movements, particularly in the strict teachings of Sunni scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]].&lt;ref name=nasr-2006-106&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, 2006, pp. 106–07&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian Islamic revolution changed the Shia–Sunni power equation in Muslim countries "from Lebanon to India" arousing the traditionally subservient Shia to the alarm of traditionally dominant and very non-revolutionary Sunni.&lt;ref name=nasr-2006-148&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pp. 148–50&lt;/ref&gt; "Where Iranian revolutionaries saw Islamic revolutionary stirrings, Sunnis saw mostly Shia mischief and a threat to Sunni predominance."&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pp. 143–44&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Iranian revolution's leader, [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], was very much in favor of Shia–Sunni unity, he also challenged Saudi Arabia, in his view an "unpopular and corrupt dictatorship" and an "American lackey" ripe for revolution. In part because Saudi Arabia was the world's major international [[Islamism#Saudi Arabian funding|funder]] of Islamic schools, scholarships, and fellowships, this angered not only Saudi Arabia but its many fundamentalist allies and benefactors throughout the Arab world, according to Nasr.&lt;ref name="Nasr, Vali 2006 p.143-4"&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' Norton, (2006), pp. 143–44, 147–48, 150–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect noted by political scientist [[Gilles Kepel]], is that the initial attraction of the [[Islamic Revolution]] to Sunnis as well as Shia, and Khomeini's desire to export his revolution motivated the Saudi establishment to shore up its "religious legitimacy" with more strictness in religion (and with jihad in Afghanistan) to compete with Iran's revolutionary ideology.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:137&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; But doing so in Saudi meant a more anti-Shia policies because Saudi's own native Sunni school of Islam is [[Wahhabism]], which includes the prohibition of Shia Islam itself, as strict Wahhabis do not consider Shia to be Islamic. This new strictness was spread not only among Saudis in the kingdom but thousands of students and Saudi funded schools and international Islamist volunteers who came to training camps in Peshawar Pakistan in the 1980s to learn to fight jihad in Afghanistan and went home in the 1990s to fight jihad. Both groups (especially in Iraq and Pakistan) saw Shia as the enemy.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:142-3&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: pp. 142–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gonzalez-2009-78&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Nathan|title=The Sunni-Shia Conflict: Understanding Sectarian Violence in the Middle East|date=2009|publisher=Nortia Media Ltd.|pages=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HypnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=shia+wahhabi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMImKGnouPTxgIVFRqSCh0olw7x#v=onepage&amp;q=shia%20wahhabi&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Murphy-2013-97&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=Eamon|title=The Making of Terrorism in Pakistan: Historical and Social Roots of Extremism|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19mPVOBZ_9YC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=shia+wahhabi+pakistan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI--qpoeXTxgIVzwWSCh14OABA#v=onepage&amp;q=shia%20wahhabi%20pakistan&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although the Iranian revolution's leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, was very much in favor of Shia–Sunni unity, and "the leadership position that went with it",&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' Norton, (2006), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; his revolution worked against it.

From the Iranian Revolution to 2015, Shia groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, supported by Iran have recently won "important political victories" which have boosted Iran's regional influence.&lt;ref name=CFR-SSD&gt;{{cite web|title=The Shia-Sunni Divide|url=http://www.cfr.org/peace-conflict-and-human-rights/sunni-shia-divide/p33176#!/|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Lebanon, [[Hezbollah]], the Lebanese Shia militia and political movement is the "strongest political actor" in the country. Since the 2003 [[invasion of Iraq]] removed [[Saddam Hussein]] from power and instituted elected government, the Shia majority has dominated the parliament and its prime ministers have been Shia.&lt;ref name=CFR-SSD /&gt; In Syria, a Shia minority—the heterodox Alawi sect that makes up only about 13 percent of the population—dominate the upper reaches of the government, military and security services in Syria, and are the "backbone" of the forces fighting to protect the [[Bashir al-Assad]] regime in Syria's civil war.&lt;ref name=CFR-SSD /&gt; In Yemen, [[Houthis|Houthi]] rebels have expanded their territory south of Saudi Arabia, and become the country's "[[Houthi insurgency in Yemen|dominant power]]".&lt;ref name=CFR-SSD /&gt;

[[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]], research director at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]], sees the "Shia awakening and its instrumentalisation by Iran" as leading to a "very violent Sunni reaction", starting first in Pakistan before spreading to "the rest of the Muslim world, without necessarily being as violent." According to Roy, "two events created a sea change in the balance of power between Shia and Sunnis: the Islamic revolution in Iran and the American military intervention in Iraq" in 2003. "Today, Azerbaijan is probably the only country where there are still mixed mosques and Shia and Sunnis pray together."&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Olivier, ''The Politics of Chaos in the Middle East'', Columbia University Press, 2008.  p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1994 to 2014 satellite television and high-speed Internet has spread "hate speech" against both Sunni and Shia. Fundamentalist Sunni clerics have popularized slurs against Shia such as "Safawis" (from the [[Safavid]] empire, thus implying their being an Iranian agents), or even worse ''rafidha'' (rejecters of the faith), and ''majus'' ([[Zoroastrian]] or crypto Persian). In turn, Shia religious scholars have "mocked and cursed" the first three caliphs and [[Aisha]], Mohammed's youngest wife who fought against [[Ali]].&lt;ref name=CFR-SSD /&gt;

;US invasion of Iraq

Among those blaming the US invasion of Iraq are Fawaz Gerges, who writes in his book ''ISIS: A History'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;By destroying state institutions and establishing a sectarian-based political system, the 2003 US-led invasion polarized the country along Sunni-Shia lines and set the stage for a fierce, prolonged struggle driven by identity politics. Anger against the United States was also fueled by the humiliating disbandment of the Iraqi army and the de-Baathification law, which was first introduced as a provision and then turned into a permanent article of the constitution.&lt;ref name="NYRB-Ruthven" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Malise Ruthven writes that the post invasion [[de-Ba'athification]] by the US occupiers deprived Iraq of "the officer class and administrative cadres that had ruled under Saddam Hussein, leaving the field to sectarian-based militias".&lt;ref name="NYRB-Ruthven" /&gt; Many of officers joined the anti-Shia takfiri [[ISIL]] group.

The US-led invasion also “tilted the regional balance of power decisively" in favor of Shia Iran, alarming Sunni and leading to talk of a “Shia Crescent”.&lt;ref name="NYRB-Ruthven" /&gt;

;Counter-revolutionary tactic

[[Marc Lynch]] in his book ''The New Arab Wars: Uprisings and Anarchy in the Middle East'', argues that as old regimes or political forces sought to control "the revolutionary upsurge" of the [[Arab Spring]], [[sectarianism]] became “a key weapon” to undermine unity among the anti-regime masses. Christians were pitted "against Muslims in Egypt, Jordanians against Palestinians in Jordan, and, above all, Sunnis against Shi’ites wherever possible.”&lt;ref name="NYRB-Ruthven" /&gt;

Shia–Sunni discord in Iraq starts with disagreement over the relative population of the two groups. According to most sources, including the CIA's ''[[The World Factbook|World Factbook]]'', the majority of Iraqis are Shia [[Arab Muslims]] (60%-70%), and Sunni [[Arab Muslims]] represent between 32% and 37% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html#People|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sunni are split ethnically among [[Arab people|Arabs]], [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] and [[Iraqi Turkmens|Turkmen]]. Many Sunnis hotly dispute their minority status, including ex-Iraqi Ambassador Faruq Ziada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/ziada12272006.html|title=Is There a Sunni Majority in Iraq?|work=counterpunch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many believe Shia majority is "a myth spread by America".&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' Norton, (2006), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; One Sunni belief shared by Jordan's [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah]] as well as his then Defense Minister Shaalan is that Shia numbers in Iraq were inflated by Iranian Shias crossing the border.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Wright and Peter Baker, "Iraq: Jordan Sees Threat to the Election from Iran", ''Washington Post'', Dec. 8, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Shia scholar Vali Nasr believes the election turnout in summer and December 2005 confirmed a strong Shia majority in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' Norton, (2006), p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

The British, having put down a Shia rebellion against their rule in the 1920s, "confirmed their reliance on a corps of Sunni ex-officers of the collapsed Ottoman empire". The British [[Colonialism|colonial]] rule ended after the Sunni and Shia united against it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Arab Shia'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shia suffered indirect and direct [[Persecution of Shia Muslims|persecution]] under post-colonial Iraqi governments since 1932, erupting into [[Iraqi Shia revolts 1935–1936|full-scale rebellions]] in 1935 and 1936. Shias were also persecuted during the [[Ba'ath Party]] rule, especially under [[Saddam Hussein]]. It is said that every Shia clerical family of note in Iraq had tales of torture and murder to recount.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', (Norton, 2006), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 the son of Iraq's highest Shia Ayatollah [[Muhsin al-Hakim]] was arrested and allegedly tortured. From 1979–1983 Saddam's regime executed 48 major Shia clerics in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;according to pro-Khomeini author Abdel-Majid Trab Zemzem, in his book ''The Iraq-Iran War, Islam and Nationalisms'', translated from the French by Zinab Mohammad, United States Publishing Company, 1986, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; They included Shia leader [[Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr]] and his sister. Tens of thousands of Iranians and Arabs of Iranian origin were expelled in 1979 and 1980 and a further 75,000 in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shias openly [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|revolted against Saddam]] following the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 and were encouraged by Saddam's defeat in Kuwait and by simultaneous Kurdish uprising in the north. However, Shia opposition to the government was brutally suppressed, resulting in some 50,000 to 100,000 casualties and successive repression by Saddam's forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Black|first1=Ian|title='Chemical Ali' on trial for brutal crushing of Shia uprising|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/22/iraq.ianblack|accessdate=17 May 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governing regimes of Iraq were composed mainly of Sunnis for nearly a century until the 2003 Iraq War.

* Iraq War
Some of the worst [[Sectarian violence|sectarian strife]] ever has occurred after the start of the Iraq War, steadily building up to the present.&lt;ref name="Civil War" /&gt; The war has featured a cycle of Sunni–Shia revenge killing—Sunni often used car bombs, while Shia favored [[death squad]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w051128&amp;s=ackerman120105 The Rise of Shia Death Squads] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711132352/http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w051128&amp;s=ackerman120105 |date=July 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one estimate, as of early 2008, 1,121 suicide bombers have blown themselves up in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/03/14/7682/ March 14, 2008 The Independent/UK "The Cult of the Suicide Bomber" by Robert Fisk] "month-long investigation by The Independent, culling four Arabic-language newspapers, official Iraqi statistics, two Beirut news agencies and Western reports"&lt;/ref&gt; Sunni [[suicide attack|suicide bombers]] have targeted not only thousands of civilians,&lt;ref&gt;over half of the 20,000 fatalities worldwide from terrorism in 2006 occurred in Iraq according to the American National Counter-terrorism Center [http://wits.nctc.gov/reports/crot2006nctcannexfinal.pdf Report on Terrorist Incidents 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326171214/http://wits.nctc.gov/reports/crot2006nctcannexfinal.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }} p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; but [[2006 al-Askari Mosque bombing|mosques]], shrines,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/BA05CFF2-8D0A-4B2D-BBD0-B92EB85E1267.htm Al Jazeera English – News – Car Bomb Blast Near Iraq Shrine]&lt;/ref&gt; wedding and funeral processions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/05/24/bomb-iraq.html|title=Iraqi funeral procession bombed; at least 26 killed|date=24 May 2007|work=cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; markets, hospitals, offices, and streets.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', (Norton, 2006), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Sunni insurgent organizations include [[Ansar al-Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/68049.pdf|title=Ansar al-Islam is listed as a terrorist group by the US State Dept|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical groups include [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq|Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad]], [[Jaish al-Ta'ifa al-Mansurah]], [[Jeish Muhammad]], and [[Black Banner Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2005/64344.htm|title=We're sorry, that page can't be found.|website=www.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Takfir]]'' motivation for many of these killings may come from Sunni insurgent leader [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]].

==== Iran ====
{{Main|Islam in Iran|Freedom of religion in Iran}}
Iran is unique in the Muslim world because its population is overwhelmingly more Shia than Sunni (Shia constitute 95% of the population) and because its constitution is [[Theocracy|theocratic]] republic based on rule by a Shia jurist.

Although the founder of the [[Islamic republic|Islamic Republic]], Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, supported good Sunni–Shia relations, there have been complaints by Sunni of discrimination, particularly in important government positions.&lt;ref name="iran.org"&gt;[http://www.iran.org/news/TIB_970602.htm Interview with Molavi Ali Akbar Mollahzadeh] The Iran Brief,&lt;/ref&gt; In a joint appearance with former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani calling for Shia-Sunni unity, Sunni Shiekh Yusuf al-Qaradawi complained that no ministers in Iran have been Sunni for a long time, that Sunni officials are scarce even in the regions with majority of Sunni population (such as [[Iranian Kurdistan|Kurdistan]], or [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Balochistan]])&lt;ref&gt;Al-Jazeera discussion between Qardawi and Rafsanjani [http://mideastwire.com/topstory.php?id=13704 Rafsanjani &amp; Al-Qaradawi call upon nation to unite &amp; reject fighting, 2007-02-15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929001023/http://mideastwire.com/topstory.php?id=13704 |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and despite the presence of [[Christian]] churches, as a prominent example of this discrimination. Although reformist President [[Mohammad Khatami]] promised during his election campaign to build a Sunni mosque in Tehran, none was built during his eight years in office. The president explained the situation by saying Supreme Leader Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]] would not agree to the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/DL17Ak03.html|title=Asia Times|work=atimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other parts of the Muslim world, other issues may play a part in the conflict, since most Sunnis in Iran are also ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35497.htm|title=Iran|work=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the 1979 revolution, Sunni leaders from Kurdistan, Balouchistan, and [[Khorasan Province|Khorassan]], set up a new party known as ''Shams'', which is short for Shora-ye Markaz-e al Sunaat, to unite Sunnis and lobby for their rights. But six months after that they were closed down, bank accounts suspended and had their leaders arrested by the government on charges that they were backed by Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="iran.org" /&gt;

A [[United Nations|UN]] [[human rights]] report states that:
{{Quote|...information indicates Sunnis, along with other religious minorities, are denied by law or practice access to such government positions as cabinet minister, ambassador, provincial governor, mayor and the like, Sunni schools and mosques have been destroyed, and Sunni leaders have been imprisoned, executed and assassinated. The report notes that while some of the information received may be difficult to corroborate there is a clear impression that the right of freedom of religion is not being respected with regard to the Sunni minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.ca/fortherecord1997/vol3/iran.htm|title=Human Rights Internet|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/commission/country52/95-add2.htm|title=UN Commission on Human Rights – Visit by the Special Rapporteur to Iran (Feb 96)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Members of the 'Balochistan Peoples Front' claim that Sunnis are systematically discriminated against educationally by denial of places at universities, politically by not allowing Sunnis to be army generals, ambassadors, ministers, prime minister, or president, religiously insulting Sunnis in the media, economic discrimination by not giving import or export licenses for Sunni businesses while the majority of Sunnis are left unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://balochistanpeoplesfront.blogspot.com/2006/12/shia-equality-or-shia-supremacy.html Shia equality or Shia supremacy? Balochistan People's Front] Reza Hossein Borr, leadership consultant and author of "New Vision for the Islamic World"&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a low level resistance in mainly Sunni Iranian Balouchistan against the regime for several years. Official media refers to the fighting as armed clashes between the police and "bandits," "drug-smugglers," and "thugs," to disguise what many believe is essentially a political-religious conflict. [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] have stationed several brigades in Balouchi cities, and have allegedly tracked down and assassinated Sunni leaders both inside Iran and in neighboring Pakistan. In 1996 a leading Sunni, Abdulmalek Mollahzadeh, was gunned down by hitmen, allegedly hired by Tehran, as he was leaving his house in Karachi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran.org/news/TIB_970602.htm Interview with Molavi Ali Akbar Mollahzadeh] The Iran Brief, Issue Number 35, June 2, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

''(See [[2007 Zahedan bombings]] for more information)''

Non-Sunni Iranian opposition parties, and Shia like Ayatollah Jalal Gange’i have criticised the regime's treatment of Sunnis and confirmed many Sunni complaints.&lt;ref&gt;NCRI Statement, "[http://briefoniran.com/content/view/114/26/ Ahmadinejad sheds crocodile tears for Sunnis in Iran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927105836/http://briefoniran.com/content/view/114/26/ |date=2007-09-27 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2005 elections, much of the leadership of Iran has been described as more "staunchly committed to core Shia values" and lacking Ayatollah Khomeini's commitment to Shia–Sunni unity.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' Norton, (2006), p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Polemics critical of Sunnis were reportedly being produced in Arabic for dissemination in the Arab Muslim world by [[Hojjatieh]]-aligned elements in the Iranian regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/GI09Ak01.html "Shia Supremacists Emerge from Iran's Shadows" ''Asia Times'', August 27, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian government denies any allegations of discrimination against its Sunni citizens citing facts that there are Sunni mayors, police officers, judges, lawyers, clerics. Sunnis in Iran run multiple religious schools and own mosques that can accommodate thousands of worshipers at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3B6MGqWkpMk|title=Sunnis in Iran (How Sunni Muslims live in a Shiite country?)|date=20 December 2014|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 10,000–15,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilayat.net/attachments/article/3193/No_Sunni_Mosques_Iran%20(1).pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Sunni mosques all over Iran, with 9 in Tehran alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.abna24.com/service/iran/archive/2015/08/06/704292/story.html|title=Sunnis have 15,000 mosques across Iran; 9 mosques in Tehran|date=6 August 2015|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Iranian law, Shias are not allowed to build mosques in Sunni majority areas and vice versa.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==== Syria ====
{{Main|Islam in Syria}}
Syria is approximately three quarters Sunni,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sy.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its government is predominantly [[Alawite]], a Shia sect that makes up less than 15% of the population. Under [[Hafez al-Assad]], Alawites dominated the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]], a secular Arab nationalist party which had ruled Syria under a state of emergency from 1963 to 2011. Alawites are often considered a form of Shia Islam, that differs somewhat from the larger Twelver Shia sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/alawi|title=Define Alawite at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century, an [[Islamic uprising in Syria]] occurred with sectarian religious overtones between the Alawite-dominated Assad government and the [[Islamism|Islamist]] Sunni [[Muslim Brotherhood]], culminating with the 1982 [[Hama massacre]]. An estimated 10,000 to 40,000 Syrians, mostly civilians, were killed by [[Syrian Armed Forces|Syrian military]] in the city. During the uprising, the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood [[Aleppo Artillery School massacre|attacked military cadets]] at an artillery school in [[Aleppo]], performed car bomb attacks in Damascus, as well as bomb attacks against the government and its officials, including Hafez al-Assad himself, and had killed several hundred.

How much of the conflict was sparked by Sunni versus Shia divisions and how much by Islamism versus secular-Arab-nationalism, is in question, but according to scholar Vali Nasr the failure of the Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic of Iran to support the Muslim Brotherhood against the Baathists "earned [Khomeini] the Brotherhood's lasting contempt." It proved to the satisfaction of the Brotherhood that sectarian loyalty trumped Islamist solidarity for Khomeini and eliminated whatever appeal Khomeini might have had to the MB movement as a pan-Islamic leader.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

* Syria Civil War
{{Main|Syrian Civil War}}
The [[Syrian Civil War]], though it started as a political conflict, developed into a struggle between the Alawite-dominated Army and government on the one hand, and the mainly Sunni rebels and former members of the regular army on the other. The casualty toll of the war's first three years has exceeded that of Iraq's decade-long conflict, and the fight has "amplified sectarian tensions to unprecedented levels".&lt;ref name=CFR-SSD /&gt; Rebel groups with 10,000s of Sunni Syrian fighters such as [[Ahrar ash-Sham]], the Islamic Front, and al-Qaeda's [[al-Nusra Front]], employ anti-Shia rhetoric and foreign Arab and Western Sunni fighters have joined the rebels. On the other side Shia from Hezbollah in Lebanon and from Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Kata'ib Hezbollah militias from Iraq have backed the Syrian government.&lt;ref name=CFR-SSD /&gt; "Even Afghan Shia refugees in Iran", driven from Afghanistan by Sunni extremism, have "reportedly been recruited by Tehran for the war in Syria".&lt;ref name=CFR-SSD /&gt;

==== Saudi Arabia ====
{{Main|Islam in Saudi Arabia|Shia Islam in Saudi Arabia|Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia}}
While Shia make up roughly 15% of Saudi Arabia's population,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7959531.stm Saudi Arabia's Shia press for rights] retrieved 19 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; they form a large portion of the residents of the eastern province of [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Hasa]]—by some estimates a majority&lt;ref&gt;"The country's minority Shia populations form a majority in the country's oil rich eastern province of Hasa" [http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/iraqelection2010/2010/03/201037123914357815.html Neighbours eye Iraq elections] By Sam Sasan Shoamanesh&lt;/ref&gt;—where much of the petroleum industry is based. Between 500,000 and a million Shia live there,&lt;ref name="Nasr, Vali 2006 p.236"&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; concentrated especially around the oases of [[Qatif]] and [[Al-Hasa]]. The Majority of Saudi Shia belong to the sect of the Twelvers.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"&gt;Library of Congress: [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+sa0045) Saudi Arabia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saudi conflict of Shia and Sunni extends beyond the borders of the kingdom because of international Saudi "[[Petro-Islam]]" influence. Saudi Arabia backed Iraq in the 1980–1988 war with Iran and sponsored militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan who—though primarily targeting the Soviet Union, which had invaded Afghanistan in 1979—also fought to suppress Shia movements.&lt;ref name=sunni-shia-cfr&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sunni-Shia Divide|url=http://www.cfr.org/peace-conflict-and-human-rights/sunni-shia-divide/p33176#!/|website=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between the Shia and the Wahhabis are inherently strained because the Wahhabis consider the rituals of the Shia to be the epitome of ''shirk'', or [[polytheism]]. In the late 1920s, the [[Ikhwan]] ([[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Ibn Saud's]] fighting force of converted Wahhabi [[Bedouin]] Muslims) were particularly hostile to the Shia and demanded that Abd al Aziz forcibly convert them. In response, Abd al Aziz sent Wahhabi missionaries to the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]], but he did not carry through with attempts at forced conversion. In recent decades the late leading Saudi cleric, [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baaz]], issued fatwa denouncing Shia as apostates, and according to Shia scholar Vali Nasr "Abdul-Rahman al-Jibrin, a member of the Higher Council of Ulama, even sanctioned the killing of Shias,&lt;ref name="Nasr, Vali 2006 p.236" /&gt; a call that was reiterated by Wahhabi religious literature as late as 2002."&lt;ref&gt;Toby Jones, `The Iraq Effect in Saudi Arabia,` ''Middle East Report'', 237, Winter 2005, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Government policy has been to allow Shia their own mosques and to exempt Shia from [[Hanbali]] inheritance practices.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Nevertheless, Shia have been forbidden all but the most modest displays on their principal festivals, which are often occasions of sectarian strife in the Persian Gulf region, with its mixed Sunni–Shia populations.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt;

According to a report by the [[Human Rights Watch]]:
{{Quote|Shia Muslims, who constitute about eight percent of the Saudi population, faced discrimination in employment as well as limitations on religious practices. Shia jurisprudence books were banned, the traditional annual Shia mourning procession of Ashura was discouraged, and operating independent Islamic religious establishments remained illegal. At least seven Shi'a religious leaders-Abd al-Latif Muhammad Ali, Habib al-Hamid, Abd al-Latif al-Samin, Abdallah Ramadan, Sa'id al-Bahaar, Muhammad Abd al-Khidair, and Habib Hamdah Sayid Hashim al-Sadah-reportedly remained in prison for violating these restrictions."&lt;ref&gt;HRW Link: [https://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/mideast/saudi.html Human Rights Developments Saudi Arabia]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And [[Amnesty International]] adds:
{{Quote|Members of the Shi‘a Muslim community (estimated at between 7 and 10 per cent of Saudi Arabia’s population of about 19 million) suffer systematic political, social, cultural as well as religious discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/ailib/intcam/saudi/report.html Amnesty report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225122727/http://www.amnesty.org/ailib/intcam/saudi/report.html |date=February 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As of 2006 four of the 150 members of Saudi Arabia's "handpicked" parliament were Shia, but no city had a Shia mayor or police chief, and none of the 300 girls schools for Shia in the Eastern Province had a Shia principal. According to scholar Vali Nasr, Saudi textbooks "characterize Shiism as a form of heresy ... worse than [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]]."&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced into exile in the 1970s, Saudi Shia leader [[Hassan al-Saffar]] is said to have been "powerfully influenced" by the works of Sunni Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] and by their call for Islamic revolution and an Islamic state.&lt;ref&gt;"The Shiite Question in Saudi Arabia", ''Middle East Report'', 45, International Crisis Group, 2005, p. 3. Quoted in Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Shia in Hasa ignored the ban on mourning ceremonies commemorating Ashura. When police broke them up three days of rampage ensued—burned cars, attacked banks, looted shops—centered around Qatif. At least 17 Shia were killed. In February 1980 disturbances were "less spontaneous" and even bloodier.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage'', Simon and Schuster, (2001), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, broadcasts from Iran in the name of the Islamic Revolutionary Organization attacked the monarchy, telling listeners, "Kings despoil a country when they enter it and make the noblest of its people its meanest ... This is the nature of monarchy, which is rejected by Islam."&lt;ref&gt;BBC monitoring service from March 1980 quoted in [[William B. Quandt]], ''Saudi Arabia in the 1980s'', Brookings Institution, 1981, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1993, Saudi Shia had abandoned uncompromising demands and some of al-Saffar's followers met with [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] with promises made for reform. In 2005 the new [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] also relaxed some restrictions on the Shia.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pp. 238, 240&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shia continue to be arrested for commemorating Ashura as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]] [http://hrw.org/englishwr2k7/docs/2007/01/11/saudia14717.htm Saudi Arabia – Events of 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225200425/http://hrw.org/englishwr2k7/docs/2007/01/11/saudia14717.htm |date=2007-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006, amidst escalating tensions in Iraq, 38 high ranking Saudi clerics called on Sunni Muslims around the world to "mobilise against Shiites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006\12\12\story_12-12-2006_pg4_8|title= Your Right To Know|publisher=Daily Times|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shia Grand Ayatollah [[Naser Makarem Shirazi]] is reported to have responded:
{{Quote|The Wahhabis ignore the occupation of Islam's first [[Qibla]]h by Israel, and instead focus on declaring Takfiring fatwas against Shias.&lt;ref&gt;Press release by [[Iranian Students News Agency]]: [http://www.isna.ir/Main/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-865630&amp;Lang=P www.isna.ir] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222034411/http://www.isna.ir/Main/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-865630&amp;Lang=P |date=December 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* Saudi Sunni
A large fraction of the foreign Sunni extremists who have entered Iraq to fight against Shia and the American occupation are thought to be Saudis. According to one estimate, of the approximately 1,200 foreign fighters captured in Syria between summer 2003 and summer 2005, 85% were Saudis.&lt;ref name="baer" /&gt;

Another reflection of grassroots Wahhabi or Saudi antipathy to Shia was a statement by Saudi cleric Nasir al-Umar, who accused Iraqi Shias of close ties to the United States and argued that both were enemies of Muslims everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Toby "The Iraq Effect in Saudi Arbia, ''Middle East Report'' 237 (Winter 2005), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

* Al-Qaeda
Some Wahabi groups, often labeled{{By whom|date=September 2014}} as ''[[takfiri]]'' and sometimes linked{{By whom|date=September 2014}} to Al-Qaeda, have even advocated the persecution of the Shia as heretics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051024004108/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/407AAE91-AF72-45D7-83E9-486063C0E5EA.htm Al-Zarqawi declares war on Iraqi Shia] aljazeera.net, 14 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=18911|title=Site under maintenance|work=aljazeera.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such groups have been allegedly responsible for violent attacks and suicide bombings at Shi'a gatherings at mosques and shrines, most notably in Iraq during the Ashura mourning ceremonies where hundreds of Shias were killed in coordinated suicide bombings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4276367.stm Blasts target Iraq's Shia Muslims on the eve of Ashura] 18 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/sep/16iraq.htm Latest Iraq blast targets Shia mosque, September 16, 2005] "Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, vowed to wage an 'all-out war' on the country's Shia majority"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050918/news_7n18iraq.html Four days after al-Qaeda in Iraq declared all-out war on the Shiite majority, more than 250 people have been killed]" San Diego Union Tribune, September 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; but also in Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, in a video message, Al-Qaeda deputy Dr [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] directed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, not to attack civilian targets but to focus on the occupation troops. His call seems to have been ignored, or swept away in the increasing tensions of Iraq under occupation.

==== Lebanon ====
Though sectarian tensions in Lebanon were at their height during the [[Lebanese Civil War]], the Shia–Sunni relations were not the main conflict of the war. The Shia party/militia of [[Hezbollah]] emerged in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War as one of the strongest forces following the Israeli withdrawal in the year 2000, and the collapse of the [[South Lebanese Army]] in the South. The tensions blew into a [[2008 conflict in Lebanon|limited warfare]] between Shia dominated and Sunni dominated political alliances in 2008.

With the eruption of the Syrian Civil War, [[Bab al-Tibbaneh, Jabal Mohsen clashes|tensions]] increased between the Shia-affiliated Alawites and Sunnis of Tripoli, erupting twice into deadly violence—in June 2011, and the [[2012 sectarian clashes in Lebanon|second time in February 2012]]. The Syrian war has affected Hezbollah, which was once lauded by both Sunnis and Shi'ites for its battles against Israel, but now has lost support from many Sunnis for its military assistance to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

==== Jordan ====
{{Main|Islam in Jordan}}
Although the country of Jordan is 95% Sunni and has not seen any Shia–Sunni fighting within, it has played a part in the recent Shia-Sunni strife. It is the home country of anti-Shia insurgent [[Raed Mansour al-Banna]], who died perpetrating one of Iraq's worst suicide bombings in the city of Al-Hillah. Al-Banna killed 125 Shia and wounded another 150 in the [[2005 Al Hillah bombing]] of a police recruiting station and adjacent open air market. In March 2005 [[Salt, Jordan|Salt]], al-Banna's home town, saw a three-day wake for al-Banna who Jordanian newspapers and celebrants proclaimed a [[Shahid|martyr]] to Islam, which by definition made the Shia victims "infidels whose murder was justified." Following the wake Shia mobs in Iraq attacked the Jordanian embassy on March 20, 2005. Ambassadors were withdrawn from both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A50921-2005Mar20?language=printer|title=Washington Post: Breaking News, World, US, DC News &amp; Analysis|work=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nasr, Vali 2006 p.227-8"&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'' (Norton, 2006), pp. 227–28&lt;/ref&gt; All this resulted despite the strong filial bonds, ties of commerce, and traditional friendship between the two neighboring countries.&lt;ref name="Nasr, Vali 2006 p.227-8" /&gt;

==== Yemen ====
{{Main|Islam in Yemen}}
{{See also|Human rights in Yemen|Religion in Yemen}}
Muslims in Yemen include the majority Shafi'i (Sunni) and the minority Zaidi (Shia). Zaidi are sometimes called "Fiver Shia" instead of Twelver Shia because they recognize the first four of the Twelve Imams but accept [[Zayd ibn Ali]] as their "Fifth Imām" rather than his brother [[Muhammad al-Baqir]]. Shia–Sunni conflict in Yemen involves the [[Shia insurgency in Yemen|Shia insurgency]] in northern Yemen.&lt;ref name="scribd.com" /&gt;

Both Shia and Sunni dissidents in Yemen have similar complaints about the government—cooperation with the American government and an alleged failure to following Sharia law&lt;ref&gt;Yemen Facing Insurgency on Two Fronts, By Stephen Ulph (see above)&lt;/ref&gt;—but it's the Shia who have allegedly been singled out for government crackdown.

During and after the US-led invasion of Iraq, members of the Zaidi-Shia community protested after Friday prayers every week outside mosques, particularly the [[Great Mosque of Sana'a|Grand Mosque]] in [[Sana'a]], during which they shouted anti-US and anti-Israeli slogans, and criticised the government's close ties to America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE310012007?open&amp;of=ENG-366 Amnesty Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217133641/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE310012007?open&amp;of=ENG-366 |date=2007-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These protests were led by ex-parliament member and Imam, Bader Eddine al-Houthi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/040709/2004070905.html Yemeni President: al-Houthi is an ill man, mentally abnormal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930200815/http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/040709/2004070905.html |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response the Yemeni government has implemented a campaign to crush to the Zaidi-Shia rebellion"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3863463.stm Clashes 'leave 118 dead' in Yemen], [[BBC]] report&lt;/ref&gt; and harass journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Yemen: [http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/yemen/document.do?id=ENGMDE310142005 Harassment of journalists must stop] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202124308/http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/yemen/document.do?id=ENGMDE310142005 |date=2006-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 2015 suicide bombing of two mosques (used mainly by supporters of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] Shia-led [[Houthi]] rebel movement), in the Yemeni capital of [[Sana'a|Sanaa]], killed at least 137 people and wounded 300. The Sunni [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] movement claimed responsibility, issuing a statement saying: "Let the polytheist Houthis know that the soldiers of the Islamic State will not rest until we have uprooted them." Both the Sunni [[al-Qaeda]] and "Islamic State" consider Shia Muslims to be heretics.&lt;ref name=BBC-yemen&gt;{{cite news|title=Yemen crisis: Islamic State claims Sanaa mosque attacks|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31989844|accessdate=21 March 2015|agency=BBC News|date=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bahrain ====
{{Main|Al Bandar report|Islam in Bahrain}}
The small [[Persian Gulf]] island state of Bahrain has a Shia majority but is ruled by Sunni [[Al Khalifa family]] as a [[constitutional monarchy]], with Sunni dominating the ruling class and military and disproportionately represented in the business and landownership.&lt;ref&gt;Momen, Moojan, ''Introduction to Shi'i Islam'', Yale University Press, 1985, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CIA World Factbook, [[Al Wefaq]] the largest Shia political society, won the largest number of seats in the elected chamber of the legislature. However, Shia discontent has resurfaced in recent years with street demonstrations and occasional low-level violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ba.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahrain has many disaffected unemployed youths and many have protested Sheikh [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]]'s efforts to create a parliament as merely a "cooptation of the [[effendi]]s", i.e. traditional elders and notables. Bahrain's 2002 election was widely boycotted by Shia. Mass demonstrations have been held in favor of full-fledged democracy in March and June 2005, against an alleged insult to Ayatollah Khamenei in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pp. 234–35&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pakistan ====
{{Main|Sectarian violence in Pakistan|Shia Islam in Pakistan|Islam in Pakistan}}
Pakistan's citizens have had serious Shia-Sunni discord. Almost 80% of Pakistan's Muslim population is Sunni, with 20% being Shia, but this Shia minority forms the second largest Shia population of any country,&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'' (Norton), 2006, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; larger than the Shia majority in Iraq.

Until recently Shia–Sunni relations have been cordial, and a majority of people of both sects participated in the creation the state of Pakistan in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Despite the fact that Pakistan is a Sunni majority country, Shias have been elected to top offices and played an important part in the country's politics. [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], the father of the nation who served as the first Governor-General of Pakistan was a Shia. Several other top Pakistani Generals such as General [[Muhammad Musa]]. [[President of Pakistan|Pakistan's President]] [[Yahya Khan]]{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} were Shia. Former President [[Asif Ali Zardari]] is a Shia. There are many intermarriages between Shia and Sunnis in Pakistan.

Unfortunately, from 1987–2007, "as many as 4,000 people are estimated to have died" in Shia-Sunni sectarian fighting in Pakistan", 300 being killed in 2006.&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0202/p01s02-wosc.html|title=Shiite-Sunni conflict rises in Pakistan|author=The Christian Science Monitor|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the culprits blamed for the killing are Al-Qaeda working "with local sectarian groups" to kill what they perceive as Shia [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates]], and "foreign powers ... trying to sow discord."&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com" /&gt; Most violence takes place in the largest province of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and the country's commercial and financial capital, [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name="Pakistan's Shia-Sunni divide"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3045122.stm | work=BBC News | title=Pakistan's Shia-Sunni divide | date=June 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been conflagrations in the provinces of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Balochistan]] and [[Azad Kashmir]],&lt;ref name="Pakistan's Shia-Sunni divide" /&gt; with several hundreds of Shia [[Hazara people|Hazara]] killed in Balochistan killed since 2008.&lt;ref name=hrw-baluchistan&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan: Rampant Killings of Shia by Extremists|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/06/29/pakistan-rampant-killings-shia-extremists|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=17 December 2014|date=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab states especially Saudi Arabia and [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] states have been funding extremist [[Deobandi]] Sunnis and [[Wahhabi]]s in Pakistan, since the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghan Jihad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cD36RbtSKNkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Frontline Pakistan|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Iran has been funding Shia militant groups such as [[Sipah-e-Muhammad Pakistan]], resulting in tit-for-tat attacks on each other.&lt;ref name="Pakistan's Shia-Sunni divide" /&gt; Pakistan has become a battleground between Saudi Arabia-funded Deobandi Sunni and Wahhabis and Iran-funded Shia resulting in the deaths of thousands of innocent Muslims.

* Background
Some see a precursor of Pakistani Shia–Sunni strife in the April 1979 execution of deposed President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on questionable charges by [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]. Ali Bhutto was Shia, Zia ul-Haq a Sunni.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization]] that followed was resisted by Shia who saw it as "Sunnification" as the laws and regulations were based on Sunni ''[[fiqh]]''. In July 1980, 25,000 Shia protested the [[Islamization]] laws in the capital [[Islamabad]]. Further exacerbating the situation was the dislike between Shia leader Imam Khomeini and General Zia ul-Haq.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pp. 161–62&lt;/ref&gt;

Shia formed student associations and a Shia party, Sunni began to form sectarian militias recruited from Deobandi and [[Ahl al-Hadith]] madrasahs. Preaching against the Shia in Pakistan was cleric [[Israr Ahmed]]. Muhammad Manzour Numani, a senior Indian cleric with close ties to Saudi Arabia published a book entitled ''Iranian Revolution: Imam Khomeini and Shiism''. The book, which "became the gospel of Deobandi militants" in the 1980s, attacked Khomeini and argued the excesses of the Islamic revolution were proof that Shiism was not the doctrine of misguided brothers, but beyond the Islamic pale.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' Norton, (2006), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Shia groups in Pakistan include the [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] and [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]], offshoots of the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]] (JUI). The groups demand the expulsion of all Shias from Pakistan and have killed hundreds of Pakistani Shias between 1996 and 1999.&lt;ref name="Rashid, Taliban 2000, p.194"&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; As in Iraq they "targeted Shia in their holy places and mosques, especially during times of communal prayer." &lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' Norton, (2006), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; From January to May 1997, Sunni terror groups assassinated 75 Shia community leaders "in a systematic attempt to remove Shias from positions of authority."&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' Norton, (2006), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Lashkar-e-Jhangvi has declared Shia to be "American agents" and the "near enemy" in global jihad.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' Norton, (2006), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an early Shia–Sunni ''[[Fitna (word)|fitna]]'' shootout occurred in [[Kurram Valley|Kurram]], one of the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|tribal agencies]] of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Northwest Pakistan]], where the [[Pashtun people|Pushtun]] population was split between Sunnis and Shia. In September 1996 more than 200 people were killed when a gun battle between teenage Shia and Sunni escalated into a communal war that lasted five days. Women and children were kidnapped and gunmen even executed out-of-towners who were staying at a local hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Robert, ''Soldiers of Allah: With Islamic Warriors in Afghanistan and Pakistan'', New York: Vintage Departures, 2001, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

"Over 80,000 Pakistani Islamic militants have trained and fought with the Taliban since 1994. They form a hardcore of Islamic activists, ever-ready to carry out a similar Taliban-style Islamic revolution in Pakistan.", according to Pakistani journalist [[Ahmed Rashid]].&lt;ref name="Rashid, Taliban 2000, p.194" /&gt;

==== Afghanistan ====
{{Main|Shia Islam in Afghanistan|Islam in Afghanistan}}
Shia–Sunni strife in Pakistan is strongly intertwined with that in Afghanistan. Though now deposed, the anti-Shia Afghan [[Taliban]] regime helped anti-Shia Pakistani groups and vice versa. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan, have sent thousands of volunteers to fight with the Taliban regime and "in return the Taliban gave sanctuary to their leaders in the Afghan capital of Kabul."&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Shia–Sunni strife inside of Afghanistan has mainly been a function of the puritanical Sunni Taliban's clashes with Shia Afghans, primarily the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic group.

In 1998 more than 8,000 noncombatants were killed when the Taliban [[Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif 1997-1998#Recapture of Mazar-e Sharif|attacked]] [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] and [[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamiyan]] where many Hazaras live.&lt;ref&gt;Goodson, ''Afghanistan's Endless War,'' (2001), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the slaughter was indiscriminate, but many were Shia targeted by the Taliban. Taliban commander and governor Mullah Niazi banned prayer at Shia mosques&lt;ref&gt;Rashid,''Taliban'' (2000), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; and expressed takfir of the Shia in a declaration from Mazar's central mosque:
{{Quote|Last year you rebelled against us and killed us. From all your homes you shot at us. Now we are here to deal with you. The Hazaras are not Muslims and now we have to kill Hazaras. You must either accept to be Muslims or leave Afghanistan. Wherever you go, we will catch you. If you go up we will pull you down by your feet; if you hide below, we will pull you up by your hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-03.htm#P186_38364|title=The Massacre in Mazar-I Sharif|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Assisting the Taliban in the murder of Iranian diplomatic and intelligence officials at the Iranian Consulate in Mazar were "several Pakistani militants of the anti-Shia, Sipah-e-Sahaba party."&lt;ref&gt;Rashid,''Taliban'' (2000), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nigeria ====
{{Main|Islam in Nigeria|Shia Islam in Nigeria}}
In Nigeria—the most populous country in Africa—until recently almost all Muslims were Sunni.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/with-iran-backed-conversions-shiites-gain-ground-in-africa-1463046768|title=With Iran-Backed Conversions, Shiites Gain Ground in Africa|last=Trofimov|first=Yaroslav|date=2016-05-12|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-03-14|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, estimates of the number of Nigeria's 90–95 million Muslims who are Shia vary from between 20 million (Shia estimate), to less than five million (Sunni estimate).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-03-08/as-trump-makes-threats-iran-makes-friends|title=As Trump Makes Threats, Iran Makes Friends|last=Abu-Nasr|first=Donna|date=2017-03-08|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, [[Ibrahim Zakzaky|Ibrahim El-Zakzaky]]—a Nigerian admirer of the [[Iranian Revolution]] who lived in Iran for some years and converted to Shia Islam—established the [[Islamic Movement (Nigeria)|Islamic Movement of Nigeria]]. The movement has established "more than 300 schools, Islamic centers, a newspaper, guards and a `martyrs’ foundation`".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Its network is similar to that of [[Hezbollah]] in Lebanon, with a focus on Iran, its [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]], and fighting America as the enemy of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.abna24.com/news/africa/nigerian-muslims-we-love-imam-khamenei-we-fight-to-death-for-iran_816759.html|title=Nigerian Muslims: We love Imam Khamenei, we fight to death for Iran|last=Bloomberg|date=2017-03-10|access-date=2017-03-14|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a former U.S. State Department specialist on Nigeria, Matthew Page, the Islamic Movement receives "about $10,000 a month" in Iranian funding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of the converted are poor Muslims.

The Shia campaign has clashed with Saudi Arabian, which also funds religious centers, school, and trains students and clerics, but as part of an effort to spread its competing [[International propagation of Salafism and Wahhabism|Wahabbi]] interpretation of Islam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Wikileaks, "Saudi cables" released in 2015 "reveal concern" about "Iran-driven Shiite expansion from Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Nigeria" to Shia Islam has taken place in Nigeria since the Iranian Revolution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Shia Muslims protest that they have been persecuted by the Nigerian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gatewayhouse.in/85062/|title=A new fault line in Nigeria|date=20 January 2016|work=GateWay House|author=Ajagbe, Kunle|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 Nigerian President General [[Sani Abacha]] accused Ibrahim El-Zakzaky &lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; of being a Shia. In December 2015 the Nigerian government alleged that the Islamic Movement attempted to kill Nigeria's army chief-of-staff. In retaliation, troops [[2015 Zaria massacre|killed more than 300]] Shiites in the city of [[Zaria]]. Hundreds of El-Zakzaky's followers were also arrested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35168211|title=Mass graves for '300 Shia Nigerians' in Zaria|date=23 December 2015|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.abna24.com/service/africa/archive/2016/01/24/731742/story.html|title=Zaria Massacre: Army deliberately targets reproductive organs of IMN's women; They shouted 'there will never be Shia in Nigeria'|date=24 January 2016|work=[[AhlulBayt News Agency]]|author=Elbinawi, Haruni|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, El-Zakzaky was still imprisoned.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== South East Asia ====
Islam is the dominant religion in [[Indonesia]], which also has a larger Muslim population than any other country in the world, with approximately 202.9 million identified as Muslim (88.2% of the total population) as of 2009.&lt;ref name="mgmpPRC"&gt;{{Citation|editor-last=Miller |editor-first=Tracy |date=October 2009 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |title=Mapping the Global Muslim Population: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World’s Muslim Population |format=PDF |url=http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf |accessdate=2009-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010050756/http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, in 2015, Sunni clerics denounced the Shia as "heretics", and the mayor of [[Bogor]] proposed banning the Shia [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] holy day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.abna24.com/service/east-asia/archive/2015/10/31/717780/story.html |title=Indonesia Shia group accuse extremist Sunni leaders of violating constitution |date=31 October 2015|work=ABNA|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shia community has also been subject to hate campaigns and intimidation, with fears of this escalating into violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/attacks-planned-indonesias-shia-community-govt-says/ |title=Attacks Planned Against Indonesia's Shia Community, Govt Says |work=Jakarta Globe|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States ====
In late 2006 or early 2007, in what journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] called ''The Redirection'', the United States changed its policy in the Muslim world, shifting its support from the Shia to the Sunni, with the goal of "containing" Iran and as a by-product bolstering Sunni extremist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Seymour M. |last=Hersh |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/03/05/070305fa_fact_hersh |title=Annals of National Security: The Redirection |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=March 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Engel, who is an NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent, wrote an article in late 2011 alleging that the United States Government is pro-Sunni and anti-Shia.

As of March 2015, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (or ISIS/ISIL, Daesh), a [[Salafi jihadism|Salafi jihadi]] [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] militant group and self-proclaimed [[caliphate]] and [[Islamic state]] led by Sunni Arabs from Iraq and Syria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kurds accused of "ethnic cleansing" by Syria rebels|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/kurds-accused-ethnic-cleansing-syria-rebels-isis/|accessdate=June 22, 2015|website=cbsnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; had control over territory occupied by ten million people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/13/us-mideast-crisis-syria-icrc-idUSKBN0M921N20150313|title=Islamic State-controlled parts of Syria, Iraq largely out of reach: Red Cross|work=Reuters|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]], as well as limited territorial control in some other countries.&lt;ref name="Pakistani Taliban pledges allegiance to ISIL"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan Taliban splinter group vows allegiance to Islamic State|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/18/us-pakistan-militants-is-idUSKCN0J20YQ20141118|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=18 November 2014|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISIL gains supporters"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zavadski|first=Katie|title=ISIS Now Has a Network of Military Affiliates in 11 Countries Around the World|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/11/isis-now-has-military-allies-in-11-countries.html|accessdate=25 November 2014|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations has held ISIS responsible for human rights abuses and [[war crime]]s, and [[Amnesty International]] has reported [[ethnic cleansing]] by the group on a "historic scale", including attacks on Shia Muslims.

According to [[Shia rights watch]], in 2014 ISIS forces killed over 1,700 Shia civilians at Camp Speicher in [[Tikrit]] Iraq, and 670 Shia prisoners at the detention facility on the outskirts of [[Mosul]].&lt;ref name=ICAH&gt;{{cite web|title=ISIS Crimes against Humanity For Immediate release|url=http://shiarightswatch.org/?p=6045|website=Shia Rights Watch|accessdate=7 July 2015|date=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, the New York Times wrote that as ISIS has "seized vast territories" in western and northern Iraq, there have been "frequent accounts of fighters’ capturing groups of people and releasing the Sunnis while the Shiites are singled out for execution". The report listed questions ISIS uses to "tell whether a person is a Sunni or a Shiite"—What is your name? Where do you live? How do you pray?

Shia militias fighting ISIS have also been accused of atrocities.

==Unity efforts==
In a special interview broadcast on [[Al Jazeera]] on February 14, 2007, former Iranian president and chairman of the [[Expediency Discernment Council]] of Iran, Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and highly influential Sunni scholar Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, "stressed the impermissibility of the fighting between the Sunnis and the Shi’is" and the need to "be aware of the conspiracies of the forces of [[hegemony]] and [[Zionism]] which aim to weaken [Islam] and tear it apart in Iraq."&lt;ref name="mideastwire.com"/&gt;

Even on this occasion there were differences, with Rafsanjani openly asking "more than once who started" the inter-Muslim killing in Iraq, and Al-Qaradawi denying claims by Rafsanjani that he knew where "those arriving to Iraq to blow Shi’i shrines up are coming from".&lt;ref name="mideastwire.com"/&gt;

===Saudi-Iran summit===
In a milestone for the two countries' relations, on March 3, 2007 King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad held an extraordinary [[Summit (meeting)|summit]] meeting. They displayed mutual warmth with hugs and smiles for cameras and
promised "a thaw in relations between the two regional powers but stopped short of agreeing on any concrete plans to tackle the escalating sectarian and political crises throughout the Middle East."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to Tehran, Ahmadinejad declared that:
{{Quote|Both Iran and Saudi Arabia are aware of the enemies' conspiracies. We decided to take measures to confront such plots. Hopefully, this will strengthen Muslim countries against oppressive pressure by the imperialist front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saudi officials had no comment about Ahmadinejad's statements, but the Saudi official government news agency did say:
{{Quote|The two leaders affirmed that the greatest danger presently threatening the Islamic nation is the attempt to fuel the fire of strife between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, and that efforts must concentrate on countering these attempts and closing ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naharnet.com/domino/tn/NewsDesk.nsf/getstory?openform&amp;AA7232A386FAF163C2257294002E63D9|title=Naharnet – Lebanon's leading news destination|work=Naharnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince [[Saud bin Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz]] said:
{{Quote|The two parties have agreed to stop any attempt aimed at spreading sectarian strife in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/3/4/worldupdates/2007-03-04T095839Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_-289931-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates|title=Archives|work=thestar.com.my|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903122054/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F3%2F4%2Fworldupdates%2F2007-03-04T095839Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_-289931-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates|archivedate=2009-09-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Steven Garasai Tari''' (1971 – 29 August 2013), also known as '''Black Jesus''', was a [[Papua New Guinea]]n religious figure, leader of a Christian-influenced [[cargo cult]], who claimed to be the [[Messiah]] or the [[Christ]], and is notorious for alleged [[rape]] and [[murder]].

He was convicted of four counts of rape in 2010 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He escaped in March 2013, and remained at large for several months, until he was killed by villagers on 29 August 2013.&lt;ref name=death/&gt;

==Early life==
Tari was born on [[Manus Island]] in 1971. He studied to become a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] at Amron Bible College in [[Madang]], but left the school prematurely after rejecting the teachings of the [[Bible]], leaving behind both his clothing and his belongings. He retreated into the mountain village of [[Gal, Madong|Gal]], where he formed a personality cult around himself as the [[Messiah]], adopting the moniker "Black Jesus".&lt;ref name=murderingmessiah&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=439755&amp;in_page_id|title=The murdering Messiah|last=Shears|first=Richard|date=3 March 2007|work=[[Mail Online]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some reports, he was expelled from the school for theft.&lt;ref name=expelled&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=434980&amp;in_page_id=1811&amp;in_page_id=1811&amp;expand=true#StartComments|title=Police manhunt for cult leader who 'eats girls'|date=8 February 2007|work=[[Mail Online]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult leader==
Tari's cult, which is estimated to have numbered as many as 6,000, became notorious for its alleged use of "flower girls" who served as [[concubine]]s for Tari. The girls dress in scant clothing. The [[Lutheran Church]], very prominent in Papua New Guinea, declared Tari an "enemy of the church".&lt;ref name=islandsbusiness&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandsbusiness.com/islands_business/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=17104/overideSkinName=issueArticle-full.tpl|title=PNG: MADANG CULT WORRIES CHURCH AUTHORITIES|last=Matbob|first=Patrick|publisher=Islands Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tari was pursued by [[Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary]] police in 2005 as a result of his teachings, which included promises of material goods and well-being for the villagers' worship. Under recent law, intended to combat the widespread occurrence of cults in the country, it is illegal to make such promises.&lt;ref name=murderingmessiah/&gt;

The first rape/murder accusation against Tari involves the fate of Rita Herman, who joined the cult at age 13 as a personal "flower girl" of the self-styled messiah. According to accusations, in October 2006, Tari and a select circle of his ex-Lutheran aides, along with Barmarhal Herman, the girl's mother and reported "queen" of the flower girls, took 14-year-old Rita into a private tent where she was raped by Tari. Barmarhal instructed her daughter to submit, as she and her family would be blessed by Tari and would receive great gifts of material goods and wealth as reward for the ritual.&lt;ref name=girlcannibalized&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/16385/girl-cannibalised|title=Girl cannibalised|date=25 October 2006|work=Post-Courier, Papua New Guinea|publisher=ReligionNewsBlog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the rape, Tari killed the girl with multiple knife stabs. Barmarhal's other daughter had been previously jailed for being one of Tari's flower girls. Barmarhal has denied being present at the event.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article2366505.ece|title='Black Jesus' who terrorised jungle villages is captured|last=Marks|first=Kathy|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=17 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320013355/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article2366505.ece|archivedate=20 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tari was initially captured in 2005, but escaped prior to his trial with the help of a Lutheran pastor, Logan Sapus,&lt;ref name=islandsbusiness/&gt; who had been assigned to counsel him but became converted to Tari's cult instead. Back in the jungle, Tari cultivated an honour guard and recruited a new crop of flower girls from the remote villages, promising them blessings of wealth in exchange. Tari enlisted only virgins, reportedly some as young as 8 years old.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt; Tari ordered the destruction of rival Lutheran churches and terrorized nearby villages who would not submit to him.&lt;ref name=murderingmessiah/&gt; About 50 of Tari's followers, including about 30 flower girls, were rounded up in an operation in June 2006. Those followers publicly renounced Tari and reconciled with their churches.&lt;ref name=reconciliation&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.postcourier.com.pg/20061107/news01.htm|title=Cultists give up bad ways|date=7 November 2006|work=Papua New Guinea Post-Courier|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927064740/http://www.postcourier.com.pg/20061107/news01.htm|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture, escape and death==
In 2007, Tari was captured after rival villagers traveled into his mountain stronghold at Matepi village, in the [[Transgogol]] area of [[Madang Province]], and attacked and captured him. One of the villagers climbed into a tree to obtain a [[cellular telephone|cellphone signal]] and called the authorities.&lt;ref name=washhands&gt;{{cite news|url=http://canberra.yourguide.com.au/detail.asp?class=international%20news&amp;subclass=general&amp;story_id=566745&amp;category=General |title=PNG villagers wash hands of 'Black Jesus' |work=The Canberra Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920150729/http://www.canberra.yourguide.com.au/detail.asp?class=international%20news |archivedate=20 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tari's appearance in court was delayed due to the injuries he suffered in that assault.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6469281.stm|title=PNG cult head faces murder charge|last=Mercer|first=Phil|date=20 March 2007|work=[[BBC Online]]|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in court in October 2007 charged with sexual offences. The claims of murder were never tested in court. He argued in his defence that "Those women were flower-girls and this was the work of the minister and permitted by the religion. And I don’t know if the charges laid against me are wrong or right." Because he had no legal representation the trial was adjourned until December. He was held in Madang's Beon Prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandsbusiness.com/islands_business/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=17749/overideSkinName=issueArticle-full.tpl|title=Black Jesus awaits trial|last=Matbob|first=Patrick|publisher=Islands Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010 it was reported that Tari again attempted escape from custody but was caught quickly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.postcourier.com.pg/20100423/news03.htm|title=Jailed cult leader recaptured after dash for freedom|last=Evara|first=Rosalyn|date=23 April 2010|work=PNG Post-Courier Online|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616195049/http://www.postcourier.com.pg/20100423/news03.htm|archivedate=16 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010 he was found guilty of four counts of rape, and sentenced to twenty years in prison.&lt;ref name=death /&gt;&lt;ref name = "ilya"&gt;Ilya Gridneff, Papua New Guinea Correspondent, "[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/pngs-black-jesus-guilty-of-rape-20101008-16avj.html PNG's Black Jesus guilty of rape]", ''The Sunday Morning Herald'', 8 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 2013, Tari escaped with 40 other prisoners in a mass breakout from Beon Prison Camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shears|first=Richard|title='Cannibal killer' known as Black Jesus breaks out of jail with FORTY EIGHT others|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2297437/Cannibal-killer-Stephen-Tari-known-Black-Jesus-breaks-Papua-New-Guinea-jail-FORTY-EIGHT-others.html|accessdate=24 March 2013|newspaper=Mail Online|date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 August, police reported that Tari had been killed by the villagers in Gal, a small Madang village, two days earlier, allegedly after murdering a local woman.&lt;ref name=death&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-30/an-png-black-jesus-cult-murder/4925528 "Angry PNG villagers kill 'Black Jesus' cult leader"], Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 30 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation is pending, although national newspapers have reported that Tari was "chopped to death" by the angry villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kathy Marks |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/hacked-slashed-and-castrated-how-cannibal-cult-leader-black-jesus-steven-tari-met-his-death-8795240.html |title=Hacked, slashed and castrated: How 'cannibal' cult leader ‘Black Jesus’ Steven Tari met his death - Australasia - World |publisher=The Independent |date=2013-07-29 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="800">A '''sub-dean''' is a [[priest]] or [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] who acts as an assistant to a [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] either in church circuit or an academic institution. He or she is, however, not a '''vice-dean'''. A vice-dean is a person who can deputize a dean whereas a sub-dean can only assist or carry out assignments as may be delegated to him or her by a dean. A vice-dean can exercise the powers of a dean in his or her absence but a sub-dean only report to a dean and does not have the power of a dean.

The '''Undavalli Caves''', a [[Monolithic architecture|monolithic]] example of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]] and one of the finest testimonials to ancient ''viswakarma sthapathis'', are located in [[Undavalli]] of [[Guntur District|Guntur district]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. The caves are located 6&amp;nbsp;km south west from [[Vijayawada]], 22&amp;nbsp;km north east of [[Guntur City]] of [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Andhra Pradesh]]. It is one of the centrally protected [[Monuments of National Importance|monuments of national importance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centrally Protected Monuments|url=http://asihyd.ap.nic.in/monuments.html|website=Archeological Survey of India|accessdate=27 May 2017|language=en|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626104454/http://asihyd.ap.nic.in/monuments.html|archivedate=26 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

These caves are said to be found in 7th century. They are associated with the Vishnukundi kings of 420-620 A.D.. These caves are dedicated to Anantha Padmanabha and Lord Narashimha. Buddhist monks used these as Rest Houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andhrawishesh.com/travel/609-spiritual-travels/59222-vijayawada-the-place-of-victory.html|title=Vijayawada-The place of Victory/Undavalli Caves|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology==
[[File:Padmanabaswami inside Undavalli Caves.jpg|thumb|Rock cut Hindu god in Caves]]

These caves were carved out of solid [[sandstone]] on a hillside in the 4th to 5th centuries A.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andhratourism.com/Caves_Andhra.htm|title=Undavalli Caves|publisher=andhratourism.com|accessdate=2006-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several caves and the best known largest one has four stories with a huge recreated statue of [[Vishnu]] in a reclining posture, sculpted from a single block of [[granite]] inside the second floor. Undavalli caves are an example of how many Buddhist artifacts and stupas in Andhra were converted into Hindu temples and deities. It was originally a [[Jainism|Jain]] cave resembling the architecture of Udayagiri and Khandgiri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.showcaves.com/english/in/misc/Undavalli.html

|publisher=showcaves.com
|accessdate=2006-08-19 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main cave is one of the earliest examples of [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] architecture, primarily primitive rock-cut [[monastery]] cells carved into the sandstone hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Unitarian Universalist Service Committee''' ('''UUSC''') is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], [[nonsectarian]] associate member organization of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] that works to provide [[disaster relief]] and promote [[human rights]] and [[social justice]] around the world.

UUSC was founded in May 1940 as the '''Unitarian Service Committee''' with the intended purpose of assisting European refugees endangered by Nazi persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Unitarian Service Committee Minutes, May 29, 1940, bms 16185, Box 1, Andover Harvard Theological Library&lt;/ref&gt;  The founding director was [[Robert Dexter]], who had served in a diplomatic role for the [[American Unitarian Association]] for more than a decade and had been moved, in particular, by the plight of refugees in Czechoslovakia, [[Norbert Capek|a country with a large Unitarian congregation]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Elisabeth Subak, ''Rescue and Flight: American Relief Workers who Defied the Nazis,'' University of Nebraska Press, 2010, https://www.amazon.com/dp/0803225253&lt;/ref&gt; The organization established an office in Lisbon and the first American Unitarians to be posted there were [[Waitstill Sharp|Rev. Waitstill Hastings Sharp]], a minister of the Unitarian Church in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts, and his wife [[Martha Sharp|Martha]].  Later, Rev. Charles Joy, [[Elisabeth Anthony Dexter]] and [[Noel Field]] were recruited to work in the organization's Lisbon and Marseille offices and they, along with many refugee volunteers, expanded the relief and emigration programs.  The Sharps were posthumously honored by Israel in 2006 as the second and third Americans to be added to the list of [[Righteous among the Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtontimes.com/upi/20060915-011828-9433r.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization’s first board of directors was chaired by [[William Emerson (American architect)|William Emerson]], the former dean of the [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning|MIT School of Architecture]]. Other board members included [[Harold Hitz Burton]], mayor of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and a future [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court justice]]; [[Percival Brundage]], senior partner in the [[Price Waterhouse]] and future budget director for President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]; Louise Wright, chairwoman of the voters department of government and foreign policy for the [[League of Women Voters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedarlane.org/97serms/s970209.html "The Unitarian Universalist Service Committee"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725121138/http://www.cedarlane.org/97serms/s970209.html |date=July 25, 2008 }}, by Roger Fritts, February 9, 1997, Cedar Lane Unitarian Universalist Church, Bethesda, Maryland&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, UUSC is active in coordinating relief efforts around the world and investigating reports of human rights abuses. UUSC has four program areas: Rights in Humanitarian Crisis, Economic Justice, Environmental Justice, and Civil Liberties. Its recent activities have focused on the conflict in [[Darfur]], organizing volunteers to help survivors of the Gulf Coast hurricanes, workers' rights and the human [[right to water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wickedlocal.com/cambridge/news/business/x1633043548 "Unitarian Universalist Service Committee moves national HQ to Central Square"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520011335/http://www.wickedlocal.com/cambridge/news/business/x1633043548 |date=May 20, 2011 }}, ''Wicked Local Cambridge'', October 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is also active in lobbying corporations engaged in business with governments that it has identified as abusing basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/20/business/fidelity.php "Activists pressure funds to drop Chinese stocks"], by Ross Kerber, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', March 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
