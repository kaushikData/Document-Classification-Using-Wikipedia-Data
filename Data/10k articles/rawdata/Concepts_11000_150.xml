'''Accident analysis''' is carried out in order to determine the cause or causes of an accident (that can result in single or multiple outcomes) so as to prevent further accidents of a similar kind. It is part of ''accident investigation or incident investigation.'' These analyses may be performed by a range of experts, including [[forensic scientists]], [[Forensic engineering#Forensic engineering|forensic engineers]] or [[health and safety]] advisers. Accident investigators, particularly those in the aircraft industry, are colloquially known as "'''tin-kickers'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=av7B9WySKhMC&amp;pg=PA6|title=Black Box: Why Air Safety Is No Accident|page=6|first=Nicholas|last=Faith|publisher=Zenith Imprint|year=1997|isbn=0-7603-0400-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health and safety]] and [[patient safety]] professionals prefer using the term "incident" in place of the term "accident". Its retrospective nature means that accident analysis is primarily an exercise of directed explanation; conducted using the theories or methods the analyst has to hand, which directs the way in which the events, aspects, or features of accident phenomena are highlighted and explained.

==Sequence==
Accident analysis is performed in four steps:
#'''Fact gathering''': After an accident happened a forensic process starts to gather all possibly relevant facts that may contribute to understanding the accident.
#'''Fact Analysis''': After the forensic process has been completed or at least delivered some results, the facts are put together to give a "big picture." The history of the accident is reconstructed and checked for consistency and plausibility.
#'''Conclusion Drawing''': If the accident history is sufficiently informative, conclusions can be drawn about causation and contributing factors.
#'''Counter-measures''': In some cases the development of counter-measures is desired or recommendations have to be issued to prevent further accidents of the same kind.

==Methods==
There exist numerous forms of Accident Analysis methods. These can be divided into three categories:

#'''Causal Analysis''' uses the principle of causality to determine the course of events. Though people casually speak of a "chain of events", results from Causal Analysis usually have the form of [[Directed acyclic graph|directed a-cyclic graphs]]{{spaced ndash}}the nodes being events and the edges the cause-effect relations. Methods of Causal Analysis differ in their respective notion of causation.
#'''Expert Analysis''' relies on the knowledge and experience of field experts. This form of analysis usually lacks a rigorous (formal/semiformal) methodological approach. This usually affects falsify-ability and objectivity of analyses. This is of importance when conclusions are heavily disputed among experts.
#'''Organizational Analysis''' relies on systemic theories of organization. Most theories imply that if a system's behaviour stayed within the bounds of the ideal organization then no accidents can occur. Organizational Analysis can be falsified and results from analyses can be checked for objectivity. Choosing an organizational theory for accident analysis comes from the assumption that the system to be analysed conforms to that theory.

==Models==

Many models have been described to characterise and analyse accidents. The book ''Enhancing Occupational Safety and Health'' is one source of further details on the different types of models used in accident analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Enhancing Occupational Safety and Health|date=2004|author=Taylor, G.A.|author2=Easter, K.M.|author3=Hegney, R.P.|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0750661976|pages=241&amp;ndash;245, see also pages 140–141 and pages 147–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using photographs to extract evidence==
{{See also|Forensic photography}}

Once all available data has been collected by accident scene investigators and law enforcement officers, camera matching, photogrammetry or rectification can be used to determine the exact location of physical evidence shown in the accident scene photos.
#'''Camera matching''': Camera matching uses accident scene photos that show various points of evidence. The technique uses CAD software to create a 3-dimensional model of the accident site and roadway surface. All survey data and photos are then imported into a three dimensional software package like 3D Studio Max. A virtual camera can be then be positioned relative to the 3D roadway surface. Physical evidence is then mapped from the photos onto the 3D roadway to create a three dimensional accident scene drawing.
#'''Photogrammetry''': [[Photogrammetry]] is used to determine the three-dimensional geometry of an object on the accident scene from the original two dimensional photos. The photographs can be used to extract evidence that may be lost after the accident is cleared. Photographs from several viewpoints are imported into software like PhotoModeler. The forensic engineer can then choose points common to each photo. The software will calculate the location of each point in a three dimensional coordinate system. 
#'''Rectification''': Photographic rectification is also used to analyze evidence that may not have been measured at the accident scene. Two dimensional rectification transforms a single photograph into a top-down view. Software like PC-Rect can be used to rectify a digital photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veritecheng.com/white-paper-forensic-accident-reconstruction/ Extracting Physical Evidence from Digital Photographs for use in Forensic Accident Reconstruction], David Danaher, P.E., Jeff Ball, Ph.D., P.E., and Mark Kittel, P.E 2012-06-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''age of majority''' is the threshold of adulthood as recognized or declared in law. It is the moment when [[minor (law)|minor]]s cease to be considered such and assume legal control over their persons, actions, and decisions, thus terminating the control and legal responsibilities of their parents or guardian over them. Most countries set the age of majority at 18. The word ''majority'' here refers to having greater years and being of full age as opposed to ''minority'', the state of being a minor. The law in a given jurisdiction may not actually use the term "age of majority". The term typically refers to a collection of laws bestowing the status of adulthood. The age of majority does not necessarily correspond to the mental or [[Sexual maturity|physical maturity]] of an individual.

Age of majority should not be confused with the [[Coming of age|age of maturity]], [[age of consent|age of sexual consent]], [[marriageable age]], [[school-leaving age]], [[drinking age]], [[driving age]], [[voting age]], [[smoking age]], [[gambling age]], etc., which each may be independent of and set at a different age from the age of majority.

Although a person may attain the age of majority in a particular jurisdiction, they may still be subject to age-based restrictions regarding matters such as the right to vote or stand for elective office, act as a judge, and many others.

==Explanation==
Age of majority can be confused with the similar concept of the '''age of [[license]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David R. Senn|author2=Richard A. Weems|title=Manual of Forensic Odontology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9u0MUnexdIC|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-5133-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=c9u0MUnexdIC&amp;pg=PA212 212]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also pertains to the threshold of adulthood but in a much broader and more abstract way. As a legal term of art, "license" means "permission", and it can implicate a legally enforceable right or privilege. Thus, an age of license is an age at which one has legal permission from government to do something. The age of majority, on the other hand, is legal ''recognition'' that one has grown into an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cornick|title=A Practical Guide to Family Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YcZhqGMFht0C|year=1995|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-314-04451-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YcZhqGMFht0C&amp;pg=PA229 229]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age of majority pertains solely to the acquisition of the legal control over one's person, decisions and actions, and the correlative termination of the legal authority of the parents (or guardian(s), in lieu of parent(s)) over the child’s person and affairs generally.

Many ages of license are correlated to the age of majority, but they are nonetheless legally distinct concepts. One need not have attained the age of majority to have permission to exercise certain rights and responsibilities. Some ages of license are actually higher than the age of majority. For example, to purchase [[alcoholic beverages]], the age of license is 21 in all U.S. states. Another example is the voting age, which prior to the 1970s was 21 in the US, as was the age of majority in all or most states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/publications/Turn-18.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republic of Ireland the age of majority is 18, but one must be over 21 years of age to stand for election to the Houses of the [[Oireachtas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/reference/checklists/checklist_at_what_age_can_i.html|title=At what age can I?|publisher=Citizens Information Board (Bord um Fhaisnéis do Shaoránaigh / BFS)|accessdate=12 January 2011|location=Dublin| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101228220852/http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/reference/checklists/checklist_at_what_age_can_i.html| archivedate= 28 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in Portugal the age of majority is 18, but one must be at least 25 years of age to run for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE PORTUGUESE REPUBLIC |url=http://app.parlamento.pt/site_antigo/ingles/cons_leg/Constitution_VII_revisao_definitive.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022091934/http://app.parlamento.pt/site_antigo/ingles/cons_leg/Constitution_VII_revisao_definitive.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A child who is legally [[emancipation of minors|emancipated]] by a court of competent jurisdiction automatically attains to their maturity upon the signing of the court order. Only emancipation confers the status of maturity before a person has actually reached the age of majority.

In almost all places, minors who are married are automatically emancipated. Some places also do the same for minors who are in the armed forces or who have a certain degree or diploma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostoncoop.net/lcd/emancipation/emancipation_deliverable.pdf Statutory and Judicial Emancipation of Minors in the United States], 2001–2002 analysis by law students of [[Northeastern University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
{{Refimprove section||date= September 2009}}
In many countries minors can be [[Emancipation of minors|emancipated]]: depending on jurisdiction, this may happen through acts such as [[marriage]], attaining economic self-sufficiency, obtaining an educational [[academic degree|degree]] or [[diploma]], or participating in a form of [[military service]]. In the United States, all states have some form of emancipation of minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Emancipation of minors | publisher = Cornell | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/emancipation_of_minors}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious law==
Religions have their own rules as to the [[Coming of age|age of maturity]], when a child is regarded to be an adult, at least for ritual purposes:
*[[Islam]]: A person having reached the age of 15 or having entered puberty before that age is considered ''bulugh'' (adult).
*[[Judaism]]: 13 years of age for males ([[Bar Mitzvah]]) and 12 years of age for females ([[Bat Mitzvah]]). Such persons are considered adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The age requirement for Bar/Bat mitzvah | work = My Jewish Learning | url = http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-age-requirement-for-barbat-mitzvah/2/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Roman Catholic Church]]: 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Iuris Canonici'', Canon 97, §1, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/cod-iuris-canonici/latin/documents/cic_liberI_lt.html#TITULUS_VI] (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anger management''' is a psycho-therapeutic program for [[anger]] prevention and control. It has been described as deploying anger successfully.&lt;ref name="Schwarts"&gt;Schwarts, Gil. July 2006. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lscDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=%22Anger%20management%22&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Anger%20management%22&amp;f=false Anger Management]'', July 2006 The Office Politic. Men's Health magazine. Emmaus, PA: Rodale, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Anger is frequently a result of frustration, or of feeling blocked or thwarted from something the subject feels is important. Anger can also be a defensive response to underlying fear or feelings of vulnerability or powerlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.union.edu/offices/health-counseling/counseling/_forms/anger-management.pdf|title=Anger Management|publisher=www.union.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anger management programs consider anger to be a motivation caused by an identifiable reason which can be logically analyzed, and if suitable worked toward.&lt;ref name="Schwarts" /&gt; 

== Overview ==

The ideal goal of anger management is to control and regulate [[anger]] so that it does not result in problems.  Anger is an active emotion that calls the person feeling it to respond.&lt;ref name="W. Doyle Gentry 2007"&gt;W. Doyle Gentry, Ph.D. 2007. ''Anger Management for Dummies''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} People get into anger issues because both the instigator and instigated lack interpersonal and social skills to maintain self-control.&lt;ref name="W. Doyle Gentry 2007"/&gt;{{rp|5}} They can train to respond to their anger as unwanted and unpleasant rather than react to its need.&lt;ref name="W. Doyle Gentry 2007"/&gt;{{rp|5}} [[Turning a blind eye]] or forgiveness is a tool to turn anger off.&lt;ref name="W. Doyle Gentry 2007"/&gt;{{rp|5}} Getting enough sleep, exercise and good diet are tools which can assist in preventing anger.&lt;ref name="W. Doyle Gentry 2007"/&gt;{{rp|6}} Professionals who deal with those who have trouble managing anger include occupational therapists, mental health counselors, drug and alcohol counselors, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists.

==History==

The negative effects of anger have been observed throughout history. Advice for countering seemingly uncontrollable rage has been offered by ancient philosophers, pious men, and modern psychologists. In ''[[de Ira]],''&lt;ref name="L.D.Reynolds, M.T.Griffin, E.Fantham"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVWcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=first+extant+copy+of+Seneca+de+beneficiis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LEsEVYjFK8vvaLOqgNAD&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20extant%20copy%20of%20Seneca%20de%20beneficiis&amp;f=false|author =L.

Spawforth|editor3= E. Eidinow) |isbn=0199545561| accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger]] (4 BC – 65 AD) advised for pre-emptively guarding against confrontational situations, perspective taking, and not inciting anger in anger-prone individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, L. A. (1928). De ira [Anger]. In J. W. Basore (Ed. and Trans.), Seneca's moral essays (Vol. 1). London: Heinemann. (Original work written about 45)&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers echoed Seneca with [[Galen]] recommending seeking out a mentor for aid in anger reduction.&lt;ref&gt;(Galen, C. (1963). On the Passions and errors of the soul (P.W. Harkins, Trans.). Columbus, OH: Ohio State University Press. (Original work written about 180)&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages, the people would serve as both examples of self-control and mediators of anger-induced disputes.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kemp, S.|author2=Strongman, K. T.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1995|title=Anger theory and management: A historical analysis|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|volume=108|issue=3|pages=397–417|pmid=7573610|jstor=1422897|doi=10.2307/1422897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of intercession for the common people from the wrath of local rulers abound in hagiographies. The story of [[St. Francis of Assisi]] and the metaphorical Wolf of Gubbio is one famous instance.

In modern times, the concept of controlling anger has translated into anger management programs based on the research of psychologists. Classical psychotherapy based anger management interventions originated in the 1970s. Success in treating [[anxiety]] with [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) interventions developed by Meichebaum inspired Novaco to modify the stress inoculation training to be suitable for anger management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Meichenbaum‚ D. H. |year=1975|title=Stress inoculation training|location=New York|publisher=Pergamon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Novaco‚ R. W.|year=1975|title=Anger control: The development and evaluation of an experimental treatment|location=Lexington‚ MA|publisher=D.C. Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress and anger are sufficiently similar that such a modification was able to create a successful branch of treatment. Both stress and anger are caused by external stimuli, mediated by internal processing, and expressed in either adaptive or maladaptive forms. Meichebaum, and later Novaco, used each aspect of experiencing the relevant emotion as an opportunity for improvement to the patient's overall well-being.

== Potential causes for development of problems ==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}

===Medical causes===
Drug addiction, [[alcoholism]], a [[Mental disability (disambiguation)|mental disability]], biochemical changes and [[PTSD]] can all lead to a person committing an aggressive act against another person. Not having sufficient skills on how to handle oneself when faced with aggression can lead to very undesirable outcomes. These factors are typically associated with a heightened chance of anger, but there are other, less-known factors that can lead to people acting in a negative way. Prolonged or intense anger and frustration contributes to physical conditions such as [[headache]]s, digestive problems, [[high blood pressure]] and [[heart disease]]. Problems dealing with angry feelings may be linked to psychological disorders such as anxiety or [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Angry outbursts can be a way of trying to cope with unhappiness or depression.

'''Migraines''': Frequent [[migraine]] can be associated with levels of aggression and the need for anger management. A 2013 study examined migraines and its association with anger problems in young children (m = 11.2 years of age).  The patients in the study were split into low migraine attack frequency (AF), intermediate AF, high frequency, and chronic migraine AF. The tendency for a participant to inhibit their anger and not lash out was found more in children with higher AF.  Children that qualified for low migraine AF actually had more anger expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tarantino, S.|author2=De Ranieri, C.|author3=Dionisi, C.|author4=Citti, M.|author5=Capuano, A.|author6=Galli, F.|author7=Valeriani, M.|displayauthors=etal|lastauthoramp=y|year=2013|title=Clinical features, anger management and anxiety: A possible correlation in migraine children|journal=The Journal of Headache and Pain|volume=14|issue=1|page=39|doi=10.1186/1129-2377-14-39|pmc=3653764|pmid=23651123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychosocial causes===
Psychosocial factors such as stress, abuse, poor social or familial situations, and poverty can cause anger problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://www.nasponline.org/publications/booksproducts/nas-cbiii-05-1001-009-r02.pdf|title=Children's Needs III|chapter=Anger and Aggression|author1=John E.

=== Trauma ===
A history of [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], particularly sexual trauma, can result in anger management problems.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

== Types of treatment ==

Some effective anger management techniques include relaxation techniques, monitored breathing exercises, [[cognitive restructuring]] and [[guided imagery|imagery]] (e.g. Stosny's '''H'''ealing imagery '''E'''xplain oneself emphatically what and why it makes you respond angrily '''A'''pply kindness and compassion to self '''L'''ove oneself '''S'''olving the co-morbid problems phases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200506/the-lion-tamer|title=The Lion Tamer|work=Psychology Today|author=Cecilia Capuzzi Simon|date=July 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;), problem solving,  improving communication strategies and interpersonal skills ('''DEAR MAN''' &amp; '''GIVE''').&lt;ref&gt;APA, apa.org 2013. ''Controlling anger before it controls you, [http://www.apa.org/topics/anger/control.aspx?item=4 Strategies To Keep Anger At Bay]'', part 4. Washington, DC: APA's Office of Publications and Databases&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.srmhp.org/0302/anger.html|title=Nonspecific Factors and the Efficacy of Psychosocial Treatments for Anger|publisher=srmhp.org|date=2005|volume=3|number=2|author1=Bunmi O. Olatunji|author2=Jeffery M. Lohr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are specific types of anger management treatment approaches supported by empirical studies.  Several of the studies examined used [[self-report]], which some psychologists{{who|date=August 2015}} feel could be a limitation for results. People do not want others to think of them as angry individuals, so their answers could be changed to fit how society wants them to behave.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program ===

The Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP) is a program that was used in a study consisting of [[Air Force]] families.  The families were assigned to either a traditional multi-couple group format or a self-directed book version focusing on relationship satisfaction and anger management skills.  There was a significant main effect for time related to both relationship satisfaction (pretest M = 49.8, SD = 17.6; post-test M = 53.8, SD = 17.6, F(1, 76) = 6.91, p &lt; .01), and anger management skills, (pretest M = 32.2, SD = 4.2; post-test M = 34.6, SD = 4.0, F(1, 74) = 31.79, p &lt; .001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Anderson, J. R.|author2=Stith, S. M.|author3=Johnson, M. D.|author4=Strachman-Miller, M. M.|author5=Amanor-Boadu, Y.|author6=Linkh, D. J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2013|title=Multi-couple group and self-directed PREP formats enhance relationship satisfaction and improve anger management skills in Air Force couples|journal=American Journal of Family Therapy|volume=41|issue=2|pages=121–133|doi=10.1080/01926187.2012.671104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-directed book version did not show as positive of results. Improving a couple's anger management skills can be a vital step in ensuring there are no violent outbreaks throughout the relationship.

=== Cognitive behavioral therapy ===

The use of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is frequent in anger management treatment.  By trying to get a patient to open up about their emotions and feelings and being driven to accomplish a specific task (in this case controlling anger), a person is cognitively motivated to use positive skills towards their behavior.

Studies show using a mix of CBT as well as other therapies on the participants/clients increased the effective usage of the anger management techniques and that they also felt more in control of their own anger. Personal changes like these can lead to less aggression and fewer violent acts. The use of play therapy with this is also found efficient in tackling anger issues among children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lianalowenstein.com/anger_frey_edited.pdf|title=Creative Strategies for the Treatment of Anger|author=Diane E Frey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive mentalization and personal development ===

This is a style that is commonly used in elementary schools for students expressing anger outbursts.  Researchers who have looked into the reason for young student anger have found that one common reason could be the inability to adjust socially.  Students that were selected for this study received a daily one-hour session throughout one week of school.  The researchers of the [[mentalization]] program educated children through group therapy in [[positive psychology]] and tried to do activities that put the child in a happy mood while interacting.  At the end of the week, research showed that there was a negative correlation between anger and social adjustment.  This process lowered the overall anger levels of the students involved in social adjustment deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rohini, N. S.|author2=Devi, R.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Management of anger and enhancement of social adjustment among school students with the application of positive therapy|journal=Indian Journal of Community Psychology|volume=7|issue=2|pp=249–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of [[personal development]] (PD) led to higher views of themselves and more positive [[self-esteem]].  Aggression has been shown to be a result of poor self-worth as well as thinking that those around us do not care or support us, so this PD is vital in helping change a person's [[self-perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Down, R.|author2=Willner, P.|author3=Watts, L.|author4=Griffiths, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Anger management groups for adolescents: A mixed-methods study of efficacy and treatment preferences|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|volume=16|issue=1|pages=33–52|doi=10.1177/1359104509341448|pmid=20223794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anger journaling ===
{{See also|Journal therapy|Writing therapy}}
Understanding one's own emotions can be a crucial piece of learning how to deal with anger.  Children who wrote down their negative emotions in an "anger diary" actually ended up improving their emotional understanding, which in turn led to less aggression.  When it comes to dealing with their emotions, children show the ability to learn best by seeing direct examples of instances that led to certain levels of anger. By seeing the reasons why they got angry, they can in the future try to avoid those actions or be prepared for the feeling they experience if they do find themselves doing something that typically results in them being angry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Renati, R.|author2=Cavioni, V.|author3=Zanetti, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title='Miss, I got mad today!' The Anger Diary, a tool to promote emotion regulation|journal=The International Journal of Emotional Education|volume=3|issue=1|pages=48–69|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303913674_Miss_I_got_mad_today_The_anger_diary_a_tool_to_promote_emotion_regulation_strategies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is not sufficient evidence of this needing to be implemented in elementary schools, but this activity is a common tool used in therapies, so it could lead to children writing down their negative feelings and anger and help them to re-evaluate their position and take personal time to cool down instead of lashing out and doing aggressive actions in person.

=== Other evidence-based approaches ===

Anger management interventions are based in cognitive behavioral techniques and follow in a three-step process.&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Beck, R.|author2=Fernandez, E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1998|title=Cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of anger: A meta-analysis|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=22|issue=1|pp=63–74|doi=10.1023/A:1018763902991}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the client learns to identify situations that can potentially trigger the feeling of anger. A situation that elicits anger is often referred to as an anger cue.&lt;ref name="Deffenbacher, L. J. 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Deffenbacher, L. J.|year=1999|title=Cognitive-behavioral conceptualization and treatment of anger|journal=Psychotherapy in Practice|volume=55|issue=3|pp=295–309|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(199903)55:3&lt;295::AID-JCLP3&gt;3.0.CO;2-A|pmid=10321745}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a potential trigger can be avoided, the individual can not only avoid unwanted outbursts, but also avoid internal conflict. Often anger occurs through automatic thought and irrational beliefs, these pose a problem for treatment because the patient may respond too quickly to change the thought or behavior. Wright, Day, &amp; Howells referred to this phenomenon as the "hijacking of the cognitive system by the emotional system".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wright, S.|author2=Day, A.|author3=Howells, K.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Mindfulness and the treatment of anger problems|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|volume=14|issue=5|pp=396–401|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2009.06.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Second, relaxation techniques are taught as appropriate responses to the identified situations. Common techniques include regulating breathing and physically removing themselves from the situation. Finally, [[role-play]] is used to practice the application of the learned techniques for future encounters with anger-inducing situations in the individual's life. The end result of repetition is an automatic response of learned beneficial techniques.&lt;ref name="Beck" /&gt; Modifications of each general step result in distinctive programs. Additionally, different fields of psychology will change aspects of the above three-step process, which is primarily based in cognitive-behavioral therapy. Group, family, and relaxation only therapies each contribute to the wider range of available anger management programs.

[[Relaxation therapy]] can reduce cognition and motivations to act out, and through relaxation, clients gain coping skills to better manage their anger. This therapy addresses various aspects of anger such as physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and social. These aspects combined are what make relaxation an effective treatment for anger.&lt;ref name="Deffenbacher, L. J. 1999"/&gt; The mindfulness therapy technique attempts to teach clients acceptance of bodily sensations and emotions. Mindfulness originated in Eastern spiritual traditions that are practiced through meditation. A two-prong component of mindfulness includes: self-regulation and orientation toward the present moment. The center of this therapy technique is experiencing the present moment in a non-judgmental manner that is reflective of meditation. In practice, clients observe breathing, sitting and walking during meditations. The goal is for clients to understand that his or her thoughts of anger are merely thoughts rather than reality. Mindfulness is also a technique used in the relaxation approach, because the technique halts physiological arousal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Rational emotive behavior therapy]] explains anger through the client's beliefs and emotion, rather than the event itself. The concept involves clients interpreting events in a rational manner in order to avoid irrational thoughts that lead to anger. Delayed reaction technique is when clients attempt to uncover what is making them angry before acting out on their anger. This allows them to have time to change what is making them angry and increase time before their response; this encourages thought on a more rational level. In addition, clients are also encouraged to avoid demands in an [[Anti-oppressive practice|anti-oppressive]] order to avoid anger.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Potts, L.|year=2008|title=Anger management|editor=L. Krueger|location=Farmington Hills, MI|publisher=Greenhaven Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a demand placed on a client may be that, "I have to have this done by my standards". Research is starting to show that the better individuals understand what anger management is and how it can help them personally and in relationships, aggressive actions are less likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freeanger.blogspot.com/|title=Free Anger|publisher=Free Anger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anger treatments' success rates can be difficult to estimate because excessive, severe anger is not a recognized disorder in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''. This manual is used as a reference for mental health professionals. Some research does exist on comparing various treatments for anger, but they also describe methodological difficulties in making accurate comparisons. The best practice for anger treatment is to use multiple techniques than a single technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kassinove, H.|year=2007|contribution=Finding a useful model for the treatment of anger and aggression|editor1=T. A. Cavell|editor2=K. T. Malcolm|title=Anger, Aggression, &amp; Interventions for Interpersonal Violence|pp=77–94|location=Mahwah, NJ|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relaxation approach had the highest success rate as a standalone treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mayne, J. T.|author2=Ambrose, K. T.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Research review on anger in psychotherapy|journal=Psychotherapy in Practice|volume=55|issue=3|pages=353–363|pmid=10321749|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(199903)55:3&lt;353::AID-JCLP7&gt;3.0.CO;2-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the CBT-based anger management therapies has been evaluated by a number of [[meta-analyses]]. In a 1998 meta-analysis with 50 studies and 1640 individuals, measures of anger and aggression were used to compare the effects of the anger management intervention with no treatment. A significant effect for anger management was found with a 67% chance of improvement for individuals having received the anger management as compared to the individuals without the therapy.&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt; In addition, a 2009 meta-analysis compared psychological treatments for anger across 96 studies. After an average of 8 sessions, a significant improvement in anger reduction resulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Saini, M.|year=2009|title=A meta-analysis of the psychological treatment of anger: Developing guidelines for evidence-based practice|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|volume=37|issue=4|pp=473–488|pmid=20018996|url=http://jaapl.org/content/37/4/473.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the completion of an anger management program is likely to result in long-lasting positive changes in behavior. Successful interventions can result in not only a reduction of the outward display of [[aggression]], but also a decrease in the internal level of anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=DiGiuseppe, R.|author2=Tafrate, R. C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|title=Anger Treatment for Adults: A Meta-Analytic Review. Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice|volume=10|issue=1|pp=70–84|doi= 10.1093/clipsy.10.1.70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medication ===
As anger is a psychological concern, treating with medication is a secondary line of approach. However, if there is a medical reason for an anger response certain psychotropic medications are prescribed by doctors to complement the psychotherapy intervention. Medications include Antidepressants, Anti-psychotics, Anti-seizure and Beta blockers. These drugs specifically do not target anger directly, but they have a calming outcome that can support control of rage and negative feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles H. Elliott|author2=Laura L. Smith|author3=W. Doyle Gentry|title=Anger Management For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idplCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA289|year=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-03000-3|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antidepressants may have a particular role when anger is a manifestation of depression. Anger attacks are found in 40% of those with [[major depressive disorder]] with 64–71% of cases responding to an [[SSRI]] such as [[fluoxetine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fava et al |first1=M |title=Fluoxetine treatment of anger attacks: a replication study |journal=Annals of Clinical Psychiatry |date=1996 |volume=8 |page=7-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Valerian (herb)|Valerian]] roots and [[saffron]] threads are herbal supplements that supposedly help in lowering stress and promotes calm feelings. Passionflower and chamomile are generally consumed in tea for supporting mood by reducing anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title= Anger management by medication | url= http://www.worldofchemicals.com/596/chemistry-articles/vital-role-of-chemistry-behind-anger.html  | publisher=''[[WorldOfChemicals]]''| date=Oct 17, 2017 |accessdate=October  20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affected populations==

===Adults===
One motivation for seeking anger management can be career related. As both a preventative and corrective tool, anger management is available to help individuals [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with potentially anger-inducing aspects of their jobs. One such situation applies to caretakers of individuals with [[mental illness]]. The daily stress combined with slow or no progress with the people under their care can create a high level of frustration. Skills training for caretakers of relatives with dementia has been developed to help cope with these feelings of frustration in a positive manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Coon, D.|author2=Thompson, L.|author3=Steffen, A.|author4=Sorocco, K.|author5=Gallagher-Thompson, D.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|title=Anger and depression management: Psychoeducational skill training interventions for women caregivers of a relative with dementia|journal=Gerontologist|volume=43|issue=5|pp= 678–689|pmid=14570964|url=http://gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/5/678.long|doi=10.1093/geront/43.5.678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anger management is also beneficial in [[law enforcement]]. The role of police officers is to protect civilians, however, conflicts between the police and the general public can develop. The goal of anger management would be to reduce such occurrences like police brutality from negatively impacting the relationship between law enforcement and citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Abernethy, A. D.|author2=Cox, C.|year=1994|lastauthoramp=y|title=Anger management training for law enforcement personnel|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|volume=22|issue=5|pp=459–466|doi=10.1016/0047-2352(94)90036-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anger management programs tailored towards this goal could orient themselves towards these means by focusing on [[conflict resolution]] and including specific law enforcement scenarios in the training. This need was noticed by Novaco, who originally designed an intervention for anger management based on cognitive behavioral therapy, resulting in a specialized skills training program for law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Novaco, R.|year=1977|title= Stress inoculation approach to anger management in training of law-enforcement officers|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|volume=5|issue=3|pp=327–346|pmid=910754|doi=10.1007/BF00884700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Couples also in the brink of dissolution of their marriage need to understand what to do about [[intimate partner violence]], and the more knowledgeable the individuals are on how to manage their anger, the better prepared they are when confronted with a problem with another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Shorey, R. C.|author2=Seavey, A. E.|author3=Quinn, E.|author4=Cornelius, T.

===Children and adolescents===
The ability for young children to understand their emotions and how to react in certain situations can greatly increase their chance of expressing themselves in an appropriate manner.  A 2010 study from the ''Journal of Applied School Psychology'' looked at four 4th grade boys who took part in different activities with the [[school psychologist]], ranging from how to deal with emotions to practicing anger reduction strategies. They found a positive correlation between partaking in these meetings and less anger expressing in a multitude of locations (school, home, etc.).&lt;ref name="Sportsman"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sportsman, E. L.|author2=Carlson, J. S.|author3=Guthrie, K. M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2010|title=Lesson learned from leading an anger management group using the "seeing red" curriculum within an elementary school|journal=Journal of Applied School Psychology|volume=26|issue=4|pp=339–350|doi=10.1080/15377903.2010.518823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anger management programs with a cognitive-behavioral basis have been modified for children and adolescents. There are three common types of CBT aimed at the youth. First, [[life skills]] development (communication, empathy, assertiveness, etc.) uses modeling to teach appropriate reactions to anger. Second, effective education focuses on identifying the feelings of anger and relaxation. Finally, problem solving conveys a view of cause and effect for situations as an alternative to anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=P.C Kendall|title=Cognitive-behavioral therapies with youth: Guiding theory, current status, and emerging developments|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=61|issue=2|year=1993|pp=235–247|pmid=8473577|doi=10.1037/0022-006X.61.2.235}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of methods can be used to convey these three components, with both age and severity being important factors. For younger children, involvement can be increased by presenting anger management in more of a fun format with educational games and activities being available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Plummer, D. M.|year=2008|title=Anger management games for children|location=London, GBR|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; For adolescents, group therapy can be an effective form given the resemblance to the individual's natural social environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Snyder, K. v.|author2=Kymissis, P.|author3=Kessler, K.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1999|title=Anger management for adolescents: Efficacy of brief group therapy|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=38|issue=11|pp= 1409–1416|pmid=10560228|doi=10.1097/00004583-199911000-00016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The severity of expressed anger issues often relates to the intensity of the subsequent anger management program. A few violent outbursts in a classroom setting could result in several sessions with the school's counselor. However, more severe [[juvenile delinquency]] could result in court-mandated anger management sessions in a juvenile correctional facility.

The effectiveness of anger management has been studied in children and adolescents for the purpose of evaluating existing programs and designing more effective programs. In a meta-analyses of 40 studies, an overall effect size of 0.67 was found for CBT anger management treatment, suggesting anger management as a legitimate approach to problematic levels of anger. Skills development (0.79) and problem solving (0.67) both had a higher impact than affective education (0.36). This was believed to be due to behavioral aspects being more easily conveyed than cognitive for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sukhodolsky, D.|author2=Kassinove, H.|author3=Gorman, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2004|title=Cognitive-behavioral therapy for anger in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|volume= 9|issue=3|pp=247–269|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2003.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The true value from early interventions aimed at youths comes from the preventative aspect. Curbing negative behaviors early in life could lead to a more positive outlook as an adult.&lt;ref name=Candelaria&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Candelaria, A. M.|author2=Fedewa, A. L.|author3=Ahn, S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=The effects of anger management on children's social and emotional outcomes: A meta-analysis|journal=School Psychology International|volume=33|issue=6|pp=596–614|doi=10.1177/0143034312454360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individuals with intellectual disabilities===
{{Main|Intellectual disabilities}}
Individuals with intellectual disabilities can struggle with managing anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kiely, J.|author2=Pankhurst, H.|title=Violence faced by staff in a learning disability service|journal=Disability and Rehabilitation|volume=20|issue=3|pp=81–89|year=1998|pmid=9548019|doi=10.3109/09638289809166060}}&lt;/ref&gt; When faced with aggression from individuals with an intellectual disability, caretakers often employ a combination of four different strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Taylor, J.|year=2002|title=A review of the assessment and treatment of anger and aggression in offenders with intellectual disability|journal=Journal of Intellectual Disability Research|volume=46|pp= 57–73|pmid=12031019|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2788.2002.00005.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on both the setting and individual, the following strategies for aggression minimization present in different ways.

# '''Reactive strategies''' – Aim to minimize impact of overtly aggressive behavior by using established protocols. Ex. Enforced isolation after the start of a violent outburst.
# '''Ecological interventions''' – Attempt to reduce aggression level by changing an aspect of the environment for a more calming effect. Ex. Reducing ambient noise to lower irritation.
# '''Contingency management''' – Focuses on modifying behavior through a combination of reinforcement and punishment. Ex. Using a token economy to enforce rules concerning behavior.
# '''Positive programming''' – Teaches positive reaction skills as an alternative to aggression. Ex. Anger management with a CBT background.

The need for anger management is also evident in situations where individuals with intellectual disabilities are prescribed psychotropic medication as the result of aggressive or self-injurious behavior. The medication's role as a chemical restraint does not help modify the underlying cause of aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Matson J. L.|author2=Bamburg J. W.|author3=Mayville E.

This is a group that a majority of the population might not associate with having AM problems, but research shows over half of the population of Americans with intellectual disabilities displays violent and aggressive actions somewhat regularly.  People with a [[learning disability]] tend to express anger and aggression to even those who help them on a daily basis.  Adults with intellectual disabilities are at high risk of acting aggressive and being sent to clinics due to their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Willner, P.|author2=Jahoda, A.|author3=Larkin, P.|year=2013|chapter=Management of anger in people with intellectual disabilities|editor=E.

The "[[theory of the mind]]" approach states that people with anger management problems tend to be unsteady mentally and are not able to internalize any blame for their actions. One of the main reasons for anger outbursts is externalizing blame and having a quick impulse to lash out.  These individuals need to have a better understanding of what their actions mean and that they should understand that blaming themselves for problems can sometimes be the right thing to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Josephs, L.|author2=McLeod, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2014|title=A theory of mind–focused approach to anger management|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology|volume=31|issue=1|pp=68–83|doi=10.1037/a0034175|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263922830_A_theory_of_mind-focused_approach_to_anger_management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violent criminals ===
{{Main|Violence}}
One study found that offenders who were currently in high-security hospitals that went through a self-report 20 class training program actually had very positive results.  Results of the self-report showed a decrease in aggression and a lack of responding when angry.  There were two issues to keep in mind though; a hospital setting and a setting in which the researchers did not want to provoke much anger due to the instability of the patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wilson, C.|author2=Gandolfi, S.|author3=Dudley, A.|author4=Thomas, B.|author5=Tapp, J.|author6=Moore, E. |lastauthoramp=y|year=2013|title=Evaluation of anger management groups in a high‐security hospital|journal=Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health|volume=23|issue=5|pp=356–371|doi=10.1002/cbm.1873|pmid=23881899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one meta-analysis study composed of studies completed from 1979 to 2010, school-aged children who were identified as having aggressive personalities were given several different anger management classes.  Overall, results showed slightly positive results for children receiving the classes (less aggression).  The courses aimed at reducing negative emotions in the children and trying to help them with [[self-control]].  While no overarching conclusions could be made, researchers state that children going through anger management courses are more prepared to combat their anger internally and less likely to act out.&lt;ref name=Candelaria/&gt;

=== Substance abusers ===
{{Main| Substance abuse}}
There is no statistical information that shows people who substance abuse also have high rates of aggressive actions.  However, researchers believe this is a group of people that should be studied due to their questionable decision-making and typically unstable mental health. Substance abusers could benefit from anger management to prevent potential aggression.

=== Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) individuals ===
{{Main|Posttraumatic stress disorder}}
This group can benefit from extended CBT dealing with anger management issues.  One study dealing with n= 86 war veterans found that during the 12 sessions of training, anger traits slightly dropped as well as small reductions in expressing anger. Research also indicates that their antisocial personality traits upon return can put them behind in society, so finding the right anger management courses is of vital importance.  There were not significant enough findings from this study to definitely recommend veterans with PTSD to use CBT anger management courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Marshall, A.

=== People with traumatic brain injuries ===
{{Main|Traumatic brain injury}}
People with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) can display impulsive, aggressive and dangerous actions.  A study in the ''[[Brain Injury (journal)|Brain Injury]]'' showed that one way to prevent such actions is a community-based treatment of people with TBI.  Results indicated that the need to lash out diminished after the 12-week program, and a series of post-treatment testing showed a decline in self-reported frequency of angry actions. Other specific results included: significant decreases in the frequency of experiencing angry feelings and the frequency of outward expression of anger as well as significant increases in the frequency of controlling feelings of anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Walker, A.

== Associated people ==

=== Seneca ===
{{Main|Seneca the Younger}}
One of the first people to study anger and the control of anger was the Roman philosopher Seneca.  He studied anger during his lifetime, c. 4 BC – AD 65, and from his experiences and observations he formulated ways to control anger.  This could be considered an early form of anger management. Seneca noted the importance of how to avoid becoming angry, how to quit being angry, and how to deal with anger in other people.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

Another theorist who came after Seneca was Galen, a Roman era philosopher, who built on the work of Seneca to formulate new ideas in the area of anger management.  Galen stresses the importance of a mentor to help deal with excess anger.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Peter Stearns ===
{{Main|Peter Stearns}}
Peter Stearns played an important part in researching the differences in anger between genders. Stearns concluded that there are similarities between male and females experience of anger. June Crawford came up with an opposing idea about how the two genders deal with anger. Her research concluded that men and women deal with anger by different means.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Raymond Novaco ===
Works from Raymond Novaco in the 1970s have contributed to many of the recent ideas on the management of anger. These ideas have led to the implementation of different anger management programs. Novaco stressed the importance of looking at the situations that led up to the anger in order to have control over the anger. He stated that anger is an emotional response to situations, and that anger occurs in three modalities, either cognitive, somaticaffective or behavioral.  After discovering the anger, there should be discussion and self-examination in order to relieve the anger. This process was thought to help the client identify the situations that lead to anger and deal with the anger depending on the step that the anger is occurring in. The client is able to use different relaxation skills to reduce their anger before it advances.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Benefits==
The benefits of undergoing anger management brings around the successful reduction in anger and violent outbursts. Personal relationships that have been previously strained by a high level of aggression may undergo improvement. Professionally, workplace relationships have a similar outcome that are beneficial to an individual's career and personal sense of satisfaction. Legally, continued attendance to anger management programs, mandated or not, can be seen as a sign of good faith. For incarcerated individuals, an earlier parole time can be the result of good behavior learned from anger management classes. From an emotional standpoint, reducing the internal level of anger results in a decrease in stress and an increase in overall happiness as a result.

From a medical standpoint, physical illnesses also improve from positive emotional and behavioral changes. Anger management style and overall level of anger has been associated with both acute and chronic pain sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Burns, J.|author2=Bruehl, S.|author3=Caceres, C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2004|title=Anger management style, blood pressure reactivity, and acute pain sensitivity: Evidence for "trait X situation" models|journal=Annals of Behavioral Medicine|volume=27|issue=3|pp=195–204|pmid=15184095|doi=10.1207/s15324796abm2703_7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blood pressure]] is another physiological aspect effected by anger, with increased levels of anger being correlated with higher blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Faber, S.|author2=Burns, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1996|title=Anger management style, degree of expressed anger, and gender influence cardiovascular recovery from interpersonal harassment|journal=Journal of Behavioral Medicine|volume=19|issue=1|pp=31–53|pmid=8932660|doi=10.1007/BF01858173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of an effect on blood pressure for overall health is made evident by the link between high blood pressure and the increased risk of [[cardiovascular disease]]. An increase in the immune system's efficacy has also been observed as a result of the increased level of relaxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Weber, C.|author2=Arck, P.|author3=Mazurek, B.|author4=Klapp, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|title=Impact of a relaxation training on psychometric and immunologic parameters in tinnitus sufferers|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|volume=52|issue=1|pp=29–33|pmid=11801262|doi=10.1016/S0022-3999(01)00281-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful anger management could also lead to an overall longer life span due to the decrease in reckless behavior and violent altercations.

==Impediments==
There are a number of factors that can lower the probability of a successful anger management intervention. One such obstacle is the level of the individual's [[motivation]]. Overall low readiness is an impediment to the effectiveness of anger management due to the lower attendance rates and negative effect on the [[therapeutic alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Howells, K.|author2=Day, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|title=Readiness for anger management: Clinical and theoretical issues|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=23|issue=2|pp=319–337|pmid=12573674|doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(02)00228-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Involuntary assignment to an anger management program, for example court mandated sessions, will result in a lower average motivation level than voluntary admission. In one study with incarcerated inmates, there was a correlation found between individual readiness and improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heseltine, K.|year=2010|title=Brief anger interventions with offenders may be ineffective: A replication and extension|type=report|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|volume=48|issue=3|p=246|pmid=19896643|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2009.10.005|url=http://www.hsjcc.on.ca/Resource%20Library/Forensic%20Clinical/Brief%20anger%20interventions%20with%20offenders%20may%20be%20ineffective%20-%202010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, given the component of anger as a [[social construct]], difficulty with communication between cultures can serve as another impediment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.R. Averill|year=1993|contribution=Putting the social in social cognition, with special reference to emotion|editor1=R.S. Wyer|editor2=T.K. Srull|title=Perspectives on anger and emotion: advances in social cognition|volume=VI|pp=47–56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2aYAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|isbn=9780805813272|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is deemed an appropriate expression of anger is culturally dependent. Therefore, a mismatch between client and therapist could result in a misunderstanding as to the end goal of the program. For example, a client could only wish to decrease physical violence, while the therapist aims to decrease both verbal and physical outbursts. Gender-dependent expectations of anger expression can contribute as well to societal standards. The same [[Violence|violent]] outburst for a man and woman is subject to different interpretations due to anger being seen as more permissible in males.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

The cost of taking anger management could also be a significant obstacle if the person does not have health insurance.  The time required for anger management depends on the program. Weekly one-hour sessions with eight to 12 sessions per program are common, but a single intensive all-day session variety exists as well. The monetary cost can amount to $90–$120 per session for general therapy, or much higher fees for specialized coaching. The availability of anger management programs locally can be problematic for more isolated areas, creating an additional cost for travel. However, online options can follow the same structure as an in-person intervention with similar outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Morland, L. A.|author2=Greene, C. J.|author3=Rosen, C.

[[File:Bürgerkinder zur Biedermeierzeit (um 1820).jpg|thumb|The ''Bildungsbürger'' class defined itself more on the basis of education than material possessions and thus great emphasis was laid upon the education of the children.]]
'''''Bildungsbürgertum''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbɪldʊŋsˌbʏʁɡɐtuːm|lang}}) is a [[social class]] that initially emerged in mid-18th century [[Germany]] as an educated class of the [[bourgeoisie]] with an educational ideal based on idealistic values and [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/ins/gb/lp/prj/mtg/typ/bil/en4278538.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Bildungsbuergertum]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Bildungsbürgertum'' could be described as the intellectual and economic upper bourgeoisie in contrast to the ''Kleinbürgertum'' ([[petite bourgeoisie]]).

== Term ==
The term itself was coined in the 1920s by the right wing and had an anti-bourgeois sentiment, which was perceived by the incompatible idea of being a 'genuine' intellectual and a bourgeois (Bürger).

The term ''Bildungsbürgertum'' is a concept difficult to translate into the English language. The notion of the word "''[[Bildung]]''" has broader meaning than that of "culture", or "education", and is deeply rooted in the idea of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZIcAAJfYEocC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=Bildungsbürgertum+translate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=beTsrI3Xe8&amp;sig=A4siNZRkSVh9KVg6ftn3VSvGz_Q&amp;hl=fi&amp;ei=52usTuvfHOTm4QTEn5zaDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CHIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Bildungsbürgertum%20translate&amp;f=false] – The future of market transition, Kevin T. Leicht&lt;/ref&gt; The term also corresponds to the ideal of education in the work of [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].  Thus, in this context, the concept of education becomes a lifelong process of human development; rather than mere training in gaining certain external knowledge or skills, education is seen as a process wherein an individual's spiritual and cultural sensibilities as well as life, personal and social skills are in a process of continual expansion and growth. (See ''[[Bildung]]'', [[General knowledge]])

== Formation ==

''Bildungsbürgertum'' was the term for a new social class that initially emerged in Germany in the mid-18th century. This group distinguished themselves through education in the humanities, literature, and science, and involvement in the state affairs.  As a class of wealthy non-noble people, emerging first in the [[free imperial city|free imperial cities]], they gained material wealth, social position and a better education, which was based on Humboldt's educational ideal. The idea of ''[[Bildung]]'' (i.e. culture, education) was shaped by a belief in human perfectibility, specifically that an individual's potential could be realized through a classical education. 

In the late [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] management state there existed a need for a large number of educated officials to implement reforms.  To avoid a violent revolution, as in France, a national class was formed that had access to cultural education and thus to political positions. As a result, many educational institutions were established, significantly more in Germany. The universities established in Germany, including the [[Humboldt University]], became a model for modern universities in other countries. This new class was not primarily defined politically or economically, but mainly culturally. It is often argued that Germany owes its reputation in technical expertise, scholarship and administration to the ''Bildungsbürgertum''.

[[Nationalism]] at its origin was a liberal ideal, and as the ''Bildungsbürgertum'' were often represented in the liberal factions of society, they were often in the forefront of the quest for the founding of a sovereign [[nation state]]. By the 1870s, the bulk of the ''Bildungsbürgertum'' had lost its forward-driving liberal orientation. 

According to professor [[Klaus Vondung]], the following characteristics could be applied to the ''Bildungsbürgertum'' at the end of the 19th century: 

*academic education
*[[Ingroups and outgroups|in-group]] behaviour, self-isolation from other social classes and establishment of neo-aristocratic thinking, especially concerning stature and pedigree.
*high self-recruitment
*social prestige being perceived as more important than material wealth
*predominantly Protestant
*considered the "cultural elite"
*dominated certain professions

In the 18th century, academic occupations such as professors, [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (grammar school) teachers, physicians, pharmacists, attorneys, judges, Protestant ministers, engineers and leading officials were strongly represented among the ''Bildungsbürger''. 

In Germany the ''Bildungsbürgertum'' exercised first influence before the bourgeoisie as the commercial class gained more influence during industrialization from 1850 onwards. In France and Britain, it developed mainly as a commercial class and could, by virtue of its economic strength, claim political power. In Germany the formation of the bourgeoisie occurred only in the first half of the 1800s, to be politically active. It played a crucial role in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolution of 1848]], which nevertheless failed.

Well-known examples of individuals associated with the term ''Bildungsbürgertum'' are the 20th-century writer [[Thomas Mann]] or the [[Weizsäcker family]].

'''COBIT''' ('''Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies''') is a good-practice [[Software framework|framework]] created by international professional association [[ISACA]] for [[Information technology management|information technology (IT) management]] and [[Corporate governance of information technology|IT governance]]. COBIT provides an implementable "set of controls over information technology and organizes them around a logical framework of IT-related processes and enablers."&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zNgRBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 |chapter=Chapter 5: COBIT as a Framework for Enterprise Governance of IT |title=Enterprise Governance of Information Technology: Achieving Alignment and Value, Featuring COBIT 5 |author1=Haes, S.D. |author2=Grembergen, W.V. |publisher=Springer |edition=2nd |year=2015 |pages=103–128 |isbn=9783319145471 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ISACA first released COBIT in 1996, originally as a set of control objectives{{clarify|date=June 2018}} to help the financial audit community better maneuver in IT-related environments.&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="StroudIntro12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaca.org/education/upcoming-events/documents/intro-cobit5.pdf |format=PDF |title=Introduction to COBIT 5 |author=Stroud, R.E. |publisher=ISACA |date=2012 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing value in expanding the framework beyond just the auditing realm, ISACA released a broader version 2 in 1998 and expanded it even further by adding management guidelines in 2000's version 3. The development of both the [[AS 8015]]: ''Australian Standard for Corporate Governance of Information and Communication Technology'' in January 2005&lt;ref name="Cruz10AS8015_06"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtREBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95 |chapter=10: AS 8015-2005 - Australian Standard for Corporate Governance of ICT |title=Frameworks for IT Management |author=da Cruz, M. |editor1=van Bon, J. |editor2=Verheijen, T. |publisher=Van Haren Publishing |year=2006 |pages=95–102 |isbn=9789077212905 |accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the more international draft standard ISO/IEC DIS 29382 (which soon after became [[ISO/IEC 38500]]) in January 2007&lt;ref name="ISODIS29382Arch"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?&amp;item_s_key=00490704 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623191716/https://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?&amp;item_s_key=00490704 |title=ISO/IEC DIS 29382: 2007 Edition, February 1, 2007 |work=IHS Standards Store |publisher=IHS, Inc |archivedate=23 June 2016 |accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased awareness of the need for more information and communication technology (ICT) governance components. ISACA inevitably added related components/frameworks with versions 4 and 4.1 in 2005 and 2007 respectively, "addressing the IT-related business processes and responsibilities in value creation ([[Val IT]]) and risk management ([[Risk IT]])."&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="StroudIntro12" /&gt;

In April 2012, COBIT 5 was released. Several drivers were responsible for the transition from 4.1 to 5:&lt;ref name="ProtivitiISACA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protivit.us/en-UK/Documents/Insights/IT-Flash-Report-COBIT5.PDF |format=PDF |title=ISACA Releases COBIT 5: Updated Framework for the Governance and Management of IT |publisher=Provitivi, Inc |date=18 May 2012 |accessdate=23 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{prose|section|date=June 2018}}
* need for a more coherent understanding of how existing standards, best practices, and other tools relate and augment each other;
* need for a more end-to-end business/organization scope that covers all business and IT functions;
* need for improved guidance on hot-topic items such as [[enterprise architecture]] and emerging technologies;
* need for tighter integration among COBIT and other ISACA research, recommendations, and frameworks;
* need for tighter integration with external standards, recommendations, and frameworks; and
* need for improved information organization and dissemination concerning the framework.

An add-on for COBIT 5 related to information security was released in December 2012, and one related to assurance was released in June 2013.&lt;ref name="C5InfoSec"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/Information-Security-Product-Page.aspx |title=COBIT 5 for Information Security |publisher=ISACA |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C5Assur"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/Assurance-product-page.aspx |title=COBIT 5 for Assurance |publisher=ISACA |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November and December of 2018, the next version of COBIT, COBIT 2019, was released.

==The COBIT framework==
COBIT was initially "Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies," though before the release of the framework people talked of "CobiT" as "Control Objectives for IT"&lt;ref name="KatsikasInfo96"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_pLAAAAYAAJ |title=Information Systems Security: Facing the Information Society of the 21st Century |series=IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology |editor1=Katsikas, S. |editor2=Gritzalis, D. |publisher=Springer |page=358 |year=1996 |isbn=9780412781209 |quote=The [[McCumber cube|McCumber model]] has great similarities with the CobiT - Control Objectives for IT - framework (CobiT 1995).}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology."&lt;ref name="ISACAFirstArch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaca.org/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961107101619/http://www.isaca.org/ |title=Welcome to the ISACA/F |publisher=ISACA |date=18 October 1996 |archivedate=7 November 1996 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework defines a set of generic processes for the management of IT, with each process defined together with process inputs and outputs, key process-activities, process objectives, performance measures and an elementary [[Capability Maturity Model|maturity model]]. COBIT also provides a set of recommended best practices for governance and control process of information systems and technology with the essence of aligning IT with business. COBIT 5 consolidates COBIT 4.1, Val IT and Risk IT into a single framework acting as an enterprise framework aligned and interoperable with other frameworks and standards.&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15" /&gt;

===Framework and components===
The business orientation of COBIT consists of linking business goals to IT goals, providing metrics and maturity models to measure their achievement, and identifying the associated responsibilities of business and IT process owners.

The process focus of COBIT is illustrated by a process model that subdivides IT into four domains (Plan and Organize; Acquire and Implement; Deliver and Support; and Monitor and Evaluate) and 34 processes inline with the responsibility areas of plan, build, run, and monitor. It is positioned at a high level and has been aligned and harmonized with other, more detailed IT standards and good practices such as [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission|COSO]], [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library|ITIL]], [[Business Information Services Library|BiSL]], [[ISO 27000]], [[Capability Maturity Model Integration|CMMI]], [[TOGAF]] and [[PMBOK]]. COBIT acts as an integrator of these different guidance materials, summarizing key objectives under one umbrella framework that link the good practice models with governance and business requirements.&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15" /&gt; COBIT 5 further consolidated and integrated the COBIT 4.1, Val IT 2.0 and Risk IT frameworks and drew from ISACA's ''IT Assurance Framework'' (ITAF) and the ''Business Model for Information Security'' (BMIS).

The framework and its components can, when utilized well, also contribute to ensuring regulatory compliance. It can encourage less wasteful information management, improve retention schedules, increase business agility, and lower costs while better complying with data retention and management regulations.&lt;ref name="LuelligACOBIT13"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.isaca.org/Journal/archives/2013/Volume-5/Pages/A-COBIT-Approach-to-Regulatory-Compliance-and-Defensible-Disposal.aspx |title=A COBIT Approach to Regulatory Compliance and Defensible Disposal |journal=ISACA Journal |author1=Luellig, L. |author2=Frazier, J. |volume=5 |year=2013 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COBIT components include:
* Framework: Organizes IT governance objectives and good practices by IT domains and processes and links them to business requirements.
* Process descriptions: A reference process model and common language for everyone in an organization. The processes map to responsibility areas of plan, build, run, and monitor.
* Control objectives: Provides a complete set of high-level requirements to be considered by management for effective control of each IT process.
* Management guidelines: Helps assign responsibility, agree on objectives, measure performance, and illustrate interrelationship with other processes.
* Maturity models: Assesses maturity and capability per process and helps to address gaps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2935">The '''Cebeci–Smith model''' is a 0-equation [[eddy viscosity]] model used in [[computational fluid dynamics]] analysis of [[turbulence|turbulent]] [[boundary layer]] flows. The model gives eddy viscosity, &lt;math&gt;\mu_t&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of the local boundary layer velocity profile. The model is suitable for high-speed flows with thin attached boundary-layers, typically present in aerospace applications.  Like the [[Baldwin-Lomax model]], this model is not suitable for cases with large [[flow separation|separated]] regions and significant curvature/rotation effects.  Unlike the [[Baldwin-Lomax model]], this model requires the determination of a boundary layer edge.

The model was developed by [[Tuncer Cebeci]] and [[Apollo M. O. Smith]], in 1967.

== Equations ==

In a two-layer model, the boundary layer is considered to comprise two layers: inner (close to the surface) and outer. The eddy viscosity is calculated separately for each layer and combined using:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mu_t =
\begin{cases}
{\mu_t}_\text{inner} &amp; \mbox{if } y \le y_\text{crossover} \\ 
{\mu_t}_\text{outer} &amp; \mbox{if } y &gt; y_\text{crossover}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;y_\text{crossover}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest distance from the surface where &lt;math&gt;{\mu_t}_\text{inner}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;{\mu_t}_\text{outer}&lt;/math&gt;.

The inner-region eddy viscosity is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mu_t}_\text{inner} = \rho \ell^2 \left[\left(
 \frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\right)^2 +
 \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\right)^2
\right]^{1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\ell = \kappa y \left( 1 - e^{-y^+/A^+} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

with the von Karman constant &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; usually being taken as 0.4, and with

:&lt;math&gt;
A^+ = 26\left[1+y\frac{dP/dx}{\rho u_\tau^2}\right]^{-1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The eddy viscosity in the outer region is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mu_t}_\text{outer} = \alpha \rho U_e \delta_v^* F_K
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0.0168&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta_v^*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[displacement thickness]], given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_v^* = \int_0^\delta \left(1 - \frac{U}{U_e}\right)\,dy
&lt;/math&gt;

and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; is the Klebanoff intermittency function given by

:&lt;math&gt;
F_K = \left[1 + 5.5 \left( \frac{y}{\delta} \right)^6
  \right]^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1950s, the term has become widely{{quantify|date=July 2017}} used, with varying meanings, in religion, the [[Social science|social sciences]], the [[biological sciences]], the media, and throughout Western societies.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Since the advent of [[Dungeons_%26_Dragons|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] in 1974, the word charisma has also been used as an attribute in gaming, where it designates a character's likeability and their ability to persuade.

==Etymology==
The English term ''charisma'' is from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|χάρισμα}} (''khárisma''), which means "favor freely given" or "gift of grace".&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) 266–283. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt; The term and its plural {{lang|grc|χαρίσματα}} (''charismata'') derive from {{lang|grc|χάρις}} (''charis''), which means "grace". Some derivatives from that root (including "grace") have similar meanings to the modern sense of ''personality charisma'', such as "filled with attractiveness or charm", "kindness", "to bestow a favor or service", or "to be favored or blessed".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;"charisma" in ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' second edition. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beekes, Robert. ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek''. Brill, 2010, p. 1607.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Koine Greek|ancient Greek dialect]] widely used in [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]] employed these terms without the connotations found in modern religious usage.&lt;ref name=Ebertz&gt;Ebertz, Michael N. "Charisma" in ''Religion Past &amp; Present.'' edited by Hans Dieter Betz, et al., Brill, 2007, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek]]s applied personality charisma to their [[Greek mythology|gods]]; for example, attributing charm, beauty, nature, human creativity or fertility to goddesses they called ''[[Charites]]'' ({{lang|grc|Χάριτες}}).

Theologians and social scientists have expanded and modified the original Greek meaning into the two distinct senses above. For ease of reference, we will call the first sense ''personality charisma'' and the second ''divinely conferred charisma''.

The meaning of ''charisma'' has become greatly diffused from its original ''divinely conferred'' meaning, and even from the ''personality charisma'' meaning in modern English dictionaries, which reduces to a mixture of charm and status. John Potts, who has extensively analyzed the term's history, sums up meanings beneath this diffused common usage:&lt;blockquote&gt;Contemporary charisma maintains, however, the irreducible character ascribed to it by Weber: it retains a mysterious, elusive quality. Media commentators regularly describe charisma as the "X-factor". …The enigmatic character of charisma also suggests a connection – at least to some degree – to the earliest manifestations of charisma as a spiritual gift.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, John. A History of Charisma. Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Divinely conferred charisma===
The [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Bible|Christian Bible]] record the development of ''divinely conferred charisma''. In the Hebrew text the idea of charismatic leadership is generally signaled by the use of the noun ''hen'' (favor) or the verb ''hanan'' (to show favor). The Greek term for ''charisma'' (grace or favor), and its root ''charis'' (grace) replaced the Hebrew terms in the Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (the 3rd century BC [[Koine Greek#Biblical Koine|Septuagint]]). Throughout, "the paradigmatic image of the charismatic hero is the figure who has received God's favor".&lt;ref name = Scheper&gt;Scheper, George L. "Charisma" in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' edited by Lindsay Jones. Macmillan Reference USA, 2005, v 3, p. 1545.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ''divinely conferred charisma''&lt;ref&gt;Grabo, A., Spisak, B. R., &amp; van Vugt, M. (2017). Charisma as signal: An evolutionary perspective on charismatic leadership. The Leadership Quarterly, 28(4), 473-485. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.&lt;/ref&gt; applied to highly revered figures.

Thus, Eastern Mediterranean Jews in the 1st century CE had notions of ''charis'' and ''charisma'' that embraced the range of meanings found in Greek culture and the spiritual meanings from the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, John. ''A History of Charisma''. PalgraveMacMillan, 2009, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; From this linguistic legacy of fused cultures, in [[1 Corinthians]], [[Paul the Apostle]] introduced the meaning that the Holy Spirit bestowed ''charism'' and ''charismata'', "the gift of God's grace", upon individuals or groups. For Paul, "[t]here is a clear distinction between charisma and charis; charisma is the direct result of divine charis or grace".&lt;ref&gt;Potts, 2009, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheper, 2005, p. 1549&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Testament]] [[Epistle]]s, Paul refers to ''charisma'' or its plural ''charismata'' seven times in [[1 Corinthians]], written in [[Koine Greek|Koine]] (or common) Greek around 54 CE. He elaborates on his concepts with six references in Romans (c. 56). He makes 3 individual references in [[2 Corinthians]] (c. 56), [[1 Timothy]], and [[2 Timothy]] (c. 62 – c. 67). The seventeenth and only other mention of ''charisma'' is in 1 Peter.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3), pp. 268-269. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ebertz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potts, 2009, pp. 23, 37, 43, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia''. Thomson/Gale, 2003, v. 3, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gospel]]s, written in the late first century, apply ''divinely conferred charisma'' to revered figures. Examples are accounts of [[Jesus|Jesus']] [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]] and of his [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]], in which disciples see him as radiant with light, appearing together with Moses and Elijah. Another example is [[Gabriel|Gabriel's]] greeting to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] as "full of grace".&lt;ref  name=Scheper/&gt; In these and other instances [[early Christians]] designated certain individuals as possessing "spiritual gifts", and these gifts included "the ability to penetrate the neighbour to the bottom of his heart and spirit and to recognize whether he is dominated by a good or by an evil spirit and the gift to help him to freedom from his demon".&lt;ref name=Benz&gt;Benz, Ernst Wilhelm. "The Roles of Christianity" in ''The new Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 16, 1986, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Believers characterized their revered religious figures as having "a higher perfection… a special ''Charisma''".&lt;ref name=Benz/&gt; Then, with the establishment of the [[Christian Church]], "the old charismatic gifts and free offerings were transformed into a hierarchical sacerdotal system".&lt;ref&gt;Troeltsch, Ernst. ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches'', translated by Olive Wyon. Allen and Unwin, v. 1, 1911/1931, pp. 99, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on the institution rather than divinely inspired individuals increasingly dominated religious thought and life, and that focus went unchanged for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, William and Mary Morse. ''Harper's Dictionary of Contemporary Usage''. Harper and Row, 1985, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional changes began in the 17th century when church leaders, notably in the [[Western Christianity|Latin tradition]], accented "individual gifts [and] particular talents imparted by [[God in Christianity|God]] or the [[Holy Spirit]]". The 19th century brought an increasing shift in emphasis toward individual and spiritual aspects of charisma; [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and some [[Catholic]] [[Theology|theologians]] narrowed the concept to superlative, out-of-the-ordinary, and virtuoso gifts. Simultaneously, the term became alienated from the much wider meaning that [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] had attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;Ebertz, 2007, pp. 493–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the narrowed term projected back to the earlier period "A systematically reflected and highly differentiated understanding of charisma was often unconsciously infused into the Scriptures and writings of the church fathers, so that these texts were no longer read through the eyes of the authors".&lt;ref&gt;Baumert, N. "'Charisma' – Versuch einer Sprachregelung." ''ThPh'' 66, 1991, p. 22. Quoted in Ebertz, 2007, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt;

These dialectic meanings influenced notable changes in [[Pentecostalism]] in the late 19th century, and [[charismatic movements]] in some mainline churches in the mid-20th century. The discussion in the [[#21st century religion|21st Century Religion]] section explores what ''charisma'' means in these and other religious groups.

===Personality charisma===
The basis for modern secular usage comes from [[Germans|German]] [[sociologist]] [[Max Weber]]. He discovered the term in the work of [[Rudolph Sohm]], a [[Germans|German]] [[church historian]] whose 1892 ''Kirchenrecht''&lt;ref&gt;Sohm, Rudolf. ''Kirchenrecht''. Leipzig: Duncher &amp; Humblot, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; was immediately recognized in Germany as an epoch-making work.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) 269-270. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt; It also stimulated a debate between Sohm and leading theologians and religion scholars, which lasted more than twenty years and stimulated a rich polemical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, David Norman. "Faith, Reason, and Charisma: Rudolf Sohm, Max Weber, and the Theology of Grace," ''Sociological Inquiry'', 68:1 pp. 32–60, 1998, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate and literature had made ''charisma'' a popular term when Weber used it in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and in his [[Sociology of Religion (book)|''Sociology of Religion'']]. Perhaps because he assumed that readers already understood the idea, Weber's early writings lacked definition or explanation of the concept.  In the collection of his works, ''Economy and Society'' edited by his wife, he identified the term as a prime example of action he labeled "value-rational," in distinction from and opposition to action he labeled "Instrumentally rational."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|publisher= Bedminster Press|year=1968|pages=24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because he applied meanings for ''charisma'' similar to Sohm, who had affirmed the purely charismatic nature of early Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;Scheper, 2005, p. 1544.&lt;/ref&gt; Weber's ''charisma'' would have coincided with the ''divinely conferred charisma'' sense defined above in Sohm's work.

Weber introduced the ''personality charisma'' sense when he applied ''charisma'' to designate a form of authority. To explain [[charismatic authority]] he developed his classic definition:&lt;blockquote&gt;Charisma is a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities. These as such are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are regarded as of divine origin or as exemplary, and on the basis of them the individual concerned is treated as a leader.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max. ''The Theory of Social and Economic Organization'', translated by A. M. Henderson and Talcott Parsons. Free Press, 1924/1947, pp. 328, 358ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here Weber extends the concept of charisma beyond supernatural to superhuman and even to exceptional powers and qualities. Sociologist Paul Joosse examined Weber's famous definition, and found that:&lt;blockquote&gt;through simple yet profoundly consequential phrases such as “are considered” and “is treated,” charisma becomes a relational, attributable, and at last a properly sociological concept.... For Weber, the locus of power is in the led, who actively (if perhaps unconsciously) invest their leaders with social authority.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) pp.271. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, Weber indicates that it is followers who attribute the individual with powers, emphasizing that "the recognition on the part of those subject to authority" is decisive for the validity of charisma.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max. 1947, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber died in 1920 leaving "disordered, fragmentary manuscripts without even the guidance of a plan or table of the proposed contents". One unfinished manuscript contained his above quoted definition of ''charisma''.&lt;ref name=MacRae&gt;MacRae, Donald G. ''Max Weber''. Viking, 1974, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; It took over a quarter century for his work to be translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;"Max Weber" in ''Dictionary of the Social Sciences'', edited by Craig Calhoun. Oxford University Press. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to charisma, Weber's formulations are generally regarded as having revived the concept from its deep theological obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Stephen. "Charisma Reconsidered," pp. 5–26 in ''Journal of Classical Sociology'', 3:5, 2003, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even with the admirable translations and prefaces of his entire works, many scholars have found Weber's formulations ambiguous. For the past half-century they have debated the meaning of many Weberian concepts, including the meaning of ''charisma,'' the role of followers, and the degree of a supernatural component.&lt;ref name=MacRae/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Sonja M. 1984. "The Role of Leadership in the Construction of Reality," pp. 157–178 in ''Leadership Multidisciplinary Perspectives'', edited by Barbara Kellerman. Prentice-Hall, 1984, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford. "Centers, Kings, and Charisma: Reflections on the Symbolics of Power," in ''Culture and Its Creators'' edited by Ben-David J. Clark. University of Chicago Press, pp. 150–171, 1977, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Worsley, Peter. 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rustow, Dankwart A. "The Study of Leadership."

Berghahn Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Although sociologists have been most active in applying Weber's ideas, researchers in management and organizational behavior including [[John Antonakis]] and his colleagues, have reignited interest in charisma with respect to defining the term in unambiguous ways, finding ways to experimentally manipulate charisma, and to estimate the causal effects of charisma on performance outcomes in work and political settings.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacquart, P. &amp; Antonakis, J. 2015.

https://dx.doi.org/10.5465/amj.2012.0831&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, evolutionary psychologists have used [[game theory]] and [[costly signaling theory]] to study the functions of charismatic [[leadership]] in the evolution of human cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Grabo, A., &amp; van Vugt, M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9086">'''Chu spaces''' generalize the notion of [[topological space]] by dropping the requirements that the set of [[open sets]] be closed under [[Union (set theory)|union]] and finite [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]], that the open sets be extensional, and that the membership predicate (of points in open sets) be two-valued. The definition of [[continuous function]] remains unchanged other than having to be worded carefully to continue to make sense after these generalizations.

The name is due to Po-Hsiang Chu, who originally constructed a verification of autonomous categories as a graduate student under the direction of [[michael Barr (mathematician)|Michael Barr]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/papers/chu-hist.pdf ''The Chu Construction: History of an Idea] Michael Barr McGill University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Understood statically, a Chu space (''A'', ''r'', ''X'') over a set ''K'' consists of a set ''A'' of points, a set ''X'' of states, and a function ''r'' : ''A'' &amp;times; ''X'' → ''K''. This makes it an ''A'' &amp;times; ''X'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] with entries drawn from ''K'', or equivalently a ''K''-valued [[binary relation]] between ''A'' and ''X'' (ordinary binary relations being 2-valued).

Understood dynamically, Chu spaces transform in the manner of topological spaces, with ''A'' as the set of points, ''X'' as the set of open sets, and ''r'' as the membership relation between them, where ''K'' is the set of all possible degrees of membership of a point in an open set.  The counterpart of a continuous function from (''A'', ''r'', ''X'') to (''B'', ''s'', ''Y'') is a pair (''f'', ''g'') of functions ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'', ''g'' : ''Y'' → ''X'' satisfying the ''adjointness condition'' ''s''(''f''(''a''), ''y'') = ''r''(''a'', ''g''(''y'')) for all ''a'' ∈ ''A'' and ''y'' ∈ ''Y''.  That is, ''f'' maps points forwards at the same time as ''g'' maps states backwards.  The adjointness condition makes ''g'' the inverse image function ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, while the choice of ''X'' for the [[codomain]] of ''g'' corresponds to the requirement for continuous functions that the inverse image of open sets be open.  Such a pair is called a Chu transform or morphism of Chu spaces.

A topological space (''X'', ''T'') where ''X'' is the set of points and ''T'' the set of open sets, can be understood as a Chu space (''X'',∈,''T'') over {0,&amp;nbsp;1}.  That is, the points of the topological space become those of the Chu space while the open sets become states and the membership relation "&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;" between points and open sets is made explicit in the Chu space. The condition that the set of open sets be closed under arbitrary (including empty) union and finite (including empty) intersection becomes the corresponding condition on the columns of the matrix.  A continuous function ''f'':&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''X''' between two topological spaces becomes an adjoint pair (''f'',''g'') in which ''f'' is now paired with a realization of the continuity condition constructed as an explicit witness function ''g'' exhibiting the requisite open sets in the domain of ''f''.

==Categorical structure==

The category of Chu spaces over ''K'' and their maps is denoted by '''Chu'''('''Set''', ''K'').  As is clear from the symmetry of the definitions, it is a [[self-dual category]]: it is equivalent (in fact isomorphic) to its dual, the category obtained by reversing all the maps.  It is furthermore a [[*-autonomous category]] with dualizing object (''K'', λ, {*}) where λ : ''K'' &amp;times; {*} → ''K'' is defined by λ(''k'', *) = ''k'' (Barr 1979).  As such it is a model of [[Jean-Yves Girard]]'s [[linear logic]] (Girard 1987).

==Variants==

The more general [[enriched category]] '''Chu'''(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''k'') originally appeared in an appendix to Barr (1979).  The Chu space concept originated with [[Michael Barr (mathematician)|Michael Barr]] and the details were developed by his student Po-Hsiang Chu, whose master's thesis formed the appendix.  Ordinary Chu spaces arise as the case ''V'' = '''Set''', that is, when the [[monoidal category]] ''V'' is specialized to the [[cartesian closed category]] '''Set''' of sets and their functions, but were not studied in their own right until more than a decade after the appearance of the more general enriched notion.  A variant of Chu spaces, called [[dialectica space]]s, due to {{harvtxt|de Paiva|1989}} replaces the map condition (1) with the map condition (2):

# ''s''(''f''(''a''), ''y'') = ''r''(''a'', ''g''(''y'')).
# ''s''(''f''(''a''), ''y'') ≤ ''r''(''a'', ''g''(''y'')).

==Universality==

The category '''Top''' of topological spaces and their continuous functions embeds in '''Chu'''('''Set''',&amp;nbsp;2) in the sense that there exists a full and faithful functor ''F'' : '''Top''' → '''Chu'''('''Set''',&amp;nbsp;2) providing for each topological space (''X'', ''T'') its ''representation'' ''F''((''X'', ''T'')) = (''X'', ∈, ''T'') as noted above.  This representation is moreover a ''realization'' in the sense of Pultr and Trnková (1980), namely that the representing Chu space has the same set of points as the represented topological space and transforms in the same way via the same functions.

Chu spaces are remarkable for the wide variety of familiar structures they realize.  Lafont and Streicher (1991) point out that Chu spaces over 2 realize both topological spaces and [[coherent space]]s (introduced by J.-Y. Girard (1987) to model linear logic), while Chu spaces over ''K'' realize any category of vector spaces over a field whose cardinality is at most that of ''K''.  This was extended by [[Vaughan Pratt]] (1995) to the realization of ''k''-ary relational structures by Chu spaces over 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.  For example, the category '''Grp''' of groups and their homomorphisms is realized by '''Chu'''('''Set''',&amp;nbsp;'''8''') since the group multiplication can be organized as a [[triadic relation|ternary relation]].  '''Chu'''('''Set''',&amp;nbsp;2) realizes a wide range of ``logical`` structures such as semilattices, distributive lattices, complete and completely distributive lattices, Boolean algebras, complete atomic Boolean algebras, etc.  Further information on this and other aspects of Chu spaces, including their application to the modeling of concurrent behavior, may be found at ''[http://chu.stanford.edu/ Chu Spaces]''.

==Applications==

===Automata===
Chu spaces can serve as a model of concurrent computation in [[automata theory]] to express branching time and true [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]]. Chu spaces exhibit the quantum mechanical phenomena of complementarity and uncertainty. The complementarity arises as the duality of information and time, automata and schedules, and states and events. Uncertainty arises when a measurement is defined to be a [[morphism]] such that increasing structure in the observed object reduces the clarity of observation. This uncertainty can be calculated numerically from its form factor to yield the usual [[Heisenberg uncertainty]] relation. Chu spaces correspond to [[wavefunctions]] as vectors of [[Hilbert space]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=363682&amp;isnumber=8339&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[topology]], a mathematical discipline, '''combining dimensions''' into a [[manifold]] consists of taking ''n'' dimensions and visualizing them in a smaller ''m'' dimension. Similar concepts apply when studying [[spacetime]] and [[Calabi–Yau manifolds]]. For example, in [[string theory]], six dimensions are combined into a two dimensional manifold for simple visualization.

In [[mathematics]], a [[topological space]] ''X'' is '''contractible''' if the [[identity function|identity map]] on ''X'' is null-homotopic, i.e. if it is [[homotopic]] to some constant map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Munkres | first=James R. | authorlink=James Munkres | title=Topology | edition=2nd | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-13-181629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hatcher | first=Allen | authorlink=Allen Hatcher | title=Algebraic Topology | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2002 | isbn=0-521-79540-0 | url=http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, a contractible space is one that can be continuously shrunk to a point within that space.

A contractible space is precisely one with the [[homotopy type]] of a point. It follows that all the [[homotopy group]]s of a contractible space are [[trivial group|trivial]]. Therefore any space with a nontrivial homotopy group cannot be contractible.  Similarly, since [[singular homology]] is a homotopy invariant, the [[Reduced homology|reduced homology groups]] of a contractible space are all trivial.

For a topological space ''X'' the following are all equivalent:
*''X'' is contractible (i.e. the identity map is null-homotopic).
*''X'' is homotopy equivalent to a one-point space.
*''X'' [[deformation retract]]s onto a point. (However, there exist contractible spaces which do not ''strongly'' deformation retract to a point.)
*For any space ''Y'', any two maps ''f'',''g'': ''Y'' → ''X'' are homotopic.
*For any space ''Y'', any map ''f'': ''Y'' → ''X'' is null-homotopic.

The [[cone (topology)|cone]] on a space ''X'' is always contractible. Therefore any space can be embedded in a contractible one (which also illustrates that subspaces of contractible spaces need not be contractible).

Furthermore, ''X'' is contractible [[if and only if]] there exists a [[Deformation retract|retraction]] from the cone of ''X'' to ''X''.

Every contractible space is [[path connected]] and [[simply connected]]. Moreover, since all the higher homotopy groups vanish, every contractible space is [[n-connected|''n''-connected]] for all ''n'' ≥ 0.

==Locally contractible spaces==
A topological space is '''locally contractible''' if every point has a [[local base]] of contractible [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]]s. Contractible spaces are not necessarily locally contractible nor vice versa. For example, the [[comb space]] is contractible but not locally contractible (if it were, it would be locally connected which it is not). Locally contractible spaces are locally ''n''-connected for all ''n'' ≥ 0. In particular, they are [[locally simply connected]], [[Locally connected space|locally path connected]], and [[locally connected]].

==Examples and counterexamples==
*Any [[Euclidean space]] is contractible, as is any [[star domain]] on a Euclidean space.
*The [[Whitehead manifold]] is contractible.
*[[n-sphere|Spheres]] of any finite dimension are not contractible.
*The [[unit sphere]] in an infinite-dimensional [[Hilbert space]] [[Contractibility of unit sphere in Hilbert space|is contractible]].
*The [[house with two rooms]] is standard example of a space which is contractible, but not intuitively so.
*The [[Dunce hat (topology)|Dunce hat]] is contractible, but not [[Collapse (topology)|collapsible]].
*The cone on a [[Hawaiian earring]] is contractible (since it is a cone), but not locally contractible or even locally simply connected.
*All [[manifold]]s and [[CW complex]]es are ''locally'' contractible, but in general not contractible.
* The [[Warsaw circle]] is obtained by "closing up" the [[topologist's sine curve]] by an arc connecting (0,&amp;minus;1) and (1,sin(1)). It is a one-dimensional continuum whose [[homotopy group]]s are all trivial, but it is not contractible.

'''Contrafreeloading''' is an observed [[behavior]] in which an organism, when offered a choice between provided food or food that requires effort to obtain, prefers the food that requires effort.

The term was coined in 1963 by animal psychologist Glen Jensen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Glen D.|date=1963-05-01|title=Preference for bar pressing over "freeloading" as a function of number of rewarded presses.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xge/65/5/451|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|language=English|volume=65|issue=5|pages=451–454|doi=10.1037/h0049174|issn=0022-1015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his original study, around 200 [[rat]]s were given a choice between food in a bowl and a food dispenser which required that the rat step on the pedal a set number of times. In this experiment, Jensen found that the rats chose the foot pedal option as a function of the number of foot presses required to receive the food reward. Similar studies by Jensen and other researchers have since replicated his findings with gerbils and other animals including mice, rats, birds, fish, monkeys and chimpanzees. The only animal that did not display similar behavior was the domesticated cat, which preferred to be served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03331767 | doi=10.3758/BF03331767 | volume=24 | title=Feline indolence: Cats prefer free to response-produced food | journal=Psychonomic Science | pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, a '''Δ-set''' ''S'', often called a '''semi-simplicial set''', is a [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] object that is useful in the construction and [[triangulation (topology)|triangulation]] of [[topological space]]s, and also in the computation of related [[Invariant theory|algebraic invariants]] of such spaces.  A Δ-set is somewhat more general than a [[simplicial complex]], yet not quite as general as a [[simplicial set]].

==Definition and related data==
Formally, a '''Δ-set''' is a sequence of sets &lt;math&gt;\{S_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; together with maps

:&lt;math&gt;d_i : S_{n+1} \rightarrow S_n &lt;/math&gt;

with ''i'' = 0,1,...,''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 for ''n'' ≥ 1 that satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; d_i \circ d_j = d_{j-1} \circ d_i &lt;/math&gt;
whenever ''i &lt; j''.

This definition generalizes the notion of a simplicial complex, where the &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; are the sets of ''n''-simplices, and the ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the face maps.  It is not as general as a simplicial set, since it lacks "degeneracies."

Given Δ-sets ''S'' and ''T'', a '''map of Δ-sets''' is a collection
:&lt;math&gt; \{ f_n: S_n \rightarrow T_n \}_{n=0}^{\infty} &lt;/math&gt;
such that
:&lt;math&gt; f_n \circ d_i = d_i \circ f_{n+1} &lt;/math&gt;
whenever both sides of the equation are defined.  With this notion, we can define the '''[[Category (mathematics)|category]] of Δ-sets''', whose objects are Δ-sets and whose morphisms are maps of Δ-sets.

Each Δ-set has a corresponding '''geometric realization''', defined as
:&lt;math&gt;|S| = \left( \coprod_{n=0}^{\infty} S_n \times \Delta^n \right)/_{\sim}&lt;/math&gt;
where we declare that

: &lt;math&gt;(\sigma,d^i t) \sim (d_i \sigma, t) \quad \text{ for all} \quad \sigma \in S_n, t \in \Delta^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Simplex#The standard simplex|standard ''n''-simplex]], and

:&lt;math&gt; d^i : \Delta^{n-1} \rightarrow \Delta^n &lt;/math&gt;

is the inclusion of the ''i''-th face.  The geometric realization is a topological space with the [[quotient topology]].

The geometric realization of a Δ-set ''S'' has a natural [[Filtration (mathematics)|filtration]]
: &lt;math&gt;|S|_0 \subset |S|_1 \subset \cdots \subset |S|, &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;|S|_N = \left( \coprod_{n=0}^{N} S_n \times \Delta^n \right)/_{\sim}&lt;/math&gt;
is a "restricted" geometric realization.

==Related functors==
The geometric realization of a Δ-set described above defines a covariant [[functor]] from the category of Δ-sets to the category of topological spaces.  Geometric realization takes a Δ-set to a topological space, and carries maps of Δ-sets to induced continuous maps between geometric realizations (which are topological spaces).

If ''S'' is a Δ-set, there is an associated free abelian [[chain complex]], denoted &lt;math&gt;( \mathbb{Z} S, \partial )&lt;/math&gt;, whose ''n''-th group is the [[free abelian group]]
: &lt;math&gt; (\mathbb{Z} S)_n = \mathbb{Z} \langle S_n \rangle, &lt;/math&gt;
generated by the set &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;, and whose ''n''-th differential is defined by

: &lt;math&gt; \partial_n = d_0 - d_1 + d_2 - \cdots + (-1)^n d_n. &lt;/math&gt;

This defines a covariant functor from the category of Δ-sets to the category of chain complexes of abelian groups.  A Δ-set is carried to the chain complex just described, and a map of Δ-sets is carried to a map of chain complexes, which is defined by extending the map of Δ-sets in the standard way using the [[universal property]] of free abelian groups.

Given any topological space ''X'', one can construct a Δ-set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sing}(X)&lt;/math&gt; as follows.  A singular ''n''-simplex in ''X'' is a continuous map

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma : \Delta^n \rightarrow X. &lt;/math&gt;

Define

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{sing}_n^{}(X) &lt;/math&gt;

to be the collection of all singular ''n''-simplicies in ''X'', and define

:&lt;math&gt;d_i : \mathrm{sing}_{i+1}(X) \rightarrow \mathrm{sing}_i(X) &lt;/math&gt;

by

:&lt;math&gt; d_i(\sigma) = \sigma \circ d^i,&lt;/math&gt;

where again ''d''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''i''-th face map.  One can check that this is in fact a Δ-set.  This defines a covariant functor from the category of topological spaces to the category of Δ-sets.  A topological space is carried to the Δ-set just described, and a continuous map of spaces is carried to a map of Δ-sets, which is given by composing the map with the singular ''n''-simplices.

==An example==
This example illustrates the constructions described above.  We can create a Δ-set ''S'' whose geometric realization is the unit circle &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;, and use it to compute the [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of this space.  Thinking of &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; as an interval with the endpoints identified, define
:&lt;math&gt; S_0 = \{v\}, \quad S_1 = \{e\}, &lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;S_n = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n ≥ 2''.  The only possible maps &lt;math&gt;d_0,d_1:S_1 \rightarrow S_0,&lt;/math&gt; are
:&lt;math&gt; d_0(e) = d_1(e) = v. \quad&lt;/math&gt;
It is simple to check that this is a Δ-set, and that &lt;math&gt;|S| \cong S^1&lt;/math&gt;.  Now, the associated chain complex &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}S,\partial)&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt; 0 \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z} \langle e \rangle \stackrel{\partial_1}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{Z} \langle v \rangle \longrightarrow 0, &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_1(e) = d_0(e) - d_1(e) = v - v = 0. &lt;/math&gt;
In fact, &lt;math&gt;\partial_n = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n''.  The homology of this chain complex is also simple to compute:
:&lt;math&gt; H_0(\mathbb{Z}S) = \frac{\ker \partial_0}{\mathrm{im} \partial_1} = \mathbb{Z} \langle v \rangle \cong \Z, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; H_1(\mathbb{Z}S) = \frac{\ker \partial_1}{\mathrm{im} \partial_2} = \mathbb{Z} \langle e \rangle \cong \Z. &lt;/math&gt;
All other homology groups are clearly trivial.

One advantage of using Δ-sets in this way is that the resulting chain complex is generally much simpler than the singular chain complex.  For reasonably simple spaces, all of the groups will be finitely generated, whereas the singular chain groups are, in general, not even countably generated.

One drawback of this method is that one must prove that the geometric realization of the Δ-set is actually [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the topological space in question.  This can become a computational challenge as the Δ-set increases in complexity.

One ear receives an isolated third-[[formant]] transition that sounds like a nonspeech chirp. At the same time the other ear receives a base [[syllable]]. This base syllable consists of the first two [[formants]], complete with formant transitions, and the third formant without a transition. Normally, there would be peripheral [[Auditory masking|masking]] in such a [[Sound localization|binaural]] listening task but this does not occur. Instead, the listener's percept is duplex, that is, the completed syllable is perceived and the nonspeech chirp is heard at the same time. This is interpreted as  being due to the existence of a special speech module.

'''Eco-labels''' and '''Green Stickers''' are labeling systems for food and consumer products.  Ecolabels are voluntary, but green stickers are mandated by law; for example, in North America major appliances and automobiles use [[Energy Star]]. They are a form of [[sustainability measurement]] directed at consumers, intended to make it easy to take environmental concerns into account when shopping. Some labels quantify pollution or energy consumption by way of index scores or units of measurement, while others assert compliance with a set of practices or minimum requirements for [[sustainability]] or reduction of harm to the environment. Many ecolabels are focused on minimising the negative [[Human impact on the environment|ecological impact]]s of [[primary production]] or [[resource extraction]] in a given sector or commodity through a set of good practices that are captured in a sustainability standard. Through a verification process, usually referred to as "certification", a farm, forest, [[fishery]], or mine can show that it complies with a standard and earn the right to sell its products as certified through the supply chain, often resulting in a consumer-facing ecolabel.

The last few years have seen two key trends in the ecolabels space. There is an explosion in the numbers of different ecolabelling programs across the world and across business sectors and secondly the proliferation of umbrella labeling programs.

Ecolabelling systems exist for both food and consumer products. Both systems were started by [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, since then the [[European Union]] have developed [[legislation]] for conduct of ecolabelling and also have created their own ecolabels, one for food and one for consumer products. At least for food, the ecolabel is nearly identical with the common NGO definition of the rules for ecolabelling. Label trust is an issue for consumers because as manufacturers and manufacturing associations have set up "rubber stamp" labels to [[greenwash]] their products with fake ecolabels. High trust levels can be created when ecolabels apply for Governmental recognition as formal Certification Marks [recognized by logos or names with 'CTM', CM or 'CertTM']. Typically this means schemes approved as a Certification Mark, have had the Government Department responsible declare that the scheme has a standard and certifies that they are 'Competent to Certify'. The highest trust levels would be a government recognized certification mark that was also compliant with key ISO standards especially ISO 14024- Type 1 Ecolabels that undertake ISO 14040 compliant life cycle analysis as part of their assessment.Type I ecolabels are voluntary labels that signify overall environmental preference of a product or services based on life-cycle considerations that address multiple environmental criteria, which are based on transparent standards for environmental preferability, verified by a qualified organization. 

==ISO Participation==
The last few years have seen two key trends in the ecolabels space. There is an explosion in the numbers of different ecolabelling programs across the world and across business sectors and secondly the proliferation of umbrella labeling programs. The International Organization for Standardization [[ISO]] has created standards for labeling practices within the [[ISO 14000]] schema. '''ISO 14020 to 14025''' series deals with environmental labels and declarations. ISO proposed three categories of environmental labels according to the aspects covered and the rigor required to award the seal: type I in ISO 14024; type II in ISO 14021; and type III in ISO 14025. Additionally, a different category called “Type I – like” is present in the literature, which represents environmental labels focused on just one environmental or social aspect; these labels have been launched by independent organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261630854X|title=ECO-labels as a multidimensional research topic: Trends and opportunities|author=|date=1 November 2016|publisher=|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=135|pages=806–818|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.06.167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecolabeling innovation cycle ==
There is a close relationship between the ecolabeling process and the eco-innovation because it promotes the emergence of new green products and it improves the organizations environmental management strategy. Moreover, ecolabeling process is a "cyclical eco-innovation process in which consumers, firms, governments and institutions interact. Its final purpose is to contribute to the development of sustainable and ecological ways of production and consumption. In this process, consumers’ environmental expectations are met; firms increase their created and captured value and enhance their sustainability, and governments and institutions foster cleaner production and consumption. Finally, this process is tangible in the products through the awarding of ecolabels, which are visibly displayed on goods and services".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prieto-Sandoval|first=Vanessa|last2=Alfaro|first2=José A.|last3=Mejía-Villa|first3=Andrés|last4=Ormazabal|first4=Marta|date=2016-11-01|title=ECO-labels as a multidimensional research topic: Trends and opportunities|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261630854X|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=135|pages=806–818|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.06.167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental governance==
Consumer desires for [[sustainable consumption]] is driving the global marketplace with desire to regulate product production. The globalization of economies is shifting control of sustainability away from traditional command and control measures imposed by governments towards market governance which is a self-regulatory new environmental policy instrument, ecolabelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=A|title=In politics, products, and markets: exploring political consumption|year=2003|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=Somerest, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horne,|first=R.

It is a certification programme with the intention to increase owner, staff, suppliers and stakeholder’s awareness with the intention to motivate them for an eco-friendly action towards a sustainable holiday and future for all of us in the long run and through which expenses can be minimized.

Eco-labeling standardization is a new form of regulation which is voluntary in nature but impose upon large companies market forces in order to harmonize production of goods and services with stronger ecological practices. Recently, it has turned into a new form of non-state authority at both national and international levels. This idea of '''entrepreneurial democracy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lavallee|first=S.|author2=Plouffe S.|title=The eco-label and sustainable development|journal=The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment|volume=9|issue=6|pages=349–354|doi=10.1007/bf02979076}}&lt;/ref&gt;  based on the success of the ISO 14000 standards on the management of environmental quality and the ISO 9000 standards on quality production control.
Once an industry sector decides to get this certification, it has to provide evidence of documented proof of compliance required. In terms of ISO 14042 standard, it is obligatorily for all applicants to respect environmental legislation and related legislation; breaching of any laws may result in licensing suspension.

===Sustainable Initiatives===
During the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Earth Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/enviro.html|title=Earth_Summit|author=|date=|website=www.un.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conference in 1992, an international consensus was generated to integrate environmental issues into manufacturing procedures. The idea was to manipulate consumption patterns in order to achieve [[sustainable development]]. The result of this is as follows.

'''Currently in the''' [[Developed country|developed world]]: Eco-labels and green stickers have evolved to play a vital role. They provide a verifiable link between products and [[informed consumer]] wishes. This approach applies market pressure on industries to minimize their environmental impact; this is evidenced by the growth in the population of [[informed consumer]]s. Marketing strategists are responding with Green Certifications and its abuse, [[Greenwashing]].

'''Currently in the''' [[Developing country|developing world]]: First consumers became concerned about the quality, safety and environmental sustainability of food and supported demand for green foods, then focused on the environmental effects of agriculture and globalization of food production, which led to the exposure of globally controlled food regimes. Consumer advocate groups responded with a call for [Alternative Food Networks].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=K. |author2=Lawrence G. |author3=Richards C|title=Supermarkets’ governance of the agri-food supply chain: is the ‘corporate-environmental’ food regime evident in Australia|journal=International Journal of Society of Agriculture and Food|year=2010|volume=17|issue=2|pages=140–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a new dimension to consumer demands and corporate competitiveness. Australian Consumer Association [[Choice (Australian consumer organization)|CHOICE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choice.com.au/about-us.aspx|title=About us - CHOICE|author=|date=|website=CHOICE|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; confronted corporate interests with their concerns about growing interests in green consumption, food production, use of pesticides, organic production, and genetic modification, etc...

==History==
[[File:GreenStickerC.JPG|right|150px|Proposed International Green Sticker.]]
'''Green Stickers''' on consumer goods have been evolving since the 1970s. The main drivers have been energy and fuel consumption. These stickers first started appearing on major appliances after government agencies in the United States and Canada legislated their requirement. Manufacturers are also required to meet minimum standards of energy use. The automobile industry in North America is required to meet a minimum emissions standard. This led to [[fuel efficiency]] labels being placed on new automobiles sold. The major appliance manufacturers were required to use standard testing practices and place clear labels on products. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] has developed standards for addressing environmental labelling with the [[ISO 14000]] family which grew out of ISO's commitment to support the objective of sustainable development discussed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, in Rio de Janeiro, in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/management_standards/iso_9000_iso_14000/origins_and_iso_tc207.htm |title=ISO/TC 207 |publisher=ISO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Labelling worldwide is moving beyond traditional country borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eco-business.com/features/singapore-green-label-to-go-regional/|title=Singapore Green Label to go regional |publisher=eco-business.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these initiatives are voluntary Eco-labels, however, there is an initiative underway in North America to broaden the scope of Green Stickers to include other consumer goods. Although consumers tend to prefer ecolabeled products, recent research show that consumers do not fully understand ecolabels and do not fully trust ecolabels, especially when learning negative environmental consequences of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xianwen|last2=Alfnes|first2=Frode|last3=Rickertsen|first3=Kyrre|date=2017|title=Consumer Preferences, Ecolabels, and Effects of Negative Environmental Information|url=http://www.agbioforum.org/v18n3/v18n3a11-rickertsen.htm|journal=AgBioForum: The Journal of Agrobiotechnology Management &amp; Economics|volume=18|issue=3|pages=327-336|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Networks==

===GEN===
Founded in 1994, the Global Ecolabelling Network (GEN) is an international non-profit network of third party type I ecolabelling organizations focused on encouraging and promoting type I ecolabelling development worldwide. GEN has members represented from more than 50 territories and countries, with a particular focus in Europe and Asia.
GEN’s mission is to educate and encourage government, industry, and consumers to recognize the unique and important value of Type 1 ecolabelling. More specifically, GEN functions to foster cooperation and information exchange across members and ecolabelling programs, facilities access to information on ecolabelling standards, engages with international organizations to promote ecolabelling, and encourages demand for ecolabelling products through the promotion of sustainable public procurement. GEN supports its members in developing environmental leadership standards and criteria.

===ISEAL===
Created in 2002, the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling Alliance (ISEAL) is a body of sustainability standard organizations set up to advance and develop sustainability standards for products across the globe. Its membership is open to all multi-stakeholder sustainability standards and accreditation bodies that demonstrate their ability to meet the ISEAL Codes of Good Practice and accompanying requirements. Its members are primarily single attribute focused ecolabelling organizations and include the Forest Stewardship Alliance, the Marine Stewardship Council, Fair Trade International, the Rainforest Alliance, and the Alliance for Water Stewardship, among many others. 

The goals of ISEAL Alliance are to improve the impacts of standards, define credibility for sustainability standards, increase the uptake of credible sustainability standards, and improve the effectiveness of standards, including driving innovations in standards.

==Programs by region==

Governments of many countries have [[Environmental Protection Agency|environmental protection agencies]]. These agencies are mandated watchdogs of industry and regulate releasing chemical pollution into the environment.  Some of them administer labelling standards; other set minimum requirements for manufacturers.

===Canada===
The Office of Energy Efficiency (OEE) run by the Department of Natural Resources Canada regulates both the automobile and appliance manufacturers.
EnerGuide label for vehicles found on all new passenger cars, light-duty vans, pickup trucks and special purpose vehicles not exceeding a gross vehicle weight of 3855&amp;nbsp;kg (8500&amp;nbsp;lb). The label shows the city and highway fuel consumption ratings and an estimated annual fuel cost for that particular vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/transportation/personal/buying/energuide-label.cfm?attr=8 |title=Fuel consumption guide |publisher=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Federal law in Canada, under Canada's Energy Efficiency Regulations, requires that the EnerGuide label is placed on all new electrical appliances manufactured in or imported into Canada and that the label indicates the amount of electricity used by that appliance. This information is determined by standardized test procedures. A third-party agency verifies that an appliance meets Canada's minimum energy performance levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/residential/personal/appliances/energuide.cfm?attr=4 |title=Canada's Energy Efficiency Regulations |publisher=Government of Canada |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225164135/http://www.oee.nrcan.gc.ca/residential/personal/appliances/energuide.cfm?attr=4 |archivedate=2010-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Energy Star logo.svg|thumb|150px|right|The Energy Star service mark is placed on energy-efficient products.]]

All major home appliances must meet the Appliance Standards Program set by the US Department of Energy (DOE) on cooperation with the US Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/homes/rea07.shtm |title=U.S. Department of Energy, Home Appliance Regulation|publisher=Federal Trade Commission USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers must use standard test procedures developed by DOE to prove the energy use and efficiency of their products. Test results are printed on yellow EnergyGuide label, which manufacturers are required to display on many appliances. This label estimates how much energy the appliance uses, compares the energy use of similar products, and lists approximate annual operating costs. Appliances that meet strict energy efficiency criteria set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are eligible for the blue [[Energy Star]] label. The Energy Star label is also available on energy-efficient televisions, computers, audio visual equipment and electronics, office equipment, heating and cooling equipment, and many more products. Energy Star is also available on energy efficient homes and buildings in the United States.  American [[automobile]] manufacturers are required to use certified [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] test results and cannot use any other fuel mileage results to advertise vehicle fuel efficiency. The state of California has green sticker license plates issued to [[Off highway vehicle|OHV]]s is introducing green stickers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://driveclean.ca.gov/ep_label.php |title=California Air Resources Board, DRIVECLEAN.ca.gov |publisher=California Air Resources Board USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813082827/http://www.driveclean.ca.gov/ep_label.php |archivedate=2009-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for all new automobiles in 2009. The Australian based US registered Certification Mark Global GreenTag, also operates its service in the USA since 2018.

===European Union===
The [[EU Ecolabel]] was established in 1992 by the European Commission. The EU Ecolabel helps to identify products and services that have a reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle. Recognized throughout Europe, EU Ecolabel is a voluntary label promoting environmental excellence which can be trusted. It is the only pan-European Type I official ecolabel. The EU Ecolabel is awarded according to ecological criteria agreed on by experts, industry, [[consumer organization]]s and [[environmental group|NGO]]s and verified by independent third parties. The implementation of the EU Ecolabel is set through the Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council.

===Northern Europe===
The [[Nordic swan]] is the official ecolabel in Nordic countries.  It uses a system of standards, applications for licenses, and independent verification.

===ASEAN===
In Asia [[ASEAN]] is moving towards adopting the ISO's TC 207 environmental management system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asean.org/7112.htm |title=ASEAN report on environmental labelling |publisher=ASEAN |accessdate=2009-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306044647/http://www.asean.org/7112.htm |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone can contribute verifiable sources substantiating its adoption and implementation by member countries as this information is not easily accessible. The Australian Certification Mark Global GreenTag, is also formally recognised in several ASEAN countries.

===Australia===
A number of ecolabels operate in Australia and New Zealand mostly as separate schemes operating in one country only. Global GreenTag operates internationally and is recognized in both countries as is GECA whereas GECNZ operates only within NZ. All 3 ecolabels are ISO 14024 compliant. GreenTag is also an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) approved Certification Mark.

==Seafood==
There are a plethora of sustainable seafood ecolabels, many conservationists feel that the increasing number of labels is further confusing consumers in regard to what seafood is sustainable. As of 2010, ecolabels that can be found on seafood include Marine Stewardship Council, Friend of the Sea, [[KRAV (Sweden)]], [[Naturland (Germany)]], Thai Quality Shrimp, Global Aquaculture Alliance's [[Best Aquaculture Practices]] standard, Label Rouge (France), among still others, and the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) is in development. Seafood is also labeled "organic" but [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] standards for organic seafood are still in development.

There are a variety of [[dolphin safe label]]s, asserting that tuna is caught in a manner that does not harm [[dolphin]]s.

==Energy==
[[File:EKO symbol RGB.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[EKOenergy]] ecolabel for energy]]
{{Main article|Energy input labeling}}
Many consumer appliances have labels indicating whether or not they are energy efficient compared to similar products.  Common labels include yellow EnergyGuide tags found in North America as part of the [[Energy Star]] program, [[European Union energy label]]s, and the [[Energy Saving Trust Recommended]] logo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421100110/http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/energy_saving_products|title=Energy Saving Products - Energy Saving Trust|author=|date=21 April 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; administrated by the [[Energy Saving Trust]] in the United Kingdom.  These labels document how much energy an appliance consumes while being used; [[energy input labeling]] documents how much energy was used to ''manufacture'' the product, an additional consideration in the full life cycle energy use of product.

[[Carbon emission label]]s are an alternative methodology for certification, examining impact on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions rather than direct energy use.

In [[financial mathematics]], the '''entropic risk measure''' is a [[risk measure]] which depends on the [[risk aversion]] of the user through the [[exponential utility]] function.  It is a possible alternative to other risk measures as [[value-at-risk]] or [[expected shortfall]]. 

It is a theoretically interesting measure because it provides different risk values for different individuals whose attitudes toward risk may differ. However, in practice it would be difficult to use since quantifying the risk aversion for an individual is difficult to do.  The entropic risk measure is the prime example of a [[convex risk measure]] which is not [[Coherent_risk_measure|coherent.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rudloff |first=Birgit |last2=Sass |first2=Jorn |last3=Wunderlich |first3=Ralf |date=July 21, 2008 |title=Entropic Risk Constraints for Utility Maximization |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~brudloff/RudloffSassWunderlich08.pdf |accessdate=July 22, 2010 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018205712/http://www.princeton.edu/~brudloff/RudloffSassWunderlich08.pdf |archivedate=October 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given the connection to [[utility function]]s, it can be used in [[utility maximization problem]]s.

==Mathematical definition==
The entropic risk measure with the risk aversion parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
: &lt;math&gt;\rho^{\mathrm{ent}}(X) = \frac{1}{\theta}\log\left(\mathbb{E}[e^{-\theta X}]\right) = \sup_{Q \in \mathcal{M}_1} \left\{E^Q[-X] -\frac{1}{\theta}H(Q|P)\right\} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Hans|last1=Föllmer|first2=Alexander|last2=Schied|title=Stochastic finance: an introduction in discrete time|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2004|edition=2|isbn=978-3-11-018346-7|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H(Q|P) = E\left[\frac{dQ}{dP}\log\frac{dQ}{dP}\right]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[relative entropy]] of ''Q'' [[Absolutely continuous#Absolute continuity of measures|&lt;&lt;]] ''P''.&lt;ref name="FS10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Follmer|first=Hans|last2=Schied|first2=Alexander|date=October 8, 2008|title=Convex and Coherent Risk Measures|url=http://wws.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~foellmer/papers/CCRM.pdf|accessdate=July 22, 2010|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceptance set==
The [[acceptance set]] for the entropic risk measure is the set of payoffs with positive expected utility.  That is
: &lt;math&gt;A = \{X \in L^p(\mathcal{F}): E[u(X)] \geq 0\} = \{X \in L^p(\mathcal{F}): E\left[e^{-\theta X}\right] \leq 1\}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the exponential utility function.&lt;ref name="FS10" /&gt;

==Dynamic entropic risk measure==
The [[conditional risk measure]] associated with dynamic entropic risk with risk aversion parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\rho^{\mathrm{ent}}_t(X) = \frac{1}{\theta}\log\left(\mathbb{E}[e^{-\theta X} | \mathcal{F}_t]\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This is a [[time consistent]] risk measure if &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is constant through time.&lt;ref name="penner_thesis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Penner |first=Irina |year=2007 |title=Dynamic convex risk measures: time consistency, prudence, and sustainability |url=http://wws.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~penner/penner.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719042923/http://wws.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~penner/penner.pdf |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4181">The '''European Public Hearing on European Conscience and Crimes of Totalitarian Communism: 20 Years After''' was a European public hearing organised by the Czech [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency]] of the [[European Union]] in the [[European Parliament]] on 18 March 2009. The hearing was described by the Presidency as "the third step towards the establishment of a [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience|European Platform of Memory and Conscience]] to support the activities of institutions engaged in reconciling with totalitarian regimes in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ustrcr.cz/en/hearing-in-the-european-parliament-on-the-crimes-of-communism |title= Hearing in the European Parliament on the Crimes of Communism: Third step towards European platform of memory and conscience – a Czech Presidency initiative |publisher=[[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] |date= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hearing was hosted by the Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs [[Alexandr Vondra]] and the Permanent Representative of the Czech Republic to the European Union [[Milena Vicenová]] on behalf of the Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union, in cooperation with [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s supporting the [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism|Prague Declaration]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ustrcr.cz/data/pdf/tiskove_zpravy/hearing-brussels-2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The first session, chaired by [[Tunne Kelam]] MEP, included speeches by [[Pavel Žáček]] (Director, [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]]), Emmanuel Crabit ([[European Commission]] Directorate-General of Justice, Freedom and Security), [[Emanuelis Zingeris]] (Chairman, International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania), [[Marius Oprea]] ([[Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes in Romania]]), Hans Altendorf (Office of the [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]]), Vasil Kadrinov ([[Hannah Arendt Center]]), [[Nicolas Werth]] (Institute for Contemporary History, [[CNRS]]), and Camilla Andersson ([[Institute for Information on the Crimes of Communism]]).

The second session, chaired by [[Jana Hybášková]] MEP, included speeches by [[Alexandr Vondra]] (Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs of the Czech Republic), [[Ján Figeľ]] ([[European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth|European Commissioner for Education]]), [[Alejo Vidal-Quadras]] MEP ([[Vice President of the European Parliament]]), [[Jan Zahradil]] MEP, [[László Tökés]] MEP, and [[Sandra Kalniete]] (former European Commissioner).

The conclusions called for "the establishment of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience" and supported the proclamation of the [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]].&lt;ref name=ConclusionsEUHearing2009&gt;{{cite web|title=Conclusions of the Public Hearing in the European Parliament  organised by the Czech Presidency of the European Union: European Conscience and Crimes of Totalitarian Communism: 20 Years After|url=http://www.ustrcr.cz/data/pdf/tiskove_zpravy/slyseni-brusel-final-conclusions.pdf|publisher=[[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union]]|accessdate=2011-05-14|date=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4100">'''Evaluative conditioning''' is defined as a change in the valence of a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] that is due to the pairing of that stimulus with another positive or negative stimulus. The first stimulus is often referred to as the conditioned stimulus and the second stimulus as the unconditioned stimulus. A conditioned stimulus becomes more positive when it has been paired with a positive unconditioned stimulus and more negative when it has been paired with a negative unconditioned stimulus.{{sfn|Hofmann |De Houwer |Perugini |Baeyens|2010|p=391}} Evaluative conditioning thus refers to attitude formation or change toward an object due to that object's mere co-occurrence with another object.{{sfn|Jones|Olson|Fazio|2010|p=205}}

Evaluative conditioning is a form of [[classical conditioning]], as invented by [[Ivan Pavlov]], in that it involves a change in the responses to the conditioned stimulus that results from pairing the conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus. Whereas classic conditioning can refer to a change in any type of response, evaluative conditioning concerns only a change in the evaluative responses to the conditioned stimulus, that is, a change in the liking of the conditioned stimulus.{{sfn|Hofmann |De Houwer |Perugini |Baeyens|2010|p=391}}

A classic example of the formation of attitudes through conditioning is the 1958 experiment by Staats and Staats.{{sfn|Staats|Staats|1958}} Subjects first were asked to learn a list of words that were presented visually, and were tested on their learning of the list. They then did the same with a list of words presented orally, all of which set the stage for the critical phase of the experiment which was portrayed as an assessment of subjects’ ability to learn via both visual and auditory channels at once. During this phase, subjects were exposed visually to a set of nationality names, specifically Dutch and Swedish. Approximately one second after the nationality appeared on the screen, the experimenter announced a word aloud. Most of these latter words, none of which were repeated, were neutral (e.g., chair, with, twelve). Included, however, were a few positive words (e.g., gift, sacred, happy) and a few negative words (e.g., bitter, ugly, failure). These words were systematically paired with the two conditional stimuli nationalities such that one always appeared with positive words and the other with negative words. Thus, the conditioning trials were embedded within a stream of visually presented nationality names and orally presented words. When the conditioning phase was completed, the subjects were first asked to recall the words that had been presented visually and then to evaluate them, presumably because how they felt about those words might have affected their learning. The conditioning was successful. The nationality that had been paired with the more positive unconditional stimuli was rated as more pleasant than the one paired with the negative unconditional stimuli.{{sfn|Jones|Olson|Fazio|2010|p=205-206}}

__NOTOC__
'''Extension neglect'''{{efn|The concept of ''extensionality'' is used throughout Kahneman and Tversky's research as synonymous of ''extent'' (range, size) of the set. It should not be confused with [[Kenneth Arrow|Arrow]]'s concept of ''extensionality'', which in Kahneman and Tversky's work is called ''invariance''.}} is a type of [[cognitive bias]] that occurs when the mind tends to ignore the size of the set during an evaluation in which the size of the set is logically relevant.&lt;ref name=Kahneman2000&gt;{{harvnb|Kahneman|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extension neglect is described as being caused by [[judgment by prototype]], of which the [[representativeness heuristic]] is a special case.

Forms of extension neglect include:

* [[base rate neglect]]
* [[insensitivity to sample size]]
* [[scope neglect]]
*[[duration neglect]]
** the [[peak-end rule]]
* the [[conjunction fallacy]]
* the [[less-is-better effect]]

The extension effect is "neither universal nor absolute". If attention is drawn to set size in an easily interpretable way, an '''additive extension effect''' is reported, according to which the valuation of a set is a function of the valuation of a prototypical member of the set ''added'' to set size, rather than ''multiplied''.&lt;ref name=Kahneman2000 /&gt;

[[File:Definition of Free Cultural Works logo notext.svg|thumb|[[Free Cultural Works]] logo|alt=|219x219px]]
'''Free content''', '''[[Gratis versus libre|libre]] content''', or '''free information''', is any kind of functional work, [[work of art]], or other creative [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] that meets the definition of a [[Definition of Free Cultural Works|free cultural work]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Definition ==
A ''free cultural work'' (free content) is, according to the [[definition of Free Cultural Works]], one that has no significant legal restriction on people's freedom to:
*use the content and benefit from using it,
*study the content and apply what is learned,
*make and distribute copies of the content,
*change and improve the content and distribute these derivative works.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freedomdefined.org/Definition |title=Definition of Free Cultural Works |version=1.1 |publisher=freedomdefined.org |author=Erik Möller, e.a. |authorlink=Erik Möller |date=2008 |accessdate=2015-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html |title=Free Software and Free Manuals |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |last=Stallman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stallman |date=November 13, 2008 |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free content encompasses all works in the [[public domain]] and also those [[copyright]]ed works whose [[license]]s honor and uphold the freedoms mentioned above. Because the [[Berne Convention]] in most countries by default grants copyright holders [[monopoly|monopolistic control]] over their creations, copyright content must be explicitly declared free, usually by the referencing or inclusion of licensing statements from within the work.

Although there are a great many different definitions in regular everyday use, free content is legally very similar, if not like an identical twin, to [[open content]]. An analogy is the use of the rival terms free software and open source, which describe ideological differences rather than legal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html |title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software |last=Stallman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stallman |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twobits.net/pub/Kelty-TwoBits.pdf |title=The Cultural Significance of free Software - Two Bits |first=Christpher M. |last=Kelty |publisher=[[Duke University]] press - durham and london |year=2008 |pages=99 |quote=''Prior to 1998, Free Software referred either to the Free Software Foundation (and the watchful, micromanaging eye of Stallman) or to one of thousands of different commercial, avocational, or university-research projects, processes, licenses, and ideologies that had a variety of names: sourceware, freeware, shareware, open software, public domain software, and so on. The term Open Source, by contrast, sought to encompass them all in one movement.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raymondCall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html |title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source" |publisher=Catb.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]]'s ''[[The Open Definition|Open Definition]]'' describes "open" as synonymous to the definition of ''free'' in the "Definition of Free Cultural Works" (as also in the [[Open Source Definition]] and [[Free Software Definition]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/ Open Definition 2.1] on opendefinition.org ''"This essential meaning matches that of "open" with respect to software as in the Open Source Definition and is synonymous with "free" or "libre" as in the Free Software Definition and Definition of Free Cultural Works."''&lt;/ref&gt; For such free/open content both movements recommend the same three [[Creative Commons license]]s, the [[CC BY]], [[CC BY-SA]], and [[CC0]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/licenses/ licenses] on opendefinition.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2013/12/27/creative-commons-4-0-by-and-by-sa-licenses-approved-conformant-with-the-open-definition/ Creative Commons 4.0 BY and BY-SA licenses approved conformant with the Open Definition] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.org (December 27th, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2014/10/07/open-definition-2-0-released/ Open Definition 2.0 released] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.org (October 7th, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WellcomeTrustReport" /&gt;

==Legal matters==
===Copyright===
[[File:Copyright.svg|thumb|100px|[[copyright]]]]
{{Main article|Copyright}}
Copyright is a legal concept, which gives the author or creator of a work legal control over the [[copying|duplication]] and public performance of his or her work. In many jurisdictions, this is limited by a time period after which the works then enter the [[public domain]]. Copyright laws are a balance between the rights of creators of intellectual and artistic works and the rights of others to build upon those works. During the time period of copyright the author's work may only be copied, modified, or publicly performed with the consent of the author, unless the use is a [[fair use]].
Traditional copyright control limits the use of the work of the author to those who either pay royalties to the author for usage of the authors content, or limit their use to fair use. Secondly it limits the use of content whose author cannot be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/orphan/ |title=The Importance of Orphan Works Legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally it creates a perceived barrier between authors by limiting derivative works, such as [[Mashup (music)|mashup]]s and collaborative content&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818801000710|title=Fair use and copyright protection: a price theory explanation |journal=International Review of Law and Economics|author=Ben Depoorter|author2= Francesco Parisi|doi=10.1016/S0144-8188(01)00071-0 |year=2002 |volume=21|issue=4|page=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public domain===
[[File:PD-icon.svg|thumb|100px|[[public domain]]]]
{{Main article|Public domain}}
The public domain is a range of creative works whose [[copyright]] has expired, or was never established; as well as ideas and facts&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The copyright status of uncreative aggregates of basic data may differ by region, for the USA see ''[[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service]]'', for [[Australia]], see ''[[Telstra v Desktop Marketing Systems]]''&lt;/ref&gt; which are ineligible for copyright. A public domain work is a work whose author has either relinquished to the public, or no longer can claim control over, the distribution and usage of the work. As such any person may manipulate, distribute, or otherwise utilize the work, without legal ramifications. A work in the public domain or released under a permissive licence may be referred to as "[[copycenter]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/C/copycenter.html |title=Copycenter |last=Raymond |first=Eric S. |authorlink=Eric S. Raymond |publisher=The [[Jargon File]] |accessdate=August 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyleft===
{{main|Copyleft}}
[[File:Copyleft.svg|thumb|100px|[[copyleft]]]]
Copyleft is a play on the word copyright and describes the practice of using copyright law to remove restrictions on distributing copies and modified versions of a work.&lt;ref name="Dusollier"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Open source and copyleft. Authorship reconsidered?|author=Dusollier, S|series=Columbia journal of Law and the Arts|year=2003|volume=26|issue=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of copyleft is to use the legal framework of copyright to enable non-author parties to be able to reuse and, in many licensing schemes, modify content that is created by an author. Unlike works in the public domain, the author still maintains copyright over the material, however the author has granted a non-exclusive license to any person to distribute, and often modify, the work. Copyleft licenses require that any [[derivative work]]s be distributed under the same terms, and that the original copyright notices be maintained.
A symbol commonly associated with copyleft is a reversal of the [[copyright symbol]], facing the other way; the opening of the C points left rather than right. Unlike the copyright symbol, the copyleft symbol does not have a codified meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=G. Brent |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |title=Open Source Approaches in Spatial Data Handling |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JZNuu8XODQMC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=copyleft+symbol+legal+meaning |isbn=3-540-74830-X |accessdate=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Projects that provide free content exist in several areas of interest, such as software, academic literature, general literature, music, images, video, and [[engineering]].
Technology has reduced the cost of publication and reduced the entry barrier sufficiently to allow for the production of widely disseminated materials by individuals or small groups. Projects to provide free literature and multimedia content have become increasingly prominent owing to the ease of dissemination of materials that is associated with the development of computer technology. Such dissemination may have been too costly prior to these technological developments.

===Media===
[[File:Cc.logo.circle.svg|thumb|100px|[[Creative Commons]]]]
In media, which includes textual, audio, and visual content, free licensing schemes such as some of the licenses made by [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons]] have allowed for the dissemination of works under a clear set of legal permissions. Not all of the Creative Commons’ licenses are entirely free: their permissions may range from very liberal general redistribution and modification of the work to a more restrictive redistribution-only licensing. Since February 2008, Creative Commons licenses which are entirely free carry a badge indicating that they are "approved for free cultural works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8051 |title=Approved for Free Cultural Works |accessdate=March 22, 2009| last=Linksvayer |first=Mike |authorlink=Mike Linksvayer |date= February 20, 2008| publisher=[[Creative Commons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital library|Repositories]] exist which exclusively feature free material and provide content such as photographs, [[clip art]], music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://irate.sourceforge.net/ |title=iRate Radio |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |publisher=[[SourceForge.net]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228222010/http://irate.sourceforge.net/ |archivedate=February 28, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and literature,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:No_Cost_or_Freedom%3F |title=Gutenberg:No Cost or Freedom? |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |date=April 23, 2007 |publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While extensive reuse of free content from one website in another website is legal, it is usually not sensible because of the [[duplicate content]] problem. [[Wikipedia]] is amongst the most well known databases of user uploaded free content on the web. While the vast majority of content on Wikipedia is free content, some copyrighted material is hosted under [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|Fair-use criteria]].

===Software===
[[File:Opensource.svg|thumb|right|100px|[[Open Source Initiative|OSI]] logo]]
[[File:FSF-Logo_part.svg|thumb|right|100px|[[Free Software Foundation|FSF]] logo]]
{{main article|Free and open-source software}}
[[Free and open-source software]], which is also often referred to as [[open source software]] and [[free software]], is a maturing technology with major companies utilising free software to provide both services and technology to both end users and technical consumers. The ease of dissemination has allowed for increased modularity, which allows for smaller groups to contribute to projects as well as simplifying collaboration.
Open source development models have been classified as having a similar peer-recognition and collaborative benefit incentives that are typified by more classical fields such as scientific research, with the social structures that result from this incentive model decreasing production cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/staff/herkia/kava/Seminnarit/MI_mustonen.pdf |title=Copyleft – the economics of Linux and other open source software |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |version=Discussion Paper No. 493 |last=Mustonen |first=Mikko |publisher=Department of Economics, [[University of Helsinki]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Given sufficient interest in a software component, by using [[peer-to-peer]] distribution methods, distribution costs of software may be reduced, removing the burden of infrastructure maintenance from developers. As distribution resources are simultaneously provided by consumers, these software distribution models are scalable, that is the method is feasible regardless of the number of consumers. In some cases, free software vendors may use peer-to-peer technology as a method of dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/28/33/44/PDF/RR-6519.pdf |title=The Practice of Free and Open Source Software Processes |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |volume=N° 6519 |issue=April 2008 |date=May 29, 2008 |version=inria-00274193, version 2 |author1=Pawlak, Michel |author2=Bryce, Ciarán |author3=Laurière, Stéphane |journal=Rapport de recherche |publisher=[[Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique]] (INRIA) |issn=0249-6399 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In general, project hosting and code distribution is not a problem for the most of free projects as [[Comparison of open source software hosting facilities|a number of providers]] offer them these services free.

===Engineering and technology===
[[File:Open-source-hardware-logo.svg|thumb|100px|[[Open source hardware]] logo]]
Free content principles have been translated into fields such as engineering, where designs and engineering knowledge can be readily shared and duplicated, in order to reduce overheads associated with project development. [[Open design]] principles can be applied in engineering and technological applications, with projects in [[mobile telephony]], small-scale manufacture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/03/04/reprap-open-source-3d-printer-masses |title=RepRap: An open-source 3D printer for the masses |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |last=Hendry |first=Andrew |date=March 4, 2008 |work=[[Computerworld]] Australia |publisher=[[The Industry Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the automotive industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/tr/Das-offenste-aller-Autos--/artikel/68663/ |title=The most open of all cars |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |last=Honsig |first= Markus |date=January 25, 2006 |work=[[Technology Review]] |publisher=[[Heinz Heise]] |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/drive/australian-drive-for-green-commuter-cars-20100613-y64q.html|title=Australian drive for green commuter cars|date=14 June 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |location=Sydney |accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even agricultural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isb.vt.edu/news/2005/artspdf/dec0501.pdf |title=Open-source Agriculture |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |last=Stewart Jr. |first=C. Neal |date=December 2005 |work= ISB News Report |publisher=Information Systems for Biotechnology (ISB) |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Technologies such as distributed manufacturing can allow [[computer-aided manufacturing]] and [[computer-aided design]] techniques to be able to develop small-scale production of components for the development of new, or repair of existing, devices. Rapid fabrication technologies underpin these developments, which allow end users of technology to be able to construct devices from pre-existing blueprints, using software and manufacturing hardware to convert information into physical objects.

===Academia===
[[File:Open Access logo PLoS white.svg|thumb|100px|[[Open access (publishing)|open access]]]]
{{main article|Open access (publishing)}}
In academic work, the majority of works are not free, although the percentage of works that are open access is growing rapidly. [[Open access]] refers to online [[research]] outputs that are free of all restrictions on access (e.g. access tolls) and free of many restrictions on use (e.g. certain copyright and license restrictions).&lt;ref name="earlham.edu"&gt;Suber, Peter.

[[Open content]] publication has been seen as a method of reducing costs associated with information retrieval in research, as universities typically pay to subscribe for access to content that is published through traditional means&lt;ref name="WellcomeTrustReport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Costs and business models in scientific research publishing: A report commissioned by the Wellcome Trust|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/stellent/groups/corporatesite/@policy_communications/documents/web_document/wtd003184.pdf|accessdate=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Libraries face higher costs for academic journals |last=Mayor |first=Susan |date=April 19, 2003 |journal=[[BMJ]]: British Medical Journal |publisher=[[BMJ Group]] |volume=326 |issue=7394 |page=840 |pmc=1125769}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/membership/journal-survey.html|title=AMS Journal price survey|accessdate=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst improving journal quality by discouraging the submission of research articles of reduced quality.&lt;ref name="WellcomeTrustReport"/&gt;
Subscriptions for non-free content journals may be expensive for universities to purchase, though the article are written and peer-reviewed by academics themselves at no cost to the publisher.

For teaching purposes, some universities, including MIT, provide freely available course content, such as lecture notes, video resources and tutorials. This content is distributed via Internet resources to the general public. Publication of such resources may be either by a formal institution-wide program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/about/about/index.htm|title=About OpenCourseWare|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternately via informal content provided by individual academics or departments.

===Legislation===
Any country has its own law and legal system, sustained by its legislation, a set of law-documents &amp;mdash; documents containing [[Statutory law|statutory]] [[:Category:Law of obligations|obligation rules]], usually [[law]] and created by [[legislature]]s.  In a [[Rule of law|democratic country]], each law-document is published as [[#Media|open media content]], is in principle a free content; but in general there are no explicit license attributed for each law-document, so the license must be interpreted, is a ''[[implied license]]''.
Only few countries have explicit licenses in its law-documents, as the UK's [[Open Government Licence]] (a [[CC-BY]] compatible license).
In the other countries, the ''implied license'' comes from its proper rules (general laws and rules about copyright in government works). The automatic protection provided by [[Berne Convention]] not apply to law-documents: Article 2.4 excludes the official texts from the automatic protection.
It is also possible to "inherit" the license from context. The set of country's law-documents is made available through national repositories. Examples of law-document open repositories: [[LexML Brazil]], [[Legislation.gov.uk]], [[EUR-Lex#N-Lex|N-Lex of EU countries]]. In general a law-document is offered in more than one (open) official version, but the main one is that published by a [[government gazette]]. So, law-documents can eventually inherit license expressed by the repository or by the gazette that contains it.

'''Identity disorder''' in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]], was first listed as a separate diagnosis in version III (1980). In version IV (1994), it was replaced by "[[DSM-IV codes#Additional codes|Identity problem]]", which was not defined as a mental disorder per se, but was listed in a chapter containing problems that might be a focus of clinical attention. Identity disorder was 'downgraded' to Identity problem as research indicated that distress over one's identity is so common that it might very well be considered part of the [[Normality (behavior)|normality]]. In practice, if a person's distress persisted or worsened, an Identity problem would often be succeeded by a diagnosis of an actual disorder, such as a [[mood disorder]] or [[borderline personality disorder]]. In [[DSM-5]] (2013), "Identity problem" was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1=Judith L. | last1=Rapoport | first2=Deborah R. | last2=Ismond | title=DSM-IV Training Guide for Diagnosis of Childhood Disorders | year=1996 | page=282 | isbn=978-0876307663 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AmJH3Iwf2kC&amp;lpg=PA282&amp;pg=PA282#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1=James E. | last1=Côté | first2=Charles G. | last2=Levine | title=Identity Formation, Agency, and Culture: A Social Psychological Synthesis | year=2002 | page=155 | isbn=978-1135650049 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cyh5AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP155&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intentional infliction of emotional distress''' ('''IIED'''; sometimes called the '''tort of outrage''')&lt;ref name= Cusimano/&gt; is a [[common law]] [[tort]] that allows individuals to recover for severe emotional distress caused by another individual who intentionally or recklessly inflicted emotional distress by behaving in an "extreme and outrageous" way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|title=Religiously Motivated "Outrageous" Conduct: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress as a Weapon Against 'Other People's Faiths'|first=Paul T.|last=Hayden|journal=William &amp; Mary Law Review|volume=34|issue=3|year=1993|page=579|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1853&amp;context=wmlr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some courts and commentators have substituted ''mental'' for ''emotional'', but the tort is the same.&lt;ref name= Cusimano &gt;{{cite web|last1=Cusimano|first1=Gregory S|title=Tort of Outrage|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=1-23+Alabama+Tort+Law+23.syn&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=5932&amp;key=c78c33472985632cff2ff07820298bd8|publisher=LexisNexis|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale for classification==
IIED was created in tort law to address a problem that would arise when applying the common law form of [[assault]]. The common law tort of assault did not allow for liability when a threat of [[battery (tort)|battery]] was not imminent. A common case would be a future threat of harm that would not constitute common law assault, but would nevertheless cause emotional harm to the recipient. IIED was created to guard against this kind of emotional abuse, thereby allowing a victim of emotional distress to receive compensation in situations where he or she would otherwise be barred from compensation under the common law form.

According to the first doctrine articulated by common law courts, a plaintiff could not recover for physical injury from fright alone absent a physical impact from an external source ("shock without impact"), even if the fright was proven to have resulted from a defendant's negligence, with the case on point referring to the negligent operation of a railroad.&lt;ref&gt;For English law, see ''Victorian Railways Commissioners v. Coultas'' (1888) 13 AC 222 (woman barred from recovery due to shock despite suffering a miscarriage); for a similar decision in New York in the same month, see ''Lehman v. Brooklyn City Railroad Co.'', 47 Hun (N.Y.) 355 (1888).&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with intentional conduct, absent material damage, claims for emotional harm were similarly barred.  "Mental pain or anxiety, the law cannot value, and does not pretend to redress, when the unlawful act causes that alone.  Though where a material damage occurs, and is connected with it, it is impossible a jury, in estimating it, should altogether overlook the feelings of the party interested."&lt;ref&gt;Lord Wensleydale, Lynch v. Knight (1861) 9 HLC 577 at 598; 11 ER 854, where a married woman unsuccessful sought redress for "slanderous imputation of unchastity"&lt;/ref&gt;  Courts had been reluctant to accept a tort for emotional harm for fear of opening a "wide door" to frivolous claims.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell v. Rochester Railway Co. 151 NY 107 (1896)&lt;/ref&gt;

A change first occurred in the [[History of Ireland (1801–1923)|Irish]] courts which repudiated the English railroad decision and recognised liability for "nervous shock" in the ''Byrne'' (1884) and ''Bell'' (1890) cases &lt;ref&gt;see ''Bell v. Great Northern Railway of Ireland'' (1895) 26 LR (Ir) 428; also citing an unreported decision in ''Byrne v. Great Southern and Western R. Co. of Ireland''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In England, the idea that physical/mental shock without impact from an external source should be a bar to recovery was first questioned at the Queen's Bench in ''Pugh v. London etc. Railroad Co.''&lt;ref&gt;[1896] 2 QB 248&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, the Queen's Bench formally recognised the tort, for the first time, in the case of {{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Wilkinson v Downton]]|court=EWHC|division=QB|year=1897|num=1|parallelcite=[1897] 2 QB 57 }}, although it was referred to as "intentional infliction of mental shock".  ''Wilkinson'' has been subsequently approved by both the Court of Appeal (''[[Janvier v Sweeney]]'' [1919] 2 KB 316) and House of Lords ({{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Wainwright v Home Office]]|link=|court=UKHL|year=2003|num=53|parallelcite= [2004] 2 AC 406}}).  Citing ''Pugh'' and the Irish courts as precedent, the ''Wilkinson'' court noted the willful nature of the act as a direct cause of the harm.

==Elements==
# Defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; and
# Defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous; and
# Defendant's act is the cause of the distress; and
# Plaintiff suffers severe emotional distress as a result of defendant's conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trucounsel.com/index.php/intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress|title=Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress - Trucounsel.com|author=|date=2 August 2011|website=trucounsel.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intentional or reckless act===
It is not necessary that an act be ''intentionally'' offensive. A reckless disregard for the likelihood of causing emotional distress is sufficient. For example, if a [[defendant]] refused to inform a [[plaintiff]] of the whereabouts of the plaintiff's child for several years, though that defendant knew where the child was the entire time, the defendant could be held liable for IIED even though the defendant had no intent to cause distress to the plaintiff.

===Extreme and outrageous conduct===
The conduct must be heinous and beyond the standards of civilized decency or utterly intolerable in a civilized society. Whether the conduct is illegal does not determine whether it meets this standard. IIED is also known as the tort of "outrage", due to a classic formulation of the standard: the conduct must be such that it would cause a [[reasonable person]] to feel extremely offended, shocked, and/or outraged.

Some general factors that will persuade that the conduct was extreme and outrageous (1) there was a pattern of conduct, not just an isolated incident; (2) the plaintiff was vulnerable and the defendant knew it; (3) the defendant was in a position of power; (4) racial epithets were used; and (5) the defendant owed the plaintiff a [[fiduciary duty]].&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v. Metzger'', 706 A.2d 685 (N.J. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GTE&gt;''GTE Southwest, Inc. v. Bruce'', 998 S.W.2d 605 (Tex. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causation===
The actions of the defendant must have actually caused the plaintiff's emotional distress beyond the bounds of decency. IIED can be done through speech or action; if emotional stress, must manifest physically.&lt;ref  name=GTE /&gt;

===Qualification===
The emotional distress suffered by the plaintiffs must be "severe."  This standard is quantified by the intensity, duration, and any physical manifestations of the distress.  A lack of productivity or a mental disorder, documented by a mental health professional, is typically required here, although acquaintances' testimony about a change in behavior could be persuasive. Extreme sadness, anxiety, or anger in conjunction with a personal injury (though not necessarily) may also qualify for compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emotional Distress and Defamation in Personal Injury Cases|url=http://lawyersatlanta.com/emotional-distress-and-defamation-in-personal-injury-cases/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029055937/http://lawyersatlanta.com/emotional-distress-and-defamation-in-personal-injury-cases/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 October 2015|publisher=Slappey &amp; Sadd|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an act which might form the basis for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress would be sending a letter to an individual falsely informing the person that a close family member had been killed in an accident.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2015}}

==Pleading practices==
In [[civil procedure]] systems (such as in the United States) that allow plaintiffs to plead multiple alternative theories that may overlap or even contradict each other, a plaintiff will usually bring an action for both intentional infliction of emotional distress and [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]] (NIED). This is just in case the plaintiff later discovers that it is impossible to prove at trial the necessary ''[[mens rea]]'' of [[intent (law)|intent]]; even then, the jury may still be able to rule for them on the NIED claim.

There are some reported cases in which a plaintiff will bring ''only'' a NIED claim even though a reasonable neutral observer could conclude that the defendant's behavior was probably intentional. This is usually because the defendant may have some kind of insurance coverage (like homeowners' insurance or automobile liability insurance). As a matter of public policy, insurers are barred from covering intentional torts like IIED, but may be liable for NIED committed by their policyholders, and therefore are targeted indirectly in this fashion as [[deep pocket]]s.

==First Amendment considerations==
The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Hustler Magazine v. Falwell|Hustler v. Falwell]]'' involved an IIED claim brought by the evangelist [[Jerry Falwell]] against the publisher of [[Hustler|Hustler Magazine]] for a [[parody]] ad that described Falwell as having lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse. The Court ruled that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protected such parodies of public figures from civil liability.&lt;ref&gt;''Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell'', 485 U.S. 46 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Standard Classification of Education''' ('''ISCED''') is a statistical framework for organizing information on [[education]] maintained by the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]]. It is a member of the international family of economic and social classifications of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/ United Nations Statistics Division: ''UN Classifications Registry''], retrieved 30-03-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ISCED was designed in the early 2009 to serve ‘as an instrument suitable for assembling, compiling and presenting statistics of education both within individual countries and internationally’.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2016. ''International Standard Classification of Education: ISCED 2001'. http://www.uis.unesco.org/Library/Documents/isced97-en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The first version, known as ISCED 2001, was approved by the International Conference on Education (Geneva, 1975), and was subsequently endorsed by UNESCO’s 19th General Conference in 1976.

The second version, known as ISCED 1997, was approved by the UNESCO General Conference at its 29th session in November 1997 as part of efforts to increase the international comparability of education statistics. It covered primarily two cross-classification variables: ''levels'' (7) and ''fields'' of education (25). The UNESCO Institute for Statistics led the development of a third version, which was adopted by UNESCO’s 36th General Conference in November 2011 and which will replace ISCED 1997 in international data collections in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/isced-2011-en.pdf Revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)], retrieved 05-04-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ISCED 2011 has 9 rather than 7 levels, created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels. It also extended the lowest level (ISCED 0) to cover a new sub-category of early childhood educational development programmes, which target children below the age of 3 years.

During the review and revision, which led to the adoption of ISCED 2011, UNESCO Member States agreed that the fields of education should be examined in a separate process. This review is now underway with the view to establishing an independent but related classification called the ISCED Fields of Education and Training.

! Level
! Description
! Principal characteristics
|-
|  0
| Pre-primary education
| Initial stage of organized instruction, designed primarily to introduce very young children to a school-type environment and to develop their cognitive, physical, social and emotional skills. Designed for children from age 3 to the start of primary education.
|-
|  1
| [[Primary education]] or first stage of [[basic education]]
| Normally starting between the ages of 5 – 7, designed to give a sound basic education in reading, writing and mathematics along with an elementary understanding of other subjects.
|-
|  2
| [[Lower secondary school|Lower secondary education]] or second stage of [[basic education]]
| Designed to complete basic education, usually on a more subject-oriented pattern. It builds upon the learning outcomes from primary education (ISCED level 1) and aims to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human development.
|-
|  3
| [[Upper secondary school|Upper secondary education]]
| More specialized education typically beginning at age 15 or 16 years and/or completes secondary education in preparation for tertiary education, or to provide skills relevant to employment, or both.
|-
|  4
| Post-secondary non-tertiary education
| Programmes that straddle the boundary between upper- and post-secondary education from an international point of view. ISCED level 4 programmes, considering their content, cannot be regarded as tertiary programmes. They are often not significantly more advanced than programmes at ISCED level 3 but they serve to broaden the knowledge of participants who have already completed a programme at level 3.
|-
|  5
| First stage of tertiary education  
| Tertiary programmes having an educational content more advanced than those offered at ISCED levels 3 and 4. These programmes may be academically based or practically oriented / occupationally specific. Entry to these programmes normally requires the successful completion of ISCED level 3A or 3B or a similar qualification at ISCED level 4A. All degrees and qualifications are cross-classified by type of programmes, position in national degree or qualification structures and cumulative duration at tertiary.
|-
|  6
| Second stage of tertiary education 
| Tertiary programmes leading to the award of an advanced research qualification, e.g. [[Ph.D.]] These programmes are therefore devoted to advanced study and original research and are not based on course-work only. It typically requires the submission of a thesis or dissertation of publishable quality which is the product of original research and represents a significant contribution to knowledge.

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
In [[category theory]] and its applications to other branches of [[mathematics]], '''kernels''' are a generalization of the kernels of [[group homomorphism]]s, the kernels of [[module homomorphism]]s and certain other [[kernel (algebra)|kernels from algebra]]. Intuitively, the kernel of the [[morphism]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is the "most general" morphism ''k'' : ''K'' → ''X'' that yields zero when composed with (followed by) ''f''.

Note that [[kernel pair]]s and [[difference kernel]]s (also known as binary [[Equaliser (mathematics)|equaliser]]s) sometimes go by the name "kernel"; while related, these aren't quite the same thing and are not discussed in this article.

==Definition==
Let '''C''' be a [[category theory|category]].
In order to define a kernel in the general category-theoretical sense, '''C''' needs to have [[zero morphism]]s.
In that case, if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is an arbitrary [[morphism]] in '''C''', then a kernel of ''f'' is an [[Equaliser (mathematics)|equaliser]] of ''f'' and the zero morphism from ''X'' to ''Y''.
In symbols:
:ker(''f'') = eq(''f'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''XY''&lt;/sub&gt;)

To be more explicit, the following [[universal property]] can be used. A kernel of ''f'' is an object ''K'' together with a morphism ''k'' : ''K'' → ''X'' such that:
* ''f'' ∘ ''k'' is the zero morphism from ''K'' to ''Y'';

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;[[File:First_property_of_the_kernel.svg|100px]]&lt;/div&gt;

* [[Given any]] morphism ''k''&amp;prime; : ''K''&amp;prime; → ''X'' such that ''f'' ∘ ''k''&amp;prime; is the zero morphism, there is a [[unique (mathematics)|unique]] morphism ''u'' : ''K''&amp;prime; → ''K'' such that ''k'' ∘ ''u'' = ''k&amp;prime;''.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;[[File:Properties_of_a_kernel.svg|200px]]&lt;/div&gt;

Note that in many [[concrete category|concrete]] contexts, one would refer to the object ''K'' as the "kernel", rather than the morphism ''k''.
In those situations, ''K'' would be a [[subset]] of ''X'', and that would be sufficient to reconstruct ''k'' as an [[inclusion map]]; in the nonconcrete case, in contrast, we need the morphism ''k'' to describe ''how'' ''K'' is to be interpreted as a [[subobject]] of ''X''. In any case, one can show that ''k'' is always a [[monomorphism]] (in the categorical sense of the word). One may prefer to think of the kernel as the pair (''K'', ''k'') rather than as simply ''K'' or ''k'' alone.

Not every morphism needs to have a kernel, but if it does, then all its kernels are isomorphic in a strong sense: if ''k'' : ''K'' → ''X'' and {{math|''{{ell}}'' : ''L'' → ''X''}} are kernels of ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', then there exists a unique [[isomorphism]] φ : ''K'' → ''L'' such that {{math|1=''{{ell}}'' ∘ φ = ''k''}}.

==Examples==
Kernels are familiar in many categories from [[abstract algebra]], such as the category of [[group (algebra)|group]]s or the category of (left) [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a fixed [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] (including [[vector space]]s over a fixed [[field (mathematics)|field]]).
To be explicit, if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a [[homomorphism]] in one of these categories, and ''K'' is its [[kernel (algebra)|kernel in the usual algebraic sense]], then ''K'' is a [[subalgebra]] of ''X'' and the inclusion homomorphism from ''K'' to ''X'' is a kernel in the categorical sense.

Note that in the category of [[monoid]]s, category-theoretic kernels exist just as for groups, but these kernels don't carry sufficient information for algebraic purposes.
Therefore, the notion of kernel studied in monoid theory is slightly different (see [[#Relationship to algebraic kernels]] below).

In the [[category of rings]], there are no kernels in the category-theoretic sense; indeed, this category does not even have zero morphisms. 
Nevertheless, there is still a notion of kernel studied in ring theory that corresponds to kernels in the [[category of pseudo-rings]].

In the category of [[pointed space|pointed topological spaces]], if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a continuous pointed map, then the preimage of the distinguished point, ''K'', is a subspace of ''X''.  The inclusion map of ''K'' into ''X'' is the categorical kernel of ''f''.

&lt;!-- ''We have plenty of algebraic examples; now we should give examples of kernels in categories from [[topology]] and [[functional analysis]].'' --&gt;

==Relation to other categorical concepts==
The dual concept to that of kernel is that of [[cokernel]].
That is, the kernel of a morphism is its cokernel in the [[opposite category]], and vice versa.

As mentioned above, a kernel is a type of binary equaliser, or [[difference kernel]].
Conversely, in a [[preadditive category]], every binary equaliser can be constructed as a kernel.
To be specific, the equaliser of the morphisms ''f'' and ''g'' is the kernel of the [[subtraction|difference]] ''g'' &amp;minus; ''f''.
In symbols:
:eq (''f'', ''g'') = ker (''g'' &amp;minus; ''f'').
It is because of this fact that binary equalisers are called "difference kernels", even in non-preadditive categories where morphisms cannot be subtracted.

Every kernel, like any other equaliser, is a [[monomorphism]].
Conversely, a monomorphism is called ''[[normal morphism|normal]]'' if it is the kernel of some morphism.
A category is called ''normal'' if every monomorphism is normal.

[[Abelian categories]], in particular, are always normal.
In this situation, the kernel of the [[cokernel]] of any morphism (which always exists in an abelian category) turns out to be the [[image (category theory)|image]] of that morphism; in symbols:
:im ''f'' = ker coker ''f'' (in an abelian category)
When ''m'' is a monomorphism, it must be its own image; thus, not only are abelian categories normal, so that every monomorphism is a kernel, but we also know ''which'' morphism the monomorphism is a kernel of, to wit, its cokernel.
In symbols:
:''m'' = ker (coker ''m'') (for monomorphisms in an abelian category)

==Relationship to algebraic kernels==
[[Universal algebra]] defines a [[kernel (universal algebra)|notion of kernel]] for homomorphisms between two [[algebraic structure]]s of the same kind.
This concept of kernel measures how far the given homomorphism is from being [[injective]].
There is some overlap between this algebraic notion and the categorical notion of kernel since both generalize the situation of groups and modules mentioned above.
In general, however, the universal-algebraic notion of kernel is more like the category-theoretic concept of [[kernel pair]].
In particular, kernel pairs can be used to interpret kernels in monoid theory or ring theory in category-theoretic terms.

Suárez was found by a group of scouts from the Dutch club [[FC Groningen|Groningen]] when they were in Uruguay to scout another player. As they watched, he won and converted a penalty and scored a "wonder goal" against [[Defensor Sporting|Defensor]]. After watching only that match, the scouts approached Suárez and said they wanted to buy him, and after the season, Groningen paid Nacional €800,000 for him.&lt;ref name="Pearce 1-2"/&gt; Suárez was thrilled to go to Europe because his then girlfriend, and now wife, Sofía Balbi, had moved to [[Barcelona]]; they had maintained a long-distance relationship for a year and he wanted to move closer to her.&lt;ref name="ESPNportrait"/&gt;&lt;ref name="personal bio"/&gt;

Liverpool's manager [[Brendan Rodgers]] defended his player by claiming "it's not his job to own up", while Mansfield manager [[Paul Cox (footballer)|Paul Cox]] said he felt "a little bit gutted" by the "instinctive" handball, but admitted he would have accepted a goal scored like that by one of his players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Luis Suárez: 'It's not his job to own up' says Brendan Rodgers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/06/liverpool-brendan-rodgers-luis-suarez-mansfield |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=19 January 2013 |first=Daniel |last=Taylor |date=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Second biting incident=====
On 21 April 2013, during a 2–2 draw with [[Chelsea F.C|Chelsea]] in a Premier League match at Anfield, Suárez bit [[Branislav Ivanović]]; this was the second time Suárez had bitten an opponent. It was not noticed by the officials, and Suárez scored an equaliser in injury time.&lt;ref name="BranBite"/&gt; The bite prompted [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] to call on the FA to take a hard line with Suárez: the FA charged him with violent conduct and he was fined an undisclosed sum by his club.&lt;ref name="Cameron"/&gt; Contrary to claims from Suárez, Ivanović did not accept an apology.&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite news |title=David Cameron calls on FA to take hard line with Luis Suárez over bite |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/22/luis-suarez-charged-biting-ivanovic |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=7 June 2013 |first=Andy |last=Hunter |date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suárez accepted the violent conduct charge but denied the FA's claim the standard punishment of three matches was clearly insufficient for his offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hunter |first=Andy |title=Luis Suárez says three-match ban is enough for biting Branislav Ivanovic |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/23/luis-suarez-liverpool-fa-bite |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=7 June 2013 |date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-man independent panel appointed by the FA decided on a ten-game ban for Suárez, who did not appeal the ban; the panel criticised Suárez for not appreciating "the seriousness" of the incident when he argued against a long ban. The panel also wanted to send a "strong message that such deplorable behaviours do not have a place in football", while noting that "all players in the higher level of the game are seen as role models, have the duty to act professionally and responsibly, and set the highest example of good conduct to the rest of the game – especially to young players".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Luis Suarez: Panel criticises Liverpool striker's reaction |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22311782 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Suárez was born in [[Salto, Uruguay]], the fourth of seven boys.&lt;ref name="Lyttleton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce 1-1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/lfc-player-profiles/luis-suarez/2011/02/09/luis-suarez-s-rise-from-the-streets-of-montevideo-to-liverpool-fc-hero-part-one-100252-28138725/ |title=Luis Suarez's rise from the streets of Montevideo to Liverpool FC hero – part one |first=James |last=Pearce |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2011 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother, [[Paolo Suárez]], is also a professional footballer, currently playing for [[A.D. Isidro Metapán|Isidro Metapán]] in El Salvador.

Suárez moved with his family to [[Montevideo, Uruguay|Montevideo]] when he was seven, and his parents separated when he was nine.&lt;ref name="Pearce 1-1"/&gt; In Montevideo, he developed his football skills on the streets,&lt;ref name="personal bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce 1-1"/&gt; while also taking up work as a street sweeper.&lt;ref name="ESPNportrait"/&gt; The contrast between his life in Europe and the poverty he left behind has been cited as contributing to his periodic aggression on the field, as well as being a possible explanation for the more forgiving attitudes of the Uruguayan public and press towards such cases, compared to Europe.&lt;ref name="ESPNportrait"/&gt;

[[File:Mural escuela 171 01.jpg|thumb|left|Mural of Suárez on his former school in Montevideo, Uruguay]]
Suárez is of [[Multiracial|mixed race]], with public records indicating his having a [[black people|black]] grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16277126 |title=Liverpool statement on Luis Suarez ban in full |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=20 December 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter of ethnicity was raised in reporting on the [[Luis Suárez#Racial abuse incident|Patrice Evra incident]], where use by his grandmother, Lila Piriz, of "''mi negrito''" as a sobriquet has been offered to explain Suárez's repeated use of "negro" over the two-minute altercation; the FA judged his evidence unreliable ''en route'' to issuing him an eight-match ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/sports/luis-suarez-s-granny-used-to-call-him-mi-negrito-news-news-mc0skdecaig.html |title=Luis Suarez's granny used to call him 'Mi Negrito' |publisher=Sify.com |date=26 February 2012 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez began dating Sofía Balbi at age 15 in Montevideo; the Balbi family moved to [[Barcelona]] in 2003, and Suárez's focus on football strengthened as a result as he wanted to follow them to Europe to join Sofía again.&lt;ref name="ESPNportrait"/&gt; Suárez married her in 2009, and the couple have a daughter and a son.&lt;ref name="Lyttleton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="daughter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/Nieuws-item/184887/Suarez-in-Barcelona-vader-geworden-van-dochter.htm |title=Suarez in Barcelona vader geworden van dochter |publisher=Voetbal International |date=5 August 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2010 |language=Dutch |trans-title=Suarez has a daughter in Barcelona |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806171323/http://www.vi.nl/Nieuws-item/184887/Suarez-in-Barcelona-vader-geworden-van-dochter.htm |archivedate=6 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a tattoo of his daughter’s name Delfina on his wrist which he kisses as part of his [[goal celebration]] – this celebration routine is featured in EA Sports’ video game ''[[FIFA 15]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/luis-suarez-reveals-double-meaning-of-trademark-goal-celebration-8457435.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Luis Suarez reveals double meaning of trademark goal celebration | date=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Watch Samuel Eto'o's old man celebration and more in the FIFA 15 goal celebration tutorial video |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/samuel-eto-o-s-old-man-celebration-and-more-to-be-featured-in-fifa-15-182936039.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |agency=Yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 July 2014, Suárez joined Barcelona, allowing him to live closer with his wife Sofía's family.

The '''DJI''' '''Osmo''' ({{zh|c=灵眸|p=Líng Móu}}; stylized as '''DJI OSMO''') is a [[camcorder]] manufactured by [[DJI (company)|DJI]]. It is capable of shooting [[4K resolution|4K UHD]], and 12-16 [[Pixel|MP]] within a maximum of 64 GB [[Secure Digital|microSD]] storage.

Unlike most camcorders, it incorporates a [[modular design]], as it attaches camera [[gimbal]]s to its base, which it uses to incorporate different file formats, such as [[lossless compression]] and [[Raw image format|RAW format]] with the Zenmuse X5R gimbal. It is [[Backward compatibility|backwards compatible]] with the Inspire 1 [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] Zenmuse gimbal.

== Overview ==
The DJI Osmo is a camcorder, as it is only packaged with its handle, camera gimbal, and case.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2016/07/18/stable-video-through-osmosis/|title=DJI Osmo: Smooth operator|last=Kit Hoong|first=Tan|date=18 July 2016|work=The Star|access-date=26 July 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interface of the camera is controlled through a [[smartphone]] app called "DJI Go",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.droneflyers.com/2016/04/dji-osmo-handheld-stablized-camera-first-look-and-review/|title=DJI Osmo Handheld Stabilized Camera - First Look and Review - DroneFlyers|last=|first=|date=|work=DroneFlyers|publisher=DroneFlyers|access-date=26 July 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is used in certain [[Phantom (UAV)|Phantom]] drones.

==== General ====
The DJI Osmo's handle itself weighs 201g, and the handle is 61.8 x 48.2 x 161.5mm dimensionally. (2.43 x 1.9 x 6.4in)&lt;ref name="Buy Osmo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.dji.com/product/osmo?from=menu_products#/spec|title=Buy Osmo|publisher=[[DJI (company)|DJI]]|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controls are a record button, a [[joystick]], and a trigger in the front. A power slider for turning on and off the camera is located in the right side of the handle. On the left side, a mount can be attached onto the camera.

==== Microphone ====
The camera is equipped with an internal [[microphone]] for audio recording, and a 3.5mm jack placed near the trigger allows external microphones to be plugged in.

==== Camera gimbals ====
The DJI Osmo is compatible with four Zenmuse gimbals: the X3, X3 Zoom, X5, and X5R. The X3, which is packaged, can shoot up to [[4K resolution|4K]] video and take 12[[Pixel|MP]] stills.&lt;ref name="Buy Osmo Gimbal and Camera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.dji.com/product/osmo-gimbal-camera|title=Buy Osmo Gimbal and Camera|publisher=[[DJI (company)|DJI]]|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The X3 Zoom keeps the same X3 sensor but adds 3.5x optical zoom and 2x digital lossless zoom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dji.com/osmo-plus/info#specs|title=Osmo +|last=|first=|date=|website=DJI|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The X5, can shoot 4K at 30[[Frame rate|fps]], and can take 16MP stills.&lt;ref name="Buy Zenmuse X5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.dji.com/product/zenmuse-x5|title=Buy Zenmuse X5|publisher=[[Dji (company)|DJI]]|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The X5R, which is an upgraded version of the X5 gimbal, adds [[lossless compression]] and [[Raw image format|RAW format]] and is intended for professional use.&lt;ref name="Buy Zenmuse X5R"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.dji.com/product/zenmuse-x5r|title=Buy Zenmuse X5R|publisher=[[DJI (company)|DJI]]|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the X5 and X5R require a separate adapter sold independently.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/10/31/dji-osmo-review/|title=DJI Osmo review: A hand-held stabilized camera worthy of its price|last=Lai|first=Richard|date=31 October 2015|work=[[Engadget]]|access-date=26 July 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gimbals, unless locked, are stabilized with three individual motors, keeping footage steady and stabilized without editing after. When not in use, the motors lock automatically, and can be unlocked manually during set-up and initialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/dji-osmo-hands-on-a-4k-cam-for-super-steady-video-no-1735277606|title=DJI Osmo Hands-On: A 4K Cam For Super Steady Video, No Skill Required|last=Hession|first=Michael|date=8 October 2015|work=[[Gizmodo]]|access-date=26 July 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software ===
The DJI Osmo has no internal display, as a [[smartphone]] running either [[Android (operating system)|Android]] or [[iOS]] needs to have the companion app, "DJI Go".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, it can also operate independently, without external connection.

The '''P300''' ('''P3''') wave is an [[event related potential]] (ERP) component elicited in the process of decision making. It is considered to be an [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] potential, as its occurrence links not to the physical attributes of a stimulus, but to a person's reaction to it. More specifically, the P300 is thought to reflect processes involved in stimulus evaluation or categorization.  It is usually elicited using the [[oddball paradigm]], in which low-probability target items are mixed with high-probability non-target (or "standard") items.

When recorded by  [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), it surfaces as a positive deflection in voltage with a latency (delay between stimulus and response) of roughly 250 to 500 ms.&lt;ref name="Polich2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Polich, J.|year=2007|title=Updating P300: An integrative theory of P3a and P3b|journal= Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=118|issue=10|pages=2128–2148|doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2007.04.019|pmc=2715154|pmid=17573239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The signal is typically measured most strongly by the electrodes covering the [[parietal lobe]].  The presence, magnitude, topography and timing of this signal are often used as metrics of [[cognitive function]] in decision making processes. While the neural substrates of this ERP component still remain hazy, the reproducibility and ubiquity of this signal makes it a common choice for psychological tests in both the clinic and laboratory.

== History ==
 
Early observations of the P300 (more specifically, the component that would later be named the P3b) were reported in the mid-1960s.  In 1964, researchers Chapman and Bragdon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chapman, R.M.|author2=Bragdon, H.R.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1964|title=Evoked responses to numerical and non-numerical visual stimuli while problem solving|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=203|pages=1155–1157|pmid=14213667|doi=10.1038/2031155a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   found that ERP responses to [[visual]] stimuli differed depending on whether the stimuli had meaning or not.  They showed subjects two kinds of visual stimuli: numbers and flashes of light.  Subjects viewed these stimuli one at a time in a sequence.   For every two numbers, the subjects were required to make simple decisions, such as telling which of the two numbers was numerically smaller or larger, which came first or second in the sequence, or whether they were equal.  When examining evoked potentials to these stimuli (i.e., ERPs), Chapman and Bragdon found that both the numbers and the flashes elicited the expected sensory responses (e.g., [[visual N1]] components), and that the amplitude of these responses varied in an expected fashion with the intensity of the stimuli.  They also found that the ERP responses to the numbers, but not to the light flashes, contained a large positivity that peaked around 300&amp;nbsp;ms after the stimulus appeared.  Chapman and Bragdon speculated that this differential response to the numbers, which came to be known as the P300 response, resulted from the fact that the numbers were meaningful to the participants, based on the task that they were asked to perform.

In 1965, Sutton and colleagues published results from two experiments that further explored this late positivity.  They presented subjects with either a cue that indicated whether the following stimulus would be a click or a flash, or a cue which required subjects to guess whether the following stimulus would be a click or a flash.  They found that when subjects were required to guess what the following stimulus would be, the amplitude of the "late positive complex"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sutton, S.|author2=Braren, M.|author3=Zubin, J.|author4=John, E.R.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1965|title=Evoked-Potential Correlates of Stimulus Uncertainty|journal=Science|volume=150|issue=3700|pages=1187–1188|pmid=5852977|doi=10.1126/science.150.3700.1187}}&lt;/ref&gt; was larger than when they knew what the stimulus would be.  In a second experiment, they presented two cue types.  For one cue there was a 2 in 3 chance that the following stimulus would be a click and a 1 in 3 chance that the following stimulus would be a flash.  The second cue type had probabilities that were the reverse of the first.  They found that the amplitude of the positive complex was larger in response to the less probable stimuli, or the one that only had a 1 in 3 chance of appearing.  Another important finding from these studies is that this late positive complex was observed for both the clicks and flashes, indicating that the physical type of the stimulus (auditory or visual) did not matter.

In later studies published in 1967, Sutton and colleagues had subjects guess whether they would hear one click or two clicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sutton, S.|author2=Tueting, P.|author3=Zubin, J.|author4=John, E.R.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1967|title=Information delivery and the sensory evoked potential|journal=Science|volume=155|issue=3768|pages=1436–1439|doi=10.1126/science.155.3768.1436|pmid=6018511}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They again observed a positivity around 300&amp;nbsp;ms after the second click occurred – or would have occurred, in the case of the single click.  They also had subjects guess how long the interval between clicks might be, and in this case, the late positivity occurred 300&amp;nbsp;ms after the second click.  This shows two important findings: first, that this late positivity occurred when uncertainty about the type of click was resolved, and second, that even an absence of a stimulus would elicit the late positive complex, if said stimulus was relevant to the task.  These early studies encouraged the use of ERP methods to study cognition and provided a foundation for the extensive work on the P300 in the decades that followed.

== P3a and P3b ==
{{main|P3a|P3b}}
Since the initial discovery of the P300, research has shown that the P300 has two subcomponents. The subcomponents are the novelty P3, or [[P3a]], and the classic P300, which has since been renamed [[P3b]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Squires, N.K.|author2=Squires, K.C.|author3=Hillyard, S.A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1975|title=Two varieties of long-latency positive waves evoked by unpredictable auditory stimuli in man|journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=387–401|pmid=46819|doi=10.1016/0013-4694(75)90263-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The P3a, or novelty P3,&lt;ref name="Comerchero"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0168-5597(98)00033-1 | last1 = Comerchero | first1 = M. D. | last2 = Polich | first2 = J. | year = 1999 | title = P3a and P3b from typical auditory and visual stimuli | url =https://www.sfu.ca/~jmcd/courses/925/papers/Comerchero(1999).pdf | journal = Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 110 | issue = 1| pages = 24–30 | pmid = 10348317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has a positive-going amplitude that displays maximum amplitude over frontal/central electrode sites and has a peak latency in the range of 250-280&amp;nbsp;ms.  The P3a has been associated with [[brain]] activity related to the engagement of [[attention]] (especially the [[orienting response|orienting]], involuntary shifts to changes in the environment), and the processing of novelty.&lt;ref name="fMRI"&gt;{{cite book|author=Polich, J.|year=2003|contribution=Overview of P3a and P3b|editor=J. Polich|title=Detection of Change: Event-Related Potential and fMRI Findings|pages=83–98|publisher=Kluwer Academic Press|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The P3b has a positive-going amplitude (usually relative to a reference behind the ear or the average of two such references) that peaks at around 300&amp;nbsp;ms, and the peak will vary in latency from 250–500&amp;nbsp;ms or more depending upon the task.&lt;ref name="Polich2007" /&gt; Amplitudes are typically highest on the scalp over parietal brain areas.&lt;ref name="Polich2007" /&gt;  The P3b has been a prominent tool used to study cognitive processes, especially psychology research on information processing.  Generally speaking, improbable events will elicit a P3b, and the less probable the event, the larger the P3b amplitude.&lt;ref name="Donchin1981"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Donchin, E.|year=1981|title=Presidential Address, 1980: Surprise!...Surprise?|journal=Psychophysiology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=493–513|pmid=7280146|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x|url=http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/jjbareprints/psyc501a/readings/Donchin_Surprise,%20Surprise_%20Psychofizz_1980.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in order to elicit a P3b, the improbable event must be related to the task at hand in some way (for example, the improbable event could be an infrequent target letter in a stream of letters, to which a subject might respond with a button press).  The P3b can also be used to measure how demanding a task is on [[cognitive load|cognitive workload]].&lt;ref  name="Donchin1981" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Since the mid-1980s, one of the most discussed uses of ERPs such as the P300 is related to [[lie detection]]. In a proposed "guilty knowledge test"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Farwell LA, Smith SS|title=Using brain MERMER testing to detect knowledge despite efforts to conceal|journal=J Forensic Sci|volume=46|issue=1|pages=135–143|date=January 2001|url=http://www.brainwavescience.com/Farwell_Smith_Journal_of_Forensic_Sciences_Brain_Fingerprinting.pdf|pmid=11210899}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subject is interrogated via the oddball paradigm much as they would be in a typical lie-detector situation. This practice has recently enjoyed increased legal permissibility while conventional [[polygraph]]y has seen its use diminish, in part owing to the unconscious and uncontrollable aspects of the P300. The technique relies on reproducible elicitation of the P300 wave, central to the idea of a Memory and Encoding Related Multifaceted Electroencephalographic Response (MERMER) developed by Dr. [[Lawrence Farwell]].

Applications in [[brain computer interface|brain-computer interfacing]] (BCI) have also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Piccione F, Giorgi F, Tonin P|displayauthors=etal|title=P300-based brain computer interface: Reliability and performance in healthy and paralysed participants|journal=Clin Neurophysiol|volume=117|issue=3|pages=531–537|date=March 2006|pmid=16458069|doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2005.07.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "seventeen"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Donchin E, Spencer KM, Wijesinghe R|title=The Mental Prosthesis: Assessing the Speed of a P300-Based Brain–Computer Interface|journal=IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering|volume=8|issue=2|pages=174–179|date=June 2000|doi=10.1109/86.847808}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Nijboer F, Sellers EW, Mellinger J|displayauthors=etal|title=A P300-based brain–computer interface for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|journal=Clin Neurophysiol|volume=119|pages=1909–1916|pmid=18571984|doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2008.03.034|pmc=2853977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/application-of-p300-event-related-potential-in-brain-computer-interface|title=Application of P300 Event-Related Potential in Brain-Computer Interface|last=Haider|first=Ali|last2=Fazel-Rezai|first2=Reza|date=2017|publisher=InTech|language=en|doi=10.5772/intechopen.69309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The P300 has a number of desirable qualities that aid in implementation of such systems. First, the waveform is consistently detectable and is elicited in response to precise stimuli. The P300 waveform can also be evoked in nearly all subjects with little variation in measurement techniques, which may help simplify interface designs and permit greater usability. The speed at which an interface is able to operate depends on how detectable the signal is despite "noise." One negative characteristic of the P300 is that the amplitude of the waveform requires averaging of multiple recordings to isolate the signal. This and other post-recording processing steps determine the overall speed of an interface.&lt;ref name="seventeen" /&gt; The algorithm proposed by Farwell and Donchin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=L. A. Farwell|author2=E. Donchin|lastauthoramp=y|title=Talking off the top of your head: A mental prosthesis utilizing event-related brain potentials|journal=Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol.|volume=70|issue=6|pages=510–523|year=1988|pmid=2461285|doi=10.1016/0013-4694(88)90149-6|url=http://www.brainwavescience.com/pdf/publication/Farwell_Donchin_Talking_Off_the_Top_of_Your_Head_1988_BCI.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an example of a simple BCI that relies on the unconscious decision making processes of the P300 to drive a computer. A 6×6 grid of characters is presented to the subject, and various columns or rows are highlighted. When a column or row contains the character a subject desires to communicate, the P300 response is elicited (since this character is "special" it is the target stimulus described in the typical oddball paradigm). The combination of the row and column which evoked the response locates the desired character. A number of such trials must be averaged to clear noise from the EEG. The speed of the highlighting determines the number of characters processed per minute. Results from studies using this setup show that normal subjects could achieve a 95% success rate at 3.4–4.3 chars/min. Such success rates are not limited to non-disabled users; a study conducted in 2000 revealed that 4 paralyzed participants (one with complete paraplegia, three with incomplete paraplegia) performed as successfully as 10 normal participants.&lt;ref name = "seventeen"/&gt;

Scientific research often relies on measurement of the P300 to examine event related potentials, especially with regard to decision making. Because cognitive impairment is often correlated with modifications in the P300, the waveform can be used as a measure for the efficacy of various treatments on cognitive function. Some have suggested its use as a clinical marker for precisely these reasons. There is a broad range of uses for the P300 in clinical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hansenne M|trans-title=The P300 event-related potential. II.

'''Pariṇāma-vāda''' ({{lang-sa|परिणामवाद}}), or theTransformation theory is that which pre-supposes the cause to be continually transforming itself into its effects, and it has three variations – the Satkarya-vada of the [[Samkhya]]s, the Prakrti Parinama-vada of the [[Saiva Siddhanta]] and the Brahma-Parinama-vada of the [[Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] School of Thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy|author=John A.Grimes|publisher=SUNY Press|page=228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcoUFYOX0bEC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

In Indian philosophy, there are basically three major cosmological theories of origination – 1) Arambha-vada (the theory of atomic agglomeration, based on the theory of Asatkarya-vada that the effect, which is something newly produced, does not exist in the cause), 2) Parinama-vada (the theory of real transformation, based on satkarya-vada that the effect, though phenomenally different, is substantially identical with the cause, and pre-exists latently in it), and 3) [[Vivartavada]] (the theory of apparent transformation or of false appearance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Thousand Teachings: Upadesasahasari of Sankara|author=Sankaracarya|publisher=SUNY Press|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fkLggRFFBwC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qpvPUsnUO8Sq7QaCnYDADA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the fourth, [[Pratityasamutpada|Pratityasamutpada-vada]], the theory of dependent origination of [[Buddhism]].

According to the Sat-Karya-vada of the Samkhya School of [[Vedanta]], also accepted by the [[Vishishtadvaita|Vishishtadvaitavada Vedanta]], causation is the manifestation of what is in the latent condition in the cause. The Prakrti Parnama-vada is based on the premise that the world is a transformation of the primordial Nature or [[Prakrti]]. According to the Brahman Parinama-vada, the world is a transformation of [[Brahman]].
Parināma-vāda is the term that refers to the [[Monotheism|Monotheistic Schools]]’ theory of ‘actual transformation’ different from [[Vivartavada]], the [[Monism|Monistic Schools]]’ theory of apparent transformation. It is the theory that the effect is a real transformation of the cause. According to the Brahman-parinama, this universe is a real transformation of Brahman.

==Arambha-vada==

The Arambha-vada theory of causation is advocated by the [[Nyaya|Nyaya School]], which is the creationistic view of causation and implies new creation as the effect that puts an end to its antecedent nonexistence and marks a new beginning. According to this school the effect, being the counter-entity of its prior nonexistence, must be held to be nonexistent before its appearance as an effect although it arose out of a previously existent cause. This theory is the reverse of Parinama-vada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Traditions of Mysticism in Bengal|author=Sadhu Santideva|publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt. Ltd|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGeitIm_--cC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4aTPUvnHMYqBhAfXsoG4Aw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Arambhavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brahman as the cause==

The general Vedanta view is that Brahman is both, the Material and the Efficient, cause of the entire universe. There is nothing outside the Omnipresent Brahman. Brahman is the only being which contains the elements of cit and a-cit which are transformed into the forms of individual souls and material objects. There is no external world of souls and matter produced out of external material causes, and the very concept of [[Pradhana]] or Primal Matter, outside Brahman, involves contradiction.

==Sat-Karya-vada==

According to this philosophy, which follows from [[Satkaryavada|Sat-Karya-vada]], the cause first, potentially contains the effect in it as its [[Shakti]] (power), in an un-manifest way; then through the instrumentality of the efficient cause, that potential, latent, un-manifest effect is made actual, patent and manifest. Creation is not a new beginning but the manifestation of the already present un-manifest. The world, as the effect arisen from the pure cause, cannot be impure and imperfect because Brahman, the pure essence, merely transforms itself and does not change, and therefore, remains the same always, whereas the effects are mere names, due to words, for knowing and identifying the effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srikanth’s Philosophy of the Monotheistic Vedanta|author=Ruma Chaudhury|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|pages=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvwyXwxelxIC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prakrti]] is orderly. The [[Ṛta]] (order) that makes Prakrti appear to be composed of sub-systems arranged hierarchically with each sub-system being progressively inclusive, co-ordinating and interdependent is traditionally held to be the main basis of the doctrine of pre-existent effect or Sat-Karya-vada or the doctrine of real transformation or Parinama-vada, which R.A.Sinari states is “the earliest and epistemologically the most valuable attempt made in [[Indian Philosophy]] to set up a theory of causal order”. All phenomena, belonging to the surface and/or the deeper structure of Prakrti, are parinama i.e. transformation, of one and the same substratum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Classical Yoga|author=Georg Feuerstein|publisher=Inner Traditions|pages=30–32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuWI9M9WC6MC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]] says: मायां तु प्रकृतिं – “Know Maya to be Prakrti”. But, both the Samkhya School and the [[Brahma Sutra]]s base their understandings of the process of transformation for origination of things on the will of the creator. Badarayana by stating – नासतोऽदृष्टत्वात् | (Brahma Sutra 2.2.26), declares that Existence does not come out of non-existence. The entire creation is the result of Brahman’s will – अभिध्योपदेशाच्च | (Brahma Sutra 1.4.24), and that all transmigratory existence has no beginning - उपपद्यते चाप्युलभ्यते च | (Brahma Sutra 2.1.36).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|author=Gambhirananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=414, 294, 364|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/brahma-sutra-bhasya-of-shankaracharya-IDJ504/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tantra view==

[[Tantra]] has influenced the [[Hindu]], the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and the [[Jainism|Jain]] traditions. According to the Srividya and the Saivite texts, the thirty-six tattvas covering the entire range of the un-manifest and manifest world, from the gross to the most subtle known as siva, pure illumination. Parinama-vada called Sakti parinama-vada, along with the doctrine of [[Abhasavada]] or [[Pratibimbavada]], explains the relationship between samvit or Tripura and the world; Tripura refers to the totality of the three-folds – sthula (gross), suksma (subtle) and para (transcendent), it represents. According to Abhasa-vada, samvit is like a mirror and the universe is a reflection appearing on it. But the universe cannot be outside the mirror i.e. citi or samvit. According to Parinama-vada, citi (consciousness) manifests in the form of the universe without losing its pristine nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sakti – The Power in Tantra|author=Rajmani Tigunait|publisher=Himalayan Press|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XnnFl6ZFHwC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IWHPUoC7IMyThQe6woGgCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vivartavada==

[[Gaudapada]] treats creation as an imaginary event even though it seems to follow a sequential order. [[Badarayana]] also states that creation for Brahman is a mere pastime out of his spontaneity without any extraneous motive. But, Gaudapada, who was aware of the concepts of the real and apparent transformations, develops the doctrine of creation as an illusory transformation of Brahman without recourse to ‘vivarta’ terminology. The followers of Advaita School promoted by [[Adi Sankara]], to whom owing to [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] the world appears as if it is real i.e. distortion or false apprehension of the all encompassing unity of Brahman, use this term ‘vivarta’ to support the principle of the immutability of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism: The Mahayana Context of Gaudapadiya|author=Richard King|publisher=SUNY Press|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3ekXTZMZ_sC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4aTPUvnHMYqBhAfXsoG4Aw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vidyaranya]] reminds us – एकमेवाद्वितीयं सन्नामरूपविवर्जितम् | - that before the creation there existed the Reality, one only, without a second, and without name and form ([[Panchadasi]] 5.5), this after explaining (in verse 2.59) that with Brahman as its basis, Maya creates the various objects of the world, just as a variety of pictures are drawn on a wall by the use of different colours, in other words, “Maya makes it possible for the imagination to attribute different changes to the unchangeable”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pancadasi of Sri Vidyaranya Swami|author=Swami Swahananda|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=59,124|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pancadasi-Swami-Vidyaranya/dp/8171205070}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is, therefore, said that “Maya resembles [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]], the source of common illusions, and described as the principle of cosmic illusion, thus differing from Prakrti of the Samkhyas which is real in the full sense of the term”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt.

==Criticism==
Both, Parnama-vada and Vivartavada, have their own critics. [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhava]] rejects [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhaskara]] on the ground that it is not possible for Brahman to transform at the loss of original nature, and there cannot exist unbridgeable gulf between Cit (Spirit) and Jada (Matter).239 A perfect being of pure intelligence and bliss cannot evolve out of itself an effect that is inert and wholly lacking in intelligence. [[Ramanuja]] accepts the material causality of Brahman which is absolutely without personal modification and which has the transforming Prakrti as its body. Vivarta concept is rejected because Brahman is not the constituent cause of Maya, therefore Brahman cannot be the constituent cause of the world through Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treasury of Mahayana Sutras|author=Garma C.C.Chanpage=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aktdBheKI-IC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x6bPUtvnJ46ihgfY1oCYDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2006}}
A '''''parvenu''''' is a person who is a relative newcomer to a socioeconomic class. The word is borrowed from the [[French language]]; it is the past participle of the verb ''parvenir'' (to reach, to arrive, to manage to do something).

==Origin==
The word ''parvenu'' typically describes a person who recently ascended the social ladder, especially a ''[[nouveau riche]]'' or "new money" individual.  The famous [[Margaret Brown]], who survived the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' sinking in 1912, was portrayed as a "new money" individual in the "climbing social classes" musical ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]'' because of her impoverished [[Irish people|Irish]] [[immigrant]] roots and lack of social [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]].

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines a ''parvenu'' as: "A person from a humble background who has rapidly gained wealth or an influential social position; a nouveau riche; an upstart, a social climber. Also in extended use. Generally used with the implication that the person concerned is unsuited to the new social position, esp. through lacking the necessary manners or accomplishments."

The term designates individuals not socially accepted by individuals already established in their new class. It expresses a form of [[classism]].

==Social climber&lt;!--'Social climber' and 'Arriviste' redirect here--&gt;==
A '''social climber'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is someone who seeks social prominence, for example by obsequious behavior. The term is sometimes used as synonymous with parvenu, and may be used as an insult, suggesting a poor work ethic or disloyalty to roots.

==Examples==

Several examples might include athletic and entertainment professionals born and raised in [[poverty]] and suddenly finding themselves with significantly higher income due to their new-found celebrity status.

Established royal families of Europe regarded the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonaparte]] family as ''parvenu'' royalty. [[Napoleon III]] tried to marry into Swedish and German royalty, but was unsuccessful because he was a ''parvenu''. This was also said to be the case with the marriage of Egyptian [[Princess Fawzia Fuad of Egypt|Princess Fawzia]] to the future [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah of Iran]], [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. One of the reasons speculated for their divorce is that Fawzia's family, including [[King Farouk I]], viewed the Pahlavis as ''parvenus''. Though the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]], to which Fawzia belonged, had humble beginnings, it had solidified its status in Egypt and the [[Arab World]] since 1805. In contrast, the Pahlavis were a far more recent dynasty, owing their position entirely to the ''[[Iranian coup of 1921|coup d'état]]'' of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's father, [[Reza Shah|Reza Khan]], in 1921.

Many ''parvenus'' in the [[United States]] arrived there as poor immigrants, then worked their way up the social ladder. Beginning as laborers, they took advantage of better economic opportunities in the U.S., moving on to become civil servants, [[White-collar worker|"white collar"]] (business/office) workers and finally members of respectable society. Such an example might be [[John Jacob Astor]], whose family once skinned rabbits for a living.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Gustavus [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30956/30956-h/30956-h.htm#CHAPTER_II_II "THE INCEPTION OF THE ASTOR FORTUNE"], ''THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT AMERICAN FORTUNES'', 1907, accessed May 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; With his brother, he went on to build such icons of [[New York City]] as the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. His grandson moved to England, where he eventually became [[William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor|the first Viscount Astor]].

In the 19th century, the French aristocracy viewed Jewish women who converted to Christianity upon marriage as parvenus.&lt;ref name="archivescommentenetre"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicault|first1=Catherine|title=Comment " en être " ? Les Juifs et la Haute Société dans la seconde moitié du xixe siècle|journal=Archives juives|date=2009|volume=1|issue=42|pages=8–32|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-archives-juives-2009-1-page-8.htm|accessdate=June 7, 2016|via=[[Cairn.info]]|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Catherine Nicault of the [[University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne]] has argued that this exemplified the way in which the French aristocracy was hostile toward Jews.&lt;ref name="archivescommentenetre"/&gt;

'''Pirate Party''' is a label adopted by [[political party|political parties]] in different countries. Pirate parties support [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]], [[direct democracy]] ([[e-democracy]]) and [[Participatory democracy|participation in government]], reform of [[copyright]] and [[patent law]], free sharing of knowledge ([[open content]]), [[information privacy]], [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]], [[freedom of information]], [[free speech]], [[Political corruption|anti-corruption]] and [[net neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pp-international.net/about|title=About the PPI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Pirate Party to be established was the [[Pirate Party of Sweden]] ({{lang-sv|Piratpartiet}}), whose website was launched on 1 January 2006 by [[Rick Falkvinge]]. Falkvinge was inspired to found the party after he found that Swedish politicians were generally unresponsive to Sweden's debate over changes to [[copyright law]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=nate&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Nate|title=Political pirates: A history of Sweden's Piratpartiet|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/02/rick-falkvinge-is-the-face/|accessdate=7 August 2015|work=Ars Technica|date=26 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Pirate Party]] was founded on 6 June 2006 by [[University of Georgia]] graduate student Brent Allison. The party's concerns were abolishing the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], reducing the length of copyrights from 95 years after publication or 70 years after the author's death to 14 years, and the expiry of [[patents]] that do not result in significant progress after four years, as opposed to 20 years. However, Allison stepped down as leader three days after founding the party.&lt;ref name=uspp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Downie|first1=James|title=What is the Pirate Party—and why is it helping Wikileaks?|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/world/81963/pirate-party-wikileaks|accessdate=7 August 2015|work=New Republic|date=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pirate Party of Austria]] ({{lang-de|Piratenpartei Österreichs}}) was founded in July 2006 in the run-up to the [[Austrian legislative election, 2006|2006 Austrian legislative election]] by [[Florian Hufsky]] and Jürgen "Juxi" Leitner.&lt;ref name=fuzo&gt;{{cite news|last1=Igler|first1=Nadja|title=Österreichs Piraten sehen grün|url=http://www.fuzo-archiv.at/artikel/137321v2|accessdate=7 August 2015|work=Future Zone|date=19 September 2006|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pirate Party of Finland]] was founded in 2008 and entered the official registry of Finnish political parties in 2009.

The [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European Parliament election]] took place between the 4 and 7 June 2009, and various Pirate Parties stood candidates. The most success was had in [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Sweden)|Sweden]], where the Pirate Party of Sweden won 7.1% of the vote, and had [[Christian Engström]] elected as the first ever Pirate Party [[Member of European Parliament]] (MEP).&lt;ref name=tele09&gt;{{cite news|title=European elections 2009: Sweden's Pirate Party wins a seat in parliament|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/5472520/European-elections-2009-Swedens-Pirate-Party-wins-a-seat-in-parliamentpps.html|accessdate=7 August 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=8 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guard09&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Chris|title=Sweden's Pirate party sails to success in European elections|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jun/11/pirate-party-sweden|accessdate=7 August 2015|work=The Guardian|date=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the introduction of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], the Pirate Party of Sweden were afforded another MEP in 2011, that being [[Amelia Andersdotter]].

The [[European Parliament election, 2014|2014 European Parliament election]] took place between the 22 and 24 May. [[Julia Reda]] was at the top of the list for [[Pirate Party Germany]], and was subsequently elected as the party received 1.45% of the vote. Other notable results include the [[Czech Pirate Party]], who received 4.78% of the vote, meaning they were 0.22% off getting elected, the [[Pirate Party of Luxembourg]], who received 4.23% of the vote, and the [[Pirate Party of Sweden]], who received 2.19% of the vote, but lost both their MEPs.&lt;ref name=piratevotes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Collentine|first1=Josef Ohlsson|title=All Pirate Party votes in the EU election|url=http://piratetimes.net/all-pirate-party-votes-in-the-eu-election-800-000-votes/|accessdate=8 August 2015|work=Pirate Times|date=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Icelandic Pirate Party was leading the national polls in March 2015, with 23.9%. The Independence Party polled 23.4%, only 0.5% behind the Pirate Party. According to the poll, the Pirate Party would win 16 seats in the [[Althing]].&lt;ref name=hudson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hudson|first1=Alex|title=The Pirates becomes the most popular political party in Iceland|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/pirates-becomes-most-popular-political-5364061|accessdate=7 August 2015|work=Mirror|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=icebig&gt;{{cite news|title=The Pirate Party is now measured as the biggest political party in Iceland|url=http://www.visir.is/the-pirate-party-is-now-measured-as-the-biggest-political-party-in-iceland/article/2015150318848|accessdate=7 August 2015|work=Vísir|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, in the wake of the [[Panama Papers]] scandal, polls showed the Icelandic Pirate Party at 43% and the Independence Party at 21.6%,&lt;ref name="Björnsson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Björnsson|first1=Anna Margrét|title=Almost half of Icelandic nation now want the Pirate Party|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/04/06/almost_half_of_icelandic_nation_now_want_the_pirate/|accessdate=6 April 2016|work=Iceland Monitor|date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Pirate Party eventually won 15% of the vote in the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2016|29 October 2016 parliamentary election]].

In April 2017, a group of students at [[University of California, Berkeley]] formed a Pirate Party to participate in the [[Associated Students of the University of California]] senate elections, winning the only third-party seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2017/04/14/executive-seats-split-calserve-student-action-2017-asuc-elections/|title=Executive seats split between CalSERVE, Student Action in 2017 ASUC elections|last=Andrea Platten {{!}} Senior Staff|date=2017-04-14|website=The Daily Californian|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Czech Pirate Party]]  entered the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] of the Czech Parliament for the first time after the [[Czech legislative election, 2017|election]] held on 20 and 21 October 2017 with 10.79%.

[[Czech Pirate Party]], after finishing at the second place at the [[Prague municipal election, 2018]], held on 5 and 6 of October 2018, with 17.1%, formed a coallition with [[Prague Toghether]] and [[United Forces for Prague]] ([[TOP 09]], [[Mayors and Independents]], [[KDU-ČSL]], [[Liberal-Environmental Party]] and [[SNK European Democrats]]). The representant of the [[Czech Pirate Party]], [[Zdeněk Hřib]], was selected as a [[Mayor of Prague]]. It is probably for the first time, when any pirate party has a mayor in one of the major cities of the world.

===Pirate Parties International===
{{Main|Pirate Parties International}}
Pirate Parties International (PPI) is the umbrella organization of the national Pirate Parties. Since 2006, the organization has existed as a loose union&lt;ref name=ppiwiki&gt;[http://int.piratenpartei.de/Pirate_Parties_International Pirate Parties International] in the wiki of Pirate Parties International, retrieved 2011-01-21&lt;/ref&gt; of the national parties. Since October 2009, Pirate Parties International has had the status of a [[non-governmental organization]] (Feitelijke vereniging) based in [[Belgium]]. The organization was officially founded at a conference from 16 to 18 April 2010 in [[Brussels]], when the organization's statutes were adopted by the 22 national pirate parties represented at the event.&lt;ref name='ppint_node471'&gt;{{cite news|title = 22 Pirate Parties from all over the world officially founded the Pirate Parties International|date = 2010-04-21|url = http://pp-international.net/node/471|work = [[Pirate Parties International]]|accessdate = 2012-04-05|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120304230536/http://www.pp-international.net/node/471|archivedate = 4 March 2012|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Pirate Party===
{{Main|European Pirate Party}}
The '''European Pirate Party''' ('''PPEU''') is a [[European political party]] founded in March 2014 which consists of various pirate parties within European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://piratetimes.net/here-comes-the-european-pirate-party/|title=Here comes the European Pirate Party|work=PirateTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pirates without Borders===
Pirates Without Borders is an international association of pirates. Unlike Pirate Parties International (which accepts only parties as voting members and organizations as observing members), Pirates Without Borders accept individuals as members. The PWB see themselves as a basis for international projects. Through global cooperation, they strive to reveal the impact of multinational trade agreements on all people on Earth, and foster freedom and democracy.&lt;ref name='pwb_wiki'&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wiki.pirates-without-borders.org/Main_Page|title = Pirates without Borders Wiki|accessdate = 2012-04-05|publisher = Pirates without Borders}}&lt;/ref&gt; PWB originates from an independent committee for the coordination of Pirate parties in German-speaking countries, known as DACHLuke (DACHL = Germany-Austria-Switzerland-Luxembourg).

Since the Pirate Parties International Conference 2011 on 12 and 13 March 2011, PWB is an "observing member" of Pirate Parties International. The previously independent project "pirate streaming" has become a part of Pirates without Borders since 3 May 2011.

===Parti Pirate Francophone===
In Parti Pirate Francophone, the French-speaking Pirate Parties are organized. Current members are the pirates parties in Belgium, Côte d'Ivoire, France, Canada, and Switzerland. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Part 1: Regulation of biometric data==

Chapter 1 makes provision in respect of the destruction, retention, and use of fingerprints, footwear impressions and DNA samples. In addition it covers profiles taken in the course of a criminal investigation. Under the new scheme provided for in this Chapter, the fingerprints and DNA profiles taken from persons arrested for or charged with a minor offence will be destroyed following either acquittal or a decision not to charge.

This Part amends or omits Sections from the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] and [[Crime and Security Act 2010]] relating to the retention of fingerprints.

*Section 20 of Chapter 1 instructs the Secretary of State to appoint a Commissioner, to be known as the [[Commissioner for the Retention and Use of Biometric Material]], to review the use and retention of biometrics by the government
*Section 24 of Chapter 1 instructs the Secretary of State to make arrangements for a "National DNA Database Strategy Board" to oversee the operation of a DNA database.
* Chapter 2 requires schools and colleges to obtain consent of one parent of a child under 18 for acquiring and processing the child's biometric information and gives the child rights to stop the processing of their biometric information regardless of any parental consent. It also states that processing of biometric information it must be discontinued if any parent of the child objects.

==Part 2: Regulation of surveillance==
{{See also|Automatic number plate recognition in the United Kingdom}}

Chapter 1 creates new regulation for, and instructs the Secretary of State to prepare a code of practice towards [[closed-circuit television]] and [[automatic number plate recognition]]. Chapter 2 amends the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]].

==Part 3: Protection of property from disproportionate enforcement action==

Chapter 1 reforms and repeals aspects of the powers to enter land and to review existing powers of entry legislation. It would implement restrictions as to the premises over which the power may be exercised, who can exercise them, and which conditions can be satisfied for them to be exercised.

Chapter 2 makes it a criminal offence for a private person on private or public land to immobilise a vehicle (e.g. by [[wheel clamp|clamping]] or obstructing), or to move a vehicle, with a view to denying the owner access to it. Section 99 of the [[Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984]] is amended to extend and amend the powers of public authorities to move vehicles parked obstructively, illegally, or dangerously, including on private land. However, clamping is still permitted where an Act of Parliament or byelaw permits the practice, such as the Railway Byelaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/railway-byelaws/railway-byelaws.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816202559/http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/railway-byelaws/railway-byelaws.pdf |archivedate=16 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clamping of vehicles and provisions relating to charging registered keepers of vehicles where a contract has been entered into with landowners or their agents is dealt with by Clauses 54-56 and Schedule 4 of the Act. These would have the effect of making it possible for private landowners and their agents to attempt to recover unpaid parking charges on private land (providing certain conditions are met) from the registered keeper of a vehicle in cases where it is not known who was driving at the time of the parking charge notice being issued. Paragraph 3 defines "relevant land" as excluding highways maintainable at the public expense (within the meaning of section 329(1) of the Highways Act 1980). Under the original wording of the Bill as introduced, clamping would be unlawful on private car-parks unless entrances are barriered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obiterj.blogspot.com/2011/02/vehicle-immobilisation-clamping.html Vehicle immobilisation (clamping) ...

==Part 4: Counter-terrorism powers==

Clause 57 reduces the pre-detention of terrorist suspects to a maximum of 14 days.

This Part removes the 'stop and search' regulations of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]] and reforms the operation of the power to search people and vehicles, in addition to creating new Code of Practice rules in respect of these powers.

==Part 5: Safeguarding vulnerable groups, criminal records etc.==
{{outdated section|reason= Seems to have been written before Royal Assent, refers to the Bill rather than the Act.|date=September 2015}}
*Chapters 1 and 2 amend the [[Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006]] and [[Police Act 1997]] with regards to carers and criminal record checks. The Bill also proposes removing the Controlled Activity and Monitoring sections from the Safeguarding of Vulnerable Groups Act.
* Chapter 3 creates a new [[body corporate]] to be known as the [[Disclosure and Barring Service]], which merges the functions of the [[Independent Safeguarding Authority]] and [[Criminal Records Bureau]].
* Chapter 4 allows people to apply for the Secretary of State to disregard criminal convictions for homosexual acts by consenting adults under section 12 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]], or the "gross indecency between men" section of that Act. Clause 96 confirms that the effect of a successful application would ensure the person is considered as having not committed, nor been charged, prosecuted or convicted of a homosexual act.

==Part 6: Freedom of information and data protection==

* This part extends the existing [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]], extending the scope of the Act and amending the role of the [[Information Commissioner]]. This includes widening the rules on applying for and receiving datasets from public authorities for re-use.

==Part 7: Miscellaneous and general==

* Section 113 repealed section 43 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] which makes provision for trials on indictment to be conducted without a jury in certain fraud cases. Sections 44-50 of that Act, which make provision for trials on indictment to be conducted without a jury where there is a danger of jury tampering, were not affected.
* Section 114 repealed the restrictions that prohibit solemnizing marriages and civil partnerships during evenings and at night. Since the [[Marriage Act 1836]] it had been forbidden to marry between the hours of six in the evening and eight in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12439232 |title=Night-time weddings to be allowed |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]] |date=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns''' ({{lang-fr|querelle des Anciens et des Modernes}}) began overtly as a [[literature|literary]] and artistic debate that heated up in the early 17th century and shook the [[Académie française]].

==Origins of the debate==
It was an essential feature of the European Renaissance to praise recent discoveries and achievements as a means to assert the independence of modern culture from the institutions and wisdom inherited from Classical (Greek and Roman) authorities. From the first years of the sixteenth century, one of the major reasonings used to this end by the most eminent [[Humanism|humanists]] ([[François Rabelais]], [[Girolamo Cardano]], [[Jean Bodin]], [[Louis LeRoy]], [[Tommaso Campanella]], [[Francis Bacon]], etc.) was that of the "Three Greatest Inventions of Modern Times" – the printing press, firearms, and the nautical compass – which together allowed the Moderns to communicate, exert power, and travel at distances never imagined by the Ancients.&lt;ref&gt;Boruchoff, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; When the quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns later arose in France, the "Three Greatest Inventions of Modern Times" would almost invariably be adduced as evidence of the Moderns' superiority.

The debate became known as 'a quarrel' after the frequently made [[pun]] on [[Charles Perrault]]'s title ''Parallel of the Ancients and the Moderns'', the French word 'querelle' being substituted for 'parallele'.

==Debate in France==
On one side of the debate were the Ancients (''Anciens''), led by [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]. The Ancients supported the merits of the ancient authors, and contended that a writer could do no better than imitate them. On the other side were the Moderns (''Modernes''), who opened fire first with [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s ''Le siècle de Louis le Grand'' ("The Century of Louis the Great," 1687), in which he supported the merits of the authors of the century of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and expressed the Moderns' stance in a nutshell:

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
::''La docte Antiquité dans toute sa durée
::''A l'égal de nos jours ne fut point éclairée.''
{{col-break}}
Learned [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], through all its extent, &lt;br /&gt;Was never [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]] to equal our times.&lt;ref&gt;Perrault's poem was published in 1687 in [[François de Callières]]'s ''Histoire poetique de la guerre nouvellement declarée entre les anciens et les modernes'' ("Poetic history of the war recently declared between the ancients and the moderns"),  which was not itself strictly partisan of one side or the other..&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-end}}

[[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]] quickly followed with his ''Digression sur les anciens et les modernes'' (1688), in which he took the Modern side, pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge.

In the opening years of the next century, [[Marivaux]] was to show himself a Modern by establishing a new genre of theatre, unknown to the Ancients, the sentimental comedy (''[[comédie larmoyante]]''). In it the impending tragedy was resolved at the end, amid reconciliations and floods of tears. By constraining his choice of subjects to those drawn from the literature of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], [[Jean Racine]] showed himself one of the Ancients. He also restricted his tragedies by the [[classical unities]], derived by the [[classicism|classicists]] from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'': the unities of place, time, and action (one scene location, 24 hours, and consistent actions respectively).

==Assessment==
The Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns was a cover, often a witty one, for deeper opposed views. The very idea of Progress was under attack on the one side, and [[Authority]] on the other.  The new [[Antiquary|antiquarian interests]] led to critical reassessment of the products of Antiquity that would eventually bring Scripture itself under the magnifying glass of some Moderns.  The attack on authority in literary criticism had analogues in the rise of scientific inquiry, and the Moderns' challenge to authority in literature foreshadowed a later extension of challenging inquiry in systems of politics and religion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Analogous 17th–20th century debates==
In the 17th century, [[William Temple (British politician)|Sir William Temple]] argued against the Modern position in his essay ''On Ancient and Modern Learning''; therein he repeated the [[literary topos|commonplace]], originally from [[Bernard of Chartres]], that we see more only because we are dwarves [[standing on the shoulders of giants]].   Temple's essay prompted a small flurry of responses. Among others, two men who took the side opposing Temple were classicist and editor [[Richard Bentley]] and critic [[William Wotton]].

The entire discussion in England was over by 1696, but it was revisited by [[Jonathan Swift]], who saw in the opposing camps of Ancients and Moderns a shorthand of two general orientations or ways of life. He articulated his discussion most notably in his [[satire]] ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'', composed between 1694 and 1697 and published in 1704 with the famous prolegomenon ''[[The Battle of the Books]]'', long after the initial salvoes were over in France. Swift's polarizing satire provided a framework for other satirists in his circle of the [[Scriblerus Club|Scriblerian]]s.

Two other distinguished 18th-century philosophers who wrote at length concerning the distinction between moderns and ancients are [[Giambattista Vico]] (cf. e.g. his ''[[De nostri temporis studiorum ratione]]'') and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (for whom the moderns see 'more,' but the ancients see 'better').

In 19th-century England, highlighting the distinction between Hellenism ("Athens"/reason or "sweetness and light") and Hebraism ("Jerusalem"/faith), [[Matthew Arnold]] defended the ancients (most notably Plato and Aristotle) against the dominant progressive intellectual trends of his times.  Arnold drew attention to the fact that the great divide between ancients and modernists pertained to the understanding of the relation between liberty/reason and authority.

Countering the thrust of much of 20th-century intellectual history and literary criticism, [[Leo Strauss]] has contended that the debate between ancients and moderns (or the defenders of either camp) is ill understood when reduced to questions of progress or regress.  Strauss himself revived the old "querelle," siding with the ancients (against the modernist position advocated, e.g., by Strauss's friend [[Alexandre Kojève]]).{{cn|date=April 2015}}

'''Redshift-space distortions''' are an effect in [[observational cosmology]] where the spatial distribution of galaxies appears squashed and distorted when their positions are plotted in redshift-space (i.e. as a function of their [[redshift]]) rather than in real-space (as a function of their actual distance). The effect is due to the [[Peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]] of the galaxies causing a [[Doppler shift]] in addition to the redshift caused by the [[Expansion of space|cosmological expansion]].

Redshift-space distortions (RSDs) manifest in two particular ways. The '''Fingers of God''' effect is where the galaxy distribution is elongated in redshift space, with an axis of elongation pointed toward the observer.&lt;ref name="Jackson 1972"&gt;Jackson, J.C. (1972).  "A critique of Rees's theory of primordial gravitational radiation".  ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'', 156, 1P-6P.&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by a Doppler shift associated with the random peculiar velocities of galaxies bound in structures such as clusters. The large velocities that lead to this effect are associated with the [[gravity]] of the cluster by means of the [[virial theorem]]; they change the observed redshifts of the galaxies in the cluster. The deviation from the [[Hubble's law]] relationship between distance and redshift is altered, and this leads to inaccurate distance measurements.

Another, closely related effect is the '''Kaiser effect'''.&lt;ref name="Kaiser 1987"&gt;Kaiser, N. (1987).  "Clustering in real space and in redshift space".  ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'', 227, 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt; This time, the distortion is caused by the coherent motions of galaxies as they fall inwards towards the cluster center as the cluster assembles. Depending on the particular dynamics of the situation, the Kaiser effect usually leads not to an elongation, but an apparent flattening ("pancakes of God"), of the structure. It is a much smaller effect than the fingers of God, and can be distinguished by the fact that it occurs on larger scales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astron.berkeley.edu/~louis/astro228/redshift.html Cosmology Presentation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous effects are a result of special relativity, and have been observed in real data. There are additional effects that come directly from general relativity. One is called '''gravitational redshift distortion'''.&lt;ref name="McDonald 2009"&gt;McDonald, P. (2009). "Gravitational redshift and other redshift-space distortions of the imaginary part of the power spectrum"  ''Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Gravitational redshift distortion comes about from the net [[gravitational redshift]], or blueshift, that is acquired when the photon climbs out of the gravitational potential well of the distant galaxy and then falls into the potential well of the Milky Way galaxy. This effect will make galaxies at a higher gravitational potential than Earth appear slightly closer (generically: less massive galaxies), and galaxies at lower potential will appear farther away (more massive galaxies and near [[galaxy cluster]]s).

The other effects of general relativity on clustering statistics are observed when the light from a background galaxy passes near, or through, a closer galaxy or cluster. These two effects go by the names '''integrated [[Sachs-Wolfe effect]]''' (ISW) and '''[[gravitational lens]]ing'''.&lt;ref name="Yoo 2009"&gt;Yoo, J. (2009). "Complete treatment of galaxy two-point statistics: Gravitational lensing effects and redshift-space distortions"  ''Physical Review D'', 79, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For ISW, when a photon passes through a low area of gravitational potential it is 'protected' from the cosmological expansion of space, making the background galaxy appear closer. Gravitational lensing, unlike all of the previous effects, distorts the apparent position, and number, of background galaxies.

The RSDs measured in [[Redshift survey|galaxy redshift surveys]] can be used as a cosmological probe in their own right, providing information on how structure formed in the Universe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Percival|first1=Will J.|last2=White|first2=Martin|title=Testing cosmological structure formation using redshift-space distortions|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=11 February 2009|volume=393|issue=1|pages=297–308|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.14211.x|arxiv = 0808.0003 |bibcode = 2009MNRAS.393..297P }}&lt;/ref&gt; and how gravity behaves on large scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raccanelli|first1=A.|last2=Bertacca|first2=D.|last3=Pietrobon|first3=D.|last4=Schmidt|first4=F.|last5=Samushia|first5=L.|last6=Bartolo|first6=N.|last7=Dore|first7=O.|last8=Matarrese|first8=S.|last9=Percival|first9=W.

'''Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals''' ('''REACH''') is a [[European Union regulation]] dating from 18 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Full title: Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; REACH addresses the production and use of [[chemical substance]]s, and their potential impacts on both human health and the environment.  Its 849 pages took seven years to pass, and it has been described as the most complex legislation in the Union's history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=EU's REACH chemicals law begins life in Helsinki | date=31 May 2007 | publisher=EUobserver.com | url=http://euobserver.com/9/24169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most important in 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Q&amp;A: Reach chemicals legislation | date=28 November 2005 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4437304.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the strictest law to date regulating chemical substances and will affect industries throughout the world.&lt;ref name="US affected"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/14/MNGR2MV8UT1.DTL&amp;hw=toxic+chemicals&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 | title=European Parliament OKs world's toughest law on toxic chemicals | date=14 December 2006 | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Marla | last=Cone}}&lt;/ref&gt; REACH entered into force on 1 June 2007, with a phased implementation over the next decade. The regulation also established the [[European Chemicals Agency]], which manages the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of REACH.

==Overview==
[[File:European Chemicals Agency.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|[[European Chemicals Agency]] headquarters in {{ill|Annankatu (Helsinki)|fi}}.]]

When REACH is fully in force, it will require all companies manufacturing or importing chemical substances into the European Union in quantities of one [[tonne]] or more per year to register these substances with a new [[European Chemicals Agency]] (ECHA) in {{ill|Annankatu (Helsinki)|fi}}, [[Finland]]. Since REACH applies to some substances that are contained in objects (''articles'' in REACH terminology), any company importing goods into Europe could be affected.&lt;ref name="US affected"/&gt;

The [[European Chemicals Agency]] has set three major deadlines for registration of chemicals. In general these are determined by tonnage manufactured or imported, with 1000 tonnes/a. being required to be registered by 1 December 2010, 100 tonnes/a. by 1 June 2013 and 1 tonne/a. by 1 June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reagent.co.uk/blog/what-is-reach/|title=What is REACH? – ReAgent Chemical Services|date=6 February 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, chemicals of higher concern or toxicity also have to meet the 2010 deadline.

About 143,000 chemical substances marketed in the European Union were pre-registered by the 1 December 2008 deadline. Although pre-registering was not mandatory, it allows potential registrants much more time before they have to fully register. Supply of substances to the European market which have not been pre-registered or registered is illegal (known in REACH as "no data, no market").

REACH also addresses the continued use of chemical ''[[substance of very high concern|substances of very high concern]]'' (SVHC) because of their potential negative impacts on human health or the environment. From 1 June 2011, the European Chemicals Agency must be notified of the presence of SVHCs in articles if the total quantity used is more than one tonne per year and the SVHC is present at more than 0.1% of the mass of the object. Some uses of SVHCs may be subject to prior authorisation from the European Chemicals Agency, and applicants for authorisation will have to include plans to replace the use of the SVHC with a safer alternative (or, if no safer alternative exists, the applicant must work to find one) - known as ''substitution''. {{As of|2015|06|15}}, there are 168 SVHCs on the candidate list for authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

REACH applies to all [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] imported or produced in the EU. The European Chemicals Agency will manage the technical, [[Science|scientific]] and administrative aspects of the REACH system.

To somewhat simplify the registration of the 143,000 substances and to limit vertebrate animal testing as far as possible, substance information exchange forums (SIEFs) are formed amongst legal entities (such as manufacturers, importers, and data holders) who are dealing with the same substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://echa.europa.eu/sief_en.asp |title=Substance Information Exchange Fora&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher=[[European Chemicals Agency]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223062045/http://echa.europa.eu/sief_en.asp |archivedate=2009-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows them to join forces and finances to create 1 registration dossier. However, this creates a series of new problems as a SIEF is the cooperation between sometimes a thousand legal entities that did not know each other at all before but suddenly must:
*find each other and start communicating openly and honestly
*start sharing data
*start sharing costs in a fair and transparent way
*democratically and in full consensus take the most complex decisions
in order to complete a several thousand end points dossier in a limited time.

The [[European Commission]] supports businesses affected by REACH by handing out &amp;ndash; free of charge &amp;ndash; a software application ([[IUCLID]]) that simplifies capturing, managing, and submitting data on chemical properties and effects. Such submission is a mandatory part of the [[REACh authorisation procedure|registration process]]. Under certain circumstances the performance of a [[chemical safety assessment]] (CSA) is mandatory and a [[chemical safety report]] (CSR) assuring the safe use of the substance has to be submitted with the dossier. Dossier submission is done using the web-based software [[REACH-IT]].

The aim of REACH is to improve the protection of human health and the environment by identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances. At the same time, innovative capability and competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry should be enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reach|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|website = TEPPFA|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The European Commission’s (EC) White Paper of 2001 on a ‘future chemical strategy’ proposed a system that requires chemicals manufactured in quantities of greater than 1 tonne to be ‘registered’, those manufactured in quantities greater than 100 tonnes to be ‘evaluated’, and certain substances of high concern (for example carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic to reproduction - CMR’s) to be ‘authorised’.

The EC adopted its proposal for a new scheme to manage the manufacture, importation and supply of chemicals in Europe on in October 2003. This proposal eventually became law once the European Parliament officially approved its final text of REACH. It came into force on 1 June 2007.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
One of the major elements of the REACH [[regulation]] is the requirement to communicate information on [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] up and down the [[supply chain]]. This ensures that manufacturers, importers, and also their customers are aware of information relating to [[health]] and [[safety]] of the products supplied. For many [[retail]]ers the obligation to provide information about [[Chemical substance|substance]]s in their products within 45 days of receipt of a request from a [[consumer]] is particularly challenging. Having detailed information on the substances present in their products will allow retailers to work with the manufacturing base to substitute or remove potentially harmful substances from products. The list of harmful substances is continuously growing and requires [[organization]]s to constantly monitor any announcements and additions to the REACH scope. This can be done on the [[European Chemicals Agency]]'s website.

===Registration===
A requirement is to collect, collate and submit data to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the hazardous properties of all substances (except Polymers and non-isolated intermediates) manufactured or imported into the EU in quantities above 1 tonne per year. Certain substances of high concern, such as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductive toxic substances (CMRs) will have to be authorised.

Chemicals will be registered in three phases according to the tonnage of the substance evaluation:

More than 1000 tonnes a year, or substances of highest concern, must be registered in the first 3 years;

100-1000 tonnes a year must be registered in the first 6 years;

1-100 tonnes a year must be registered in the first 11 years.

In addition, industry should prepare risk assessments and provide controls measures for using the substance safely to downstream users.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"/&gt;

===Evaluation===
Evaluation provides a means for the authorities to require registrants, and in very limited cases downstream users, to provide further information.

There are two types of evaluation: dossier evaluation and substance :

Dossier evaluation is conducted by authorities to examine proposals for testing to ensure that unnecessary animal tests and costs are avoided, and to check the compliance of registration dossier with the registration requirements.

The relevant authorities perform substance evaluation when there is a reason to suspect that a substance presents a risk to human health or the environment (e.g. because of its structural similarity to another substance). Therefore, all registration dossiers submitted for a substance are examined together and any other available information is taken into account.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"/&gt;

===Authorisation===
{{main|REACH authorisation procedure}}
The REACH proposal sets up a system under which the use of substances with properties of very high concern and their placing on the market can be made subject to an authorisation requirement.

This authorisation requirement ensures that risks from the use of such substances are either adequately controlled or justified by socio-economic grounds, having taken into account the available information on alternative substances or processes.

The Regulation enables restrictions of use to be introduced across the European Community where this is shown to be necessary. Member States or the Commission may prepare such proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = www.teppfa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information exchange===
[[File:REACh Dates.png|{{largethumb}}|REACh Key Dates]]

Manufactures and/or importers should develop risk reduction measures for all known uses of the chemical including downstream uses. Downstream users such as plastic pipe producers should provide detail of their uses to their suppliers. In cases where downstream users decide not to disclose this information, they need to have their own CSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = TEPPFA, The Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
REACH is the product of a wide-ranging overhaul of EU chemical policy.  It passed the first reading in the [[European Parliament]] on 17 November 2005, and the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] reached a political agreement for a common position on 13 December 2005. The European Parliament approved REACH on 13 December 2006 and the Council of Ministers formally adopted it on 18 December 2006. Weighing up expenditure versus profit has always been a significant issue, with the estimated cost of compliance being around €5&amp;nbsp;billion over 11&amp;nbsp;years, and the assumed health benefits of saved billions of euro in healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=EU backs landmark chemicals law | date=13 December 2005 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4524772.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been different studies on the estimated cost which vary considerably in the outcome. It came into force on 20 January 2009, and will be fully implemented by 2015.

A separate regulation – the [[CLP Regulation]] (for "Classification, Labelling, Packaging") – implements the United Nations [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS) and will steadily replace the previous [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|Dangerous Substances Directive]] and [[Dangerous Preparations Directive]].

The REACH regulation was amended in April 2018 to include specific information requirements for [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euon.echa.europa.eu/view-article/-/journal_content/title/improved-clarity-on-nanomaterials-in-the-eu-member-states-vote-to-amend-reach-annex-1|title=Improved clarity on nanomaterials in the EU - Member States vote to amend REACH Annexes|last=|first=|date=|publisher=The European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The legislation was proposed under dual reasoning: protection of [[health|human health]] and protection of [[natural environment|the environment]].

Using potentially [[toxic substances]] (such as [[phthalate]]s or [[brominated flame retardant]]s) is deemed undesirable and REACH will force the use of certain substances to be phased out. Using potentially toxic substances in products other than those [[ingest]]ed by humans (such as [[electronic device]]s) may seem to be safe, but there are several ways in which chemicals can enter the human body and the environment. Substances can leave particles during [[consumer]] use, for example into the air where they can be inhaled or ingested. Even where they might not do direct harm to humans, they can contaminate the air or water, and can enter the food chain through plants, fish or other animals. According to the European Commission, little safety information exists for 99 percent of the tens of thousands of chemicals placed on the market before 1981.&lt;ref name="US affected"/&gt; There were 100,106 chemicals in use in the EU in 1981, when the last survey was performed. Of these only 3,000 have been tested and over 800 are known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. These are listed in the Annex 1 of the [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|Dangerous Substances Directive]] (now Annex VI of the [[CLP Regulation]]).

Continued use of many toxic chemicals is sometimes justified because "at very low levels they are not a concern to health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Pesticides 'in a third of foods' | date=27 September 2006 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5384138.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these substances may [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in the human body, thus reaching dangerous concentrations. They may also [[chemical reaction|chemically react]] with one another,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Food chemicals 'may harm humans' | date=21 September 2006 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5366028.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing new substances with new risks.

==In non-EU countries==
A number of countries outside of the European Union have started to implement REACH-regulations or are in the process of adopting such a regulatory framework to approach a more globalized system of chemicals registration under the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130708194823/http://www.icis.com/Articles/2010/05/31/9362538/reach-like+regulations+enacted+globally.html ICIS.com REACH-like regulations enacted globally] retrieved July 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Balkan countries such as [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] are in the process of adopting the EU REACH system under the auspices of the EU IPA programme. [[Switzerland]] has moved towards implementation of REACH through partial revision of the Swiss Chemical Ordinance on February 1, 2009.  The new Chemicals Management Regulation in [[Turkey]] is paving the way for the planned adoption of REACH in 2013. [[China]] has moved towards a more efficient and coherent system for the control of chemicals in compliance with GHS.

==Controversy==
Apart from the potential costs to [[industry]] and the complexity of the new law, REACH has also attracted concern because of [[animal testing]]. Animal tests on [[vertebrate]]s are now required but allowed only once per each new substance and if suitable alternatives cannot be used.  If a company pays for such tests, it must sell the rights of the results for a "reasonable" price, which is not defined.  There are additional concerns that access to the necessary information may prove very costly for potential registrants needing to purchase it.

An opinion in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2009 by Thomas Hartung and Constanza Rovida estimated that 54 million vertebrate animals would be used under REACH and that the costs would amount to €9.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;T. Hartung &amp; C. Rovida: Chemical regulators have overreached. Opinion in Nature, vol. 460, 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hartung is the former head of European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In a news release, ECHA criticised assumptions made by Hartung and Rovida; ECHA's alternative assumptions reduced sixfold the number of animals.&lt;ref&gt;ECHA - [http://echa.europa.eu/doc/press/pr_09_11_animal_testing_20090828.pdf New study inaccurate on the number of test animals for REACH] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215231108/http://echa.europa.eu/doc/press/pr_09_11_animal_testing_20090828.pdf |date=2010-02-15 }}. Helsinki, 28 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

On 8 June 2006, the REACH proposal was criticized by non-EU countries, including the United States, India and [[Brazil]], which stated that the bill would hamper global trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Beunderman | title=EU chemicals bill under fire from US-led coalition | date=June 9, 2006 | publisher=EUobserver.com | url=http://euobserver.com/9/21813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Only representative services==
Non-EU consultancies offer "only representative" services, though according to REACH it is not possible to register a substance if your "only representative" consultancy company is not based in the EU, unless it is subcontracted to an EU-based registrant.

Only representatives are EU based entities that must comply with REACH (Article 8) and should operate standard, transparent working practices. The Only Representative assumes responsibility and [[Legal liability|liability]] for fulfilling obligiations of importers in accordance with REACH for substances being brought into the EU by a non-EU manufacturer.

The SIEFs will bring new challenges. An article in the business news service [[Chemical Watch]] described how some "pre-registrants" may simply be consultants hoping for work ("gold diggers") while others may be aiming to charge exorbitant rates for the data they have to offer ("jackals").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Authorisation List==
The [[European Chemical Agency]] (ECHA) has published the REACH Authorisation List,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/authorisation/recommendation-for-inclusion-in-the-authorisation-list/authorisation-list|title=Page has moved - ECHA|website=echa.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to tighten the use of [[substance of very high concern|Substances of Very High Concern]] (SVHCs). The list is an official recommendation from the ECHA to the [[European Commission]]. The list is also regularly updated and expanded. Currently the Candidate List for Authorisation comprises a total of 173 SVHCs, some of which are already active on the Authorization List.

To sell or use these substances, manufacturers, importers, and retailers in the [[European Union]] (EU) must apply for authorization from the [[European Chemical Agency|ECHA]]. The applicant is to submit a chemical safety report on the risks entailed by the substance, as well as an analysis of possible alternative substances or technologies including present and future [[research and development]] processed.

'''Religious abuse''' is [[abuse]] administered under the guise of [[religion]], including [[harassment]] or [[humiliation]], which may result in [[psychological trauma]]. Religious abuse may also include misuse of religion for [[Selfishness|selfish]], [[Secularism|secular]], or [[Ideology|ideological]] ends such as the abuse of a clerical position.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Wright, ''Religious Abuse'', Wood Lake Publishing Inc., 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological abuse==
One specific meaning of the term ''religious abuse'' refers to [[psychological manipulation]] and harm inflicted on a person by using the teachings of their religion. This is perpetrated by members of the same or similar faith, and includes the use of a position of authority within the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiritwatch.org/relabdef.htm |title=What Religious Abuse Is About |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most often directed at children and emotionally vulnerable adults, and motivations behind such abuse vary, but can be either well-intentioned or malicious.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite book |author=Wright, Keith T. |title=Religious Abuse: A Pastor Explores the Many Ways Religion Can Hurt As Well As Heal |publisher=Northstone Publishing |location=Kelowna, B.C |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=1-896836-47-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even well-intentioned religious abuse can have long-term psychological consequences, such as the victim developing [[phobia]]s or long-term [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. They may have a sense of shame that persists even after they leave the religion. A person can also be manipulated into avoiding a beneficial action (such as a medical treatment) or to engage in a harmful behavior.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

In his book ''Religious Abuse'', pastor Keith Wright describes an example of such abuse. When he was a child, his [[Christian Scientist]] mother became very ill and eventually was convinced to seek medical treatment at an inpatient facility. Members of her church went to the treatment center to convince her to trust prayer rather than treatment, and to leave. She died shortly thereafter. While the church members may not have had any malicious intent, their use of their religion's teachings to manipulate Wright's mother ultimately resulted in her death.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

==Against children==
Religiously-based psychological abuse of children can involve using teachings to subjugate children through fear, or indoctrinating the child in the beliefs of their particular religion whilst suppressing other perspectives. Psychologist Jill Mytton describes this as crushing the child's chance to form a personal morality and belief system; it makes them utterly reliant on their religion and/or parents, and they never learn to [[Critical thinking|reflect critically]] on information they receive. Similarly, the use of fear and a judgmental environment (such as the concept of [[Hell]]) to control the child can be traumatic.&lt;ref name=Mytton&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXA7GA9yntc |title=YouTube - Jill Mytton Interview - Richard Dawkins |work= |accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical abuse==
Physical abuse in a religious context often takes the form of beatings, illegal confinement, neglect, near drowning or even murder in the belief that the child is [[Demonic possession|possessed by evil spirits]], practicing sorcery or [[witchcraft]], or has committed some kind of [[sin]] that warrants punishment. Such extreme cases are, though, rare.

In 2012, the United Kingdom's [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] instituted a new action plan to investigate the issue of faith-based abuse after several high-profile murders, such as that Kristy Bamu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/couple-guilty-of-horrific-witchcraft-murder-7468465.html|title=Couple guilty of horrific witchcraft murder|date=1 March 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a term of 10 years, [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]] conducted 83 investigations into allegations of abuse with faith-based elements and feared there were even more that were unreported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = BBC News - Witchcraft-based child abuse: Action plan launched | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19248144 | publisher =  | accessdate = 15 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious violence==
{{Main|Religious violence}}
Religious violence and extremism (also called communal violence&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, D.L. (2000) The Deadly Ethnic Riot. University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA&lt;/ref&gt;) is a term that covers all phenomena where [[religion]] is either the subject or object of violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Wellman|first= James|author2=Tokuno, Kyoko |year= 2004|title= Is Religious Violence Inevitable?|publisher=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2004.00234.x|journal= Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume= 43|pages= 291|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human sacrifice===
{{Main|Child sacrifice|Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures}}
[[Archaeology]] has uncovered physical evidence of [[child sacrifice]] at several locations.&lt;ref name="Hardness"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hardness of Heart / Hardness of Life: The Stain of Human Infanticide|last=Milner|first=Larry S.|publisher=University Press of America|year=2000}}&lt;!-- pp. 16-22 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the best attested examples are the diverse rites which were part of the religious practices in [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Inca Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Reinhard  | first = Johan  |author2=Maria Stenzel  | title = A 6,700 metros niños incas sacrificados quedaron congelados en el tiempo  | journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]  | pages = 36–55  |date=November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exn.ca/mummies/story.asp?id=1999041452|title=Watch video online|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = de Sahagún  | first = Bernardino | authorlink = Bernardino de Sahagún  | title = [[Florentine Codex|''Florentine Codex: History of the Things of New Spain'']], 12 books and 2 introductory volumes  | publisher = University of Utah Press, translated and edited by Arthur J.O.

[[Plutarch]] (c.46–120 AD) mentions the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]]'s ritual burning of small children, as do [[Tertullian]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Philo]]. [[Livy]] and [[Polybius]] do not. The [[Hebrew Bible]] also mentions what appears to be child sacrifice practised at a place called the [[Tophet]] (''roasting place'') by the [[Canaan]]ites, and by some Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Brown  | first = Shelby  | title = Late Carthaginian Child Sacrifice and Sacrificial Monuments in their Mediterranean Context  | publisher = Sheffield Academic Press  | year = 1991  | location = Sheffield   | pages =  | url =  | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children were thrown to the sharks in ancient [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Davies  | first = Nigel  | title = Human Sacrifice in History and Today  | publisher = William Morrow &amp; Co.  | year = 1981  | location = NY  | pages = 192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacrificial victims were often infants. "The slaughtering of newborn babies may be considered a common event in many cultures" including the [[Eskimo]], the [[Polynesians]], the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], the [[Scandinavia]]ns, and various indigenous peoples of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africa]], [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|the Americas]] and [[Indigenous Australians|Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Grotstein | first = James S. | authorlink =  | title = Who is the dreamer who dreams the dream?| publisher = The Analytic Press, Relational Perspectives Book Series Volume 19 edition | year = 2000  | location = NJ| pages = 247, 242  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiation rites===
{{Main|Initiation rite}}
[[Artificial deformation of the skull]] predates written history and dates back as far as 45,000 BCE, as evidenced by two [[Neanderthal]] skulls found in [[Shanidar Cave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Trinkaus |first= Erik |date=April 1982|title= Artificial Cranial Deformation in the Shanidar 1 and 5 Neandertals|journal= Current Anthropology |volume= 23|issue= 2|pages= 198–199 |jstor= 2742361|doi= 10.1086/202808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was usually started just after birth and continued until the desired shape was achieved. It may have played a key role in Egyptian and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Rousselle  | first = Aline  | title = Porneia: On Desire and the Body in Antiquity  | publisher = Basil Blackwell  | year = 1983  | location = Oxford  | pages = 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]] some boys were castrated, with both the penis and scrotum cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Tompkins| first = Peter| title = The Eunuch and the Virgin: A Study of Curious Customs | publisher = Bramhall House | year = 1963  | location = NY| pages = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Ritual#Ritual actions|ritual actions]] have been described by [[anthropologists]]. [[Géza Róheim]] wrote about initiation rituals performed by Australian natives in which adolescent initiates were forced to drink [[blood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Róheim  | first = Géza | authorlink =  Géza Róheim | title =  Psychoanalysis and Anthropology | publisher =  International Universities Press| year =  1950| location =  NY| pages =  76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual [[rape]] of young [[virgin]]s have been part of [[shaman]]istic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =  Nevill | first =  Drury | authorlink =  | title =  The Elements of Shamanism | publisher =  Element| year =  1989| location =  Longmead| pages =  20| url =  | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern practices===
In some tribes rituals of [[Papua New Guinea]], an elder "picks out a sharp stick of cane and sticks it deep inside a boy's nostrils until he bleeds profusely into the stream of a pool, an act greeted by loud war cries."&lt;ref name="Sambia ritual" &gt;{{cite book  | last =   Herdt | first =  Gilbert | authorlink = Gilbert Herdt| title =  The Sambia: Ritual, Sexuality, and Change in Papua New Guinea (Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology) | publisher =  Wadsworth Publishing; 2 edition | year =  2005| location =  Longmead| page = 85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, when boys are initiated into puberty and manhood, they are expected to perform [[fellatio]] on the elders. "Not all initiates will participate in this ceremonial homosexual activity but, about five days later, several will have to perform fellatio several times."&lt;ref name="Sambia ritual" /&gt;

===Witch-hunts===
{{Further|Witch-hunt}}
{{Further|Witchcraft accusations against children in Africa}}

To this day, witch hunts, trials and accusations are still a real danger in some parts of the world. Trials result in violence against men, women and children, including murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/05/witches-feminism-books-kristin-j-sollee|title=Are witches the ultimate feminists?|last=Kelly|first=Kim|date=2017-07-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Gambia]], about 1,000 people accused of being witches were locked in government detention centers in March 2009, being beaten, forced to drink an unknown [[hallucinogenic]] potion, and confess to witchcraft, according to [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2009/03/gambia-hundreds-accused-e2809cwitchcrafte2809d-and-poisoned-government-campaign-20/|title=The Gambia: Hundreds accused of "witchcraft" and poisoned in government campaign|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/19/gambia-witchcraft-hallucinogenics|title=Gambian state kidnaps 1,000 villagers in mass purge of 'witchcraft'|last=Rice|first=Xan|date=2009-03-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania thousands of elderly Tanzanian women have been strangled, knifed to death and burned alive over the last two decades after being denounced as witches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tanzania-women-landrights/despite-murderous-attacks-tanzanias-witches-fight-for-land-idUSKBN16S2HU|title=Despite murderous attacks, Tanzania's 'witches' fight for land|date=21 March 2017|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritualistic abuse may also involve children accused of, and punished for, being purported witches in some [[Central Africa]]n areas.

===Psychohistorical explanation===
{{Main|Psychohistorical views on infanticide}}

A small number of academics subscribe to the theory of [[psychohistory]] and attribute the abusive rituals to the [[psychopathology|psychopathological]] [[projection (psychology)|projection]] of the perpetrators, especially the parents.&lt;ref name="EMOL"/&gt;&lt;!-- pp. 258-262 --&gt;&lt;ref name="OneCosmos"/&gt;&lt;!-- pp. 124-176 --&gt;

This ''psychohistorical'' model claims that practices of [[Tribal society|tribal societies]] sometimes included [[incest]] and the sacrifice, [[mutilation]], rape and [[torture]] of children, and that such activities were culturally acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=deMause |first=Lloyd  |authorlink=Lloyd deMause|title=Foundations of Psychohistory |url= |edition= |series= |date= January 1982  |publisher=Creative Roots Publishing  |location= |isbn=0-940508-01-X |oclc= |doi=  |pages=132–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Rascovsky  | first = A.  | title = Filicide: The Murder, Humiliation, Mutilation, Denigration and Abandonment of Children by Parents  | publisher = [[Jason Aronson|Aronson]]  | year = 1995  | location = NJ  | pages = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual abuse==
Spiritual abuse includes:
* [[Psychological abuse]] and [[emotional abuse]]
* [[Physical abuse]] including physical injury and deprivation of sustenance.
* [[Sexual abuse]]
* Any act by deeds or words that [[shame]] or diminish the [[dignity]] of a person.
* [[Intimidation]] and the requirement to [[Submission|submit]] to a spiritual authority without any right to dissent.
* Unreasonable control of a person's basic right to exercise [[freewill]] in spiritual or natural matters.
* [[False accusation]]s and repeated [[criticism]] by labeling a person as, for example, disobedient, rebellious, lacking faith, [[demonization|demonized]], [[apostate]], an enemy of the church or of a deity.
* [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|Isolationism]], separation, [[disenfranchisement]] or estrangement from family and friends outside the group due to cult-religious or spiritual or indigenous beliefs.
* [[Esotericism]], hidden agendas and requirements revealed to members only as they successfully advance through various stages of a faith.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Steven Lambert, ''Charismatic Captivation, Authoritarian Abuse &amp; Psychological Enslavement in Neo-Pentecostal Churches'' (Real Truth Publications, 1996); adapted article available online: "Signs of Spiritual Abuse" [http://www.charismatic-captivation.com/?p=5]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Enforced practice of [[spiritualism]], [[mysticism]], or other ideologies peculiar to members of that religion.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, ''Charismatic Captivation; adapted article available online: "Signs of Spiritual Abuse" [http://www.charismatic-captivation.com/?p=5]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Financial exploitation or [[enslavement]] of adherents.&lt;ref name="Lambert5"&gt;Lambert, ''Charismatic Captivation''; adapted article available online: "Signs of Spiritual Abuse" [http://www.charismatic-captivation.com/?p=5]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
The term ''spiritual abuse'' was purportedly coined in the late twentieth century to refer to alleged abuse of authority by church leaders,&lt;ref&gt;Jeff VanVonderen: "Spiritual abuse occurs when someone in a position of spiritual authority, the purpose of which is to 'come underneath' and serve, build, equip and make a deity's or a god's people MORE free, misuses that authority placing themselves over a god's people to control, coerce or manipulate them for seemingly godly purposes which are really their own."[http://www.spiritualabuse.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; albeit some scholars and historians would dispute that claim, citing prior literary appearances of the term in literature on religion and psychology. Lambert defines spiritual abuse as "a type of psychological predomination that could be rightly termed—''religious enslavement''."&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, ''Charismatic Captivation''; p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; He further identifies "religious enslavement" as being a product of what is termed in the [[Bible]] "[[witchcraft]]," or "[[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]."&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles 33:6; Galatians 5:20; Revelation 18:23; et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
[[Ronald Enroth]] in ''[[Churches That Abuse]]'' identifies five categories:{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

# '''Authority and Power''': abuse arises when leaders of a group arrogate to themselves power and authority that lacks the dynamics of open accountability and the capacity to question or challenge decisions made by leaders. The shift entails moving from general respect for an office bearer to one where members loyally submit without any right to dissent.
# '''[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]] and Control''': abusive groups are characterized by social dynamics where [[fear]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] or [[threats]] are routinely used to produce unquestioning obedience, group conformity or stringent tests of [[loyalty]]. The leader-disciple relationship may become one in which the leader's decisions control and usurp the disciple's right or capacity to make choices.
# '''[[Elitism]] and Persecution''': abusive groups depict themselves as unique and have a strong organizational tendency to be separate from other bodies and institutions. The social dynamism of the group involves being independent or separate, with diminishing possibilities for internal correction or reflection, whilst outside criticism.
# '''Life-style and Experience''': abusive groups foster rigidity in behavior and belief that requires conformity to the group's ideals.
# '''Dissent and Discipline''': abusive groups tend to suppress any kind of internal challenge to decisions made by leaders.

Agnes and John Lawless argue in ''The Drift into Deception'' that there are eight characteristics of spiritual abuse, and some of these clearly overlap with Enroth's criteria. They list the eight marks of spiritual abuse as comprising: {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
#[[Charisma]] and [[pride]]
#[[Anger]] and [[intimidation]]
#[[Seven deadly sins#Greed|Greed]] and [[fraud]]
#[[Immorality]]
#Enslaving [[authoritarian]] structure
#Exclusivity
#Demanding [[loyalty]] and honor
#New revelation

The author of ''Charismatic Captivation''&lt;ref&gt;Charismatic Captivation, by Steven Lambert&lt;/ref&gt; in a post on the book's website delineates "33 Signs of Spiritual Abuse",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charismatic-captivation.com/?p=5|title=The Signs of Spiritual Abuse|date=15 November 2008|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

#Apotheosis or de facto deification of the leadership.
#Absolute authority of the leadership.
#Pervasive abuse and misuse of authority in personal dealings with members to coerce submission.
#Paranoia, inordinate egotism or narcissism, and insecurity by the leaders.
#Abuse and inordinate incidence of "church discipline" particularly in matters not expressly considered to be church discipline issues.
#Inordinate attention to maintaining the public image of the ministry and lambasting of all "critics".
#Constant indoctrination with a "group" or "family" mentality that impels members to exalt the corporate "life" and goals of the church-group over their personal goals, callings, objectives or relationships.
#Members are psychologically traumatized, terrorized and indoctrinated with numerous fears aimed at creating an over-dependence or codependence on their leaders and the corporate group.
#Members may be required to obtain the approval (or ''witness'') of their leader(s) for decisions regarding personal matters.
#Frequent preaching from the pulpit discouraging leaving the religion or disobeying the leaderships' dictates.
#Members departing without the blessing of the leadership do so under a cloud of suspicion, shame, or slander.
#Departing members often suffer from psychological problems and display the symptoms associated with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).

===Research and examples===
Flavil Yeakley's team of researchers conducted field-tests with members of the [[Boston Church of Christ]] using the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]]. In ''The Discipling Dilemma'' Yeakley reports that the members tested "showed a high level of change in psychological type scores", with a "clear pattern of convergence in a single type".&lt;ref name="Yeakley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yeakley|first1=Flavil|title=The Discipling Dilemma|date=1988|publisher=Gospel Advocate Company|location=Nashville|isbn=0-89225-311-8|page=39|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same tests were conducted on five mainline [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s and with six groups that are popularly labeled as [[cult]]s or manipulative [[sect]]s. Yeakley's test results showed that the pattern in the Boston Church "was not found among other churches of Christ or among members of five mainline denominations, but that it was found in studies of six manipulative sects."&lt;ref name="Yeakley"/&gt; The research did ''not'' show that the Boston Church was "attracting people with a psychological need for high levels of control", but Yeakley concluded that "they are producing conformity in psychological type" which he deemed to be "unnatural, unhealthy and dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;Yeakley p44, p46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not a [[longitudinal study]] and relied on asking participants to answer the survey three times; once as they imagined they might answer five years prior, once as their present selves and once as they imagined they might answer after five years of influence in the sect. The author insists that despite this, "any significant changes in the pattern of these perceptions would indicate some kind of group pressure. A high degree of change and a convergence in a single type would be convincing proof that the Boston Church of Christ has some kind of group dynamic operating that tends to produce conformity to the group norm." However it could instead indicate a desire on the part of the respondents to change in the direction indicated. To determine actual changes in MBTI results would require a longitudinal study, since the methodology here was inherently suggestive of its conclusion. This is also amply borne out in its instructions: "The instructions stated clearly that no one was telling them that their answers ought to change. The instructions said that the purpose of the study was simply to find out if there were any changes and, if so, what those changes might indicate."&lt;ref&gt;Yeakley p.30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6654">In [[telecommunications]], '''return loss''' is the loss of [[power (physics)|power]] in the [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] returned/reflected by a discontinuity in a [[transmission line]] or [[optical fiber]].  This discontinuity can be a mismatch with the terminating load or with a device inserted in the line.  It is usually expressed as a ratio in [[decibel]]s (dB);

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm i \over P_\mathrm r}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''RL''(dB) is the return loss in dB, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the incident power and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the reflected power.
Return loss is related to both [[standing wave ratio]] (SWR) and [[reflection coefficient]] (Γ).  Increasing return loss corresponds to lower SWR.  Return loss is a measure of how well devices or lines are matched.  A match is good if the return loss is high.  A high return loss is desirable and results in a lower [[insertion loss]].

Return loss is used in modern practice in preference to SWR because it has better resolution for small values of reflected wave.&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;

==Sign==
Properly, loss quantities, when expressed in decibels, should be positive numbers.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Except for cases where an active device succeeds in reflecting back more power than was sent into it.  This is the case, for instance, with the [[negative resistance#Amplifiers|tunnel diode amplifier]].&lt;/ref&gt;  However, return loss has historically been expressed as a negative number, and this convention is still widely found in the literature.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;Trevor S. Bird, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5162049 "Definition and Misuse of Return Loss"], ''IEEE Antennas &amp; Propagation Magazine'', '''vol.51''', iss.2, pp.166-167, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct definition of return loss is the difference in dB between the incident power sent towards the Device Under Test (DUT) and the power reflected, resulting in a positive sign:

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm i \over P_\mathrm r}&lt;/math&gt;

However taking the ratio of '''reflected''' to '''incident''' power results in a negative sign for return loss;

:&lt;math&gt;RL'(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm r \over P_\mathrm i}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''RL'''(dB) is the negative of ''RL''(dB).
Return loss with a positive sign is identical to the magnitude of Γ when expressed in decibels but of opposite sign.  That is, return loss with a negative sign is more properly called reflection coefficient.&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;  The [[S-parameter]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; from [[two-port network]] theory is frequently also called return loss,&lt;ref&gt;Noel G. Barton, Jacques Periaux, "Coupling of fluids, structures, and waves in aeronautics", proceedings of a French-Australian workshop in Melbourne, Australia, 3–6 December 2001, p.187, Springer, 2003 {{ISBN|3-540-40222-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but is actually equal to Γ.

Caution is required when discussing increasing or decreasing return loss since these terms strictly have the opposite meaning when return loss is defined as a negative quantity.

==Electrical==
In metallic conductor systems, reflections of a signal traveling down a conductor can occur at a discontinuity or [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] mismatch. The ratio of the amplitude of the reflected wave ''V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the amplitude of the incident wave ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is known as the [[reflection coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit \Gamma = {V_\mathrm r \over V_\mathrm i}&lt;/math&gt;

When the source and load impedances are known values, the reflection coefficient is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit \Gamma = { {Z_\mathrm L - Z_\mathrm S} \over {Z_\mathrm L + Z_\mathrm S} }&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the impedance toward the [[voltage source|source]] and ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the impedance toward the [[Electrical load|load]].

Return loss is the negative of the magnitude of the reflection coefficient in dB. Since power is proportional to the square of the voltage, return loss is given by,

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = -20 \log_{10} \left| \mathit \Gamma \right|&lt;/math&gt;

where  the [[vertical direction|vertical]] bars indicate [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]. Thus, a large positive return loss indicates the reflected power is small relative to the incident power, which indicates good impedance match from source to load.

When the actual transmitted (incident) power and the reflected power are known (i.e., through measurements and/or calculations), then the return loss in dB can be calculated as the difference between the incident power ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (in [[dBm]]) and the reflected power ''P''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; (in dBm),

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = P_\mathrm i(\mathrm{dBm}) - P_\mathrm r(\mathrm{dBm})\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Optical==
In [[optics]] (particularly in [[optical fiber|fiberoptics]]) a loss that takes place at discontinuities of [[refractive index]], especially at an air-[[glass]] [[wiktionary:interface|interface]] such as a fiber endface. At those interfaces, a fraction of the optical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] is reflected back toward the source.  This reflection phenomenon is also called "'''[[Fresnel reflection]] loss'''," or simply "'''Fresnel loss'''."

Fiber optic transmission systems use [[laser]]s to transmit signals over optical fiber, and a high optical return loss (ORL) can cause the laser to stop transmitting correctly. The measurement of ORL is becoming more important in the characterization of optical networks as the use of [[wavelength-division multiplexing]] increases.  These systems use lasers that have a lower tolerance for ORL, and introduce elements into the network that are located in close proximity to the laser.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{ORL}(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm i \over P_\mathrm r}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_\mathrm r&lt;/math&gt; is the reflected power and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_\mathrm i&lt;/math&gt; is the incident, or input, power.

A '''skull cup''' is a drinking vessel or eating bowl made from an inverted human [[calvaria (skull)|calvaria]] that has been cut away from the rest of the [[skull]].  The use of a [[human skull]] as a drinking [[cup]] in ritual use or as a trophy is reported in numerous sources throughout history and among various peoples, and among Western cultures is most often associated with the historically nomadic cultures of the [[Eurasia]]n [[steppe]].

==Asia==
According to Herodotus' [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]], [[Scythians]] killed their enemies and made their skulls into drinking cups.  The oldest record in the Chinese annals of the skull-cup tradition dates from the last years of the [[Spring and Autumn period]], when the victors of the [[Battle of Jinyang]] in 453 BC made the skull of their enemy into a winecup.&lt;ref&gt;Sima Qian [[s:zh:史記/卷086|vol.86]]: 趙襄子最怨智伯，漆其頭以為飲器。&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' recorded the practice among the ancient [[Xiongnu]] of present-day [[Mongolia]]. [[Laoshang Chanyu|Laoshang]] (or Jizhu), son of the Xiongnu chieftain [[Modu Chanyu]], killed the king of the [[Yuezhi]] around 162 BC, and in accordance with their tradition, "made a drinking cup out of his skull".&lt;ref&gt;[[Shiji]] 123.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the biography of the envoy [[Zhang Qian]] in ''[[Book of Han|Han shu]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Han shu'', 94B, p.&amp;nbsp;3a; Yu Yingshi, ''Trade and Expansion in Han China'', 1967:218.&lt;/ref&gt; the drinking cup made from the skull of the Yuezhi king was later used when the Xiongnu concluded a treaty with two Han ambassadors during the reign of Emperor Yuan (49-33 BC). To seal the convention, the Chinese ambassadors drank blood from the skull cup with the Xiongnu chiefs.

In 1510, Shah [[Ismail I]] defeated and slew [[Muhammad Shaybani]] in battle, founder of the [[Shaybanid Empire]] in present-day [[Uzbekistan]]. The Shah had his enemy's body dismembered and the parts were sent to various areas of the empire for display, while his skull was coated in gold and made into a jewelled drinking goblet.

In [[Japan]], the famed warlord [[Oda Nobunaga]] led a number of campaigns against the Azai and Asakura clans beginning in 1570. Following his victories at the [[siege]]s of [[Siege of Odani Castle|Odani]] and [[Siege of Ichijōdani Castle|Ichijōdani Castle]]s in 1573, he took the skulls of [[Azai Nagamasa]], his father [[Azai Hisamasa|Hisamasa]], and [[Asakura Yoshikage]] and had them prepared for display and for use as ''[[sake]]'' cups (''[[sake set|o-choko]]'').&lt;ref name=west143&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weston |first= Mark|title= Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Greatest Men and Women|publisher= Kodansha International|place= NYC |page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike skull cups of other cultures, which might resemble a bowl or a [[chalice]] in the finished form, the Japanese artisans excised a shallow, saucer-shaped portion from the top of the each skull, then [[lacquer]]ed the skulls, covered them in [[gold leaf]], and each cup was set in the aperture from which it had been cut, [[wikt: concave|concave]] side up. Nobunaga then presented the three skulls to his vassals and drank ''sake'' from the cups, in order to demonstrate the fate of those who would oppose or betray him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Kuwata |first= Tadachika | script-title=ja:信長公記 | year= 1997 | publisher= Shinjinbutsu| location= Tokyo |language= Japanese |trans-title=[[Shinchō kōki]] (Chronicle of Nobunaga) |isbn= 4-404-02493-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three skulls were probably lost when [[Azuchi Castle]] was destroyed in 1582.

In India and Tibet the skull cup is known as a ''[[Kapala]]'', and is used in [[Buddhist]] [[tantra|tantric]] and [[Hindu]] [[tantra|tantric]] rituals. The skull does not belong to an enemy, and indeed the identity of the skull's original owner is not considered significant, as ritual purity in death has divested the human soul from its corporeal form. Hindu deities such as [[Kali]] are sometimes depicted holding a ''kapala'' full of human blood. Many carved and elaborately mounted ''kapalas'' survive, mostly in Tibet.

The [[Scythia]]ns are reported by [[Herodotus]] (ca.484 – ca.425 BC) and later [[Strabo]] (63/64 BC&amp;nbsp;– ca.24 AD) to have drunk from the skulls of their enemies. 

[[Edouard Chavannes]] quotes [[Livy]] to illustrate the ceremonial use of skull cups by the [[Boii]], a [[Celts|Celtic]] tribe in Europe in 216 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Chavannes |first= Edouard |title= Mémoires historiques |volume= 5 |pages= 185–186 |url= http://classiques.uqac.ca/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul the Deacon]]'s ''[[Historia Langobardorum]]'', when the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Alboin]] defeated the [[Gepids]], hereditary enemies of his people, in 567 AD, he then slew their new king Cunimund, fashioned a drinking-cup from his skull, and took his daughter Rosamund as a wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924027767593  |title=''History of the Langobards'' |author= [[Paul the Deacon]]|year= 1907 | publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press| location= [[Philadelphia]] |accessdate= |others=translator: [[William Dudley Foulke]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Krum]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] was said by [[Theophanes the Confessor]], [[Joannes Zonaras]], Mannases Chronicle, and others, to have made a jeweled cup from the skull of the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Nicephorus I]] (811 AD) after killing him in the [[Battle of Pliska]].

The [[Russian Primary Chronicle]] reports that the skull of [[Svyatoslav I]] of [[Kiev]] was made into a chalice by the [[Pecheneg]] [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Kurya (khan)|Kurya]] in 972 AD. He likely intended this as a compliment to Sviatoslav; sources report that Kurya and his wife drank from the skull and prayed for a son as brave as the deceased Rus warlord.

According to [[George Akropolites]] the skull of [[Baldwin I of Constantinople]] was made into a drinking cup by the Tsar [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]] (c.  1205).

According to legend, after the Pirate [[Blackbeard]] was killed and beheaded in 1718, his skull was made into a drinking cup.

In 19th century [[England]], the poet [[Lord Byron]] used a skull his gardener had found at [[Newstead Abbey]] as a drinking vessel. "There had been found by the gardener, in digging,  a skull that had probably belonged to some jolly monk or friar of the Abbey, about the time it was demonasteried. Observing it to be of giant size, and in a perfect state of preservation, a strange fancy seized me of having it set and mounted as a drinking cup. I accordingly sent it to town, and it returned with a very high polish and of a mottled colour like tortoiseshell".  Byron even wrote a darkly witty drinking poem as if inscribed upon it,  “Lines Inscribed upon a Cup Formed from a Skull”.&lt;ref&gt;Newstead, 1808&lt;/ref&gt; The cup, filled with [[claret]], was passed around "in imitation of the [[Goths]] of old", among the Order of the Skull that Byron founded at Newstead, "whilst many a grim joke was cut at its expense", Byron recalled to Thomas Medwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Thomas |first= Medwin| title= Conversations of Lord Byron: noted during a residence with his lordship |year= 1824 |page= 70f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5265">{{see also|Tie-breaking in Swiss-system tournaments}}
The '''Sonneborn–Berger score''' (or the '''Neustadtl score''') is a [[Tie-breaking in Swiss-system tournaments|scoring system]] often used to [[tiebreakers|break ties]] in [[chess tournaments]]. As the Neustadtl score it is named after [[Hermann Neustadtl]], who proposed it in a letter published in ''[[The Chess Monthly (1879–1896)|Chess Monthly]]'' in 1882.

It is often called the Sonneborn–Berger score, though this is something of a misnomer, since [[William Sonneborn]] and [[Johann Berger]] were actually strong critics of the system; they proposed [[#Non-Neustadtl Sonneborn–Berger score|their own tie-breaking system]] that added in the raw score of each player but that did not help with tiebreaking and was therefore never popular and is not in use today.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

More common tiebreaking methods in [[chess tournaments]] include the Neustadtl Sonneborn–Berger score, head-to-head score, [[Koya score]], or favouring the player with the most wins (or black games). In [[Swiss system]] events, comparison of the [[Buchholz score]]s and the sum of progressive scores are common.

==Neustadtl Sonneborn–Berger score==
A player's ''Neustadtl Sonneborn–Berger score'' is calculated by adding the sum of the conventional scores of the players he/she has defeated to half the sum of the conventional scores of those he/she has [[draw (chess)|drawn]] against.

The main point is to give more value for a win/draw against a player ranked high, than for a win/draw against a player ranked low in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chess.com/tournaments/help#tiebreak Chess.com: Tie-break methods]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since players may share the same Neustadtl score, further means of breaking ties may be required; common methods include considering the score in games played between the tied players or favouring the player with the most wins. Some tournaments do not use Neustadtl to break ties at all ([[Linares chess tournament|Linares]], for example, gives preference to the player with the most wins), and others use no tie-breaking method at all, sharing the prize money on offer between players. In national championships or events which act as qualifying tournaments for others, there may be a [[blitz chess|blitz]] playoff between the tied players. Neustadtl remains the most common tie-breaking method in [[round-robin tournament]]s, though in [[Swiss system]] events, comparison of the [[Buchholz score]]s and the [[sum of progressive scores]] is more common.

As an example of the system in action, here is the [[crosstable]] of the 1975–80 [[World Correspondence Chess Championship]] Final (here '''cs''' indicates conventional score, '''ns''' Neustadtl score):

==Non-Neustadtl Sonneborn-Berger score ==
The ''Non-Neustadtl Sonneborn–Berger score'' is a scoring system used in [[chess]] tournaments and is considered an improvement to the [[#Neustadtl Sonneborn–Berger score|Neustadtl score]] proposed by William Sonneborn and [[Johann Berger]]. Sonneborn was a strong critic of the Neustadtl score, and suggested adding in the player's raw score. Berger supported this. However, adding in the raw score does no good when ranking tied players, and the suggestion died out and is seldom used today. However, the Neustadtl score is now commonly known as the Sonneborn–Berger score.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Oxford Companion to Chess]], Hooper and Whyld, 1992, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

see Appendix for summary of Taiheki concept.
&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was established by {{Nihongo| [[Haruchika Noguchi]]|野口 晴哉}}, who was the founder and a teacher of {{Nihongo| ''[[seitai]]''|整体}} in Japan. Noguchi said that man's tendency of sensitivity can be divided into five categories, each of which is divided into two types, one of which is active (odd-numbered types) whereas the other of which is passive (even-numbered types). In addition, there are two anomalous types. Thus, 12 types of ''taiheki'' in total have been defined.&lt;ref name="taiheki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scolding" /&gt; Among them, odd-numbered types have a tendency to release of compressed energy in an active way, whereas even-numbered types are passive and require others' attention to release compressed energy.&lt;ref name="taiheki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scolding" /&gt; The 12 types are like pure colors in color, and they are usually mixed up with each other in one person (this is called complex ''taiheki'').&lt;ref name="scolding" /&gt;

The concept of ''taiheki'' is somehow similar to the typology by [[Ernst Kretschmer]], [[Enneagram of Personality]] and [[Four Temperaments]]. However, ''taiheki'' is not only applicable to psychological aspects such as one's emotional or behavioural tendency, but also to one's physical characteristics including shape of face and body, balance of weights, and tendency seen in movement.&lt;ref name="taiheki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scolding" /&gt; According to him, all these aspects are correlated with state of 5 [[lumbar vertebrae]].&lt;ref name="taiheki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scolding" /&gt; In Japanese, {{Nihongo|''tai''|体}} means “body”, whereas {{Nihongo|''heki''|癖}} represents “habit” or "tendency". Noguchi established the concept of taiheki through his as activity as healer and seitai teacher sometime during the early 1950s.

A modified weight scale called as {{Nihongo|''Tairyo Haibun Kei''|体量配分計}} (body mass distribution meter) is used to tell somebody's taiheki.&lt;ref name="taiheki" /&gt; The scale's platform is divided into left and right parts for both legs, and each of the parts is further divided into 3 parts: frontal right, frontal left, and rear parts. Thus one stands over the 6 parts of the platform. When he makes postures, such as brace and forward-bending position, the scale gives data of biased balance of his weight in certain direction for each posture. According to Noguchi, each taiheki has a distinct tendency of biased balance of weight in each posture.&lt;ref name="taiheki" /&gt; One can hence determine somebody's taiheki based on the collected data.&lt;ref name="taiheki" /&gt;

Alternatively, without using special apparatus, one's taiheki can be estimated by observation of his/her physical constitution, postural characteristics, kinetic features, or psychological tendency in sensitivity&lt;ref name="taiheki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scolding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="karadanikiku"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Noguchi said that people with Upwards and Downwards category are least wild and like [[xian]]/[[sennin]]/hsien (in Taoism, Xian is believed to live in high mountain, or in heaven, be immortal, and have some magical power. By this simile, Noguchi meant that people of these taiheki are like living in imaginary world with overview of the real world).&lt;ref name="taiheki" /&gt; They tend to wear plain and conservative clothes.&lt;ref name="chara" /&gt;

*'''Taiheki type 1''' has a strong tendency of sublimating surplus energy into intellectual activity.&lt;ref name="taiheki" /&gt; People with this taiheki always try to understand the world linguistically.&lt;ref name="watching" /&gt; That is to say, they have an intense motivation to understand everything by explaining it with his own words. They like to think about something new actively, but, just getting an idea of results during their consideration, they often become satisfied quickly and lose their motivation to do it for real.&lt;ref name="taiheki" /&gt; When they feel tired, they often have a pain at the back of their neck.&lt;ref name="taiheki" /&gt; They cannot make an action without any good reason. When they have surplus energy, they tend to ponder more and become less active than usual. When you need to scold a person with taiheki type 1, Noguchi recommended to say things shortly to encourage his/her own thinking.&lt;ref name="scolding" /&gt; If you give lengthy scolding, the person would regard you as stupid.&lt;ref name="scolding" /&gt; It is said that most men have taiheki type 1 to some extent, and many characteristics accepted to be typical of men can thus be understood as a part of features of taiheki type 1.
*'''Taiheki type 2''' also likes thinking, but often gets stuck when trying to understand things with their own words. When they stuck with thinking, that is soon reflected by physical problems, such as stomachache. Differed from taiheki type 1, people with taiheki 2 are passive. They feel difficulty in taking action under their own responsibility and decision, while they feel ease when taking action according to opinions of, or under responsibility of, others. When tired, they often feel pain in [[Sternocleidomastoid muscle]].

[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr c1879.jpg|thumb|right|In the 19th century, there was a lack of confidence in the remedies of the day.  [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] said, "...if the whole ''[[materia medica]]'', as now used, could be sunk to the bottom of the sea, it would be so much the better for mankind – and all the worse for the fishes."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/10/29/therapeutic-nihilism-0 |title=Therapeutic nihilism |journal=British Medical Journal |author=Peter Morrell |volume=326 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7388.518/c |date=1 March 2003 |page=518}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Therapeutic nihilism''' is a contention that it is impossible to cure people or societies of their ills through treatment.

In medicine, it was connected to the idea that many "cures" do more harm than good, and that one should instead encourage the body to heal itself. [[Michel de Montaigne]] espoused this view in his ''[[Essais]]'' in 1580. This position was later popular, among other places, in France in the 1820s and 1830s, but has mostly faded away in the modern era due to the development of provably effective medicines such as [[antibiotics]]. However, a contemporary version of therapeutic nihilism is defended by Jacob Stegenga.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Medical Nihilism |author=Jacob Stegenga |publisher=OUP |year=2018 |isbn= 9780198747048 | url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/medical-nihilism-9780198747048?cc=hr&amp;lang=en&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Around the late 19th century, therapeutic nihilism gained some prominence among medical professionals. Proponents of this view claimed that every man should be his own physician through democratization of knowledge. Cultural critic [[Matthew Arnold]] wrote that “the stream of tendency of modern medical thought was toward a therapeutic nihilism.”

The most preferred treatment method at the time was active medication. Active medication represented, to some degree, the cutting-edge of existing medical thought, which also led to assumptions and inaccuracies. For example, when cocaine was first discovered, it was described in all of medical literature to have curative properties towards diseases such as gastralgia, childbirth, and nasal hemorrhage.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} This was in contrast to routine therapy, where the patient took the same medication consistently. Culturally, doctors were considered heroic figures when active medication worked while unsuccessful cases could be labeled as unfortunate and dismissed. [[Robert Bartholow]], a contemporary physician, said “the science of therapeutics should be made more certain” and that the “true knowledge of drug knowledge is not widely enough diffused.” In other words, the medical treatments of the 19th century have gained theoretical acceptance but were lacking in practicality. When faced with everyday exigencies, many physicians were left clueless. In addition, the ratio of medical practitioners to the US population in 1888 was 1 per 580 persons.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The medical community officially recognized these concerns in 1888 when the president of the [[American Medical Association]] stated that there were “odious defects in the American medical education system.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=CLARKE|first1=MAURICE D.|title=Therapeutic Nihilism|journal=The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal|date=30 August 1888|volume=119|issue=9|pages=199–201|doi=10.1056/NEJM188808301190903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapeutic nihilism slowly faded in the 19th century as systematic reform of the medical education system took place, then reappeared in the 20th century in a slightly different fashion than prior. The aggressive empiricism of the 19th century enlightened the medical society of the need to thoroughly evaluate every aspect of clinical practice. Prior to the publication of rigorous research later in the 20th century, some physicians believed the most potent weapon for treatment was not medication, but the regulation of bodily secretions such as extraction of blood, promotion of perspiration, or urination to regain the natural state of equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Charles|title=,THE THERAPEUTIC|journal=webcache.googleusercontent.com|date=1979|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:S9WhkkxRx8IJ:https://web.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/154/fixes/TherapeuticRevolution%2520Rosenberg.pdf+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivan Illich]] was one of the ardent supporters of therapeutic nihilism. In his book ''Medical Nemesis'', Illich claimed that the great increase in life expectancy and public health experienced in his era was due to improved nutrition and sanitation, rather than innovation in drugs and medicines. He also believed there was an excess of physicians, surgeries and prescriptions. Therapeutic nihilists claimed such excess often led to malpractice and increase in [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] (doctor-caused) injuries, accusing the physicians of creating even more illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Starr|first1=Paul|title=The Politics of Therapeutic Nihilism|journal=The Hastings Center Report|date=October 1976|volume=6|issue=5|pages=24|doi=10.2307/3561255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapeutic nihilism mostly faded by the mid-20th century, and some researchers have concluded that “therapeutic nihilism was replaced by an armamentarium of therapeutic inventions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cerebrovascular Disease: New Insights for the Healthcare Professional: 2011 Edition: ScholarlyPaper|publisher=ScholarlyEditions|isbn=9781464911965|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMTNobHjyRgC&amp;pg=PT3&amp;lpg=PT3&amp;dq=Cerebrovascular+Disease:+New+Insights+for+the+Healthcare+Professional,+ISBN&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-LOz5Zh10R&amp;sig=hfPmURVwxArVcFHyCtPJRsvVnN0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV_63rxLrSAhXnv1QKHSiAAhUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cerebrovascular%20Disease%3A%20New%20Insights%20for%20the%20Healthcare%20Professional%2C%20ISBN&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase ''therapeutic nihilism'' is included in a modern version of the [[Hippocratic Oath]], traditionally taken by physicians upon graduation, "... I will apply for the benefit of the sick, all measures [that] are required, avoiding those twin traps of over-treatment and therapeutic nihilism."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=55 |title=Hippocrates Cried |author=Michael Taylor |publisher=OUP USA |year=2013 |isbn=9780199948062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15057">'''Thrust-to-weight ratio''' is a [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] ratio of [[thrust]] to [[weight]] of a [[rocket]], [[jet engine]], [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] engine, or a vehicle propelled by such an engine that indicates the performance of the engine or vehicle.

The instantaneous thrust-to-weight ratio of a vehicle varies continually during operation due to progressive consumption of fuel or propellant and in some cases a gravity gradient.  The thrust-to-weight ratio based on initial thrust and weight is often published and used as a [[figure of merit]] for quantitative comparison of the initial performance of vehicles.

==Calculation==
The thrust-to-weight ratio can be calculated by dividing the thrust (in SI units &amp;ndash; in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s) by the weight (in newtons) of the engine or vehicle.  It is a dimensionless quantity. Note that the thrust can also be measured in [[Pound (force)|pound-force]] (lbf) provided the weight is measured in pounds (lb); the division of these two values still gives the numerically correct thrust-to-weight ratio.  For valid comparison of the initial thrust-to-weight ratio of two or more engines or vehicles, thrust must be measured under controlled conditions.

==Aircraft==
The thrust-to-weight ratio and [[wing loading]] are the two most important parameters in determining the performance of an aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Raymer, ''Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach'', Section 5.1&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the thrust-to-weight ratio of a [[combat aircraft]] is a good indicator of the maneuverability of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Fielding, ''Introduction to Aircraft Design'', Section 4.1.1 (p.37)&lt;/ref&gt;

The thrust-to-weight ratio varies continually during a flight.  Thrust varies with throttle setting, [[airspeed]], [[Altitude#Altitude in aviation|altitude]] and air temperature.  Weight varies with fuel burn and changes of payload.  For aircraft, the quoted thrust-to-weight ratio is often the maximum static thrust at sea-level divided by the [[maximum takeoff weight]].&lt;ref&gt;John P. Fielding, ''Introduction to Aircraft Design'', Section 3.1 (p.21)&lt;/ref&gt;

In cruising flight, the thrust-to-weight ratio of an aircraft is the inverse of the [[lift-to-drag ratio]] because thrust is the inverse of [[Drag (force)|drag]], and weight is the inverse of lift.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Raymer, ''Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach'', Equation 5.2&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left (\frac{T}{W}\right)_{cruise}=\frac{1}{(\frac{L}{D})_{cruise}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Propeller-driven aircraft===
For propeller-driven aircraft, the thrust-to-weight ratio can be calculated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Raymer, ''Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach'', Equations 3.9 and 5.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{T}{W}=\left(\frac{550\eta_p}{V}\right)\left(\frac{hp}{W}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\eta_p\;&lt;/math&gt; is [[propulsive efficiency]] (typically 0.8), &lt;math&gt;hp\;&lt;/math&gt; is the engine's [[shaft horsepower]], and &lt;math&gt;V\;&lt;/math&gt;is [[true airspeed]] in feet per second.

==Rockets==
[[File:Thrust to weight ratio vs Isp.png|thumb|Rocket vehicle Thrust-to-weight ratio vs [[specific impulse]] for different propellant technologies]]

The thrust-to-weight ratio of a rocket, or rocket-propelled vehicle, is an indicator of its acceleration expressed in multiples of gravitational acceleration g.&lt;ref name="sutton"&gt;George P. Sutton &amp; Oscar Biblarz, ''Rocket Propulsion Elements'' (p. 442, 7th edition) "thrust-to-weight ratio F/W&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is a dimensionless parameter that is identical to the acceleration of the rocket propulsion system (expressed in multiples of g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) if it could fly by itself in a gravity-free vacuum"&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockets and rocket-propelled vehicles operate in a wide range of gravitational environments, including the ''weightless'' environment. The thrust-to-weight ratio is usually calculated from initial gross weight at sea-level on earth&lt;ref&gt;George P. Sutton &amp; Oscar Biblarz, ''Rocket Propulsion Elements'' (p. 442, 7th edition) "The loaded weight W&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is the sea-level initial gross weight of propellant and rocket propulsion system hardware."&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes called ''Thrust-to-Earth-weight ratio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The thrust-to-Earth-weight ratio of a rocket or rocket-propelled vehicle is an indicator of its acceleration expressed in multiples of earth’s gravitational acceleration, g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="sutton"/&gt;

The thrust-to-weight ratio for a rocket varies as the propellant is burned. If the thrust is constant, then the maximum ratio (maximum acceleration of the vehicle) is achieved just before the propellant is fully consumed.  Each rocket has a characteristic thrust-to-weight curve or acceleration curve, not just a scalar quantity.

The thrust-to-weight ratio of an engine exceeds that of the whole launch vehicle but is nonetheless useful because it determines the maximum acceleration that any vehicle using that engine could theoretically achieve with minimum propellant and structure attached.

For a takeoff from the surface of the [[earth]] using thrust and no [[aerodynamic lift]], the thrust-to-weight ratio for the whole vehicle must be more than ''one''. In general, the thrust-to-weight ratio is numerically equal to the ''[[g-force]]'' that the vehicle can generate.&lt;ref name="sutton"/&gt; Take-off can occur when the vehicle's ''g-force'' exceeds local gravity (expressed as a multiple of g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).

The thrust to weight ratio of rockets typically greatly exceeds that of [[airbreathing jet engine]]s because the comparatively far greater density of rocket fuel eliminates the need for much engineering materials to pressurize it.

Many factors affect a thrust-to-weight ratio.  The instantaneous value typically varies over the flight with the variations of thrust due to speed and altitude along with the weight due to the remaining propellant and payload mass.  The main factors include freestream air [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[density]], and composition.  Depending on the engine or vehicle under consideration, the actual performance will often be affected by [[buoyancy]] and local [[Field strength#Gravitational field strength|gravitational field strength]].

==Examples==
The [[Russia]]n-made [[RD-180]] rocket engine (which powers [[Lockheed Martin]]’s [[Atlas V]]) produces 3,820&amp;nbsp;kN of sea-level thrust and has a [[Dry matter|dry mass]] of 5,307&amp;nbsp;kg.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Using the Earth surface gravitational field strength of 9.807&amp;nbsp;m/s², the sea-level thrust-to-weight ratio is computed as follows: (1&amp;nbsp;kN = 1000&amp;nbsp;N = 1000&amp;nbsp;kg⋅m/s²)

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{T}{W}=\frac{3,820\ \mathrm{kN}}{(5,307\ \mathrm{kg})(9.807\ \mathrm{m/s^2})}=0.07340\ \frac{\mathrm{kN}}{\mathrm{N}}=73.40\ \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{N}}=73.40&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4360">In [[philosophy]], '''truth by consensus''' is the process of taking statements to be true simply because people generally agree upon them.  [[Imre Lakatos]] characterizes it as a "watered down" form of provable [[truth]] propounded by some [[sociology of knowledge|sociologists of knowledge]], particularly [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Michael Polanyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophical Papers|author=[[Imre Lakatos]]|chapter=Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes|pages=8|year=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter-url=http://www.csun.edu/~vcsoc00i/classes/s680f11/Lakatos.pdf|isbn=978-0-521-28031-0|access-date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Nigel Warburton]] argues that the truth by consensus process is not a reliable way of discovering truth.  That there is general agreement upon something does not make it actually true.&lt;br&gt;
There are two main reasons for this:&lt;ref name=Warburton&gt;{{cite book|title=Thinking from A to Z|author=Nigel Warburton|chapter=truth by consensus|pages=134&amp;ndash;135|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-22281-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# One reason Warburton discusses is that people are prone to wishful thinking.  People can believe an assertion and espouse it as truth in the face of overwhelming evidence and facts to the contrary, simply because they wish that things were so.  
# The other one is that people are gullible, and easily misled.

Another unreliable method of determining truth is by determining the majority opinion of a popular vote.  This is unreliable because on many questions the majority of people are ill-informed.  Warburton gives [[astrology]] as an example of this.  He states that while it may be the case that the majority of the people of the world believe that people's destinies are wholly determined by astrological mechanisms, given that most of that majority have only sketchy and superficial knowledge of the stars in the first place, their views cannot be held to be a significant factor in determining the truth of astrology.  The fact that something "is generally agreed" or that "most people believe" something should be viewed critically, asking the question why that factor is considered to matter at all in an argument over truth.  He states that the simple fact that a majority believes something to be true is unsatisfactory justification for believing it to be true.&lt;ref name=Warburton /&gt;

Warburton makes a distinction between the fallacy of truth by consensus and the process of [[democracy]] in decision-making.  Democracy is preferable to other processes not because it results in truth, but because it provides for equal participation by multiple special-interest groups, and the avoidance of [[tyranny]].&lt;ref name=Warburton /&gt;

Weinberger characterizes [[Jürgen Habermas]] as a proponent of a [[consensus theory of truth]], and criticizes that theory as unacceptable on the following grounds:  First, even if everyone's opinion is in agreement, those opinions may all nonetheless be erroneous.  Second, truth by consensus is conceived as a limit that is approached via an idealized process of discourse; however, it has not been proven that discourse even tends towards such a limit, or that discourse even tends towards ''one single'' limit, and thus it is not proven that truth is the limit that is approached by ideal discourse and consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alternative Action Theory: Simultaneously a Critique of Georg Henrik Von Wright's Practical Philosophy|author=Ota Weinberger|pages=63|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-7923-5184-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12453">The '''International Wages for Housework Campaign''' was a feminist global social movement, which grew out of the International Feminist Collective in [[Italy]] in 1972 and organized resistance and public debate on the social formations produced by gendered labor and [[reproductive labor]], for example domestic work like [[Homemaking|housework]], [[childcare]], [[gender discrimination]], and the socially reinforced performance of [[gender roles]], gendered desire, and leisure inequality. The Campaign's platform included the women's right to work outside of the home, [[Unemployment benefits in Italy|unemployment benefits]], parental leave, and equal pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpdallacosta1.htm|title=The door to the garden|last=www.generation-online.org|first=Mariarosa Dalla Costa + EE + AB|website=www.generation-online.org|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nplusonemag.com" /&gt; The Campaign was formed in [[Padua]], Italy by [[Selma James]], [[Brigitte Galtier]], [[Mariarosa Dalla Costa]], and [[Silvia Federici]]. A major tenet of the campaign was that reproductive labor is the foundation of industrial work, in its important role in the maintenance and care of gendered male workers, yet a type of labor not recognized as productive enough to be [[wage labor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=James|first=Selma|title=Is Transformation Possible? They Say We Can't. We Must|jstor=20838923|journal=Off Our Backs|volume=38|issue=1|page=42|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The demands for the Wages for Housework used [[Marxist]] frameworks to think through the reliance of capitalist economies on exploitative labor practices against certain populations.&lt;ref name="nplusonemag.com"&gt;[http://nplusonemag.com/more-smiles-more-money "More Smiles, More Money." N+1 Magazine. August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mariarosa Dalla Costa]] and some participants in the Wages for Housework campaign were enmeshed in the intellectual movement ''[[operaismo]],'' which developed around factory strikes in [[Northern Italy]] in the 1970s. The Wages for Housework Campaign shared with ''operaismo'' the idea that the fair working conditions including wage is key to the social recognition of labor. ''Operaismo'' encouraged workers to act in their direct interests, and engage in factory strikes to demand better conditions. The Wages for Housework campaign applied also shared discussions about the [[social factory]] with [[operaismo]]; whereby "the whole of society lives as a function of the factory and the factory extends its exclusive domination to the whole of society".&lt;ref name="F&amp;S"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tronti|first1=Mario|title=Factory and Society|url=https://operaismoinenglish.wordpress.com/2013/06/13/factory-and-society/|website=Operaismo in English|accessdate=6 May 2017|date=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign activities included student protests, community workshops, and direct action protest. 

Wages for Housework published a [[autonomist Marxism|Marxist autonomist]] journal, ''Matériaux pour l’intervention.'' Several publications grew out of its ideas, which expanded on the claims of the original group and of more general topics in labor and exploitation. In Italy, ''Quaderni rossi,'' published by [[Raniero Panzieri]], and [[Mario Tronti]], dealt with a variety of topics relating to the class struggle.

==United States==
In 1973, [[Silvia Federici]] helped start Wages for Housework groups in the US and in 1975, the Wages for Housework opened an office in [[Brooklyn]], New York at 288 B. 8th St. The New York group was called the "Wages for Housework Committee."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/permanent-reproductive-crisis-interview-silvia-federici|title = Permanent Reproductive Crisis: An Interview with Silvia Federici|date = March 2013|accessdate = |website = Meta Mute|publisher = Mute|last = Vishmidt|first = Marina}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://bcrw.barnard.edu/archive/sexualhealth/WagesForHousework.pdf Flyers] handed out in support of the New York Wages for Housework Committee [http://bcrw.barnard.edu/archive/workforce/Wages_for_Housework.pdf called for all women] to join regardless of marital status, nationality, sexual orientation, number of children, or employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bcrw.barnard.edu/archive/workforce/Wages_for_Housework.pdf|title = The Campaign for Wages for Housework|date = 1975|accessdate = 22 October 2015|website = bcrw.barnard.edu|publisher = Barnard Center for Research on Women|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 Federici published ''Wages Against Housework,'' the book most commonly associated with the movement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Branches of the Wages for Housework Committee appeared in other cities across America. They were organized in [[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Tulsa]], and [[Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Poor Workers' Union: Rebuilding Labor from Below|last = Tait|first = Vanessa|publisher = South End Press|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0896087149|location = Boston|pages = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these committees, other autonomous organizations that fall within the Wages for Housework campaign began to organize within the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/DOC500_scans/500.020.Wages.for.Housework.pdf|title = The International Wages for Housework Campaign|date = |accessdate = 10 October 2015|website = Freedomarchives.org|publisher = The Freedom Archives|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1974 International Black Women for Wages for Housework was founded by Margaret Prescod and Wilmette Brown in New York City. Prescod also founded the Black Women for Wages for Housework in Los Angeles alongside Sidney Ross-Risden in 1980. The Black Women for Wages for Housework focused on not only unpaid housework for the average housewife, but specific issues of black and third world women. They called for reparations for "slavery, imperialism and neo-colonialism."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-07/news/vw-4294_1_unremunerated-work|title = Waging the War Over Wages: Fight for Homemaker Pay has Seen Ups, Downs|date = May 1987|accessdate = 6 November 2015|website = latimes|publisher = Los Angeles Times|last = Hendrix|first = Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminists Who Changed America, 1963-1975|last = Love|first = Barbara|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0252031892|location = Chicago|pages = 368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1985-07-28/news/vw-5698_1_unpaid-work|title = Campaign Catches On: L.A.

Both San Francisco and Philadelphia were home to Wages Due Lesbians, an organization that was first created in Britain in 1975. Wages Due Lesbians called for wages for housework along with extra wages for lesbians for "the additional physical and emotional housework of surviving in a hostile and prejudiced society, recognized as work and paid for so all women have the economic power to afford sexual choices."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Wages Due Lesbians also worked alongside The Lesbian Mothers' National Defense Fund, founded in 1974 and based in Seattle, which aimed to help lesbian mothers who were a part of custody cases after coming out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.outhistory.org/exhibits/show/lmndf/lmndf|title = The Lesbian Mothers National Defense Fund, the 1970s through 1990s|date = |accessdate = 6 November 2015|website = outhistory.org|publisher = Out History|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The A to Z of the Lesbian Liberation Movement: Still the Rage|last = Myers|first = JoAnne|publisher = Scarecrow Press|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0810863279|location = Plymouth|pages = xxxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

San Francisco was also home to the U.S. PROStitutes Collective (US PROS). US PROS was created in 1982 to help decriminalize prostitution and also prevent men, women, and children from being forced into prostitution.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = US PROS Collective|url = http://uspros.net/|website = US PROS Collective|accessdate = 2015-10-23|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Tulsa housed the No Bad Women, Just Bad Laws Coalitions.

==Social wage campaigns==
Wages for Housework is part of more general [[social wage]] campaigns in the 1970s interested in [[late capitalism]].  These campaigns used analysis of [[Fordist]] compromises during the twentieth century to argue that [[family wages]] or social security payments had amounted to wages paid for housework in the advanced capitalist West.&lt;ref name=Himmelweit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Himmelweit|first=Susan F | last2 = Mohun | first2 = Simon | author-link1 = Susan Himmelweit | title = Domestic labour and capital |journal= Cambridge Journal of Economics |date=1977 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages= 15–31 |url =http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/1/1/15.full.pdf+html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newint.org/features/1988/03/05/wages/ Zoë Fairbairns, "Wages For Housework", ''New Internationalist'', issue 181, March 1988.]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other autonomous organizations interested in compensation for domestic labor were formed in 1975: Black Women for Wages for Housework, Wages Due Lesbians, the [[English Collective of Prostitutes]] (ECP) and some years later WinVisible (women with visible and invisible disabilities).

==Recent history==
In recent years,{{When|date=June 2015}} the demands of the Wages for Housework Campaign have been applied to many more recent debates in the gendered aspects of labor including, reproductive rights, sex work, and demands for women in leadership roles in business.&lt;ref name="nplusonemag.com"/&gt;

Silvia Federici and several others from the early campaign have continued to publish books and articles related to the demands of Wages for Housework including Fererici's 2012 book, ''Revolution at Point Zero: Housework, Reproduction, and Feminist Struggle.''

The '''western lowland gorilla''' (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') is one of two subspecies of the [[western gorilla]] (''Gorilla gorilla'') that lives in [[montane forest|montane]], [[primary forest|primary]] and [[secondary forest]]s and lowland swamps in central Africa in [[Angola]], [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Gabon]]. It is the [[nominate subspecies]] of the western gorilla, and smallest of the four [[gorilla]] subspecies.

The Western lowland gorilla is the only subspecies kept in zoos with the exception of Amahoro, a female [[Eastern lowland gorilla]] at [[Antwerp Zoo]] and a few [[Mountain gorilla]]s kept captive in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref name="Prince-Hughes66"&gt;{{cite book |title= Songs of the Gorilla Nation|last= Prince-Hughes|first= Dawn|authorlink= Dawn Prince-Hughes|year= 1987|publisher= Harmony|location= |isbn=1-4000-5058-8|page= 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Gorilla Male Global.jpg|thumb|left|Skull of a male subject]]
The western lowland gorilla is the smallest subspecies of gorilla but nevertheless still a primate of exceptional size and strength. This species of gorillas exhibits pronounced [[sexual dimorphism]]. They possess no tails and have jet black skin along with coarse black hair that covers their entire body except for the face, ears, hands and feet. The hair on the back and rump of males takes on a grey coloration and is also lost as they get progressively older. This coloration is the reason why older males are known as "silverbacks". Their hands are proportionately large with nails on all digits, similar to that of a human's, and very large thumbs. They have short muzzles, a prominent brow ridge, large nostrils and small eyes and ears. Other features are large muscles in the jaw region along with broad and strong teeth. Among these teeth are strong sets of frontal canines and large molars in the back of the mouth for grinding fruits&lt;ref name="Remis1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Remis|first1=Melissa J.|title=Western lowland gorillas (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') as seasonal frugivores: Use of variable resources|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=43|issue=2|year=1997|pages=87–109|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2345(1997)43:2&lt;87::AID-AJP1&gt;3.0.CO;2-T|pmid=9327094}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vegetables.&lt;ref name="Csomos"&gt;{{cite web|last=Csomos|first=Rebecca Ann|title=Gorilla gorilla western gorilla|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Gorilla_gorilla/#lifespan_longevity|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western gorillas frequently stand upright, but walk in a hunched, quadrupedal fashion, with hands curled and knuckles touching the ground. This style of movement requires long arms, which works for western gorillas because the arm span of gorillas is larger than their standing height.

===Albinism===
[[File:Snowflake - Barcelona Zoo White Gorilla3.jpg|thumb|[[Snowflake (gorilla)|Snowflake]], in the [[Barcelona Zoo]]]]
The only known [[albinism|albino]] gorilla – named [[Snowflake (gorilla)|Snowflake]] – was a wild-born western lowland gorilla originally from [[Equatorial Guinea]]. Snowflake, a male gorilla, was taken from the wild and brought to the [[Barcelona Zoo]] in 1966 at a very young age. Snowflake presented the typical traits and characteristics of albinism typically seen in humans, including white hair, pinkish skin, light colored eyes, reduced [[visual perception]] and [[photophobia]] (discomfort in bright light). Snowflake was diagnosed by scientists as having non-syndromic albinism. The genetic variant for Snowflake’s albinism was identified by the scientists as a non-synonymous [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] located in a [[transmembrane region]] of [[SLC45A2]]. This transporter is also known to be involved in [[oculocutaneous albinism type 4]] in humans. This information revealed the first evidence of [[inbreeding]] in western lowland gorillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prado-Martinez|first=Javier|last2=Hernando-Herraez|first2=Irene|last3=Lorente-Galdos|first3=Belen|last4=Dabad|first4=Marc|last5=Ramirez|first5=Oscar|last6=Baeza-Delgado|first6=Carlos|last7=Morcillo-Suarez|first7=Carlos|last8=Alkan|first8=Can|last9=Hormozdiari|first9=Fereydoun|date=14 January 2013|title=The genome sequencing of an albino Western lowland gorilla reveals inbreeding in the wild|journal=BMC Genomics|volume=14|issue=363|pages=363|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-14-363|pmc=3673836|pmid=23721540|last10=Raineri|first10=Emanuele|last11=Estellé|first11=Jordi|last12=Fernandez-Callejo|first12=Marcos|last13=Valles|first13=Mònica|last14=Ritscher|first14=Lars|last15=Schöneberg|first15=Torsten|last16=de la Calle-Mustienes|first16=Elisa|last17=Casillas|first17=Sònia|last18=Rubio-Acero|first18=Raquel|last19=Melé|first19=Marta|last20=Engelken|first20=Johannes|last21=Caceres|first21=Mario|last22=Gomez-Skarmeta|first22=Jose|last23=Gut|first23=Marta|last24=Bertranpetit|first24=Jaume|last25=Gut|first25=Ivo G|last26=Abello|first26=Teresa|last27=Eichler|first27=Evan E|last28=Mingarro|first28=Ismael|last29=Lalueza-Fox|first29=Carles|last30=Navarro|first30=Arcadi|display-authors=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==

===Social structure===
[[File:Westernlowlandgorilla-ueno2009.ogv|thumb|left|250px|Western lowland gorillas at a [[Ueno Zoo]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan]]

Western lowland gorilla groups travel within a home range averaging {{convert|8|-|45|sqkm|abbr=on|}}. Gorillas do not display territorial behavior, and neighboring groups often overlap ranges.&lt;ref name="Bermejo2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bermejo|first1=M.|title=Home-range use and intergroup encounters in western gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla) at Lossi forest, North Congo|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=64|issue=2|year=2004|pages=223–232|doi=10.1002/ajp.20073|pmid=15470740|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/primat/ebola_workshop/pdf/Bermejo_gorilla_ranging.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doran-SheehyGreer2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doran-Sheehy|first1=Diane M.|last2=Greer|first2=David|last3=Mongo|first3=Patrice|last4=Schwindt|first4=Dylan|title=Impact of ecological and social factors on ranging in western gorillas|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=64|issue=2|year=2004|pages=207–222|doi=10.1002/ajp.20075|pmid=15470743|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/primat/ebola_workshop/pdf/Doran_mondika_ranging_paper.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group usually favours a certain area within the home range but seems to follow a seasonal pattern depending upon the availability of ripening fruits and, at some sites, localised large open clearings (swamps and "bais"). Gorillas normally travel {{convert|3|-|5|km|abbr=on}} per day. Populations feeding on high-energy foods that vary spatially and seasonally tend to have greater day ranges than those feeding on lower-quality but more consistently available foods. Larger groups travel greater distances in order to obtain sufficient food.&lt;ref name="Remis1997"/&gt;

It was found that it is easier for males to travel alone and move between groups as a result of the solidarity they experienced before finding their own breeding group. Before reaching the age of sexual maturity, males leave their natal group and go through a “bachelor stage” that can last several years either in solitary or in a nonbreeding group.&lt;ref name=Douadi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Douadi|first=Melanie|title=Sex-biased dispersal in western lowland gorillas (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'')|journal=Molecular Ecology|date=June 2007|volume=16|issue=11|pages=2247–2259|pmid=17561888|last2=Gatti|first2=S|last3=Levrero|first3=F|last4=Duhamel|first4=G|last5=Bermejo|first5=M|last6=Vallet|first6=D|last7=Menard|first7=N|last8=Petit|first8=E. J.|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03286.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while both sexes leave their birth group, females are never found alone; they just travel from breeding group to breeding group. It was also found that males like to settle with other male members of their family. Their breeding groups consist of one silverback male, three adult females and their offspring.&lt;ref name=Douadi/&gt; The male gorilla takes on the role of the protector. Females tend to make bonds with other females in their natal group only, but rather form strong bonds with males. Males also compete aggressively with each other for contact with females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Maestripieri, Dario |author2=Ross, Stephen |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Sex differences in play among western lowland gorilla (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') infants: Implications for adult behavior and social structure|journal= American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume= 123|issue=1 |year=2004|pages= 52–61|doi=10.1002/ajpa.10295|pmid=14669236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group of gorillas is led by one or more adult males. In cases where there are more than one silverback males in a group, they are most likely father and son. Groups containing only one male are believed to be the basic unit of the social group, gradually growing in size due to reproduction and new members migrating in. In the study done at Lope, gorillas harvest most of their food arboreally, but less than half of their night nests are built in trees.&lt;ref&gt;Tutin, Caroline. "Ranging and social structure of lowland gorillas in the Lope Reserv, Gabon." Great Ape Societies. (1996): 58–70. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They are often found on the ground and are made up of up to 30 gorillas. Western lowland gorillas live in the smallest family groups of all gorillas, with an average of 4 to 8 members in each. The leader (the silverback) organizes group activities, like eating, nesting and travelling in their home range. Those who challenge this alpha male are apt to be cowed by impressive shows of physical power. He may stand upright, throw things, make aggressive charges, and pound his huge chest with open or cupped hands while barking out powerful hoots or unleashing a frightening roar. Despite these displays and the animals' obvious physical power, gorillas are generally calm and nonaggressive unless they are disturbed. Young gorillas, from three to six years old, remind human observers of children. Much of their day is spent in play, climbing trees, chasing one another and swinging from branches.&lt;ref name="animals.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/lowland-gorilla/|title=Western Lowland Gorilla|work=National Geographic|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
Female western lowland gorillas do not produce many offspring due to the fact that they do not reach sexual maturity until the age of 8 or 9.&lt;ref name="Western Lowland Gorilla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcs.org/saving-wildlife/great-apes/western-lowland-gorillas.aspx|title=Western Lowland Gorilla|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female gorillas give birth to one infant after a gestation period of nearly nine months. Female gorillas do not show signs of pregnancy. Unlike their powerful parents, newborns are tiny—weighing four pounds—and able only to cling to their mothers' fur. These infants ride on their mothers' backs from the age of four months through the first two or three years of their lives.&lt;ref name="animals.nationalgeographic.com" /&gt; Infants can be dependent on their mother for up to five years.&lt;ref name="Western Lowland Gorilla" /&gt;

A study of over 300 births to captive female gorillas revealed that older females tend to give birth to more male offspring as opposed to females under 8 years old. This pattern is likely to result from selective pressures on females to have males at a time when they can provision them most effectively, as male reproductive success probably varies more than that of females and depends more on the maternal role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1990|title=Birth Sex Ratio and Infant Mortality Rates in Captive Western Lowland Gorillas|journal=Folia Primatologica|volume=55|issue=3–4|pages=156|doi=10.1159/000156511|author=Mace, G.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ZOO Praha - Moja 03.jpg|thumb|right|A young western lowland gorilla at [[Prague Zoo|Praha Zoo]]]]
Female western lowland gorillas living in a group led by a single male have been observed to display sexual behavior during all stages of their reproductive cycle and during times of non-fertility. Three out of four females have been observed to engaged in sexual behavior while pregnant and two out of three females have been observed to engage in sexual behavior while lactating. Females are significantly more likely to engage and participate in sexual behavior and activity on a day when another female is sexually active. It has been found that female western lowland gorillas participate in non-reproductive sexual behavior in order to increase her reproductive success through sexual competition. By increasing the female’s own reproductive success, she then decreases the reproductive success of others female gorillas, regardless of their reproductive state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoinski|first=Tara|date=July 2009|title=Sexual behavior in female western lowland gorillas (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla''): evidence for sexual competition|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=71|issue=7|pages=587–593|doi=10.1002/ajp.20692|pmid=19399838|author2=Bonnie Perdue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infanticide has occasionally been observed within the species. Infanticide is when an adult male gorilla kills an infant gorilla. Victims are never related to the killer. A male does this in order to have the opportunity to mate with the mother, who otherwise would have been unavailable while caring for her young offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stokes |first1=Emma J |last2=Parnell |first2=Richard J |last3=Olejniczak |first3=Claudia |title=Female dispersal and reproductive success in wild western lowland gorillas (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |date=1 September 2003 |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=329–339 |doi=10.1007/s00265-003-0630-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligence==

===Use of tools===
Their intelligence is displayed through their ability to fashion natural materials into tools that help them gather food more conveniently. While the use and manufacture of tools to extract ants and termites is a well-documented behavior in wild chimpanzees, it has never been observed in other great apes in their natural habitat and never seen to be done by other primates in captivity.
[[File:Gorilla tool use.png|thumb|A female gorilla measuring depth of water with a branch at [[Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park]], northern [[Republic of the Congo]], an example of tool use]]
In terms of manufacturing tools for the use of extracting for western lowland gorillas, gorillas are able to adapt tools to a particular use by selecting branches, removing projections such as leaves and bark and adapting their length to the depth of the holes. It appears that they also anticipate the use of the tool since they begin with biggest sticks available and progressively modify it until it is the perfect fit for inserting into a hole that contains food. This demonstrates the gorillas' acquisition of high level sensorimotor intelligence similar to that of young human children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pouydebat|first=Emmanuelle|author2=Berge, Christine |author3=Gorce, Philippe |title=Use and Manufacture of Tools to Extract Food by Captive ''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'': Experimental Approach|journal=Folia Primatologica|year=2004|volume=76|issue=3|pages=180–183|doi=10.1159/000084381|last4=Coppens|first4=Yves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, there was a gorilla that used a stick to measure the depth of water. In 2009, a western lowland gorilla at [[Buffalo Zoological Gardens]] used a bucket to collect water. In an experiment, one adult male gorilla and three adult female gorillas were given five-gallon buckets near a standing pool. Two of the younger females were able to fill the buckets with water. This is the first record of gorillas spontaneously using tools to drink in zoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kleinfelder III|first1=Raymond E.|last2=Margulis|first2=Susan W.|last3=Steele|first3=Gary R.|title=Use of Buckets as Tools by Western Lowland Gorillas|doi=10.1002/zoo.21001|pmid=22290615|volume=31|journal=Zoo Biol|pages=260–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
Another example of gorillas' significant intelligence is their ability to comprehend simple sign language.&lt;ref name="animals.nationalgeographic.com" /&gt; In the mid-1970s, researchers turned their attention to communicating with gorillas via sign language. One gorilla, [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]], was born in [[San Francisco Zoo]] on July 4, 1971. A woman named [[Francine Patterson]] officially started working with Koko on July 12, 1972, with the goal of teaching her sign language. In the beginning, Dr. Petterson focused on teaching Koko only three basic signs: "food", "drink", and "more". Koko would learn signs through observation, Dr. Patterson, or one of her colleagues by molding Koko's hands into the correct sign. On August 7, Patterson began a more formal routine of teaching Koko the signs, "food", "drink", and "more". In the couple weeks before that, Koko had been using gestures that seemed like attempts at the signs taught, but were deemed as coincidental and random and not intended for the actual purpose. Only two days after they started the more formal routine, Koko started responding consistently with the sign "food" when prompted to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Education of Koko|last=Patterson|first=Francine|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|year=1981|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first three months, Koko made 16 different combinations of signs and was also starting to form simple questions by using eye contact and different positioning of signs by the body. Koko mastered more than 1,000 signs and was said to be able to connect up to 8 words together to form a statement expressing wants, needs, thoughts, or simple responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanly|first=Elizabeth|date=June 18, 2004|title=LISTENING TO KOKO|url=|journal=Commonweal|volume= 131| issue = 12|pages=pgs 14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koko passed away, in her sleep, at [[The Gorilla Foundation]] in Woodside, California on June 19, 2018 at the age of 46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Elkin |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Ahmed |first2=Saeed |title=Koko, the gorilla who mastered sign language, has died |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/21/health/koko-gorilla-death-trnd/index.html |accessdate=2018-08-25 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a study examining the ability of western lowland gorillas to give to and exchange with humans. This involved humans holding objects such as fruit, leaves or peanuts in one hand. Once the gorillas had given twigs to the humans, they would receive one of these objects. If the gorillas did not give them a twig, they would not get their desired object. The gorillas were shown to quickly learn about receiving rewards as mistakes made by the gorillas in the beginning of the experiments gradually decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02557563|title=Exchange of objects between humans and captive western lowland gorillas|journal=Primates|volume=39|issue=4|pages=389|year=1998|last1=Chalmeau|first1=Raphaël|last2=Peignot|first2=Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the mental capacity of western lowland gorillas continue.

==Ecology==

===Habitat===
Western lowland gorillas primarily live in rain forests, swamp forest, brush, secondary vegetation, clearing and forest edges, abandoned farming fields and riverine forests. They live in primary and secondary lowland tropical forests that have elevations that extend from sea level up to 1,300 meters. The average amount of rainfall in the areas where western lowland gorillas typically reside is about 1,500 millimetres a year with the greatest rainfall between the months of August and November. Western lowland gorillas are not typically observed in areas that are close to human settlements and villages. They have been known to avoid areas with roads and farms that show signs of human activity. These gorillas favor areas where edible plants are more copious. Swamp forests are now considered important feeding areas and habitats for the western lowland gorilla. These areas support the gorillas in both the wet and the dry season of the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yog2009.org/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=46%3Agorillaspecies&amp;id=63%3Awlgspeciesinfo&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=70|title=Western Lowland Gorillas|publisher=YoG|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914094937/http://www.yog2009.org/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=46%3Agorillaspecies&amp;id=63%3Awlgspeciesinfo&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=70|archivedate=14 September 2011|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forests of the Republic of Congo are currently considered to host the majority of the western lowland gorilla population. The forests of the Republic of Congo serve as protection to the gorillas with the isolation of the large swampy forest areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/great_apes/gorillas/western_lowland_gorilla/|title=Western lowland gorilla|publisher=WWF Global|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet===
As primarily herbivores, the main diet of western lowland gorilla groups is roots, shoots, fruit, wild celery, tree bark and pulp which is provided for in the thick forests of central and west Africa.&lt;ref name="animals.nationalgeographic.com" /&gt; During the wet season gorillas commonly consume fruits. While in the dry season, there is a decrease in the consumption of fleshy fruits, but they still continue to eat other kinds of fruits. The diversity of fruits consumed was higher in the poor fruit year,when favored fruit species, failed to produce large crops.&lt;ref name="Remis1997"/&gt; They may also eat insects from time to time. The common food item within fibers are the herbaceous stems.&lt;ref name="Remis1997"/&gt; Important food species have been divided into three categories. Staple foods which are eaten on a daily/weekly basis throughout the year, seasonal foods which are present in the majority of resources when available and fallback foods which are always available, but eaten only or mainly during fruit-scarce months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=M.

E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorillas will climb trees up to 15 meters in height in search of food. They never completely strip vegetation from a single area since the rapid regrowth of the vegetation allows them to stay within a reasonably confined home range for extended periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Gorilla_gorilla/#lifespan_longevity|title=Gorilla gorilla western gorilla|last=Csomos|first=Rebecca Ann|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western lowland gorilla eats a combination of fruits and foliage, providing a balance of nutrients, depending on the time of year. However, when ripe fruit is available, they tend to eat more fruit as opposed to foliage. When ripe fruit is in scarce supply, they eat leaves, herbs and bark. During the rainy months of July and August, fruit is ripe; however, in the dry seasons, ripe fruit is scarce. Gorillas choose fruit that is high in sugar for energy, as well as fibre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Dierenfeld|first2=E. S.|last3=Mowry|first3=C. B.|last4=Carroll|first4=R.

J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with humans==
The presence of western lowland gorillas has allowed humans to further the study of how gorillas compare with humans in regards to human diseases, behavior, linguistic and psychological aspects of their lives. They are hunted illegally for their skins and meat in Africa and captured to be sold to zoos. While defended as being economically profitable for restaurants and local people, it is a large contributor to the endangered status of the western lowland gorilla. They are also seen as a crop pest in western Africa because they raid native plantations and therefore destroy what would have otherwise been valuable crops.&lt;ref name="Csomos"/&gt;

===Threats===

====Hunting and logging====
In tropical forests, gorillas are hunted to provide meat for the bushmeat trade. Logging also destroys gorilla habitats. Although logging diminishes gorilla habitats, it may also provide for increased herbaceous vegetation as a result of gaps in the tree cover. Destruction of gorilla habitat may harm the overall forest ecosystem. Western lowland gorillas are seed dispersers, which mean they carry seeds from one place to another, and this trait is beneficial to many of the animals in the forest. Therefore, if there are no western lowland gorillas to disperse the needed seeds to other animals, not only will the gorillas become extinct but so will many other animals, which could over time destroy an entire ecosystem.&lt;ref name="impact"&gt;{{cite journal|last-author-amp=yes|year=2013|title=Impacts of logging and hunting on western lowland gorilla (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') populations and consequences for forest regeneration.

====Population decline and recovery====
[[File:Western Lowland Gorilla at Bronx Zoo 4.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Western lowland gorilla at Bronx Zoo|[[Bronx Zoo]]]]
The western lowland gorilla population in the wild is faced by a number of factors that threaten its extinction. Such factors include deforestation, farming, grazing and the expanding human settlements that cause forest loss. There is a correlation between human intervention in the wild with the destruction of habitats and increase in bushmeat hunting.&lt;ref name="animals.nationalgeographic.com" /&gt; Another of these factors is infertility. Generally, female gorillas mature at 10–12 years of age (or earlier at 7–8 years) and their male counterparts mature more slowly, rarely strong and dominant enough to reproduce before 15–20 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/gorilla/reproduction.htm|title=GORILLAS- Reproduction|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fecundity]] of females, or capacity of producing young in great numbers, appears to decline by the age of 18. Of one half of captive females of viable reproductive age, approximately only 30% of those had only a single birth. However, these non-reproductive gorillas may prove to be a valuable resource since the use of assisted reproductive techniques aid in the maintaining of genetic diversity in the limited populations in zoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatasaka|first=Harry H.|date=February 1997|title=Strategies for ovulation induction and oocyte retrieval in the lowland gorilla|journal=Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics|volume=14|issue=2|pages=102–110|doi=10.1007/bf02765779|pmc=3454829|pmid=9048241|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===
[[File:Flachlandgorilla mit Baby.JPG|thumb|right|Female western lowland gorilla with her baby, born at this day at [[Durrell Wildlife Park]]]]
In the 1980s, a census of the gorilla populations in equatorial [[Africa]] was thought to be 100,000. Researchers later adjusted the figure to less than half because of poaching and diseases.&lt;ref name="wcs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wcs.org/news-and-features-main/motherlode-of-gorillas-discovered-in-central-africa.aspx|title=Motherlode of Gorillas Discovered in Central Africa|date=5 August 2008|publisher=[[Wildlife Conservation Society]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65k99YIRS|archivedate=26 February 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys conducted by the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] in 2006 and 2007 found about 125,000 previously unreported gorillas have been living in the swamp forests of [[Lake Télé Community Reserve]] and in neighboring [[Marantaceae]] (dryland) forests in the Republic of the Congo. However, gorillas remain vulnerable to [[Ebola]], [[deforestation]] and [[poaching]].&lt;ref name="wcs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2008-08-05/world/congo.gorillas_1_gorillas-researchers-congolese?_s=PM:WORLD|title=More than 100,000 rare gorillas found in Congo|date=5 August 2008|publisher=CNN|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65k9ABWt7|archivedate=26 February 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 and 2003, there was an Ebola outbreak in the Lossi sanctuary population, and in 2004, there was an Ebola outbreak in the Lokoué forest clearing in [[Odzala-Kokoua National Park]], both in the Republic of the Congo. The Ebola outbreak in the Lokoué forest clearing negatively affected the individuals living in groups and the adult females more than the solitary males, resulting in an increase in the proportion of solitary males to those living in groups. This population decreased from 377 individuals to 38 individuals two years after the outbreak and to 40 individuals six years after the outbreak. The population is still slowly recovering, even today, it is hoped towards a population that has the same demographic structure of an unaffected population, because of new births and breeding groups. This Ebola outbreak also affected the Maya Nord population (52 kilometres northwest from Lokoué) from 400 individuals to considerably fewer. Because of these outbreaks, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) updated the status of western lowland gorillas from "endangered" to "critically endangered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Genton|first=Céline|year=2012|title=Recovery Potential of a Western Lowland Gorilla Population following a Major Ebola Outbreak: Results from a Ten Year Study|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=5|pages=e37106|bibcode=2012PLoSO...737106G|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0037106|pmc=3359368|pmid=22649511|author2=Cristescu, Romane|author3=Gatti, Sylvain|author4=Levréro, Florence|author5=Bigot, Elodie|author6=Caillaud, Damien|author7=Pierre, Jean-Sébastien|author8=Ménard, Nelly|author9=Hayward, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the northeastern part of the Republic of the Congo, even though poaching is illegal, western lowland gorillas are still being hunted for their bushmeat and the young for pets; five percent of the species is killed each year because of this. Deforestation of this area allows for the trade of bushmeat and even more poaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldwildlife.org/species/western-lowland-gorilla "Western Lowland Gorilla."] World Wildlife Fund. Ed. Matthew Lewis and Richard Carroll. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial poaching of chimpanzees, forest elephants and western gorillas in The Republic of the Congo resulted from the increased amount of commercial logging and infrastructure. Deforestation and logging allowed for the creation of roads which allowed hunters to hunt deeper into the forests, increasing the amount of poaching and bushmeat trade in the area. The Republic of the Congo has put in place a conservation effort to conserve different species such as chimpanzees, forest elephants and western gorillas from poaching and deforestation. This conservation effort would allow these species to benefit from vegetation and ecologically important resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last3=Bakabana|first3=Parfait C.|last4=Elkan|first4=Paul W.|last5=Iyenguet|first5=Fortuné C.|last6=Madzoké|first6=Bola|last7=Malanda|first7=Guy Aimé F.|last8=Mowawa|first8=Brice S.|last9=Moukoumbou|first9=Calixte|year=2010|title=Monitoring Great Ape and Elephant Abundance at Large Spatial Scales: Measuring Effectiveness of a Conservation Landscape|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=5|issue=4|pages=e10294|bibcode=2010PLoSO...510294S|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010294|pmc=2859051|pmid=20428233|author12=Getz, Wayne M.|last1=Stokes|first1=Emma J.|author2=Strindberg, Samantha|last10=Ouakabadio|first10=Franck K.|last11=Rainey|first11=Hugo J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush meat hunting and timber harvesting in the western lowland gorilla’s habitat have negatively affected the probability of its survival. The western lowland gorilla is considered to be critically endangered by the IUCN. The western lowland gorillas, like many gorillas, are essential to the composition of the rainforest due to their seed distribution.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt; The conservation of the Western Lowland gorilla has been made a priority by many organizations. The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has been working with the local community in the Congo Basin to establish wildlife management programs. The WCS is also working in Congo and surrounding countries to limit the bush meat trade by enforcing laws and hunting restrictions and also helping the local people find new sources of protein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcs.org/saving-wildlife/great-apes/western-lowland-gorillas.aspx "Western Lowland Gorilla."] – Saving Wildlife.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoos worldwide have a population of 550 western lowland gorillas, and the [[Cincinnati Zoo]] leads the United States in western lowland gorilla births.&lt;ref name="Prince-Hughes66" /&gt;

==In captivity==

===Stress===
Stress has been known to cause both physiological and behavioral chronic issues for captive species including, but not limited to, altered reproductive cycling and behavior, reduced immune responses, disrupted hormone and growth levels, reduced body weight, heightened abnormal activities and aggression and decreased exploratory behavior with increased hiding behaviors.&lt;ref name="Morgan2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morgan | first1 = K | last2 = Tromborg | first2 = C | year = 2007 | title = Sources of stress in captivity | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 102 | issue = 3–4| pages = 262–302 | doi = 10.1016/j.applanim.2006.05.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such stress reactions could be caused by sounds, light conditions, odors, temperature and humidity conditions, material make-up of enclosures, habitat size constraints, lack of proper hiding areas, forced closeness to humans, routine husbandry and feeding conditions, or abnormal social groups to name a few.&lt;ref name="Morgan2007"/&gt; Use of both internal and external privacy screens on exhibit windows has been shown to alleviate stresses from visual effects of high crowd densities, leading to decreased stereotypic behaviors in the gorillas.&lt;ref name="Clark2011" /&gt; Playing naturalistic auditory stimuli as opposed to classical music, rock music, or no auditory enrichment (which allows for crowd noise, machinery, etc. to be heard) has been noted to reduce stress behavior as well.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins L, Margulis S. The effects of auditory enrichment on gorillas. Zoo Biology. 2014 [accessed 2015 Oct 12];33(3):197–203.&lt;/ref&gt; Enrichment modifications to feed and foraging, where clover-hay is added to an exhibit floor, decrease stereotypic activities while simultaneously increasing positive food-related behaviors.&lt;ref name="Clark2011" /&gt;

===Stereotypic behaviors===
[[Stereotypy (non-human)|Stereotypic behaviors]] are abnormal or compulsive behaviors. In captive gorillas, such common aberrant behaviors include eating disorders—such as regurgitation, reingestion and [[coprophagy]]—self injurious or conspecific aggression, pacing, rocking, sucking of fingers or lip smacking, and overgrooming &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = D.L. | year = 2005 | title = A note on the influence of visitors on the behaviour and welfare of zoo-housed gorillas | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 93 | issue = | pages = 13–17 | doi = 10.1016/j.applanim.2005.06.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative vigilance of visitor behaviors have been identified as starting, posturing and charging at visitors.&lt;ref name="Clark2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clark | first1 = F | last2 = Fitzpatrick | first2 = M | last3 = Hartley | first3 = A | last4 = King | first4 = A | last5 = Lee | first5 = T | last6 = Routh | first6 = A | last7 = Walker | first7 = S | last8 = George | first8 = K | year = 2011 | title = Relationship between behavior, adrenal activity, and environment in zoo-housed western lowland gorillas (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') | url = | journal = Zoo Biology | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 306–321 | doi = 10.1002/zoo.20396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups of bachelor gorillas containing young silverbacks have significantly higher levels of aggression and wounding rates than mixed age and sex groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leeds | first1 = A | last2 = Boyer | first2 = D | last3 = Ross | first3 = S | last4 = Lukas | first4 = K | year = 2015 | title = The effects of group type and young silverbacks on wounding rates in western lowland gorilla (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') groups in North American zoos | url = | journal = Zoo Biology | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 296–304 | doi = 10.1002/zoo.21218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular abnormal behavior is hair-plucking, which occurs across many species of mammals and birds. Studies made on the topic show that of all the western lowland gorillas housed in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) population, 15% of the surveyed population displayed hair-plucking behavior with 62% of all institutions housing a hair-plucker. Individual gorillas, particularly those of a more solitary nature, are more likely to self-pluck using their fingers and pick up this behavior if they were exposed to a group member that plucked their hair as a youngster and not yet mature gorilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Less |first=E.

Recent research on captive gorilla welfare emphasizes a need to shift to individual assessments instead of a one size fits all group approach to understanding how welfare increases or decreases based on a variety of factors.&lt;ref name="Stoinski2011"/&gt; Individual characteristics such as age, sex, personality and individual histories are essential in understanding that stressors will affect each individual gorilla and their [[animal welfare|welfare]] differently.&lt;ref name="Clark2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoinski2011"/&gt;

Despite the chimpanzees being the closest extant relatives of humans, 15% of the human genome was found to be more like that of the gorilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/07/us-gorilla-genome-sheds-new-light-human-idUSTRE8261VA20120307|title=Gorilla genome sheds new light on human evolution|date=7 March 2012|author=Kelland, Kate|agency=Reuters|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 30% of the gorilla genome "is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other; this is rarer around coding genes, indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution, and has functional consequences in gene expression".&lt;ref name=Scally/&gt; Analysis of the gorilla genome has cast doubt on the idea that the rapid evolution of hearing genes gave rise to language in humans, as it also occurred in gorillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/gorilla-joins-the-genome-club-1.10185|title=Gorilla joins the genome club|date=7 March 2012|publisher=Nature News|author=Smith, Kerri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in 2013, a study was conducted in order to better understand the genetic variation in gorillas by using reduced representation sequencing. This study consisted of a sample of 12 western lowland gorillas and two eastern lowland gorillas all in captivity. The study found that western lowland gorillas are more likely to be heterozygous than homozygous. Most pure (meaning they are not inbred) western lowland gorillas have a hom/het ratio that ranges from 0.5 to 0.7. Therefore, because of variation in these gorillas, it has been concluded that they display a moderate substructure within the western lowland population in general.

Finally, the study sought out to analyze the allele frequency spectrum (AFS) in western lowland gorillas. The reason why is that AFS knowledge can help give information regarding demographics and evolutionary processes. The AFS has determined that western lowland gorillas display a deficit of rare alleles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler-Smith|first=Chris|last2=Yngvadottir|first2=Bryndis|last3=Xue|first3=Yali|last4=Ayub|first4=Qasim|last5=Durbin|first5=Richard|last6=Tyler-Smith|first6=Chris|date=June 2013|title=A Genome-Wide Survey of Genetic Variation in Gorillas Using Reduced Representation Sequencing|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=6|pages=1–9|bibcode=2013PLoSO...865066S|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0065066|pmc=3672199|pmid=23750230|arxiv=1301.1729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease==
Western lowland gorillas are believed to be one of the [[zoonotic]] origins of [[HIV/AIDS]]. The SIV or [[Simian immunodeficiency virus]] that infects them is similar to a certain strain of HIV-1.&lt;ref name="VanHeuv"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Li|first2=Yingying|last3=Neel|first3=Cecile|last4=Bailes|first4=Elizabeth|last5=Keele|first5=Brandon F.|last6=Liu|first6=Weimin|last7=Loul|first7=Severin|last8=Butel|first8=Christelle|last9=Liegeois|first9=Florian|year=2006|title=Human immunodeficiency viruses: SIV infection in wild gorillas|journal=Nature|volume=444|issue=7116|page=164|bibcode=2006Natur.444..164V|doi=10.1038/444164a|pmid=17093443|last1=Van Heuverswyn|first1=Fran|last10=Bienvenue|first10=Yanga|last11=Ngolle|first11=Eitel Mpoudi|last12=Sharp|first12=Paul M.|last13=Shaw|first13=George M.|last14=Delaporte|first14=Eric|last15=Hahn|first15=Beatrice H.|last16=Peeters|first16=Martine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plantier"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Leoz|first2=Marie|last3=Dickerson|first3=Jonathan E|last4=De Oliveira|first4=Fabienne|last5=Cordonnier|first5=François|last6=Lemée|first6=VéRonique|last7=Damond|first7=Florence|last8=Robertson|first8=David L|last9=Simon|first9=François|year=2009|title=A new human immunodeficiency virus derived from gorillas|journal=Nature Medicine|volume=15|issue=8|pages=871–72|doi=10.1038/nm.2016|pmid=19648927|last1=Plantier|first1=Jean-Christophe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharp2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bailes|first2=E.|last3=Chaudhuri|first3=R.

This clustering allows us to pinpoint the probable geographic origins of two of the human virus clades. In the southern part of Cameroon, the populations of western lowland gorillas have had examinations of their feces. Out of 2,934 gorilla samples, 70 reacted with at least one HIV-1 antigen. These samples came from four field sites, all located in southern Cameroon.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'arc|first=Mirela|last2=Ayouba|first2=Ahidjo|last3=Esteban|first3=Amandine|last4=Learn|first4=Gerald H.|last5=Boué|first5=Vanina|last6=Liegeois|first6=Florian|last7=Etienne|first7=Lucie|last8=Tagg|first8=Nikki|last9=Leendertz|first9=Fabian H.|date=2015|title=Origin of the HIV-1 group O epidemic in western lowland gorillas|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=112|issue=11|pages=E1343–E1352|bibcode=2015PNAS..112E1343D|doi=10.1073/pnas.1502022112|pmc=4371950|pmid=25733890|url=http://www.documentation.ird.fr/hor/fdi:010064059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of AIDS has been linked to a virus known to infect more than 40 species of nonhuman primates in Africa. HIV-1, is composed of four phylogenetic lineages, which at some point in time have independently gone through cross-species transmission of the SIV (simian immune-deficiency virus). The simian immunodeficiency virus infected various African primates such as apes, gorillas and chimpanzees.&lt;ref name="origin" /&gt;

Disease has also been a factor in the survival of the western lowland gorilla. The Ebola epizootic in western and central Africa has caused more than 90% mortality rate in western lowland gorillas. From 2003–2004, two epizootics infected the western lowland gorilla, which caused two thirds of their population to disappear. The outbreak was monitored in the Republic of Congo by [[Magdalena Bermejo]] and other field-based primatologists, as it also spread to humans through contact with bushmeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2009|title=How Ebola Impacts Genetics of Western Lowland Gorilla Populations|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=4|issue=12|pages=e8375|bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.8375L|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0008375|pmc=2791222|pmid=20020045|author1=Le Gouar, Pascaline|author2=Vallet, Dominique|author3=David, Laetitia|author4=Bermejo, Magdalena|author5=Gatti, Sylvain}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catastrophe led the World Conservation Union to designate the western lowland gorilla a critically endangered species. [[Malaria]] is also an issue that has been arising for the western lowland gorillas. Out of 51 faecal samples from habituated individuals, 25 were shown to have ''[[Plasmodium]]'' DNA. ''[[Laverania]]'', which is a subgenus of the parasitic [[protozoa]]n genus ''Plasmodium'', was found in these studies. Varying exposure to different ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes transmitting ''Plasmodium'' species is known to be the origin of malaria in western lowland gorillas.

Wild western lowland gorillas are known to consume the seeds of the [[Aframomum melegueta#Uses|"grains of paradise"]] plant, apparently conferring healthy cardiovascular conditions from their consumption — the occasionally poor cardiovascular health of lowland gorillas in zoos has been postulated to be due to the lack of availability of the ''[[Aframomum]]'' seeds in zoo gorillas' diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asknature.org/strategy/23ec7287a4207c835d8bf162ff26afcb|title=Gorilla diet protects heart: grains of paradise|date=20 February 2012|publisher=Asknature.org|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult male gorillas are prone to [[cardiomyopathy]], a degenerative [[heart disease]].&lt;ref name="Schulman"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schulman|first=F.

He was of African American, Northern European, and Cherokee Indian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Head|first=Wilson|title= A Life on the Edge: Experiences in Black and White in North America |publisher=University of Toronto Press|date= 1995| isbn=0-9680066-0-4|at= Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in deep poverty in the small black community of Milner, near Atlanta. His father died when he was 11, but his mother stressed the importance of education, telling him he would have to be "twice as smart as whites to compete".&lt;ref name="OBITUARY"&gt;''The Globe and Mail'', Toronto, Ont, Canada.

C.1&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson worked to put himself through school, graduating from [[Booker T. Washington High School (Atlanta, Georgia)|Booker T. Washington High School]] in 1933 and, after taking two years to work and save the fees, graduated from [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]], [[Tuskegee, Alabama]] in 1940 with a Bachelor of Science in Education, by which time he had been named in Who's Who Among Students in American Universities and Colleges, 1939–40.

'''Åke Green''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈoːkɛ ˈɡreːn|lang}}; born 3 June 1941) is a Swedish [[Pentecostal]] [[Christian]] pastor who was prosecuted, but [[acquitted]], under Sweden's law against [[hate speech]] because of critical opinions on [[homosexuality]] in his [[sermon]]s. The [[Judicial system of Sweden#Courts|district court]] found him guilty and sentenced him to one month in prison. The sentence was appealed to the court of appeals ([[hovrätt]]). On 11 February 2005, the [[Göta Court of Appeal]] overturned the decision and acquitted Åke Green. On 9 March, the [[Prosecutor-General of Sweden|Prosecutor-General]] (''Riksåklagaren'') appealed this decision to the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]], which on 29 November also acquitted.

The Supreme Court stated that Åke Green had violated Swedish law as it currently stands regarding agitation against groups, and that the constitutionally guaranteed [[freedom of expression]] as well as [[freedom of religion]] does not protect him. However, the  Supreme Court also stated that the  [[freedom of expression]] as well as [[freedom of religion]] provided by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which is superior to normal Swedish law according to the lex superior principle regarding the [[ECHR]] found in the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) 2:19, gives him protection, since  jurisprudence  shows that a conviction would probably not be upheld by the [[European Court of Justice|European Court]].&lt;ref name="TheLocal29"&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/2590/20051129/ The Local, 29 Nov 2005: Åke Green cleared over gay sermon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SupCourt"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120218220008/http://www.domstol.se/Domstolar/hogstadomstolen/Avgoranden/2005/Dom_pa_engelska_B_1050-05.pdf Judgment of the Supreme court of Sweden]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/pressmeddelanden.htm |title=Supreme court press release 2005-11-29 (In Swedish) |accessdate=2006-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217161725/http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/pressmeddelanden.htm |archivedate=17 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 2002, the [[Riksdag]] included references to sexual orientation in a list of groups protected against persecution in the form of threats and expressions of disdain. The list appears in a section of Swedish [[criminal law]] (''Brottsbalken'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweden.gov.se/content/1/c4/15/36/d74ceabc.pdf The Swedish Penal Code (English), chapter 16, section 8]&lt;/ref&gt; known as The Act on Agitation Against a National or Ethnic Group (''Lagen om hets mot folkgrupp'').

== The sermon ==
At his church in [[Borgholm]], Green delivered a sermon&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eaec.org/bibleanswers/ake_green_sermon.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in which he described "sexual perversions" (referencing homosexuality) as "abnormal, a horrible [[cancer]]ous [[tumor]] in the body of society."  He also said that a person cannot be a Christian and a homosexual at the same time.

Green had invited members of the media to attend the sermon, but none were present when he preached it in the presence of about fifty listeners. He wrote a summary of the sermon, including the above-mentioned quotes, which was printed in the local newspaper Ölandsbladet. A representative of nearby [[Kalmar]]'s [[RFSL]], an [[LGBT]] equal rights organization, reported the sermon to the police and the controversy began.&lt;ref&gt;Den svenska politiken - Struktur, processer och resultat. Henry Bäck, Torbjörn Larsson, 2006. p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The [[Judicial system of Sweden#Courts|district court]] found Åke Green guilty and sentenced him to one month in prison. The sentence was appealed to the court of appeals ([[hovrätt]]) and Green's lawyer maintained his client's religious freedom had been violated. On 11 February 2005 Göta hovrätt overturned the decision and acquitted Åke Green. On 9 March, the [[Prosecutor-General of Sweden|Prosecutor-General]] (''Riksåklagaren'') appealed this decision to the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]], which on 29 November also acquitted him.

The Supreme Court stated that Åke Green had violated Swedish hate speech law (''Lagen om hets mot folkgrupp'').  A conviction would probably not be upheld by the [[European Court of Human Rights|European Court]]&lt;ref name="TheLocal29"/&gt; considering Article 9 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which covers freedom of religion. After a discussion of the [[case law]] regarding Article 9 and 10 the court stated: "Under these circumstances, it is likely that the European Court, in a determination of the restriction of Åke Green’s right to preach his Biblically based opinion that a judgment of conviction would constitute, would find that this restriction is not proportionate, and would therefore be a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights."&lt;ref name="SupCourt"/&gt;

The sentence has raised a controversy all around the world, with disputes between those who see it as a victory for [[human rights]] and freedom from intolerance, and those who see it as an attack on [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]] and the right to [[freedom of speech|free speech]], which in themselves are both regarded as [[human right]]s.

Green became a cause celebre for [[Homophobia|anti-gay]] preacher [[Fred Phelps]], who has labelled anyone who held the belief that [[God]] could love non-elect [[sin]]ners as being eternally [[damnation|damned]]. Nonetheless, Phelps installed a monument praising Green on his website. (All of the other "monuments" to people on Phelps' sites actually express joy at the death of that person.) Phelps also launched a new website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godhatessweden.com God Hates Sweden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050105032032/http://www.godhatessweden.com/ |date=5 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (GodHatesSweden.com) partially in tribute to Green. Green subsequently denounced Phelps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=818&amp;date=20050107&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it is appalling that people say things like that," Green said, "it is extremely unpleasant." In response, Phelps and his organization, the [[Westboro Baptist Church]], denounced Green as a traitor and an ingrate, and he later removed the Green tribute from his website.

Åke Green was also supported by [[Ulf Ekman]] of [[Livets Ord]] and [[Robert Vesterlund]]'s ''[[Info-14]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Responding to the sentence, Sören Andersson, the president of [[Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights]] (RFSL), said that religious freedom could never be used as a reason to persecute people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.se/2590/20051129/ Åke Green cleared over gay sermon&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temperance organisations==
In the beginning of 2008 the organisation [[IOGT-NTO]], a Swedish [[temperance movement|temperance]] movement, decided to withdraw Åke Green's membership, stating that his statements about homosexuality conflict with IOGT-NTO's bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iogt.se/templates/NewsPageSmall____15743.aspx (Swedish) IOGT-NTO's decision to exclude Åke Green]&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Green became an adherent of the Christian temperance movement, the [[Blue ribbon#Other symbols|Blue Ribbon]]. He was involved in another controversy following the announcement that he was to hold a speech at a common manifestation together with the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] on 1 May 2008, in [[Vänersborg]]. The Social Democrats excluded members of the Blue Ribbon, including Green, after several protests,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttela.se/?article=38461 (Swedish) "Åke Green no longer welcome", story published in local paper TTELA]&lt;/ref&gt; some of which were published in Vänersborgs local newspaper, ''TTELA''.
