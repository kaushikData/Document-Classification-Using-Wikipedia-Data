&lt;!-- Terminology --&gt;
'''Abortion''' is the ending of [[pregnancy]] due to removing an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] before it can [[fetal viability|survive outside the uterus]].&lt;ref name="definition" group="note" /&gt; An abortion that occurs spontaneously is also known as a [[miscarriage]]. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an [[#Induced|induced abortion]], or less frequently an "induced miscarriage". The word ''abortion'' is often used to mean only induced abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/abortion|title=Abortion (noun)|publisher=Oxford Living Dictionaries|accessdate=8 June 2018|quote=''[mass noun]'' The deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks of pregnancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar procedure after the fetus could potentially survive outside the [[womb]] is known as a "[[late termination of pregnancy]]" or less accurately as a "late term abortion".&lt;ref name=stuart&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=DA |last2=Stuart |first2=G |title=Abortion jabberwocky: the need for better terminology |journal=Contraception |year=2010 |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=93–6 |pmid=20103443 |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2009.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical abortions are those induced by [[abortifacient]] pharmaceuticals. Medical abortion became an alternative method of abortion with the availability of [[prostaglandin]] [[prostaglandin analogue|analogs]] in the 1970s and the [[antiprogestin|antiprogestogen]] [[mifepristone]] (also known as RU-486) in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=1st_Methods/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kapp2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kulier 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kulier R, Kapp N, Gülmezoglu AM, Hofmeyr GJ, Cheng L, Campana A |title=Medical methods for first trimester abortion|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2011 |issue=11 |page=CD002855 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002855.pub4 |pmid=22071804 |volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Creinin 2009"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Creinin MD, Gemzell-Danielsson K |year=2009|chapter=Medical abortion in early pregnancy|veditors=Paul M, Lichtenberg ES, Borgatta L, Grimes DA, Stubblefield PG, Creinin MD |title=Management of unintended and abnormal pregnancy: comprehensive abortion care|location=Oxford|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=111–134|isbn=1-4051-7696-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kapp 2009"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Kapp N, von Hertzen H |year=2009|chapter=Medical methods to induce abortion in the second trimester|veditors=Paul M, Lichtenberg ES, Borgatta L, Grimes DA, Stubblefield PG, Creinin MD |title=Management of unintended and abnormal pregnancy: comprehensive abortion care|location=Oxford|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=178–192|isbn=1-4051-7696-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common early first-trimester medical abortion regimens use mifepristone in combination with a prostaglandin analog ([[misoprostol]] or [[gemeprost]]) up to 9 weeks gestational age, [[methotrexate]] in combination with a prostaglandin analog up to 7 weeks gestation, or a prostaglandin analog alone.&lt;ref name="Kulier 2011"/&gt; Mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimens work faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexate–misoprostol combination regimens, and combination regimens are more effective than misoprostol alone.&lt;ref name="Creinin 2009"/&gt; This regime is effective in the second trimester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wildschut|first=H|author2=Both, MI|author3= Medema, S|author4= Thomee, E|author5= Wildhagen, MF|author6= Kapp, N|title=Medical methods for mid-trimester termination of pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=19 January 2011|issue=1|pages=CD005216|pmid=21249669|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005216.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical abortion regiments involving mifepristone followed by misoprostol in the cheek between 24 and 48 hours later are effective when performed before 63 days' gestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=MJ|last2=Creinin|first2=MD|title=Mifepristone With Buccal Misoprostol for Medical Abortion: A Systematic Review.|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=July 2015|volume=126|issue=1|pages=12–21|doi=10.1097/AOG.0000000000000897|pmid=26241251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These techniques differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, in how early in pregnancy they can be used, and in whether [[cervical dilation]] is necessary.

MVA, also known as "mini-suction" and "[[menstrual extraction]]", can be used in very early pregnancy, and does not require cervical dilation. [[Dilation and curettage]] (D&amp;C), the second most common method of surgical abortion, is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. [[Curettage]] refers to cleaning the walls of the [[uterus]] with a [[curette]]. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends this procedure, also called ''sharp curettage,'' only when MVA is unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[World Health Organization]] |chapter=Dilatation and curettage |chapterurl=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html |title=Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth: A Guide for Midwives and Doctors |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |location=Geneva |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-92-4-154587-7 |oclc=181845530 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 15th week of gestation until approximately the 26th, other techniques must be used. [[Dilation and evacuation]] (D&amp;E) consists of opening the [[cervix]] of the uterus and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction. After the 16th week of gestation, abortions can also be induced by [[intact dilation and extraction]] (IDX) (also called intrauterine cranial decompression), which requires surgical decompression of the fetus's head before evacuation. IDX is sometimes called "[[partial-birth abortion]]", which has been [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|federally banned]] in the United States.

In the third trimester of pregnancy, induced abortion may be performed surgically by [[intact dilation and extraction]] or by hysterotomy. [[Hysterotomy abortion]] is a procedure similar to a [[caesarean section]] and is performed under [[general anesthesia]]. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=McGee |first=Glenn |authorlink=Glenn McGee |author2=[[Jon F.

First-trimester procedures can generally be performed using [[local anesthesia]], while second-trimester methods may require [[Sedation#Levels of sedation|deep sedation]] or [[general anesthesia]].&lt;ref name="NEJMDec2011"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Templeton |first1=A. |last2=Grimes |first2=D.

===Labor induction abortion===

In places lacking the necessary medical skill for dilation and extraction, or where preferred by practitioners, an abortion can be induced by first [[Labor induction|inducing labor]] and then [[Late termination of pregnancy#Methods|inducing fetal demise]] if necessary.&lt;ref name=GLOWM_Late&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borgatta|first1=L|journal=Global Library of Women's Medicine|date=December 2014|volume=GLOWM.10444|doi=10.3843/GLOWM.10444|url=http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Labor%20Induction%20Termination%20of%20Pregnancy/item/443|accessdate=25 September 2015|title=Labor Induction Termination of Pregnancy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924082507/http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Labor%20Induction%20Termination%20of%20Pregnancy/item/443|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes called "induced miscarriage". This procedure may be performed from 13 weeks gestation to the third trimester. Although it is very uncommon in the United States, more than 80% of induced abortions throughout the second trimester are labor induced abortions in Sweden and other nearby countries.&lt;ref name=Labor_Induced_Abortion&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Society of Family Planning|title=Clinical Guidelines, Labor induction abortion in the second trimester|journal=Contraception|date=February 2011|volume=84|issue=1|pages=4–18|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.02.005|url=http://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(11)00057-6/pdf|quote="10. What is the effect of feticide on labor induction abortion outcome? Deliberately causing demise of the fetus before labor induction abortion is performed primarily to avoid transient fetal survival after expulsion; this approach may be for the comfort of both the woman and the staff, to avoid futile resuscitation efforts. Some providers allege that feticide also facilitates delivery, although little data support this claim. Transient fetal survival is very unlikely after intraamniotic installation of saline or urea, which are directly feticidal. Transient survival with misoprostol for labor induction abortion at greater than 18 weeks ranges from 0% to 50% and has been observed in up to 13% of abortions performed with high-dose oxytocin. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of transient fetal survival with labor induction abortion include increasing gestational age, decreasing abortion interval and the use of nonfeticidal inductive agents such as the PGE1 analogues."|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only limited data are available comparing this method with dilation and extraction.&lt;ref name=Labor_Induced_Abortion/&gt;  Unlike D&amp;E, labor induced abortions after 18 weeks may be complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival, which may be legally characterized as live birth. For this reason, labor induced abortion is legally risky in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Labor_Induced_Abortion/&gt;&lt;ref name=NAF_2015_Policy&gt;{{cite journal|title=2015 Clinical Policy Guidelines|publisher=National Abortion Federation|date=2015|url=http://prochoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2015_NAF_CPGs.pdf|accessdate=30 October 2015|quote=Policy Statement: Medical induction abortion is a safe and effective method for termination of pregnancies beyond the first trimester when performed by trained clinicians in medical offices, freestanding clinics, ambulatory surgery centers, and hospitals.

===Other methods===
Historically, a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in [[folk medicine]]. Among these are: [[tansy]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], [[black cohosh]], and the now-extinct [[silphium]].&lt;ref name="riddle2"&gt;{{Cite book|first=John M. |last=Riddle |title=Eve's herbs: a history of contraception and abortion in the West |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |year=1997|isbn=978-0-674-27024-4 |oclc=36126503}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44–47,62–63,154–155,230–231}}

However, modern users of these plants often lack knowledge of the proper use and dosage.  The historian of medicine [[John M. Riddle|John Riddle]] has spoken of the "broken chain of knowledge,"&lt;ref name="riddle2"/&gt;{{rp|167–205}}
and historian of science [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] has written,&lt;ref name="ahk"&gt;{{cite book | last=Koblitz | first=Ann Hibner | title=Sex and Herbs and Birth Control: Women and Fertility Regulation Through the Ages | publisher=Kovalevskaia Fund | year=2014 | isbn=978-0989665506}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125}}
{{Quote|
U.S. women of European descent have perhaps become particularly ignorant about the wealth of herbal remedies that previous generations accumulated over the centuries.  And sometimes their fumbling attempts to recover the knowledge can be disastrous.
}}
For example, in 1978 one woman in Colorado died and another was seriously injured when they attempted to procure an abortion by taking pennyroyal oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Pennyroyal oil poisoning and hepatoxicity | journal=Journal of the American Medical Association | year=1979|volume=242|issue=26|pages=2873–2874|doi=10.1001/jama.1979.03300260043027| last1=Sullivan | first1=John B. |first2=Barry H. |last2=Rumack |first3=Harold Jr|last3=Thomas|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Because the indiscriminant use of herbs as abortifacients can cause serious—even lethal—side effects, such as [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ failure]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ciganda C, Laborde A |title=Herbal infusions used for induced abortion |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=235–239 |year=2003 |pmid=12807304 |doi=10.1081/CLT-120021104 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such use is not recommended by physicians.

Abortion is sometimes attempted by causing trauma to the abdomen.

Reported methods of unsafe, [[self-induced abortion]] include misuse of [[misoprostol]], and insertion of non-surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus. These and other methods to terminate pregnancy may be called "induced miscarriage".

In 1936 the prominent professor of obstetrics and gynecology [[Frederick J. Taussig]] wrote that a cause of increasing mortality during the years of illegality in the U.S. was that
{{Quote|
With each decade of the past fifty years the actual and proportionate frequency of this accident [perforation of the uterus] has increased, due, first, to the increase in the number of instrumentally induced abortions; second, to the proportionate increase in abortions handled by doctors as against those handled by midwives; and, third, to the prevailing tendency to use instruments instead of the finger in emptying the uterus.

===Unsafe abortion===
{{Main|Unsafe abortion}}

[[File:RussianAbortionPoster.jpg|thumb|Soviet poster circa 1925, warning against midwives performing abortions. Title translation: "Abortions performed by either trained or self-taught midwives not only maim the woman, they also often lead to death."]]

Women seeking to terminate their pregnancies sometimes resort to unsafe methods, particularly when access to legal abortion is restricted. They may attempt to [[self-induced abortion|self-abort]] or rely on another person who does not have proper medical training or access to proper facilities. This has a tendency to lead to severe complications, such as incomplete abortion, [[sepsis]], hemorrhage, and damage to internal organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Okonofua |first1=F. |title=Abortion and maternal mortality in the developing world |journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada |volume=28 |issue=11 |pages=974–979 |year=2006 |pmid=17169222 |url=http://www.jogc.org/abstracts/full/200611_WomensHealth_1.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111121431/http://www.jogc.org/abstracts/full/200611_WomensHealth_1.pdf |archivedate=11 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence==
There are two commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of abortion:
* Abortion rate&amp;nbsp;– number of abortions per 1000 women between 15 and 44 years of age
* Abortion percentage&amp;nbsp;– number of abortions out of 100 known pregnancies (pregnancies include live births, abortions and miscarriages)

In many places, where abortion is illegal or carries a heavy social stigma, medical reporting of abortion is not reliable.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2007"/&gt; For this reason, estimates of the incidence of abortion must be made without determining certainty related to standard error.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2012" /&gt;

The number of abortions performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in recent years, with 41.6&amp;nbsp;million having been performed in 2003 and 43.8&amp;nbsp;million having been performed in 2008.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2012" /&gt; The abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women, though it was 24 per 1000 women for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women for developing countries.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2012" /&gt; The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2012" /&gt;

On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely.&lt;ref name=IJGO10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Shah I, Ahman E |title=Unsafe abortion: global and regional incidence, trends, consequences, and challenges |journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=1149–58 |date=December 2009 |pmid=20085681 |doi= 10.1016/s1701-2163(16)34376-6|quote=However, a woman's chance of having an abortion is similar whether she lives in a developed or a developing region: in 2003 the rates were 26 abortions per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 in developed areas and 29 per 1000 in developing areas.

The rate of legal, induced abortion varies extensively worldwide. According to the report of employees of Guttmacher Institute it ranged from 7 per 1000 women (Germany and Switzerland) to 30 per 1000 women (Estonia) in countries with complete statistics in 2008. The proportion of pregnancies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about 10% (Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland) to 30% (Estonia) in the same group, though it might be as high as 36% in Hungary and Romania, whose statistics were deemed incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sedgh |first1=G. |last2=Singh |first2=S. |last3=Henshaw |first3=S.

The abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years; this is referred to as ''total abortion rate'' (TAR).

===Gestational age and method===

Abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported that 26% of reported legal induced abortions in the United States were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks' gestation, 18% at 7 weeks, 15% at 8 weeks, 18% at 9 through 10 weeks, 9.7% at 11 through 12 weeks, 6.2% at 13 through 15 weeks, 4.1% at 16 through 20 weeks and 1.4% at more than 21 weeks. 90.9% of these were classified as having been done by "[[curettage]]" ([[Suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]], [[dilation and curettage]], [[dilation and evacuation]]), 7.7% by "[[medical abortion|medical]]" means ([[mifepristone]]), 0.4% by "[[instillation abortion|intrauterine instillation]]" (saline or [[prostaglandin]]), and 1.0% by "other" (including [[hysterotomy abortion|hysterotomy]] and [[hysterectomy]]).&lt;ref name="cdc2003"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Strauss |first1=L.

The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.&lt;ref name="guttmacher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bankole98"/&gt;
[[File:AGIAbortionReasonsBarChart.png|thumb|A bar chart depicting selected data from a 1998 [[Alan Guttmacher Institute|AGI]] [[meta-study]] on the reasons women stated for having an abortion.]] Some of the most common reasons are to postpone childbearing to a more suitable time or to focus energies and resources on existing children. Others include being unable to afford a child either in terms of the direct costs of raising a child or the loss of income while caring for the child, lack of support from the father, inability to afford additional children, desire to provide schooling for existing children, disruption of one's own education, relationship problems with their partner, a perception of being too young to have a child, unemployment, and not being willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or [[incest]], among others.&lt;ref name="bankole98"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bankole |first1=Akinrinola |last2=Singh |first2=Susheela |last3=Haas |first3=Taylor |year=1998 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2411798.html |title=Reasons Why Women Have Induced Abortions: Evidence from 27 Countries |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=117–127; 152 |doi=10.2307/3038208 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117191716/http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2411798.html |archivedate=17 January 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="finer2005"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Finer |first1=L.

===Societal===
Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures. These might include the preference for children of a specific sex or race,&lt;ref name="Nuremberg"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Nuremberg and the Crime of Abortion|url=http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1047&amp;context=lusol_fac_pubs|accessdate=12 July 2014|page=283|volume=42|work=U.

An American study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of [[birth control|contraception]] at the time of becoming pregnant. Inconsistent use was reported by half of those using [[condom]]s and three-quarters of those using the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]; 42% of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/3097748 |last1=Jones |first1=R.

===Maternal and fetal health===
An additional factor is risk to maternal or fetal health, which was cited as the primary reason for abortion in over a third of cases in some countries and as a significant factor in only a single-digit percentage of abortions in other countries.&lt;ref name="guttmacher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bankole98"/&gt;

In the U.S., the Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'': "ruled that the state's interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only at the point of viability, defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently of its mother. Even after the point of viability, the state cannot favor the life of the fetus over the life or health of the pregnant woman. Under the right of privacy, physicians must be free to use their "medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother." On the same day that the Court decided Roe, it also decided Doe v. Bolton, in which the Court defined health very broadly: "The medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors—physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age—relevant to the well-being of the patient. All these factors may relate to health. This allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment."&lt;ref&gt;George J. Annas and Sherman Elias.

Public opinion shifted in America following television personality [[Sherri Finkbine]]'s discovery during her fifth month of pregnancy that she had been exposed to [[thalidomide]]. Unable to obtain a legal abortion in the United States, she traveled to Sweden. From 1962 to 1965, an outbreak of [[Rubella|German measles]] left 15,000 babies with severe birth defects. In 1967, the [[American Medical Association]] publicly supported liberalization of abortion laws. A National Opinion Research Center poll in 1965 showed 73% supported abortion when the mother's life was at risk, 57% when birth defects were present and 59% for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.{{sfn|Doan|2007|p=57}}

====Cancer====
&lt;!-- Sources here are &gt;10 years old, and should be updated with new ones --&gt;
The rate of cancer during pregnancy is 0.02–1%, and in many cases, cancer of the mother leads to consideration of abortion to protect the life of the mother, or in response to the potential damage that may occur to the fetus during treatment. This is particularly true for [[cervical cancer]], the most common type of which occurs in 1 of every 2,000–13,000 pregnancies, for which initiation of treatment "cannot co-exist with preservation of fetal life (unless [[neoadjuvant chemotherapy]] is chosen)". Very early stage cervical cancers (I and IIa) may be treated by [[radical hysterectomy]] and pelvic [[lymph node]] dissection, [[radiation therapy]], or both, while later stages are treated by radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used simultaneously. Treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations, because [[lumpectomy]] is discouraged in favor of modified [[radical mastectomy]] unless late-term pregnancy allows follow-up radiation therapy to be administered after the birth.&lt;ref name=Weisz&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/384.full.pdf |format=PDF |title=Cancer in pregnancy: maternal and fetal implications |pmid=11476351 |last1=Weisz |first1=B |last2=Schiff |first2=E |last3=Lishner |first3=M |year=2001 |volume=7 |pages=384–393 |issue=4 |journal=Human Reproduction Update |doi=10.1093/humupd/7.4.384 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015195038/http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/384.full.pdf |archivedate=15 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to a single chemotherapy drug is estimated to cause a 7.5–17% risk of [[teratogenic]] effects on the fetus, with higher risks for multiple drug treatments. Treatment with more than 40 [[gray (unit)|Gy]] of radiation usually causes spontaneous abortion. Exposure to much lower doses during the first trimester, especially 8 to 15 weeks of development, can cause [[intellectual disability]] or [[microcephaly]], and exposure at this or subsequent stages can cause reduced intrauterine growth and birth weight. Exposures above 0.005–0.025 Gy cause a dose-dependent reduction in [[IQ]].&lt;ref name=Weisz /&gt; It is possible to greatly reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding, depending on how far the area to be irradiated is from the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mayr |first1=NA |last2=Wen |first2=BC |last3=Saw |first3=CB|title=Radiation therapy during pregnancy |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Clinics of North America |year=1998 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=301–21 |pmid=9629572 |doi=10.1016/s0889-8545(05)70006-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11237773"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fenig E, Mishaeli M, Kalish Y, Lishner M | title=Pregnancy and radiation. |journal=Cancer Treatment Reviews |year=2001 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |pmid=11237773 |doi=10.1053/ctrv.2000.0193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of birth itself may also put the mother at risk. "Vaginal delivery may result in dissemination of neoplastic cells into lymphovascular channels, haemorrhage, cervical laceration and implantation of malignant cells in the episiotomy site, while abdominal delivery may delay the initiation of non-surgical treatment."&lt;ref name="pmid19197101"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Li WW, Yau TN, Leung CW, Pong WM, Chan MY |title=Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix complicating pregnancy |journal=Hong Kong Medical Journal |year=2009 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=69–72 |pmid=19197101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[history of abortion|ancient times]] abortions have been done using [[abortifacient|herbal medicines]], sharp tools, with [[physical trauma|force]], or through other [[traditional medicine|traditional methods]].&lt;ref name="Management of Abortion, Chp 1"/&gt; Induced abortion has long history, and can be traced back to civilizations as varied as China under [[Shennong]] (c. 2700 BCE), [[Ancient Egypt]] with its [[Ebers Papyrus]] (c. 1550 BCE), and the Roman Empire in the time of [[Juvenal]] (c. 200 CE).&lt;ref name="Management of Abortion, Chp 1"/&gt; There is evidence to suggest that pregnancies were terminated through a number of methods, including the administration of abortifacient herbs, the use of sharpened implements, the application of abdominal pressure, and other techniques. One of the [[History of abortion#5th century to 18th century|earliest]] known artistic representations of abortion is in a [[bas relief]] at Angkor Wat (c. 1150).

===Abortion debate===
{{Main|Abortion debate}}
Induced abortion has long been the source of considerable debate. [[Medical ethics|Ethical]], [[Morality|moral]], [[Philosophical aspects of the abortion debate|philosophical]], [[Therapeutic abortion|biological]], [[Ethics in religion|religious]] and [[Abortion law|legal]] issues surrounding abortion are related to [[value system]]s. Opinions of abortion may be about [[fetal rights]], governmental authority, and [[women's rights]].

In both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Courtney| last=Farrell| title =Abortion Debate| publisher =ABDO Publishing Company| year =2010| pages =6–7| isbn =1617852643}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Medical Association]] Declaration on Therapeutic Abortion notes, "circumstances bringing the interests of a mother into conflict with the interests of her unborn child create a dilemma and raise the question as to whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/a1/ |title=WMA Declaration on Therapeutic Abortion |publisher=[[World Medical Association|WMA]] |accessdate=28 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028182953/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/a1/ |archivedate=28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion debates, especially pertaining to [[abortion law]]s, are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions. Anti-abortion groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion, including complete prohibition, most often describe themselves as "pro-life" while abortion rights groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as "pro-choice".&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the former position argues that a human fetus is a [[Personhood|human person]] with a [[right to life|right to live]], making abortion morally the same as [[murder]]. The latter position argues that a woman has certain [[reproductive rights]], especially the right to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term.

{{AbortionLawsMap|size=350px}}

Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural factors continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The [[right to life]], the right to liberty, the right to [[security of person]], and the right to [[reproductive health]] are major issues of human rights that sometimes constitute the basis for the existence or absence of abortion laws.

In jurisdictions where abortion is legal, certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a safe, legal abortion (an abortion performed without the woman's consent is considered [[feticide]]). These requirements usually depend on the age of the fetus, often using a [[Pregnancy#Terminology|trimester]]-based system to regulate the window of legality, or as in the U.S., on a doctor's evaluation of the fetus' [[Fetal viability|viability]]. Some jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on [[prenatal development|fetal development]], or require that [[minors and abortion|parents be contacted]] if their minor daughter requests an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalfamilyplanningperspectives.org/pubs/MandatoryCounseling.pdf |title=The Impact of State Mandatory Counseling and Waiting Period Laws on Abortion: A Literature Review |format=PDF |publisher=[[Guttmacher Institute]] |author1=Theodore J.

Other jurisdictions ban abortion almost entirely. Many, but not all, of these allow legal abortions in a variety of circumstances. These circumstances vary based on jurisdiction, but may include whether the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest, the fetus' development is impaired, the woman's physical or mental well-being is endangered, or socioeconomic considerations make childbirth a hardship.&lt;ref name="Dev98-07" /&gt; In countries where abortion is banned entirely, such as [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], medical authorities have recorded rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy as well as deaths due to doctors' fears of prosecution if they treat other gynecological emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European delegation visits Nicaragua to examine effects of abortion ban |date=26 November 2007 |publisher=[[Ipas (organization)|Ipas]] |accessdate=15 June 2009 |url=http://www.ipas.org/Library/News/News_Items/European_delegation_visits_Nicaragua_to_examine_effects_of_abortion_ban.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417033829/http://www.ipas.org/Library/News/News_Items/European_delegation_visits_Nicaragua_to_examine_effects_of_abortion_ban.aspx |archivedate=17 April 2008 |quote=More than 82 maternal deaths had been registered in Nicaragua since the change.

The NGO created a mobile medical clinic inside a shipping container, which then travels on rented ships to countries with restrictive abortion laws.

===Sex-selective abortion===
{{Main|Sex-selective abortion}}

[[Medical ultrasonography|Sonography]] and [[amniocentesis]] allow parents to determine sex before childbirth. The development of this technology has led to [[sex-selective abortion and female infanticide|sex-selective abortion]], or the termination of a fetus based on sex. The selective termination of a female fetus is most common.

Sex-selective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in Taiwan, South Korea, India, and China.&lt;ref&gt;Banister, Judith.

[[Legal protection of access to abortion]] has been brought into some countries where abortion is legal. These laws typically seek to protect abortion clinics from obstruction, vandalism, picketing, and other actions, or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment.

Far more common than physical violence is psychological pressure. In 2003, [[Chris Danze]] organized pro-life organizations throughout Texas to prevent the construction of a [[Planned Parenthood]] facility in Austin. The organizations [[doxing|released the personal information]] online, of those involved with construction, sending them up to 1200 phone calls a day and contacting their churches.&lt;ref name=Doan&gt;{{cite book|title=Opposition and Intimidation:The abortion wars and strategies of political harassment|author=Alesha E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6408">In [[computer science]], specifically in [[algorithm]]s related to [[pathfinding]], a [[heuristic function]] is said to be '''admissible''' if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, i.e. the cost it estimates to reach the goal is not higher than the lowest possible cost from the current point in the path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Search algorithms ==
An admissible heuristic is used to estimate the cost of reaching the 
goal state in an [[informed search algorithm]]. In order for a heuristic
to be admissible to the search problem, the estimated cost must always 
be lower than or equal to the actual cost of reaching the goal state. 
The search algorithm uses the admissible heuristic to find an estimated 
optimal path to the goal state from the current node. 
For example, in [[A* search]] the evaluation function (where 
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the current node) is:

&lt;math&gt;f(n) = g(n) + h(n)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; = the evaluation function.
:&lt;math&gt;g(n)&lt;/math&gt; = the cost from the start node to the current node
:&lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; = estimated cost from current node to goal.

&lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; is calculated using the heuristic 
function. With a non-admissible heuristic, the A* algorithm could 
overlook the optimal solution to a search problem due to an 
overestimation in &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formulation==

: &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a node
: &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is a heuristic
: &lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; is cost indicated by &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; to reach a goal from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;h^*(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal cost to reach a goal from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; is admissible if, &lt;math&gt;\forall n&lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;h(n) \leq h^*(n)&lt;/math&gt;

==Construction==
An admissible heuristic can be derived from a [[Relaxation (approximation)|relaxed]]
version of the problem, or by information from pattern databases that store exact solutions to subproblems of the problem, or by using [[Inductive transfer|inductive learning]] methods.

==Examples==
Two different examples of admissible heuristics apply to the [[fifteen puzzle]] problem:
* [[Hamming distance]]
* [[Manhattan distance]]

The [[Hamming distance]] is the total number of misplaced tiles. It is clear that this heuristic is admissible since the total number of moves to order the tiles correctly is at least the number of misplaced tiles (each tile not in place must be moved at least once). The cost (number of moves) to the goal (an ordered puzzle) is at least the [[Hamming distance]] of the puzzle.

The Manhattan distance of a puzzle is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;h(n)=\sum_\text{all tiles} \mathit{distance}(\text{tile, correct position})&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the puzzle below in which the player wishes to move each tile such that the numbers are ordered. The Manhattan distance is an admissible heuristic in this case because every tile will have to be moved at least the number of spots in between itself and its correct position.&lt;ref name="Korf,2000"&gt;{{Citation | first=Richard E. | last=Korf | contribution-url=https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2000/AAAI00-212.pdf | doi=10.1007/3-540-44914-0_3 | contribution=Recent progress in the design and analysis of admissible heuristic functions | series=SARA 2000.

The subscripts show the Manhattan distance for each tile. The total Manhattan distance for the shown puzzle is:
:&lt;math&gt;h(n)=3+1+0+1+2+3+3+4+3+2+4+4+4+1+1=36&lt;/math&gt;

==Optimality Guarantee==
If an admissible heuristic is adapted in an algorithm (for example in [[A* search algorithm]]), then this algorithm would eventually find an optimal solution to the goal. A well-known and easy-to-understand example is [[breadth-first search]]. In the case of BFS, the heuristic evaluation function &lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; equals to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for each node &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, which is obviously less than the actual cost (thus '''underestimated'''). This heuristic would cause the BFS algorithm to search literally all the possible paths and eventually find the optimal solution (i.e., the shortest path to the goal).

As an example&lt;ref&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23970588/why-do-admissable-heuristics-guarantee-optimality&lt;/ref&gt; of why admissibility can guarantee optimality, let's say we have costs as follows:(the cost above/below a node is the heuristic, the cost at an edge is the actual cost)

  0     10   0   100   0
 START ----  O  ----- GOAL
  |                   |
 0|                   |100
  |                   | 
  O ------- O  ------ O
 100   1    100   1   100

So clearly we'd start off visiting the top middle node, since the expected total cost, i.e. &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;10 + 0 = 10&lt;/math&gt;. Then the goal would be a candidate, with &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;10+100+0=110&lt;/math&gt;. Then we'd clearly pick the bottom nodes one after the other, followed by the updated goal, since they all have &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; lower than the &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; of the current goal, i.e. their &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;100, 101, 102, 102&lt;/math&gt;. So even though the goal was a candidate, we couldn't pick it because there were still better paths out there. This way, an admissible heuristic can ensure optimality.

However, note that although an admissible heuristic can guarantee final optimality, it's not necessarily efficient.

==Notes==
While all [[consistent heuristic]]s are admissible, not all admissible heuristics are consistent.

For tree search problems, if an admissible heuristic is used, the [[A* search algorithm]] will never return a suboptimal goal node.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2783">'''Alexander Gordon, Master of Sutherland''' (c.1505-1530), Scottish magnate, made [[Earl of Sutherland]] in 1527.

==Career==
Alexander Gordon was the son of Adam Gordon of Aboyne (d.1538) and Elizabeth de Moravia, Countess of Sutherland (d.1535), the daughter of [[John de Moravia, 8th Earl of Sutherland]].

In 1522 John Mackay of Strathnaver made a bond to serve Alexander, then Master of Sutherland, as he had served his father. Robert Gordon, the 17th-century historian of the Sutherlands, saw this part as Adam's initiative to put the earldom into his son's hands. According to Robert Gordon, Alexander had defeated armed incursions by the [[Clan Mackay|Mackays]] into Sutherland territory. Adam and Elizabeth had fought the Mackays at the [[Battle of Torran Dubh]] in 1517.

Perhaps in connection with Alexander's marriage to Janet Stewart, daughter of [[John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl]], his parents resigned the Earldom of Sutherland to Alexander in November 1527, and a crown charter to this effect was issued in December. Alexander, now Earl of Sutherland lived at [[Dunrobin Castle]], and died there on 13 January 1530.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Fraser (historian)|Fraser, William]], ed., [https://archive.org/details/sutherlandbook01fras ''Sutherland Book'', vol.1 (1892)], pp.90-98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Master's charter==
Alexander's royal charter of the earldom, dated 1 December 1527 describes his parents as the Earl of Countess of Sutherland. They resigned to him the earldom of Sutherland and its lands, Dunrobin with all its tenants and outliers, mills, sea and freshwater fishing, patronage of the church and chapel there, with some reservations to Adam and Elizabeth in their lifetimes. As Alexander pre-deceased his parents, he did not profit from the earldom in full.&lt;ref&gt;''Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, 1513-1546'', (1883), p.116 no.520&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
With Janet Stewart, Alexander had children;
*[[John Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland]]
*Alexander Gordon (of Kintessock), (d.1552)
*William Gordon
*Janet Gordon, married Patrick Dunbar of Westfield and Cumnock.
*Beatrice Gordon, married William Sinclair of Dunbeath

'''''Angels &amp; Demons''''' is a 2009 American [[Mystery film|mystery]] [[horror film|horror]] [[Thriller film|thriller]] film directed by [[Ron Howard]] and written by [[Akiva Goldsman]] and [[David Koepp]], based on [[Dan Brown]]'s [[Angels &amp; Demons|novel of the same title]]. It is the [[sequel]] to the 2006 film ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'', also directed by Howard, and the second installment in the [[Robert Langdon (film series)|''Robert Langdon'' film series]]. The novel was published first and ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' novel followed it. Filming took place in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], and the [[Sony Pictures Studios]] in [[Culver City, California]]. [[Tom Hanks]] reprises his role as Professor [[Robert Langdon]]. Producer [[Brian Grazer]], composer [[Hans Zimmer]] and screenwriter [[Akiva Goldsman]] also return, with [[David Koepp]] coming on board to help the latter.

The film grossed $485 million worldwide.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; A sequel, titled ''[[Inferno (2016 film)|Inferno]]'', was released on October 28, 2016.

==Plot==
At [[CERN]], Father Silvano and Dr. Vittoria Verna create three canisters of [[antimatter]]. Silvano is murdered, and one of the canisters is stolen. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] mourn the sudden death of [[Pope]] Pius XVI, and prepare for the [[papal conclave]] to elect his successor in [[Vatican City]]. Father Patrick McKenna, the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], takes control of the Vatican. Four of the “preferiti”, the favoured candidates to be Pope, are kidnapped by a man claiming to represent the [[Illuminati]]. He sends the Vatican a warning, claiming he will murder each of the cardinals from 8pm to midnight, where the stolen antimatter will explode and destroy the city, hidden somewhere within.

American [[symbologist]] Professor [[Robert Langdon]] is brought to the Vatican to help. He deduces that the four cardinals will be murdered on the four altars of the “Path of Illumination”, in locations relevant to the [[classical elements]]. McKenna gives Langdon access to the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] to research the altars, against the wishes of Commander Richter, head of the [[Swiss Guard]]. He and Vittoria examine [[Galileo Galilei]]’s [[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|banned book]], following clues to the [[Chigi Chapel]], accompanied by Ernesto Olivetti and Claudio Vincenzi of the [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City]]. They find Cardinal Eber dead, branded with the ambigrammatic word “Earth”.

The second, Cardinal Lamassé, is murdered in [[St. Peter’s Square]], his lungs punctured and branded with “Air”. Vittoria suspects the Pope was actually murdered via overdose, she and McKenna confirming this by secretly inspecting his body. Langdon, Olivetti, and Vincenzi eventually identify the [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome|Santa Maria della Vittoria]] as the altar of fire, finding Cardinal Guidera burning to death, branded with “Fire”. The assassin appears, killing Olivetti and Vincenzi, before escaping to drown Cardinal Baggia in the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]]. Langdon and civilians intervene, rescuing Baggia, who tells Langdon the preferiti were held in [[Castel Sant’Angelo]].

Richter confiscates Dr. Silvano’s journals, Vittoria convinced that he is a conspirator. Langdon, Vittoria, and the police storm Castel Sant’Angelo. Langdon and Vittoria find the assassin’s lair, discovering five brands, the last meant for McKenna. The assassin escapes, claiming his contractors are “men of God”. Guided to a car by his unseen contractor, the assassin dies [[Car bomb|when the vehicle explodes]] upon ignition. Langdon and Vittoria find a secret passageway leading to the Vatican, warning the Swiss Guard of McKenna’s fate. They find Richter hovering over a branded McKenna. He, and Archbishop Simeon, an alleged conspirator, are killed. Langdon retrieves a key from the dying Richter’s hand.

The antimatter container is found in [[Saint Peter's tomb]], but will detonate in five minutes, the cold temperature preventing its battery from being charged in time. McKenna flees the Vatican with the canister, piloting a [[helicopter]] into the sky, then parachutes out seconds before the antimatter detonates. McKenna is hailed as a hero, with calls for him to be elected as Pope. 

Langdon and Vittoria retrieve Silvano’s journals from Richter’s office, finding he kept tabs on the Pope with hidden security cameras. They find footage of Richter confronting McKenna, revealing the Camerlengo is the mastermind behind the attacks. The Pope had invited Silvano to publicly present the antimatter as proof of a divine power, bridging the gap between religion and science. Considering such a claim blasphemy, McKenna orchestrated the Pope’s death, and the Illuminati assassin, then plotted to be elected as Pope. The footage is shown to the papal conclave. McKenna, realising he has been exposed, commits suicide via [[self-immolation]].

The Vatican announces McKenna died from injuries from his parachute landing, and Baggia is elected as Pope Luke I. Cardinal Strauss, the Pope’s new Camerlengo, gives Langdon the “Diagramma Veritatis” as thanks for his help, and to complete his scholarly work on Galileo. The new Pope gives Langdon and Vittoria a thankful nod, before stepping out on the balcony to greet the crowd below.

==Production==

===Development===
In 2003, Sony Pictures acquired the film rights to ''[[Angels &amp; Demons]]'' along with ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' in a deal with author [[Dan Brown]]. In May 2006, following the release of [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|the 2006 film adaptation of ''The Da Vinci Code'']], Sony Pictures hired screenwriter [[Akiva Goldsman]], who wrote the film adaptation of ''The Da Vinci Code'', to adapt ''Angels &amp; Demons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming |url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=features2006&amp;content=jump&amp;jump=story&amp;dept=cannes&amp;nav=NCannes&amp;articleid=VR1117943968&amp;cs=1 |title=Brown's "Angels" flies to bigscreen |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=May 23, 2006 |accessdate=December 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming was originally to begin in February 2008 and was originally going to be released on December 19, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming | title=Howard moves fast with "Code" sequel |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=October 24, 2007 |url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&amp;articleid=VR1117974685&amp;categoryid=1236 |accessdate=October 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but because of the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], the film was pushed back for May 15, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tatiana Siegel |title="Da Vinci" prequel hit by strike |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 16, 2007 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117976189.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=November 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Koepp]] rewrote the script before shooting began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tatiana Siegel |title=Koepp hopes to keep "Town" rolling |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 11, 2008 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117988832.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[Ron Howard]] chose to treat ''Angels &amp; Demons'' as a sequel to the previous film, rather than a [[prequel]], since many had read the novel after ''The Da Vinci Code''. He liked the idea that Langdon had been through one adventure and become a more confident character.&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Ian Freer]] |title=Critical Mass |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date = May 2009|pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard was also more comfortable taking liberties in adapting the story because the novel is less popular than ''The Da Vinci Code''.&lt;ref name="arrested"&gt;{{cite news|author=Edward Douglas |title=Ron Howard on Arrested Development and Angels &amp; Demons |work=ComingSoon.net |date=November 13, 2008 |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=50497 |accessdate=November 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Brian Grazer]] said they were too "reverential" when adapting ''The Da Vinci Code'', which resulted in it being "a little long and stagey." This time, "Langdon doesn't stop and give a speech. When he speaks, he's in motion."&lt;ref name="faster"&gt;{{cite news|author=Scott Bowles |title=First look: "Angels &amp; Demons" will fly faster than "Da Vinci" |work=[[USA Today]] |date=October 17, 2008 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-10-27-angels-demons_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip |accessdate=October 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard concurred "it's very much about modernity clashing with antiquity and technology vs. faith, so these themes, these ideas are much more active whereas the other one lived so much in the past. The tones are just innately so different between the two stories."&lt;ref name=arrested/&gt;

===Differences between novel and film===
* In the novel, the papal conclave attracts relatively little public attention. In the wake of the huge international interest in the [[Papal conclave, 2005|2005 election]] of [[Pope Benedict XVI]], this was judged to be out of date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Hanks| first = Tom| author2 = interviewed by Charlie Rose| title = A conversation about the film "Angels and Demons"| publisher = PBS television (transcript)| date = May 13, 2009| url = http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10294#frame_top| accessdate = June 12, 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090517111531/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10294#frame_top| archivedate = May 17, 2009| deadurl = yes| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of CERN Director Maximillian Kohler does not appear in the film. The Italian Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is changed to the Irish Patrick McKenna, portrayed by [[Ewan McGregor]]. The [[Boeing X-33]] that takes Langdon from the United States to Geneva and then to Rome is absent in the film. In the novel, Commander Olivetti is the commander of [[Swiss Guard]], and his second in command is Captain Rocher, whereas in the film, Richter is the head of the Swiss Guard. In the novel, the Assassin contacts members of the BBC in order to influence how they present the story of his activities, but this does not happen in the film. The character Leonardo Vetra is named Silvano Bentivoglio in the film, is not related to Vittoria and his death scene is changed. Vittoria is a love interest for Langdon in the novel while there is no attraction present in the film. In the novel Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is revealed to be the late pope's biological son, while in the film he is his adoptive son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's the Difference between Angels and Demons the Book and Angels and Demons the Movie|url=http://thatwasnotinthebook.com/diff/angels_and_demons_book_2000_vs_angels_and_demons_movie_2009|publisher=thatwasnotinthebook.com|accessdate=18 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the film, the Camerlengo briefly acknowledges Langdon's involvement in some events of the [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|previous film]] when in the book it does not, as the events in ''The Da Vinci Code'' are yet to take place. This is due to the fact the first novel in the film series was adapted to film after the second book rather than in the order of first-to-last. 
* In the book, the assassin has Middle Eastern looks whereas in the movie he is portrayed by a Danish actor. In the film, he is killed by a car bomb, whereas in the book he falls from a balcony at the top of the [[Castel Sant Angelo]] and breaks his back on a pile of marble cannonballs which eventually kills him.
* In the novel, Vittoria is kidnapped, whereas in the film, she accompanies Langdon almost everywhere. In the book, all four preferiti are killed by the assassin and eventually the high elector, Cardinal Saverio Mortati, is elected as the new pope, whereas in the film, the fourth preferito, Cardinal Baggia, is saved by Langdon and is elected the new pope. The high elector, renamed Cardinal Strauss, becomes the Camerlengo to the new pope.
* In the book, the fifth brand is one that incorporates all four words from the previous four, whereas in the film, the fifth brand is the crossed keys, symbolic of the Papacy.
* The means by which the heroes discover the location of the bomb is significantly different. In the book, the Camerlengo feigns a religious vision from god, telling him where to find the bomb. In the film, he feeds Langdon a clue to the bomb's location by branding himself with an upside-down version of the papal keys, which Langdon successfully deduces is a metaphor for [[Saint Peter]], the first pope, who was crucified upside-down.
* In the book, Langdon stows away on the Camerlengo's helicopter, and just before the antimatter explosion, jumps out using a makeshift parachute, and lands on [[Isola Tiberina]], whose mythical healing powers heal the injuries he incurs from the fall. In the film, Langdon does not get on the helicopter.
* In the book's closing scenes, a Swiss Guard hands Langdon the fifth brand, the Illuminati diamond, as a gift. In the film, the new Camerlengo hands over Galileo's book to Langdon.

Howard hated that the Writers Guild strike forced him to delay shooting the film until summer. However, the quick shoot allowed him to refine the [[naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] he had employed on his previous film ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]'', often using handheld cameras to lend an additional energy to the scenes.

Hanks interrupted filming of one scene in order to help Australian bride Natalia Dearnley get through the crowds to her wedding on time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=815244 Hanks saves Aussie bride], [[Nine News]]. Published May 19, 2009. Retrieved September 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; McGregor said the Pope's funeral was the dullest sequence to film, as they were just walking across staircases. Then, "Someone started singing '[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]' [and] it became the funeral theme tune."&lt;ref name="empire"/&gt;

When recreating the interior of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], production designer Allan Cameron and visual effects supervisor Angus Bickerton recognized the {{cvt|80|ft|m}} tall soundstages were only half the size of the real church. They rebuilt the area around and the crypts beneath [[St. Peter's baldachin]], including the bottoms of the columns and [[Saint Peter]]'s statue, and surrounded it with a 360 degree greenscreen so the rest could be built digitally. Cameron had twenty crew members, posing as members of the public, photograph as much as they could inside the [[Sistine Chapel]], and had artists sketch, photograph and enlarge recreations of the paintings and mosaics from the photographs. Cameron chose to present the Sistine Chapel as it was before [[Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes|the restoration of its frescoes]], because he preferred the contrast the smoky, muted colors would present with the cardinals. Although the chapel was built to full size, the [[Sala Regia (Vatican)|Sala Regia]] was made smaller to fit inside the stage.&lt;ref name="location"&gt;{{cite web|title=On Location |work=Official website |url=http://www.angelsanddemons.com/site/entry.php#location |accessdate=March 25, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216204925/http://angelsanddemons.com/site/entry.php |archivedate=February 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Saint Peter's Square]] and the [[Piazza Navona]] sets were built on the same [[backlot]]; after completion of scenes at the former, six weeks were spent converting the set, knocking down the Basilica side and excavating {{cvt|3+1/2|ft|m|0}} of tarmac to build the fountain. As there had been filming at the real Piazza Navona, the transition between it and the replica had to be seamless. To present the [[Santa Maria del Popolo]] undergoing renovation, a police station in Rome opposite the real church was used for the exterior; the scaffolding would hide that it was not the church. Cameron built the interior of Santa Maria del Popolo on the same set as the recreated [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome|Santa Maria della Vittoria]] to save money; the scaffolding also disguised this. The film's version of Santa Maria della Vittoria was larger than the real one, so it would accommodate the cranes used to film the scene. To film the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon's]] interior, two [[aedicula]]e and the tomb of [[Raphael]] were rebuilt to scale at a height of {{cvt|30|ft|m|0}}, while the rest was greenscreen. Because of the building's symmetrical layout, the filmmakers were able to shoot the whole scene over two days and [[redress]] the real side to pretend it was another.&lt;ref name=location/&gt; The [[second unit]] took photographs of the [[Large Hadron Collider]] and pasted these in scenes set at [[CERN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perkins|first1=Ceri|title=ATLAS gets the Hollywood treatment|url=http://atlas-service-enews.web.cern.ch/atlas-service-enews/2007-8/news_07-8/news_angelphoto.php|website=ATLAS e-News|publisher=CERN|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
Overseas, ''Angels &amp; Demons'' maintained the #1 position for the second weekend as well even with the release of ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]'', which opened at #2. The film opened with $46 million at the domestic box office. ''The Da Vinci Code'' had opened domestically to $77.1 million, but the sequel's opening met Columbia's $40–50 million prediction, since the film's source material was not as popular as its predecessor's. Within more than a month, the film grossed $478,869,160 worldwide, making it the largest-grossing film of 2009 until it was surpassed by ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Angels &amp; Demons" flies high at box office (Reuters) |work=[[Yahoo!

===Critical response===
Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 37% of 249 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The site's general consensus is that "''Angels and Demons'' is a fast-paced thrill ride, and an improvement on the last Dan Brown adaptation, but the storyline too often wavers between implausible and ridiculous, and does not translate effectively to the big screen."&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1189217-angels_and_demons/ |title=Angels &amp; Demons (2009) |accessdate=May 3, 2012 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | work=[[IGN Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] has a rating score of 48 out of 100 based on 36 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/angelsanddemons |title=Angels &amp; Demons (2009): Reviews |accessdate=May 2, 2010 |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |work=[[CNET Networks]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC]] critic [[Mark Kermode]] criticized the film's "silliness", saying "Whereas the original movie featured Hanks standing around in darkened rooms explaining the plot to anyone who was still awake, this second salvo cranks up the action by having Tom explain the plot while running—a major breakthrough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kermode|first1=Mark|title=Angels &amp; Demons|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/13/mark-kermode-crank2-high-voltage|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic Church response===
''[[CBS News]]'' interviewed a priest working in [[Santa Susanna]], who stated the Church did not want their churches to be associated with scenes of murder. A tour guide also stated most priests do not object to tourists who visit out of interest after reading the book, a trend which will continue after people see the film. "I think they are aware that it's... a work of fiction and that it's bringing people into their churches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fans Line Up For "Angels &amp; Demons" Tours |work=[[CBS News]] |date=June 19, 2008 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/19/earlyshow/leisure/boxoffice/main4193975.shtml |accessdate=June 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grazer deemed it odd that although ''The Da Vinci Code'' was a more controversial novel, they had more freedom shooting its film adaptation in London and France.&lt;ref name="faster"/&gt; Italian authorities hoped the filmmakers corrected the location errors in the novel, to limit the amount of explaining they will have to do for confused tourists.&lt;ref name=stop/&gt;

[[William A.

"My goal... is to give the public a big FYI: Enjoy the movie, but know that it is a fable. It is based on malicious myths, intentionally advanced by Ron Howard."

In [[Samoa]], the film was banned by film censor Lei'ataua Olo'apu.

'''Anthropodermic bibliopegy''' is the practice of [[Bookbinding|binding books]] in [[human skin]]. As of April 2016, The Anthropodermic Book Project "has identified 47 alleged anthropodermic books in the world's libraries and museums. Of those, 30 books have been tested or are in the process of being tested. Seventeen of the books have been confirmed as having human skin bindings and nine were proven to be not of human origin but of sheep, pig, cow, or other animals."&lt;ref&gt;Megan Rosenbloom, ''[http://iis-exhibits.library.ucla.edu/alhhs/Watermark_Vol_39_No_3_Summer_2016.pdf#page=20 A Book by its Cover: Identifying &amp; Scientifically Testing the World's Books Bound in Human Skin]'', ''Watermark: Newsletter of the Archivists and Librarians in the History of the Health Sciences'', volume XXXIX, number 3 (Summer 2016), page 22&lt;/ref&gt; (The confirmed figures as of  August 2017 have increased to 18 bindings identified as human and 14 disproved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://anthropodermicbooks.org/ The Anthropodermic Books Project], home page, checked 7 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Terminology ==

These are almost exclusively terms which are not part of normal discourse and would be unknown to most people. Many are technical terms from specialized discourses.' [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/18644 OED entry for ''bibliopegy''], checked 1 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; synonym for [[bookbinding]]. It combines the [[Ancient Greek]] [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B2%CE%B9%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%BD βιβλίον] (''biblion'' = book) and πηγία (''pegia'', from ''pegnynai'' = to fasten).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/18644 OED entry for ''bibliopegy''], checked 9 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] dates from 1876; [[Merriam-Webster]] gives the date of first use as ''circa'' 1859&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bibliopegy Merriam-Webster definition for ''bibliopegy''], checked 9 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and the OED records an instance of ''bibliopegist'' for a bookbinder from 1824.

The word ''anthropodermic'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|θ|r|oʊ|p|ə|ˈ|d|ɜːr|m|ɪ|k}} {{respell|AN|throh|pə|DUR|mik}}), combining the Ancient Greek [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%84%CE%BD%CE%B8%CF%81%CF%89%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%82 ἄνθρωπος] (''anthropos'' = man or human) and [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B4%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%BC%CE%B1 δέρμα] (''derma'' = skin), does not appear in the Oxford English Dictionary and appears never to be used in contexts other than bookbinding. The phrase 'anthropodermic bibliopegy' has been used at least since [[Lawrence S. Thompson]]'s article on the subject, published in 1946. The practice of binding a book in the skin of its author - as with ''The Highwayman'', discussed below - has been called 'autoanthropodermic bibliopegy'&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, ''Religatum de Pelle Humana'', pages 140-142&lt;/ref&gt; (from [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/αὐτός αὐτός] ''autos'', self).

== History ==
[[File:S. Pinaeus, De integritatis et corruptionis virginum... Wellcome L0030772.jpg|thumb|A book in the [[Wellcome Library]] bound in human skin.]]

One of the earliest examples of a binding claimed to be in human skin is the account published in 1606 of the execution of [[Henry Garnet]] for his involvement in the [[Gunpowder Plot]], ''A True and Perfect Relation of the Whole Proceedings Against ... Garnet a Jesuit''. A copy auctioned in 2007 was claimed by the auctioneer to be bound in Garnet's own skin.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Dibbell, [http://philobiblos.blogspot.co.uk/2007/11/garnet-book-images.html ''Garnet Book Images''] PhiloBiblos, 28 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early reference to a book bound in human skin is found in the travels of [[Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach]]. Writing about his visit to [[Bremen]] in 1710: {{Quote|text=Auch sahen wir noch ein klein Büchelgen in Duodetz, ''[[Martin Moller|Molleri]] manuale præparationis ad mortem''. Man würde daran wohl nichts merkwürdiges finden, und warum es allhier stehe, erkennen, wenn man nicht vornen läse, daß es in Menschen-Leder eingebunden sey; welcher sonderbare Band, desgleichen ich noch nie gesehen, sich zu diesem Buche, zu besserer Betrachtung des Todes, wohl schicket. Man sollte es wohl vor Schwein-Leder ansehen.|author=Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach|source=''Merkwürdige Reisen durch Niedersachsen, Holland und Engelland''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10799313_00210.html|title=MDZ-Reader  - Band  - Herrn Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach Merkwürdige Reisen durch Niedersachsen, Holland und Engelland / Uffenbach, Zacharias Konrad von  - Herrn Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach Merkwürdige Reisen durch Niedersachsen, Holland und Engelland / Uffenbach, Zacharias Konrad von|website=reader.digitale-sammlungen.de|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Quote|text=(We also saw a little duodecimo, ''Molleri manuale præparationis ad mortem''. There seemed to be nothing remarkable about it, and you couldn't understand why it was here until you read in the front that it was bound in human leather. This unusual binding, the like of which I had never before seen, seemed especially well adapted to this book, dedicated to more meditation about death. You would take it for pig skin.)|author=translated by Lawrence S. Thompson|source=''Religatum de Pelle Humana''&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, ''Religatum de Pelle Humana'', page 135&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the [[French Revolution]], there were rumours that a [[tannery]] for human skin had been established at [[Meudon]] outside Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbloom, ''Lapham's Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carnavalet Museum]] owns a volume containing the [[French Constitution of 1793]] and ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man]]'' described as 'passing for being made in human skin imitating calf'.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbloom, ''Lapham's Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of well-attested anthropodermic bindings date from the 19th century.

Surviving examples of human skin bindings have often been commissioned, performed, or collected by medical doctors, who have access to [[cadaver]]s, sometimes those of executed criminals, such as the case of [[John Horwood]] in 1821 and the [[Red Barn Murder#Execution and dissection|Red Barn Murder]] in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/3573244.stm|title=Killer cremated after 180 years|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 July 2007 | date=17 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another tradition, with less supporting evidence, is that books of [[erotica]]&lt;ref name="Thompson1946"&gt;{{cite book|first=Lawrence|last=Thompson|authorlink=Lawrence S.

The [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] preserves a notebook bound in the skin of the murderer [[Burke and Hare murders|William Burke]] after his execution and subsequent public dissection by Professor [[Alexander Monro (tertius)|Alexander Monro]] in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;[https://museum.rcsed.ac.uk/the-collection/key-collections/key-object-page/pocketbook-made-from-burkes-skin Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6kJlKpAQ6?url=https://museum.rcsed.ac.uk/the-collection/key-collections/key-object-page/pocketbook-made-from-burkes-skin |date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What Lawrence Thompson called "the most famous of all anthropodermic bindings" is exhibited at the [[Boston Athenaeum]], titled ''[[Narrative of the Life of James Allen|The Highwayman: Narrative of the Life of James Allen alias George Walton]]''. It is by [[James Allen (highwayman)|James Allen]], who made his [[deathbed confession]] in 1837 and asked for a copy bound in his own skin to be presented to a man he once tried to rob and admired for his bravery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.bostonathenaeum.org/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=353244|title=Narrative of the life of James Allen, alias George Walton, alias Jonas Pierce, alias James H.

The [[Newberry Library]] in Chicago owns an Arabic manuscript written in 1848, with a handwritten note that it is bound in human skin, though "it is the opinion of the conservation staff that the binding material is not human skin, but rather highly burnished goat". This book is mentioned in the novel ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife]]'', much of which is set in the Newberry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newberry.org/time-traveler-s-wife|title=Time Traveler’s Wife - Newberry|website=www.newberry.org|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]]'s book ''Les terres du ciel'' (The Worlds of the Sky) (1877) was bound with the skin donated from a female admirer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hlrecord.org/?p=12516|title=Books Bound in Human Skin; Lampshade Myth? - The Harvard Law Record|website=hlrecord.org|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of the binding in the copy of [[Dale Carnegie]]'s ''[[Lincoln the Unknown]]'' that is part of the collection of [[Temple University]]'s Charles L. Blockson Collection was "taken from the skin of a Negro at a Baltimore Hospital and tanned by the Jewell Belting Company".&lt;ref&gt;Temple University Libraries and Charles L. Blockson, ''Catalogue of the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection: A Unit of the Temple University Libraries'', Temple University Press, 1990, p. 16. {{ISBN|0877227497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Library of Australia]] holds a book of 18th century poetry with the inscription "Bound in human skin" on the first page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/poems-bound-up-in-a-human-skin/2250959.aspx|title=Poems bound up in a human skin|publisher=Canberra Times|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition of fine bindings at the [[Grolier Club]] in 1903 included, in a section of 'Bindings in Curious Materials', three editions of Holbein's '[[Danse Macabre|''Dance of Death'']]' in 19th century human skin bindings;&lt;ref&gt;The Grolier Club of the City of New York.

Other examples of the Dance of Death include an 1856 edition offered at auction by [[Leonard Smithers]] in 1895&lt;ref&gt;Callum James, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101017031405/callumjames.blogspot.com/2009/05/leonard-smithers-human-skin-binding.html Leonard Smithers: Human Skin Binding], ''Front Free Endpaper'' (May 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and an 1842 edition from the personal library of [[Florin Abelès]] was [http://www.auction.fr/_fr/lot/reliure-en-peau-humaine-la-danse-des-morts-hellip-1203059 offered at auction] by Piasa of Paris in 2006.

== Identification ==

The identification of human skin bindings has been attempted by examining the pattern of [[hair follicles]], to distinguish human skin from that of other animals typically used for bookbinding, such as calf, sheep, goat, and pig. This is a necessarily subjective test, made harder by the distortions in the process of treating leather for binding. Testing a [[DNA]] sample is possible in principle, but DNA can be destroyed when skin is tanned, it degrades over time, and it can be contaminated by human readers.&lt;ref&gt;The Anthropodermic Book Project,
[https://anthropodermicbooks.org/about/the-science/ The Science], checked 13 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, [[peptide mass fingerprinting]] (PMF) and [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI) have recently been used to identify the material of bookbindings. A tiny sample is extracted from the book's covering and the [[collagen]] analysed by [[mass spectrometry]] to identify the variety of [[proteins]] which are characteristic of different species. PMF can identify skin as belonging to a [[primate]]; since monkeys were almost never used as a source of skin for bindings, this implies human skin.

The Historical Medical Library of the [[College of Physicians of Philadelphia]] owns five anthropodermic books, confirmed by [[peptide mass fingerprinting]] in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;Beth Lander, [http://histmed.collegeofphysicians.org/welcome/ Fugitive Leaves]&lt;/ref&gt; of which three were bound from the skin of one woman.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Lander, [http://histmed.collegeofphysicians.org/skin-she-lived-in/ The Skin She Lived In: Anthropodermic Books in the Historical Medical Library]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the largest collection of such books in one institution. The books can be seen in the associated [[Mütter Museum]].

The [[John Hay Library]] at [[Brown University]] owns four anthropodermic books, also confirmed by PMF:&lt;ref&gt;John Hay Library.[http://library.brown.edu/hay/faq.php#7 Frequently Asked Questions: Is it true the John Hay Library has books bound in human skin?]&lt;/ref&gt; Vesalius's [[De Humani Corporis Fabrica]], two nineteenth-century editions of Holbein's ''[[Dance of Death]]'', and ''Mademoiselle Giraud, My Wife'' (1891).

Three books in the libraries of [[Harvard University]] have been reputed to be bound in human skin, but peptide mass fingerprinting has confirmed only one, [http://id.lib.harvard.edu/aleph/005786452/catalog ''Des destinées de l'ame'' by Arsène Houssaye], held in the [[Houghton Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Heather. "[http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/houghton/2014/06/04/caveat-lecter/ Caveat Lecter]", ''Houghton Library Blog''. June 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (The other two books at Harvard were determined to be bound in sheepskin, the first being [http://id.lib.harvard.edu/aleph/005593425/catalog Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''] held in the Countway Library, the second being a treatise on Spanish law, ''[http://id.lib.harvard.edu/aleph/004317553/catalog Practicarum quaestionum circa leges regias Hispaniae]'', held in the library of [[Harvard Law School]].&lt;ref name=HLSblog&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etseq.law.harvard.edu/2014/04/852-rare-old-books-new-technologies-and-the-human-skin-book-at-hls/ |work=The Harvard Law School Library Blog |title=852 RARE: Old Books, New Technologies, and "The Human Skin Book" at HLS |author=Karen Beck |date=April 3, 2014 |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The Harvard skin book belonged to Dr Ludovic Bouland of Strasbourg, who owned a second, [http://search.wellcomelibrary.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb1283248 ''De integritatis &amp; corruptionis virginum notis''], now in the [[Wellcome Library]] in London. The Wellcome also owns a notebook labelled as bound in the skin of 'the Negro whose Execution caused the War of Independence', presumably [[Crispus Attucks]], but the library doubts that it is actually human skin.

Peptide mass fingerprinting was also used to determine the binding material for a miniature devotional book in the University of California's [[Bancroft Library]], [http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b10357222~S1 ''L'office de l'Eglise en françois'']. It is now known not to be bound in human skin but horse hide, or a mixture of horse and goatskin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/07/25/summer-myth-busters-tackle-campus-tall-tales/ Summer myth-busters tackle campus tall tales], Berkeley News.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
{{inpopularculture|date=September 2018}}
The binding of books in human skin is also a common element within horror films and works of fiction.

'''Fiction'''
* In [[H.P. Lovecraft]]'s horror story '[[The Hound]]' (1922), the narrator and his friend St John, who are graverobbers, have a collection of macabre artefacts. Amongst them, "A locked portfolio, bound in tanned human skin, held certain unknown and unnameable drawings which it was rumoured [[Goya]] had perpetrated but dared not acknowledge."&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Lovecraft, ''Dagon &amp; Other Macabre Tales''. Sauk City, WI: Arkham House, 1965, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[David H. Keller]]'s short story "Binding Deluxe", first published in ''[[Marvel Tales]]'' (May 1934), a bookbinder uses the skins of the men she murders to create a "deluxe" binding for a set of ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.
* In [[Brian Lumley]]'s story 'Billy's Oak' (1970), a book, the ''Cthaat Aquadingen'', is bound in human skin. Although over 400 years old, it still sweats.
*[[P. C. Hodgell]]'s Kencyr series (1982 onwards) features "the Book Bound in Pale Leather", which appears to be bound in living human skin.
*[[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s novel ''[[Lullaby (Palahniuk novel)|Lullaby]]'' (2002) features a book bound in human skin called "The [[Grimoire]]".
* In the novel ''The Journal of Dora Damage'' (2008) by Belinda Starling, a bookbinder is brought "leather" by a client with which to undertake a "special binding" of this nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novák|first1=Caterina|title=Those Very ‘Other’ Victorians: Interrogating Neo-Victorian Feminism in The Journal of Dora Damage|journal=Neo-Victorian Studies|date=2013|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.neovictorianstudies.com/past_issues/6-2%202013/NVS%206-2-5%20C-Novak.pdf|accessdate=30 November 2015|issn=1757-9481}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Linda Fairstein]]'s mystery novel ''Lethal Legacy'' (2009), a book collector shows investigators an 1828 book of trial proceedings that is bound with the skin of a convicted murderer.
* In the novel ''The Eye of God'' (2013) by [[James Rollins]], Vigor receives a package from Father Josip Tarasco that contains a skull and an ancient book bound in human skin. 
* In “The Book Of Life” by Deborah Harkness (the final book in the A Discovery of Witches trilogy) the book is made entirely of human / creature materials including the binding, ink, and paper.

'''Television and cinema'''
*In the ''[[The Evil Dead (franchise)|Evil Dead]]'' series of films and comic books originally created by [[Sam Raimi]] in 1981, a fictional [[Sumer]]ian book called the ''[[Necronomicon|Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]]'' is bound in human skin and inked with human blood.
*In the [[Disney]] film ''[[Hocus Pocus (movie)|Hocus Pocus]]'' (1993), the eldest Sanderson sister's (played by [[Bette Midler]]) fictional spellbook is bound in a patchwork of human skin with an enchanted, moving human eye embedded in the cover.
*[[Peter Greenaway]]'s 1996 film ''[[The Pillow Book (movie)|The Pillow Book]]'' contains a sequence in which the body of a writer's lover is exhumed by an obsessed publisher; and his skin, which she wrote upon after his death, is painstakingly tanned and bound into a book.
*The eponymous book in the Canadian television series ''[[Todd and the Book of Pure Evil]]'' (2010) is allegedly bound in human skin.
*In the episode "Like a Virgin" (2011) of the TV series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', the book containing the spell to release the Mother of All is printed (rather than bound) on human skin.

'''Video games'''
*In the video game ''[[Shadow Hearts (video game)|Shadow Hearts]]'' (2001), one of the characters is able to use a book bound from human skin as a weapon.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

In biology, a '''blastomere''' is a type of [[Cell (biology)|cell]] produced by [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] (cell division) of the [[zygote]] after [[fertilization]] and is an essential part of [[blastula]] formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/69084/blastomere Blastomere  Encyclopædia Britannica]. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 06 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human blastomere==

In humans, '''blastomere''' formation begins immediately following fertilization and continues through the first week of [[embryonic development]].  About 90 minutes after fertilization, the [[zygote]] divides into two cells.  These [[mitosis|mitotic division]]s continue and result in a grouping of cells called blastomeres. During this process, the total size of the [[embryo]] does not increase, so each division results in smaller and smaller cells.  When the zygote contains 16 to 32 blastomeres it is referred to as a "[[morula]]."

===Clinical disorders===

It is possible for errors to occur during this process of repetitive cell division.  Common among these errors is for the [[DNA|genetic material]] to not be divided evenly.  Normally, when a cell divides each daughter cell has the same genetic material as the parent cell.  If the genetic material does not split evenly between the two daughter cells, an event called "[[nondisjunction]]" occurs.  Since this event occurs in only one of the several cells that exist at this point, the embryo will continue to develop but will have some normal cells and some abnormal cells.  The people are "mosaics" of normal and abnormal cells, so this disorder is called "[[Mosaic (genetics)|numerical mosaicism]]".

'''''Cheburashka''''' ({{lang-rus|Чебура́шка|a=ru-Cheburashka.ogg|p=tɕɪbʊˈraʂkə}}), also known as '''''Topple''''' in earlier English translations, is a character in children's literature, from a 1966 story by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] writer [[Eduard Uspensky]]. He is also the protagonist (voiced by [[Klara Rumyanova]]) of the [[stop-motion]] [[animated film]]s by [[Roman Abelevich Kachanov|Roman Kachanov]] ([[Soyuzmultfilm]] studio), the first film of which was made in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uspens.info/state/AC:-1.1600625533/AA:navID.87/AB:navID.87/ Список фильмов]" (in Russian).

==Story==
Cheburashka is an iconic Russian classic cartoon character who later became a popular character in Russian jokes (along with his friend, [[Gena the Crocodile]]).  According to the creator of the character, Eduard Uspensky (1965), Cheburashka is an "animal unknown to science", with large monkey-like ears and a body resembling that of a cub, who lives in a tropical forest. He accidentally gets into a crate of oranges, eats his fill, and falls asleep. The crate is eventually delivered to a grocery store in an unnamed Russian city (hinted to be [[Moscow]]), where the rest of the main story unfolds.

The puzzled store manager finds the creature in the crate when he opens it, and takes him out and sits him on the table. The creature's paws are numb after staying in the crate for so long, and he tumbles down ("чебурахнулся" ''cheburakhnulsya'', a Russian colloquialism meaning "tumbled") from the table, onto the chair, and then onto the floor. This inspires the store manager to name the little creature "Cheburashka". Words with this root were archaic in Russian; Uspensky gave them a new lease on life. (''The [[Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language]]'' of [[Vladimir Dahl]] gives the meaning of "cheburashka" as another name for the [[roly-poly toy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author= Dahl, Vladimir |encyclopedia=The Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language: Er-Ve |title=Чебурашка |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2O8GAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B0#search_anchor|language=Russian |year= 1882 |publisher= Изд.

===Cheburashka and friends===
Cheburashka is male, has a bear-like body, large round ears, and is about the size of a 5-year-old child.  After being turned down by the zoo as an "animal unknown to science," Cheburashka gets hired as a window display for a discount store selling [[factory seconds]] because he resembles one, residing in a phone booth. In the tale, he befriends an anthropomorphic crocodile named [[Gena the Crocodile|Gena]], who wears a hat, a bow tie and a coat, and plays the accordion. Gena works in a zoo as a zoo animal. Gena's favorite songs are "Such a Pity that One's Birthday Happens Only Once a Year" and "The Blue Train Car," both of which are extremely popular with children.

===Antagonist===
In the cartoon, Cheburashka and Gena have their adventures made more difficult by a character named "Старуха Шапокляк" (Old Lady [[Shapoklyak]], from French ''chapeau claque'', a kind of collapsible [[top hat]]). Shapoklyak is a mischievous but charming old lady. She is tall and thin, wears a hat, a dark-coloured dress, and bloomers, and carries around a pet rat, Lariska, in her purse to help her play pranks on people, though near the end of some stories she turns around and helps the protagonists. The chorus of her theme song contains her motto, "One won't ever get famous for good deeds."

==Copyright issues==
[[File:Cheburashka A.V. Alfeevskiy 1965.jpg|thumb|Cheburashka in 1965, in the first edition of the book.]]
The rights to the Cheburashka character and image have been heavily debated in court.&lt;ref&gt;Sheveleva, Aleksandra (December 13, 2006). "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/russia/newsid_6176000/6176377.stm Чебурашку разбирают в суде]" (in Russian). [[BBC News Online]]. Retrieved 2009-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, [[Eduard Uspensky]] (the writer) copyrighted the character's name and image and proceeded to sell the rights to various countries. [[Leonid Shvartsman]], the art director of the animated films, has tried to prove in court that he was the creator of Cheburashka's visual appearance and that this copyright should be separate from the rights for the literary character. On 13 March 2007, Shvartsman and his lawyer lost a 4.7 million [[Russian ruble|ruble]] lawsuit against [[BRK Cosmetics]] and Eduard Uspensky. Shvartsman alleged that Uspensky sold the rights to the Cheburashka image (which was allegedly not his to sell) to BRK Cosmetics, which used it on packets of [[toothpaste]]. The defence argued that the artist who drew the character for the packets had never seen the animated films and, despite the fact that the character on the packets was an exact copy of the one in the animated films, had created the character himself after the impressions left from reading Uspensky's books. Vladimir Entin, defender of Shvartsman's interests, suspects that the jury had to have been bribed in order to hand such an unlikely verdict, but admits that there is no proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Anufrieva, Anna|date=March 13, 2007|url=http://www.dp.ru/msk/news/money/2007/03/13/208133/|script-title=ru:Как заработать на Чебурашке|language=Russian|work=Delovoy Peterburg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322054002/http://www.dp.ru/msk/news/money/2007/03/13/208133/|archivedate=March 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cheburashka sightings==
[[File:Antonov An-72 Cheburashka.jpg|thumb|The [[Antonov An-72]] is said to resemble Cheburashka when viewed from the front.]]
Cheburashka is now a staple of Russian cartoons, and there are several licensed products on the market, such as children's joke books and stuffed toys. He is also one of the few Russian animation characters to be the subject of numerous [[Russian joke]]s and riddles.

The word "Cheburashka" is also used in a figurative sense to name objects that somehow resemble the creature (such as an [[An-72]] aircraft which, when seen from the front, resembles the character's head) or are just as pleasing as it is (e.g. a colloquial name for a small bottle of [[lemonade]] – from the brand name "Cheburashka").

Cheburashka was also chosen as the official mascot with the main mascots for the Russian Olympic Team in the following games:
* [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Greece]] 
* [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], [[Italy]] (with white fur)
* [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]] (with red fur)
* [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]] (with blue fur)

''Cheburashka'' also became known in some countries outside the former Soviet Union (and of the [[Soviet Bloc]]). He became very popular in [[Japan]] after an animated film series about him was shown in 15 cinemas all over Japan and was watched by about 700,000 between summer 2001 and spring 2002. In 2008, the Cheburashka films (as part of the "[[Ghibli Museum Library]]") were made available to Japanese cinemas&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/cheb/top.html {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the same date as [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghibli.jp/ponyo/top.html {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An English-dubbed edition of at least one of the animated films was released in 1987, titled ''The Adventures of Charlie and Cubby.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/adventures-of-charlie-cubby-925|title=The Adventures of Charlie &amp; Cubby (1987) -  - Synopsis, Characteristics, Moods, Themes and Related - AllMovie|website=AllMovie|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Drutten och Gena", Sweden ===
[[Image:Druttenochgena.jpg|thumb|Screenshot from "Drutten och Gena"]]
In the 1970s a series of children's television shows, radio shows, records and magazines were produced in [[Sweden]] with the characters Drutten and crocodile Gena. These two characters were based on a couple of Cheburashka and Gena dolls bought on a trip to the Soviet Union, so they were visually identical to Cheburashka and Gena. ("Drutten" means "one who tumbles down", as one meaning of the Swedish colloquial verb "drutta" is "to fall or tumble down".)

But that is where the similarity ends. The two characters sang and told different stories from those in the USSR, lived on a bookshelf rather than in a city and are [[hand puppet]]s operated in [[live action]] rather than stop motion. Only occasionally Swedish public service TV would broadcast a segment of the Russian original, dubbed in Swedish. So, while many Swedes may visually recognize Cheburashka, they will generally not associate these characters with the ones Russian children know.

===Collectables===
Cheburashka dolls and other collectables are produced in Russia, Japan and China. United States National Champion figure skater [[Johnny Weir]] is known to be an avid collector of Russian Cheburashka items.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Johnny Weir Online: The Official Site, Q&amp;A |url=http://www.figureskatersonline.com/johnnyweir/interact12.html |date=July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504212417/http://www.figureskatersonline.com/johnnyweir/interact12.html |archivedate=May 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The white and red Olympic mascots were made in three sizes &amp;ndash; 14&amp;nbsp;cm, 18&amp;nbsp;cm and 27&amp;nbsp;cm &amp;ndash; and wear a sponsor's jersey with the "Bosco Sport" logo on the chest.

T-shirts with Cheburashka are common, including several versions with the character drawn as [[Alberto Korda]]'s [[Che Guevara]] photograph, labeled "Che Burashka".

==Cheburashka film==
[[Ivan Maximov]] had said in a 2004 interview&lt;ref&gt;Rasskazova, Tatyana (16 August 2004) "[http://www.ogoniok.com/archive/2004/4860/33-50-52/ Иван Максимов: по дешевке «Симпсонов» не сделаешь]" (in Russian). ''[[Ogoniok]]'' '''33''' (4860). Retrieved 2009-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Pilot Studio]] had been planning to make a ''Cheburashka'' feature film and that the scenario had been written out and possibly some footage shot, but that it had been frozen for lack of funds. Cheburashka's popularity in Japan is such that on 4 April 2006, [[TV Tokyo]] broadband issued a press announcement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ozler, Levent|date=April 12, 2006 |url=https://www.dexigner.com/news/7757|title=Cheburash : Animation Phenomenon Goes to TV Tokyo Broadband|publisher=Dexigner}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it (in partnership with [[Frontier Works]]) has acquired the rights to remake the Cheburashka shorts as a feature film. It is unclear if this was the project that Pilot Studio had been forced to abandon. It was announced that the film, like the original shorts, will be based on puppet animation enhanced with modern [[Stop motion|stop-motion]] technology and computer graphics effects (similar to the plans for the Pilot Studio film), and would be shot simultaneously in English and Russian.

In March 2009 it was announced that the new Cheburashka animation would consist of a new animated series, called ''[[Cheburashka arere?]]'', which will last for 26 3-minute episodes. ''Cheburashka arere?'' premiered on the ''Nori-Suta 100%'' television program on 7 October 2009.

The new film, only titled ''Cheburashka''&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-09-03/russia-cheburashka-character-gets-japanese-tv-anime Russia's Cheburashka Character Gets Japanese TV Anime]".

Directed by [[Makoto Nakamura]] and written by both [[Mikhail Aldashin]] and [[Michiru Shimada]]. The film opened in 8 December 2010 in Japan. The film's theme song is titled ''Orange'', performed by [[Kaela Kimura]].

The '''Dehaene–Changeux model''' ('''DCM'''), also known as the '''global neuronal workspace''' or the '''global cognitive workspace model''' is a part of [[Bernard Baars]]'s "[[Global Workspace Theory|global workspace model]]" for consciousness.

It is a [[computer model]] of the [[neural correlates of consciousness]] programmed as a [[neural network]].

==History==
The Dehaene–Changeux model was initially established as a [[spin glass]] neural network attempting to represent [[learning]] and to then provide a stepping stone towards [[machine learning|artificial learning]] among other objectives. It would later be used to predict observable reaction times within the [[Priming (psychology)|priming paradigm]]&lt;ref&gt;Epub 2010 Jan 25.

Conscious Cogn. 2010 Mar;19(1):86–97..&lt;/ref&gt; and in inattentional blindness.

==Structure==

===General structure===
The Dehaene–Changeux model is a meta neural network (i.e. a network of neural networks) composed of a very large number of [[integrate-and-fire]] [[neuron]]s programmed in either a [[stochastic]] or deterministic way. The neurons are organised in complex [[Thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits|thalamo-cortical columns]] with long-range connexions and a critical role {{clarify|date=November 2011}} played by the interaction between [[Constantin von Economo|von Economo's areas]]. Each thalamo-cortical column is composed of [[pyramidal cell]]s and [[Interneuron|inhibitory interneurons]] receiving a long-distance excitatory [[Neuromodulation (biology)|neuromodulation]] which could represent [[noradrenergic]] input.

===A swarm and a multi-agent system composed of neural networks===
{{Synthesis|section|date=November 2011}}
Among others Cohen &amp; Hudson (2002) had already used "''Meta neural networks as intelligent agents for diagnosis ''"&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, M.E.;  Hudson, D.L.;  Meta neural networks as intelligent agents for diagnosis Neural Networks, 2002. IJCNN '02. Proceedings of the 2002 International Joint Conference on 233 – 238&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Cohen &amp; Hudson, Dehaene &amp; Changeux have established their model as an interaction of meta-neural networks (thalamocortical columns) themselves programmed in the manner of a "''hierarchy of neural networks that together act as an intelligent agent''", in order to use them as a system composed of a large scale of inter-connected intelligent agents for predicting the self-organized behaviour of the neural correlates of consciousness. It may also be noted that Jain et al. (2002) had already clearly identified [[spiking neuron]]s as intelligent agents&lt;ref&gt;L. C. Jain, Zhengxin Chen, Nikhil Ichalkaranje Intelligent agents and their applications Volume 98 de Studies in fuzziness and soft computing&lt;/ref&gt; since the lower bound for computational power of networks of [[Artificial neuron|spiking neurons]] is the capacity to simulate in real-time for boolean-valued inputs any [[Turing machine]].&lt;ref&gt;Maas, W. Lower Bound for the computational power of networks of spking neurons [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.933]&lt;/ref&gt; The '''DCM''' being composed of a very large number of interacting sub-networks which are themselves intelligent agents, it is formally a [[Multi-agent system]] programmed as a [[Swarm]] or neural networks and ''a fortiori'' of spiking neurons.

The authors provide the legend: "Shown are the constituents of the simulation (upper diagrams) and typical patterns of spontaneous activity that they can produce (lower tracings). We simulated a nested architecture in which spiking neurons (A) are incorporated within thalamocortical columns (B), which are themselves interconnected hierarchically by local and long-distance cortical connections (C) (see ''Materials and methods'' for details). While single neurons may generate sustained oscillations of [[membrane potential]]s (A), only the column and network levels generate complex waxing-and-waning [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]-like oscillations (B) and [[metastable]] global states of sustained firing (C)."&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux J-P (2005) '''Ongoing Spontaneous Activity Controls Access to Consciousness: A Neuronal Model for Inattentional Blindness.'''

==Behavior==
The DCM exhibits several surcritical {{clarify|date=November 2011}} [[Emergence|emergent behaviors]] such as [[multistability]] and a [[Hopf bifurcation]] between two very different regimes which may represent either [[sleep]] or [[arousal]] with a various [[all-or-none]] behaviors which Dehaene et al. use to determine a testable taxonomy between different states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP, Naccache L, Sackur J, Sergent C. '''Conscious, preconscious, and subliminal processing: a testable taxonomy.''' Trends Cogn Sci. 2006 May;10(5):204-11. Epub 2006 Apr 17.&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|date=November 2011}}

==Scholarly reception==

===Self-organized criticality===
The Dehaene-Changeux Model contributed to the study of [[nonlinearity]] and [[self-organized criticality]] in particular as an explanatory model of the brain's emergent behaviors, including consciousness. Studying the brain's phase-locking and large-scale synchronization, Kitzbichler et al. (2011a) confirmed that criticality is a property of human brain functional network organization at all frequency intervals in the brain's physiological bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzbichler MG, Smith ML, Christensen SR, Bullmore E. '''Broadband criticality of human brain network synchronization.''' PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009 Mar;5(3):e1000314. Epub 2009 Mar 20. {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, exploring the neural dynamics of cognitive efforts after, ''inter alia'', the Dehaene-Changeux Model, Kitzbichler et al. (2011b) demonstrated how cognitive effort breaks the [[modularity of mind]] to make human brain functional networks transiently adopt a more efficient but less economical configuration.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzbichler MG, Henson RN, Smith ML, Nathan PJ, Bullmore ET. '''Cognitive effort drives workspace configuration of human brain functional networks.''' J Neurosci. 2011 Jun 1;31(22):8259-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Werner (2007a) used the Dehaene-Changeux Global Neuronal Workspace to defend the use of statistical physics approaches for exploring phase transitions, scaling and universality properties of the so-called "Dynamic Core" of the brain, with relevance to the macroscopic electrical activity in [[EEG]] and [[Electromyography|EMG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cogprints.org/5275/1/BrainDynamics.pdf Werner G. '''Brain dynamics across levels of organization.''' J Physiol Paris. 2007 Jul–Nov;101(4–6):273-9. Epub 2008 Jan 8.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, building from the Dehaene-Changeux Model, Werner (2007b) proposed that the application of the twin concepts of scaling and universality of the theory of non-equilibrium phase transitions can serve as an informative approach for elucidating the nature of underlying neural-mechanisms, with emphasis on the dynamics of recursively [[Reentry (neural circuitry)|reentrant]] activity flow in intracortical and cortico-subcortical neuronal loops. [[Karl Friston|Friston]] (2000) also claimed that "''the nonlinear nature of asynchronous coupling enables the rich, context-sensitive interactions that characterize real brain dynamics, suggesting that it plays a role in functional integration that may be as important as synchronous interactions''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1692735/pdf/10724457.pdf | pmc=1692735 | pmid=10724457 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0560 | volume=355 | title=The labile brain.

===States of consciousness and phenomenology===
It contributed to the study of phase transition in the brain under sedation, and notably GABA-ergic sedation such as that induced by propofol (Murphy et al. 2011, Stamatakis et al. 2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coma.ulg.ac.be/papers/vs/murphy_propofol.pdf Murphy M, Bruno MA, Riedner BA, Boveroux P, Noirhomme Q, Landsness EC, Brichant JF, Phillips C, Massimini M, Laureys S, Tononi G, Boly M.Propofol '''anesthesia and sleep: a high-density EEG study.'''

'''Squadron Commander Edwin Harris Dunning''', [[Distinguished Service Cross (UK)|DSC]] (17 July 1892 – 7 August 1917), of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Naval Air Service]], was the first pilot to land an aircraft on a moving ship.

==Early life==
Dunning was born in South Africa&lt;ref&gt;[[United Kingdom Census 1901|1901 Census of Eastbourne]] - RG13/880 Folio 34 Page 11 (10, Landsdowne Terrace, Eastbourne)&lt;/ref&gt; on 17 July 1892 the second child of Sir Edwin Harris Dunning of Jacques Hall, [[Bradfield, Essex]], he was educated at Royal Naval Colleges at [[Royal Naval College, Osborne|Osborne]] and [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Dartmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crossandcockade.com/files/DSC%20and%20DSM%20Awards%20to%20RNAS.xls |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711105325/http://www.crossandcockade.com/files/DSC%20and%20DSM%20Awards%20to%20RNAS.xls |archivedate=11 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First landing on a moving ship==
[[File:Dunning killed on second carrier landing IWM Q 80597.jpg|thumb|Dunning's Sopwith Pup veering off the flight deck of HMS Furious during his fatal attempt to land on the carrier while underway.]]
Dunning landed his [[Sopwith Pup]] on {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} in [[Scapa Flow]], [[Orkney]] on 2 August 1917.  He was killed five days later, during his third landing attempt of the day, when an updraft caught his port wing, throwing his plane overboard. Knocked unconscious, he [[drowned]] in the cockpit.&lt;ref&gt;The First World War: A Complete History by Sir [[Martin Gilbert]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ob2k5aM15cEC&amp;pg=RA2-PA355&amp;lpg=RA2-PA355&amp;dq=edwin+dunning+navy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=i9QLved3Jz&amp;sig=gOm_HN09wJpfliOShKn0iuoAoIY&amp;hl=en]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried at St Lawrence's Church, Bradfield, beside his mother. A plaque in the church states: {{quote|The Admiralty wish you to know what great service he performed for the Navy. It was in fact a demonstration of landing an Aeroplane on the deck of a Man-of-War whilst the latter was under way. This had never been done before;and the data obtained was of the utmost value. It will make Aeroplanes indispensable to a fleet;&amp; possibly, revolutionise Naval Warfare. The risk taken by Squadron Commander Dunning needed much courage. He had already made two successful landings;but expressed a wish to land again himself, before other Pilots did so;and in this last run he was killed. My Lords desire to place on record their sense of the loss to the Naval Service of this gallant Officer.}}

In memory of Dunning, the Dunning Cup or Dunning Memorial Cup is given annually to the officer who is considered to have done most to further aviation in connection with the Fleet for the year in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=|first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=21 July 1921 |title=Dunning Cup - Award for 1920|journal=Flight|pages=495 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200495.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s it was awarded to Royal Air Force squadrons which achieve the highest standard on courses at the Joint Anti-Submarine School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=|first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=18 January 1962 |title=JASS Award |journal=Flight International|pages=102 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%200102.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ezio Marano '''(6 August 1927, [[Brescia]] – 26 April 1991, [[Rome]]) was an Italian actor.

== Biography ==
He made his debut in the theater in the mid-50s at the Piccolo in [[Milan]] under the guidance of [[Giorgio Strehler]], in a long series of performances in both Italian and the Lombard dialect; he then entered into more and more companies in smaller but significant parts, working simultaneously on television and [[Radio Rai]]. For television, he was among the performers on the TV drama {{ill|Napoleon a Sant'Elena|it}}, directed by [[Vittorio Cottafavi]] in 1973.

He made his debut in the cinema comparatively late, in 1969, under the direction of Mauro Severino, and continued his film career, with his last movie being [[Ginger and Fred]], directed by [[Federico Fellini]] in 1985. He died on 26 April 1991 by a lingering disease that had struck him three years earlier.

'''Giga Pets''' are [[digital pet]]s (also known as '''virtual pets''' or '''artificial pets''') that were first released in the [[United States]] by [[Tiger Electronics]] in 1997 in the midst of a virtual-pet toy fad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adage.com/article/news/tiger-striving-nurture-giga-pets-a-budget-virtual-pet-craze-spreads-marketers-fear-10-bite-outstrip-bark/68322/ Jensen, J. (1997). Tiger striving to nurture giga pets-on a budget.] Advertising Age, 68(19), 24-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Available in a variety of different characters, essentially each is a palm-sized video screen attached to a key ring.&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;Sullivan, B. (May 2, 1997). [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-05-02/business/9705020091_1_beanie-babies-six-pets-giga-pets Giga pets gear up to knock beanie babies from their cuddly, non-computerized throne.] Chicago Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure a happy, [[health]]y [[pet]], its [[owner]] has to take care of it in some of the same ways one might care for a real animal. Among other things, Giga Pets have to be fed, cleaned, and played with.

==Operation==
Giga Pets are "born" on a tiny [[LCD screen]] after the owner pulls back a tab on the back. The pets come to life in different ways. For example, Baby T-Rex hatches from an egg. Compu Kitty is delivered by a stork. A beep sound and alert icon notify the owner that the pet requires attention.&lt;ref name="Tribune" /&gt; To determine what the Giga Pet needs, owners must scroll through various activities and push a button to select one. Activities include but are not limited to bathing, exercising, and disciplining the pet. Sometimes a selected activity is refused and the owner has to try a different one.  A running score determines the pet’s overall well-being; neglect leads to the pet’s demise. The average life of a Giga Pet is 2 weeks but very healthy pets can live longer. When a Giga Pet dies it grows angel wings.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, C. A. (1997).

==History==
Giga Pets were first created (called "V-Pets") by Chicago Toy inventing firm REHCO LLC, licensed to Tiger Electronics prior to Tamagotchis, however launched later to compete with [[Tamagotchis]], egg-shaped virtual pets that were introduced in [[Japan]] in 1996 by [[Bandai]] and are widely credited with initiating the virtual pet craze in the U.S., the [[UK]], and other countries.&lt;ref name="Librarian"&gt;Clyde, A. (1998). Electronic pets. Emergency Librarian, 25(5), 34-36. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/224890209&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., Giga Pets were reported to be more readily available than Tamagotchis and at price of approximately $10 USD, roughly $5 less than the suggest retail price for their Japanese counterpart.&lt;ref name="Tribune" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=96 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=July 1997|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1997, Tiger Electronics, a then privately held electronics toy and game-maker based in [[Vernon Hills]], [[Illinois]], was one of many manufacturers creating virtual pets. Others included [[Fujitsu]], [[PF Magic]], [[Sega]], [[Viacom New Media]], [[Casio]], and [[Technosphere (company)|Technosphere]].&lt;ref name="Librarian" /&gt;

==Giga Pets and Furby==
Roger Shiffman, a [[Chicago]] native and co-founder of Tiger Electronics, is credited as being the driving force behind Giga Pets and [[Furby]],&lt;ref&gt;ANNE D'INNOCENZIO Associated, P. w.

Intended to be a follow up to Giga Pets, Shiffman included Furby in the deal he made with [[Hasbro]] when Tiger Electronics was sold to the giant toy manufacturer in 1998 for $335 million USD.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsner, S.

==Giga Pets 2018 relaunch==
Top Secret Toys LLC relaunched GigaPets August 1st 2018 after receiving the licensing rights from REHCO LLC. The virtual pets are made by the same manufacturer, programmers, and game designers from the 90s. Except this time they come with better animations and a free companion phone app that uses augmented reality to being the pixel pet to life. You don’t actually need to use the phone app, and you can still feel the same nostalgia of owning a GigaPet with or without the companion phone app. Top Secret Toys, the toy company responsible for the relaunch of GigaPets, aims to renew the customer engagement and nostalgia through design contests that allow the winners to see their pet designs get manufactured and sold.

==TV game and new handhelds launched in 2006==
Giga Pets Explorer TV Plug n Play Game was launched in the spring of 2006 along with new versions of Giga Pets handheld devices. The TV game came with three pets within the unit and one separate handheld unit (the hamster) and sold for approximately $40 USD. Handhelds were sold in a 12-package assortment of characters as well as individually. The characters Pixie, Tomcat, Puff Ball, Dragon Lizard, Scorpion and Bunny were all available individually at a suggested retail price of approximately $15 USD.&lt;ref&gt;Hasbro, inc. brings wide range of innovative toys, games and lifestyle products to toy fair 2006.

==Controversy==
Giga Pets, along with other virtual pets, were banned in some schools in different countries around the world including [[Iceland]], [[Thailand]], the [[U.S.]] and [[Canada]] primarily because they were deemed a distraction in the classroom. Common complaints included annoying beeping sounds and children’s constant worry over their pets’ well-being. Some parents felt Giga Pets were an ideal learning toy that taught children responsibility. Others worried their kids were becoming too attached.&lt;ref name="Librarian" /&gt;

Beyond the classroom, Giga Pets and their kind inspired debate over the implications of caring for virtual pets versus biological pets. Some people thought the on/off/reset switch implied to children that death wasn’t final and many people, some [[animal rights activists]] among them, believed that virtual pets taught children that caring for an animal was a matter of convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Dorin |first= A. |title= Artifact &amp; Artificial Life for Play |journal= Artificial Life |volume= 10 |issue= 1 |publisher= MIT Press |date= 2004 |pages= 99-112 
|url= http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~aland/PAPERS/Alife10_1_preprint.pdf |series= Preprint |format= pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Journal of American and Comparative Cultures article published in 2000, author, David W. Kritt, discussed the impact virtual pets had on young females in terms of gender [[stereotypes]]. Kritt claimed, “The implicit message to the predominantly female owners is that an emotional meaningful relationship is simply care and dependence. In contrast, flesh and blood pets provide mutuality, a relatively exclusive and enduring affection, and often some self-enhancing function.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Kritt |first= D. W. |date= 2000 |title= Loving a virtual pet: Steps toward the technological erosion of emotion |journal= Journal of American and Comparative Cultures |volume= 23 |issue= 4 |pages= 81-87 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/200590681 |subscription= yes |doi= 10.1111/j.1537-4726.2000.2304_81.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kritt went on to address the impact of virtual pets on girls and technology. He wrote: “Despite [[McLuhan]]’s trenchant insight that the medium is the message, the virtual pet may not be so much a point of entry intro [[cyberspace]] for girls as it is a promoter of traditional values.” Kritt argued that this message is amplified when a child’s parent, particularly her mother, focuses on helping the daughter keep the virtual pet alive.

'''Hotula Khan''' was a [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of [[Khamag Mongol]] and the son of [[Khabul Khan]], and thus great-uncle of the [[Genghis Khan]]. He died fighting the [[Tatars]]. No Mongol emerged as khan after him until Genghis Khan. His nephew [[Yesugei]] only supervised the [[Khamag Mongol]]s until his death in 1171.

'''HumanLight''' is a [[Humanism|Humanist]] [[List of winter festivals|holiday]] celebrated annually on December 23. HumanLight was first celebrated in 2001, and was created to provide a specifically Humanist celebration during the [[Western world|western world's]] [[holiday season]]. The New Jersey Humanist Network founded the holiday in 2001 to aid [[secular]] people in commemorating the December holiday season without encroaching on other adjacent holidays—both religious ones such as [[Christmas]] and secular ones such as [[Winter solstice|Solstice]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Huq17|HumanLight.org, 2017]]&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural event involved only the founding organization, but is now celebrated by many secular organizations and individuals across the United States and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spe12|Speckhardt, 2012]].&lt;/ref&gt; Various organizations have recognized the holiday, including the [[American Humanist Association]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ame04|American Humanist Association, 2004]]; [[#Win12|Winston, 2012]].&lt;/ref&gt; The HumanLight Committee maintains the official HumanLight webpage and engages with humanist organizations and the media about the holiday.

HumanLight is a secular holiday that focuses on the "positive, secular human values of reason, compassion, humanity and hope".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col11|Colucci, 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt; While there are no universally accepted ways to commemorate the holiday, modern celebrations typically involve a communal meal among a family or group. The use of candles to symbolize reason, hope, compassion, and humanity has become widespread among those celebrating. Groups today also observe the holiday using charity work, gift exchanges, and other ideas associated with holidays and celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Win12|Winston, 2012]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and meaning==
The name HumanLight comes from a non-[[supernatural]] emphasis on humanity with "Light" pointing to human reason.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col11|Colucci, 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt; The event is designed to celebrate the "positive human values of reason, compassion, humanity and hope".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Alj18|Aljazeera, 2018]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and history==
HumanLight's origins stem from members of the New Jersey Humanist Network asking in the late 1990s how secular people could best participate in the December holiday season.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hal12|Hallowell, 2012]].&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural event occurred at the Verona Park Boathouse in [[Verona, New Jersey]] on December 23, 2001, and was attended by nearly 100 people, including prominent Humanist [[Paul Kurtz]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ken06|Kennedy, 2006]]; [[#Tho01|Thorbourne, 2001]]; [[#Huz17|HumanLight.org, 2017]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Celebration of the holiday has expanded since its inaugural event. By 2010, there were at least thirty known public celebrations, and multiple secular organizations—including the American Humanist Association—had endorsed the holiday.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Win12|Winston, 2012]].&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremonies themselves have also evolved. The first event involved a meal among its participants, along with artistic performances and other activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho01|Thorbourne, 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, additional traditions have been added.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho01|Thorbourne, 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The December 23 date allows HumanLight to connect itself to the [[Christmas and holiday season|December holiday season]] without interfering with [[List of winter festivals|other winter holidays]] which many Humanists may also celebrate, such as [[Christmas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Huq17|HumanLight.org, 2017]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was by design, as Patrick Colucci of the HumanLight Committee has stated that "We're not out to take Christmas away from anyone who wants to celebrate it."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ste09|Sterling, 2009]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
[[File:HumanLight Candle Ceremony 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Candle display following a Candle Lighting ceremony during a HumanLight celebration in Germany in 2014]]
The HumanLight symbol was designed by a volunteer artist; the initial symbol appeared with a single figure, but was adjusted to include three figures in 2009 to reflect the "community nature" of the holiday.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Huy17|HumanLight.org, 2017]].&lt;/ref&gt; The current symbol "depicts the light of the sun, and human figures celebrating with arms outstretched. The font characters composing HumanLight are of a festive, decorative nature."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Huq17|HumanLight.org, 2017]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no universal traditions, but over time the use of candles has become significant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Win12|Winston, 2012]].&lt;/ref&gt; Candles and decorations have at times used the colors blue, red, and yellow/gold, to represent both the colors of the HumanLight symbol as well as reason, compassion, and hope.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Huw17|HumanLight.org, 2017]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are no set colors for candle-lighting ceremonies, and both three and four candle ceremonies have been seen, with a fourth candle representing humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col17|Colucci, 2017]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observance==
Although the first HumanLight celebration was with a large group at a public location, HumanLight is also celebrated as families or individuals, and can be in public or private venues, such as homes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col12|Colucci, 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt; There are no firm requirements for HumanLight celebrations. Even the date of celebration is flexible. For example, although HumanLight Day is December 23, if that date in a particular year falls on a weekday, organizers can schedule the celebration on the previous weekend, if needed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col12|Colucci, 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are no requirements, there are a wide variety of possible themes and events to include in a HumanLight ceremony or celebration. These include "science book exchanges," music, and children's activities, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wib12|Winston, 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt; Charitable works and donations are also common parts of HumanLight celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col12|Colucci, 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt; Private events at home tend to involve more disparate activities, but frequently involve a meal with family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col12|Colucci, 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt; The HumanLight Committee recommends keeping three principles central in any event: (1) promoting the positive values of Humanism, (2) avoiding negative messages related to other religions, and (3) keeping it family and children-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Huw17|HumanLight.org, 2017]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Juancito.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A [[mule]] is a [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]] hybrid of a male [[donkey]] and a female [[horse]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Griesbach/&gt;--&gt; Mules are smaller than horses but stronger than donkeys, making them useful as [[pack animal]]s.]]

In [[biology]], a '''hybrid''' is the result of combining the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through [[sexual reproduction]]. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in [[blending inheritance]]), but can show [[Heterosis|hybrid vigour]], often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In [[genetics]], attention is focused on the numbers of [[chromosome]]s. In taxonomy, a key question is how closely related the parent [[species]] are.

Species are [[reproductive isolation|reproductively isolated]] by strong barriers to hybridisation, which include morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before [[fertilization]] and others after it. Similar barriers exist in plants, with differences in flowering times, pollen vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility and the structure of the chromosomes. A few animal species and many plant species, however, are the result of [[hybrid speciation]], including important crop plants such as [[wheat]], where the number of chromosomes has been doubled&lt;!--among much else, too complex for lead--&gt;.

[[Human impact on the environment]] has resulted in an increase in the interbreeding between regional species, and with [[introduced species]] worldwide, which has resulted in an increase in hybridisation. The [[genetic mixing]] may threaten many species with extinction, while [[genetic erosion]] in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding.  A form of often intentional human-mediated hybridisation is the crossing of wild and domesticated species. This is common in both traditional [[horticulture]] and modern [[agriculture]]; many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs, and trees have been produced by hybridisation. One such flower, ''[[Oenothera lamarckiana]]'', was central to early genetics research into [[mutationism]] and polyploidy.  It is also more occasionally done in the livestock and pet trades; some well-known wild × domestic hybrids are [[beefalo]] and [[wolfdog]]s.  Human [[selective breeding]] of [[domesticated animals]] and [[Domesticated plants|plants]] has resulted is the development of distinct [[breeds]] (usually called [[cultivar]]s in reference to plants); [[crossbreed]]s between them (without any wild [[Foundation stock|stock]]) are sometimes also imprecisely referred to as "hybrids". 

[[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|Hybrid humans]] existed in prehistory. For example, [[Neanderthals]] and anatomically modern humans are thought to have interbred as recently as 40,000 years ago.

[[Mythological hybrid]]s appear in human culture in forms as diverse as the [[Minotaur]], blends of animals, humans and mythical beasts such as [[centaur]]s and [[sphinx]]es, and the [[Nephilim]] of the [[Biblical apocrypha]] described as the wicked sons of [[fallen angel]]s and attractive women.

==Etymology==
[[File:Liger.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Liger]], a lion/tiger hybrid bred in captivity]]

The term hybrid is derived from Latin ''{{lang|la|hybrida}}'', used for crosses such as of a tame sow and a wild boar. The term came into popular use in English in the 19th century, though examples of its use have been found from the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hybrid |title=Hybrid |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conspicuous hybrids are popularly named with [[portmanteau word]]s, starting in the 1920s with the breeding of tiger–lion hybrids ([[liger]] and [[tigon]]).&lt;ref&gt;"When the sire is a lion the result is termed a Liger, whilst the converse is a Tigon." Edward George Boulenger, ''World natural history'', B. T. Batsford ltd., 1937, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==As seen by different disciplines==

===Animal and plant breeding===

From the point of view of animal and plant breeders, there are several kinds of hybrid formed from crosses within a species, such as between different [[breeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wricke, Gunter; Weber, Eberhard |date=1986 |title=Quantitative genetics and selection in plant breeding |publisher=W. de Gruyter |page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Single cross hybrids result from the cross between two [[true-breeding organism]]s which produces an [[F1 hybrid]] (first filial generation). The cross between two different [[homozygous]] lines produces an F1 hybrid that is [[heterozygous]]; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is [[Dominance relationship#Dominant allele|dominant]] and the other [[Dominance relationship#Recessive allele|recessive]]. Typically, the F1 generation is also [[phenotype|phenotypically]] homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Principles of Molecular Medicine | editor1=Runge, Marschall S. |editor2=Patterson, Cam | publisher=Humana Press | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-58829-202-5 | page=58 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-_rAKRf3WwC&amp;pg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Double cross hybrids result from the cross between two different F1 hybrids (i.e., there are four unrelated grandparents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rawlings, J. O.; Cockerham, C. Clark |title=Analysis of Double Cross Hybrid Populations |journal=Biometrics |volume=18 |issue=2 |date=June 1962 |pages=229–244 |doi=10.2307/2527461}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Three-way cross hybrids result from the cross between an F1 hybrid and an inbred line. Triple cross hybrids result from the crossing of two different three-way cross hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson |first1=K. F. |title=Triple-cross hybrid kale |journal=Euphytica |date=1964 |volume=13 |page=173 |doi=10.1007/BF00033306 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00033306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Top cross (or "topcross") hybrids result from the crossing of a top quality or pure-bred male and a lower quality female, intended to improve the quality of the offspring, on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Topcross |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/topcross |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population hybrids result from the crossing of plants or animals in one [[population]] with those of another population. These include interspecific hybrids or crosses between different breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McCarthy |first=Eugene M. |title=Hybrid Populations |url=http://www.macroevolution.net/hybrid-populations.html |website=Macroevolution |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[horticulture]], the term stable hybrid is used to describe an [[annual plant]] that, if grown and bred in a small [[monoculture]] free of external [[pollen]] (e.g., an air-filtered greenhouse) produces offspring that are "true to type" with respect to phenotype; i.e., a true-breeding organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Toogood, A. |date=1999 |title=Plant Propagation |publisher=American Horticultural Society |isbn=0-7894-5520-X |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogeography===
{{further|Hybrid zone}}

Hybridisation can occur in the [[hybrid zone|zones where geographical subspecies overlap]]. For example, the butterfly  ''[[Limenitis arthemis]]'' has two major subspecies in North America, ''L. a. arthemis'' (the white admiral) and ''L. a. astyanax'' (the red-spotted purple). The white admiral has a bright, white band on its wings, while the red-spotted purple has cooler blue-green shades. Hybridisation occurs between a narrow area across New England, southern Ontario, and the Great Lakes, the "suture region". It is at these regions that the subspecies were formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ries, Leslie; Mullen, Sean P. |year=2008 |title=A Rare Model Limits the Distribution of Its More Common Mimic: A Twist on Frequency-Dependent Batesian Mimicry |journal=Evolution |volume=62 |issue=7 |pages=1798–803 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00401.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
[[File:Gruppenweise artbildung unter spezieller berücksichtigung der gattung Oenothera (Taf. II) (7164908226).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Oenothera lamarckiana]]'' is a permanent natural hybrid, studied intensively by the geneticist [[Hugo de Vries]]. Illustration by De Vries, 1913]]

From the point of view of genetics, several different kinds of hybrid can be distinguished.&lt;ref name=Rieger&gt;{{cite book |author=Rieger, R.; Michaelis A.; Green, M. M. |date=1991 |title=Glossary of Genetics: Classical and Molecular |edition=5th |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=0-387-52054-6 |page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007&gt;{{cite book |last=Allendorf |first=Fred |title=Conservation and the Genetics of Populations |year=2007 |publisher=Blackwell |page=534}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A genetic hybrid carries two different [[allele]]s of the same [[gene]], where for instance one allele may code for a lighter coat colour than the other.&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt; A structural hybrid results from the fusion of [[gamete]]s that have differing structure in at least one chromosome, as a result of [[Chromosome abnormality#Structural abnormalities|structural abnormalities]].&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt; A numerical hybrid results from the fusion of gametes having different [[Ploidy|haploid numbers of chromosomes]].&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt; A permanent hybrid results when only the heterozygous [[genotype]] occurs, as in ''[[Oenothera lamarckiana]]'',&lt;ref name="Sirks2013"/&gt; because all homozygous combinations are lethal.&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt; In the early history of genetics, [[Hugo De Vries]] supposed these were [[Mutationism|caused by mutation]].&lt;ref name=DeVries1901-1903&gt;{{cite book | author=De Vries, Hugo |authorlink=Hugo de Vries |year=1901–1903 | title= Die mutationstheorie. Vol I and II | publisher= Von Veit, Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Vries, Hugo |authorlink=Hugo de Vries |date=January 1919 |title=Oenothera rubrinervis; A Half Mutant |journal=Botanical Gazette |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=1–26 |jstor=2468868 |doi=10.1086/332396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxonomy===

From the point of view of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], hybrids differ according to their parentage.
Hybrids between different [[subspecies]] (such as between the [[Bengal tiger]] and [[Siberian tiger]]) are called intra-specific hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allendorf |first=Fred |title=Conservation and the Genetics of Populations |year=2007 |publisher=Blackwell |pages=421–448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interspecific hybrids are the offspring from [[interspecies mating]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Keeton, William T. |date=1980 |title=Biological Science |publisher=Norton |isbn=0-393-95021-2 |page=A9}}&lt;/ref&gt; these sometimes result in hybrid speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=M.L. |title=Natural Hybridisation and Evolution |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-509975-1 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergeneric hybrids result from matings between different genera, such as between [[Domestic sheep|sheep]] and [[goat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kelk, Dawn A.; Gartley, Cathy J.; Buckrell, Brian C.; King, W. Allan |title=The interbreeding of sheep and goats|journal=Canadian Veterinary Journal |date=1997 |volume=38 |pages=235–237 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1576582/pdf/canvetj00089-0049.pdf |pmc=1576582 |pmid=9105723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interfamilial hybrids, such as [[chicken hybrids|between chickens]] and [[guineafowl]] or [[pheasant]]s, are reliably described but extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnsgard |first1=Paul A. |title=Hybridisation &amp; Zoogeographic Patterns in Pheasants |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=johnsgard |publisher=University of Nebraska - Lincoln |accessdate=20 March 2017 |ref=Paul Johnsgard Collection. Paper 17 |date=1983 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interordinal hybrids (between different orders) are few, but have been made with the [[sea urchin]] ''[[Strongylocentrotus purpuratus]]'' (female) and the [[sand dollar]] ''[[Dendraster excentricus]]'' (male).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Giudice |first=Giovanni |title=Developmental Biology of the Sea Urchin Embryo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GRYNVLi1gxgC&amp;pg=PA171 |year=2012 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-323-14878-8 |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==

===Expression of parental traits===
[[File:Exotic Pheasant (400938368).jpg|thumb|Hybrid between Lady Amherst's pheasant (''[[Chrysolophus amherstiae]]'') and another species, probably golden pheasant (''[[Chrysolophus pictus]]'')]]

When two distinct types of organisms breed with each other, the resulting hybrids typically have intermediate traits (e.g., one plant parent has red flowers, the other has white, and the hybrid, pink flowers).&lt;ref name=M2006&gt;{{cite book |author=McCarthy, Eugene M. |year=2006 |title=Handbook of Avian Hybrids of the World |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, hybrids also combine traits seen only separately in one parent or the other (e.g., a [[bird hybrid]] might combine the yellow head of one parent with the orange belly of the other).&lt;ref name=M2006/&gt;

{{anchor|Interspecific hybrid}}

===Mechanisms of reproductive isolation===
{{main|Reproductive isolation}}

Interspecific hybrids are bred by mating individuals from two species, normally from within the same genus. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents, but are often [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]], preventing gene flow between the species.&lt;ref&gt;Keeton, William T. 1980. ''Biological science''. New York: Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-95021-2}}, p. 800&lt;/ref&gt; Sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes between the two species. For example, [[donkey]]s have 62 [[chromosomes]], [[horse]]s have 64 chromosomes, and [[mule]]s or [[hinny|hinnies]] have 63 chromosomes. Mules, hinnies, and other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable gametes, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during [[meiosis]], meiosis is disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3378453 |year=1988 |author1=Rong |first1=R. |last2=Chandley |first2=A. C.|last3=Song |first3=J. |last4=McBeath |first4=S. |last5=Tan |first5=P. P. |last6=Bai |first6=Q. |last7=Speed |first7=R. M. |title=A fertile mule and hinny in China |journal=Cytogenetics and Cell Genetics |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=134–9 |doi=10.1159/000132531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of mechanisms limit the success of hybridisation, including the large genetic difference between most species. Barriers include morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before fertilization; others after it.&lt;ref name="T.Baker"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Baker | first1=H. G. | year=1959 | title=Reproductive methods as factors in speciation in flowering plants | journal=Cold Spring Harb Symp quant Biol | volume=24 | pages=177–191 | doi=10.1101/sqb.1959.024.01.019 | pmid=13796002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barton"&gt;{{Citation | doi=10.1038/hdy.1986.135 |author1=Barton N. |author2=Bengtsson B.

Sinauer, Sunderland.&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants, some barriers to hybridisation include blooming period differences, different pollinator vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility and structural differences of the chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Hermsen, J. G. Th.; Ramanna, M. S. |title=Barriers to hybridisation of Solanum bulbocastanumDun. and S.

===Speciation===
[[File:Triticum durum.jpg|thumb|[[Durum]] [[wheat]] is [[tetraploid]], derived from [[wild emmer]] wheat, which is a hybrid of two diploid wild grasses, ''[[Triticum urartu]]'' and a wild goatgrass such as ''Aegilops searsii'' or ''[[Aegilops speltoides|Ae. speltoides]]''.&lt;ref name=Gornicki&gt;{{Cite journal| title=The chloroplast view of the evolution of polyploid wheat |author=Gornicki, Piotr|display-authors=etal |date=2014 |journal=New Phytologist | volume=204 |issue=3 |pages=704–714 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.12931/pdf |doi=10.1111/nph.12931}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main article|Hybrid speciation|Hybrid zone}}

A few animal species are the result of hybridization. The [[Lonicera fly]] is a natural hybrid. The American [[red wolf]] appears to be a hybrid of the [[gray wolf]] and the [[coyote]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Esch|first=Mary |title=Study: Eastern wolves are hybrids with coyotes |url=http://archive.boston.com/news/science/articles/2011/05/31/study_eastern_wolves_are_hybrids_with_coyotes/ |work=Boston.com |agency=Associated Press |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=22 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Conservation genomics in perspective: A holistic approach to understanding Canis evolution in North America |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=155|year=2012 |pages=186–192 |url=http://people.trentu.ca/brentpatterson/index_files/Rutledge%20et%20al%202012%20-%20conservation%20genomics%20in%20perspective.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2012.05.017 |last1=Rutledge |first1=Linda Y. |last2=et. al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An account of the taxonomy of North American wolves from morphological and genetic analyses |year=2012|journal=North American Fauna |volume=77 |pages=1–67 |url=http://www.fwspubs.org/doi/pdf/10.3996/nafa.77.0001 |accessdate=2 July 2013 |doi=10.3996/nafa.77.0001 |last1=Chambers |first1=Steven M. |last2=et. al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumbacher, J., [http://www.fws.gov/home/wolfrecovery/pdf/Final_Review_of_Proposed_rule_regarding_wolves2014.pdf Review of Proposed Rule Regarding Status of the Wolf Under the Endangered Species Act], NCEAS (January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The European [[edible frog]] is a semi-permanent hybrid between [[pool frog]]s and [[marsh frog]]s; its population requires the continued presence of at least one of the parent species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frost, Grant, et. al. |title=The amphibian tree of life |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |issue=297 |date=15 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cave paintings indicate that the [[European bison]] is a natural hybrid of the [[aurochs]] and the [[steppe bison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soubrier |first=Julien|last2=et. al. |date=18 October 2016 |title=Early cave art and ancient DNA record the origin of European bison |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13158 |journal=Nature Communications |volume=7 |doi=10.1038/ncomms13158 |pages=13158 |pmid=27754477 |pmc=5071849}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-cave-art-helped-dig-new-animal-species-180960833/?no-ist |title=Cave Paintings Help Unravel the Mystery of the 'Higgs Bison' |last=Daley |first=Jason |newspaper=Smithsonian |access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plant]] Hybridization is more commonplace compared to animal hybridization. Many [[crop]] species are hybrids, including notably the polyploid [[wheat]]s: some have four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (hexaploid), while other wheat species have (like most [[eukaryotic]] organisms) two sets ([[diploid]]), so hybridization events likely involved the doubling of chromosome sets, causing immediate genetic isolation.&lt;ref name=Hancock&gt;{{cite book |author=Hancock, James F. |date=2004 |title=Plant Evolution and the Origin of Crop Species |publisher=CABI Publishing |isbn=0-85199-685-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybridization may be important in speciation in some plant groups. However, homoploid hybrid speciation (not increasing the number of sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. Experimental studies suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed by the fact that early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new genome can remain stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Rieseberg, Loren H. | title=Hybrid Origins of Plant Species | journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | date=1997 | volume=28 |pages=359–389 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.28.1.359?journalCode=ecolsys.1 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.28.1.359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[hybrid zone]]s are known where the ranges of two species meet, and hybrids are continually produced in great numbers. These hybrid zones are useful as biological model systems for studying the mechanisms of speciation. Recently DNA analysis of a bear shot by a hunter in the [[North West Territories]] confirmed the existence of naturally-occurring and fertile [[grizzly–polar bear hybrid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hybrid bear shot dead in Canada |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4766217.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=13 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid vigour===
[[File:Salvia jurisicii x nutans - Flickr - peganum.jpg|thumb|[[Heterosis|Hybrid vigour]]: ''Salvia jurisicii x nutans'' hybrids (top centre, with flowers) are taller than their parents ''[[Salvia jurisicii]]'' (centre tray) or ''Salvia nutans'' (top left).]]
{{Main article|Heterosis}}

Hybrids are not as might be expected always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called [[heterosis|heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage]]. This is most common with plant hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Evaluating the utility of Arabidopsis thaliana as a model for understanding heterosis in hybrid crops |journal=Euphytica |volume=156 |issue=1–2 |date=July 2007 |doi=10.1007/s10681-007-9362-1 |pages=157–171 | last1 = Stokes | first1 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Transgressive segregation|transgressive phenotype]] is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Transgressive segregation, adaptation and speciation |journal=Heredity |date=July 1999 |first=Loren H. |last=Rieseberg |pmid=10583537 |author2=Margaret A. Archer |author3=Robert K. Wayne |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=363–372 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6886170}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plant breeding|Plant breeders]] use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid [[maize]] (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. [[Hybrid seed]] dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, C.

In a hybrid, any trait that falls outside the range of parental variation (and is thus not simply intermediate between its parents) is considered heterotic. ''Positive heterosis'' produces more robust hybrids, they might be stronger or bigger; while the term ''negative heterosis'' refers to weaker or smaller hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=McCarthy, Eugene M. |date=2006 |title=Handbook of Avian Hybrids of the World |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=17 |isbn=978-0-19-518323-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterosis is common in both animal and plant hybrids. For example, hybrids between a lion and a tigress ("ligers") are much larger than either of the two progenitors, while "tigons" (lioness × tiger) are smaller. Similarly, the hybrids between the common pheasant (''[[Phasianus colchicus]]'') and domestic fowl (''[[Gallus gallus]]'') are larger than either of their parents, as are those produced between the common pheasant and hen golden pheasant (''[[Chrysolophus pictus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Darwin, Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |year=1868 |title=Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication |volume=II |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurs are absent in hybrids of the former type, although present in both parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spicer, J.

==Human influence==

===Anthropogenic hybridization===

Hybridization is greatly influenced by human impact on the environment,&lt;ref name=A2001&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allendorf |first=Fred W. |author2=Leary, R. F. |author3=Spruell, P. |author4=Wenburg, J.

Humans have introduced species worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally for purposes such as [[biological control]], and unintentionally, as with accidental escapes of individuals. Introductions can drastically affect populations, including through hybridization.&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vitousek |first=Peter |display-authors=etal |title=Introduced Species: A Significant Component of Human-cause Global Change |journal=New Zealand Journal of Ecology |year=1997 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
[[File:Aquilegia pubescens-formosa hybrid-swarm flowers close.jpg|thumb|Examples of hybrid flowers from [[hybrid swarm]]s of ''[[Aquilegia pubescens]]'' and ''[[Aquilegia formosa]]'']]

There is a kind of continuum with three semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: hybridization without introgression, hybridization with widespread introgression (backcrossing with one of the parent species), and [[hybrid swarm]]s (highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with the parent species). Depending on where a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within [[wildlife management]] and habitat management. [[Global warming|Global climate change]] is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization.&lt;ref name=A2001/&gt;

Conservationists disagree on when is the proper time to give up on a population that is becoming a hybrid swarm, or to try and save the still existing pure individuals. Once a population becomes a complete mixture, the goal becomes to conserve those hybrids to avoid their loss. Conservationists treat each case on its merits, depending on detecting hybrids within the population. It is nearly impossible to formulate a uniform hybridization policy, because hybridization can occur beneficially when it occurs "naturally", and when hybrid swarms are the only remaining evidence of prior species, they need to be conserved as well.&lt;ref name=A2001/&gt;

===Genetic mixing and extinction===
{{Main article|Genetic pollution}}
{{further|Genetic mixing|Introgression}}

Regionally developed [[ecotype]]s can be threatened with [[extinction]] when new alleles or genes are introduced that alter that ecotype. This is sometimes called genetic mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mooney |first1=H. A. |last2=Cleland |first2=E. E. |year=2001 |title=The evolutionary impact of invasive species |journal=PNAS |volume=98 |issue=10 |pages=5446–5451 |doi=10.1073/pnas.091093398 |pmid=11344292 |pmc=33232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hybridization and introgression, which can happen in natural and hybrid populations, of new genetic material can lead to the replacement of local [[genotypes]] if the hybrids are more [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] and have breeding advantages over the indigenous ecotype or species. These hybridization events can result from the introduction of non-native genotypes by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously isolated species into contact. Genetic mixing can be especially detrimental for rare species in isolated habitats, ultimately affecting the population to such a degree that none of the originally genetically distinct population remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rhymer |first1=J.

===Effect on biodiversity and food security===
[[File:Irrigation1.jpg|thumb|The [[Green Revolution]] of the 20th century relied on hybridization to create [[high-yielding varieties]], along with increased reliance on inputs of [[fertilizer]]s, [[pesticide]]s, and [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farmer |first=B. H. |year=1986 |title= Perspectives on the 'Green Revolution' in South Asia |journal=Modern Asian Studies |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=175–199 |doi=10.1017/s0026749x00013627}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main article|biodiversity|food security}}

In agriculture and [[animal husbandry]], the [[Green Revolution]]'s use of conventional hybridization increased yields by breeding "[[high-yielding varieties]]". The replacement of locally indigenous breeds, compounded with unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding (genetic mixing), has reduced the gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds resulting in the loss of [[genetic diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html "Genetic Pollution: The Great Genetic Scandal"] Devinder Sharma {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518120050/http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html |date=18 May 2009}}; Bulletin 28&lt;/ref&gt; Since the indigenous breeds are often well-adapted to local extremes in climate and have immunity to local pathogens, this can be a significant genetic erosion of the gene pool for future breeding. Therefore, commercial plant geneticists strive to breed "widely adapted" cultivars to counteract this tendency.&lt;ref&gt;Troyer, A. Forrest.

Familiar examples of [[equid hybrid]]s are the mule, a cross between a female horse and a male donkey, and the hinny, a cross between a female donkey and a male horse.

{{further|List of plant hybrids}}

Plant species hybridize more readily than animal species, and the resulting hybrids are fertile more often. Many plant species are the result of hybridization, combined with [[polyploidy]], which duplicates the chromosomes. Chromosome duplication allows orderly meiosis and so viable seed can be produced.&lt;ref name="Goulet2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goulet |first1=Benjamin E. |last2=Roda |first2=Federico |last3=Hopkins |first3=Robin |title=Hybridization in Plants: Old Ideas, New Techniques |journal=Plant Physiology |date=2016 |volume=173 |issue=1 |pages=65–78 |doi=10.1104/pp.16.01340 |url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/173/1/65.full|pmc=5210733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant species that are genetically compatible may not hybridize in nature for various reasons, including geographical isolation, differences in flowering period, or differences in [[pollinator]]s. Species that are brought together by humans in gardens may hybridize naturally, or hybridization can be facilitated by human efforts, such as altered flowering period or artificial pollination. Hybrids are sometimes created by humans to produce improved plants that have some of the characteristics of each of the parent species. Much work is now being done with hybrids between crops and their wild relatives to improve disease-resistance or climate resilience for both agricultural and horticultural crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Warschefsky |first1=E. |last2=Penmetsa |first2=R.

'''''Guglielmotti''''' was a {{sclass-|Brin|submarine}} built for the [[Royal Italian Navy]] (''Regia Marina'') during the 1930s.

==Design and description==
The ''Brin''-class submarines were improved versions of the preceding {{sclass-|Archimede|submarine|4}}. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|1000|t|LT|sp=us}} surfaced and {{convert|1254|t|LT|sp=us}} submerged. The submarines were {{convert|72.47|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|6.68|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.54|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The class was partially [[double hull]]ed.&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Chesneau, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|1500|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|550|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|17.3|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|7.8|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the ''Brin'' class had a range of {{convert|9000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|8|kn}}, submerged, they had a range of {{convert|90|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|4|kn}}.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

The boats were armed with eight internal {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s, four each in the bow and stern. They carried a total of 14 [[torpedo]]es. They were also armed with one [[Škoda 10 cm K10#OTO 100.2F47 History|{{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on|0}}]] [[deck gun]] for combat on the surface. The gun was initially mounted in the rear of the [[conning tower]], but this was re-sited on the forward deck later in the war in the surviving boats and the large conning tower was re-built to a smaller design. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of [[Breda Model 1931 Machine Gun|{{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] machine guns.&lt;ref name=c5/&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Guglielmotti'' was built by [[Cantieri navali Tosi di Taranto|Tosi]] shipyard in [[Taranto]], laid down on 3 December 1936, and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 11 September 1938. She was named after Father [[Alberto Guglielmotti]], a renown Italian theologian, historian and a scholar of the history of the Italian Navy.

Upon her commission, ''Guglielmotti'' was assigned together with {{ship|Italian submarine|Brin||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Archimede|1939|2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Torricelli|1939|2}} and {{ship|Italian submarine|Galvani|1938|2}}, as well as the older {{ship|Italian submarine|Galileo Galilei||2}} and {{ship|Italian submarine|Galileo Ferraris|1934|2}} to the 44th Squadron based at [[Taranto]].  During 1939 ''Galileo Galilei'' and ''Galileo Ferraris'' were moved to a different location and the 44th Squadron was renamed to 41st Squadron.

During June 21-29, 1939 she undertook a training cruise from [[Naples]] to [[Lisbon]], under the command of captain Folco Bonamici. Her task was to investigate conditions at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], and experiment with the transfer to the Atlantic and to optimize navigation time and performance. She started her return trip on July 3, and came back to Naples on 8 July 1939.&lt;ref name ="g0"&gt;Giorgerini, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; In the following months, she underwent extensive training and performed exercises.

In 1940 ''Guglielmotti'' was reassigned to the 81st Squadron (VIII Submarine Group) based at the [[Red Sea]] port of [[Massawa]]. Her commander at the time was captain Carlo Tucci.

Her first war mission was to retrieve the men of {{ship|Italian submarine|Macallé||2}} who ended up stranded on the deserted island of Barr Musa Chebir after their submarine ran aground and was scuttled. ''Guglielmotti'' left Massawa on June 21, 1940 and picked up all 21 men next day at 12:45 and then returned to Massawa.&lt;ref name ="g1"&gt;Giorgerini, pp. 392-394&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m2"&gt;[http://www.marina.difesa.it/storiacultura/storia/almanacco/Pagine/Smg/guglielmotti_2.aspx ''Guglielmotti'' at Marina Militare]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26 1940, she was sent together with destroyers {{ship|Italian destroyer|Caesar Battisti||2}} and {{ship|Italian destroyer|Francesco Nullo|1925|2}} to search for two Greek merchants or a British merchant according to other sources, that had been reported as coming from [[Suez]] and heading south but the ship had never been found.&lt;ref name ="b1"&gt;Bertke, p. 372&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to Massawa on July 31.

During 21-25 August 1940 she performed another mission in the Red Sea without sighting any vessels.

On September 6, 1940 ''Guglielmotti'' while on patrol, searching for the British convoy BN-4 south of the Farasan Islands, at about 15:00 sighted two ships. One was too far away, but the other was close and in a good position for an attack. This was a 30 year old tanker ''Atlas'' (4008 GRT) sailing under the Greek flag from [[Abadan]] to [[Suez]], straggling behind the convoy BN-4. ''Guglielmotti'' closed in to within 700 meters and launched two torpedoes. The tanker was hit by both on starboard side opening a large hole from which the oil started flowing into the sea. The crew abandoned the ship, and rowed towards [[Aden]]. Since the tanker did not appear to be sinking, captain Tucci ordered to launch another torpedo, which missed the ship. The fourth torpedo was then launched which hit the ship and broke her into two.&lt;ref name ="g2"&gt;Giorgerini, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; ''Atlas'' sank in the position {{coord|15|50|N|41|50|E}}.

On September 20, 1940 ''Guglielmotti'' and {{ship|Italian submarine|Archimede|1939|2}} were sent to intercept British convoy BN-5, but they could not locate it.&lt;ref name ="b2"&gt;Bertke, p. 484&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20-21, 1940 ''Guglielmotti'' and 'Galileo Ferraris' were sent to intercept British convoy BN-7 consisting of 31 merchants escorted by light cruiser [[HMNZS Leander|HMNZS ''Leander'']], destroyer {{HMS|Kimberley|F50|6}} and 5 sloops. Despite all the efforts, the submarines could not locate the convoy. 

In January 1941, when it became clear that [[Italian East Africa]] would eventually fall, it was decided to send submarines to [[Bordeaux]] to try to save them from either destruction or capture by the British. All submarines were modified for the journey: their fuel tanks were enlarged, some torpedoes, gun ammunition were removed as well as some non-critical items.

On March 3-4, 1941 ''Guglielmotti'' under command of captain Gino Spagone left Massawa together with ''Archimede'' and headed to Bordeaux, in the occupied part of France. After circumnavigating Africa, and being refueled and restocked by the German tanker ''Northmark'' on her way, she finally arrived at Bordeaux on May 6, 1941.&lt;ref name ="g3"&gt;Giorgerini, p. 412-413&lt;/ref&gt; ''Archimede'' arrived at Bordeaux on 7 May, 1941. Overall, ''Guglielmotti'' traveled {{convert|12,425 |nmi}} in 66 days to conclude another war patrol. Upon her arrival, ''Guglielmotti'' underwent maintenance and repairs which kept her out of operation until September 1941.

On September 22, 1941 she sailed from Bordeaux to return to the Mediterranean. On September 30, 1941 ''Guglielmotti'' traveled through the Strait of Gibraltar, and on October 16, 1941 she arrived in [[Messina]] without any incidents.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt;

From November 1941 through February 1942 she was at the Arsenal of Taranto undergoing maintenance and upgrades.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt; As part of the procedure, her 100/43 mm Mod. 1927 gun was replaced with a more modern [[Škoda 10 cm K10#OTO 100.2F47 History|{{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on|0}}/47&amp;nbsp;caliber]] piece.

After the work was finished, on March 15, 1942, ''Guglielmotti'' under command of captain Federico Tamburini departed from [[Taranto]] to her new base in [[Cagliari]].&lt;ref name=m2/&gt; At 6:33 on March 17 British submarine {{HMS|Unbeaten}} (under command of captain Edward Arthur Woodward), lurking off Capo dell'Armi detected her over the hydrophones and two minutes later sighted ''Guglielmotti'' 2200 yards away. After maneuvering to assume a better firing position, at 6:40 ''HMS Unbeaten'' launched four torpedoes. After a minute and 40 seconds an explosion was heard, and ''Guglielmotti'' sank quickly in the position {{coord|37|42|N|15|58|E}}, about 15 miles south of [[Cape Spartivento]] taking the majority of the crew down with her.&lt;ref name ="g4"&gt;Giorgerini, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m2/&gt;

At 7:20 ''HMS Unbeaten'' surfaced, observed there were a dozen survivors in the water, and approached to pick them up. However, a plane was sighted, and the submarine crash dove to avoid being detected and left the area. In about three hours a torpedo boat ''Francesco Stocco'' arrived, and launched a depth-charge attack at the place of sinking, but the British submarine was already far away. Of the twelve survivors captain Woodward had seen in the water, ''Francesco Stocco'' found and recovered only a corpse. There were no survivors among the 61 men of the crew.

==Etymology==

Jeewanu is derived from [[Sanskrit]] ''jeewa'', meaning "life", and ''anu'', meaning the "smallest part of something", or the "indivisible". In contemporary [[Hindi]], ''jeewanu'' also means unicellular organisms such as bacteria. Bahadur specifically used the term to represent the [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophical tradition]] not only through the use of Sanskrit but also by inferring ideas on the origin of life from the [[Vedas]]. Bahadur, while employing the traditional Hindu philosophy, attempted to incorporate the advances in [[cell biology]] to the concept of [[abiogenesis]].&lt;ref name="Grote 2011" /&gt;

==Synthesis==

[[File:Phospholipids aqueous solution structures.svg|thumb|right|200px|The three main structures phospholipids form in solution; the [[liposome]] (a closed bilayer), the micelle and the bilayer.]]

In 1954&lt;ref name="Bahadur 1954"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Photosynthesis of Amino-Acids from Paraformaldehylde and Potassium Nitrate | journal=Nature | date=12 June 1954 | last=Bahadur | first=Krishna | volume=173 | url=http://issuu.com/knudsenconsultants/docs/bahadur1954?e=3452312/5433167 |doi=10.1038/1731141a0 | pages=1141}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1958 Krishna Bahadur and co-workers published the successful synthesis of [[amino acid]]s from a mixture of [[paraformaldehyde]], colloidal [[molybdenum oxide]] or [[potassium nitrate]] and [[ferric chloride]] under sunlight.&lt;ref name="photo"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bahadur | first=K | last2=Ranganayaki | first2=S | last3=Santamaria | first3=L | title=Photosynthesis of amino-acids from paraformaldehyde involving the fixation of nitrogen in the presence of colloidal molybdenum oxide as catalyst | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v182/n4650/abs/1821668a0.html | journal=Nature | volume=182| issue= 4650| pages=1668 | year=1958 | pmid= | doi=10.1038/1821668a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that this experimental approach was seminal for the assays to produce Jeewanu, which he first reported in 1963 in an obscure Indian journal, ''Vijnana Parishad Anusandhan Patrika''.&lt;ref name="bah1" /&gt; His detailed syntheses were published in Germany in 1964 in a series of articles.&lt;ref name="series 1964" /&gt;

Their initial experiment consisted of a sterilised apparatus in which inorganic nitrogenous compounds (such as [[ammonium phosphate]] and [[ammonium molybdate]]) and organic compounds such as [[citric acid]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;), [[paraformaldehyde]] (OH(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H) and [[formaldehyde]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) for carbon sources were mixed with minerals commonly found in living cells.&lt;ref name="Bahadur 1980" /&gt;&lt;ref name='Gupta 2013'/&gt; Inorganic substances such as colloidal [[ferric chloride]] or [[molybdenum]] compounds supposedly acted as cofactors and catalysts.&lt;ref name="Grote 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="photo"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Srivastava 2016/&gt;

When the apparatus was exposed to [[sunlight]] for several days and constantly shaken, microscopic spherical particles were formed. The interesting features of these particles were that they were enclosed in a semipermeable membrane, like the typical [[cell membrane]]. Like living cells, they were reported to contain amino acids, [[phospholipid]] membrane and [[carbohydrate]]s.&lt;ref name="Bahadur 1980" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bahadur 1973"&gt;{{citation | last=Bahadur | first=Krishna | contribution=Photochemical Formation of Self Sustaining Coacervates | title=4th International Symposium of 'Origin of Life on the Earth' | place=Barcelona, Spain | year=June 1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bahadur 1975"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://issuu.com/knudsenconsultants/docs/bahadur1975?e=3452312/3997879 | title=Photochemical Formation of Self Sustaining Coacervates | last=Bahadur | first=Krishna| journal=Zentral Bakteriol Parasitenkd Infektionskr | volume=130 | issue=6 | pages=211–218 | year=1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they were claimed to have reproductive capability by [[budding]], much like [[unicellular organism]]s, but did not grow on any bacterial culture medium.&lt;ref name="Bahadur 1980" /&gt;  Bahadur reported that the Jeewanu exhibited various catalytic properties and produced their own [[peptides]] by metabolic reactions.&lt;ref name="Bahadur 1980" /&gt; Bahadur's later work on the Jeewanu also detected the presence of [[amino acid]]s in peptide form and [[sugar]]s in the form of [[ribose]], [[deoxyribose]], [[fructose]] and [[glucose]], as well as [[Nucleic acid|nucleic acid bases]] ([[DNA]] and [[RNA]] building blocks) including [[adenine]], [[guanine]], [[cytosine]], [[thymine]] and [[uracil]].&lt;ref name="Bahadur 1980" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bahadur Histochemistry 1981"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Histochemical study of lipid-like material in photochemically formed Jeewanu, the photocell, with formaldehyde partially replaced by other organic sources | journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society | date=1981 | last2=Varma | first2=P.

==Scientific reviews==

Bahadur's publications were ambivalently received, and the overall attention of the scientific community seemed limited since Krishna Bahadur and his co-workers reported that the Jeewanus are alive (a striking statement), the team changed the protocols frequently and documented them somewhat idiosyncratically.&lt;ref name="Grote 2011" /&gt; Bahadur defined "living units" as '''"[...] those which grow, multiply, and are metabolically active in a systematic, harmonious, and synchronized manner".''&lt;ref name="bah2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="series 1964" /&gt; Then, NASA's Exobiology Division tasked two biologists in 1967 to review and evaluate the literature so far published by Krishna Bahadur (not to replicate the experiments) on the synthesis and characteristics of the Jeewanu.&lt;ref name="series 1964" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA 1967"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Linda D. | last=Caren | first2=Cyril | last2=Ponnamperuma | year=1967 | url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670026284.pdf | format=PDF | title=A review of some experiments on the synthesis of 'Jeewanu' | work=NASA Technical Memorandum X-1439 | publisher=Ames Research Center | location=Moffett Field, California }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two NASA biologists did not debate whether these three criteria are an adequate [[Life#Biology|definition of life]], but whether the Jeewanu satisfy these criteria.&lt;ref name="NASA 1967" /&gt; The NASA report concluded that "the evidence presented on these three points is on the whole unconvincing". The report also stated that the postulated existence of these living units has not been proved and "the nature and properties of the Jeewanu remains to be clarified."&lt;ref name="NASA 1967" /&gt;

In the 1980s, the Hungarian chemist [[Tibor Gánti]] discussed the Jeewanu at length in his '[[Chemoton]] theory' —an abstract model of autocatalytic chemical reactions— published first in Hungarian and translated into English in 2003.&lt;ref name="Grote 2011" /&gt; In the context of self-organizing structures, Gánti considered the Jeewanu a promising model system to understand the origin and fundamentals of life, and one that had never received due attention.&lt;ref name="ganti"/&gt; In 2011, a German scientist stated that the Jeewanu story pertains to concepts of life, its beginnings, as well as possible artificially created cells.&lt;ref name="Grote 2011" /&gt;

Experimental duplication work published in 2013 by Gupta and Rai reported that their size varies from 0.5 μ to 3.5 μ in diameter, growth from within, metabolic activities, and "the presence of RNA-like material."&lt;ref name='Gupta 2013'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Histochemical localisation of RNA-like material in photochemically formed self-sustaining, abiogenic supramolecular assemblies 'Jeewanu' | journal=Int.

'''John, Prince of Antioch''' (1431–1457), was the second son of [[Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra]], and [[Isabella of Urgell, Duchess of Coimbra]].

== Life ==
He took part in the [[battle of Alfarrobeira]], where his father's army was defeated by the Portuguese royal army.

He was imprisoned and was to be executed. However, due to the intervention of his aunt [[Isabella of Portugal (1397-1471)|Isabella]], he was sent into exile in [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] together with his brother [[Infante James of Coimbra|James]] and sister [[Infanta Beatrice of Coimbra|Beatrice]]. His aunt Isabella, Duchess of Burgundy, was able to offer protection to her nephews and niece as wife of Duke [[Philip the Good]]. In 1456, John was elected a Knight of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].

In 1456, John married [[Charlotte of Cyprus]] in [[Nicosia]] and was accorded the title [[Prince of Antioch]]. He was poisoned on the orders of his mother-in-law, [[Helena Palaiologina]].

He was buried in Nicosia in a tomb which bears his coat of arms.

==Coat of arms==
[[Image:Arms joao coimbra.svg|150px|left|thumb|Coat of Arms of ''Infante'' John of Coimbra, Prince of Antioch.]]
Following his marriage to Charlotte, John bore a unique coat of arms, combining: (I) the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], (II) his father's Portuguese-English ascentry, (III) the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Kingdom of Armenia]], (IV) the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]]; on top the arms of [[Lusignan]].&lt;ref&gt;Ref-Louda-Europe|passage=231.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keyboard Cat''' is an [[Internet meme]]. It consists of a video from 1984 of a female [[cat]] called "Fatso" wearing a blue shirt and "playing" an upbeat rhythm on an [[electronic keyboard]]. The video was posted to [[YouTube]] under the title "charlie schmidt's cool cats" in June 2007. Schmidt later changed the title to "Charlie Schmidt's Keyboard Cat (THE ORIGINAL)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J---aiyznGQ |title=Charlie Schmidt's Keyboard Cat! - THE ORIGINAL! |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fatso (who died in 1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/may/16/keyboard-cat | title = 'Internet review: Play Him Off, Keyboard Cat' | date = 2009-05-16 | accessdate = 2011-02-03 | publisher = guardian.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian bento"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/20/bento-keyboard-cat-youtube-dies |title=Bento the Keyboard Cat, internet sensation and YouTube star, dies  |last=Haynes |first=Gavin |date=20 March 2018 |work=The Guardian |access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was owned (and manipulated in the video) by Charlie Schmidt of [[Spokane, Washington]], [[United States]]. Later, Brad O'Farrell, who was the syndication manager of the video website [[My Damn Channel]], obtained Schmidt's permission to reuse the footage, appending it to the end of a [[blooper]] video to "play" that person offstage after the mistake or gaffe in a similar manner as getting the hook in the days of [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=7659033&amp;page=1 | title = 'Keyboard Cat' Phenomenon Spreads on Web, TV | first = Jake | last = Coyle | date = 2009-05-22 | accessdate = 2009-08-03 | publisher = [[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appending of Schmidt's video to other blooper and other [[viral video]]s became popular, with such videos usually accompanied with the title ''Play Him Off, Keyboard Cat'' or a variant. "Keyboard Cat" was ranked No. 2 on [[Current TV]]'s list of 50 Greatest Viral Videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://current.com/groups/50-greatest-viral-videos/ |title=50 Greatest Viral Videos |publisher=[[Current TV]] |date=27 October 2009 |accessdate=15 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615075302/http://current.com/groups/50-greatest-viral-videos/ |archive-date=2011-06-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Schmidt became owner of Bento, another cat that resembled Fatso, and which he used to create new Keyboard Cat videos, until Bento's death in March 2018.&lt;ref name="guardian bento"/&gt;
The owner, Charlie Schmidt, has made certain remarks that he may adopt or get a “Keyboard Cat 3.0”.

==Other appearances==
The Keyboard Cat meme has been spoofed several times on television. Keyboard Cat was popularized by [[Stephen Colbert]] on May 18, 2009, during a "toss" with ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cc.com/video-playlists/kw3fj0/the-opposition-with-jordan-klepper-welcome-to-the-opposition-w--jordan-klepper/wjwplu | title = Daily/Colbert - Keyboard Cat | publisher = [[Comedy Central]] | date = 2009-05-18 | accessdate = 2018-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2009 [[MTV Movie Awards]], [[Andy Samberg]]'s opening monologue suggested that award winners whose speech went on too long would be played off by Keyboard Cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.virginmedia.com/movies/awards/mtvmovieawards2009/highlights.php?ssid=10 | title= Highlights of the 2009 MTV Movie Awards | publisher = [[Virgin Media]] | accessdate = 2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kato Kaelin]] also spoofed Keyboard Cat in a segment of [[Tosh.0]] entitled "Keyboard Kato" in the series [[List of Tosh.0 episodes|first episode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comedycentral.com/tosh.0/2009/06/04/how-to-keyboard-kato/ | title = How to: Keyboard Kato | date = 2009-06-04 | accessdate = 2010-06-01 | work = [[Comedy Central]] | first = Chris | last = Lesinski}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A television advertisement for [[Wonderful Pistachios]] features Bento, Charlie Schmidt's current Keyboard Cat, cracking one of the nuts during the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | url  =http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Wonderful-Pistachios-Invites-Canada-To-Get-Snackin-1357282.htm  | title = Wonderful Pistachios Invites Canada To "Get Snackin'" | date = 2010-11-22 | accessdate = 2010-12-01 | publisher = Wonderful Pistachios }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bento died on March 8, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffgzh93MdQM |title=Keyboard Cat, Bento, A Tribute |publisher=Keyboard Cat |date=2018-03-16 |accessdate=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'' episode "Avaturd / CSiCarly", Keyboard Cat is shown to be the music leader of the Na'vi alongside other famous blue characters in a spoof of the James Cameron film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''.

The meme has also appeared in various video games. In the [[Nintendo DS]] game, ''[[Scribblenauts]]'', in which the player can summon numerous objects to assist in solving puzzles, Keyboard Cat appears as one of several possible Internet memes that can be called up in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offworld.com/2009/06/e309-scribblenauts-ds-settles.html |title=E309: Scribblenauts DS settles Kraken vs. God vs. Keyboard Cat debate |publisher=Offworld |first=Brandon |last=Boyer |date=2009-06-04 |accessdate=2009-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611145520/http://www.offworld.com/2009/06/e309-scribblenauts-ds-settles.html |archivedate=2009-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of the popularity of the Keyboard Cat meme with the 2009 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] Convention was considered partially responsible for ''Scribblenauts''' success during the convention.&lt;ref name="success at e3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.crispygamer.com/features/2009-06-11/scribblenauts-how-a-nobody-game-became-the-talk-of-this-years-e3.aspx | title = Scribblenauts: How a Nobody Game Became the Talk of This Year's E3 | publisher = [[Crispy Gamer]] | first = Robert | last = Ashley | date = 2009-06-11 | accessdate=  2009-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in [[Activision Blizzard]]'s announcement for ''[[World of Warcraft: Cataclysm]]'' reveals the game's antagonist, Deathwing, playing a keyboard with the text "Keyboard Cataclysm: Play 'em Off, Deathwing".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} A teaser video from [[Ubisoft]] for its video game ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction|Splinter Cell: Conviction]]'', entitled "Play Him Off, Keyboard [[Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell)|Sam]]" parodies the Keyboard Cat theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/5352211/play-him-off-keyboard-sam | title = Play Him Off, Keyboard Sam | publisher = Kotaku | date = 2009-09-03 | accessdate = 2009-09-03 | first = Michael | last = McWhertor }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Xbox Live Arcade]] remake of ''[[Earthworm Jim (video game)|Earthworm Jim]]'' includes additional content, including one [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] character inspired by Keyboard Cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/64052 | title = Earthworm Jim HD Trailer Reveals Co-op | first = Alice | last = O'Conner | date = 2010-06-01 | accessdate = 2010-06-01 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The animated series, ''[[Transformers: Rescue Bots]]'' "Shake Up" has a reference to Keyboard Cat in Frankie Greene's video, depicted a cat playing a keyboard in a similar manner.

During [[Weezer]]'s 2009 summer tour with [[Blink-182]], Keyboard Cat would play the band off every night at the end of their set.

The Keyboard Cat was featured in a cinema spot promoting the UK's [[EE (telecommunications company)|EE]] telecom network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.ee.co.uk/our-company/newsroom/youtube-sensations-given-4gee-makeover-in-new-cinema-campaign-for-ee |title=EE launches new 2014 Gold Spot ad series based on top YouTube sensations &amp;#124; EE |publisher=Explore.ee.co.uk |date=2014-02-28 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently in the 2014 reboot of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/two-new-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-scenes-emphasize-action-personality-mystery-comic-con-2014/ | title = Two New 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Scenes Emphasize Action, Personality and Mystery [Comic Con 2014] | publisher = [[/Film]] | date=2014-07-26 | accessdate=2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keyboard Cat also appeared and revealed herself to be a fan of the [[Carolina Panthers]] in a [[National Football League]] advertisement that first aired during [[Super Bowl XLIX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vine.co/v/OFBIar2AwA5 | title = Keyboard Cat is a #Panthers Fan! | publisher = [[Carolina Panthers]] Vine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Keyboard Cat appeared on one episode  of ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series, season 6)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' Season 6 Episode 22.

On the homepage of the popular online game ''[[Bin Weevils]]'', one can get a glimpse of a large television screen at the Drive-In Cinema where a "bin pet"-ified Keyboard Cat can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.binweevils.com/ |title = Bin Weevils homepage |publisher = 55 Pixels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other memes==
The Keyboard Cat meme has been integrated into other memes. An [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|8-bit]] version of both the cat and the song have been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2009/06/play_mario_off_keyboard_cat.php | title = Play Mario Off, Keyboard Cat | publisher = [[Game Set Watch]] | date = 2009-06-16 | accessdate = 2009-07-27 | first = Eric | last = Caoili }}&lt;/ref&gt; Online clothing vendor [[Threadless]] sells a "Three Keyboard Cat Moon" T-shirt based on the infamous [[Three Wolf Moon]] design;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://theridiculant.metro.co.uk/2009/07/three-kayboard-cat-moon-and-the-internet-did-rejoice.html | title = Three Keyboard Cat Moon: and the internet did rejoice | publisher = ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]'' | date = 2009-07-22 | accessdate= 2009-07-27 | first = Tom | last = Phillips }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/fashion/articles/2009/07/30/wolf_in_chic_clothing/ | title = Wolf in chic clothing | publisher = Boston Globe | first = Christopher | last = Muther | date = 2009-07-29 | accessdate = 2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the shirt design was one of the most popular that the company has had, and they have had difficulties in meeting the demand for the shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/chi-talk-three-cats-tshirtaug27,0,4474186.column | title = Three Keyboard Cat Moon T-shirt: Threadless can't keep it in stock | first = Steve | last = Johnson | date = 2009-08-27 | accessdate = 2009-08-31 | publisher = Chicago Tribune | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090830060016/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/chi-talk-three-cats-tshirtaug27,0,4474186.column | archive-date = 2009-08-30 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shirt appeared in a television ad for the release of the [[PlayStation 3 Slim]] game console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/60221 | title = PlayStation 3 'It Only Does Everything' Ads Debut | first = Chris | last = Faylor | date = 2009-08-27 | accessdate = 2009-08-31 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]]'s ''[[Attack of the Show]]'' held a "Great American Keyboard Cat Competition" to give viewers a chance to create their own Keyboard Cat-inspired art, with over one hundred pieces submitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/blog/post/697989/The-Great-American-Keyboard-Cat-Art-Show-At-Meltdown-Comics.html | title = The Great American Keyboard Cat Art Show At Meltdown Comics | publisher =[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]] | first = Moye | last = Ishimoto | date = 2009-08-03 | accessdate = 2009-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the top works from this were given to the charity Kitten Rescue to be auctioned off through [[eBay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/32805951/ns/today-today_pets_and_animals/ | title = Kitten Rescue auctions off 'Keyboard Cat' art | publisher = [[MSNBC]] | date = 2009-09-11 | accessdate  =2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MLB AL East Champion [[Tampa Bay Rays]] used a variation known as "Rays Keyboard Kitty" (they also had one called "DJ Kitty") to rouse the crowd during its late season run, using a similar cat in Rays gear in several segments. On [[April Fools' Day|April 1]], 2011, [[YouTube]] released a video showing the "Top 5 Viral Pictures of 1911",{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} including a parody of Keyboard Cat titled "Flugelhorn Feline".

There are also a number of videos in which other music has been substituted in for the original song. For example, at the height of the popularity of the podcast ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]'', a YouTube video was released that showed Keyboard Cat "playing" the Serial theme song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc6QFLhHFkY | title = Keyboard Cat Plays the Serial Podcast Theme Song | date = 2014-12-16 | accessdate = 2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one example, Keyboard Cat was appended to the end of a segment of ''[[Desperate Lives]]'' (1982), a made-for-TV movie starring [[Helen Hunt]] showing the effects of drug use (with Keyboard Cat starting after Hunt's character falls out a window and suffers from overdosing); after the video, the submitter then superimposed Keyboard Cat in the music video for [[Hall &amp; Oates]]' "[[You Make My Dreams]]".&lt;ref name="copyright"/&gt; The music video segment has been jokingly called by some the "greatest music video ever."&lt;ref name="cnet"/&gt; While the video still exists at YouTube, copyright issues with [[Warner Music Group]] have forced YouTube to disable the audio.&lt;ref name="copyright"/&gt; The move has alerted groups concerned about copyrights and the [[remix culture]] to warn about potential limitation of creative expression through such actions.&lt;ref name="copyright"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10287081-36.html | title = YouTube pulls audio from greatest music video ever | publisher = [[CNET]] | first = Caroline | last = McCarthy | date = 2009-07-15 | accessdate=2009-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
On June 21, 2011, Schmidt filed a lawsuit in Seattle Federal Court against Threadless for their 2009 line of Three Keyboard Cat Moon T-shirts, a send up  of the then popular [[Three Wolf Moon]] meme, due to copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/inc-well/Some-Advice-on-Avoiding-Lawsuits--124883614.html#ixzz2SJBex3K2 | title = What the Keyboard Cat Has to Teach About Lawsuits | publisher = NBC Chicago News | date = 2011-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Steve|title=Keyboard Cat owner claws Threadless|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-06-30/entertainment/ct-ent-0701-keyboard-cat-suit-20110630_1_threadless-t-shirt-charles-schmidt|website=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threadless counter-claimed by stating that Schmidt's copyright claim was not approved until September 22, 2010, more than a year after the production of the T-shirts, and that Schmidt had lost his copyright when he asked people to submit videos that paid tribute to Fatso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.internetretailer.com/2011/07/01/dead-cat-meows-threadlesscom-over-t-shirt-design | title = A dead cat meows at Threadless.com over a T-shirt design | publisher = internet Retailer | date = 2011-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2013|May}}, this lawsuit has been settled.&lt;ref name="theverge"/&gt;

In May 2013, Schmidt and Christopher Torres, the creator of [[Nyan Cat]], jointly sued [[5th Cell]] and [[Warner Bros.]] for [[copyright infringement]] and [[trademark infringement]] over the appearance of these characters without permission in the ''[[Scribblenauts]]'' series of video games.

Laura Evangelista Alvarado Cardozo was born on 25 April 1875 as the eldest of four children to Clemente Alvarado (d. 1890) and Margarita Cardozo; her brothers were Octaviano, Panchita and Clemencia.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; She received Confirmation at the age of two in 1877 from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Caracas|Archbishop of Caracas]] José Antonio Ponte. She was [[baptized]] on 13 October 1875 and received it from Father Jose Maria Yepez while her godparents were Manuel González and Dolores Bravo Sofia Cardozo - a cousin of hers.&lt;ref name=FD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://friarydiaries.tumblr.com/post/22530523184/may-7th-blessed-maria-of-of-st-joseph|title=May 7th: Blessed Maria of St. Joseph|date=|publisher=The Friary Diaries|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She commenced her studies in her hometown but was forced to complete it in [[Maracay]] when she moved with her parents and siblings. She commenced her studies at the age of five and completed them in September 1892 at the age of seventeen.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; It was around this time that she felt called to the religious life and confided this to her [[Spiritual direction|spiritual director]] Father Vicente Lopez Aveledo. It was on 8 December 1892 that she made a vow to [[God]] to remain a perpetual virgin in His service.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; At the age of thirteen on 8 December 1888 she received her [[First Communion]] and focused on preparing children for the same sacrament from that point until she was eighteen. In 1893 she Father Aveledo's new order devoted to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Blessed Mother]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=FD/&gt; Around that time in 1893 she made a personal resolution: "I want to be a saint, but a real saint ... my [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]], You and only You are the goal of all my striving".&lt;ref name=FD/&gt;

On 3 November 1893 she began to work in a small hospital and assisted patients that suffered from [[smallpox]]. She also volunteered in other hospitals. From 1897 until 1898 she worked as a volunteer in the hospital of San José. Her father died aged 55 of a brain condition in 1890. An earthquake that struck the nation in October 1900 led to her tending to homeless people and those that the disaster impacted.&lt;ref name=FD/&gt; On 11 February 1901 she had the permission of the Archbishop of Caracas Críspulo Uzcátegui to found an order of religious based on the [[Order of Saint Augustine]] and devoted to the care of the ill.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; With three companions she assumed the new habit and commenced her period of [[novitiate]]; she was made the Superior of her order and held that position until her resignation in 1960. On 22 January 1902 she made her solemn profession of her vows and assumed the new name of "María de San José".

On 28 September 1903 the statutes of her order received approval and received recognition on 17 September 1927 as being an order of diocesan right and was under the name of the Augustinian Hospitaller Sisters; this name changed to its present name at some future point.&lt;ref name=FD/&gt; At her request - on 10 May 1950 - the order was added to the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects]]. The congregation received the papal approval of [[Pope Pius XII]] on 15 November 1952.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

She was diagnosed with [[bronchopneumonia]] on 2 June 1966 which contributed to her decline in health. Her situation improved around [[Easter]] of 1967 though started to decline not long after. Cardozo died of [[thrombosis]] on 2 April 1967 at 12:00pm. Her remains were deemed to be incorrupt after their exhumation on 19 January 1994 at 9:00am; her remains were placed in a new sarcophagus in September 1994.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

==Beatification==
The beatification process commenced on 10 June 1983 once formal approval - or "[[nihil obstat]]" (nothing against) - had been granted to the cause. It resulted in the introduction of a diocesan process on 9 October 1983 tasked with compiling evidence attesting to her potential sainthood while also collating documentation pertaining to her life. The process concluded on 13 June 1986 and received the formal ratification of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] on 13 November 1987. This decree affirmed the diocesan process completed its work according to the current standards and would allow for the so-called "Roman Phase" to begin in which the C.C.S. would commence their own investigation into the cause.

The postulation compiled the [[Positio]] and submitted it to the C.C.S. in 1990 for their evaluation. It led to [[Pope John Paul II]] declaring her to be [[Venerable]] on 7 March 1992 after acknowledging that she had lived a life of [[heroic virtue]].

The miracle needed for her beatification was investigated in its diocese of origin and the process was ratified on 3 April 1992 - it involved the cure of Sister Teresa Silva. John Paul II approved the healing as a credible miracle on 23 December 1993 and beatified her on 7 May 1995.

|The Johnson family lived on a settlement in New Hampshire called [[Charlestown, New Hampshire|No. 4]]. The members of the family who were kidnapped were Captain James Johnson and his wife [[Susannah Willard Johnson|Susannah]], Susannah's 14-year-old sister, Miriam Willard, and James and Susannah's three children, 6-year-old Sylvanus, 4-year-old Susannah, and 2-year-old Mary ("Polly"). Susannah was also pregnant with a fourth child, who would be born during captivity. The family was originally kept in an Abenaki village, but most were sold to the French and moved to [[Montreal]] after a few months, with the exception of Sylvanus, who was adopted by the Abenaki. James was given two months to pay his family's ransom, but he did not return to Montreal in time. Susannah and her two youngest daughters were imprisoned, along with James when he arrived. Susannah gave birth in prison to her second son and fifth child, as well as her second to be born in captivity, but he died soon after birth.

After a year in prison, the three female Johnsons, and Miriam, who was not imprisoned with them, were all sent to England, leaving behind young Susannah in the care of three French women. James was killed in battle before seeing his wife and children again. Sylvanus was ransomed and sent back to his family at age 11, unable to speak any English. Young Susannah was sent back to her family at age 10 when the French surrendered Montreal to the British. Susannah Willard Johnson eventually remarried and wrote a book, ''A Narrative of the Captivity of Mrs. Johnson'', about her family's kidnapping.

In 2004, further investigation by "Dunbar's" granddaughter led to conclusive [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA proof]] that the child in Walters' custody was not the Dunbars' son and that the Walters had been wrongfully convicted, meaning the boy was, in fact, Charles Bruce Anderson.

|Raised by kidnapper, later murdered
|A woman going by the name of Sharon Marshall was murdered in 1990 in her early 20s. It was discovered following her death that her husband, who was much older, actually raised her from an early age. DNA testing determined they were not biological relatives. He gave inconsistent stories regarding how she came to be in his custody. Floyd is the prime suspect in Marshall's death. Her true identity remained a mystery until 2014, when DNA testing confirmed that Sharon Marshall was Suzanne Marie Sevakig. Floyd was married to Sevakig's mother when she was sentenced to 30 days in jail for a minor crime. He was left to care for her four children while she was incarcerated. After she was released, she found that the children and Floyd had disappeared. She found two children in the care of the local social services where he left them, but Suzanne and her younger brother were never found and the boy's fate remains unknown. The mother attempted to file kidnapping charges but the local police declined, telling her that the child's stepfather had parental rights over the children.&lt;ref name=Birkbeck&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birkbeck|first1=Matt|title=Finally|url=http://www.mattbirkbeck.com/blog/finally|website=Matt Birkbeck Official Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Murdered
|Lawson was a young lawyer kidnapped in a case bungled by the FBI. A ransom demand of $300,000 was made, which was paid by the family. The FBI inserted tracking devices in the money bag and on the delivery person, but both were on the same frequency and the FBI tracked the delivery person, leaving the money drop by mistake. After later getting a break in the case, the FBI went to the home of suspect Jerry Bland, who refused entry. While officers were retrieving a search warrant left in the car, the suspect retreated inside and shot himself, taking any information on Lawson's whereabouts to his grave. Neither she nor her remains were ever found. The ransom money was mostly recovered from the suspect's attic and vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9D0CE5D7133CF931A35753C1A967958260 Kidnapped Woman Still Missing As Suspect Is an Apparent Suicide].

|Oliver had first met Mullenberg when he was an aide at her school, and became obsessed with her. He followed her and her father as they moved to two locations in Wisconsin. He eventually moved across the street from the Mullenbergs in Eau Claire. Oliver told Mullenburg that a publisher was interested in a story that she wrote; she agreed to go with him in his car. Mullenberg dozed off in the car, and when she awoke, her feet and hands were bound. After an eight-hour drive to Kansas City, Mullenberg and Oliver boarded a plane to Houston, where she spent the majority of her three-and-a-half-month captivity in a motel room. Mullenberg says that physical, sexual and mental abuse were common. Within weeks, Oliver had convinced Mullenberg that her parents didn't want to get her back and didn't love her. Mullenberg says she became so completely disconnected from reality that she remembered very little from her past. A chance viewing of ''America's Most Wanted'' on television confirmed the manager's suspicions that Oliver was up to something. Immediately after recognizing Oliver's photo on the show, calls were placed to law enforcement and the FBI. Authorities who raced to the hotel knew who Mullenberg was, but after months in captivity, she did not. Only after authorities showed Mullenberg pictures from her past did she come back to reality.

He was sexually assaulted and tortured by his kidnapper, Michael Devlin, eventually promising the man to not run away in exchange for Devlin keeping him alive. Hornbeck was given a large amount of freedom, and told neighbors he was being home-schooled. After four years, Devlin was losing sexual interest in him, and so kidnapped another boy, William "Ben" Ownby, with Hornbeck in the car to keep him quiet. The police investigated Devlin and spoke to Hornbeck, but the teenager gave his name as Shawn Wilcox and claimed to be only staying with Devlin while his father was on a business trip. The next day, the police spoke to Devlin again, telling him they were going to check Devlin's pick-up's tires against tracks found at the scene of Ownby's kidnapping. Devlin then admitted that he had both Hornbeck and Ben in his apartment, alive. When Shawn was asked his name again without Devlin in the room, he told the police he was Shawn Hornbeck.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1223">'''Matthäus Abbrederis''' (1652 – c. 1725) was an Austrian [[organist]] and organ builder.  Born in [[Rankweil]], he was baptized on 17 April 1652.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grove|first=George|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|year=1980|publisher=Macmillan Publishers|location=London|isbn=9781561591749|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his contemporaries in the [[Alpine Rhine|Rhine Valley]], south of [[Lake Constance]], considered him an outstanding master of organ building.  Though influenced by the [[Pipe organ#Renaissance and Baroque periods|Baroque style]] of the 17th century, he was not constrained by the version that flourished in South Germany. Many of his organs still survive, such as the one for the monastery church of [[Pfäfers]], Switzerland, built in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Musch|first=H.|title=Die Orgel von Matthäus Abbrederis 1690/91 in Neu St. Johann|year=1993|publisher=Näfels: Orgelbau M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4228">[[File:Mindball at The Bakken Museum.jpg|thumb|Mindball at [[The Bakken]].]]Mindball is created by the Swedish developer Interactive Productline IP AB. 

The technique is based on [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] methodology and the basic concept is to move a ball with your mind; Mindball. 

Mindball can refer to both the '''Mindball Game''' and '''Mindball Play''', both are developed and distributed by Interactive Productline IP AB.[[File:Mindball at The Bakken Museum.jpg|thumb|Mindball at [[The Bakken]].]]

== History ==
The first classic '''Mindball Game''' was delivered 2003. More than 260 tables are now found, primarily at Science Centers, all over the world. An Early Access version of '''Mindball Play''' was launched on Steam December 1st, 2016. The full version will be launched 2018.

Similar games have been developed featuring [[biofeedback]], a concept similar to [[neurofeedback]] used by Mindball. In 1974, the game [[Biofeedback#Biofeedback in electronic games|Will Ball]] was developed featuring a premise similar to Mindball though only using biofeedback.

==Mindball Game (Table Game)==
The classic Mindball Game is a physical table where the players are sitting opposite to each other wearing wired headbands with sensors that picks up the brain signals. On the table top there is a ball rolling back and forth depending on players level of focus. The player who is most focused and relaxed will have their ball score the opponents goal and win.

==Mindball Play (Video Game)==
The Mindball Play is a video game created for the consumer market. The full version of the game was launched on [[Steam (software)]] July 11th, 2018. 

== '''Gameplay''' ==
Mindball Play is a racing game where players control and compete with their own customized ball.

=== '''Tracks''' ===
There are 15 playable tracks in Mindball Play 1.0. Some tracks focus solely on racing with banked turns and sharp drops, others also contain a number of obstacles like deadly laser beams and puddles of slippery oil.

=== '''Modes of gameplay''' ===
Mindball Play has several different modes of gameplay:

* Single Player 
**Time Trial 
**Custom races
**Campaign mode with challenges
* Multiplayer 
**Online (up to 20 players)
**LAN (up to 20 players)
** Split screen (up to 4 players)

=== '''Controller'''s ===
Mindball Play has several available options for input and can be played with:

* Brain signals via an EEG headband (Muse and BrainLink)
* Keyboard
* Gamepad
* Tobii Eye Tracker

'''The brain sensing headband'''

The brain sensing headband measures the players brain waves with EEG technology. 

The more focused the player is, the more control the have over their ball. 

There are two playable options: 

* Play with the headband alone. The ball will follow it's AI while you are focused.
* Play with the headband and any other input mode. The game will listen to your other control when you are focused.

=== '''Features''' ===

* '''Power-ups'''  Power-ups is an optional feature often used in multiplayer. Power-up items are obtained by driving into a box laid out on the course. The power up is then used by the player at will (unless the player pick up a new power up before the current one is used).
* '''Time trial leaderboards for each track'''
* '''AI-opponents'''  An available option in single player mode is to race the ghost-balls of top players from the time trial leaderboard.
* '''Customization of ball'''   Each player can customize skin and color of their own ball.
* '''Steam Achievements'''   The Early Access version of Mindball Play has 32 available steam achievements to date.

'''Molecular paleontology''' refers to the recovery and analysis of [[DNA]], [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, or [[lipid]]s, and their [[Diagenesis|diagenetic]] products from ancient human, animal, and plant remains.&lt;ref name=Marota /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schweitzer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Higby Schweitzer|first=Mary|title=Molecular paleontology: some current advances and problems|journal=Annales de Paléontologie|date=April 2004|volume=90|issue=2|pages=81–102|doi=10.1016/j.annpal.2004.02.001|url=http://www.em-consulte.com/article/139901|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field of molecular paleontology has yielded important insights into evolutionary events, species' [[diaspora]]s, the discovery and characterization of extinct [[species]]. By applying molecular analytical techniques to DNA in [[fossils]], one can quantify the level of relatedness between any two organisms for which DNA has been recovered.&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=B.|author2=Hofreiter, M.|title=A Paleogenomic Perspective on Evolution and Gene Function: New Insights from Ancient DNA|journal=Science|date=23 January 2014|volume=343|issue=6169|pages=1236573–1236573|doi=10.1126/science.1236573|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/1236573.short|accessdate=8 March 2014|pmid=24458647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advancements in the field of molecular paleontology have allowed scientists to pursue [[evolution]]ary questions on a genetic level rather than relying on [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] variation alone. Using various biotechnological techniques such as [[DNA extraction|DNA isolation]],  [[Polymerase chain reaction|amplification]], and [[sequencing]]&lt;ref name="Molecular Palaeontology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Waggoner|first=Ben|title=Molecular Palaeontology|url=http://faculty.uca.edu/benw/reprints/1627.pdf|publisher=Nature Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; scientists have been able to gain expanded new insights into the divergence and evolutionary history of countless organisms.

The study of molecular paleontology is said to have begun with the discovery by Abelson of 360 million year old amino acids preserved in fossil shells.&lt;ref name="Organic constituents of fossils" /&gt;  However, [[Svante Pääbo]] is often the one considered to be the founder of the field of molecular paleontology.&lt;ref name=Hreha&gt;{{cite web|last=Hreha|first=Sarah|title=2013 Gruber Genetics Prize Press Release|url=http://gruber.yale.edu/genetics/press/2013-gruber-genetics-prize-press-release|publisher=Gruber Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of molecular paleontology has had several major advances since the 1950s and is a continuously growing field. Below is a timeline showing notable contributions that have been made.

===Denisovans===

The [[Denisovan]]s of [[Eurasia]], a hominid species related to Neanderthals and humans, was discovered as a direct result of DNA sequencing of a 41,000-year-old specimen recovered in 2008. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA from a retrieved finger bone showed the specimen to be genetically distinct from both humans and Neanderthals. Two teeth and a toe bone were later found to belong to different individuals with the same population. Analysis suggests that both the Neanderthals and Denisovans were already present throughout Eurasia when modern humans arrived.&lt;ref name="Neanderthal Genome sequenced" /&gt; In November 2015, scientists reported finding a fossil tooth containing DNA from [[Denisovan]]s, and estimated its age at 110,000-years-old.&lt;ref name="NYT-20151116"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=In a Tooth, DNA From Some Very Old Cousins, the Denisovans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/science/in-a-tooth-dna-from-some-very-old-cousins-the-denisovans.html |date=16 November 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=16 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS-20151111"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sawyer |first1=Susanna |last2=Renaud |first2=Gabriel |last3=Viola |first3=Bence |last4=Hublin  |first4=Jean-Jacques |last5=Gansauge |first5=Marie-Theres |last6=Shunkov |first6=Michael V. |last7=Derevianko |first7=Anatoly P. |last8=Prüfer |first8=Kay |last9=Kelso |first9=Janet |last10=Pääbo |first10=Svante |title=Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences from two Denisovan individuals |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/11/11/1519905112 |date=11 November 2015 |journal=[[PNAS]] |doi=10.1073/pnas.1519905112 |accessdate=16 November 2015 |bibcode=2015PNAS..11215696S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mitochondrial DNA analysis====
[[File:Neanderthal DNA extraction.jpg|thumb|alt= A photo of Neanderthal DNA extraction in process | Neanderthal DNA extraction. Working in a clean room, researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, took extensive precautions to avoid contaminating Neanderthal DNA samples - extracted from bones like this one - with DNA from any other source, including modern humans. NHGRI researchers are part of the international team that sequenced the genome of the Neanderthal, Homo neanderthalensis.]]
The mtDNA from the Denisovan finger bone differs from that of modern humans by 385 bases ([[nucleotide]]s) in the mtDNA strand out of approximately 16,500, whereas the difference between modern humans and [[Neanderthal genome|Neanderthals]] is around 202 bases. In contrast, the difference between [[chimpanzee]]s and modern humans is approximately 1,462 mtDNA base pairs.&lt;ref name="Krause Johannes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krause|first=Johannes|author2=Fu, Qiaomei |author3=Good, Jeffrey M. |author4=Viola, Bence |author5=Shunkov, Michael V. |author6=Derevianko, Anatoli P. |author7= Pääbo, Svante |title=The complete mitochondrial DNA genome of an unknown hominin from southern Siberia|journal=Nature|date=24 March 2010|volume=464|issue=7290|pages=894–897|doi=10.1038/nature08976|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7290/full/nature08976.html|accessdate=22 April 2014 |pmid=20336068}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggested a divergence time around one million years ago.

These two individuals from the same cave showed more diversity than seen among sampled Neanderthals from all of Eurasia, and were as different as modern-day humans from different continents.&lt;ref name=Pennisi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pennisi|first=E.|title=More Genomes From Denisova Cave Show Mixing of Early Human Groups|journal=Science|date=16 May 2013|volume=340|issue=6134|pages=799–799|doi=10.1126/science.340.6134.799|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6134/799|accessdate=22 April 2014|pmid=23687020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nuclear genome analysis====
Isolation and sequencing of nuclear DNA has also been accomplished from the Denisova finger bone. This specimen showed an unusual degree of DNA preservation and low level of contamination. They were able to achieve near-complete genomic sequencing, allowing a detailed comparison with Neanderthal and modern humans.  From this analysis, they concluded, in spite of the apparent divergence of their mitochondrial sequence, the Denisova population along with Neanderthal shared a common branch from the lineage leading to modern African humans. The estimated average time of divergence between Denisovan and Neanderthal sequences is 640,000 years ago, and the time between both of these and the sequences of modern Africans is 804,000 years ago. They suggest the divergence of the Denisova mtDNA results either from the persistence of a lineage purged from the other branches of humanity through [[genetic drift]] or else an [[introgression]] from an older hominin lineage.&lt;ref name=Reich /&gt;

===Homo heidelbergensis===

However it was not until 2013 that a specimen with retrievable DNA was found, in a ~400,000 year old femur found in the [[Atapuerca Mountains#Sima de los Huesos .281983-.29|Sima de los Huesos Cave]] in Spain. The femur was found to contain both mtDNA and nuclear DNA. Improvements in DNA extraction and library preparation techniques allowed for mtDNA to be successfully isolated and sequenced, however the nuclear DNA was found to be too degraded in the observed specimen, and was also contaminated with DNA from an ancient cave bear (''[[Ursus deningeri]]'') present in the cave.&lt;ref name=Meyer /&gt;  The mtDNA analysis found a surprising link between the specimen and the Denisovans, and this finding raised many questions. Several scenarios were proposed in a January 2014 paper titled "A mitochondrial genome sequence of a hominin from Sima de los Huesos", elucidating the lack of convergence in the scientific community on how ''Homo heidelbergensis'' is related to other known hominin groups. One plausible scenario that the authors proposed was that the ''H. heidelbergensis'' was an ancestor to both Denisovans and Neanderthals.&lt;ref name=Meyer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Matthias |author2=Fu, Qiaomei |author3=Aximu-Petri, Ayinuer |author4=Glocke, Isabelle |author5=Nickel, Birgit |author6=Arsuaga, Juan-Luis |author7=Martínez, Ignacio |author8=Gracia, Ana |author9=de Castro, José María Bermúdez |author10=Carbonell, Eudald |author11=Pääbo, Svante |title=A mitochondrial genome sequence of a hominin from Sima de los Huesos|journal=Nature|date=4 December 2013|volume=505|issue=7483|pages=403–406|doi=10.1038/nature12788|url=http://email.eva.mpg.de/~paabo/pdf1/Meyer_Mitochondrial_nature_2014.pdf|accessdate=23 April 2014 |pmid=24305051}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Completely sequenced nuclear genomes from both Denisovans and Neanderthals suggest a common ancestor approximately 700,000 years ago, and one leading researcher in the field, Svante Paabo, suggests that perhaps this new hominin group is that early ancestor.&lt;ref name="Hominin DNA baffles experts"/&gt;

==Applications==

=== Discovery and characterization of new species ===
Molecular paleontology techniques applied to fossils have contributed to the discovery and characterization of several new species, including the Denisovans and ''Homo heidelbergensis''. We have been able to better understand the path that humans took as they populated the earth, and what species were present during this [[diaspora]].

===De-extinction===
[[File:Pyrenean Ibex.png|thumb|200px|alt=An artist's color drawing of the Pyrenean ibex|The [[Pyrenean ibex]] was temporarily brought back from extinction in 1984.]]

{{main|de-extinction}}

It is now possible to revive [[Extinction|extinct]] species using molecular paleontology techniques. This was first accomplished via [[cloning]] in 2003 with the [[Pyrenean ibex]], a type of wild goat that became extinct in 2000. Nuclei from the Pyrenean ibex's cells were injected into goat eggs emptied of their own DNA, and implanted into surrogate goat mothers.&lt;ref name=Zimmer&gt;{{cite web|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|title=Bringing Extinct Species Back To Life|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/125-species-revival/zimmer-text|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offspring lived only seven minutes after birth, due to defects in its lungs. Other cloned animals have been observed to have similar lung defects.&lt;ref name="Ibex clone"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Richard|title=Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=Telegraph|date=31 Jan 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many species that have gone extinct as a direct result of human activity. Some examples include the [[dodo]], the [[great auk]], the [[Thylacine|Tasmanian tiger]], the [[Baiji|Chinese river dolphin]], and the [[passenger pigeon]]. An extinct species can be revived by using [[Allele|allelic]] replacement&lt;ref name=Church&gt;{{cite web|last=Church|first=George|title=Multiplex Automated Genomic Engineering (MAGE):  A machine that speeds up evolution is revolutionizing genome design|url=http://wyss.harvard.edu/viewpage/330/|publisher=Wyss Institute|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of a closely related species that is still living. By only having to replace a few [[gene]]s within an organism, instead of having to build the extinct species' genome from scratch, it could be possible to bring back several species in this way, even Neanderthals.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The ethics surrounding the re-introduction of extinct species are very controversial. Critics of bringing extinct species back to life contend that it would divert limited money and resources from protecting the world's current [[biodiversity]] problems.&lt;ref name="Scientific American De-extinction"&gt;{{cite news|last=The Editors|title=Why Efforts to Bring Extinct Species Back from the Dead Miss the Point|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-efforts-bring-extinct-species-back-from-dead-miss-point/|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=Scientific American|date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With current extinction rates approximated to be 100 to 1,000 times the background extinction rate,&lt;ref name="Future of Biodiversity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pimm|first=S.

As the editors of a Scientific American article on de-extinction pose: Should we bring back the woolly mammoth only to let elephants become extinct in the meantime?&lt;ref name="Scientific American De-extinction" /&gt; The main driving factor for the extinction of most species in this era (post 10,000 BC) is the loss of habitat, and temporarily bringing back an extinct species will not recreate the environment they once inhabited.&lt;ref name="Causes of Extinction"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Michael|title=Causes of Extinction|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/150962/|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Earth|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of de-extinction, such as [[George M. Church|George Church]], speak of many potential benefits. Reintroducing an extinct keystone species, such as the [[woolly mammoth]], could help re-balance the ecosystems that once depended on them. Some extinct species could create broad benefits for the environments they once inhabited, if returned. For example, woolly mammoths may be able to slow the melting of the Russian and Arctic tundra in several ways such as eating dead grass so that new grass can grow and take root, and periodically breaking up the snow, subjecting the ground below to the arctic air. These techniques could also be used to reintroduce genetic diversity in a threatened species, or even introduce new genes and traits to allow the animals to compete better in a changing environment.&lt;ref name="George Church Sci Am"&gt;{{cite news|last=Church|first=George|title=De-Extinction Is a Good Idea|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/george-church-de-extinction-is-a-good-idea/|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=Scientific American|date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and technology==
When a new potential specimen is found, scientists normally first analyze for cell and tissue preservation using [[Histology|histological techniques]], and test the conditions for the survivability of DNA. They will then attempt to isolate a DNA sample using the technique described below, and conduct a [[PCR amplification]] of the DNA to increase the amount of DNA available for testing. This amplified DNA is then sequenced. Care is taken to verify that the sequence matches the phylogenetic traits of the organism.&lt;ref name=Marota /&gt;  When an organism dies, a technique called [[amino acid dating]] can be used to age the organism. It inspects the degree of [[racemization]] of [[aspartic acid]], [[leucine]], and [[alanine]] within the tissue. As time passes, the D/L ratio (where "D" and "L" are mirror images of each other) increase from 0 to 1.&lt;ref name=AAGL&gt;{{cite web|title=Method: Principles|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~dsk5/AAGL/method/principles.html|work=Amino Acid Geochronology Laboratory|publisher=Northern Arizona University|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In samples where the D/L ratio of aspartic acid is greater than 0.08, ancient DNA sequences can not be retrieved (as of 1996).&lt;ref name="Paabo 1996 Racemization"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poinar|first=H.

[[Mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) is separate from one's nuclear DNA. It is present in [[organelle]]s called [[mitochondria]] in each [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. Unlike [[nuclear DNA]], which is inherited from both parents and rearranged every generation, an exact copy of mitochondrial DNA gets passed down from mother to her sons and daughters. The benefits of performing DNA analysis with Mitochondrial DNA is that it has a far smaller mutation rate than nuclear DNA, making tracking lineages on the scale of tens of thousands of years much easier. Knowing the base mutation rate for mtDNA,&lt;ref name=Henn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henn|first=B. M.|author2=Gignoux, C. R. |author3=Feldman, M. W. |author4= Mountain, J. L. |title=Characterizing the Time Dependency of Human Mitochondrial DNA Mutation Rate Estimates|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|date=6 October 2008|volume=26|issue=1|pages=217–230|doi=10.1093/molbev/msn244|pmid=18984905}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in humans this rate is also known as the [[Human mitochondrial molecular clock]]) one can determine the amount of time any two lineages have been separated. Another advantage of mtDNA is that thousands of copies of it exist in every cell, whereas only two copies of nuclear DNA exist in each cell.&lt;ref name=NFSTC&gt;{{cite web|title=Mitochondrial DNA|url=http://www.nfstc.org/pdi/Subject09/pdi_s09_m02_01.htm|work=DNA Analyst Training|publisher=NFSTC Science Serving Justice|accessdate=23 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201220124/http://www.nfstc.org/pdi/Subject09/pdi_s09_m02_01.htm|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All [[eukaryote]]s, a group which includes all plants, animals, and fungi, have mtDNA.&lt;ref name=Lang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lang|first=BF|author2=Gray, MW |author3=Burger, G |title=Mitochondrial genome evolution and the origin of eukaryotes.|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|year=1999|volume=33|pages=351–97|pmid=10690412|doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.33.1.351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A disadvantage of mtDNA is that only the maternal line is represented. For example, a child will inherit 1/8 of its DNA from each of its eight great-grandparents, however it will inherit an exact clone of its maternal great-grandmother's mtDNA. This is analogous to a child inheriting only his paternal great-grandfather's last name, and not a mix of all of the eight surnames.

===Isolation===
There are many things to consider when [[Protein purification|isolating]] a substance. First, depending upon what it is and where it is located, there are protocols that must be carried out in order to avoid contamination and further degradation of the sample.&lt;ref name="Molecular Palaeontology" /&gt; Then, handling of the materials is usually done in a physically isolated work area and under specific conditions (i.e. specific Temperature, moisture, etc...) also to avoid contamination and further loss of sample.&lt;ref name="Molecular Palaeontology" /&gt;

Once the material has been obtained, depending on what it is, there are different ways to isolate and purify it. [[Ancient DNA|DNA extraction from fossils]] is one of the more popular practices and there are different steps that can be taken to get the desired sample.&lt;ref name="Molecular Palaeontology" /&gt;  DNA extracted from amber-entombed [[fossils]] can be taken from small samples and mixed with different substances, [[centrifugation|centrifuged]], incubated, and centrifuged again.&lt;ref name="Rapid isolation of DNA from fossil and museum specimens suitable for PCR." /&gt;  On the other hand, DNA extraction from insects can be done by grinding the sample, mixing it with buffer, and undergoing [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purification]] through glass fiber columns.&lt;ref name="DNA Extraction From Orthoptera Museum Specimens"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tagliavia|first=Marcello|author2=Massa, Bruno |author3=Albanese, Ida |author4= La Farina, Mario |title=DNA Extraction From Orthoptera Museum Specimens|journal=Analytical Letters|date=29 March 2011|volume=44|issue=6|pages=1058–1062|doi=10.1080/00032719.2010.506939}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, regardless of how the sample was isolated for these fossils, the DNA isolated must be able to undergo [[Gene duplication#Gene duplication as amplification|amplification]].&lt;ref name="Molecular Palaeontology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rapid isolation of DNA from fossil and museum specimens suitable for PCR."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cano|first=RJ|author2=Poinar, HN|title=Rapid isolation of DNA from fossil and museum specimens suitable for PCR.|journal=BioTechniques|date=Sep 1993|volume=15|issue=3|pages=432–4, 436|pmid=8217155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DNA Extraction From Orthoptera Museum Specimens" /&gt;

===Amplification===
[[File:Polymerase chain reaction.svg|thumb|alt=An infographic showing the replication process of PCR | Polymerase chain reaction]]

The field of molecular paleontology benefited greatly from the invention of the [[Polymerase chain reaction|polymerase chain reaction(PCR)]], which allows one to make billions of copies of a DNA fragment from just a single preserved copy of the DNA. One of the biggest challenges up until this point was the extreme scarcity of recovered DNA because of degradation of the DNA over time.&lt;ref name=Marota /&gt;

===Sequencing===
[[DNA sequencing]] is done to determine the order of nucleotides and genes.&lt;ref name="Molecular Paleontology"&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Blair Hodges |author2=Mary H. Schweitzer |title=Molecular Paleontology|publisher=Encyclopedia of Paleontology|pages=752–754|url=http://www.hedgeslab.org/pubs/116.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many different materials from which DNA can be extracted. In animals, the mitochondrial chromosome can be used for molecular study. [[Chloroplasts]] can be studied in plants as a primary source of sequence data.&lt;ref name="Molecular Paleontology" /&gt;

[[File:An evolutionary tree of mammals.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=An evolutionary tree of mammals |An evolutionary tree of mammals]]
In the end, the sequences generated are used to build [[evolutionary trees]].&lt;ref name="Molecular Paleontology" /&gt;  Methods to match data sets include: [[Maximum entropy probability distribution|maximum probability]], [[neighbor-joining|minimum evolution]] (also known as [[neighbor-joining]]) which searches for the tree with shortest overall length, and the [[maximum parsimony]] method which finds the tree requiring the fewest character-state changes.&lt;ref name="Molecular Paleontology" /&gt;  The groups of species defined within a tree can also be later evaluated by statistical tests, such as the [[bootstrap method]], to see if they are indeed significant.&lt;ref name="Molecular Paleontology" /&gt;

==Limitations and challenges==
Ideal environmental conditions for preserving DNA where the organism was desiccated and uncovered are difficult to come by, as well as maintaining their condition until analysis. Nuclear DNA normally degrades rapidly after death by [[Endogeny|endogenous]] [[Hydrolytic|hydrolytic processes]],&lt;ref name="Paabo 1996 Racemization" /&gt;  by UV radiation,&lt;ref name=Marota /&gt;  and other environmental stressors.

Also, interactions with the organic breakdown products of surrounding soil have been found to help preserve biomolecular materials.&lt;ref name=Tuross&gt;{{cite book|last=Tuross|first=N|title=The biochemistry of ancient DNA in bone|publisher=Experientia|pages=50:530–535}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they have also created the additional challenge of being able to separate the various components in order to be able to conduct the proper analysis on them.&lt;ref name="Ancient proteins in fossil bones"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tuross|first=N|author2=Stathoplos, L|title=Ancient proteins in fossil bones|journal=Methods in Enzymology|date=1993|volume=224|pages=121–129|doi=10.1016/0076-6879(93)24010-r}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these breakdowns have also been found to interfere with the action of some of the enzymes used during PCR.&lt;ref name=Tuross /&gt;

Finally, one of the largest challenge in extracting ancient DNA, particularly in ancient human DNA, is in contamination during PCR. Small amounts of human DNA can contaminate the reagents used for extraction and PCR of ancient DNA. These problems can be overcome by rigorous care in the handling of all solutions as well as the glassware and other tools used in the process. It can also help if only one person performs the extractions, to minimize different types of DNA present.&lt;ref name="Paabo 1996 Racemization" /&gt;

'''Moon trees''' are trees grown from 500 seeds taken into orbit around the Moon by [[Stuart Roosa]] during the [[Apollo 14]] mission in 1971.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; As the [[Command Module Pilot]] on the Apollo 14 mission, and as he had been a [[smoke jumper]], Roosa was contacted by Ed Cliff, who was the [[United States Chief Foresters|Chief of the Forest Service]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/People/Chiefs.aspx| title=Chiefs of the U.S. Forest Service| first1=Gerald| last1=Williams| first2=Carol| last2=Severance| first3=James G.| last3=Lewis| date=2009-06-18| publisher=[[Forest History Society]]| accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the time, and who proposed the idea of taking the seeds along. Seeds  for the experiment were chosen from five different types of trees: [[loblolly pine]],  [[sycamore]], [[liquidambar|sweetgum]], [[redwood]], and [[Douglas fir]].&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/moon_tree.html| title=The "Moon Trees"| first=David R.| last=Williams| publisher=[[NASA]]| work=[[Goddard Space Flight Center]]| date=28 July 2009| accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seeds orbited the moon, but were not landed on it.

== Locations ==
After the flight the seeds were sent to the southern [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] station in [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], [[Mississippi]], and to the western station in [[Placerville, California]], with the intent to [[germination|germinate]] them. Nearly all the seeds germinated successfully, and the Forest Service had some 420 seedlings after a few years. Some of these were planted alongside their earth-bound counterparts, which were specifically set aside as controls. After over forty years there is no discernible difference between the two classes of trees. Most of the "Moon trees" were given away in 1975 and 1976 to many state forestry organizations, in order to be planted as part of the nation's bicentennial celebration. Since the trees were all of southern or western species, not all states received trees. A [[Loblolly Pine]] was planted at the [[White House]], and trees were planted in [[Brazil]], [[Switzerland]], and presented to [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Hirohito]], among others.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;

'''''Paracoccus denitrificans''''', is a [[coccus|coccoid]] [[bacterium]] known for its nitrate reducing properties, its ability to replicate under conditions of [[hypergravity]] and for being a relative of the [[eukaryotic]] [[mitochondrion]] ([[endosymbiotic theory]]).

==Description==
''Paracoccus denitrificans'', is a [[gram-negative]], coccus, non-motile, denitrifying (nitrate-reducing) bacterium. It is typically a rod-shaped bacterium but assumes spherical shapes during the stationary phase.&lt;ref name="HAMAP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expasy.ch/sprot/hamap/PARDP.html |title=HAMAP: Paracoccus denitrificans(strain Pd 1222) complete proteome |work=HAMAP (High-quality Automated and Manual Annotation of microbial Proteomes), ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System) proteomics server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) |publisher=[[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics]] |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like all gram-negative bacteria, it has a double [[cell membrane|membrane]] with a cell wall. Formerly known as ''Micrococcus denitrificans'', it was first isolated in 1910 by [[Martinus Beijerinck]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[microbiologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beijerinck |first=M. W. |last2=Minkman |first2=D. C.

Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davis |first=D. H. |year=1969 |title=Proposal to reject the genus Hydrogenomonas: taxonomic implications |journal=[[International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology|Int J Syst Bacteriol]] |volume=19 |issue= |pages=375–390 |doi=10.1099/00207713-19-4-375 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genome of ''P. denitrificans'' was [[genome sequencing|sequenced]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Archived original web report of genome sequencing of ''Paracoccus denitrificans'' by Oak Ridge National Laboratory's human genome sequencing project of [https://web.archive.org/web/20100527221931/http://genome.ornl.gov/microbial/pden/ 08 Jun 2004] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100527221931/http://genome.ornl.gov/microbial/pden/ 11 Sep 2006].  [http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_organism?org=T00440 Entry for ''P. denitrificans''] in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology and ecological applications==
Metabolically ''Paracoccus denitrificans'' is very flexible and has been recorded in soil in both [[Oxygen|aerobic]] or [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] environments. The microbe also has the ability to live in many different kinds of media and environments and is known to be an [[extremophile]]. The bacteria are able to obtain energy both from organic compounds, such as [[methanol]] and [[methylamine]], and from inorganic compounds, such as [[hydrogen]] and [[sulfur]]. The ability to metabolise compounds of hydrogen and sulfur, such as [[thiosulfate]] has led to the microbe being exploited as a model organism for the study of poorly characterized sulfur compound transformations.&lt;ref name="HAMAP"/&gt;

The [[denitrification]] properties of ''Paracoccus denitrificans'' are an important cause for the loss of nitrogen fertilisers in agricultural soil. This is possible due to the chemical process called "denitrification" in which nitrogen is converted to dinitrogen to produce [[nitric oxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]] which cause damage to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="HAMAP"/&gt;

Metabolically, ''Paracoccus denitrificans'' is a known [[chemolithoautotroph]] - several strains of the microbe have been isolated that grow chemolithoautotrophically using [[carbon disulfide]] or [[carbonyl sulfide]] as energy sources. It is not a known human [[pathogen]].&lt;ref name="HAMAP"/&gt;

''Paracoccus'' is a biochemically versatile genus, possessing a variety of metabolisms through which a wide range of diverse compounds can be degraded. Accordingly, it has the potential for a wide variety of capabilities and applications in [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref name="HAMAP"/&gt;

The denitrifying property of ''Paracoccus denitrificans'' has been used in creating a bioreactor, in this case, a tubular gel containing two bacteria, for the removal of nitrogen from wastewater. Paracoccus denitrificans reduces nitrite to nitrogen gas while ''[[Nitrosomonas europaea]]'' oxidizes ammonia to nitrite, thus fueling the former metabolism. This system simplifies the process of removing nitrogen from wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uemoto |first1=H. |last2=Saiki |first2=H. |year=1996 |title=Nitrogen Removal by Tubular Gel Containing Nitrosomonas europaea and Paracoccus denitrificans |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |publisher= |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=4224–4228 |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/62/11/4224?view=long&amp;pmid=8900015|pmid=8900015 |accessdate=28 April 2011 |pmc=168245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain strains of the microbe can utilize [[thiocyanate]] as an energy source, a capability which could help clean thiocyanate-contaminated wastewater from coke-oven factories. Other strains have been discovered that can degrade [[halobenzoate]]s under anaerobic denitrifying conditions, and that can degrade [[sulfonate]]s under anaerobic growth conditions.&lt;ref name="HAMAP"/&gt;

Strains of ''Paracoccus denitrificans'' have been isolated from [[activated sludge]] that degrade a variety of [[methylated amine]]s under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions; another strain is chemolithoautotrophically capable of degrading quaternary carbon compounds such as [[dimethylmalonate]] under denitrifying conditions.&lt;ref name="HAMAP"/&gt;
 
Some strains are capable of 'aerobic denitrification', the complete dissimilation of nitrate to dinitrogen (or nitrous oxide) under aerobic growth conditions. The microbe also can oxidize [[ammonia]] to nitrite while  growth on organic energy sources, a process known as 'heterotrophic nitrification'. Coupled to denitrification, heterotrophic nitrification allows for the complete transformation of ammonia to dinitrogen by a single organism.&lt;ref name="HAMAP"/&gt;

==Resemblance to mitochondria==
Early research indicated that ''Paracoccus denitrificans'' especially resembled [[mitochondria]]. The bacteria encloses within itself the biochemistry of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation. While these features are found randomly distributed in other species of aerobic bacteria, to date all of these are only found in ''Paracoccus denitrificans''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} In addition, a feasible mechanism for the evolution of a eukaryotic mitochondrion, from the plasma membrane of an ancestral aerobic bacterium resembling ''P. denitrificans'' to the inner mitochondrial membrane, has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=John |first=P. |last2=Whatley |first2=F. R. |year=1975 |title=Paracoccus denitrificans and the evolutionary origin of the mitochondrion |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=254 |issue=5500 |pages=495–498 |doi=10.1038/254495a0 |pmid=235742 |bibcode=1975Natur.254..495J }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent phylogenetic analysis however puts other bacteria more closely related to mitochrondria:&lt;ref name=Gabaldon&gt;{{Cite journal| first=T. |last=Gabaldón | title=The proto-mitochondrial metabolism | journal=Science | volume=301 | issue=5633 | year=2003 | pages=690| doi=10.1126/science.1085463 | pmid=12893934|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Proto-mitochondrion]].

==Growth under hypergravity==
Recent research carried out on extremophiles in Japan involved a variety of bacteria including ''Paracoccus denitrificans'' being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an [[ultracentrifuge]] at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 times ''[[Standard gravity|g]]'' (the normal acceleration resulting from gravity at the Earth's surface). ''Paracoccus denitrificans'' displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperaccelaration which are usually found only in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of [[supernova]]s. Analysis showed that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for successful  growth under [[hypergravity]]. The research has implications on the feasibility of the existence of [[exobacteria]] and [[panspermia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/04/110425-gravity-extreme-bacteria-e-coli-alien-life-space-science/ |title=Bacteria Grow Under 400,000 Times Earth's Gravity |author=Than, Ker |date=25 April 2011 |work=National Geographic - Daily News |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deguchi |first1=Shigeru |author2=Hirokazu Shimoshige |author3=Mikiko Tsudome |author4=Sada-atsu Mukai |author5=Robert W.

'''Patricia Teherán Romero''' (10 June 1969 [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]] - 19 January 1995 Loma de Arena)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509123618/http://biografiasvallenatas.bligoo.com.co/patricia-teheran |title=Biografia de Patricia Teheran |date=2016-05-09 |access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Colombian singer and composer, considered the most important female vocalist in the history of [[vallenato]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=El abc del vallenato |last=Julio |first=Oñate Martinez |publisher=Taurus |year=2003 |pages=474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-302935 |title=MURIÓ DIOSA DEL VALLENATO |last=Tiempo |first=Casa Editorial El |website=El Tiempo |language=es-CO |access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kienyke.com/kien-fue/patricia-teheran/ |title=Patricia Teherán |website=KienyKe |language=es-ES |access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53054582 |title=Un secreto prodigioso : crónicas y reportajes a nueve grandes creadores colombianos |last=Faneth. |first=Serrano Ledesma, |date=2003 |publisher=Barú Editores |isbn=9583345881 |location=Bogotá, Colombia |oclc=53054582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1988, she was discovered by [[Graciela Ceballos]], who invited her to be part of a new musical project consisting only of women, which became known as Las Musas del Vallenato,&lt;ref&gt;https://lasmusasdelvallenato.es.tl/25-A%F1os-de-HISTORIA-MUSICAL-.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128114636/http://www.patriciateheran.com/biografia.htm |title=biografia |date=2012-11-28 |access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom she recorded three LPs. The latest work, called ''Explosivas y Sexys'', marked the end of her collaboration with Las Musas and the beginning of a new project called Las Diosas del Vallenato.&lt;ref name="vega"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/76146895 |title=Vallenato : cultura y sentimiento |last=1959- |first=Vega Seña, Marcos Fidel, |date=2005 |publisher=Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia |isbn=9588205697 |location=Bogotá |oclc=76146895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patricia Teherán composed her first song titled "Dueño de mi pasión" for the album ''Con aroma de mujer.''

== Death ==
The artist was driving her car from Barranquilla to Cartagena after signing the participation of the Goddesses of Vallenato in the Carnival of Barranquilla, when at 4:30 in the afternoon, at Loma de Arena one of the tires exploded and the vehicle moving at high speed lost control, resulting in the vehicle overturning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.co/farandula/gente-y-tv/el-confidente-de-patricia-teheran-cuenta-los-ultimos-momentos-de-la-artista |title=El confidente de Patricia Teherán cuenta los últimos momentos de la artista |date=2015-01-19 |work=El Universal Cartagena |access-date=2018-08-02 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7967">'''PowerLab''' (before 1998 was referred to as MacLab) is a [[data acquisition]] system developed by [[ADInstruments]] comprising hardware and software and designed for use in life science research&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=adinstruments&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=0 Papers on Google Scholar] Reference to ADInstruments &amp; PowerLab&lt;/ref&gt; and teaching applications. It is commonly used in physiology, pharmacology, biomedical engineering, sports/exercise studies and psychophysiology laboratories to record and analyse physiological signals from human or animal subjects or from isolated organs. The system consists of an input device connected to a [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[Mac OS]] computer using a [[USB]] cable and LabChart software which is supplied with the PowerLab and provides the recording, display and analysis functions. The use of PowerLab and supplementary [[ADInstruments]] products have been demonstrated on the Journal of Visualised Experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jove.com/search.php?q=adinstruments JOVE: Journal of Visualised Experiments] using PowerLab&lt;/ref&gt;

The original '''MacLab''' unit was developed in the late 1980s to run with only [[Macintosh]] computers to perform computer-based [[data acquisition]] and analysis. The MacLab product range was renamed "PowerLab" in 1997 to reflect the cross-platform nature of the system.

The PowerLab system is essentially a peripheral device designed to perform various functions needed for [[data acquisition]], [[signal conditioning]] and pre-processing.&lt;ref name="powerlab" &gt;{{cite web  | title = Pushing Hardware to the Limits. | page  =  | work =   | publisher = Apple Inc Online | year = 2003   | url = https://www.apple.com/au/pr/casestudies/2003/09/adinstruments/scientific5.html| accessdate = 2008-12-22 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Versatile display options and analysis functions are complemented by the ability to export data to other software (such as Microsoft Excel).

* External signals detected are converted into analog electrical signal
* Signals are amplified to amplify signals and filtered to remove unwanted frequencies or noise
* Analog signal is multiplexed to an [[analog to digital converter]]
* The digitized signal is transmitted to the computer using USB connection
* Software receives, displays, analyses and records data in real time

==Software for PowerLab==

===LabChart===

Formerly known as Chart. The software functions like a traditional multi-channel [[chart recorder]], [[X–Y plotter|XY plotter]], [[polygraph]] and digital [[voltmeter]]. It is compatible with both Windows and Macintosh operating systems. The software has hardware settings control, performs analysis in real-time and offline without the loss of raw data, procedure automation via editable macros, and multiple block samplings for the recording and settings of different signals within one file.&lt;ref name="macresearch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Showcase: LabChart 6 for Turn-Key Data Acquisition. |page= |work= |publisher=MacResearch |date= |url=http://www.macresearch.org/showcase-labchart-6-turn-key-data-acquisition |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212015955/http://www.macresearch.org/showcase-labchart-6-turn-key-data-acquisition |archivedate=2008-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large specialised add-ons called Modules provide data acquisition and analysis features for specific applications such as ECG, blood pressure, cardiac output, HRV etc. Smaller software plugins provide additional and specialized functionality to LabChart. Extensions perform functions such as file translations into other formats (including PVAN and [[IGOR Pro|Igor Pro]]) and specialist analysis functions (for specific research areas such as spirometry and ventricular pressure). The last version of LabChart6 (version 6.1.3) was released on January 2009.

In April 2009, LabChart 7 was released and incorporates the features of a multi-channel digital oscilloscope that allows recording and averaging of up to sixteen signals in real time. Latest version of LabChart7 is version 7.0.

LabChart 8 is also now available.

===LabTutor===

Software provides a range of hands-on laboratory background for students that includes experimental background &amp; protocols, data acquisition &amp; analysis, and report generation within one interface.&lt;ref name="avreview"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Vazquez, J |title= AV &amp; Software Reviews |journal= The American Biology Teacher|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6958/is_3_70/ai_n28524400/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=173–174 |year=2008 |doi= 10.1662/0002-7685}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inquirybase"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Casotti G. |author2=Rieser-Danner L. |author3=Knabb M.T. |title= Successful implementation of inquiry-based physiology laboratories in undergraduate major and nonmajor courses |journal= Advances in Physiology Education|url=http://advan.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/32/4/286 |volume=32 |pages=286–296 |year=2008 |doi= 10.1152/ADVAN.00100.2007|pmid= 19047505 |issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software and accompanying PowerLab hardware is configured for immediate use with step by step instructions designed to maximize student productivity by applying independent learning techniques to a suite of human and animal physiological experiments.&lt;ref name="avreview" /&gt; Recently, LabAuthor software was released to provide educators the ability to design or edit existing LabTutor experiments and tailor the experiments to suit their practical classes without the need of programming or html skills.

===Scope===

Records and analyzes high frequency signals that are time-locked to a stimulus. The display allows computer screen to act as an [[oscilloscope]] and [[Xy plotter|XY plotter]]

===Limitations===

The PowerLab messaging protocol is not publicly available and there is no public API for traditional programming languages such as C.

'''Preta''' ([[Sanskrit]]: प्रेत), also known as '''hungry ghost''', is the [[Sanskrit]] name for a type of [[supernatural]] being described in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese]] and [[Vietnamese folk religion]] as undergoing [[suffering]] greater than that of humans, particularly an extreme level of hunger and thirst.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_gKyQ66KA_cC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Destination Saigon: Adventures in Vietnam| isbn=9781459603059| last1=Mason| first1=Walter| year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have their origins in [[Indian religions]] and have been adopted into [[East Asian religions]] via the spread of Buddhism. Preta is often translated into English as "[[hungry ghost]]" from the Chinese adaptation. In early sources such as the ''[[Petavatthu]]'', they are much more varied. The descriptions below apply mainly in this narrower context.

Pretas are believed to have been false, corrupted, compulsive, deceitful, jealous or greedy people in a previous life. As a result of their [[karma]], they are afflicted with an insatiable hunger for a particular substance or object. Traditionally, this is something repugnant or humiliating, such as [[cadaver]]s or [[feces]], though in more recent stories, it can be anything, however bizarre.&lt;ref&gt;Garuda Purana 2.7.92-95, 2.22.52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the belief and influence of Hinduism and Buddhism in much of Asia, ''preta'' figure prominently in the cultures of India, Sri Lanka, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Tibet, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.

==Names==
The Sanskrit term ''preta'' means "departed, deceased, a dead person", from ''pra-ita'', literally "gone forth, departed".
In Classical Sanskrit, the term refers to the spirit of any dead person, but especially before the obsequial rites are performed, 
but also more narrowly to a ghost or evil being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/ Monier Williams Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sanskrit term was taken up in Buddhism to describe one of six possible states of rebirth.
The Chinese term ''egui'' (餓鬼), literally "starving ghost", is thus not a literal translation of the Sanskrit term.

==Description==
Pretas are invisible to the human eye, but some believe they can be discerned by humans in certain mental states. They are described as human-like, but with sunken, mummified skin, narrow limbs, enormously distended bellies and long, thin necks. This appearance is a metaphor for their mental situation: they have enormous appetites, signified by their gigantic bellies, but a very limited ability to satisfy those appetites, symbolized by their slender necks. 

Pretas are often depicted in [[Japanese art]] (particularly that from the [[Heian period]]) as [[emaciated]] human beings with bulging stomachs and inhumanly small mouths and throats. They are frequently shown licking up spilled water in temples or accompanied by [[demon]]s representing their personal agony. Otherwise they may be shown as [[hitodama|balls of smoke or fire]]. 

Pretas dwell in the waste and desert places of the earth, and vary in situation according to their past [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]. Some of them can eat a little, but find it very difficult to find food or drink. Others can find food and drink, but find it very difficult to swallow. Others find that the food they eat seems to burst into flames as they swallow it. Others see something edible or drinkable and desire it but it withers or dries up before their eyes. As a result, they are always hungry. 

In addition to hunger, pretas suffer from immoderate heat and cold; they find that even the moon scorches them in the summer, while the sun freezes them in the winter.

The sufferings of the pretas often resemble those of the dwellers in [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell]], and the two types of being are easily confused. The simplest distinction is that beings in hell are confined to their subterranean world, while pretas are free to move about.

==Relations between pretas and humans==
[[File:Bhuta College Square Arnab Dutta 2010.JPG|thumb|left|A preta depicted during [[Kali Puja]].]]

Pretas are generally seen as little more than nuisances to mortals unless their longing is directed toward something vital, such as [[blood]]. However, in some traditions, pretas try to prevent others from satisfying their own desires by means of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], illusions, or disguises. They can also turn invisible or change their faces to frighten mortals.

Generally, however, pretas are seen as beings to be pitied. Thus, in some Buddhist monasteries, monks leave offerings of food, money, or flowers to them before meals.

==Local traditions==
[[File:Gaki-Zoushi.jpg|thumb|300px|In ''Gaki zōshi'' 餓鬼草紙 "Scroll of Hungry Ghosts": a ''Gaki'' condemned to feces-eating watches a child wearing ''[[geta (footwear)|geta]]'' and holding a ''[[chūgi]]'', c. 12th century.]]
In Japan, preta is translated as ''gaki'' ({{lang-ja|餓鬼}}, "hungry ghost"), a borrowing from [[Middle Chinese]] ''nga&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt; kjwɨj&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;'' ({{zh|c=餓鬼}}, "hungry ghost"). 

Since 657, some Japanese Buddhists have observed a special day in mid-August to remember the ''gaki''. Through such offerings and remembrances (''[[segaki]]''), it is believed that the hungry ghosts may be released from their torment.

In the modern [[Japanese language]], the word ''gaki'' is often used to mean spoiled child, or brat.  In a game of [[tag (game)|tag]], the person who is "it" may be known as the ''gaki''.

In [[Hinduism]] Pretas are very real beings. They are a form, a body consisting only of air and [[Akasha]] (Sky or Dark matter or space), two of the five elements which constitutes a body on Earth or any other planet - i.e. Air, Water, Dark Matter (Space), Fire and Earth. There are other forms as per the ‘Karma’ or ‘actions’ of previous lives where a soul takes birth in bodies resembling human forms or forms of the main intelligent entity in a planet,  but with a unique difference that is absent of one to three elements. In Hinduism an [[Atma (Hinduism)|Atma]] or Soul is bound to take rebirth after death in a body composed of five or more elements. A soul in transient mode is pure and its existence is comparable to that of a Deva (divine being) but in the last form of physical birth. The elements except Akasha or Sky or Dark matter as defined is the common constituent throughout the Universe and the remaining four are common to the properties of the planets or stars or places of birth. This is the reason that Pretas cannot eat or drink as the rest of the three elements (Earth, Fire, and Water) are missing hence no digestion or physical intake is possible for them. {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion|date=January 2012}}

In Thailand, ''pret'' ({{lang-th|[[:wikt:เปรต|เปรต]]}}) are [[Ghosts in Thai culture|hungry ghost]]s of the Buddhist tradition that have become part of the [[Thai folklore]], but are described as being abnormally tall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://board.postjung.com/topic.php?id=526183&amp;page=1 Thai Ghosts (in Thai)]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Culture of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan culture]], like in other Asian cultures, people are reborn as ''preta'' (''peréthaya'') if they desired too much in their life where their large stomachs can never be fulfilled because they have a small mouth.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.straight.com/life/383891/failed-desires-conjure-shyam-selvadurais-hungry-ghosts&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process philosophy''' — also '''ontology of becoming''', '''processism''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Process Metaphysics: An Introduction to Process Philosophy'', SUNY Press, 1996, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''philosophy of organism'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy Emmet]], 1932, ''Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism'', London: Macmillan; 2nd edn, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; — identifies [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[reality]] with [[Change (philosophy)|change]]. In opposition to the classical model of change as illusory (as argued by Parmenides) or accidental (as argued by Aristotle), process philosophy regards change as the cornerstone of reality—the cornerstone of [[being]] thought of as [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]].

Since the time of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], philosophers have posited true reality as "timeless", based on permanent [[Substance theory|substance]]s, while processes are denied or subordinated to timeless substances. If [[Socrates]] changes, becoming sick, Socrates is still the same (the substance of Socrates being the same), and change (his sickness) only glides over his substance: change is accidental, whereas the substance is essential. Therefore, classic [[ontology]] denies any full reality to change, which is conceived as only accidental and not essential. This classical ontology is what made knowledge and a [[theory of knowledge]] possible, as it was thought that a science of something in becoming was an impossible feat to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fagot-Largeau, [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm 7 December 2006 course] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206183341/http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm |date=6 February 2009 }} at the [[Collège of France]], first part of a series of courses on the "Ontology of Becoming" {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers who appeal to process rather than substance include [[Heraclitus]], [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24196-marx-and-whitehead-process-dialectics-and-the-critique-of-capitalism/ Marx and Whitehead: Process, Dialectics, and the Critique of Capitalism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]],  [[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[Alfred Korzybski]], [[R. G. Collingwood]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Robert M. Pirsig]], [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[Arran Gare]], [[Nicholas Rescher]], [[Colin Wilson]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]]. In physics, [[Ilya Prigogine]]&lt;ref&gt;Ilya Prigogine, ''From being to becoming'', W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes between the "physics of being" and the "physics of becoming". Process philosophy covers not just scientific intuitions and experiences, but can be used as a conceptual bridge to facilitate discussions among religion, philosophy, and science.&lt;ref name="Hustwit"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeremy R. Hustwit|title=Process Philosophy: 2.a. In Pursuit of a Holistic Worldview |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/processp/#SH2a|publisher=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

Process philosophy is sometimes classified as closer to [[Continental philosophy]] than [[analytic philosophy]], because it is usually only taught in Continental departments.&lt;ref&gt;William Blattner, [http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/contanalytic.html "Some Thoughts About "Continental" and "Analytic" Philosophy"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources state that process philosophy should be placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic versus Continental methods in contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=process-philosophy |title=Process Philosophy |last=Seibt |first=Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Gaskill, A. J. Nocek, ''The Lure of Whitehead'', University of Minnesota Press, 2014, p. 4: "it is no wonder that Whitehead fell by the wayside. He was too scientific for the "continentals," not scientific enough for the "analytics," and too metaphysical—which is to say [[Critical philosophy|uncritical]]—for them both" and p. 231: "the analytics and Continentals are both inclined toward [[Kantianism|Kantian]] presuppositions in a manner that Latour and Whitehead brazenly renounce."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Original research|date=September 2007}}

=== In ancient Greek thought ===

Heraclitus proclaimed that the basic nature of all things is change.

The quotation from [[Heraclitus]] appears in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' twice; in 401d as:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' Paragraph [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171%3Atext%3DCrat.%3Asection%3D401d Crat. 401 section d line 5].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|τὰ ὄντα ἰέναι τε πάντα καὶ μένειν οὐδέν}}&lt;br/&gt;''Ta onta ienai te panta kai menein ouden''&lt;br/&gt;"All entities move and nothing remains still"&lt;/blockquote&gt;and in 402a&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Crat.+402&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171 Paragraph 402 section a line 8].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|"πάντα χωρεῖ καὶ οὐδὲν μένει" καὶ "δὶς ἐς τὸν αὐτὸν ποταμὸν οὐκ ἂν ἐμβαίης"}}&lt;br/&gt;''Panta chōrei kai ouden menei kai dis es ton auton potamon ouk an embaies''
&lt;br /&gt;"Everything changes and nothing remains still&amp;nbsp;... and&amp;nbsp;... you cannot step twice into the same stream"&lt;ref&gt;This sentence has been translated by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] in Epistulae, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep6.shtml VI, 58, 23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heraclitus considered fire as the most fundamental element.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=William|title=Heraclitus: The Complete Philosophical Fragments|url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/Philosophy/Heraclitus.html|website=Middlebury College|accessdate=3 October 2015|ref=DK B90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following is an interpretation of Heraclitus's concepts into modern terms by Nicholas Rescher.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...reality is not a constellation of things at all, but one of processes.  The fundamental "stuff" of the world is not material substance, but volatile flux, namely "fire", and all things are versions thereof (puros tropai).  Process is fundamental: the river is not an object, but a continuing flow; the sun is not a thing, but an enduring fire.  Everything is a matter of process, of activity, of change (panta rhei)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rescher|first1=Nicholas|title=Process philosophy a survey of basic issues|date=2000|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=[Pittsburgh]|isbn=0822961288|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An early expression of this viewpoint is in [[Heraclitus]]'s fragments. He posits strife, ''ἡ ἔρις'' (strife, conflict), as the underlying basis of all reality defined by change.&lt;ref&gt;Wheelwright, P. (1959). ''Heraclitus'', Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, {{ISBN|0-19-924022-1}}, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; The balance and opposition in strife were the foundations of change and stability in the flux of existence.

===Twentieth century===
In early twentieth century, the [[philosophy of mathematics]] was undertaken to develop mathematics as an airtight, axiomatic system in which every truth could be derived logically from a set of axioms. In the [[foundations of mathematics]], this project is variously understood as [[logicism]] or as part of the [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalist]] program of [[David Hilbert]]. [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to complete, or at least facilitate, this program with their seminal book [[Principia Mathematica]], which purported to build a logically consistent [[set theory]] on which to found mathematics. After this, Whitehead extended his interest to natural science, which he held needed a deeper philosophical basis. He intuited that natural science was struggling to overcome a traditional ontology of timeless material substances that does not suit natural phenomena. According to Whitehead, material is more properly understood as 'process'. In 1929, he produced the most famous work of process philosophy, ''[[Process and Reality]]'',&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; continuing the work begun by [[Hegel]] but describing a more complex and fluid dynamic ontology.

Process thought describes truth as "movement" in and through substance ([[Hegelian]] truth), rather than [[substance theory|substances]] as fixed concepts or "things" ([[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] truth). Since Whitehead, process thought is distinguished from [[Hegel]] in that it describes entities that arise or coalesce in ''becoming'', rather than being simply dialectically determined from prior posited determinates. These entities are referred to as ''complexes of occasions of experience''. It is also distinguished in being not necessarily conflictual or oppositional in operation. Process may be integrative, destructive or both together, allowing for aspects of interdependence, influence, and confluence, and addressing coherence in universal as well as particular developments, i.e., those aspects not befitting Hegel's system. Additionally, instances of determinate occasions of experience, while always ephemeral, are nonetheless seen as important to define the type and continuity of those occasions of experience that flow from or relate to them.

==Whitehead's ''Process and Reality''==
[[Alfred North Whitehead]] began teaching and writing on process and metaphysics when he joined [[Harvard University]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/whitehed/|title= Alfred North Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Science and the Modern World'' (1925), Whitehead noted that the human intuitions and experiences of science, aesthetics, ethics, and religion influence the worldview of a community, but that in the last several centuries science dominates [[Western culture]]. Whitehead sought a holistic, comprehensive [[Cosmology (philosophy)|cosmology]] that provides a systematic descriptive theory of the world which can be used for the diverse human intuitions gained through ethical, aesthetic, religious, and scientific experiences, and not just the scientific.&lt;ref name="Hustwit"/&gt;

Whitehead's influences were not restricted to philosophers or physicists or mathematicians. He was influenced by the French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), whom he credits along with [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] in the preface to ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929). ''Process and Reality'', Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process metaphysics===

For Whitehead, metaphysics is about logical frameworks for the conduct of discussions of the character of the world. It is not directly and immediately about facts of nature, but only indirectly so, in that its task is to explicitly formulate the language and conceptual presuppositions that are used to describe the facts of nature. Whitehead thinks that discovery of previously unknown facts of nature can in principle call for reconstruction of metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929), pp. 13, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process metaphysics elaborated in ''[[Process and Reality]]''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; posits an ontology which is based on the two kinds of existence of [[entity]], that of actual entity and that of abstract entity or [[abstraction]], also called 'object'.&lt;ref&gt;Palter, R.M. (1960). ''Whitehead's Philosophy of Science'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Actual entity''' is a term coined by Whitehead to refer to the entities that really exist in the natural world.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"&gt;Robert Audi. 1995, ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy.'' Cambridge: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge. 851–853.&lt;/ref&gt; For Whitehead, actual entities are spatiotemporally extended events or processes.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; An actual entity is how something is happening, and how its happening is related to other actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; The actually existing world is a multiplicity of actual entities overlapping one another.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

The ultimate abstract principle of actual existence for Whitehead is '''creativity'''. Creativity is a term coined by Whitehead to show a power in the world that allows the presence of an actual entity, a new actual entity, and multiple actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; Creativity is the principle of novelty.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; It is manifest in what can be called 'singular causality'. This term may be contrasted with the term 'nomic causality'. An example of singular causation is that I woke this morning because my alarm clock rang. An example of nomic causation is that alarm clocks generally wake people in the morning. Aristotle recognizes singular causality as [[Four causes#Efficient cause|efficient causality]]. For Whitehead, there are many contributory singular causes for an event. A further contributory singular cause of my being awoken by my alarm clock this morning was that I was lying asleep near it till it rang.

An actual entity is a general philosophical term for an utterly determinate and completely concrete individual particular of the actually existing world or universe of [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#IX: Theta|changeable entities]] considered in terms of singular causality, about which categorical statements can be made. Whitehead's most far-reaching and radical contribution to metaphysics is his invention of a better way of choosing the actual entities. Whitehead chooses a way of defining the actual entities that makes them all alike, ''qua'' actual entities, with a single exception.

For example, for [[Aristotle]], the actual entities were the [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#Summary#Zeta|substance]]s, such as Socrates. Besides Aristotle's ontology of substances, another example of an ontology that posits actual entities is in the [[Monadology|monads]] of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], which are said to be 'windowless'.

====Whitehead's actual entities====

For Whitehead's ontology of processes as defining the world, the actual entities exist as the only fundamental elements of reality.

The actual entities are of two kinds, temporal and atemporal.

With one exception, all actual entities for Whitehead are '''temporal''' and are '''[[wiktionary:actual occasions|occasions of experience]]''' (which are not to be confused with [[consciousness]]). An entity that people commonly think of as a simple concrete [[object (philosophy)|object]], or that Aristotle would think of as a substance, is, in this ontology, considered to be a temporally serial composite of indefinitely many overlapping occasions of experience. A human being is thus composed of indefinitely many occasions of experience.

The one exceptional actual entity is at once both temporal and '''atemporal''': God. He is objectively immortal, as well as being immanent in the world. He is objectified in each temporal actual entity; but He is not an eternal object.

The occasions of experience are of four grades. The first grade comprises processes in a physical vacuum such as the propagation of an electromagnetic wave or gravitational influence across empty space. The occasions of experience of the second grade involve just inanimate matter; "matter" being the composite overlapping of occasions of experience from the previous grade. The occasions of experience of the third grade involve living organisms. Occasions of experience of the fourth grade involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy, which means more or less what are often called the [[qualia]] of subjective experience. So far as we know, experience in the mode of presentational immediacy occurs in only more evolved animals. That some occasions of experience involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy is the one and only reason why Whitehead makes the occasions of experience his actual entities; for the actual entities must be of the ultimately general kind. Consequently, it is inessential that an occasion of experience have an aspect in the mode of presentational immediacy; occasions of the grades one, two, and three, lack that aspect.

There is no [[Mind-body dualism|mind-matter duality]] in this ontology, because "mind" is simply seen as an abstraction from an occasion of experience which has also a material aspect, which is of course simply another abstraction from it; thus the mental aspect and the material aspect are abstractions from one and the same concrete occasion of experience. The brain is part of the body, both being abstractions of a kind known as ''persistent physical objects'', neither being actual entities. Though not recognized by Aristotle, there is biological evidence, written about by [[Galen]],&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, R. E. (1973). ''Galen: On Psychology, Psychopathology, and Function and Diseases of the Nervous System. An Analysis of his Doctrines, Observations, and Experiments'', Karger, Basel, {{ISBN|978-3-8055-1479-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that the human brain is an essential seat of human experience in the mode of presentational immediacy. We may say that the brain has a material and a mental aspect, all three being abstractions from their indefinitely many constitutive occasions of experience, which are actual entities.

=====Time, causality, and process=====

Inherent in each actual entity is its respective dimension of time. Potentially, each Whiteheadean occasion of experience is causally consequential on every other occasion of experience that precedes it in time, and has as its causal consequences every other occasion of experience that follows it in time; thus it has been said that Whitehead's occasions of experience are 'all window', in contrast to Leibniz's 'windowless' monads. In time defined relative to it, each occasion of experience is causally influenced by prior occasions of experiences, and causally influences future occasions of experience. An occasion of experience consists of a process of prehending other occasions of experience, reacting to them. This is the process in process philosophy.

Such process is never deterministic. Consequently, [[free will]] is essential and inherent to the universe.

The causal outcomes obey the usual well-respected rule that the causes precede the effects in time. Some pairs of processes cannot be connected by cause-and-effect relations, and they are said to be [[Spacetime#Basic concepts#Space-like interval|spatially separated]]. This is in perfect agreement with the viewpoint of the Einstein theory of [[special relativity]] and with the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski geometry]] of spacetime.&lt;ref name="Naber"&gt;Naber, G. L. (1992). ''The Geometry of Minkowski Spacetime. An Introduction to the Mathematics of the Special Theory of Relativity'', Springer, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-387-97848-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Whitehead respected these ideas, as may be seen for example in his 1919 book ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1919"&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1919). ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''[[Process and Reality]]''. Time in this view is relative to an inertial reference frame, different reference frames defining different versions of time.

=====Atomicity=====

The actual entities, the occasions of experience, are logically '''atomic''' in the sense that an occasion of experience cannot be cut and separated into two other occasions of experience. This kind of logical atomicity is perfectly compatible with indefinitely many spatio-temporal overlaps of occasions of experience. One can explain this kind of atomicity by saying that an occasion of experience has an internal causal structure that could not be reproduced in each of the two complementary sections into which it might be cut. Nevertheless, an actual entity can completely contain each of indefinitely many other actual entities.

Another aspect of the atomicity of occasions of experience is that they do not change. An actual entity is what it is. An occasion of experience can be described as a process of change, but it is itself unchangeable.

The reader should bear in mind that the atomicity of the actual entities is of a simply logical or philosophical kind, thoroughly different in concept from the natural kind of atomicity that describes the [[atom]]s of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].

=====Topology=====

Whitehead's theory of extension was concerned with the spatio-temporal features of his occasions of experience. Fundamental to both Newtonian and to quantum theoretical mechanics is the concept of velocity. The measurement of a velocity requires a finite spatiotemporal extent. Because it has no finite spatiotemporal extent, a single point of Minkowski space cannot be an occasion of experience, but is an abstraction from an infinite set of overlapping or contained occasions of experience, as explained in ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; Though the occasions of experience are atomic, they are not necessarily separate in extension, spatiotemporally, from one another. Indefinitely many occasions of experience can '''overlap''' in Minkowski space.

Nexus is a term coined by Whitehead to show the network actual entity from universe. In the universe of actual entities spread&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; actual entity. Actual entities are clashing with each other and form other actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; The birth of an actual entity based on an actual entity, actual entities around him referred to as nexus.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt;

An example of a nexus of temporally overlapping occasions of experience is what Whitehead calls an '''enduring physical object''', which corresponds closely with an Aristotelian substance. An enduring physical object has a temporally earliest and a temporally last member. Every member (apart from the earliest) of such a nexus is a causal consequence of the earliest member of the nexus, and every member (apart from the last) of such a nexus is a causal antecedent of the last member of the nexus. There are indefinitely many other causal antecedents and consequences of the enduring physical object, which overlap, but are not members, of the nexus. No member of the nexus is spatially separate from any other member. Within the nexus are indefinitely many continuous streams of overlapping nexūs, each stream including the earliest and the last member of the enduring physical object. Thus an enduring physical object, like an Aristotelian substance, undergoes changes and adventures during the course of its existence.

In some contexts, especially in the [[theory of relativity]] in physics, the word 'event' refers to a single point in Minkowski or in Riemannian space-time. A point event is not a process in the sense of Whitehead's metaphysics. Neither is a countable sequence or array of points. A Whiteheadian process is most importantly characterized by extension in space-time, marked by a continuum of uncountably many points in a Minkowski or a Riemannian space-time. The word 'event', indicating a Whiteheadian actual entity, is not being used in the sense of a point event.

====Whitehead's abstractions====

Whitehead's '''abstractions''' are conceptual entities that are abstracted from or derived from and founded upon his actual entities. Abstractions are themselves not actual entities. They are the only entities that can be real but are not actual entities. This statement is one form of Whitehead's 'ontological principle'.

An abstraction is a conceptual entity that refers to more than one single actual entity. Whitehead's ontology refers to importantly structured collections of actual entities as nexuses of actual entities. Collection of actual entities into a '''nexus''' emphasizes some aspect of those entities, and that emphasis is an abstraction, because it means that some aspects of the actual entities are emphasized or dragged away from their actuality, while other aspects are de-emphasized or left out or left behind.

'Eternal object' is a term coined by Whitehead. It is an abstraction, a possibility, or pure potential. It can be ingredient into some actual entity.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; It is a principle that can give a particular form to an actual entity.&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279952/After_Whitehead_Rescher_on_Process_Metaphysics After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2004 ({{ISBN|3-937202-49-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead admitted indefinitely many eternal objects. An example of an '''eternal object''' is a number, such as the number 'two'. Whitehead held that eternal objects are abstractions of a very high degree of abstraction. Many abstractions, including eternal objects, are potential ingredients of processes.

====Relation between actual entities and abstractions stated in the ontological principle====

For Whitehead, besides its temporal generation by the actual entities which are its contributory causes, a process may be considered as a concrescence of abstract '''ingredient''' eternal objects. God enters into every temporal actual entity.

Whitehead's '''ontological principle''' is that whatever reality pertains to an abstraction is derived from the actual entities upon which it is founded or of which it is comprised.

====Causation and concrescence of a process====
Concrescence is a term coined by Whitehead to show the process of jointly forming an actual entity that was without form, but about to manifest itself into an entity Actual full (''satisfaction'') based on datums or for information on the universe.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; The process of forming an actual entity is the case based on the existing datums. Concretion process can be regarded as ''subjectification process.''&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;John B. Cobb and David Ray Griffin. 1976, ''Process Theology, An Introduction. Philadelphia: The Westminster Press.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Datum is a term coined by Whitehead to show the different variants of information possessed by actual entity. In process philosophy, datum is obtained through the events of concrescence. Every actual entity has a variety of datum.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

==Commentary on Whitehead and on process philosophy==
Whitehead is not an [[idealism|idealist]] in the strict sense.{{which|date=May 2013}} Whitehead's thought may be regarded as related to the idea of [[panpsychism]] (also known as panexperientialism, because of Whitehead's emphasis on experience).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seager|first1=William|title=Whitehead and the Revival (?) of Panpsychism|url=http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~seager/whitehead.htm|website=University of Toronto Scarborough|publisher=University of Toronto at Scarborough|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On God ===
Whitehead's philosophy is very complex, subtle and nuanced and in order to comprehend his thinking regarding what is commonly referred to by many religions as "God", it is recommended that one read from ''Process and Reality Corrected Edition'', wherein regarding "God" the authors elaborate Whitehead's conception.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"He is the unconditioned actuality of conceptual feeling at the base of things; so that by reason of this primordial actuality, there is an order in the relevance of eternal objects to the process of creation (343 of 413) (Location 7624 of 9706 Kindle ed.)  Whitehead continues later with, "The particularities of the actual world presuppose it ; while it merely presupposes the general metaphysical character of creative advance, of which it is the primordial exemplification (344 of 413) (Location 7634 of 9706 Kindle Edition)." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Process philosophy, might be considered according to some theistic forms of religion to give a [[God#Process theology and process philosophy definition of God|God]] a special place in the universe of occasions of experience. Regarding Whitehead's use of the term, "occasions" in reference to, "God" it is explained in ''Process and Reality Corrected Edition'' that &lt;blockquote&gt;"'Actual entities'-also termed 'actual occasions'-are the final real things of which the world is made up. There is no going behind actual entities to find anything [28] more real.  They differ among themselves: God is an actual entity, and so is the most trivial puff of existence in far-off empty space.  But, though there are gradations of importance, and diversities of function, yet in the principles which actuality exemplifies all are on the same level.  The final facts are, all alike, actual entities; and these actual entities are drops of experience, complex and interdependent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It can be also be assumed within some forms of theology that a God encompasses all the other occasions of experience but also transcends them and this might lead to it being argued that Whitehead endorses some form of [[panentheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=John W.|title=Panentheism--The Other God of the Philosophers: From Plato to the Present|date=2006|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids MI|isbn=978-0801049316|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aokfbkOdjuEC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=Whitehead++panentheism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilv8Xpxb7UAhVGOCYKHaBCB-UQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Whitehead%20%20panentheism&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since, it is argued theologically, that "free will" is inherent to the nature of the universe, Whitehead's God is not omnipotent in Whitehead's metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dombrowski|first1=Daniel A.|title=Whitehead's Religious Thought: From Mechanism to Organism, From Force to Persuasion|date=2017|publisher=State Univ of New York Pr|location=Albany|isbn=978-1438464299|pages=33–35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACKRDQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Whitehead%27s+God+is+not+omnipotent&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  God's role is to offer enhanced occasions of experience. God participates in the evolution of the universe by offering possibilities, which may be accepted or rejected. Whitehead's thinking here has given rise to [[process theology]], whose prominent advocates include [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], and [[Hans Jonas]], who was also influenced by the non-theological philosopher Martin Heidegger. However, other process philosophers have questioned Whitehead's theology, seeing it as a regressive Platonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hustwit|first1=J. R.|title=Process Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/processp/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP)|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead enumerated three essential ''natures of God''. The ''primordial'' nature of God consists of all potentialities of existence for actual occasions, which Whitehead dubbed eternal objects. God can offer possibilities by ordering the relevance of eternal objects. The ''consequent'' nature of God prehends everything that happens in reality. As such, God experiences all of reality in a sentient manner. The last nature is the ''superjective''. This is the way in which God's synthesis becomes a sense-datum for other actual entities. In some sense, God is prehended by existing actual entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viney|first1=Donald|title=Process Theism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-theism/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosoph|publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy and applications ==
=== Biology ===
In [[plant morphology]], [[Rolf Sattler]] developed a process morphology (dynamic morphology) that overcomes the structure/process (or structure/function) dualism that is commonly taken for granted in biology. According to process morphology, structures such as leaves of plants do not have processes, they ''are'' processes.&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1990. "Towards a more dynamic plant morphology". ''[[Acta Biotheoretica]]'' 38: 303–315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1992. "Process morphology: structural dynamics in development and evolution". ''[[Canadian Journal of Botany]]'' 70: 708–714.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[evolution]] and in [[Developmental biology|development]], the nature of the changes of biological objects are considered by many authors to be more radical than in physical systems. In biology, changes are not just changes of state in a pre-given space, instead the space and more generally the mathematical structures required to understand object change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montévil|first=Maël|last2=Mossio|first2=Matteo|last3=Pocheville|first3=Arnaud|last4=Longo|first4=Giuseppe|date=2016-10-01|year=|title=Theoretical principles for biology: Variation|url=https://www.academia.edu/27942089/Theoretical_principles_for_biology_Variation|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches|volume=122|issue=1|pages=36–50|doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.005|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|last3=Kauffman|first3=Stuart|date=2012-01-01|year=|title=No Entailing Laws, but Enablement in the Evolution of the Biosphere|url=https://www.academia.edu/11720588/No_entailing_laws_but_enablement_in_the_evolution_of_the_biosphere|journal=Proceedings of the 14th Annual Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation|series=GECCO '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|volume=|pages=1379–1392|doi=10.1145/2330784.2330946|isbn=9781450311786|via=|arxiv=1201.2069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology ===
With its perspective that everything is interconnected, that all life has value, and that non-human entities are also experiencing subjects, process philosophy has played an important role in discourse on ecology and sustainability. The first book to connect process philosophy with environmental ethics was [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]]'s 1971 work, ''Is It Too Late: A Theology of Ecology''.&lt;ref name="Is It Too Late"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |title=Is It Too Late?: A Theology of Ecology |date=1971 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |isbn=978-0028012803 |url=https://www.amazon.com/too-late-theology-ecology/dp/0962680737}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent book (2018) edited by [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]] and Wm. Andrew Schwartz, ''Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization''&lt;ref name="Putting Philosophy to Work"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |last2=Scwhartz |first2=Wm. Andrew |title=Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization |date=2018 |publisher=Process Century Press |location=Minnesota |isbn=978-1940447339 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Putting-Philosophy-Work-Ecological-Civilization/dp/194044733X}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributors explicitly explore the ways in which process philosophy can be put to work to address the most urgent issues facing our world today, by contributing to a transition toward an ecological civilization. That book emerged out of the largest international conference held on the theme of [[ecological civilization]] (''Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization'') which was organized by the Center for Process Studies in June 2015. The conference brought together roughly 2,000 participants from around the world and featured such leaders in the environmental movement as [[Bill McKibben]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], [[Wes Jackson]], and [[Sheri Liao]].&lt;ref name="conferencereport"&gt;Herman Greene, [http://www.ecozoicsocieties.org/musings/2015/re-imagining-civilization-as-ecological-report-on-the-seizing-an-alternative-toward-an-ecological-civilization-conference/ "Re-Imagining Civilization as Ecological: Report on the 'Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization' Conference"], last modified August 24, 2015, ''Center for Ecozoic Societies'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of [[ecological civilization]] is often affiliated with the process philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]--especially in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Zhihe |last2=Huili |first2=He |last3=Meijun |first3=Fan |title=The Ecological Civilization Debate in China: The Role of Ecological Marxism and Constructive Postmodernism—Beyond the Predicament of Legislation |url=https://monthlyreview.org/2014/11/01/the-ecological-civilization-debate-in-china/ |website=Monthly Review |accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], some of Whitehead's ideas re-emerged in combination with [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] as the [[cognitive science of mathematics]] and [[embodied mind]] theses.

Somewhat earlier, exploration of [[mathematical practice]] and [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics]] from the 1950s to 1980s had sought alternatives to [[metamathematics]] in social behaviours around [[mathematics]] itself: for instance, [[Paul Erdős]]'s simultaneous belief in [[Platonism]] and a single "big book" in which all proofs existed, combined with his personal obsessive need or decision to collaborate with the widest possible number of other mathematicians. The process, rather than the outcomes, seemed to drive his explicit behaviour and odd use of language, as if the synthesis of Erdős and collaborators in seeking proofs, creating sense-datum for other mathematicians, was itself the expression of a divine will. Certainly, Erdős behaved as if nothing else in the world mattered, including money or love, as emphasized in his biography ''[[The Man Who Loved Only Numbers]]''.

=== Medicine ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Several fields of science and especially [[medicine]] seem {{vague|date=May 2013}} to make liberal use of ideas in process philosophy, notably the theory of [[pain]] and [[healing]] of the late 20th century. The [[Philosophy of healthcare|philosophy of medicine]] began to deviate somewhat from [[scientific method]] and an emphasis on repeatable results in the very late 20th century by embracing [[Health system|population thinking]], and a more pragmatic approach to issues in [[public health]], [[environmental health]] and especially [[mental health]]. In this latter field, [[R. D. Laing]], [[Thomas Szasz]] and [[Michel Foucault]] were instrumental in moving medicine away from emphasis on "cures" and towards concepts of individuals in balance with their society, both of which are changing, and against which no benchmarks or finished "cures" were very likely to be measurable.

=== Psychology ===
In [[psychology]], the subject of imagination was again explored more extensively since Whitehead, and the question of feasibility or "eternal objects" of thought became central to the impaired [[theory of mind]] explorations that framed postmodern [[cognitive science]]. A biological understanding of the most eternal object, that being the emerging of similar but independent cognitive apparatus, led to an obsession with the process "embodiment", that being, the emergence of these [[cognition]]s. Like Whitehead's God, especially as elaborated in [[J. J. Gibson]]'s [[perceptual psychology]] emphasizing [[affordance]]s, by ordering the relevance of eternal objects (especially the cognitions of other such actors), the world becomes. Or, it becomes simple enough for human beings to begin to make choices, and to prehend what happens as a result. These experiences may be summed in some sense but can only approximately be shared, even among very similar cognitions with identical DNA. An early explorer of this view was [[Alan Turing]] who sought to prove the limits of expressive complexity of human genes in the late 1940s, to put bounds on the complexity of human [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and so assess the feasibility of [[artificial intelligence]] emerging. Since 2000, Process Psychology has progressed as an independent academic and therapeutic discipline: In 2000, [[Michel Weber]] created the Whitehead Psychology Nexus: an open forum dedicated to the cross-examination of Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy and the various facets of the contemporary psychological field.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, John B., Jr. "Process Psychotherapy: Introduction". ''Process Studies'' vol. 29, no. 1 (Spring–Summer 2000): 97–102; cf.

'''''Red Pawn''''' is a [[screenplay]] written by [[Ayn Rand]]. It was the first screenplay that Rand sold. [[Universal Pictures]] purchased it in 1932.&lt;ref name=peikoff&gt;{{Harvnb|Peikoff|1984|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Red Pawn'' features the theme of the evil of dictatorship, specifically of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]].

''Red Pawn'' is a [[spy thriller]] set on Strastnoy Island in an undisclosed location in northern [[USSR|Soviet Russia]] during the 1920s. On the island is a converted monastery used as an institution for [[political prisoner]]s. The screenplay follows Joan Harding, aka Frances Volkontzev, an American woman who infiltrates Strastnoy Island to free her imprisoned husband, Michael Volkontzev.

Joan enters the prison under the pretext of being the new wife of the prison head Commandant Kareyev given to him by the state. A [[love triangle]] develops between the three characters as Joan works to free her husband while fooling the prison staff and Kareyev as to her true intentions.

The rights to the screenplay belong to [[Paramount Pictures]], though the screenplay has never been adapted to film.&lt;ref name=peikoff/&gt;

== Plot ==

Joan Harding arrives by boat at Strastnoy Island and is presented to Commandant Kareyev as his new, state-granted wife. Kareyev greets Joan coldly, believing that she will leave when the next boat comes six months later. Kareyev takes Joan on a tour around the prison island during which she observes the prisoners. Joan's husband, Michael Volkontzev, recognizes her and calls out to her, but she pretends not to recognize him. It is only later in her room that Joan (real name Frances Volkontzeva) reunites with Michael and tells him of her plan to free him. She will sneak him onto the next boat and help him escape the country through the help of an English merchant in the nearby town of [[Nizhnekolymsk|Nijni Kolimsk]]. She asks that Michael trust her and keep his distance so Kareyev and others do not suspect that they know each other.

Months pass and Joan becomes friends with many of the [[political prisoner]]s on the island, and slowly Commandant Kareyev begins to feel affection for her. Michael is torn over how his wife seems to return that affection and begins to doubt his wife's intentions. Joan arranges for Michael to sneak onto the next boat while the guard is given leave by Kareyev at her insistence, but she will not be joining Michael on the boat. He is to go alone while she stays with Kareyev. Joan tells Michael to meet up with the merchant and that in order to avoid suspicion, she would follow in the coming months.

The night of his escape, Michael barges into Kareyev's room and tells the Commandant that he has attempted to escape and reveals that Joan is his wife. Kareyev has his assistant, Comrade Fedossitch, place Michael in detention and tell Joan that she will be taking the ferry the next day to leave Strastnoy Island. Joan confesses her love for Kareyev and begs him to leave his post and escape with her and Michael, so that she and Kareyev can live together. Kareyev considers her offer but refuses, saying that he cannot betray his Party and his comrades. He tells Joan to pack her things to depart alone in the morning.

Fedossitch confronts Kareyev, telling him Joan should be arrested for deceiving them and the Party. Kareyev puts Fedossitch under arrest and then goes to Joan's room and tells her to follow him to the detention tower to free Michael, so all three of them can escape. The three board the ferry and make their way to shore where they commandeer a horse sled from a local farmer. As the trio make their way to shore, it is discovered that Michael, Joan, and Kareyev are no longer on the island and Fedossitch is freed by a fellow officer. Fedossitch finds that the radio is destroyed, so he alerts the shore of the escape using the monastery's bell and light signals.

Kareyev, Michael, and Joan attempt to flee to the merchant's house and are forced to seek shelter in an empty barn. The two men begin fighting over who should be with Joan. They ask her who she loves, but before Joan has the chance to answer they are discovered and arrested. The commanding officer reveals that Joan and the traitorous commandant are to be taken to the [[State Political Directorate]] headquarters in Nijni Kolimsk, mentioning that it is across the street from an English merchant's house. Joan realizes there is still hope if they can escape their cells and go across the street. However, the commander reveals that Michael is to be taken away for immediate execution. The soldier, unable to distinguish the two male captives, asks Joan to identify which man is her husband. Joan points to Kareyev and tells soldiers he is the one; he makes no objections. The screenplay ends as Kareyev is taken away for execution while Joan and Michael are driven to Nijni Kolimsk with the hope of escape and a future together.

==History==
Rand began writing ''Red Pawn'' in 1931.&lt;ref name=t1&gt;{{harvnb|Trammell|2004|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had emigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union five years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to starting ''Red Pawn'', she had worked as a junior screenwriter for [[Cecil&amp;nbsp;B. DeMille]], but by 1931 she was working in the wardrobe department at [[RKO]] Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had been writing her debut novel, ''[[We the Living]]'', but took a break to write the screenplay in hopes of earning enough money to allow her to write full-time. She sold the screenplay and the synopsis to Universal Pictures in 1932 for $1,500, her first professional sale.&lt;ref name=peikoff/&gt; The studio postponed the filming of the screenplay several times, and with Hollywood entering its [[Red Decade]], the anti-Soviet themes of the film made it unattractive to filmmakers.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt; Universal later traded the property to Paramount, which has held onto the rights since, although ''Red Pawn'' has never been filmed.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;

==Significance==
Professor of literature at [[Anderson University (South Carolina)|Anderson College]] Jena Trammell has cited ''Red Pawn'' as a crucial point in Rand's career and in the development of her aesthetic philosophy, [[romantic realism]].&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;

''We the Living'', finally published in 1936, shares some basic plotlines with ''Red Pawn''. Both feature a [[love triangle]] set against the background of the early [[Soviet Union]], with the woman protagonist having an anti-Communist lover and a Communist one, and with the Communist finally compromising or renouncing his ideological allegiance for love of her.

[[File:Kentucky burgoo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kentucky [[burgoo]], which sometimes contains roadkill.]]

'''Roadkill cuisine''' is preparing and eating [[roadkill]], animals hit by vehicles and found along roads.

It is a practice engaged in by a small [[subculture]] in the [[United States]], southern [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], and other Western countries as well as in other parts of the world. It is also a subject of humor and [[urban legend]].

Large animals including [[deer]], [[elk]], [[moose]], and [[bear]] are frequently struck in some parts of the United States, as well as smaller animals such as [[squirrels]], [[opossum]], [[armadillo]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[skunks]], and birds. Fresh kill is preferred and worms are a concern, so the kill is typically well cooked. Advantages of the roadkill diet, apart from its low cost, are that the animals that roadkill scavengers eat are naturally high in vitamins and proteins with lean meat and little saturated fat, and generally free of additives and drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Almost 1.3 million deer are [[deer–vehicle collisions|hit by vehicles]] each year in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.statefarm.com/retirees/news/top-states-for-deer-collisions|title= Top Five States For Deer–Related Collisions Named|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= statefarm.com|publisher= |access-date= June 6, 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the animal is not obviously suffering from disease, the meat is no different from that obtained by hunting. The practice of eating roadkill is legal, and even encouraged in some jurisdictions, while it is tightly controlled or restricted in other areas.  Roadkill eating is considered unglamorous and mocked in [[pop-culture|pop culture]], where it is often associated with [[stereotype]]s of [[rednecks]] and uncouth persons.

==Preparation==

There are several roadkill cookbooks, typically with a tongue-in-cheek treatment but containing sensible advice, not least of which is ensuring that the flat meat is fresh and free of disease, and is adequately cooked to destroy bacteria and other contaminants.

Rat should be avoided because of the risk of [[Weil's disease]].

[[Buck Peterson]] has written a number of recipe books for this food source which he considers highly underrated, including ''Original Road Kill Cookbook'', ''The International Road Kill Cookbook'' and ''The Totaled Roadkill Cookbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Original Road Kill Cookbook | publisher = Ten Speed Press | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-7946-0255-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The International Road Kill Cookbook | publisher = Ten Speed Press | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-89815-567-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Totaled Roadkill Cookbook | publisher = Celestial Arts | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-89087-812-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Roadkill Cooking for Campers'' by [[Charles Irion]] gives advice on [[outdoor cooking]] of roadkill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Thomas K. Squier, a former [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] survival school instructor, argues that wild meat is free of the steroids and additives found in commercial meat, and is an economical source of protein. His book ''The wild and free cookbook'' includes a section devoted to locating, evaluating, preparing and cooking roadkill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Not all sources are serious. According to some, raccoon or opossum are preferable to squirrel, and the taste is improved by aging and marinating the meat in roadside oil and grease before preparing a stew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are various intergrades between an animal which has been squashed flat, and an animal which has been hit glancingly and thrown onto the verge. An example of the latter would be a [[cock pheasant]] which flew up and tried to challenge a passing car and was thrown on the verge with its skull crushed but no other damage.

As a guide to edibility, the mnemonic "How fresh is it? How flat is it?" serves to remind the would-be eater of the two main characteristics to check before preparing roadkill.

§ 17-319. Big game killed by motor vehicle; salvage permit; violation; classification 

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the carcass of a big game animal that has been killed as a result of an accidental collision with a motor vehicle on a maintained road may be possessed and transported by the driver of the vehicle if the driver first obtains a big game salvage permit issued by a peace officer.

===Illinois===
A whitetail deer that is killed/injured due to a collision with a motor vehicle may be legally possessed by an individual if the following criteria are met:

# The driver of a motor vehicle involved in a vehicle-deer collision has priority in possessing said deer. If the driver does not take possession of the deer before leaving the collision scene, any citizen of Illinois may possess and transport the deer.
# There is no limit to the number of deer that may be possessed under these circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dnr.state.il.us/law3/roadkill.htm |title= DEER ACCIDENTALLY KILLED/INJURED BY A MOTOR VEHICLE |publisher= Illinois DNR |accessdate= 2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Road kill deer may only be claimed by persons who are residents of Illinois, are not delinquent in child support payments and do not have their wildlife privileges suspended in any state. Individuals who claim a deer killed in a vehicle collision shall report the possession of the road kill deer to the [[Illinois Department of Natural Resources|Department of Natural Resources]] by submitting a report to the IDNR within 24 hours by using the on-line Road Kill Deer Reporting Form or by telephoning the Department of Natural Resources no later than 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the next business day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dnr.illinois.gov/pdf/deer_road_kill.pdf |title= Salvage/Road Kill Deer Reporting System |publisher= Illinois DNR |accessdate= 2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kentucky===
In Kentucky, the traditional roadkill stew or wild game stew is known as [[Burgoo]], a stew-like soup of squirrel, rabbit, possum, mutton meat (or whatever meat is available) and vegetables, is declining in popularity, perhaps due to declines in traditional hunting. However, it is still widely served in [[Owensboro, Kentucky|Owensboro]], the burgoo capital of the world.  The Moonlite Bar-b-q Inn is a traditional stop for Burgoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Michigan===
For at least the past 30 years, Michigan has allowed individuals who hit a deer to legally possess it. Upon hitting a deer, the driver was required to call local law enforcement, wait for them to come out to the accident scene, and if you wished, they would issue a free "Highway Killed Deer Permit." As of Sept 28, 2014, this process has been streamlined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Victor|first1=Skinner|title=New road kill legislation is signed into law|url=http://www.outdoornews.com/August-2014/New-road-kill-legislation-is-signed-into-law/|website=Outdoor News|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and permission can be obtained via telephone by calling the DNR or local law enforcement.

In a discussion on the issue the Australian philosopher and [[animal rights]] author [[Peter Singer]] said,&lt;blockquote&gt;I am opposed to subjecting animals to unnecessary pain and killing for food. Even so ... when a deer is accidentally hit by a car ... killing the animal to remove the pain is, in my opinion, justified and ethical. If an animal has been killed in an accident or is killed to prevent additional suffering before it dies and if this dead animal is a source of food, why not eat it when it is edible?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On the TV series ''[[You Can't Do That on Television]]'', the chef Barth sometimes served roadkill at his restaurant. Also, on the TV series ''[[I'm With Busey]]'', Actor [[Gary Busey]] attempts to pitch his idea of a roadkill cookbook. Later on, Busey also cooks a dead badger from the side of the road.

The term "Roadkill Cafe" is sometimes considered a joke, with the tagline "You kill it, we grill it" or "From your grill to ours". However, there are several ''real'' Roadkill Cafes in existence, none known to be associated with each other.

His 1971 book ''Journeys Out of the Body'' is credited with popularizing the term "[[out-of-body experience]]".

Monroe achieved worldwide recognition as an explorer of human consciousness and out-of-body experiences. His research, beginning in the 1950s, produced evidence that specific sound patterns have identifiable, beneficial effects on our capabilities. For example, certain combinations of frequencies appeared to enhance alertness; others to induce sleep; and still others to evoke expanded states of consciousness.

Assisted by specialists in psychology, medicine, biochemistry, psychiatry, electrical engineering, physics, and education, Robert Monroe developed [[Hemi-Sync]], a patented audio technology that is claimed to facilitate enhanced performance.&lt;ref name=monroe1&gt;Monroe, Robert A (1977) "Journeys Out of the Body", Anchor Press, {{ISBN|0-385-00861-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=russell1&gt;Russell Ronald (2007) "The Journey of Robert Monroe: From Out-Of-Body Explorer to Consciousness Pioneer", Hampton Roads Publishing, {{ISBN|1-57174-533-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stockton&gt;Stockton Bayard (1989) "Catapult: The Biography of Robert A.

==Biography==
Robert Allan Monroe was born in Indiana, weighing twelve pounds. He grew up in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], and [[Columbus, Ohio]]; his mother, Georgia Helen Jordan Monroe, was a non-practicing medical doctor and [[cello|cellist]] and piano player. His father, Robert Emmett Monroe, was a college professor of [[Romance Languages]] who led summer tours to Europe. Monroe had two older sisters, Dorothy and Peggy, and a younger brother, Emmett, who became a medical doctor.

According to his third book ''Ultimate Journey'',&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Journey'', published 1994 by Doubleday&lt;/ref&gt; he dropped out of [[Ohio State University]] in his sophomore year due to a hospital stay for a facial burn that caused him to fall behind in his studies. During almost a year away from college, a desire to find work led him to become a [[hobo]] who rode freight trains. He returned to Ohio State to graduate after having studied [[pre-med]], English, engineering, and journalism.

He had an early fascination with flying and music and had great mechanical aptitude. He displayed some ability to read music by age four without having studied the subject, perhaps by listening to his mother and sisters playing piano.

He married Jeanette, a graduate student and daughter of a lawyer, in 1937, and divorced her in 1938 or 1939. He married Mary Ashworth, a divorcee with a daughter Maria, in 1950 or 1951. They had Bob's only biological child together, daughter Laurie. They divorced in 1968. He then married Nancy Penn Honeycutt, a divorcee with four children. They remained married until her death from breast cancer on August 15, 1992.

Monroe developed ulcers in young adulthood and so was classified [[Selective Service System|4F]] (unfit for service) during [[World War II]]. He spent the war years working for a manufacturing company that designed a flight-simulator prototype. He wrote for an aviation column in ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' magazine and was given a job with the [[National Aeronautic Association]] (NAA), for whom he produced a weekly radio show called "Scramble!", the primary purpose of which was to interest youth in aviation.

In 1953 Mr. Monroe formed RAM Enterprises, a corporation that produced network radio programs, as many as 28 programs monthly, principally in dramatic and popular quiz shows.

In 1956 the firm created a Research and Development division to study the effects of various sound patterns on human consciousness, including the sleep state. Monroe was especially attracted to the concept of [[sleep-learning]]. This was a natural direction to take, applying to this new area the audio production methods used in the firm's commercial activity. The purpose was to find more constructive uses for such knowledge than was ordinarily available, and the results of this research have become internationally known.

==First out-of-body experiences==

According to his own account, while experimenting with [[sleep-learning]] in 1958 Monroe experienced an unusual phenomenon, which he described as sensations of paralysis and vibration accompanied by a bright light that appeared to be shining on him from a shallow angle. Monroe went on to say that this occurred another nine times over the next six weeks, culminating in his first [[out-of-body experience]] (OBE). Monroe recorded his account in his 1971 book ''Journeys Out of the Body'' and went on to become a prominent researcher in the field of human consciousness.&lt;ref name=monroe1/&gt;&lt;ref name=russell1/&gt;&lt;ref name=stockton/&gt;&lt;ref name=mayer1/&gt; Monroe later authored two more books on his experiments with OBE, ''Far Journeys'' (1985) and ''Ultimate Journey'' (1994).

==The Monroe Institute==

In 1962 the company moved to Virginia, and a few years later changed the corporate name to Monroe Industries. In this location it became active in radio station ownership, cable television, and later in the production and sale of audio cassettes. These cassettes were practical expressions of the discoveries made in the earlier and ongoing corporate research program.

In 1985 the company officially changed its name, once again, to Interstate Industries, Inc. This reflected Monroe's analogy of how the use of Hemi-Sync serves as a ramp from the "local road" to the "interstate" in allowing people to go "full steam ahead" in the exploration of consciousness, avoiding all of the stops and starts.

The research subsidiary was divested and established as an independent non-profit organization, The Monroe Institute, later in 1985. Interstate Industries, Inc. remains a privately held company, now doing business as Monroe Products.

Robert Monroe's leadership of the entire program of development were supported for more than 50 years by many specialists who continue their participation to this day. His daughter, Laurie Monroe, continued her father's research into consciousness and the mind's potential until her death in 2006. Under the current direction of another of Monroe's daughters, Maria Monroe Whitehead, Monroe's stepson, A. J. Honeycutt, and Teresa West, president of Monroe Products, the company's objective is to continue to expand the Hemi-Sync line of products and their benefits into markets worldwide.

'''The Monroe Institute''' ('''TMI''') is a [[non-profit organization|nonprofit]] education and research organization devoted to the exploration of human [[consciousness]], based in [[Faber, Virginia|Faber]], [[Virginia]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monroeinstitute.org The Monroe Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Upwards of 20,000 people are estimated to have attended TMI's residential Gateway program during its first thirty years,&lt;ref&gt;R. Russell, Journey of Robert Monroe: From Out of Body Explorer to Consciousness Pioneer, Deep Books, July 2007, p105. {{ISBN|978-1-57174-533-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; with consumers of the audio industry founded on its research running into millions.&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Filimon, [http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2010/Iasi/AMTA/AMTA-18.pdf Beneficial Subliminal Music: Binaural Beats, Hemi-Sync and Metamusic], Proceedings of the 11th WSEAS international conference on Acoustics &amp; music: theory &amp; applications, 2010, p106&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, many tens of thousands of people have experienced the residential programs developed by the Monroe Institute at TMI's campus in Virginia as well as across the US and the world, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, England, France, Germany, Japan, Romania, and Spain. TMI claims a policy of no dogma or [[bias]] with respect to [[belief system]], [[religion]], [[political]] or [[social]] stance.

TMI was founded by Robert Monroe after he started having what he called "[[Out-of-body experience|out of body experiences]]", now also commonly referred to as OBEs.  It comprises several buildings on {{convert|300|acre|km2}} of land south of [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], USA.  One of its activities includes teaching various techniques, based on audio-guidance processes, in order to expand consciousness and explore areas of consciousness not normally available in the waking state.

In 1978, the U.S. military evaluated TMI and arranged to send officers there for OBE training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remoteviewed.com/files/stargate/14.8.05/1978%20Gondola%20Wish%20Assesment%20report.pdf Gondola Wish Assessment Report], 902d Military Intelligence Group, 25 August 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1983, it sent additional officers.&lt;ref&gt;Remote Viewers: The Secret History of America's Psychic Spies, Jim Schnabel, 1997, p292-3. {{ISBN|978-0-440-61405-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101128143321/http://starpod.org/SPECIAL/STAR_GATE/rapt.htm INSCOM log for August 1983 to January 1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Controlled studies of the Institute's technology suggest that it is effective as an analgesic supplement and can reduce hospital discharge times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/98/2/533.short "The Effect of Hemispheric Synchronization on Intraoperative Analgesia"], Lewis, Osborn &amp; Roth, Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia, Vol 98 2, February 2004, p533-536&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/110/1/208.abstract "Hemispheric Synchronized Sounds and Perioperative Analgesic Requirements"], Dabu-Bondoc, Vadivelu, Benson, Perret &amp; Kain, Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia, Vol 110 1, January 2010, p208-210&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institute has an affiliated professional membership, and also publishes scientific papers on a subset of its own studies of [[altered states of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allthingspsychic.com/AccessingAnomalousStates.html "Accessing Anomalous States of Consciousness with a Binaural Beat Technology"], F Holmes Atwater, ''[[Journal of Scientific Exploration]]'', Vol 1, No 3, 1997, p263-274&lt;/ref&gt;  In its in-house laboratory, these states or focus levels are typically induced by delivering [[Hemi-Sync]] signals to subjects performing relaxation procedures inside a shielded, sense-depriving [[isolation tank]].  Progression through states is detected and monitored by measurement of peripheral skin temperature, [[galvanic skin response]] and DC [[Skin conductance|skin potential voltage]].

==Coverage==
In 1994, a front page article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported confirmation from the former director of the [[Intelligence and Security Command]] of the [[U.S. Army]] sending personnel to the institute.  It also stated the opinion of the head{{who|date=July 2018}} of the [[Zen Buddhist]] temple in [[Vancouver]] British Columbia that "Gateway students can reach meditation states in a week that took [me] 30 years of sitting".&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;Bob Ortega, "Research institute shows people a way out of their bodies", ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 20, 1994, pp. A1, A8.&lt;/ref&gt;

A reporter for ''[[The Hook (newspaper)|The Hook]]'', weekly newspaper for [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], who visited The Monroe Institute said, "...with a few exceptions, the only 'normal' people with whom I could fully identify were the trainers, who seemed remarkably well-grounded for people whose day-to-day experiences include [[astral projection]] and disembodied spirits".&lt;ref name="TheHook"&gt;Stephen Barling, "[http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2003/02/13/coverStoryCosmicDegreesOut.html Cosmic degrees: Out of body at the Monroe Institute]". ''The Hook''. February 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reporter also concluded that "there is something significant being developed at the Institute. Whether it's just a brilliant [[guided meditation]] (complete with trance-inducing stereoscopic sound) or a doorway to a world of spirit entities, I cannot say".&lt;ref name="TheHook"/&gt;

==Hemi-Sync==

{{Main article|Hemi-Sync}}

In 1975, Monroe registered the first of several patents&lt;ref name="freepatentsonline.com"&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3884218.html US Patent 3884218: "Method of inducing and maintaining various stages of sleep in the human being"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5213562.html US Patent 5213562: "Method of inducing mental, emotional and physical states of consciousness, including specific mental activity, in human beings"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5356368.html US Patent 5356368: "Method of and apparatus for inducing desired states of consciousness"]&lt;/ref&gt; concerning audio techniques designed to stimulate brain functions until the left and right hemispheres became synchronized. Monroe held that this state, dubbed [[Hemi-Sync]] (hemispherical synchronization), could be used to promote mental well-being or to trigger an [[altered state of consciousness]]. Monroe's concept was based on an earlier hypothesis known as [[binaural beats]] and has since been expanded upon a commercial basis by the self-help industry.&lt;ref name=sheikh1&gt;Sheikh, Anees A.(2003) "Healing Images: The Role Of Imagination in Health", Baywood Publishing, {{ISBN|0-89503-208-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hemi-Sync''' is a [[trademark]]ed brand name for a patented process&lt;ref name="freepatentsonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; used to create audio patterns containing [[binaural beats]], which are commercialized in the form of audio CDs. Interstate Industries Inc., created by Hemi-Sync founder Robert Monroe, is the owner of the Hemi-Sync technology.  
    
''Hemi-Sync'' is short for ''Hemispheric Synchronization'', also known as ''[[brainwave synchronization]]''. Monroe indicated that the technique synchronizes the two hemispheres of one's brain, thereby creating a 'frequency-following response' designed to evoke certain effects. Hemi-Sync has been used for many purposes, including relaxation and [[sleep induction]], learning and memory aids, helping those with physical and mental difficulties, and reaching [[altered states of consciousness]] through the use of sound.
    
The technique involves using sound waves to entrain brain waves. Wearing [[headphones]], Monroe claimed that brains respond by producing a third sound (called [[binaural beats]]) that encouraged various brainwave activity changes.&lt;ref name="TheHook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadigh"&gt;, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20061115234056/http://www.monroeinstitute.com/content.php?content_id=33]". The Effects of Hemi-Sync on Electrocortical Activity, Sadigh and Kozicky&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a University of Virginia presentation at the Society for Psychophysiologial Research examined Monroe's claim. The presentation demonstrated that [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] changes did not occur when the standard electromagnetic headphones of Monroe's setup were replaced by air conduction headphones, which were connected to a remote transducer by rubber tubes. This suggests that the basis for the entrainment effects is electromagnetic rather than acoustical.&lt;ref&gt;Chandra Stone, Phyllis Thomas, Dennis McClain-Furmanski, &amp; James E. Horton (2002). "EEG oscillations and binaural beat as compared with electromagnetic headphones and air-conduction headphones", Psychophysiology vol 39, pp. S80&lt;/ref&gt;

Replicated, double-blind, randomized trials on anesthetized patients have found Hemi-Sync effective as a partial replacement for [[fentanyl]] during surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kliempt P, Ruta D, Ogston S, Landeck A, Martay K |title=Hemispheric-synchronisation during anaesthesia: a double-blind randomised trial using audiotapes for intra-operative nociception control |journal=Anaesthesia |volume=54 |issue=8 |pages=769–73 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10460529 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2044.1999.00958.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lewis AK, Osborn IP, Roth R |title=The effect of hemispheric synchronization on intraoperative analgesia |journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=533–6, table of contents |date=February 2004 |pmid=14742401 |url=http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14742401 |doi=10.1213/01.ane.0000096181.89116.d2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar study found it ineffective at replacing [[propofol]] however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dabu-Bondoc S, Drummond-Lewis J, Gaal D, McGinn M, Caldwell-Andrews AA, Kain ZN |title=Hemispheric synchronized sounds and intraoperative anesthetic requirements |journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=772–5 |date=September 2003 |pmid=12933400 |url=http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12933400 |doi=10.1213/01.ane.0000076145.83783.e7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Romania}}
The '''Romanian Revolution''' ({{lang-ro|Revoluția Română}}) was a period of [[revolution|violent civil unrest]] in the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]] in December 1989 and part of the [[Revolutions of 1989]] that occurred in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/574200.stm |title=EUROPE &amp;#124; Romania's bloody revolution |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian Revolution started in the city of [[Timișoara]] and soon spread throughout the country, ultimately culminating in the [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu|show trial]] and execution of longtime [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]] General Secretary [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] and his wife [[Elena Ceaușescu|Elena]], and the end of [[Socialist Republic of Romania|42 years of Communist rule]] in Romania. It was also the last removal of a [[Marxist-Leninist government]] in a [[Warsaw Pact]] country during the events of 1989, and the only one that violently overthrew a country's government and executed its leader.

Early protests occurred in the city of Timișoara in mid-December on the part of the [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarian minority]] in response to an attempt by the government to evict [[Magyars|Hungarian]] [[Reformed churches|Reformed church]] pastor [[László Tőkés]]. In response, Romanians sought revolution and a change in government in light of similar recent events in neighbouring nations. The country's ubiquitous [[secret police]] force, the [[Securitate]], which was both one of the largest in the [[Eastern Bloc]] and for decades had been the main suppressor of popular dissension, frequently and violently quashing political disagreement, ultimately proved powerless in stopping the looming, and then highly fatal and successful revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=By CRAIG S.

Social and economic malaise had been present in socialist Romania for quite some time, especially during the austerity years of the 1980s. The [[1980s austerity policy in Romania|austerity measures]] were designed in part by Ceaușescu to repay foreign debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://europeaneconomics.wordpress.com/2012/05/31/austerity-and-regime-collapse-in-1980s-romania/ |title=Austerity and Regime Collapse in 1980s Romania (part two) &amp;#124; Heterodox |publisher=Europeaneconomics.wordpress.com |date=2012-05-31 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after a [[Ceaușescu's final speech|botched public speech]] by Ceaușescu in [[Bucharest]] (Romania's capital city) that was broadcast to millions of Romanians on state television, rank-and-file members of the military switched, almost unanimously, from supporting the dictator to backing the protesting population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirshman |first=Michael |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Velvet_And_Blood_In_Eastern_Europes_Season_Of_Change/1870373.html |title=Blood And Velvet In Eastern Europe's Season Of Change |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2009-11-06 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riots, street violence and murder in several Romanian cities over the course of roughly a week led the Romanian strongman to flee the capital city on 22 December with his wife, Deputy Prime Minister [[Elena Ceaușescu]].  Evading capture by hastily departing via helicopter effectively portrayed the couple as both fugitives and also acutely guilty of accused crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mamaiaholiday.wordpress.com/2011/04/ |title=April &amp;#124; 2011 &amp;#124; |publisher=Mamaiaholiday.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captured in [[Târgoviște]], they were tried by a [[drumhead court-martial|drumhead military tribunal]] on charges of [[genocide]], damage to the national economy and abuse of power to execute military actions against the Romanian people. They were convicted on all charges, sentenced to death, and immediately executed on Christmas Day 1989, becoming the last people condemned to death and [[Death penalty in Romania|executed in Romania]].

==Background==
{{Further|1980s austerity policy in Romania|Brașov Rebellion|Dissent in Romania under Nicolae Ceaușescu}}
In 1981 Ceaușescu began an [[1980s austerity policy in Romania|austerity programme]] designed to enable Romania to liquidate its entire [[Government debt|national debt]] ($10 billion). To achieve this, many basic goods—including gas, heat and food—were rationed, which drastically reduced the [[standard of living]] and increased [[malnutrition]]. The [[infant mortality]] rate also grew to be the highest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[secret police]], ''[[Securitate]]'', had become so omnipresent that it made Romania essentially a [[police state]]. Free speech was limited and opinions that did not favour the [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]] were forbidden. The large numbers of Securitate informers made organised dissent nearly impossible. The regime deliberately played on this sense that everyone was being watched to make it easier to bend the people to the Party's will.&lt;ref name= Revolution1989 /&gt; Even by Soviet-bloc standards, the Securitate was exceptionally brutal.&lt;ref name = "smith"&gt;{{Citation | first = Craig S | last = Smith | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/world/europe/12spooks.html | title = Eastern Europe Struggles to purge Security Services | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 12 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceaușescu created a [[Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality|cult of personality]], with weekly shows in stadiums or on streets in different cities dedicated to him, his wife and the Communist Party. There were several [[megalomaniac]] projects, such as the construction of the grandiose House of the Republic (today the [[Palace of the Parliament]])—the biggest palace in the world—the adjacent [[Centrul Civic]] and a never-completed museum dedicated to communism and Ceaușescu, today the [[Casa Radio]]. These and similar projects drained the country's finances and aggravated the already dire economic situation. Thousands of Bucharest residents were evicted from their homes, which were subsequently demolished to make room for the huge structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lake |first=Quintin |url=http://blog.quintinlake.com/2011/12/12/photos-ceausescus-palace-of-the-parliament-bucharest/ |title=Photos: Ceausescu's Palace of the Parliament, Bucharest &amp;#124; Geometry &amp; Silence |publisher=Blog.quintinlake.com |date=2011-12-12 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the other [[Warsaw Pact]] leaders, Ceaușescu had not been slavishly pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] but rather had pursued an "independent" foreign policy; Romanian forces did not join its Warsaw Pact allies in putting an end to the [[Prague Spring]]—an [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion]] Ceaușescu openly denounced—while [[Romania at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Romanian athletes]] competed at the Soviet-boycotted [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles (receiving a standing ovation at the opening ceremonies and proceeding to win 53 medals, trailing only the US and [[West Germany]] in the overall count).&lt;ref name = lat_ovation&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitchell| first = Houston |title = L.A.'s greatest sports moments No. 3: 1984 Olympics opening|url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2011/12/las-greatest-sports-moments-no-3-the-1984-olympics-opening-ceremony.html |work= The Los Angeles Times| date =9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=medal_tab&gt;{{cite web|title=1984 Los Angeles Summer Games|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1984/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707092752/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1984/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 July 2008|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, while Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] spoke of reform, Ceaușescu maintained a hard political line and cult of personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/items/show/692 |title=Minutes of the Meeting between Nicolae Ceausescu and Mikhail Gorbachev, December 1989 &amp;#124; Making the History of 1989 |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |date=1990-01-09 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The austerity programme started in 1981 and the widespread poverty it introduced made the Communist regime very unpopular. The austerity programmes were met with little resistance among Romanians and there were only a few strikes and labour disputes, of which the [[Jiu Valley miners' strike of 1977]] and the [[Brașov Rebellion]] of November 1987 at the truck manufacturer [[Roman (vehicle manufacturer)|Steagul Roșu]] were the most notable. In March 1989 several leading activists of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) criticised Ceaușescu's economic policies in a [[Letter of the Six|letter]], but shortly thereafter he achieved a significant political victory: Romania paid off its external debt of about US $11 billion several months before the time that even the Romanian dictator expected. However, in months following the announcement austerity and a shortage of goods remained the same as before.

It initially appeared that Ceaușescu would weather the wave of revolution sweeping across Eastern Europe. He was formally re-elected for another five-year term as General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party on 24 November at the party's XIV Congress. On the same day, Ceaușescu's counterpart in [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Miloš Jakeš]], resigned along with the entire Communist leadership, effectively ending Communist rule in Czechoslovakia.  On 11 November 1989, before the party congress, on Bucharest's Brezoianu Street and Cogălniceanu Boulevard students from [[Cluj-Napoca]] and Bucharest demonstrated with placards saying, "We want reforms against Ceaușescu government."{{clarify|date=January 2016|reason=Was this how it was written, in poor English?}}

The students—including Mihnea Paraschivescu, Grațian Vulpe and the economist Dan Căprariu-Schlachter from Cluj—were detained and investigated by the Securitate at the Rahova Penitentiary on suspicion of propaganda against the socialist society. They were released on 22 December 1989 at 14:00. There were other letters and attempts to draw attention to the economic, cultural and spiritual oppression of Romanians, but they served only to intensify the activity of the police and Securitate. {{source?|date=August 2018}}

Another factor in the revolution was the [[Decreței]] policy, a policy banning contraception and abortion. This policy, which began in 1967, resulted in a [[baby boom]], but also resulted in high rates of poverty and [[child mortality]]. By 1989 these children had all reached adulthood, and many of them were among the students who started the revolution that overthrew Ceaușescu. {{source?|date=August 2018}}

==Timișoara uprising==
{{Revolution sidebar}}
[[File:1989 December 16. sugárút és a Tudor Vladimirescu út kereszteződése. Fortepan 31892.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstration in Timișoara]]

On 16 December 1989 the [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarian minority]] in [[Timișoara]] held a public protest in response to an attempt by the government to evict [[Magyars|Hungarian]] [[Reformed churches|Reformed church]] Pastor [[László Tőkés]]. In July of that year Tőkés had criticised the regime's [[Systematization (Romania)|Systematisation policy]]&lt;ref name="Roper, p.59"&gt;Roper, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; in an interview with Hungarian television,&lt;ref name="Brubaker, Rogers 2006, page 119"&gt;Brubaker, Rogers: ''Nationalist politics and everyday ethnicity in a Transylvanian town''. Princeton University Press, 2006, page 119. {{ISBN|0-691-12834-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and complained that Romanians did not even know their human rights. As Tőkés described it later, the interview, which had been seen in the border areas and was then spread all over Romania, had "a shock effect upon the Romanians, the [[Securitate]] as well, on the people of Romania. […] [I]t had an unexpected effect upon the public atmosphere in Romania."&lt;ref name="Eisernen Vorhang 2008"&gt;Der Grenzer am Eisernen Vorhang. Part 4. A film by Sylvia Nagel. LE Vision GmbH. Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDT), 2008. Broadcast by [[YLE]] Teema, 3 Jan 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government then alleged that Tőkés was [[inciting ethnic hatred]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}. At the behest of the government, his bishop removed him from his post, thereby depriving him of the right to use the apartment to which he was entitled as a pastor, and assigned him to be a pastor in the countryside. For some time his parishioners gathered around his home to protect him from harassment and eviction. Many passersby spontaneously joined in. As it became clear that the crowd would not disperse, the mayor, Petre Moț, made remarks suggesting that he had overturned the decision to evict Tőkés. Meanwhile, the crowd had grown impatient and, when Moț declined to confirm his statement against the planned eviction in writing, the crowd started to chant anti-communist slogans. Subsequently, police and ''Securitate'' forces showed up at the scene. By 19:30 the protest had spread and the original cause became largely irrelevant.

Some of the protesters attempted to burn down the building that housed the district committee of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR). The ''Securitate'' responded with [[tear gas]] and water jets, while police beat up rioters and arrested many of them. Around 21:00 the rioters withdrew. They regrouped eventually around the [[Timișoara Orthodox Cathedral|Romanian Orthodox Cathedral]] and started a protest march around the city, but again they were confronted by the security forces.

===Crackdown===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
Riots and protests resumed the following day, 17 December. The rioters broke into the district committee building and threw party documents, propaganda brochures, Ceaușescu's writings and other symbols of communist power out of the windows.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ștefănescu, pp. 1-27&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Romania, Transylvania, Timisoara Fortepan 31879.jpg|thumb|left|People detained after December 22, 1989 in Timișoara]]
The military were sent in to control the riots because the situation was too large for the ''Securitate'' and conventional police to handle. The significance of the army presence in the streets was an ominous one: It meant that they had received their orders from the highest level of the command chain, presumably from Ceaușescu himself. The army failed to establish order; and chaos ensued including gunfire, fights, casualties and burned cars. [[TAB (Romanian Land Forces)|Transportor Amfibiu Blindat]] (TAB) [[armored personnel carriers|armoured personnel carriers]] and tanks were called in.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Román Nemzeti Színház és Operaház, T-55 harckocsi. Romániai forradalom. Fortepan 31905.jpg|thumb|T-55 tank in front of Opera House]]
After 20:00, from Piața Libertății (Liberty Square) to the Opera there was wild shooting, including the area of Decebal bridge, Calea Lipovei (Lipovei Avenue) and Calea Girocului (Girocului Avenue). Tanks, trucks and TABs blocked the accesses into the city while helicopters hovered overhead. After midnight the protests calmed down. Ion Coman, Ilie Matei and [[Ștefan Gușă]] ([[Chief of the Romanian General Staff]]) &lt;!-- readers need to know the rank of Ion Coman and Ilie Matei, please write this here --&gt; inspected the city. Some areas looked like the aftermath of a war: destruction, rubble and blood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the morning of 18 December the centre was being guarded by soldiers and ''Securitate'' agents in plainclothes. Mayor Moț ordered a party gathering to take place at the university, with the purpose of condemning the "vandalism" of the previous days. He also declared [[martial law]], prohibiting people from going about in groups of larger than two.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Defying the curfew, a group of 30 young men headed for the Orthodox cathedral, where they stopped and waved a [[Flag of Romania#1989: the revolution|Romanian flag]] from which they had removed the Romanian Communist coat of arms. Expecting that they would be fired upon, they started to sing "[[Deșteaptă-te, române!]]" (''"Awaken thee, Romanian!"''), an earlier patriotic song that had been banned since 1947. They were, indeed, fired upon; some died and others were seriously injured, while the lucky ones were able to escape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 19 December Radu Bălan and Ștefan Gușă &lt;!-- readers need to know the rank of Radu Bălan, please write this here --&gt; visited workers in the city's factories, but failed to get them to resume work. On 20 December massive columns of workers entered the city. About 100,000 protesters occupied Piața Operei (Opera Square – today Piața Victoriei, Victory Square) and chanted anti-government slogans: ''"Noi suntem poporul!"'' ("We are the people!"), ''"Armata e cu noi!"'' ("The army is on our side!"), ''"Nu vă fie frică, Ceaușescu pică!"'' ("Have no fear, Ceaușescu is falling!")&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Emil Bobu]] (Secretary to the Central Committee) and Prime Minister [[Constantin Dăscălescu]] were sent by Elena Ceaușescu (Nicolae being at that time in [[Iran]]) to resolve the situation. They met with a delegation of the protesters and agreed to free the majority of the arrested protesters. However, they refused to comply with the protesters' main demand (resignation of Ceaușescu) and the situation remained essentially unchanged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The next day trains loaded with workers from factories in [[Oltenia]] arrived in Timișoara. The regime was attempting to use them to repress the mass protests, but after a brief encounter they ended up joining the protests. One worker explained, "Yesterday our factory boss and a party official rounded us up in the yard, handed us wooden clubs and told us that Hungarians and 'hooligans' were devastating Timișoara and that it is our duty to go there and help crush the riots. But I realised that wasn't the truth."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 18 December Ceaușescu had departed for a visit to Iran, leaving the duty of crushing the Timișoara revolt to his subordinates and his wife. Upon his return on the evening of 20 December the situation became even more tense, and he gave a televised speech from the TV studio inside the Central Committee Building (CC Building) in which he spoke about the events at Timișoara in terms of an "interference of foreign forces in Romania's internal affairs" and an "external aggression on Romania's sovereignty."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The country, which had no information about the Timișoara events from the national media, heard about the Timișoara revolt from Western radio stations like [[Voice of America]] and [[Radio Free Europe]], and by word of mouth. A mass meeting was staged for the next day, 21 December, which, according to the official media, was presented as a "spontaneous movement of support for Ceaușescu," emulating the 1968 meeting in which Ceaușescu had spoken against the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]] by Warsaw Pact forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Ceaușescu's speech===
{{Main|Ceaușescu's final speech}}
[[File:Revolutie Bucuresti1.JPG|thumb|left|The balcony where Ceaușescu delivered his last speech, taken over by the crowd during the Romanian Revolution of 1989.]]
[[File:PozeRevolutia1989clujByRazvanRotta13.jpg|thumb|Protesters in [[Cluj-Napoca]] on the morning of 21 December. This photo was taken by Răzvan Rotta after security forces opened fire.]]

On the morning of 21 December, Ceaușescu addressed an assembly of approximately 100,000 people to condemn the uprising in Timișoara. Party officials took great pains to make it appear that Ceaușescu was still immensely popular. Several busloads of workers, under threat of being fired, arrived in Bucharest's Piața Palatului (Palace Square, now [[Revolution Square, Bucharest|Piața Revoluției]] – Revolution Square) and were given red flags, banners and large pictures of Ceaușescu. They were augmented by bystanders who were rounded up on Calea Victoriei.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989&gt;{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The speech was typical of most of Ceaușescu's speeches over the years. Making liberal use of Marxist-Leninist jargon, he delivered a litany of the achievements of the "socialist revolution" and Romanian "multi-laterally developed socialist society". He blamed the Timișoara uprising on "fascist agitators". However, Ceaușescu was out of touch with his people and completely misread the crowd's mood. The people remained unresponsive, and only the front rows supported Ceaușescu with cheers and applause. About two minutes into the speech, some in the crowd actually began to jeer, boo, whistle and yell insults at him, a reaction unthinkable for most of his rule. Workers from a Bucharest power plant started chanting "Ti-mi-șoa-ra! Ti-mi-șoa-ra!", which was soon picked up by others in the crowd. In response, Ceaușescu raised his right hand in hopes of silencing the crowd; his stunned expression remains one of the defining moments of the end of Communism in Eastern Europe. He then tried to placate the crowd by offering to raise workers' salaries by 200 [[Romanian leu|lei]] per month (about 9 [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] at the time, yet a 5%–10% raise for a modest salary) and student scholarships from 100 to 110 lei while continuing to praise the achievements of the Socialist Revolution. However, a revolution was brewing right in front of his eyes.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt;

As Ceaușescu was addressing the crowd from the balcony of the [[Ministry of Administration and Interior (Romania)|Central Committee building]], sudden movement came from the outskirts of the massed assembly, as did the sound of (what various sources have reported as) fireworks, bombs or guns, which together caused the assembly to break into chaos. Initially frightened, the crowds tried to disperse. [[Bullhorn]]s then began to spread the news that the Securitate was firing on the crowd and that a "revolution" was unfolding. This persuaded people in the assembly to join in. The rally turned into a protest demonstration.

The entire speech was being broadcast live nationwide. Censors attempted to cut the live video feed and replace it with Communist propaganda songs and video praising the Ceaușescu regime, but parts of the riots had already been broadcast and most of the Romanian people realised that something unusual was in progress. Ceaușescu and his wife, as well as other officials and CPEx members, panicked; Ceaușescu's bodyguard hustled him back inside the building.

The jeers and whistles soon erupted into a riot; the crowd took to the streets, placing the capital, like Timișoara, in turmoil. Members of the crowd spontaneously began shouting anti-Ceaușescu slogans, which spread and became chants: ''"Jos dictatorul!"'' ("Down with the dictator"), ''"Moarte criminalului!"'' ("Death to the criminal"), ''"Noi suntem poporul, jos cu dictatorul!"'' ("We are the People, down with the dictator"), ''"Ceaușescu cine ești?/Criminal din Scornicești"'' ("Ceaușescu, who are you?  A criminal from [[Scornicești]]").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Protesters eventually flooded the city centre area, from Piața Kogălniceanu to [[Piața Unirii]], [[Piața Rosetti]] and [[Piața Romană]]. In one notable scene from the event, a young man waved a [[History of the flags of Romania#Flag of the Romanian Revolution of 1989|tricolour]] with the Communist coat of arms torn out of its centre while perched on the statue of [[Mihai Viteazul]] on Boulevard Mihail Cogălniceanu in the [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]]. Many others began to emulate the young protester, and the waving and displaying of the Romanian flag with the Communist insignia cut out quickly became widespread.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Street confrontations===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tanks in Bucharest - 1989 Romanian Revolution.jpg|thumb|Tanks rolled down a main street in central Bucharest.]] --&gt;
As the hours passed many more people took to the streets. Later, observers claimed that even at this point, had Ceaușescu been willing to talk, he might have been able to salvage something. Instead, he decided on force.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt;  Soon the protesters—unarmed and unorganised—were confronted by soldiers, tanks, APCs, [[Brigada Antiteroristă|USLA]] troops (''Unitatea Specială pentru Lupta Antiteroristă'', anti-terrorist special squads) and armed plainclothes ''[[Securitate]]'' officers. The crowd was soon being shot at from various buildings, side streets and tanks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There were many casualties, including deaths, as victims were shot, clubbed to death, stabbed and crushed by armoured vehicles. One APC drove into the crowd around the [[InterContinental Bucharest|InterContinental Hotel]], crushing people. A French journalist, Jean-Louis Calderon, was killed. A street near University Square was later named after him, as well as a high school in Timișoara.

Belgian journalist [[Danny Huwé]] was shot and killed on 23 or 24 December 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newseum.org/scripts/Journalist/Detail.asp?PhotoID=50 |title=Details for HUWE, DANNY |publisher=Newseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302223000/http://www.newseum.org/scripts/Journalist/Detail.asp?PhotoID=50 |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=APPublished: 26 December 1989 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/26/world/upheaval-in-the-east-2-journalists-killed-in-rumanian-combat.html?pagewanted=1 |title=UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST; 2 Journalists Killed in Rumanian Combat - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-12-26 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enciclopediaromaniei.ro/wiki/Danny_Huwe |title=Danny Huwe - Enciclopedia României - prima enciclopedie online despre România |language=ro |publisher=Enciclopediaromaniei.ro |date= |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firefighters hit the demonstrators with powerful water jets, and the police continued to beat and arrest people. Protesters managed to build a defensible barricade in front of the ''Dunărea'' ("Danube") restaurant, which stood until after midnight, but was finally torn apart by government forces. Intense shooting continued until after 03:00, by which time the survivors had fled the streets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Records of the fighting that day include footage shot from [[helicopter]]s that were sent to raid the area and record evidence for eventual reprisals, as well as by tourists in the high tower of the centrally located InterContinental Hotel, next to the [[Romanian National Theater|National Theatre]] and across the street from the university.

It is likely that in the early hours of 22 December the Ceaușescus made their second mistake. Instead of fleeing the city under cover of night, they decided to wait until morning to leave. Ceaușescu must have thought that his desperate attempts to crush the protests had succeeded, because he apparently called another meeting for the next morning. However, before 07:00, his wife Elena received the news that large columns of workers from many industrial platforms (large communist-era factories or groups of factories concentrated into industrial zones) were heading towards the city centre of Bucharest to join the protests. The police barricades that were meant to block access to [[University Square, Bucharest|Piața Universității]] (University Square) and Palace Square proved useless. By 09:30 University Square was jammed with protesters. Security forces (army, police and others) re-entered the area, only to join with the protesters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:ABI100 KingFerdinandMuseum.jpg|thumb|left| 260px| An [[ABI (armored vehicle)|ABI]] armoured car used by the [[Brigada Antiteroristă|USLA]] in December 1989]]
By 10:00, as the radio broadcast was announcing the introduction of martial law and a ban on groups larger than five persons, hundreds of thousands of people were gathering for the first time, spontaneously, in central Bucharest (the previous day's crowd had come together at Ceaușescu's orders). Ceaușescu attempted to address the crowd from the balcony of the Central Committee of the Communist Party building, but his attempt was met with a wave of disapproval and anger. Helicopters spread manifestos (which did not reach the crowd, due to unfavourable winds) instructing people not to fall victim to the latest "diversion attempts," but to go home instead and enjoy the Christmas feast. This order, which drew unfavourable comparisons to [[Marie Antoinette]]'s haughty (but apocryphal) "[[Let them eat cake]]", further infuriated the people who did read the manifestos; many at that time had trouble procuring such basic foodstuffs as cooking oil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Military defection and Ceaușescu's fall==
At approximately 09:30 on the morning of 22 December [[Vasile Milea]], Ceaușescu's minister of defence, died under suspicious circumstances. A communiqué by Ceaușescu stated that Milea had been sacked for treason, and that he had committed suicide after his treason was revealed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most widespread opinion at the time was that Milea hesitated to follow Ceaușescu's orders to fire on the demonstrators, even though tanks had been dispatched to downtown Bucharest that morning.  Milea was already in severe disfavour with Ceaușescu for initially sending soldiers to Timișoara without live [[ammunition]]. Rank-and-file soldiers believed that Milea had actually been murdered and went over virtually ''en masse'' to the revolution. Senior commanders wrote off Ceaușescu as a lost cause and made no effort to keep their men loyal to the regime. This effectively ended any chance of Ceaușescu staying in power.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt;

Accounts differ about how Milea died. His family and several junior officers believed he had been shot in his own office by the Securitate, while another group of officers believed he had committed suicide.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt;  In 2005 an investigation concluded that the minister killed himself by shooting at his heart, but the bullet missed the heart, hit a nearby artery and led to his death shortly afterward.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Upon learning of Milea's death, Ceaușescu appointed [[Victor Stănculescu]] minister of defence. He accepted after a brief hesitation. Stănculescu, however, ordered the troops back to their quarters without Ceaușescu's knowledge, and also persuaded Ceaușescu to leave by helicopter, thus making the dictator a fugitive. At that same moment angry protesters began storming the Communist Party headquarters; Stănculescu and the soldiers under his command did not oppose them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By refusing to carry out Ceaușescu's orders (he was still technically commander-in-chief of the army), Stănculescu played a central role in the overthrow of the dictatorship. "I had the prospect of two execution squads: Ceaușescu's and the revolutionary one!" confessed Stănculescu later. In the afternoon, Stănculescu "chose" [[Ion Iliescu]]'s political group from among others that were striving for power in the aftermath of the recent events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Helicopter extraction===
Following Ceaușescu's second failed attempt to address the crowd, he and Elena fled into a lift (elevator) headed for the roof. A group of protesters managed to force their way into the building, overpower Ceaușescu's bodyguards and make their way through his office before heading onto the balcony. They didn't know it, but they were only a few metres from Ceaușescu. The lift's electricity failed just before it reached the top floor, and Ceaușescu's bodyguards forced it open and ushered the couple onto the roof.&lt;ref name = Revolution1989 /&gt;

At 11:20 on 22 December 1989, Ceaușescu's personal pilot, Lt. Col. Vasile Maluțan, received instructions from Lt. Gen. Opruta to proceed to Palace Square to pick up the president. As he flew over Palace Square he saw it was impossible to land there. Maluțan landed his white [[Eurocopter Dauphin|Dauphin]], #203, on the terrace at 11:44. A man brandishing a white net curtain from one of the windows waved him down.&lt;ref name="GG &amp; WB"&gt;[[George Galloway]] and Bob Wylie, ''Downfall: The Ceaușescus and the Romanian Revolution'', pp. 168–69. Futura Publications, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Maluțan said, "Then Stelica, the co-pilot, came to me and said that there were demonstrators coming to the terrace. Then the Ceaușescus came out, both practically carried by their bodyguards . . . They looked as if they were fainting. They were white with terror. [[Manea Mănescu]] [one of the vice-presidents] and [[Emil Bobu]] were running behind them. Mănescu, Bobu, Neagoe and another Securitate officer scrambled to the four seats in the back . . . As I pulled Ceaușescu in, I saw the demonstrators running across the terrace . . . There wasn't enough space, Elena Ceaușescu and I were squeezed in between the chairs and the door . . . We were only supposed to carry four passengers . . . We had six."&lt;ref name="GG &amp; WB" /&gt;

According to Maluțan, it was 12:08 when they left for [[Snagov]]. After they arrived there, Ceaușescu took Maluțan into the presidential suite and ordered him to get two helicopters filled with soldiers for an armed guard, and a further Dauphin to come to Snagov. Maluțan's unit commander replied on the phone, "There has been a revolution . . . You are on your own . . . Good luck!". Maluțan then said to Ceaușescu that the second motor was now warmed up and they needed to leave soon but he could only take four people, not six. Mănescu and Bobu stayed behind. Ceaușescu ordered Maluțan to head for [[Titu]]. Near Titu, Maluțan says that he made the helicopter dip up and down. He lied to Ceaușescu, saying that this was to avoid anti-aircraft fire, since they would now be in range. Ceaușescu panicked and told him to land.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Galloway]] and Bob Wylie, ''Downfall: The Ceaușescus and the Romanian Revolution'', p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

He did so in a field next to the old road that led to [[Pitești]]. Maluțan then told his four passengers that he could do nothing more. The Securitate men ran to the roadside and began to flag down passing cars. Two cars stopped, one of them driven by a forestry official and one a red [[Automobile Dacia|Dacia]] driven by a local doctor. However, the doctor was not happy about getting involved and, after a short time driving the Ceaușescus, faked engine trouble. A car of a bicycle repair man was then flagged down and he took them to [[Târgoviște]]. The driver of the car, Nicolae Petrișor, convinced them that they could hide successfully in an agricultural technical institute on the edge of town. When they arrived, the director guided the Ceaușescus into a room and then locked them in. They were arrested by local police at about 15:30, then after some wandering around transported to the Târgoviște garrison's military compound and held captive for several days until their trial.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Galloway]] and Bob Wylie, ''Downfall: The Ceaușescus and the Romanian Revolution'', p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Trial and execution===
{{Main|Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu}}
On 24 December Ion Iliescu, head of the newly formed Council of the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]], signed a decree establishing the Extraordinary Military Tribunal, a [[drumhead court-martial]] to try the Ceaușescus for genocide and other crimes. The trial was held on 25 December, lasted for about two hours and delivered death sentences to the couple. Although nominally the Ceaușescus had a right of appeal, their execution followed immediately, just outside the improvised courtroom, being carried out by three paratroopers with their service rifles.

Footage of the trial and of the executed Ceaușescus was promptly released in Romania and to the rest of the world. The actual moment of execution was not filmed since the cameraman was too slow, and he managed to get into the courtyard just as the shooting ended.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Galloway]] and Bob Wylie, ''Downfall: The Ceaușescus and the Romanian Revolution'', p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

In footage of the trial, Nicolae Ceaușescu is seen answering the [[ad hoc]] tribunal judging him and referring to some of its members—among them Army Gen. Victor Atanasie Stănculescu and future Romanian Secret Service head [[Virgil Măgureanu]]—as "traitors". In this same video Ceaușescu dismisses the "tribunal" as illegitimate and demands his constitutional rights to answer to charges in front of a legitimate tribunal.

[[File:Revolutia Bucuresti 1989 019.JPG|thumb|left|[[Petre Roman]] speaking to the crowd in Bucharest.]]
After Ceaușescu left, the crowds in Palace Square entered a celebratory mood, perhaps even more intense than in the other former Eastern Bloc countries because of the recent violence. People cried, shouted and gave each other gifts mainly because it was also close to [[Christmas Day]], which was a long suppressed holiday in Romania. The occupation of the Central Committee building continued.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

People threw Ceaușescu's writings, official portraits and propaganda books out the windows, intending to burn them. They also promptly ripped off the giant letters from the roof making up the word ''"comunist"'' ("communist") in the slogan: "Trăiască Partidul Comunist Român!" ("Long live the Communist Party of Romania!"). A young woman appeared on the rooftop and waved a flag with the coat of arms torn out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At that time fierce fights were underway at [[Henri Coandă International Airport|Bucharest Otopeni International Airport]] between troops sent against each other under claims that they were going to confront terrorists. Early in the morning troops sent to reinforce the airport were fired upon.&lt;ref name=adevarul&gt;[http://www.adevarul.ro/life/dupa_20_de_ani/Crimele_Revolutiei-_Masacrul_de_la_Otopeni_0_171583443.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310202711/http://www.adevarul.ro/life/dupa_20_de_ani/Crimele_Revolutiei-_Masacrul_de_la_Otopeni_0_171583443.html |date=10 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These troops were from the UM 0865 Campina military base, and were summoned there by Gen. Ion Rus, the commander of the Romanian Air Force.&lt;ref name= adevarul /&gt; The confrontation resulted in the deaths of 40 soldiers as well as eight civilians.&lt;ref name= adevarul /&gt; The military trucks were allowed entrance into the airport's perimeter, passing several checkpoints.&lt;ref name= adevarul /&gt; However, after passing the last checkpoint, being on their way to the airport, they were fired upon from different directions.&lt;ref name= adevarul /&gt; A civilian bus was also fired upon during the firefight.&lt;ref name= adevarul /&gt; After the firefight the surviving soldiers were taken prisoner by the troops guarding the airport, who seemed to think that they were loyal to Ceausescu's regime.&lt;ref name= adevarul /&gt;

However, the seizure of power by the new political structure [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN), which "emanated" from the second tier of the Communist Party leadership with help of the plotting generals, was not yet complete. Forces considered to be loyal to the old regime (spontaneously nicknamed "terrorists") opened fire on the crowd and attacked vital points of socio-political life: the television, radio and telephone buildings, as well as Casa Scânteii (the centre of the nation's print media, which serves a similar role today under the name [[Casa Presei Libere]], "House of the Free Press") and the post office in the district of [[Drumul Taberei]]; Palace Square (site of the Central Committee building, but also of the [[Central University Library of Bucharest|Central University Library]], the [[National Museum of Art of Romania|national art museum]] in the former Royal Palace, and the [[Romanian Athaeneum|Ateneul Român]] (Romanian Athaeneum), Bucharest's leading concert hall); the university and the adjoining University Square (one of the city's main intersections); Otopeni and [[Aurel Vlaicu International Airport|Băneasa]] airports; hospitals and the Ministry of Defence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the night of 22–23 December Bucharest residents remained on the streets, especially in the attacked zones, fighting (and ultimately winning, even at the cost of many lives) a battle with an elusive and dangerous enemy. With the military confused by contradictory orders, true battles ensued with many real casualties. At 21:00 on 23 December, tanks and a few paramilitary units arrived to protect the Palace of the Republic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Meanwhile, messages of support were flooding in from all over the world: [[France]] ([[President of the French Republic|President]] [[François Mitterrand]]) ; the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] (President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]); [[Hungary]] (the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]]); the new [[East Germany|East German]] government (at that time the two German states were not yet formally reunited); [[Bulgaria]] ([[Petar Mladenov]], General Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Bulgaria]]); [[Czechoslovakia]] ([[Ladislav Adamec]], leader of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]], and [[Václav Havel]], the dissident writer, revolution leader and future president of the Republic); China (the Minister of Foreign Affairs); the [[United States]] ([[United States President|President]] [[George H.W. Bush]]); [[Canada]] ([[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]]); [[West Germany]] (Foreign Minister [[Hans Dietrich Genscher]]); [[NATO]] (Secretary General [[Manfred Wörner]]); the [[United Kingdom]] (Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]); Spain; [[Austria]]; the [[Netherlands]]; [[Italy]]; [[Portugal]]; [[Japan]] (the [[Japanese Communist Party]]); [[SFR Yugoslavia]] government and [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:C-130 unloading at Bucharest 1989.JPEG|thumb|[[USAF]] [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] unloads medical supplies at the Bucharest airport on 31 December.]]
In the following days, moral support was followed by material support. Large quantities of food, medicine, clothing, medical equipment, and other [[humanitarian aid]] were sent to Romania. Around the world, the press dedicated entire pages and sometimes even complete issues to the Romanian revolution and its leaders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 24 December Bucharest was a city at war. Tanks, APCs and trucks continued to patrol the city and surround trouble spots in order to protect them. At intersections near strategic objectives, roadblocks were built; automatic gunfire continued in and around University Square, the [[Bucharest North Railway Station|Gara de Nord]] (the city's main railroad station) and Palace Square. Yet amid the chaos, some people were seen clutching makeshift [[Christmas trees]]. "Terrorist activities" continued until 27 December, when they abruptly stopped. Nobody ever found out who conducted them, or who ordered their termination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Casualties==

The total number of deaths in the Romanian Revolution was 1,104, of which 162 were in the protests that led to the overthrow of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] (16–22 December 1989) and 942 in the fighting that occurred after the seizure of power by the new political structure [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN). The number of wounded was 3,352, of which 1,107 occurred while Ceaușescu was still in power and 2,245 after the FSN took power.&lt;ref name="Timișoara"&gt;[http://timisoara.com/timisoara/revoluti.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619080849/http://timisoara.com/timisoara/revoluti.htm |date=19 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mioc"&gt;Marius Mioc, ''Revoluția din Timișoara așa cum fost'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Official figures place the death toll of the revolution at 689 people, many of whom were civilians.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;2014 [[Europa World Year Book]], pg. 3758,  {{ISBN|978-1857437140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{outdated section|date=February 2018}}

===Political changes===
The Revolution brought Romania vast attention from the outside world. Initially, much of the world's sympathy went to the National Salvation Front government under [[Ion Iliescu]], a former member of the Communist Party leadership and a Ceaușescu ally prior to falling into the dictator's disfavour in the early 1980s. The National Salvation Front, composed mainly of former members of the second echelon of the Communist Party, immediately assumed control over the state institutions, including the main media outlets such as the national radio and television networks. They used their control of the media in order to launch attacks against their political opponents, newly created political parties that claimed to be successors to those existing before 1948.

Much of that sympathy was squandered during the [[Mineriad]]. Massive protests erupted in downtown Bucharest as political rallies organised by the opposition parties during the presidential elections, with a small part of the protesters deciding to stand ground even after Iliescu was re-elected with an overwhelming majority of 85%. Attempts by police to evacuate the remaining protesters resulted in attacks on state institutions, prompting Iliescu to appeal to the country's workers for help. Infiltrated and instigated by former [[Securitate]] agents, in the following days a large mass of workers, mainly miners, entered Bucharest and attacked and fought with anti-government protesters and gathered bystanders.&lt;ref name="Baleanu"&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/world/romania/g43.html  Baleanu, V.

On the eve of the first free post-communist elections day (20 May 1990), [[Silviu Brucan]]—who was part of the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN)--argued that the 1989 Revolution was not anti-communist, being only against Ceauşescu. He stated that [[Ion Iliescu]] made a "monumental" mistake in "conceding to the crowd" and banning the [[Romanian Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="notagainst"&gt;"Romania revolution 'not against communism'", ''Guardian'', 19 May 1990, Page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Iliescu remained the central figure in Romanian politics for more than a decade, losing the presidency in 1996 before regaining it in 2000; he retired for good in 2004.

While other former ruling Communist parties in the Soviet bloc reconfigured themselves into social democratic or democratic socialist parties, the PCR melted away in the wake of the revolution. However, a number of former PCR politicians remain prominent on Romania's political scene; until the election of [[Klaus Iohannis]] in 2014, every post-1989 president was a former PCR member.

===Economic reforms===
The National Salvation Front chose between the two economic models that political elites claimed were available to post-Communist Eastern European countries: [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] or gradual reforms. The NSF chose the latter, slower reforms, because it would have not been possible to convince the people who were already "exhausted" after Ceaușescu's austerity to undergo further sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] reforms were implemented, although not all at once: by the end of 1990, the prices were liberalised and a free currency exchange rate, devaluing the leu by 60%. The land of the state-owned collective farms was distributed to private owners&lt;ref&gt;Roper, pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt; and a list of 708 large state-owned enterprises to be privatised was devised.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Romania signed an agreement with the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and began the privatisation of state-owned enterprises, with the first [[privatisation]] law being passed in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[Stolojan I Cabinet|Stolojan government]] began an austerity plan, limiting wages and further liberalising prices. The economic situation deteriorated and inflation as well as unemployment increased substantially.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The austerity measures, which by 1995 included a decrease in social spending, led to an increase in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, pp. 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The neoliberal reforms were accelerated after the Democratic Convention won the [[Romanian general election, 1996|1996 elections]], the government using its prerogatives to pass a package of laws, removing subsidies, passing reforms on unemployment benefits and greatly increasing the number of privatised companies.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35259">{{short description|Deaths occurring while scuba diving or as a consequence of scuba diving }}
The risks of dying during [[Recreational diving|recreational]], [[Scientific diving|scientific]] or [[commercial diving]] are small, and on [[Scuba diving|scuba]], deaths are usually associated with poor [[Scuba skills#Breathing gas management|gas management]], poor [[Scuba skills#Buoyancy control, trim and stability|buoyancy control]], equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to [[human error]] on the part of the victim.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;

Equipment failure is rare in [[Scuba set#Open circuit|open circuit scuba]], and while the cause of death is commonly recorded as [[drowning]], this is mainly the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events taking place in water. [[Air embolism]] is also frequently cited as a cause of death, and it, too is the consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed [[Scuba skills#Ascents and descents|ascent]], possibly aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.

'''Scuba diving fatalities''' have a major financial impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;

==Statistics==
Diving fatality data published in Diving Medicine for Scuba Divers (2015)&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;
* 90% died with their [[Diving weights|weight belt]] on. (relevance not specified - ditching the weight belt may have been helpful in many of the cases, but not necessarily all.).
* 86% were alone when they died (either [[Solo diving|diving solo]] or separated from their buddy).
* 50% did not inflate their buoyancy compensator.
* 25% first got into difficulty on the surface
* 50% died on the surface.
* 10% were under training when they died.
* 10% had been advised that they were [[Fitness to dive|medically unfit to dive]].
* 5% were [[cave diving]].
* 1% of rescuers died.

Fatality rates of 16.4 deaths per 100,000 persons per year among [[Divers Alert Network#DAN America|DAN America]] members and 14.4 deaths per 100,000 persons per year the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] (BSAC) members were similar and did not change during 2000-2006. This is comparable with [[jogging]] (13 deaths per 100,000 persons per year) and [[motor vehicle accidents]] (16 deaths per 100,000 persons per year), and within the range where reduction is desirable by [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) criteria,&lt;ref name="Vann and Lang 2011" /&gt;

Data for 17 million [[Diver certification|student-diver certifications]] during 63 million student dives over a 20-year period from 1989-2008 show a mean per capita death rateof 1.7 deaths per 100,000 student divers per year. This was lower than for insured DAN members during 2000-2006 at 16.4 deaths per 100,000 DAN members per year, but fatality rate per dive is a better measure of exposure risk, A mean annual fatality rate of 0.48 deaths per 100,000 student dives per year and 0.54 deaths per 100,000 BSAC dives per year and 1.03 deaths per 100,000 non-BSAC dives per year during 2007. The total size of the diving [[Population (statistics)|population]] is important for determining overall fatality rates, and the population estimates from the 1990s of several million U.S. divers need to be updated.&lt;ref name="Vann and Lang 2011" /&gt;

The most frequent root cause for diving fatalities is running out of or low on gas. Other factors cited include buoyancy control, entanglement or entrapment, rough water, equipment misuse or problems and [[emergency ascent]]. The most common injuries and causes of death were drowning or asphyxia due to inhalation of water, air embolism and cardiac events. Risk of cardiac arrest is greater for older divers, and greater for men than women, although the risks are equal by age 65.&lt;ref name="Vann and Lang 2011" /&gt;

Several plausible opinions have been put forward but have not yet been empirically validated. Suggested contributing factors included inexperience, infrequent diving, inadequate supervision, insufficient predive briefings, [[Buddy diving|buddy]] separation and dive conditions beyond the diver’s training, experience or physical capacity.&lt;ref name="Vann and Lang 2011" /&gt;

==Cause of death==

According to death certificates, over 80% of the deaths were ultimately attributed to drowning, but other factors usually combined to incapacitate the diver in a sequence of events culminating in drowning, which is more a consequence of the medium in which the accidents occurred than the actual accident.  Often the drowning obscures the real [[cause of death]]. Scuba divers should not drown unless there are  other contributory factors as they carry a supply of breathing gas and equipment designed to provide the gas on demand. Drowning occurs as a consequence of preceding problems, such as cardiac disease, pulmonary barotrauma, unmanageable [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], [[unconsciousness]] from any cause, water aspiration, [[Major trauma|trauma]], equipment difficulties, environmental hazards, inappropriate response to an emergency or failure to manage the gas supply.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

The data gathered in relation to the actual causes of death is changing. Although drowning and arterial gas embolisms are cited in the top three causes of diver deaths, stating these as solitary causes does not recognise any pre-existing health issues. Researchers may know the actual causes of death, but the sequence of events that led to the cause of death is often not clear, especially when local officials or pathologists make assumptions.&lt;ref name="Ange 2010" /&gt;

In many [[diving destinations]], resources are not available for comprehensive investigations or complete [[Autopsy|autopsies]], The 2010 DAN Diving Fatalities workshop noted that listing drowning as a cause of death is ineffective in determining what actually occurred in an incident, and that lack of information is the primary reason for personal injury lawsuits filed in the industry.&lt;ref name="Ange 2010" /&gt;

==Manner of death==
If the [[Autopsy#Forensic_autopsy|manner of death]] is deemed to be accidental (or due to misadventure, where this is applicable), which is usually the case, the incident leading to death is seldom analysed sufficiently to be useful in determining the probable sequence of events, particularly the triggering event, and therefore is not usually useful for improving diver safety.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ange 2010" /&gt;

The chain of events leading to diving fatalities is varied in detail, but there are common elements: a triggering event, which leads to a disabling or harmful event and causes a disabling injury, which may itself be fatal or lead to drowning. One or more of the four events may not be unidentifiable.&lt;ref name="Ange 2010" /&gt;

Death usually followed a sequence or combination of events, most of which may have been survivable in isolation. In the more than 940 fatality statistics studied by DAN over ten years, only one third of the triggers could be identified.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ange 2010" /&gt;
# Insufficient gas (41%)
# Entrapment (20%)
# Equipment problems (15%)

Disabling agents were also identified in one third of the cases. The most common identified were:&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;
# Emergency ascent (55%)
# Insufficient gas (27%)
# Buoyancy trouble (13%)

Disabling injuries were identified in nearly two thirds of the cases:&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;
# Asphyxia (33%)
# Arterial gas embolism (29%)
# Cardiac incidents (26%)
# Trauma (5%)
# [[Decompression sickness]] (3.5%)
# Unexplained loss of consciousness (2.5%)
# Inappropriate gas (2%)

==Contributory factors==
The "DAN Annual Diving Report 2016 edition" lists their Ten Most Wanted Improvements in Scuba as:&lt;ref name="Buzzacott 2016" /&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Correct weighting
* Greater buoyancy control
* More attention to gas planning
* Better ascent rate control
* Increased use of checklists
* Fewer equalizing injuries
* Improved cardiovascular health in divers
* Diving more often (or more pre-trip refresher training)
* Greater attention to diving within limits
* Fewer equipment issues / improved maintenance

===Diving techniques===
 
====Inadequate gas supply====
 
The ANZ survey found in 56% of fatalities and the DAN survey in 41%, that the diver was either running low or was out of [[Breathing gas|gas]]. When equipment was tested following death, few victims had an ample gas supply  remaining. The surveys indicated that most problems started when the diver became aware of a low on air situation. 8% of the divers died while trying to snorkel on the surface, apparently trying to conserve air. Concern about a shortage of air may affect the diver's ability to cope with a second problem which may develop during the dive, or may cause the diver to surface early and possibly alone in a stressed state of mind, where he is then unable to cope with surface conditions.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

====Buoyancy problems====

In the ANZ survey, 52% of the fatalities had buoyancy problems. Most of these were due to inadequate buoyancy, but 8% had excessive buoyancy. In the DAN survey buoyancy problems were the most common trigger event leading to death. Buoyancy changes associated with [[wetsuits]] were found to be a significant factor. Based on a formula for approximate weight requirement based on wetsuit style and thickness, 40% of the divers who died were found to be grossly over-weighted at the surface. This would have been aggravated by suit compression at depth.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

A correctly [[Diving weights|weighted]] diver should be neutrally buoyant at or near the surface with [[Diving cylinder|cylinders]] nearly empty. In this state, descent and ascent are equally easy. This requires the diver to be slightly negative at the start of the dive, but this and the buoyancy loss due to suit compression should be is easily compensated by partial inflation of the buoyancy compensator. The practice of over-weighting is dangerous at it may overwhelm the capacity of the buoyancy compensator and makes the buoyancy changes with depth more extreme and difficult to correct. A failure of the buoyancy compensator would be exacerbated. This dangerous practice is unfortunately promoted by some instructors as it expedites shallow water training and allows divers to learn to descend without fully learning the appropriate skills.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

In a different survey on buddy diver fatality it was found that regardless of who was first to be low on air, the over-weighted diver was six times more likely to die.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;
 
In spite of being heavily reliant on their buoyancy compensators, many divers also misused them. Examples of this include accidental inflation or over-inflation causing rapid uncontrolled ascents,  confusion between the inflation and dump valves, and inadequate or slow inflation due to being deep or low on air. The drag caused by a buoyancy compensator inflated to offset the weight belt can contribute to exhaustion in divers attempting to swim to safety on the surface. The American Academy of Underwater Sciences reported in 1989 that half the cases of decompression sickness were related to loss of buoyancy control.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt; When twin-bladder buoyancy compensators are used, confusion as to how much gas is in each bladder can lead to a delay in appropriate response, by which time control of the ascent may have already been lost. 

=====Failure to ditch weights=====
90% of the fatalities did not ditch their weights.  Those on the surface had to swim towards safety carrying several kilograms of unnecessary weight, which made staying at the surface more difficult than it needed to be.  In some fatalities the weights had been released but became entangled.  In other cases, the belt could not be released because it was worn under other equipment, or the release buckle was inaccessible because a weight had slid over it, or it had rotated to the back of the body.  Other fatalities have occurred where release mechanisms have failed.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

====Buddy system failures====
In spite of the general acceptance, teaching and recommendation of the [[Buddy diving|buddy system]] by most, if not all [[diver certification]] organisations, only 14% of divers who died still had their buddy with them at the time. In a Hawaiian study 19% of the fatalities died with their buddy present. In the ANZ study 33% of the fatalities either [[Solo diving|dived alone]] or voluntarily separated from their buddies before the incident, 25% separated after a problem developed and 20% were separated by the problem. In the DAN study, 57% of those who started diving with a buddy were separated at the time of death.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

A common cause of separation was one diver running low on air and leaving their buddy to continue the dive alone. In some cases more than two divers dived together, without adequate team planning, leading  to confusion as to who was responsible for whom. Groups of divers following a dive leader without formal buddy pairing before the dive would be split into pairs to surface by the dive leader as they reached low air status. This would frequently pair the least experienced and competent divers for the ascent including those over-breathing due to anxiety.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

In others cases, the survivor was leading the victim and not immediately aware of the problem. It is common for the more experienced diver to lead, and also common for the follower not to remain in a position where he can easily be monitored, so the follower may only get intermittent attention and may be inconveniently situated when something goes wrong. By the time the lead diver notices the absence of the buddy it may be too late to assist.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;
 
=====Buddy rescue=====
In a minority of cases the buddy was present at the time of death. In 1% of cases the buddy died attempting rescue.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

=====Buddy breathing=====
4% of fatalities were associated with failed [[buddy breathing]].&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

In a study of failed buddy breathing conducted  by  NUADC, more than half were attempted at depths greater than 20 metres. In 29% the victim's [[Diving mask|mask]] was displaced, and a lung over-pressure injury occurred in 12.5% of cases. One in 8 victims refused to return the [[demand valve]], however, donating a regulator rarely results in the donor becoming the victim. The use of a secondary ([[octopus regulator]]) second stage or a  completely separate emergency air supply ([[bailout cylinder]])would appear to be a safer alternative.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

===Human factors===

A survey of DAN America members during 2000 to 2006 indicated a low incidence of cardiac-related fatalities in divers less than 40 years old. The rates increased until about 50 years old and stabilised for older divers at a relative risk of approximately 13 times greater than for younger divers. Relative risk for older divers was also found to be greater for asphyxia (3.9 times) and arterial gas embolism (2.5 times). Relative risk between males and females reduced from about 6 to 1 at 25 years to even at 65 years. DAN Europe figure follow a similar trend.&lt;ref name="Denoble et al 2011" /&gt;

The victim had a pre-existing condition which would widely be considered a contraindication to diving in about 25% of fatalities. Some disorders have no demonstrable pathology and are easily overlooked in an investigation, which results in incomplete understanding of the incident. Drowning can obscure some pathologies which may then not show up at autopsy.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

A large percentage (40 to 60%) of deaths in the Edmonds summary were associated with panic, a psychological reaction to stress which is characterized by irrational and unhelpful behaviour, which reduces the chances of survival. Panic typically occurs when a susceptible diver is in a threatening and unfamiliar situation, such as running out of breathing gas, or loss of ability to control depth, and is commonly complicated by inappropriate response to the triggering situation, which generally makes the situation worse. Evidence of panic is derived from behavioural reports from eyewitnesses.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

Fatigue was a factor in a significant number of cases (28% according to Edmonds). Fatigue is caused by excessive exertion, is aggravated by physical unfitness, and reduces the reserves available for survival. Factors cited as causes of fatigue include excessive drag due to over-weighting, drag due to over-inflation of the BCD, and long surface swims in adverse sea conditions, and it was not restricted to unfit divers. Fatigue was also associated with salt-water aspiration syndrome, cardiac problems and asthma.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

Salt water aspiration was a factor in 37% of cases in the Edmonds summary. This refers to inhalation of a small amount of sea water by the conscious diver, often in the form of spray. Salt water aspiration may be caused by regulator a leak, rough conditions on the surface, or residual water in the regulator after regulator recovery or buddy breathing. Salt water aspiration may cause respiratory distress, fatigue or panic and other complications.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

Autopsy evidence of pulmonary barotrauma was found in 13% of the cases summarised by Edmonds et al. This was sometimes a complicating factor, but at other times the direct cause of death. Factors associated with pulmonary barotrauma include panic, rapid buoyant ascent, asthma and regulator failure. In half of these cases a cause for the barotrauma was identified, but a roughly equal number remain unexplained.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

In cases where the Edmonds summary found cardiac failure was implicated there was either gross cardiac pathology or a clinical indication of cardiac disease in the autopsy findings. 26% of deaths in the DAN studies were due to cardiac failure. 60% of these victims complained of chest pain, dyspnoea or feeling unwell before or during the dive. Cardiac causes are implicated in about 45% of scuba deaths in divers over 40 years old, and they tend to be relatively experienced divers, frequently with a history of cardiac disease or high blood pressure. The associated triggers include exercise, drugs, hypoxia from salt water aspiration, cardio-pulmonary reflexes, respiratory abnormalities, restrictive dive suits and harness, and cold exposure.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

in at least 9% of fatalities in the ANZ survey cited by Edmonds et al. the diver was asthmatic, and in at least 8% of the cases asthma contributed to the death. In other surveys this correlation is not so clear. Surveys have shown that between 0.5% and 1% of recreational divers are asthmatics. Edmonds considers that the statistics imply that asthma is a significant risk factor and that asthmatics should not be permitted to dive. This opinion was prevalent for a long time, but recent studies by DAN suggest that asthma may be managed successfully in some cases.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Factors contributing to death in this group include panic, fatigue and salt water aspiration, and the cause of death was usually drowning or pulmonary barotrauma. The diving environment can provoke or aggravate asthma in several ways, such as salt water aspiration, breathing cold dry air, strenuous exertion, hyperventilation. and high work of breathing.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

In 10% of the cases summarised by Edmonds et al., vomiting initiated or contributed to the accident. It was often caused by sea sickness or salt water aspiration or ingestion, but ear problems and alcohol were also cited as causes.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

Nitrogen narcosis was cited as a contributory or triggering factor in 9% of cases reviewed by Edmonds et al., but was never the sole cause of death.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

Respiratory disease&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

Drugs&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

Decompression sickness&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

===Equipment===

Edmonds et al. (2014) suggest that a significant percentage of deaths are associated with equipment failure (35%) or misuse (35%), while the diving fatalities workshop of 2012 found that equipment failure ''per se'' was uncommon. This is not necessarily contradictory, as they include incompetent operation under equipment failure and specify overlap between malfunction and misuse.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

In 14% of deaths there was a regulator fault reported, and in 1% the regulator was misused. Subsequent testing of the regulators showed that most of the problems were caused by leaks resulting in inhalation of salt water, but in some cases there was excessive breathing resistance following a  mechanical dysfunction.  In a few cases the regulator failed catastrophically, or the hose burst. The difficulty of breathing from the regulator was often aggravated by other factors such as panic, exhaustion or badly adjusted buoyancy.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

In 8% of cases the buoyancy compensator malfunctioned. This was usually due to a problem with the inflator mechanism, but in some cases the BCD could not stay inflated. In 6% of the fatalities, the buoyancy compensator was not used competently, usually by overinflation which caused an uncontrolled ascent, or deflating when more buoyancy was required at the surface.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt; Overweighting can also be classified as misuse of equipment.

Edmonds et al. found that 13% of victims lost one or both fins. This was sometimes due to defective or ill fitting fins, but in most cases the cause was not apparent. In 12% of deaths there were problems associated with the cylinder, usually from user error, such as use of an underfilled or undersized cylinder, the cylinder becoming unsecured from the harness, and failure to open the cylinder valve. In less than 5% of fatalities, there were problems due to malfunction or misuse of weight belt (excluding overweighting which is not a failure of the equipment), harness, mask, exposure suit, submersible pressure gauges and entanglement in lines deployed by the diver.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

===Environment===
Edmonds et al. indicate that 25% of fatal incidents started at the surface, and 50% of the divers died at the surface. In many cases they divers surfaced because they ran out of breathing air.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

Difficult water conditions were implicated in 36% of fatalities in the Edmonds et al. summary. These included current stronger than the diver could manage, rough water, surf, surge from wave movement, and impaired visibility caused by these conditions. These conditions were frequently encountered when the diver was obliged to surface in an unsuitable place due to earlier problems, and were often exacerbated by overweighting and/or the high drag of an excessively inflated buoyancy compensator, leading to exhaustion or panic which resulted in drowning.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

Excessive depth was considered a factor in 12% of fatalities summarized by Edmonds et al. The fatal dive was often the deepest ever for the victim. Greater depth can expose a diver to factors such as increased air consumption, impaired judgment caused by nitrogen narcosis, colder water, reduced thermal insulation of a compressed wetsuit, reduced visibility and lighting, slower response of buoyancy compensator inflation, increased work of breathing, greater heat loss when using helium mixtures, higher risk of decompression sickness and a necessarily prolonged ascent time.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

Other environmental factors cited as contributory to fatalities include caves, marine animal injury (including shark and other animal bites, and marine stings, difficulties entering and exiting the water, cold, entanglements, entrapment, and night diving.&lt;ref name="Why divers die" /&gt;

===Experience===

The DAN fatalities workshop of 2011 found that there is a real problem that divers do not follow the procedures they have been trained in, and dive significantly beyond their training experience and fitness levels, and that this the basic cause of most accidents. In litigation involving diving accident, the legal panel reported that 85% to 90% of the cases were attributable to diver error. This is consistent with several scientific studies. Medical issues are a significant part of the problem, and certified divers are responsible for assessing their own fitness and ability to do any particular dive. Experience was also cited as a significant factor, with occasional divers at higher risk than regular divers, and the majority of fatalities had only entry level or slightly higher qualification ("Advanced open-water diver" certification is included in this grouping).&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;

==Accident investigation==

Diving fatality investigations are intended to find the cause of death by identifying causative factors. Three main areas of investigation are common: 
* Medical investigation looks into the diver’s health and medical factors which may have led to the cause of death. 
* Equipment is investigated to look for issues that may have contributed to a cause of death. 
* Procedural investigation considers whether the diver followed appropriate procedures, adequately prepared themselves and their equipment before diving, or went diving in conditions beyond their training and experience level.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lack of solid information about the underlying causes of diving accidents and fatalities creates uncertainty, and this is the principal factor leading to litigation, higher insurance premiums, massive litigation costs and ultimately the continued loss of life.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is usually some form of investigation following a diving fatality. There may be several investigators representing different parties. Police are likely to look for evidence of homicide, The maritime safety authority will investigate in cases where a death occurs while diving from a vessel. When the fatality involves a person at work, the occupational health and safety authority may investigate, and investigators from the deceased's, insurance company and the dive operator and certification agency's insurance companies are likely to be involved.&lt;ref name="Barsky 2011" /&gt;

In most cases, the investigation takes place some time after the event. In cases where death has already occurred, the police may meet the boat, or travel to a shore site. An investigation by someone representing a sector of the diving industry may not take place until weeks or even months after the incident. It depends on how soon the event is reported, how long the paperwork takes, how soon the insurance carrier appoints an investigator and availability of a suitable investigator. No matter how quickly an investigation is launched, in most cases the body will have been recovered and resuscitation attempted, equipment will have been removed and possibly damaged or lost, and the people at the site returned to their homes. The equipment may have been mishandled by authorities who are unfamiliar with the gear and have stored it improperly, compromising the evidence.&lt;ref name="Barsky 2011" /&gt;

People who would be likely to be considered witnesses include:&lt;ref name="Barsky 2011" /&gt;
* Any instructional staff involved if it was a training dive.
* Any crew-members of the boat if the dive was off a boat.
* Other divers who were diving at the site at the time of the incident.
* Any rescue and recovery personnel who may have been involved.
* Any members of a professional dive team if one of their members was involved.

===Equipment testing===
Equipment testing is an important part of dive accident and fatality analysis. As stakeholders in the community have different and occasionally conflicting needs when it comes to such testing, tests should be done as soon as possible to avoid degradation of evidence, and the testing should be done by impartial investigators, with all relevant equipment treated as evidence and legally acceptable procedures for controlling custody of the evidence. Currently the procedures for equipment testing after diving accidents are poorly standardized. Important procedural items include when testing should be conducted, who is responsible for the testing, what equipment should be tested and what tests should be done.&lt;ref name="Bozanic 2011" /&gt;
 
This requires appropriate training of first responders and law enforcement agencies, availability of testing equipment, development of suitable test protocols, and funding to conduct the testing. Procedures for testing rebreathers differ from those for testing open circuit equipment.&lt;ref name="Bozanic 2011" /&gt;

Life-support equipment is an integral part of diving, and dive equipment is generally robust and reliable, but bad maintenance, design flaws, improper use, or other factors may cause or contribute to an incident. When equipment issues are not contributory to an incident, they should be excluded so that the causative factors may be correctly determined.&lt;ref name="Bozanic 2011" /&gt;

===Forensic autopsy===
If diving fatalities are thoroughly investigated it may be possible to determine a trigger, or root cause, for the accident. Data collection and analysis allows identification of the most common triggers and contributing factors associated with fatal diving incidents. Forensic autopsies go beyond the detailed description of the internal organs and include a thorough external examination looking for injuries, injury patterns, trace evidence and clues to how the body and the environment may have interacted. Diving deaths are relatively uncommon, and may be unfamiliar to the pathologist.&lt;ref name="Caruso 2011" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The forensic pathologist also needs to understand the limitations of autopsy findings in diving-related deaths and realize that there are common postmortem artifacts that can be misinterpreted, resulting in erroneous conclusions. James Carruso, Regional Armed Forces Medical Examiner,  Navy Recruiting Command 2011&lt;ref name="Caruso 2011" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legal issues==
Scuba diving fatalities have a major financial impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;

The lack of reliable and reasonably complete information about the underlying causes of diving fatalities 
creates uncertainty. Inaccurate findings following autopsies where the examiner had no experience in diving fatalities and had not followed the relevant protocols are common, and in the majority of cases the primary causative factors are never identified, leading to opportunistic litigation.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2645">A '''serious case review''' (SCR) in England is held after a child or vulnerable adult dies or is seriously injured under circumstances where abuse or neglect are thought to have been involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-protection-system/england/serious-case-reviews/ |title=Child protection in England - Serious case reviews|newspaper= |date=2015  |author=NSPCC |accessdate= 29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to learn lessons to help prevent future similar incidents. Similar procedures in other countries of the UK are called child practice reviews in Wales, case management reviews in [[Northern Ireland]], and significant case reviews in Scotland. An SCR should be held if abuse or neglect is suspected to have been involved, a child has died or been seriously harmed and if there are concerns about the way organisations or professionals worked together to safeguard the child.

==Procedure==
The [[Local Safeguarding Children Board]]s (LSCB) follow [[Statute|statutory]] guidance &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/419595/Working_Together_to_Safeguard_Children.pdf Working together to safeguard children: a guide to inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, Department for Education (DfE), HM Government, London, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; for conducting a serious case review in which the different professionals and organisations  involved and the family are represented. The SCR should be completed within six months.

An SCR may also be commissioned following the death or injury of a vulnerable adult. For example, in 2010 [[Warwickshire County Council]] commissioned an SCR following the death of 27-year old Gemma Hayter, because "a vulnerable adult had died and abuse or neglect is known or
suspected to be a factor in the death; and the case gives rise to concerns about the way in which local professionals and/or services work together to safeguard vulnerable adults".&lt;ref&gt;Warwickshire Safeguarding Adults Partnership, [http://apps.warwickshire.gov.uk/api/documents/WCCC-779-97 Serious Care Review: the Murder of Gemma Hayter], accessed 4 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Like CPR, suspended animation could delay the onset of cell  death (necrosis) in seriously injured or ill patients, providing them with more time to receive definitive medical treatment.]]

'''Suspended animation''' is the inducement of a temporary cessation or decay of main body functions, including the brain, to a hypometabolic state in order to try to preserve its mental and physiological capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/suspended+animation| title=Suspended Animation |publisher=Medical-Dictionary.thefreedictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4060059| title=Is pharmacological, H2S-induced 'suspended animation' feasible in the ICU?|journal=Crit Care.|volume=18|issue=2|p=215|date=2014|doi=10.1186/cc13782| author1=Asfar| first1=P| last2=Calzia| first2=E| last3=Radermacher| first3=P| pmid=25028804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a theoretical concept, it has been included in a wide range of fiction books and films but has not been implemented as a medical procedure for either short or extended time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2202747/terminally-ill-brit-schoolgirl-wins-court-battle-body-cryogenically-frozen-after-death/|title=FROZEN IN TIME Terminally ill Brit schoolgirl, 14, wins court battle to have her body cryogenically frozen for £37k after her death in case she can be resurrected in future|publisher=thesun.co.uk|date=16 November 2016|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic principles ==

[[File:Bonner zoologische Monographien (1975) (20367841916).jpg|thumb|Hazel-mouse, (Muscardinus avellanarius) preparing for hibernation, gaining nearly double its body weight. Bonn, Zoological Research Institute and Museum.]]

Suspended animation has been understood as the slowing or stopping of life processes by exogenous or endogenous means without terminating life itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asfar|first=P.|date=2014|title=Is pharmacological, H2S-induced 'suspended animation' feasible in the ICU?|journal=Critical Care|volume=182|issue=2|pages=215|doi=10.1186/cc13782|pmid=25028804|pmc=4060059}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breathing, heartbeat and other involuntary functions may still occur, but they can only be detected by artificial means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com|title=How do frogs survive winter? Why don't they freeze to death?|publisher=Scientific American|date=11 July 2014|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, this procedure has been associated with a lethargic state in nature when animals or plants appear, over a period, to be dead but then can wake up or prevail without suffering any harm. This has been termed in different contexts [[hibernation]], [[dormancy]] or [[anabiosis]] (this last in some aquatic invertebrates and plants in scarcity conditions).

This condition of apparent death or interruption of vital signs may be similar to a medical interpretation of suspended animation. It is only possible to recover signs of life if the brain and other vital organs suffer no cell deterioration, necrosis or molecular death principally caused by oxygen deprivation or excess temperature (especially high temperature).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://gradestack.com/Dr-Bhatia-Medical/Molecular-death-is-A/2-3042-3166-15605-sf| title=:Molecular death is|publisher=Forensic Medicine_gradestack.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of people that have returned from this apparent interruption of life lasting over half an hour, two hours, eight hours or more while adhering to these specific conditions for oxygen and temperature have been reported and analysed in depth, but these cases are not considered scientifically valid. The brain begins to die after five minutes without oxygen; nervous tissues die intermediately when a "somatic death" occurs while muscles die over one to two hours following this last condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://gradestack.com/Dr-Bhatia-Medical/Definition-of-suspended/19-3042-3166-15605-sf| title=Definition of suspended animation is|publisher=Forensic Medicine_gradestack.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been possible to obtain a successful resuscitation and recover life in some instances, including after anaesthesia, heat stroke, electrocution, narcotic poisoning, heart attack or cardiac arrest, shock, newborn infants, cerebral concussion, cholera, and voluntarily as in [[yogi]]s.

Supposedly, in suspended animation, a person technically would not die, as long as he or she were able to preserve the minimum conditions in an environment extremely close to death and return to a normal living state. An example of such a case is [[Anna Bågenholm]], a Swedish radiologist who allegedly survived 40 minutes under ice in a frozen lake in a state of [[cardiac arrest]] and survived with no brain damage in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/miracle-student-survived-his-body-being-frozen-solid-a6823801.html| title='Miracle' student survived his body being frozen solid|publisher=independent.co.uk|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human hibernation ===

[[File:American toad - Bufo americanus - 3.JPG|thumb|American toad (''Bufo americanus'') is an amphibian that can hibernate in winter.]]

{{main|Therapeutic hypothermia}}
Since the 1970s, [[deep hypothermic circulatory arrest|induced hypothermia]] has been performed for some [[heart surgery|open-heart surgeries]] as an alternative to [[heart-lung machine]]s. Hypothermia, however, provides only a limited amount of time in which to operate and there is a risk of tissue and brain damage for prolonged periods.

There are many research projects currently investigating how to achieve "induced [[hibernation]]" in humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/health/050421_hibernation.html New Hibernation Technique might work on humans | LiveScience] at www.livescience.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article1845294.ece Race to be first to 'hibernate' human beings - Times Online] at www.timesonline.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to hibernate humans would be useful for a number of reasons, such as saving the lives of seriously ill or injured people by temporarily putting them in a state of hibernation until treatment can be given.

The primary focus of research for human hibernation is to reach a state of [[torpor]], defined as a gradual physiological inhibition to reduce oxygen demand and obtain energy conservation by hypometabolic behaviors altering biochemical processes. In previous studies, it was demonstrated that physiological and biochemical events could inhibit endogenous thermoregulation before the onset of hypothermia in a challenging process known as "estivation." This is indispensable to survive harsh environmental conditions, as seen in some amphibians and reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://nature.berkeley.edu/garbelottoat/wp-content/uploads/lee2008-1.pdf|title=Is Human Hibernation Possible?|publisher=nature.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific possibilities ==

=== Temperature-induced ===

Lowering the temperature of a substance reduces chemical activity by the [[Arrhenius equation]]. This includes life processes such as metabolism.

====Hypothermic range====

In June 2005, scientists at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s Safar Center for Resuscitation Research announced they had managed to place [[dog]]s in suspended animation and bring them back to life, most of them without [[brain damage]], by draining the [[blood]] out of the dogs' bodies and injecting a low temperature solution into their [[circulatory system]]s, which in turn keeps the bodies alive in stasis. After three hours of being [[clinically dead]], the dogs' blood was returned to their circulatory systems, and the animals were revived by delivering an [[electric shock]] to their hearts. The heart started pumping the blood around the body, and the dogs were brought back to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/magazine/11ideas_section4-21.html | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Mihm | title=Zombie Dogs | date=11 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 January 2006, doctors from the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] announced they had placed [[pig]]s in suspended animation with a similar technique. The pigs were [[Anesthesia|anaesthetized]] and major blood loss was induced, along with simulated - via scalpel - severe injuries (e.g. a punctured aorta as might happen in a car accident or shooting). After the pigs lost about half their blood the remaining blood was replaced with a chilled saline solution. As the body temperature reached {{convert|10|°C}} the damaged blood vessels were repaired and the blood was returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Does the rate of rewarming from profound hypothermic arrest influence the outcome in a swine model of lethal hemorrhage?|authors=Alam HB, Rhee P, Honma K, Chen H, Ayuste EC, Lin T, Toruno K, Mehrani T, Engel C, Chen Z.|year=2006|issue=1|pmid=16456447 |doi=10.1097/01.ta.0000198469.95292.ec |volume=60 |journal=J Trauma |pages=134–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method was tested 200 times with a 90% success rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/01/20/1137553739997.html|title=Doctors claim suspended animation success|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 January 2006|accessdate=10 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 2014, a team of surgeons from UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh plan to try the above method in gunshot victims (or those suffering from similar traumatic injuries). The trials will be done on ten such severely wounded patients and compared with ten others in similar situation but who had no access to the above method. They currently refer to the procedure as Emergency Preservation and Resuscitation for Cardiac Arrest from trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Left between life and death: First 'suspended animation' trials set to begin in bid to buy time for stabbing and gunshot victims|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2639752/Left-life-death-First-suspended-animation-trials-set-begin-bid-buy-time-stabbing-gunshot-victims.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cryogenic range ====

This concept is speculative as well as frequently misunderstood. Human beings are unable to survive suspended animation at cryogenic (extremely cold) temperatures naturally. The limits of current technology are also insufficient to prevent loss of cellular [[Viability assay|viability]]. [[Cryonics]] operates under a fundamentally distinct paradigm from suspended animation in that it depends on [[future technology]] as part of its premise for working. It is not currently possible to preserve mental capacities and memories by this method and only currently to cells and microorganisms.

''{{Quote |Suspended animation is distinct from cryonics because it does not require this "benefit of the doubt" concerning future technology.  It is something that immediately and demonstrably works.  The medical use of suspended animation will still require optimism that diseases can be cured. |[[Brian Wowk]]&lt;ref&gt;Cryonet 2008 [http://www.cryonet.org/cgi-bin/dsp.cgi?msg=6704 Suspended Animation vs Cryonics]&lt;/ref&gt;}}''

In order to achieve suspended animation, a reliable method to prevent damage to cells would be needed. [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|Vitrification]] can achieve this in the laboratory only for small amounts of tissue due to cooling and other physical limits combined with [[Cryoprotectant#Toxicity|cryoprotectant toxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Fahy|first1=Gregory M.|last2=Wowk|first2=Brian|title=Principles of Cryopreservation by Vitrification|journal=Methods in Molecular Biology|volume=1257|year=2015|pages=30–33|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-2193-5_2|pmid=25428002|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|isbn=978-1-4939-2192-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also only limited evidence that it is possible in principle, because only very small organisms can be vitrified or frozen safely. Research on ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' has shown that memories can be recovered, and such organisms can survive vitrification with around 100% success rates.&lt;ref&gt;Vita-More, Barranco.

=== Chemically induced ===

Some Research institutes like Roth Lab founded by [[Mark Roth (scientist)|Mark Roth]] have studied seriously the possibility of suspended animation, originally for chromosome isolation, and diagnosing several illnesses like cancer.

An article in the 22 April 2005 issue of the scientific journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' reports success towards inducing suspended animation-like [[hypothermia]] in [[mouse|mice]]. The findings are significant, as mice do not hibernate in nature.

The laboratory of Mark B. Roth at the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] in [[Seattle]], Washington, placed the mice in a chamber containing 80 [[Parts per million|ppm]] [[hydrogen sulfide]] for a duration of 6 hours. The core body temperature of the mice dropped to 13 degrees Celsius and [[metabolism]], as assayed by [[carbon dioxide]] production and [[oxygen]] use, decreased 10-fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1108581| pmid = 15845845| year = 2005| last1 = Blackstone | first1 = E.| last2 = Morrison | first2 = M.| last3 = Roth | first3 = M.| title = H2S induces a suspended animation-like state in mice| volume = 308| issue = 5721| pages = 518| journal = Science | citeseerx = 10.1.1.626.8554}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also induced [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] on [[nematode]] embryos and [[zebrafish]] embryos, placing them in suspended animation for hours, and then re-animating them simply by returning the oxygen to the embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/13/7331.full.pdf|title=Oxygen deprivation causes suspended animation in the zebrafish embryo|publisher=pnas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In trauma, the Roth laboratory and institutes such as [[Suspended Animation, Inc]] are trying to implement suspended animation as a medical procedure which involves the therapeutic induction to a complete and temporary systemic [[ischemia]], directed to obtain a state of tolerance for the protection-preservation of the entire organism, this during a circulatory collapse "only by a limited period of one hour". The purpose to avoid a serious injury, risk of brain damage or death, until the patient reaches specialized attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Suspended animation for delayed resuscitation. Crit Care Med. 1996 Feb;24(2 Suppl):S24-47|journal=Critical Care Medicine|volume=24|issue=2 Suppl|pages=S24–47|pmid = 8608704|year = 1996|last1 = Bellamy|first1 = R|last2=Safar|first2=P|last3=Tisherman|first3=S.

[[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]] announced they had been able to hibernate [[mouse|mice]] using the same method. Their heart rate was slowed down from 500 to 200 beats per minute, respiration fell from 120 to 25 breaths per minute and body temperature dropped to 30&amp;nbsp;°C (natural: 39&amp;nbsp;°C). After 2 hours of breathing air without hydrogen sulfide the mice returned to normal. Further studies are needed to see if the gas had damaging effects on the brain, considering the effect of hydrogen sulfide on the body is similar to hydrogen cyanide; it does not slow the metabolic rate but rather inhibits the transfer of energy within the cell via ATP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/5412824.stm|title=Gas induces 'suspended animation'|publisher=BBC News|date=9 October 2006|accessdate=10 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, long term suspended animation has not been attempted.

[[File:Sydney parkinson.jpg|thumb|Sydney Parkinson - self-portrait]]
'''Sydney Parkinson''' (c. 1745 – 26 January 1771) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[botanical illustrator]] and [[natural history]] artist.  He was the first European artist to visit Australia, New Zealand and Tahiti.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Barker, "Wide-eyes on a painted ocean", ''The Guardian'', republished in ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 10 July 1999, Spectrum, p. 13s&lt;/ref&gt;

Parkinson was employed by [[Joseph Banks]] to travel with him on [[James Cook]]'s first voyage to the [[Pacific]] in 1768,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydney Parkinson, botanical draughtsman|url=http://otago.ourheritage.ac.nz/items/show/7583|website=Enlarging the prospects of happiness: European travel writing through the ages. Online exhibition|publisher=University of Otago|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[HMS Endeavour]]. Parkinson made nearly a thousand drawings of plants and animals collected by Banks and [[Daniel Solander]] on the voyage. He had to work in difficult conditions, living and working in a small cabin surrounded by hundreds of specimens. In [[Tahiti]] he was plagued by swarms of flies which ate the paint as he worked. He died at sea on the way to [[Cape Town]] of [[dysentery]] contracted at Princes' Island off the western end of [[Java]]. Banks paid his outstanding salary to his brother.

Parkinson is commemorated in the common and scientific name of the [[Parkinson's petrel]] ''Procellaria parkinsoni''. The great [[Banks' Florilegium|Florilegium]] of his work was finally published in 1988 by Alecto Historical Editions in 35 volumes and has since been digitized by the Natural History Museum in London.

In 1986 he was honoured on a [[postage stamp]] depicting his portrait issued by [[Australia Post]] [http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0015740.jpg]

'''USS ''Annie'' (1862)''' was a [[schooner]] captured by the [[Union Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]]. She was used by the Union Navy as a [[ship's tender]] in support of the Union Navy blockade of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] waterways.

== Blockade runner ''Annie'' captured by USS ''Fort Henry'' ==

On the evening of 26 February 1863, armed boats commanded by Acting Master Robert B. Smith from the Union sidewheel steamer {{USS|Fort Henry|1862|6}} captured ''Anna'' while that [[schooner]] was attempting to slip through the blockade and enter the [[Suwannee River]] with a widely varied cargo from the [[Bahamas]]. The prize's [[Master Mariner|master]], Capt. H. Hanson, acknowledged that he was "...endeavoring to run the blockade."

== Confusion over vessel's lineage ==

The report of this action does not mention that the prize had ever carried any other name. However, later records maintain that she had been called ''La Criala'' when captured and was renamed ''Anna'' at the beginning of her service in the Union Navy. A schooner called ''La Criolla'' had been captured by the Union sidewheeler {{USS|Bienville|1861|6}} some 25 miles southeast of the [[Charleston, South Carolina]], bar and, subsequently, had been condemned and sold by the Federal [[prize court]] at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. It is possible that the purchaser of ''La Criolla'' renamed her ''Anna'' and she was the vessel captured on 26 February 1863 by ''Fort Henry''. If so, she had been built, according to an inspecting officer from ''Bienville'', "...in one of the Northern States in the year 1857, and was [originally] named ''Nora''." However, evidence that this was the case is far from conclusive.

== Acquired by the Union Navy, and assigned to the East Gulf blockade ==

''Anna'' was condemned by the [[Key West, Florida]], [[prize court]] and the Union Navy purchased her on 11 March 1863 for service in the [[East Gulf Blockading Squadron]]. Her name first appeared on the list of vessels composing that squadron in a report dated the 16th and bore the notation, "Tender to ''Dole'', fitting out."

By 1 April 1863, she had begun her active service and was stationed at [[Boca Grande, Florida|Boca Grande]]. However, for some unknown reason, the vessel's name appeared as ''Annie'' and so it remained throughout her naval service. Almost a year later, on 8 March 1864, the squadron commanding officer, Acting Rear Admiral [[Theodorus Bailey (US Navy officer)|Theodorus Bailey]], explained this discrepancy to the Navy Department.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The tender referred to, when captured, was called ''Anna'', but she has, by some inadvertence, been always called the ''Annie'', since being taken into the service of the Government, and I am of the opinion that it would be more convenient to preserve the name of ''Annie''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''Annie'' captures blockade runners ''Mattie'' and ''Dream'' ===

On the morning of the 13th, ''Annie''—Acting Ensign James S. Williams in command—took her first prize, the schooner ''Mattie'' which was attempting to run into the [[Crystal River (Florida)|Crystal River]], [[Florida]], with a diverse cargo. Williams placed a crew on board the prize and sent her to Key West in charge of [[master's mate|Master's Mate]] Marcellus Jackson.

About half an hour before noon on 28 April, ''Annie'' sighted, chased, and fired upon ''Dream'' before that British schooner escaped into Spanish territorial waters off [[Cuba]]. This action prompted a protest by the English [[Master Mariner|master]] and added to the already large list of incidents that kept relations between the Federal Government and the [[United Kingdom]] tense throughout the Civil War.

=== Continued Florida operations ===

''Annie'' scored again while proceeding to [[Tampa Bay]] on 11 July when she took the whaleboat ''Alice'' and her crew of six—from [[Havana, Cuba]]—behind [[Cotteral's Key]]. Williams had been informed of the presence of the boat by the keeper of the Northwest Channel lighthouse who feared that she might attack his outpost. Another prize came ''Annie's'', way on the afternoon of 20 October when she captured the British schooner ''Martha Jane'', outward-bound from [[Bayport, Florida]], laden with cotton. Ten days later, ''Annie'' joined the armed launch of the screw gunboat {{USS|Sagamore|1861|6}}—which she was then tending—in chasing ''Meteor'' and caught that British schooner which was attempting to slip into [[Bayport, Florida]], with an assorted cargo from Havana. ''Annie'' and the launch again teamed up on 7 November when they took the British schooner ''Paul'' which—although cleared from Havana for Matamoras—was approaching the [[Florida]] coast with diverse merchandise.

=== Assigned as tender to ''Takoma'' and other Union ships ===

In the second half of February 1864, ''Annie'' left ''Sagamore'' and was attached to the screw gunboat ''Takoma''; and, thereafter, she acted as a tender to several other Union blockaders.

=== Blockade runner sets itself on fire, rather than be captured ===

On the morning of 2&amp;nbsp;March 1864, ''Annie'' anchored at 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., some five miles from land. Two hours later, a lookout reported having sighted a small boat approaching. At noon, the boat reversed course and fled, prompting the Union warship to give chase. Thirty minutes' sailing brought her within sight of ". . .a schooner inside the reefs" and toward which the boat was rowing. At 1:10&amp;nbsp;p.m., ''Annie'' ". . .anchored in 6 feet of water . . ." and sent an armed boat to board the schooner. However, the fleeing boat reached that vessel before the Yankee sailors boarded her, set her afire, and then hurried on shoreward. At 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., ''Annie's'' men went on board the schooner and found her to a new vessel of about 80&amp;nbsp;tons carrying an assorted cargo which included a large amount of [[ammunition]]. The rapid spread of the flames forced them to leave the prize which exploded about three minutes after their departure.

=== Stranger come alongside under a white flag of truce ===

Later that afternoon, a skiff flying a [[white flag]] came alongside ''Annie''. Its sole passenger, a man who ". . .identified himself as Allen A. Stephens. . ." and reported that he was one of a group of 20 men "about to rise against the rebel Government...and requested arms for his company." After promising Allen to report the incident, they allowed him to return to land, but no further mention of this man appears in the Official Record.

== ''Annie'' disappears, later is found sunk, crew lost ==

During the remainder of 1864, ''Annie'' continued to serve in the blockade of Florida's [[United States Gulf Coast|Gulf Coast]]. On 30 December 1864, she departed Key West and headed for [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]] on Florida′s west coast for further blockade duty. In January 1865, about two weeks after she left Key West, her hulk was found resting on the bottom in about six fathoms (36 feet; 11 meters) of water. She was a total wreck, apparently the victim of an explosion; and no trace of her crew was found.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3544">In ethics, a "'''universal code of ethics'''" is a system of ethics that can apply to every sentient being.

==History==
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] believed that what created the problem of ethical behavior is the duality of human nature. Since humans are both sensible and intellectual, and at the same time motivated by impulse, they must be guided by rules of conduct to balance the two. He believed that everyone could decide right or wrong based on the will behind the action, rather than the action itself. In deciding whether one's actions were moral, he said it should be considered what the universal benefit would be if everyone behaved in such a fashion. For example, if everyone stole, the result would be chaos and violence. Therefore, a moral person would consider it unethical to steal. In abiding by these laws, it is possible to see how a universal code of ethics could be built up.

However, men like [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] believed that there could be no universal code of ethics because all ethics and philosophy are relative to the economical situations of each individual society. Therefore, each society would create its own system of ethics based on its economic status and history, and the current system of ethics would soon give way to a new one. Thus all morals and ethics are relative.

Later codes of ethics, such as that of [[Max Stirner]], stated that the only ethics that existed were those that benefited the self. The common good and the love of one's fellow man, he claimed, were only illusory. Men who were exceptional in some way (intelligence or rank) were always the exception to moral standards. [[Nietzsche]] founded his ethical principles on this basis; he believed that everything powerful men did was defined as moral.&lt;ref name=phil&gt;[http://open-site.org/Society/Philosophy/Ethics/History History of Ethics].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universal ethics==
There are several ethical standards that are considered to be self-evident, and seem to apply to all people throughout all of history, regardless of cultural, political, social, or economic context.  The non-aggression principle, which prohibits aggression, or the initiation of force or violence against another person, is a universal ethical principle.  Examples of aggression include murder, rape, kidnapping, assault, robbery, theft, and vandalism.  On the other hand, the commission of any of such acts in response to aggression does not necessarily violate universal ethics.

==Reasons==
There are obvious reasons why universal ethics are beneficial to society.  For example, if people were allowed to kill or steal, this would lead to widespread chaos and violence, and would be detrimental to the well-being of society.  Most people agree that it's better to prohibit aggression than to allow everyone to commit it.  Therefore, aggression is intrinsically immoral. Although nearly all societies have laws prohibiting aggression, this does not mean that universal ethics are necessarily reflected by that society's government or its dominant ideology.

The '''Visitors''' are a fictional [[alien invasion|invading alien race]] from the [[V (franchise)|''V'' franchise]]. The "Visitors" are [[List of reptilian humanoids|reptilian humanoids]] who disguise themselves to look human but prefer to eat live prey, such as mice. In the 1983 and 1984 miniseries (but not the 1984 TV series) the disguised Visitors can be told apart from humans by a reverberating echo in their voices. The re-imagined 2009 versions lack that vocal attribute and thus appear more human. Since the Visitors of both versions are [[List of reptilian humanoids|reptilian]] in origin and nature, females reproduce by laying eggs after mating that eventually hatch into infant aliens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mondofox.it/2018/02/12/v-visitors-diventera-una-trilogia-cinematografica/|title=V - Visitors tornerà sotto forma di trilogia cinematografica|date=12 February 2018|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Visitors are given human names for the humans' convenience. They are never heard to use their home-world names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.writeups.org/v-tv-series-marc-singer-mike-donovan/|title=V TV series - Marc Singer - Mike Donovan - Character profile|date=26 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Leader==
'''The Leader''' (or commonly referred to by the Visitors as '''"Our Great Leader"''') is the head of a military dictatorship that controls the population on Sirius 4 and controls every resource and ship-of-the-line in the entire Sirian Fleet through its ministers. The Leader is constantly mentioned, but never seen; however, in the final episode, he actually has dialogue when we hear him (offscreen) speaking to Elizabeth. In most references to the Leader, the character is described as male, but the descriptions in ''The Second Generation'' refer to the Leader as a female entity.

==Supreme Commanders==

===John===
'''John''' ([[Richard Herd]]) is introduced in ''V''. 
The '''Supreme Commander''' of the fleet of Visitor ships. John is charismatic and likeable, evidently well-trained or well-prompted in public relations. He is the first Visitor that humans see, showing that they are just like humans. However, John is usually extremely busy touring the fleet attending to command issues, or reclusive when not needed to promote good will to the people of Earth. His appearance at the Los Angeles Medical Center on a worldwide broadcast to announce a cure for cancer is used by the [[Resistance (V TV series)|Resistance]] to unmask him and show the people of Earth that the Visitors have been deceiving them.
 
However it quickly becomes clear that John is something of a bureaucrat, enjoying the limelight and privileges that being a Supreme Commander brings but is considered by some (including Diana) to be "a fool who makes pretty speeches", while Diana organized the entire operation. John is later persuaded by [[#Pamela|Pamela]] to restrict [[#Diana|Diana]]'s command responsibilities. John is later killed by Diana when he refuses to carry out the Leader's order to destroy Earth when the Resistance routs the Visitors.

===Pamela===
'''Pamela''' ([[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]]) is introduced in ''V: The Final Battle''. She is the squadron commander and [[#Diana|Diana]]'s superior. She takes over command of the L.A. Mothership. Pamela's ship arrives at Earth a year into the occupation and begins a project to speed up acquisition of Earth's water. Pamela scorns Diana's claim of the leader's special favor, pointing out that Diana's "lover" sent Diana 56 trillion miles away. Diana kills Pamela after being ordered to work strictly in the scientific field.

===Charles===
'''Charles''' ([[Duncan Regehr]]) is introduced in ''V: The Series''. Sent by The Leader to take over military operations from [[#Diana|Diana]] and become the new Supreme Commander, Charles sets in motion the chain of events that lead to the death of [[Collaborators (V TV series)#Nathan Bates|Nathan Bates]]. Charles is a member of the House of Raman, a very powerful and influential family, possibly even royalty, he has the power to choose his own bride and marry her within twelve hours of the betrothal. He has a well-known reputation as a ladies man, appealing to all the women in the fleet, apart from Diana who resents him taking over her command. He is romantically attached to [[#Lydia|Lydia]], although he drops her in favor of Diana, whom he decides to marry in order to force her to return to the Homeworld, and bear his offspring, having become annoyed at her defiance. However, when he sees Diana naked in a ceremonial bath before their wedding, he decides that he would rather keep Diana around, Lydia attempts to poison her, but ends up killing Charles instead.

==Commanders==

===Diana===
'''Diana''' ([[Jane Badler]]) is introduced in ''V''. Sadistic, ruthless and brilliant, her ambition is matched only by her arrogance and cruelty. She is the second-in-command, as well as John's chief science officer of the fleet of 50 Visitor ships. She is commander of the mother ship over Los Angeles (although for the first few days after arrival, she is aboard the New York mother ship). In V, Diana is responsible for much of the Visitors attacks against the Resistance as well as ordering one of her lovers, Brian, to impregnate Robin Maxwell as part of an experiment. In V: The Final Battle, which takes place a year later, [[#Pamela|Pamela]], her squadron commander, arrives, reminding Diana of her inferior rank; Pamela decides to discredit Diana and remove her from any operational duties (it is implied they have a history). Diana later murders Pamela. It becomes clear that Diana is the real power behind the Visitors as she organises much or their events and attacks. She convinces Christine Walsh to become the Visitors spokesperson and later murders her when she pleas for the Resistance live on television, after John's real face is exposed and she has the loyalty and support of most of the fleet, except for Steven and Pamela who attempt to discredit her to advance their own agendas. At the end of the Final Battle when defeat is imminent, Diana chooses to destroy Earth rather than letting the Resistance claim victory, telling John he is a fool and angry at his bureaucracy. After murdering John she attempts to escape with Elizabeth, but ends up leaving by herself.

When V: The Series begins, it takes place straight after Diana escapes, where she is quickly captured by Mike Donovan and imprisoned for a year before she is due to stand trial for crimes against humanity. However, during protests outside her trial, she is seemingly shot dead and taken to a hospital. However it is later revealed her capture was organized by Nathan Bates, owner of a large scientific institution, who offers her a deal; life, food and shelter if she shares Visitor knowledge with him. However she quickly escapes and is able to contact the Visitor fleet, who have been hiding behind Earth's moon in preparation for a second invasion. Diana immediately takes command of the fleet from chief security officer Lydia and leads the second invasion against Earth.

As Chief Science Officer of the fleet, Diana is a pioneer of the conversion process, a brainwashing technique used to turn humans to aid the Visitors, although it is not always effective. She has inoculated the Visitors against all known Earth diseases and has developed a fool proof truth drug. [[#Steven|Steven]] and Pamela see her as "on edge" when feeling threatened, when Father Andrew shows her a bible, it makes Diana realise she has vulnerabilities, which she sees as a weakness, she responds by murdering the priest and destroying his bible. Her vengefulness is also displayed when she rejects [[#John|John]]'s pragmatic approach towards an impending defeat by murdering him.

Diana, also being stunningly beautiful has several lovers in V: The Original Miniseries, V: The Final Battle and V: The Series; she is seen as using her sexuality and feminine wiles to have her way with men in order to elevate her position. She was even involved with the Leader of the Visitors, prior to their arrival on Earth with Pamela suggesting that sex is "far too fragile a foundation" to handle Diana's ambition. Diana finds most of the men she is involved with disposable, killing one of them so she can blame him for misinforming the Leader and repeatedly reminding Lt. James she can find any other man to alleviate her boredom if he doesn't do as she commands. (In the V novels, it is said that Diana has an insatiable appetite for sex with humans - of both genders.)

In V: The Series, she was forced to marry [[#Charles|Charles]], whom she cannot bear for promoting Lydia ahead of her, before a botched assassination attempt by Lydia against Diana resulted in his death, for which Diana and Lydia framed [[#Marta|Marta]]. Diana is obsessed with capturing Elizabeth, or creating a new hybrid through cloning or other methods. She distrusts Lydia and tried several times to either kill Lydia or one of Lydia's close family members. When last seen, Diana has been placed under arrest by Philip, who does not know that Diana secretly planted a bomb on board the Leader's shuttle.

Diana is considered the main breakout character of all three series of V.

In August 2010, ABC confirmed that Jane Badler will play the character of Diana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/08/jane-badler-confirmed-as-annas-mother-on-v/ |title=Jane Badler Confirmed as Anna's Mother on V |publisher=TV Fanatic |date=2010-08-07 |accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later admitted that despite her prominence in the original series, she had to audition once more and eventually landed the part of Anna's mother, who has been locked up for 15 years because she believes that her mother's embrace of human emotion was a side effect of being "infected" by her human skin, and that such teachings represent a threat to her leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/12/exclusive-jane-badler-speaks-on-return-to-v/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: Jane Badler Speaks on Return to V |publisher=TV Fanatic |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first appearance in the new series was in the ending of the season-opener "Red Rain." In the series finale, "Mother's Day" Diana is killed by Anna after she is broken free from prison and tries to convince her people that the human soul is a gift.

===Lydia===
'''Lydia''' ([[June Chadwick]]) is introduced in ''V: The Series''. Blonde and English-accented, she is commander of the fleet when Diana isn't in charge.   
After the Visitor home world became a barren wasteland, Lydia, the fleet security officer at the time, was promoted by the Leader himself and ordered to lead the fleet to Earth to commence the second invasion. At the same time Diana escaped and immediately took command of the fleet causing some resentment.
She is as power-hungry as [[#Diana|Diana]], but far less sadistic. Lydia tends to inform on Diana's exploits to The Leader and overseers such as [[Fifth Column (V TV series)#Philip|Philip]] and [[#Charles|Charles]]. Lydia finds Diana belligerent and defiant, ignoring rules and procedure. Finally when she tortures Jacob, a pacifist man decorated by the Leader, Lydia decides to report Diana to the Leader personally, however Diana blows up her shuttle.

She survives the assassination attempt by Diana and comes back with Charles, a Supreme Commander who takes charge of the Invasion and Lydia becomes his adjutant. She later falls in love with Charles and experiences extreme jealousy when he decides to marry Diana. She fills Diana's cup with poison but to her dismay, Charles drinks the poison instead and Lydia only narrowly escapes, with Diana's assistance, of being convicted of killing him. She is forced to help Diana to frame [[#Marta|Marta]] for Charles' death.

Lydia's exact loyalties are unknown. She claims to serve only the Leader, however she also acts in her own best interests most likely to advance her own position or to get rid of Diana, however she lacks the cunning ruthlessness that Diana possesses. As Diana once told her, "I take charge of the situation and you wait for permission". Lydia is also an accomplished fighter, as she once defeated Diana in hand-to-hand combat. 
When the Leader declares an armistice, Lydia attempts to befriend the Resistance members and takes quite a delight in Diana's arrest.

==Officers==

===Brian===
'''Brian''' ([[Peter Nelson (actor)|Peter Nelson]]) is introduced in ''V''. A young Visitor officer who becomes a leader of the Friends of the Visitors youth corps. As [[Collaborators (V TV series)#Daniel Bernstein|Daniel Bernstein]] continues to prove his devotion and loyalty, he becomes Brian's second-in-command. 
Brian befriends [[Resistance (V TV series)#Robin Maxwell|Robin Maxwell]], and when she becomes a prisoner on the mother ship. [[#Diana|Diana]] enlists him in an experiment in inter-species reproduction. Daniel is set up to be seen by the Visitors as Brian's betrayer when Brian is captured and used as a test subject for the red dust. As he tries to manipulate Robin into setting him free by trying to appeal to her "love" for him, a vengeful Robin uses the Red Dust on Brian right after showing Brian their child, [[Resistance (V TV series)#Elizabeth Maxwell|Elizabeth]].

===Jake===
'''Jake''' ([[Stack Pierce]]) is introduced in ''V''. He has the rank of Captain and the outward appearance of an African-American man. His unit captures both [[Resistance (V TV series)#Robin Maxwell|Robin]] and [[Resistance (V TV series)#Maxwell family|Robert Maxwell]] when they emerge from the downtown [[Resistance (V TV series)|Resistance]] hideaway after curfew. He extracts the location of the mountain camp from Robert, but betrays Robert by leading an attack on the camp anyway, with [[#Diana|Diana]] riding along. Jake is still serving in Diana’s command a year later.

===James===
'''James''' ([[Judson Scott]]) is introduced in ''V: The Series''. Lieutenant James is an opportunistic soldier and one of Diana's lovers. He is assigned to capture and destroy [[Resistance (V TV series)|Resistance]] fighters no matter what the cost. He is loyal to Diana (though still always in fear of his life). He arranges an unsuccessful assassination attempt on The Leader and is last seen in custody alongside Diana.

===Steven===
'''Steven''' ([[Andrew Prine]]) is introduced in ''V''. He is the security chief on board [[#Diana|Diana]]'s ship in Los Angeles. He establishes a relationship with [[Collaborators (V TV series)#Eleanor Dupres|Eleanor Dupres]] that he puts to use by bringing her into the fold as a collaborator and obtains information he feels is useful to his job.
He engages in a power struggle with Diana. They differ in how they wish to handle the unexpected resilience of the [[Resistance (V TV series)|Resistance]]. Steven apparently kills Eleanor when she attempts to flee the Visitor embassy and he is killed by [[Resistance (V TV series)#Ham Tyler|Ham Tyler]] - who dumps a mass of red dust on Steven's face and leaves him to die.

===Martin===
'''Martin''' ([[Frank Ashmore]]) is a shuttle pilot who befriends Mike Donovan and his son, Sean. After the Visitors begin their reign of terror and Donovan is captured, Martin helps him escape. After Sean and his ex-wife Marjorie go missing — along with the majority of the townspeople — he goes up to the mothership again and confronts Martin about what the Visitors are really up to. He confesses that they've been stealing Earth's water supply, and that both Sean and Marjorie are alive. Unfortunately, he adds, they are being kept in suspended animation because, in addition to water, their planet also has another major shortage — food. Martin is opposed to the Leader's plans, but is afraid to offer Donovan any more than ancillary support, as the Fifth Column is not strong enough to exist openly. Much later, the Visitors use Sean to trade for Donovan. Once aboard Diana's mothership, she immediately tests out her new truth serum on him. Unable to resist, Donovan unwillingly names Martin as the head of the Fifth Column aboard her vessel. Martin manages to kill Diana's guard, but she gets away. With nowhere left to turn, he follows Donovan back to Earth where he joins other members of the Fifth column. Following the end of the war and Diana's capture, Martin becomes Donovan's cameraman. However, his sense of outrage that Diana will be tried at [[International Court of Justice|the Hague]] instead of executed outright gets the better of him, and he tracks her down, hoping to do the job himself. Unfortunately, Diana mortally wounds him, escaping with his last Red Dust pill and setting her jail on fire. Donovan arrives too late to save his friend.

===Phillip===
'''Inspector General Phillip''' ([[Frank Ashmore]]) was introduced in the second half of ''V: The Series''. He came to investigate Lydia's reports of Diana's behavior and to find Mike Donovan, the man who supposedly murdered his twin brother, Martin. However, after confronting Donovan, he discovers that it was Diana who was Martin's killer. Eventually, he becomes friends with Donovan as well, and becomes a valuable ally of the Resistance.

(It is never explained how Phillip is immediately recognizable as Martin's brother, as both characters are always seen wearing their human disguises.)

==Cadets==

===Angela===
'''Angela''' ([[Leslie Bevis]]) is introduced in ''V: The Series''. A Visitor cadet, she killed another cadet during combat training and was dismissed by [[Fifth Column (V TV series)#Known members|Philip]] for her sadism, thus preventing her from becoming an officer. [[#Diana|Diana]] plays on Angela's resentment, assigning her as Philip's bodyguard on an assignment to capture [[Resistance (V TV series)#Mike Donovan|Mike Donovan]] as part of her plan to have Philip killed. Angela is stopped from killing Philip when she is shot dead by [[Fifth Column (V TV series)#Glenda &amp; Robert|Glenda]].

===Daniel===
'''Daniel''' ([[Robert Thaler]]) is introduced in ''V: The Series''. He is a young officer who becomes Diana's lover. After the failure of one of her exploits, Diana kills him "because someone has to take the blame".

Due to the episodes being aired out of order, the episode in which Daniel dies aired ''before'' the episode in which he was introduced.

===John Langley===
'''John Langley''' ([[Bruce Davison]]) is introduced in ''V: The Series''. He is the undercover agent assigned to infiltrate the [[Resistance (V TV series)|Resistance]] and impregnate [[Resistance (V TV series)#Robin Maxwell|Robin Maxwell]] in hopes of creating a second Star Child, but he is killed by a Fifth Columnist before he can finish his mission.

===Marta===
'''Marta''' ([[Gela Nash]]) is introduced in ''V: The Series''. She is the mother ship's [[pharmacist]]. She provided [[#Lydia|Lydia]] with the cat poison Lydia tried to use to kill Diana, but which killed [[#Charles|Charles]]. Diana despises her and, with Lydia's reluctant assistance, frames her for [[#Charles|Charles]]' murder. Marta is sentenced to be shot into space for eternity alongside Charles' decaying corpse in a space crypt. Diana orders [[#Oswald|Oswald]] to ensure that Marta is alive and conscious ("if she stops breathing so do you"); Marta wakes up next to the corpse just before the crypt leaves the ceremony site.

===Nigel===
'''Nigel''' ([[Ken Olandt]]) is introduced in ''V: The Series''. [[#Lydia|Lydia]]'s brother, he is brought to the Los Angeles Mothership as part of a scheme by [[#Diana|Diana]], who intends to have him sacrificed at a Visitor ceremony, but is thwarted by his sister and [[Fifth Column (V TV series)#Known members|Philip]].

===Oswald===
'''Oswald''' ([[Peter Elbling]]) is introduced in ''V: The Series''. An underling of Diana, he is a [[mortician]] and an interior decorator. Diana had him "procure" several sexual partners for her pleasure (a job which he enjoyed immensely). He is very flamboyant and very openly homosexual but steered clear of what he considered stereotypical gay behavior such as "bathousing and barbarism", though this did not stop him from indulging in his taste for sexual pleasures in much the same manner as Diana. He favored human partners, as well as a host of unknown male Visitors, considering sex a type of art to be practiced.

===Willie===
'''Willie''' ([[Robert Englund]]) was introduced in the first miniseries. He was a worker assigned to Arthur Dupres' chemical plant in Los Angeles. At first he had trouble adjusting to his new assignment (according to the novelization, his original name was Ahmed) and he had originally learned Arabic because he had been assigned to Saudi Arabia, and his human supervisor, Caleb Taylor, disliked him immensely. That changed once Willie rescued him after a liquid hydrogen pipe burst. Willie befriended a human, Harmony Moore, who helped him learn English. Unfortunately, she was killed during the Resistance's assault on Diana's ship. Following the end of the war, Willie settled down and worked as a waiter at Elias Taylor's restaurant, Club Creole, and served as mentor to Elizabeth Maxwell, the Starchild.

==Visitors aboard other motherships==

===Mary Kruger===
'''Mary''' ([[Sybil Danning]]) is introduced in ''V: The Series''. A Dallas-based Visitor, Mary attends a convention in Los Angeles to display the Encapsulator, a device of her own invention that will revolutionize the way in which humans are harvested for food. The resistance succeeds in blowing up the house in which the convention is being held, destroying the Encapsulator. Mary is killed in the explosion.

==2009 version==
In the [[V (2009 TV series)|2009 reimagining of ''V'']], the Visitors actually infiltrated governments around the world prior to their official appearance, and instigated most of the wars in the late 20th century to make them appear as saviors to humanity. Their technology has also advanced to the point of allowing them to simultaneously telecast to the entire world via the motherships in every known Earth language. Unlike the original series, in which the Visitors' human "skin" was a latex-like material that could be easily ripped off without much pain, these Visitors seem to wear literal skin which can only be damaged or removed forcefully and painfully.  Indeed, they have a high threshold for pain, and the only effective way to torture them is to skin them, which is ultimately lethal. They also practice [[sexual cannibalism]] as seen in Anna's case. The Visitors' reproductive ability of egg-laying is retained in this series, although the egg sacks laid by Anna appear more womb-like, gestating in liquid substances than those having shells like normal reptiles.

* '''Anna''' ([[Morena Baccarin]]) is the Supreme Commander and Queen of the Visitors, an amalgam of the Diana, John, and "Leader" characters from the original series.  She is intent on maintaining the Visitors' positive public image by any means. Anna appears to be the leader of the Visitor race as a whole (she is referred to by her own people as "the queen"). She maintains control of the Visitors by means of some sort of psychic projection called "bliss", which seems to project the following when needed: a sense of euphoria, a calming effect whenever worry is prevalent, and generally seems to keep the Vs in line. Fifth Columnists and other Visitors who exhibit human emotion seem resistant to her bliss. Anna regards human emotions as an aberration that must be purged from the Visitors, and is shocked when she begins to exhibit them herself. For this same reason, she has imprisoned her mother Diana ([[Jane Badler]]) in the bowels of her mothership for over 15 years. She also engages in sexual cannibalism when she mates with her subjects, whom are obligated to remain still as she lies atop them carrying out the act for them, much to their torment. In the final episode of the series, "Mother's Day", she kills Diana and banishes Lisa to her grandmother's prison for assisting her in her failed coup attempt. Also, for reasons unknown, she laid the last queen egg that later hatched into the Lisa clone that mated and killed Tyler. ([[Visitors (V science fiction franchise)#Lisa|see above]])
*'''Marcus''' ([[Christopher Shyer]]) is Anna's second-in-command. He often expresses dissatisfaction with some Anna's more draconian methods, but otherwise appears totally loyal. In the season one finale he revives Joshua, a Fifth Column member, leaving his loyalty apparently unknown, but it is then revealed that Joshua is revived to investigate who are his Fifth Column Partners. In season two, it is revealed that Marcus is loyal to Diana and he helps stage the coup d'état on Anna. After its failure, he reveals to Anna his betrayal and Anna forgives him.
*'''Joshua''' ([[Mark Hildreth (actor)|Mark Hildreth]]) is Anna's chief medical advisor and head of the medical staff. He appears loyal to Anna at first but is soon revealed to be [[Fifth Column (V TV series)|Fifth Column]] when he kills Dale Maddox; a V sleeper agent who was almost killed by Erica. Joshua later aids the Fifth Column on the ground via a communication device previously owned by John May, he provides key intel to Ryan and the others thanks to his close position to Anna. In the season 1 finale he is forced to reveal his allegiance in order to create a distraction for Erica to destroy Anna's eggs. He then allows Erica to kill him so she is not revealed as Fifth Column also. He is revived by Marcus in the closing minutes of Season 1. After being revived, his memory is wiped and he again appears loyal to Anna. However, after seeing Lisa sneaking around the mothership with Blue Energy, his memory returns and again he turns to the Fifth Column.
* '''Lisa''' ([[Laura Vandervoort]]) is a young Visitor who is Anna's daughter, serving as officer in the Peace Ambassador Program which Tyler Evans joins after meeting her. Over the course of several episodes, her relationship with Tyler develops to the point where she begins experiencing human emotion and developing sympathies towards the Fifth Column. She is imprisoned after assisting her grandmother Diana in a failed coup attempt, while her clone mates with and devours Tyler.
* '''Dale Maddox''' ([[Alan Tudyk]]) is a Visitor sleeper agent who poses as a [[FBI]] investigator working alongside Erica Evans. As a result, whenever she comes too close to Visitor activity, Dale contacts them to remove any trace. However, Erica learns the truth as she appears to have killed Dale during an assault on an anti-Visitor meeting in the pilot episode. Dale survives but is killed by the New York mothership's chief medical officer Joshua ([[Mark Hildreth (actor)|Mark Hildreth]]), who is actually a Fifth Column agent.

'''Wallace Fitzgerald Beery''' (April 1, 1885 – April 15, 1949) was an American film actor.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', April 20, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his portrayal of Bill in ''[[Min and Bill]]'' (1930) opposite [[Marie Dressler]], as [[Long John Silver]] in ''[[Treasure Island (1934 film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1934), as [[Pancho Villa]] in ''[[Viva Villa!]]'' (1934), and his titular role in ''[[The Champ (1931 film)|The Champ]]'' (1931), for which he won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. Beery appeared in some 250 films during a 36-year career. His contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] stipulated in 1932 that he would be paid $1 more than any other contract player at the studio, making him the highest-paid actor in the world. He was the brother of actor [[Noah Beery Sr.]] and uncle of actor [[Noah Beery Jr.]]

For his contributions to the film industry, Beery was posthumously inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] with a motion pictures star in 1960. His star is located at 7001 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].&lt;ref name=hwof&gt;[http://www.walkoffame.com/wallace-beery Walk of Fame Stars-Wallace Beery]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Beery was born the youngest of three boys in 1885 in [[Clay County, Missouri]], near [[Smithville, Missouri|Smithville]].&lt;ref name="Missouri Biography 1999"&gt;''Dictionary of Missouri Biography'', Lawrence O. Christensen, University of Missouri Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The Beery family left the farm in the 1890s and moved to nearby [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where the father was a police officer.

Wallace Beery attended the Chase School in Kansas City and took piano lessons as well, but showed little love for academic matters. He ran away from home twice, the first time returning after a short time, quitting school and working in the Kansas City [[Classification yard|train yards]] as an [[Wiper (occupation)|engine wiper]].&lt;ref name="Missouri Biography 1999"/&gt; Beery ran away from home a second time at age 16, and joined the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus|Ringling Brothers Circus]] as an assistant [[elephant]] trainer. He left two years later, after being clawed by a [[leopard]].

He did some comedies for [[Mack Sennett]], ''[[Maggie's First False Step]]'' (1917) and ''[[Teddy at the Throttle]]'' (1917), but he would gradually leave that genre and specialize in portrayals of villains prior to becoming a major leading man during the sound era.

===Villainous Roles===
In 1917 Beery portrayed [[Pancho Villa]] in ''[[Patria (1917 film)|Patria]]'' at a time when Villa was still active in [[Mexico]]. (Beery reprised the role 17 years later in ''[[Viva Villa!]]''.)

===Historical Films===
Beery had a large then-rare heroic part as [[King Richard I]] (Richard the Lion-Hearted) in ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (1922), starring [[Douglas Fairbanks]] in the titular role.

Beery starred in an action melodrama, ''[[Stormswept]]'' (1923) for [[FBO Films]] alongside his elder brother, [[Noah Beery Sr.]]. The tagline on the movie's posters was "Wallace and Noah Beery - The Two Greatest Character Actors on the American Screen."

Beery played his third royal, the [[Duc de Tours]], in ''[[Ashes of Vengeance]]'' (1923) with [[Norma Talmadge]], then did ''[[Drifting (1923 film)|Drifting]]'' (1923) with [[Priscilla Dean]] for director Browning.

Beery had the titular role in ''[[Bavu]]'' (1923), about [[Bolsheviks]] and the [[Russian Revolution]]. He co-starred with [[Buster Keaton]] in the comedy ''[[Three Ages]]'' (1923), the first feature Keaton wrote, produced, directed and starred in.

Beery was a villain in ''[[The Eternal Struggle (film)|The Eternal Struggle]]'' (1923), a Mountie drama, which was produced by [[Louis B. Mayer]], who would eventually become crucial to Beery's career. He was reunited with Dean and Browning in ''[[White Tiger (1923 film)|White Tiger]]'' (1923), then played the title role in the aforementioned ''[[Richard the Lion-Hearted (1923 film)|Richard the Lion-Hearted]]'' (1923), a sequel to ''Robin Hood'' based on [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Talisman (Scott novel)|The Talisman]]''.

===Paramount===
Beery signed a contract with Paramount Pictures. He had a support role in ''[[Adventure (1925 film)|Adventure]]'' (1925) directed by [[Victor Fleming]].

At First National, he was given the star role of [[Professor Challenger]] in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s dinosaur epic ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925), arguably his silent performance most frequently screened in the modern era. Beery was top billed in Paramount's ''[[The Devil's Cargo]]'' (1925) for Victor Fleming, and supported in ''[[The Night Club]]'' (1925), ''[[The Pony Express (1925 film)|The Pony Express]]'' (1925) for [[James Cruze]], and ''[[The Wanderer (1925 film)|The Wanderer]]'' (1925) for [[Raoul Walsh]].

Beery starred in a comedy with [[Raymond Hatton]], ''[[Behind the Front (film)|Behind the Front]]'' (1926) and he was a villain in ''[[Volcano! (1926 film)|Volcano!]]'' (1926). He was a bos'n in ''[[Old Ironsides (film)|Old Ironsides]]'' (1926) for director James Cruze, with [[Charles Farrell]] in the romantic lead.

Beery had the title role in the baseball movie ''[[Casey at the Bat (film)|Casey at the Bat]]'' (1927). He was reunited with Hatton in ''[[Fireman, Save My Child (1927 film)|Fireman, Save My Child]]'' (1927) and ''[[Now We're in the Air]]'' (1927). The latter also featured [[Louise Brooks]] who was Beery's co star in ''[[Beggars of Life]]'' (1928), directed by [[William Wellman]], which was Paramount's first part-talkie movie.

There was a fourth comedy with Hatton, ''[[Wife Savers]]'' (1929), then Beery starred in ''[[Chinatown Nights (1929 film)|Chinatown Nights]]'' (1929) for Wellman, produced by a young [[David O. Selznick]]. This film was shot silent with the voices dubbed in by the actors afterward, which worked spectacularly well with Beery's resonant voice, although the technique was not used again during the silent era for another full-length feature. Beery then played in ''[[Stairs of Sand]]'' (1929) before being fired by Paramount.

[[Irving Thalberg]] signed Beery to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] as a character actor. The association began well when Beery played the savage convict "Butch," a role originally intended for [[Lon Chaney Sr.]] (who died that same year), in the highly successful 1930 prison film ''[[The Big House (1930 film)|The Big House]]'', directed by [[George W. Hill]]; Beery was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].

Beery's second film for MGM was also a huge success: ''[[Billy the Kid (1930 film)|Billy the Kid]]'' (1930), an early [[widescreen]] picture in which he played [[Pat Garrett]]. He supported [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] in ''[[Way for a Sailor]]'' (1930) and [[Grace Moore]] in ''[[A Lady's Morals]]'' (1930), portraying [[P.T. Barnum]] in the latter.

===Stardom===
Beery was well established as a leading man and top rank character actor. What really made him one of the cinema's foremost stars was ''[[Min and Bill]]'' (1931) opposite [[Marie Dressler]] and directed by [[George W. Hill]], a sensational success.&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;Scott Eyman, ''Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B. Mayer'', Robson, 2005, p. 191 {{ISBN|9781861058928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beery made a third film with Hill, ''[[The Secret Six]]'' (1931), a gangster movie with [[Jean Harlow]] and [[Clark Gable]] in key supporting roles. The picture was popular but was surpassed at the box office by ''[[The Champ (1931 film)|The Champ]]'', which Beery made with [[Jackie Cooper]] for director [[King Vidor]]. The film, especially written for Beery, was another box office sensation. Beery shared the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] with [[Fredric March]].  Though March received one vote more than Beery, Academy rules at the time—since rescinded—defined results within one vote of each other as "ties".&lt;ref&gt;History of the Academy Awards: The Fifth Academy Awards, 1931/32. [http://history1900s.about.com/od/fadsfashion/a/1931awards.htm About.com archive]. Retrieved April 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beery's career went from strength to strength. ''[[Hell Divers]]'' (1932), a naval airplane epic also starring a young [[Clark Gable]] billed under Beery, was a big hit. So too was the all-star ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932), in which Beery was billed fourth, under [[Greta Garbo]], [[John Barrymore]], and [[Joan Crawford]], one of the very few times he would not be top billed for the rest of his career. In 1932 his contract with MGM stipulated that he be paid a dollar more than any other contract player at the studio, making him the world's highest-paid actor.

Beery was a German wrestler in ''[[Flesh (1932 film)|Flesh]]'' (1932), a hit directed by [[John Ford]] but Ford removed his directorial credit before the film opened, so the picture screened with no director listed despite being labeled "A John Ford Production" in the opening title card. Next Beery was in another all-star ensemble blockbuster, ''[[Dinner at Eight (film)|Dinner at Eight]]'' (1933), with Jean Harlow holding her own as Beery's comically bickering wife. This time Beery was billed third, under [[Marie Dressler]] and [[John Barrymore]].

Beery was loaned out to the new [[Twentieth Century Pictures]] for the boisterously fast-paced comedy/drama ''[[The Bowery (film)|The Bowery]]'' (1933), also starring [[George Raft]], Jackie Cooper and [[Fay Wray]], and featuring [[Pert Kelton]], under the direction of [[Raoul Walsh]]. The picture was a smash hit.

Back at MGM he played the title role of [[Pancho Villa]] in ''[[Viva Villa!]]'' (1933) and was reunited with Dressler in ''[[Tugboat Annie]]'' (1933), a massive hit. He was [[Long John Silver]] in ''[[Treasure Island (1934 film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1934), described as a box office "disappointment"&lt;ref&gt;THE YEAR IN HOLLYWOOD: 1984 May Be Remembered as the Beginning of the Sweetness-and-Light Era
By DOUGLAS W. CHURCHILL.HOLLYWOOD.. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 30 Dec 1934: X5.&lt;/ref&gt; despite being MGM's third largest hit of the season, and remains currently viewed as featuring one of Beery's iconic performances.

Beery returned to Twentieth Century Productions for ''[[The Mighty Barnum]]'' (1934) in which he played [[P.T. Barnum]] again. Back at MGM he was a kindly sergeant in ''[[West Point of the Air]]'' (1935) and was in an all-star spectacular, ''[[China Seas (film)|China Seas]]'' (1935), this time billed beneath Clark Gable.

''[[O'Shaughnessy's Boy]]'' (1935) reunited Beery and Jackie Cooper. He had the lead as the drunken uncle in MGM's adaptation of ''[[Ah, Wilderness! (film)|Ah, Wilderness!]]'' (1936) and went back to Twentieth Century - now [[20th Century Fox]] - for ''[[A Message to Garcia (1936 film)|A Message to Garcia]]'' (1936).

At MGM he was in ''[[Old Hutch]]'' (1936) and ''[[The Good Old Soak]]'' (1937) then he was back at Fox for ''[[Slave Ship (1937 film)|Slave Ship]]'' (1937), taking second billing under [[Warner Baxter]], a rarity for Beery after ''Min and Bill'' catapulted his career into the strastosphere in 1931, during which he received top billing in all but six films (''Min and Bill'', ''Grand Hotel'', ''Tugboat Annie'', ''Dinner at Eight'', ''China Seas'' and ''Slave Ship'').

===Decline===
The status of Beery's films went into a decline, possibly due to a scandal in which Beery was implicated in the death of [[Ted Healy]], which was apparently kept out of the newspapers by the studio's "fixer" [[Eddie Mannix]], who eventually became head of MGM. After an abrupt European vacation, Beery was in ''[[The Bad Man of Brimstone]]'' (1938) with [[Dennis O'Keefe]] (and Noah Beery Sr. in a cameo role as a bartender), ''[[Port of Seven Seas]]'' (1938) with [[Maureen O'Sullivan]], ''[[Stablemates]]'' (1938) with [[Mickey Rooney]], ''[[Stand Up and Fight (film)|Stand Up and Fight]]'' (1939) with [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], ''[[Sergeant Madden]]'' (1939) with [[Tom Brown (actor)|Tom Brown]], ''[[Thunder Afloat]]'' (1939) with [[Chester Morris]], ''[[The Man from Dakota]]'' (1940) with [[Delores del Rio]], and ''[[20 Mule Team]]'' (1940) with [[Marjorie Rambeau]], [[Anne Baxter]] and [[Noah Beery Jr.]], enjoying top billing in all of them.

''[[Wyoming (1940 film)|Wyoming]]'' (1940) teamed Beery with [[Marjorie Main]]. After ''[[The Bad Man (1941 film)|The Bad Man]]'' (1941), which also stars [[Lionel Barrymore]] and future US president [[Ronald Reagan]], and was the remake of a [[Walter Huston]] picture, MGM reunited Beery and Main in ''[[Barnacle Bill (1941 film)|Barnacle Bill]]'' (1941), ''[[The Bugle Sounds]]'' (1941), and ''[[Jackass Mail]]'' (1942).

Beery did a war film, ''[[Salute to the Marines]]'' (1943) then was back with Main in ''[[Rationing (film)|Rationing]]'' (1944). ''[[Barbary Coast Gent]]'' (1944), a broad Western comedy in which Beery played a bombastic con man, teamed him with [[Binnie Barnes]]. He did another war film, ''[[This Man's Navy]]'' (1945), then made another Western with Main, ''[[Bad Bascomb (film)|Bad Bascomb]]'' (1946), a huge hit, helped by [[Margaret O'Brien]]'s casting.

''[[The Mighty McGurk]]'' (1947) put Beery with another child star of the studio, [[Dean Stockwell]]. ''[[Alias a Gentleman]]'' (1947) was the first of Beery's movies to lose money during the sound era. Beery received top billing for ''[[A Date with Judy (film)|A Date with Judy]]'' (1949), a hugely popular musical featuring [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. Beery's last film, again featuring Main, ''[[Big Jack (film)|Big Jack]]'' (1949), also lost money according to Mannix's reckoning.&lt;ref name="Mannix"&gt;{{Citation | title = The Eddie Mannix Ledger | publisher = Margaret Herrick Library, Center for Motion Picture Study | place = Los Angeles}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First marriage ===
On March 27, 1916, at the age of {{age|1885|04|01|1916|02|20}}, Beery married {{age|1899|03|27|1916|03|27}}-year-old actress [[Gloria Swanson]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gloria Swanson: The Ultimate Star|last=Shearer|first=Stephen Michael|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|year=2013|isbn=9781250013668|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two had co-starred in ''[[Sweedie Goes to College]].''&lt;ref name="Sonneborn 2002" /&gt;  Although Beery had enjoyed popularity with his ''Sweedie'' shorts, his career had taken a dip, and during the marriage to Swanson, he relied on her as a breadwinner.  According to Swanson's autobiography, Beery raped her on their wedding night, and later tricked her into swallowing an [[abortifacient]] when she was pregnant, which caused her to lose their child.&lt;ref name="Swanson on Swanson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Swanson|first=Gloria|title=Swanson on Swanson|year=1980|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-394-50662-6|pages=69–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swanson filed for divorce in 1917 and it was finalized in 1918.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Second marriage and adoption ===
On August 4, 1924, Beery married actress Rita Gilman ''(née'' Mary Areta Gilman; 1898–1986) in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VnGeCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=wallace%20beery%20rita%20gilman%20married&amp;pg=PA21|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Silent Film Western Actors and Actresses|last=Katchmer|first=George A.|date=2002-05-08|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476609058|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple adopted Carol Ann Priester (1930–2013), daughter of Rita Beery's mother's half-sister, Juanita Priester ''(née'' Caplinger; 1899–1931) and her husband, Erwin William Priester (1897–1969).  After {{age|1924|08|04|1939|05|01}} years of marriage, Rita filed for divorce on May 1, 1939, in [[Carson City]], [[Ormsby County]], [[Nevada]].  Within 20 minutes of filing, she won the decree.  Rita remarried 15 days later, on May 16, 1939, to Jessen Albert D. Foyt (1907–1945), filing her marriage license with the same county clerk in Carson City.

=== Alleged fatal altercation ===
In December 1937, comedic actor [[Ted Healy]] was involved in a drunken altercation at [[Cafe Trocadero]] on the [[Sunset Strip]]. E. J. Fleming, in his 2005 book, ''The Fixers: [[Eddie Mannix]], [[Howard Strickling]] and the MGM Publicity Machine'', asserts that Healy was attacked by three men:
&lt;ol type="i" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future James Bond producer [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert "Cubby" Broccoli]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local mob figure [[Pat DiCicco]] (who was Broccoli’s cousin as well as the former husband of [[Thelma Todd]] and the future husband of [[Gloria Vanderbilt]])&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wallace Beery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Fleming writes that this beating led to Healy's death a few days later.&lt;ref name="Fleming 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChicagoTribune 2002 Apr 4" /&gt;

=== Second adoption ===
Around December 1939, Beery, recently divorced, adopted a seven-month-old girl, Phyllis Ann Beery.&lt;ref name="Time 1939 Dec 4"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762973,00.html "Milestones,"] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]],'' December 4, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; Phyllis appeared in MGM publicity photos when adopted, but was never mentioned again.&lt;ref&gt;A Certain Cinema, [http://acertaincinema.com/media-tags/phyllis-ann-beery/ Acertaincinema.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Beery told the press he had taken the girl in from a single mother, recently divorced, but he had filed no official adoption papers.&lt;ref name="PalmBeachPost 1939 Dec 8"&gt;"Beery Will Add To Adopted Family" ([[United Press|UP]]), ''[[Palm Beach Post]]'', December 8, 1939, p. 22 (accessible ''via'' [[Newspapers.com]] at {{URL|https://www.newspapers.com/image/130165198}})&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working relationship with peers ===
Beery was considered {{lang|en|[[wikt:misanthropic|misanthropic]]}} and difficult to work with by many of his colleagues. [[Mickey Rooney]], one of Beery's few co-stars to consistently speak highly of him in subsequent decades, related in his autobiography that [[Howard Strickling]], MGM's head of publicity, once went to [[Louis B. Mayer]] to complain that Beery was stealing props from the studio's sets.  "And that wasn't all," Rooney continued.  "He went on for some minutes about the trouble that Beery was always causing him ... Mayer sighed and said, 'Yes, Howard, Beery's a son of a bitch.  But he's ''our'' son of a bitch.'  Strickling got the point.  A family has to be tolerant of its black sheep, particularly if they brought a lot of money into the family fold, which Beery certainly did."&lt;ref&gt;Rooney, M. ''Life is Too Short''. Villard Books (1991), p. 77. {{ISBN|0679401954}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Child actors, in particular, recalled unpleasant encounters with Beery.  [[Jackie Cooper]], who made several films with him early in his career, called him "a big disappointment", and accused him of upstaging, and other attempts to undermine his performances, out of what Cooper presumed was jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Jackie.  ''Please Don't Shoot My Dog''.  Morrow, 1980, pp. 54–61.  {{ISBN|0-688-03659-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He recalled impulsively throwing his arms around Beery after one especially heartfelt scene, only to be gruffly pushed away.&lt;ref&gt;Bergan, R (May 5, 2011). Jackie Cooper Obituary. [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/05/jackie-cooper-obituary ''The Guardian'' archive]. Retrieved August 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Child actress [[Margaret O'Brien]] claimed that she had to be protected by crew members from Beery's insistence on constantly pinching her.&lt;ref&gt;Private Screenings: Child Stars|date=March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooney remained an exception to the general negative attitude among child actors.  In his memoir he described Beery as "... a lovable, shambling kind of guy who never seemed to know that his shirttail belonged inside his pants, but always knew when a little kid actor needed a smile and a wink or a word of encouragement." He did concede that "not everyone loved [Beery] as much as I did."&lt;ref&gt;Rooney, M. ''Life is Too Short''. Villard Books (1991), pp. 76–7. {{ISBN|0679401954}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beery, by contrast, described Rooney as a "brat", but a "fine actor".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, A. ''The Nine Lives of Mickey Rooney''. Stein and Day (1986), p. 68. {{ISBN|0812830563}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hobbies ===
Beery owned and flew his own planes,&lt;ref name="Davis-Monthan-Air-Field"&gt;[https://dmairfield.com/people/beery_wa/ "Wallace Beery,"] ({{URL|www.Dmairfield.com}})&lt;/ref&gt; one a [[Howard DGA-11]]. On April 15, 1933 he was commissioned a Lieutenant Commander in the [[United States Navy Reserve]] at [[Long Beach Airport|NRAB Long Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;Heiser, Wayne H., "U.S. Naval and Marine Corps Reserve Aviation V. I, 1916–1942." p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of his proudest achievements was catching the largest [[black sea bass]] in the world — {{convert|515|lb|kg}} — off [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]] in 1916, a record that stood for 35 years.&lt;ref name="NewsLeader 1977 Dec 18"&gt;"Quite a Record," ''[[The News Leader]]'', December 18, 1977, p. 13 (accessible ''via'' [[Newspapers.com]] at {{URL|https://www.newspapers.com/image/288602242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activism against National Park Lands ===
A noteworthy episode in Beery's life is chronicled in the fifth episode of [[Ken Burns]]' documentary ''[[The National Parks: America's Best Idea]]'':  In 1943, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed an executive order creating [[Grand Teton National Park|Jackson Hole National Monument]] to protect the land adjoining the Grand Tetons in Wyoming.  Local ranchers, outraged at the loss of grazing lands, compared FDR's action to Hitler's taking of Austria.  Led by an aging Beery, they protested by herding 500 cattle across the monument lands without a permit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/nationalparks/history/ep5/6/ Episode Five: 1933–1945 Great Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paternity suit ===
On February 13, 1948, Gloria Schumm ''(aka'' Gloria Smith Beery, ''née'' Florence W. Smith; 1916–1989) filed a paternity suit against Beery. Beery, through his lawyer, Norman Ronald Tyre (1910–2002), initially offered $6,000 as a settlement, but denied being the father.  Gloria had given birth on February 7, 1948, to Johan Richard Wallace Schumm.  Gloria, in 1924, divorced Stuttgart-born Hollywood actor [[Hans Schumm]] ''(né'' Johann Josef Eugen Schumm; 1896–1990), but remarried him August 21, 1947, after realizing that she was pregnant.  Prior to remarrying [[Hans Schumm]], Gloria, on August 4, 1947, met with Beery at his home, where he gave her the name and address of a physician to submit an examination.&lt;ref name="Long-Beach-Independent 1948 Apr 29" /&gt;  At or around that time, she also asked Beery to marry her to ''legitimatize the expected child'' (her words), which Beery refused.

According to newspapers, Gloria claimed to have been intimate with Wallace Beery on or about May 1, 1947, at his home in [[Beverly Hills]] (in the court proceedings, however, she claimed to have been intimate with Beery on May 17, 1947).  Beery conceded that he had known Gloria for about 15 years and that, under the pseudonym "Gloria Whitney," she had played [[bit role]]s in 6 films that he starred in.  She again separated from [[Hans Schumm]] April 15, 1948.

=== Death, estate, and continuing paternity suit ===
[[File:Wallace Beery Grave.JPG|thumb|150px|Grave at Forest Lawn Glendale]]
Beery died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on April 15, 1949 (14 months, 1 week, and 1 day after Johan Schumm's birth) — while the suit was pending.  He died [[intestate]] (without a will). Beery had been reading a newspaper at his [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] home when he collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-wallace-beery-19490417-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;  His body was interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]].  The inscription on his grave reads, "No man is indispensable but some are irreplaceable."  When Mickey Rooney's [[Joe Yule|father]] died less than a year later, Rooney arranged to have him buried next to his old friend.  "I thought it was fitting that these two comedians should rest in peace, side by side," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Rooney, M. ''Life is Too Short''. Villard Books (1991), p. 239. {{ISBN|0679401954}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the paternity suit, Gloria's attorneys — initially Joseph L. Fainer (1897–1960), then Maurice Rose ''(né'' Maurice Morris Rosenberg; 1881–1973) with Kay Whyner ''(née'' Kate Whyner; 1910–1996), Rose's secretary acting as [[Legal guardian#Guardian ad litem|guardian ''ad litem'']] — demanded $104,135 against Beery's $2,220,000 estate.

Judge Newcomb Condee (1898–1974) of the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]], on February 22, 1952, approved a $26,750 settlement from Beery's estate – far less than what Gloria had been seeking.  Gloria Schumm finally accepted the settlement and Johan Beery's paternity was not admitted.

=== Enduring case law ===
The paternity suit, and subsequent suits – including appeals – extended through about 1952 and were internationally publicized, particularly in [[gossip columnist|gossip columns]] and [[Gossip magazine|tabloids]]. The litigation has endured as [[case law]] with, among other things, treatises addressing the rights of [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] offspring against [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]] heirs in races for [[inheritance]].&lt;ref name="Schumm-v-Berg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johann-Schumm-photos 1952" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Drennan 2016 Schumm v. Berg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="George-Korobkin 2017" /&gt;

The upshot was that Schumm's paternity suit against Beery's estate put would-be half-siblings and other would-be family [[legatees]], including a would-be uncle, [[Noah Beery, Sr.]], in the position as ''[[de facto]]'' defendants.  Phyllis Ann Riley was not named in Beery's will.  Part of plaintiff's claim, initially, hinged on whether an oral agreement was binding. Gloria had claimed that Beery, while alive, agreed to provide the child.  However, on November 17, 1949, Judge William B. McKesson (1895–1967) threw out Gloria's claim. The judge reasoned that any oral agreement between the two, specifically any that was intended to provide for maintenance and care of a minor, was not binding because the amount allegedly agreed upon was in excess of $500, which must be made in writing.&lt;ref name="LATimes 1949 Nov 18" /&gt;

Another matter in the case hinged on a "[[Peppercorn (legal)|peppercorn]]" rule. That is, in order for any agreement, oral or written, between Wallace and Gloria to be binding, there must be [[consideration]].  The court, initially, found that Beery agreed to an oral contract where Gloria would (i) include the name "Wallace" in the child's name if a male, or "Wally" if a female, and (ii) refrain from filing a paternity suit that both agreed would damage Beery's "social and professional standing as a prominent motion picture star."

Generally, under California state law at the time, a father who neither marries the mother nor acknowledges paternity does not have a right to name the child.  That right belongs to the mother. In exchange for Gloria's promise to name the child "Wallace" or "Wally" (the promise representing a form of [[consideration]]), Wallace Beery agreed to arrange for the payment of $100 per week to the child (as a [[third-party beneficiary]] under the contract), plus a lump sum of $25,000 to the child when he or she attained age 21, in addition to the customary obligation to pay for the "maintenance, support and education according to the station in life and standard of living of Wallace Beery."&lt;ref name="Drennan 2016 Schumm v. Berg" /&gt;

==Legacy==
For his contributions to the film industry, Wallace Beery posthumously received a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1960. His star is located at 7001 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].&lt;ref name=hwof/&gt;

Beery is mentioned in the film ''[[Barton Fink]]'', in which the lead character has been hired to write a wrestling screenplay to star Beery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/movies/film-he-s-nobody-important-really-just-a-movie-writer.html|title=FILM; He's Nobody Important, Really.

Wounded Warrior Project also promised to match $2 to every $1 raised by Rush to develop its program, up to $2.5 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150602/NEWS07/150609937/rush-to-expand-veterans-program-with-wounded-warrior-project-grant|title=Rush to expand veterans program with Wounded Warrior Project grant|last=Marotti|first=Ally|date=June 2, 2015|work=Crain's Chicago Business|access-date=2017-03-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility for PTSD treatment==
Veterans and active duty US military with mental health disorders or injuries incurred during deployment on or after [[September 11, 2001]] are eligible; there is no geographical restriction.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

To participate in the program and receive PTSD treatment at no cost, veterans, active duty military or caregivers must begin the screening process by filling out a form on the Wounded Warrior Project official website.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==PTSD treatments offered==
Warrior Care Network provides a six-week program which includes two to three weeks at the PTSD treatment center, and for some locations followed by three weeks care from home via telecommuting and social networking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The program can be used by veterans who have not already received mental health care or in addition to ongoing [[treatments for combat-related PTSD]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; PTSD treatment strategies include healing arts, wellness and community engagement. Treatment activities for veterans may include mediation, acupuncture and qi gong. Families are also included in the treatment and can receive training on therapy for trauma that effects concentration and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uscannenbergmedia.com/2016/04/13/uclas-operation-mend-announces-new-program-to-fight-veterans-mental-disorders/|title=UCLA's Operation Mend Announces New Program to Fight Veterans' Mental Disorders|last=Day|first=Duncan|date=April 13, 2016|work=USC Annenberg Media|access-date=2017-03-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapy can be performed in group sessions or individual sessions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Prolonged exposure therapy|Prolonged exposure]] (PE) is a best practice PTSD treatment that repeatedly exposes the patient to triggers or distressful thoughts related to the traumatic event, allowing the patient to learn how to manage resulting distress and deal with memories that had been avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://homelandmagazine.com/?p=2120|title=PTSD: A Warrior’s Life Before &amp; After {{!}} Homeland Magazine|last=Anderson|first=Vesta|date=|website=homelandmagazine.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure therapy is performed at Emory Brain Health Center using virtual reality sessions with a therapist, allowing the patient to talk through experiences.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Wounded Warrior Project's role ==
Registration for the program is conducted through the Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) website.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/programs/warrior-care-network|title=Warrior Care Network|website=Wounded Warrior Project|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wounded Warrior Project initiated the Warrior Care Network after performing a survey of veterans in 2014, finding over 76% of respondents had an untreated traumatic battle experience&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihexecutive.com/patient-care/population-health/article/20832001/new-network-offers-mental-health-care-for-troubled-veterans|title=New Network Offers Mental Health Care for Troubled Veterans|last=|first=|date=August 27, 2016|website=Integrated Healthcare Executive|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; despite existing [[Veterans benefits for post-traumatic stress disorder in the United States|veterans' benefits for PTSD]]. The program is designed to improve overall industry treatment and best practices for PTSD by tracking data and sharing results. According to WWP Chief Program Officer Jeremy Chwat, "Tapping into private health care [in conjunction with what is offered at Veterans Affairs] is something we think can benefit not only the warriors in our program but those who are accessing mental health treatment at the VA and other programs."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nndc.org/emory-university-massgeneral-hospital-involved-in-70m-wounded-warrior-project-effort/|title=Emory University &amp; MassGeneral Hospital Involved in $70M Wounded Warrior Project Effort|last=Kime|first=Patricia|date=June 18, 2015|website=nndc.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWP funded $15.7 million toward each of the four medical partners, a total of $62.8 million.
