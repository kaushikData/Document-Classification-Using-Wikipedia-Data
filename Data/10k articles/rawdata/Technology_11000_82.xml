In recent years, [[3D printing]] has developed enough to perform crucial roles in many applications, with the most important ones being manufacturing, medicine, architecture, custom art and design. Some companies even use 3D printers to create more 3D printers.

In the current scenario, we can see 3D printing processes finally catching up to their full potential, and are currently being used in the manufacturing and medical industries, as well as by sociocultural sectors which facilitate 3D printing to become successful commercial technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taufik|first1=Mohammad|last2=Jain|first2=Prashant K.|title= Additive Manufacturing: Current Scenario|url=https://www.ikbooks.com/books/book/engineering-computer-science/mechanical-production-industrial-engineering/proceedings-international-conference-on/9789385909511/|journal= Proceedings of International Conference on: Advanced Production and Industrial Engineering -ICAPIE 2016|date=2016-12-10| pages=380–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a lot of hype (and disappointment) in the last decade when referring to the possibilities we would achieve by adopting 3D printing as one of the main [[manufacturing]] technologies.

For a long time, the issue with 3D printing was that it had been demanding very high entry costs, not really allowing profitable implementation to mass-manufacturers when compared to standard processes, but market trends spotted in recent years have found that the needle is finally moving, as the market for 3D printing becomes one of the most important ones, and certainly the one with the biggest growth numbers in the manufacturing industry in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| Three-dimensional printing makes it as cheap to create single items as it is to produce thousands and thus undermines [[economies of scale]]. It may have as profound an impact on the world as the coming of the factory did (...) Just as nobody could have predicted the impact of the [[History of the steam engine|steam engine in 1750]]—or the [[Global spread of the printing press|printing press in 1450]], or the [[History of the transistor|transistor in 1950]]—it is impossible to foresee the long-term impact of 3D printing. But the technology is coming, and it is likely to disrupt every field it touches.

AM technologies found applications starting in the 1980s in [[product development]], [[data visualization]], [[rapid prototyping]], and specialized manufacturing. Their expansion into production ([[job production]], [[mass production]], and [[distributed manufacturing]]) has been under development in the decades since. Industrial production roles within the [[metalworking]] industries&lt;ref name="Zelinski_2014-06-25" /&gt; achieved significant scale for the first time in the early 2010s. Since the start of the 21st century there has been a large growth in the sales of AM machines, and their price has dropped substantially.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-2" /&gt; According to Wohlers Associates, a consultancy, the market for 3D printers and services was worth $2.2&amp;nbsp;billion worldwide in 2012, up 29% from 2011.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-2" /&gt; [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] predicts that additive manufacturing could have an economic impact of $550 billion annually by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21697802-3d-printing-coming-age-manufacturing-technique-printed-smile|title=A printed smile|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many applications for AM technologies, including architecture, construction (AEC), [[industrial design]], automotive, [[aerospace]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ref journal|title=Development of a Three-Dimensional Printed, Liquid-Cooled Nozzle for a Hybrid Rocket Motor|author1=Nick Quigley|author2=James Evans Lyne|journal=Journal of Propulsion and Power|volume=30|number=6|year=2014|pages=1726–1727}}&lt;/ref&gt; military, [[engineering]], dental and medical industries, biotech (human tissue replacement), fashion, footwear, jewelry, eyewear, education, geographic information systems, food, and many other fields.

Additive manufacturing's earliest applications have been on the [[toolroom]] end of the manufacturing spectrum. For example, [[rapid prototyping|rapid prototyping]] was one of the earliest additive variants, and its mission was to reduce the [[lead time]] and cost of developing prototypes of new parts and devices, which was earlier only done with subtractive toolroom methods such as CNC milling and turning, and precision grinding, far more accurate than 3d printing with accuracy down to 0.00005" and creating better quality parts faster, but sometimes too expensive for low accuracy prototype parts.&lt;ref name="TMW_2011-02_Origins" /&gt; With technological advances in additive manufacturing, however, and the dissemination of those advances into the business world, additive methods are moving ever further into the production end of manufacturing in creative and sometimes unexpected ways.&lt;ref name="TMW_2011-02_Origins" /&gt; Parts that were formerly the sole province of subtractive methods can now in some cases be made more profitably via additive ones. In addition, new developments in [[RepRap]] technology allow the same device to perform both additive and subtractive manufacturing by swapping magnetic-mounted tool heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anzalone | first1 = G. | last2 = Wijnen | first2 = B. | last3 = Pearce | first3 = Joshua M. | year = 2015 | title = Multi-material additive and subtractive prosumer digital fabrication with a free and open-source convertible delta RepRap 3-D printer | url =https://www.academia.edu/15352556/Multi-material_additive_and_subtractive_prosumer_digital_fabrication_with_a_free_and_open-source_convertible_delta_RepRap_3-D_printer |journal = Rapid Prototyping Journal | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 506–519 | doi = 10.1108/RPJ-09-2014-0113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cloud-based additive manufacturing ===
{{Main|3D printing marketplace}}
Additive manufacturing in combination with [[cloud computing]] technologies allows decentralized and geographically independent distributed production.&lt;ref name="Bopp2010" /&gt; Cloud-based additive manufacturing refers to a service-oriented networked manufacturing model in which service consumers are able to build parts through Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Hardware-as-a-Service (HaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wu | first1 = D. | last2 = Thames | first2 = J.L. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = D.W. | last4 = Schaefer | first4 = D. | year = 2013 | title = Enhancing the Product Realization Process with Cloud-Based Design and Manufacturing Systems."

Some companies offer online 3D printing services to both commercial and private customers,&lt;ref name="Auto3D-28" /&gt; working from 3D designs uploaded to the company website. 3D-printed designs are either shipped to the customer or picked up from the service provider.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-29" /&gt;

=== Mass customization ===
{{Main|Mass customization}}
[[File:Miniature human face models made through 3D Printing (Rapid Prototyping).jpg|thumb|Miniature face models (from FaceGen) produced using Ceramic Based material on a Full Colour 3D Inkjet Printer]]
Companies have created services where consumers can customize objects using simplified web based customization software, and order the resulting items as 3D printed unique objects.&lt;ref name="AutoQK-2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoQK-3" /&gt; This now allows consumers to create custom cases for their mobile phones.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-34" /&gt; Nokia has released the 3D designs for its case so that owners can customize their own case and have it 3D printed.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-35" /&gt;

=== Rapid manufacturing ===
Advances in RP technology have introduced materials that are appropriate for final manufacture, which has in turn introduced the possibility of directly manufacturing finished components. One advantage of 3D printing for rapid manufacturing lies in the relatively inexpensive production of small numbers of parts.

Rapid manufacturing is a new method of manufacturing and many of its processes remain unproven. 3D printing is now entering the field of rapid manufacturing and was identified as a "next level" technology by many experts in a 2009 report.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-19" /&gt; One of the most promising processes looks to be the adaptation of [[selective laser sintering]] (SLS), or [[direct metal laser sintering]] (DMLS) some of the better-established rapid prototyping methods. {{As of|2006}}, however, these techniques were still very much in their infancy, with many obstacles to be overcome before RM could be considered a realistic manufacturing method.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-20" /&gt;

There have been patent lawsuits concerning 3-D printing for manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Rapid prototyping ===
{{Main|Rapid prototyping}}
Industrial 3D printers have existed since the early 1980s and have been used extensively for rapid prototyping and research purposes. These are generally larger machines that use proprietary powdered metals, casting media (e.g. sand), plastics, paper or cartridges, and are used for [[rapid prototyping]] by universities and commercial companies.

=== Research ===
3D printing can be particularly useful in research labs due to its ability to make specialized, bespoke geometries. In 2012 a [[proof of principle]] project at the [[University of Glasgow]], UK, showed that it is possible to use 3D printing techniques to assist in the production of [[chemical compound]]s. They first printed chemical [[reaction vessel]]s, then used the printer to deposit [[reactant]]s into them.&lt;ref name="chem" /&gt; They have produced new compounds to verify the validity of the process, but have not pursued anything with a particular application.

Usually, the FDM process is used to print hollow reaction vessels or microreactors.&lt;ref name="chem" /&gt; If the 3D print is performed within an [[inert gas]] atmosphere, the reaction vessels can be filled with highly reactive substances during the print. The 3D printed objects are air- and watertight for several weeks. By the print of reaction vessels in the geometry of common [[cuvette]]s or measurement tubes, routine analytical measurements such as [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|UV/VIS]]-, [[Infrared spectroscopy|IR]]- and [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR-spectroscopy]] can be performed directly in the 3D printed vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lederle|first1=Felix|last2=Kaldun|first2=Christian|last3=Namyslo|first3=Jan C.|last4=Hübner|first4=Eike G.|title=3D-Printing inside the Glovebox: A Versatile Tool for Inert-Gas Chemistry Combined with Spectroscopy|journal=Helvetica Chimica Acta|date=April 2016|volume=99|issue=4|pages=255–266|doi=10.1002/hlca.201500502|pmid=27134300|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hlca.201500502/full|pmc=4840480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, 3D printing has been used in research labs as alternative method to manufacture components for use in experiments, such as magnetic shielding and vacuum components with demonstrated performance comparable to traditionally produced parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vovrosh|first1=Jamie|last2=Georgios|first2=Voulazeris|last3=Plamen|first3=G. Petrov|last4=Ji|first4=Zou|last5=Youssef|first5=Gaber|last6=Laura|first6=Benn|last7=David|first7=Woolger|last8=Moataz|first8=M. Attallah|last9=Vincent|first9=Boyer|last10=Kai|first10=Bongs|last11=Michael|first11=Holynski|title=Additive manufacturing of magnetic shielding and ultra-high vacuum flange for cold atom sensors|journal=Scientific Reports|date=31 January 2018|volume=8|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-20352-x|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20352-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food ===
Additive manufacturing of food is being developed by squeezing out food, layer by layer, into three-dimensional objects. A large variety of foods are appropriate candidates, such as chocolate and candy, and flat foods such as crackers, pasta,&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-72" /&gt; and pizza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Did BeeHex Just Hit 'Print' to Make Pizza at Home? | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/cohan-chew/did-beehex-just-hit-print_b_10108424.html|accessdate =28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foodini 3D Printer Cooks Up Meals Like the Star Trek Food Replicator|url=http://inhabitat.com/foodini-3d-printer-will-make-all-your-meals-for-you-like-the-star-trek-food-replicator|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA has considered the versatility of the concept, awarding a contract to the Systems and Materials Research Consultancy to study the feasibility of printing food in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3D Printing: Food in Space | url = http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/home/feature_3d_food_prt.htm | publisher = NASA | accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the problems with food printing is the nature of the texture of a food. For example, foods that are not strong enough to be filed are not appropriate for 3D printing.

=== Agile tooling ===
[[Agile tooling]] is the process of using modular means to design tooling that is produced by additive manufacturing or 3D printing methods to enable quick [[Prototype|prototyping]] and responses to tooling and fixture needs. Agile tooling uses a cost-effective and high-quality method to quickly respond to customer and market needs. It can be used in [[Hydroforming|hydro-forming]], [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamping]], [[Injection molding machine|injection molding]] and other manufacturing processes.

== Medical applications ==
Surgical uses of 3D printing-centric therapies have a history beginning in the mid-1990s with anatomical modeling for bony reconstructive surgery planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An opinion survey of reported benefits from the use of stereolithographic models|first1=D.

One example of this is the bioresorbable trachial splint to treat newborns with [[tracheobronchomalacia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc1206319|title=Bioresorbable Airway Splint Created with a Three-Dimensional Printer|first1=David A.|last1=Zopf|first2=Scott J.|last2=Hollister|first3=Marc E.|last3=Nelson|first4=Richard G.|last4=Ohye|first5=Glenn E.|last5=Green|date=23 May 2013|publisher=|volume=368|issue=21|pages=2043–2045|access-date=23 February 2017|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1056/NEJMc1206319|pmid=23697530|journal=N Engl J Med}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed at the University of Michigan. Several devices manufacturers have also begin using 3D printing for patient-matched surgical guides (polymers). The use of additive manufacturing for serialized production of orthopedic implants (metals) is also increasing due to the ability to efficiently create porous surface structures that facilitate osseointegration. Printed casts for broken bones can be custom-fitted and open, letting the wearer scratch any itches, wash and ventilate the damaged area. They can also be recycled.

Fused filament fabrication (FFF) has been used to create microstructures with a three-dimensional internal geometry. Sacrificial structures or additional support materials are not needed. Structure using [[polylactic acid]] (PLA) can have fully controllable porosity in the range 20%–60%. Such scaffolds could serve as biomedical templates for cell culturing, or biodegradable implants for tissue engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/5/4/839|title=3D Microporous Scaffolds Manufactured via Combination of Fused Filament Fabrication and Direct Laser Writing Ablation|publisher=MDPI|accessdate=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:3D Printed Macrognathism.jpg|thumbnail|3D printed human skull from computed computer tomography data]]

3D printing has been used to print patient-specific implant and device for medical use. Successful operations include a titanium [[pelvis]] implanted into a British patient, titanium lower [[jaw]] transplanted to a Dutch patient,&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-47" /&gt; and a plastic [[vertebrate trachea|tracheal]] splint for an American infant.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-48" /&gt; The hearing aid and dental industries are expected to be the biggest areas of future development using custom 3D printing technology.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-49" /&gt; In March 2014, surgeons in Swansea used 3D printed parts to rebuild the face of a motorcyclist who had been seriously injured in a road accident.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-50" /&gt; Research is also being conducted on methods to bio-print replacements for lost tissue due to arthritis and cancer {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}.

3D printing technology can now be used to make exact replicas of organs. The printer uses images from patients' MRI or CT scan images as a template and lays down layers of rubber or plastic.

{{See also|Molecular machine#Biological|l1=Biomolecular printing}}In 2006, researchers at Cornell University published some of the pioneer work in 3D printing for tissue fabrication, successfully printing hydrogel bio-inks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Direct freeform fabrication of seeded hydrogels in arbitrary geometries|first1=Daniel L.|last1=Cohen|first2=Evan|last2=Malone|first3=Hod|last3=Lipson|first4=Lawrence J.|last4=Bonassar|date=1 May 2006|publisher=|journal=Tissue Eng.|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1325–1335|doi=10.1089/ten.2006.12.1325|pmid=16771645}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work at Cornell was expanded using specialized bioprinters produced by [http://www.scientist3d.com Seraph Robotics, Inc.], a university spin-out, which helped to catalyze a global interest in biomedical 3D printing research.

3D printing has been considered as a method of implanting [[Gene therapy|stem cells]] capable of generating new tissues and organs in living humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RFA-HD-15-023: Use of 3-D Printers for the Production of Medical Devices (R43/R44)|url=http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-15-023.html|publisher=NIH grants|accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; With their ability to transform into any other kind of cell in the human body, stem cells offer huge potential in 3D bioprinting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=7 Ways 3D Printing Is Disrupting The Medical Industry|url=http://3dmasterminds.com/7-ways-3d-printing-is-disrupting-the-medical-industry/|website=3D Masterminds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Leroy Cronin]] of [[Glasgow University]] proposed in a 2012 [[TED Talk]] that it was possible to use chemical inks to print medicine.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-71" /&gt;

{{As of|2012}}, 3D [[bio-printing]] technology has been studied by [[biotechnology]] firms and academia for possible use in tissue engineering applications in which organs and body parts are built using inkjet techniques. In this process, layers of living cells are deposited onto a gel medium or sugar matrix and slowly built up to form three-dimensional structures including vascular systems.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-38" /&gt; The first production system for 3D tissue printing was delivered in 2009, based on [[NovoGen]] bioprinting technology.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-46" /&gt; Several terms have been used to refer to this field of research: organ printing, bio-printing, body part printing,&lt;ref name="Auto3D-39" /&gt; and computer-aided [[tissue engineering]], among others.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-40" /&gt; The possibility of using 3D tissue printing to create soft tissue architectures for reconstructive surgery is also being explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering.com/3DPrinting/3DPrintingArticles/ArticleID/7379/Engineering-Ourselves-The-Future-Potential-Power-of-3D-Bioprinting.aspx|title=Engineering Ourselves – The Future Potential Power of 3D-Bioprinting?|publisher=ENGINEERING.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Chinese scientists began printing ears, livers and kidneys, with living tissue. Researchers in China have been able to successfully print [[human organs]] using specialized 3D bioprinters that use living cells instead of plastic {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. Researchers at [[Hangzhou Dianzi University]] designed the "3D bioprinter" dubbed the "Regenovo". Xu Mingen, Regenovo's developer, said that it can produce a miniature sample of liver tissue or ear cartilage in less than an hour, predicting that fully functional printed organs might take 10 to 20 years to develop.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-76" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-77" /&gt;

=== Medical devices ===
On October 24, 2014, a five-year-old girl born without fully formed fingers on her left hand became the first child in the UK to have a prosthetic hand made with 3D printing technology. Her hand was designed by US-based e-NABLE, an [[Open design#Open-design organizations|open source design organisation]] which uses a network of volunteers to design and make prosthetics mainly for children. The prosthetic hand was based on a plaster cast made by her parents.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News (October 2014).

Retrieved 2014-10-02.&lt;/ref&gt; A boy named Alex was also born with a missing arm from just above the elbow. The team was able to use 3D printing to upload an e-NABLE Myoelectric arm that runs off of servos and batteries that are actuated by the electromyography muscle. With the use of 3D printers, e-NABLE has so far distributed thousands of plastic hands to children.

== Industrial applications ==

=== Apparel ===
[[File:XYZprinting inBloom Dress 3D Printed Outfit (16837487086).jpg|thumb|inBloom 3D printed outfit]]
3D printing has entered the world of clothing with fashion designers experimenting with 3D-printed [[bikini]]s, shoes, and dresses.&lt;ref name="resins-online.com" /&gt; In commercial production Nike used 3D printing to prototype and manufacture the 2012 Vapor Laser Talon football shoe for players of American football, and New Balance is 3D manufacturing custom-fit shoes for athletes.&lt;ref name="resins-online.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-45" /&gt;

3D printing has come to the point where companies are printing consumer grade eyewear with on-demand custom fit and styling (although they cannot print the lenses). On-demand customization of glasses is possible with rapid prototyping.&lt;ref name="Forbes.com" /&gt;

However, comments have been made in academic circles as to the potential limitation of the human acceptance of such mass customized apparel items due to the potential reduction of brand value communication.&lt;ref&gt;Parker C. J. (2015). The Human Acceptance of 3D Printing in Fashion Paradox: Is mass customisation a bridge too far? IWAMA 2015: 5th International Workshop of Advanced Manufacturing and Automation.

=== Construction ===
{{Main|Construction 3D printing}}
The use of 3D printing to produce scale models within architecture and construction has steadily increased in popularity as the cost of 3D printers has reduced. This has enabled faster turn around of such scale models and allowed a steady increase in the speed of production and the complexity of the objects being produced.

Construction 3D printing, the application of 3D printing to fabricate construction components or entire buildings has been in development since the mid-1990s, development of new technologies has steadily gained pace since 2012 and the sub-sector of 3D printing is beginning to mature. See main article.

=== Firearms ===
{{Main|3D printed firearms}}
In 2012, the US-based group [[Defense Distributed]] disclosed plans to "[design] a working plastic [[gun]] that could be downloaded and reproduced by anybody with a 3D printer."&lt;ref name="f20120823" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pcm20120824" /&gt; Defense Distributed has also designed a 3D printable AR-15 type rifle [[lower receiver]] (capable of lasting more than 650 rounds) and a 30-round M16 magazine. The AR-15 has multiple receivers (both an upper and lower receiver), but the legally controlled part is the one that is serialized (the lower, in the AR-15's case). Soon after Defense Distributed succeeded in designing the first working blueprint to produce a plastic gun with a 3D printer in May 2013, the [[United States Department of State]] demanded that they remove the instructions from their website.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-53" /&gt; After Defense Distributed released their plans, questions were raised regarding the effects that 3D printing and widespread consumer-level [[CNC]] machining&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-54" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-55" /&gt; may have on [[gun control]] effectiveness.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-56" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-57" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-58" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-59" /&gt;

Most construction planned on asteroids or planets will be bootstrapped somehow using the materials available on those objects. 3D printing is often one of the steps in this bootstrapping. The Sinterhab project is researching a lunar base constructed by 3D printing using [[Lunar soil|lunar regolith]] as a base material. Instead of adding a binding agent to the regolith, researchers are experimenting with microwave [[sintering]] to create solid blocks from the raw material.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-73" /&gt;

Projects like these have been investigated for construction of off-Earth habitats.&lt;ref name="tc20120120" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmodo20130131" /&gt;

== Sociocultural applications ==
[[File:Ted Noten Fashionista in green 2009.jpg|thumb|An example of 3D printed limited edition [[jewellery]]. This necklace is made of glassfiber-filled dyed nylon. It has rotating linkages that were produced in the same manufacturing step as the other parts]]

In 2005, a rapidly expanding hobbyist and home-use market was established with the inauguration of the [[open-source]] [[RepRap]] and [[Fab@Home]] projects. Virtually all home-use 3D printers released to-date have their technical roots in the ongoing RepRap Project and associated open-source software initiatives.&lt;ref name="reprap heritage" /&gt; In distributed manufacturing, one study has found&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-3" /&gt; that 3D printing could become a mass market product enabling consumers to save money associated with purchasing common household objects.&lt;ref name="wittbrodt" /&gt; For example, instead of going to a store to buy an object made in a factory by [[injection molding]] (such as a [[measuring cup]] or a [[funnel]]), a person might instead print it at home from a downloaded 3D model.

=== Art and jewelry ===
In 2005, academic journals began to report on the possible artistic applications of 3D printing technology,&lt;ref name="Auto3D-34" /&gt; being used by artists such as [[Martin John Callanan]] at [[The Bartlett]] school of architecture. By 2007 the mass media followed with an article in the Wall Street Journal&lt;ref name="Auto3D-35" /&gt; and Time Magazine, listing a printed design among their 100 most influential designs of the year.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-36" /&gt; During the 2011 London Design Festival, an installation, curated by Murray Moss and focused on 3D Printing, was held in the Victoria and Albert Museum (the V&amp;A). The installation was called ''Industrial Revolution 2.0: How the Material World will Newly Materialize''.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-37" /&gt;

At the [[3DPrintshow]] in London, which took place in November 2013 and 2014, the art sections had works made with 3D printed plastic and metal. Several artists such as Joshua Harker, [[Davide Prete]], Sophie Kahn, Helena Lukasova, Foteini Setaki showed how 3D printing can modify aesthetic and art processes.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-80" /&gt; In 2015, engineers and designers at MIT's Mediated Matter Group and Glass Lab created an additive 3D printer that prints with glass, called ''[[G3DP]]''. The results can be structural as well as artistic. Transparent glass vessels printed on it are part of some museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/mits-neri-oxman-on-the-true-beauty-of-3d-printed-glass_o|title=MIT's Neri Oxman on the True Beauty of 3D Printed Glass|date=2015-08-28|work=Architect|accessdate=2017-03-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[3D scanning]] technologies allows the replication of real objects without the use of [[molding (process)|moulding]] techniques that in many cases can be more expensive, more difficult, or too invasive to be performed, particularly for precious artwork or delicate cultural heritage artifacts&lt;ref name="Auto3D-42" /&gt; where direct contact with the moulding substances could harm the original object's surface.

=== 3D selfies ===

{{Main|3D selfie}}

[[File:Fantasitron photo booth at Madurodam can scan up to two people at a time IMG 3797 FRD.jpg|thumb|Fantasitron 3D photo booth at [[Madurodam]]]]

A 3D photo booth such as the Fantasitron located at [[Madurodam]], the miniature park, generates 3D selfie models from 2D pictures of customers. These selfies are often printed by dedicated 3D printing companies such as [[Shapeways]]. These models are also known as 3D portraits, 3D figurines or mini-me figurines.

=== Communication ===
Employing additive layer technology offered by 3D printing, Terahertz devices which act as waveguides, couplers and bends have been created. The complex shape of these devices could not be achieved using conventional fabrication techniques. Commercially available professional grade printer EDEN 260V was used to create structures with minimum feature size of 100&amp;nbsp;µm. The printed structures were later DC sputter coated with gold (or any other metal) to create a Terahertz Plasmonic Device.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-74" /&gt;
In 2016 artist/scientist Janine Carr Created the first 3d printed vocal percussion (beatbox) as a waveform, with the ability to play the soundwave by laser, along with four vocalised emotions these were also playable by laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/j9.beatbox/posts/1391340137560726|title=I have been working on my #solidsounds... - Janine Ling Carr - Facebook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic use ===
Some early consumer examples of 3d printing include the [[64DD]] released in 1999 in Japan.&lt;ref name="Virtually Overlooked: Mario Artist"&gt;{{ cite web | title=Virtually Overlooked: Mario Artist | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/08/28/virtually-overlooked-mario-artist/ | date=August 28, 2008 | first=JC | last=Fletcher | accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon Studio at 64DD.net"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mario Artist: Polygon Studio | url=http://64dd.net/modules/games/?system=64dd&amp;type=released&amp;section=main&amp;id=7 | accessdate=2014-06-14 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113081755/http://64dd.net/modules/games/?system=64dd&amp;type=released&amp;section=main&amp;id=7# | archive-date=2014-01-13 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, domestic 3D printing was mainly practiced by hobbyists and enthusiasts. However, little was used for practical household applications, for example, ornamental objects. Some practical examples include a working clock&lt;ref name="Auto3D-21" /&gt; and [[gear]]s printed for home woodworking machines among other purposes.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-23" /&gt; Web sites associated with home 3D printing tended to include backscratchers, coat hooks, door knobs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yeggi.com/q/backscratcher/?s=tt|title="backscratcher" 3D Models to Print - yeggi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The open source Fab@Home project&lt;ref name="fabathome" /&gt; has developed printers for general use. They have been used in research environments to produce chemical compounds with 3D printing technology, including new ones, initially without immediate application as proof of principle.&lt;ref name="chem" /&gt; The printer can print with anything that can be dispensed from a syringe as liquid or paste. The developers of the chemical application envisage both industrial and domestic use for this technology, including enabling users in remote locations to be able to produce their own medicine or household chemicals.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-25" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_2012-04-17" /&gt;

3D printing is now working its way into households, and more and more children are being introduced to the concept of 3D printing at earlier ages. The prospects of 3D printing are growing, and as more people have access to this new innovation, new uses in households will emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=D'Aveni|first1=Richard|title=3-D Printing Will Change the World|url=http://hbr.org/2013/03/3-d-printing-will-change-the-world/|website=Harvard Business Review |date=March 2013 |accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OpenReflex [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] [[Photographic film|film]] camera was developed for 3D printing as an open-source student project.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-44" /&gt;

=== Education and research ===
[[File:PAECT 3D Printing Students.jpg|thumbnail|[[High school (North America)|High School]] students from Wyomissing Area Jr/Sr High School in Pennsylvania, United States present their use of 3D Printing in the classroom]]
3D printing, and open source 3D printers in particular, are the latest technology making inroads into the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Schelly, C., Anzalone, G., Wijnen, B., &amp; Pearce, J. M. (2015). "Open-source 3-D printing Technologies for education: Bringing Additive Manufacturing to the Classroom." ''Journal of Visual Languages &amp; Computing''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grujović, N., Radović, M., Kanjevac, V., Borota, J., Grujović, G., &amp; Divac, D. (2011, September). "3D printing technology in education environment." In ''34th International Conference on Production Engineering'' (pp. 29–30).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercuri, R., &amp; Meredith, K. (2014, March). "An educational venture into 3D Printing." In Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC), 2014 IEEE (pp. 1–6). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; 3D printing allows students to create prototypes of items without the use of expensive tooling required in subtractive methods. Students design and produce actual models they can hold. The classroom environment allows students to learn and employ new applications for 3D printing.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-60" /&gt; RepRaps, for example, have already been used for an educational mobile robotics platform.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez-Gomez, J., Valero-Gomez, A., Prieto-Moreno, A., &amp; Abderrahim, M. (2012). "A new open source 3d-printable mobile robotic platform for education." In ''Advances in Autonomous Mini Robots'' (pp. 49–62). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have claimed that 3D printers offer an unprecedented "revolution" in [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]] education.&lt;ref&gt;J. Irwin, J.M. Pearce, D. Opplinger, and G. Anzalone. [https://www.academia.edu/9647945/The_RepRap_3-D_Printer_Revolution_in_STEM_Education The RepRap 3-D Printer Revolution in STEM Education], ''121st ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Indianapolis, IN''. Paper ID #8696 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence for such claims comes from both the low cost ability for [[rapid prototyping]] in the classroom by students, but also the fabrication of low-cost high-quality scientific equipment from [[open hardware]] designs forming [[open-source labs]].&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-68" /&gt; Engineering and design principles are explored as well as architectural planning. Students recreate duplicates of museum items such as fossils and historical artifacts for study in the classroom without possibly damaging sensitive collections. Other students interested in graphic designing can construct models with complex working parts easily. 3D printing gives students a new perspective with topographic maps. Science students can study cross-sections of internal organs of the human body and other biological specimens. And chemistry students can explore 3D models of molecules and the relationship within chemical compounds.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-61" /&gt;

According to a recent paper by Kostakis et al.,&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-62" /&gt; 3D printing and design can electrify various literacies and creative capacities of children in accordance with the spirit of the interconnected, information-based world.

Future applications for 3D printing might include creating open-source scientific equipment.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-68" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoQK-4" /&gt;

=== Environmental use ===
In [[Bahrain]], large-scale 3D printing using a [[sandstone]]-like material has been used to create unique [[coral]]-shaped structures, which encourage coral [[polyp]]s to colonize and regenerate damaged [[reef]]s. These structures have a much more natural shape than other structures used to create [[artificial reef]]s, and, unlike concrete, are neither acid nor alkaline with neutral [[pH]].&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-79" /&gt;

=== Cultural heritage ===
[[File:3D Printed Ancient Egyptian Figurine.png|thumb|3D printed sculpture of the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Merankhre Mentuhotep]] shown at [[Threeding]]]]

In the last several years 3D printing has been intensively used by in the [[cultural heritage]] field for preservation, restoration and dissemination purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scopigno|first1=R.|last2=Cignoni|first2=P.|last3=Pietroni|first3=N.|last4=Callieri|first4=M.|last5=Dellepiane|first5=M.

[[Scan the World]] is the largest archive of 3D printable objects of cultural significance from across the globe. Each object, originating from 3D scan data provided by their community, is optimised for 3D printing and free to download on [[MyMiniFactory]]. Through working alongside museums, such as The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/arts-and-books/the-art-of-copying-digital-archeology-palmyra|title=The art of copying|date=2016-06-14 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and private collectors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/inside-private-art-collections-scan-world-106451/|title=Inside private art collections with Scan the World|date=2017-02-23 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the initiative serves as a platform for democratizing the art object.

The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and the [[British Museum]] have started using their 3D printers to create museum souvenirs that are available in the museum shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/british-museum-releases-scans-of-artefacts-to-let-you-3d-print-your-own-museum-at-home-9837654.html|title=British Museum releases 3D printer scans of artefacts|date=2014-11-04 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other museums, like the National Museum of Military History and Varna Historical Museum, have gone further and sell through the online platform [[Threeding]] digital models of their artifacts, created using [[Artec 3D]] scanners, in 3D printing friendly file format, which everyone can 3D print at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3dprint.com/45699/threeding-artec-museum/|title=Threeding Uses Artec 3D Scanning Technology to Catalog 3D Models for Bulgaria's National Museum of Military History|date=2015-02-20 |publisher=3dprint.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specialty materials ===
Consumer grade 3D printing has resulted in new materials that have been developed specifically for 3D printers. For example, filament materials have been developed to imitate wood in its appearance as well as its texture. Furthermore, new technologies, such as infusing carbon fiber&lt;ref name="carbon-fiber" /&gt; into printable plastics, allowing for a stronger, lighter material. In addition to new structural materials that have been developed due to 3D printing, new technologies have allowed for patterns to be applied directly to 3D printed parts. Iron oxide-free [[Portland cement]] powder has been used to create architectural structures up to 9 feet in height.&lt;ref name=sanfranciscocbs&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/03/06/researchers-at-uc-berkeley-create-bloom-first-ever-3-d-printed-cement-structure-that-stands-9-feet-tall/|title=Researchers at UC Berkeley Create Bloom First Ever 3D-printed Cement Structure That Stands 9 Feet Tall|accessdate=23 April 2015|date=6 March 2015|publisher=cbs sanfrancisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inhabitat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/worlds-largest-3d-printed-building-made-from-powdered-cement-unveiled-at-uc-berkeley/|title=UC Berkeley unveils 3D-printed "Bloom" building made of powdered cement|date=9 March 2015|accessdate=23 April 2015|first=Mike|last=Chino}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=archrecord&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2015/03/150306-Print-it-Real-Good-First-powder-based-3D-Print-Cement-Structure-unveiled-at-UC-Berkeley.asp|date=6 March 2015|accessdate=23 April 2015|title=Print it Real Good: First Powder-Based 3D Printed Cement Structure Unveiled|first=Anna|last=Fixsen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boomerang.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A typical wooden returning boomerang]]
A '''boomerang''' is a thrown tool, typically constructed as a flat [[airfoil]], that is designed to spin about an axis perpendicular to the direction of its flight. A returning boomerang is designed to return to the thrower. It is well known as a weapon used by [[Indigenous Australians]] for hunting.

Boomerangs have been historically used for [[Hunting in Australia|hunting]], as well as sport, and entertainment. They are commonly thought of as an [[Australia]]n icon,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Boomerang: Behind an Australian Icon|last = Jones|first = Philip|publisher = Wakefield Press|year = 1996|isbn = 9781862543829|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and come in various shapes and sizes.

== Description ==
[[File:Boomerang (PSF).jpg|thumb|A boomerang returns to the point from where it was sent]]
A boomerang is traditionally a long wooden device, although historically boomerang-like devices have also been made from bones.  Modern boomerangs used for [[sport]] are often made from thin aircraft plywood, plastics such as [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[polypropylene]], [[phenolic paper]], or even high-tech materials such as [[Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre-reinforced plastics]]. Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on their geographic or tribal origins and intended function. Many people think of a boomerang as the Australian type, although today there are many types of more easily usable boomerangs, such as the cross-stick, the pinwheel, the tumble-stick, the Boomabird and many other less common types.

An important distinction should be made between returning boomerangs and non-returning boomerangs. Returning boomerangs fly and are examples of the earliest heavier-than-air human-made flight. A returning boomerang has two or more [[airfoil]] wings arranged so that the spinning creates unbalanced [[aerodynamic]] forces that curve its path so that it travels in an [[Ellipse|elliptical]] path and returns to its point of origin when thrown correctly. While a [[throwing stick]] can also be shaped overall like a returning boomerang, it is designed to travel as straight as possible so that it can be aimed and thrown with great force to bring down the game. Its surfaces therefore are symmetrical and not uneven like the aerofoils which give the returning boomerang its characteristic curved flight.

The most recognisable type of the boomerang is the L-shaped returning boomerang; while non-returning boomerangs, throwing sticks (or shaunies) were used as weapons, returning boomerangs have been used primarily for leisure or recreation. Returning boomerangs were also used to decoy birds of prey, thrown above the long grass to frighten [[game (food)|game]] birds into flight and into waiting nets. Modern returning boomerangs can be of [[#Modern use|various shapes or sizes]].

Historical evidence also points to the use of non-returning boomerangs by the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of [[California]] and [[Arizona]], and inhabitants of southern [[India]] for killing birds and rabbits.&lt;ref name="Brittanica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title = Boomerang |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/73646/boomerang |accessdate= 25 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, some boomerangs were not thrown at all, but were used in [[hand to hand combat]] by [[Indigenous Australians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Tom |url= http://www.howstuffworks.com/boomerang.htm/printable |title= Battle Boomerangs |publisher= Howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Egypt]]ian examples, however, have been recovered, and experiments have shown that they functioned as returning boomerangs.&lt;ref&gt;Rivers, Pitt.

Boomerangs can be variously used as hunting weapons, [[Percussion instrument|percussive musical instruments]], battle [[Club (weapon)|clubs]], fire-starters, [[decoy]]s for hunting [[waterfowl]], and as recreational play toys. The smallest boomerang may be less than {{convert|10|cm|in|0}} from tip to tip, and the largest over {{cvt|180|cm|ft|1}} in length.&lt;ref name="Largest"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.flight-toys.com/boomerang/boomnews/worldslargestboom.html |author=Ted Bailey |title= Worlds Largest Boomerang |publisher= www.flight-toys.com |accessdate= 17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tribe|Tribal]] boomerangs may be inscribed and/or painted with designs meaningful to their makers. Most boomerangs seen today are of the tourist or competition sort, and are almost invariably of the returning type.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the term is mostly certain, but many researchers have different theories on how the word entered into the English vocabulary. One source asserts that the term entered the language in 1827, adapted from an extinct Aboriginal language of [[New South Wales]], Australia, but mentions a variant, ''wo-mur-rang'', which it dates to 1798.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=boomerang&amp;searchmode=none Boomerang], [http://www.etymonline.com/ Online Etymology Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt; The boomerang was first encountered by western people at [[Farm Cove, New South Wales|Farm Cove]] ([[Port Jackson]]), Australia, in December 1804, when a weapon was witnessed during a tribal [[Skirmisher|skirmish]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626558 |title=SYDNEY |publisher= NLA Australian Newspapers |date= |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... the ''white'' spectators were justly astonished at the dexterity and incredible force with which a bent, edged waddy resembling slightly a Turkish [[scimitar|scimytar]], was thrown by ''Bungary'', a native distinguished by his remarkable courtesy.

Depictions of boomerangs being thrown at animals, such as kangaroos, appear in some of the oldest rock art in the world, the [[Indigenous Australian art|Indigenous Australian rock art]] of the Kimberly region, which is potentially up to 50,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-02/indigenous-rock-art-could-be-among-oldest-in-world/6906476 |title= Kimberley rock art could be among oldest in the world |website= ABC News AU |language=en-AU |accessdate= 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stencils and paintings of boomerangs also appear in the rock art of [[Western New Guinea|West Papua]], including on [[Bird's Head Peninsula]] and [[Kaimana]], likely dating to the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], when lower sea levels led to cultural continuity between Papua and [[Arnhem Land]] in Northern Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001355/135558e.pdf |title= Rock Art in West Papua |last=Arifin |first=Karina |publisher=UNESCO Publishing |year=2004 |isbn= |location= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest surviving [[Australian Aborigines|Australian Aboriginal]] boomerangs come from a cache found in a peat bog in the Wyrie Swamp of [[South Australia]] and date to [[8th millennium BC|10,000 BC]].

No one knows for sure how the returning boomerang was invented, but some modern boomerang makers speculate that it developed from the flattened throwing stick, still used by the [[Australian Aborigines]] and other indigenous peoples around the world, including the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] in North America. A hunting boomerang is delicately balanced and much harder to make than a returning one. The curving flight characteristic of returning boomerangs was probably first noticed by early hunters trying to "tune" their throwing sticks to fly straight.&lt;ref name="Boomer" /&gt;

Today, boomerangs are mostly used for recreation. There are different types of throwing contests: accuracy of return; Aussie round; trick catch; [[maximum time aloft]]; fast catch; and endurance (see below). The modern sport boomerang (often referred to as a 'boom' or 'rang') is made of Finnish birch [[plywood]], [[hardwood]], plastic or [[composite material]]s and comes in many different shapes and colours. Most sport boomerangs typically weigh less than {{convert|100|g|oz}}, with MTA boomerangs (boomerangs used for the maximum-time-aloft event) often under {{convert|25|g|oz|1}}.

Boomerangs have also been suggested as an alternative to [[clay pigeons]] in shotgun sports, where the flight of the boomerang better mimics the flight of a bird offering a more challenging target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwv2BhJEjDo |title= Aussie Boomerang Shootin' |date= 15 October 2012 |work= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern boomerang is often [[computer-aided design]]ed with precision airfoils. The number of "wings" is often more than 2 as more lift is provided by 3 or 4 wings than by 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boomerangs.com/aerodynamics.html Boomerang Aerodynamics], [http://www.boomerangs.com/ boomerangs.com].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saulius Pakalnis, [http://www.researchsupporttechnologies.com/boomerang_site/boomerang1.htm Aerodynamics of Boomerang], 21 April 2006, [http://www.researchsupporttechnologies.com/ researchsupporttechnologies.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, German astronaut [[Ulf Merbold]] performed an experiment aboard [[Spacelab]] that established that boomerangs function in [[Weightlessness|zero gravity]] as they do on Earth. French Astronaut [[Jean-François Clervoy]] aboard Mir repeated this in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.flight-toys.com/boomerang/boomnews/spacebooms.html |title=Boomerangs in Space |publisher= Flight-toys.com |date= 18 March 2008 |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Japanese astronaut [[Takao Doi]] again repeated the experiment on board the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23411383-952,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324172123/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0%2C23739%2C23411383-952%2C00.html |archivedate= 24 March 2008 |title= Boomerang works in space, says astronaut |publisher= News.com.au |date= 21 March 2008 |accessdate=3 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.universetoday.com/2008/03/24/does-a-boomerang-work-in-space/ |title= Does a Boomerang Work in Space? |publisher= Universetoday.com |date= 2008-03-24 |accessdate= 3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hunting ==
It is thought by some that the shape and elliptical flight path of the returning boomerang makes it useful for hunting birds and small animals, or that noise generated by the movement of the boomerang through the air, or, by a skilled thrower, lightly clipping leaves of a tree whose branches house birds, would help scare the birds towards the thrower. It is further supposed by some that this was used to frighten flocks or groups of birds into nets that were usually strung up between trees or thrown by hidden hunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lloyd |first1= John |last2= Mitchinson |first2= John |title= The Book of General Ignorance |year=2006 |publisher= Mackays of Chatham |isbn= 978-0-571-23368-7 |page= 244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In southeastern [[Australia]], it is claimed that boomerangs were made to hover over a flock of ducks; mistaking it for a hawk, the ducks would dive away, toward hunters armed with nets or clubs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite these notions and similar claims by a few European writers, there is no independently contemporaneous record of any aboriginal peoples using a returning boomerang as a weapon.{{cn|date=October 2018}}}

Traditionally, most boomerangs used by aboriginal groups in Australia were 'non-returning'. These weapons, sometimes called "throwsticks" or "kylies", were used for hunting a variety of prey, from [[kangaroo]]s to parrots; at a range of about {{convert|100|m}}, a 2-kg (4.4 lb) non-returning boomerang could inflict mortal injury to a large animal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A throwstick thrown nearly horizontally may fly in a nearly straight path and could fell a kangaroo on impact to the legs or knees, while the long-necked emu could be killed by a blow to the neck.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  Hooked non-returning boomerangs, known as "beaked kylies", used in northern Central Australia, have been claimed to kill multiple birds when thrown into a dense flock. It should be noted that throwsticks are used as multi-purpose tools by today's aboriginal peoples, and besides throwing could be wielded as clubs, used for digging, used to start friction fires, and are sonorous when two are struck together.

== Design ==
[[File:Boomerangs - melbourne show 2005.jpg |thumb|left|Boomerangs for sale at the 2005 Melbourne Show]]

A returning boomerang is a rotating wing. Although it is not a requirement that the boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat. A falling boomerang starts spinning, and most then fall in a spiral. When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, a boomerang flies in a curve rather than a straight line. When thrown correctly, a boomerang returns to its starting point.

Returning boomerangs consist of two or more arms, or wings, connected at an angle. Each wing is shaped as an [[airfoil]].

As the wing rotates and the boomerang moves through the air, this creates airflow over the wings and this creates lift on both "wings". However, during one-half of each blade's rotation, it sees a higher airspeed, because the rotation tip-speed and the forward speed add, and when it is in the other half of the rotation, the tip speed subtracts from the forward speed. Thus if thrown nearly upright each blade generates more lift at the top than the bottom.&lt;ref name=hyper&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/brng.html |title= Boomerang |work=gsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it might be expected that this would cause the boomerang to tilt around the axis of travel, because the boomerang has significant angular momentum, gyroscopic effect causes the plane of rotation to tilt about an axis that is 90 degrees to the direction of flight, and this is what curves the flight in such a way that it will tend to return.&lt;ref name=hyper/&gt;

Thus [[gyroscopic precession]] is what makes the boomerang return to the thrower when thrown correctly. This is also what makes the boomerang fly straight up into the air when thrown incorrectly. With the exception of long-distance boomerangs, they should not be thrown sidearm or like a [[Flying disc|Frisbee]], but rather thrown with the long axis of the wings rotating in an almost-vertical plane.

Fast Catch boomerangs usually have three or more symmetrical wings (seen from above), whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped similar to a question mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.baggressive.com/copper/thumbnails.php?album=6 |title= 'baggressive.com' |publisher= Baggressive.com |date= 19 April 2005 |accessdate= 3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs mostly have one wing considerably longer than the other. This feature, along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings help to set up an 'auto-rotation' effect to maximise the boomerang's hover-time in descending from the highest point in its flight.

Some boomerangs have [[turbulator]]s—bumps or pits on the top surface that act to increase the lift as boundary layer transition activators (to keep attached turbulent flow instead of laminar separation).

=== Modern construction ===
&lt;!-- Much of this section is written as if it is a how-to article, and may also be a possible cut-and-paste move that was slightly edited. This section should be edited to conform to a proper encyclopedic style. --&gt;
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}

The pattern is placed on the plywood so that the wood grain runs across from the tip of one end of the boomerang to the tip of the other end. Try to get the grain of the outer ply running at 45 degrees to the length of the arms.  If there is any warp in the wood, make sure that this produces dihedral on the upper side of the boomerang, i.e., if the airfoil is uppermost and the boomerang is on a flat surface, then the wingtips are raised slightly above the surface.  (Any anhedral and the boomerang won't fly.) The pattern is traced on to the boomerang with a pencil. The boomerang shape is cut out of the plywood. This basic cut out is called the blank. An outline is drawn on the top of the blank to show the areas to be shaped for the leading and trailing edges of the wings. The profiles of the wings are shaped. The top of the leading edge of each wing is decreased at a 45° angle, while the rear of the wing is angled down to leave 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm thick trailing edge. The bottom face of the leading edge is trimmed back slightly. The tips of the wings are shaped down to the same thickness as the trailing edge. The various layers of the plywood serve as an outline that helps the worker achieve equal slopes. A shallow section may also be cut out from the bottom surface of each wing. For example, this might consist of a 5-cm long strip near the wing tip and behind the leading edge. Using progressively finer sandpaper, the surface of the boomerang is smoothed carefully.  Check the boomerang for a slight amount of dihedral (2–3&amp;nbsp;mm) on both wings at this point.  If there isn't any, introduce some by heating the boomerang either over a heat source or a brief spell in the microwave oven (about 30 seconds on high) – if the boomerang is just about uncomfortably hot to handle, you've got it just about right.  Bend up the tips of the wings and place the boomerang on a flat surface with a coin under each tip and a weight (bag of sugar?) on the elbow of the boomerang.  Allow it to cool for twenty minutes or more.  After spraying the surface with sanding sealer, the surface is smoothed with fine steel wool. The boomerang is then painted again.

=== Tuning the flight ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
The boomerang is then thrown several times to check if it works. The extreme subtleties of the [[aerodynamic]] forces on the light wooden boomerang make it surprisingly difficult to predict how the finished boomerang will perform. Two apparently identical boomerangs may radically differ in their flight patterns. For example, they may climb uncontrollably, they may fall repeatedly into the ground, they may exhibit long narrow pattern non-returning flight, or display other erratic behaviour. The only sure way to know is to flight-test them. There are several methods to correct problems, for example the wing profiles might be adjusted by additional sanding. Plywood boomerangs may be heated for a short time in a [[microwave oven]] which softens the glue between the layers and then can be carefully intentionally warped. [[Angle of attack]] of the leading arm and the dingle arm can be adjusted, as can the overall [[dihedral angle]] of the wings all with some effect. There are many other esoteric tuning techniques as well. Tuning boomerangs is more of a slowly learned art than a science. The quality of the boomerang is also checked throughout this process. A tuned boomerang should be stored carefully on a flat surface away from too much humidity, direct sunlight, or heat. These conditions can subtly affect the shape of the boomerang and ruin its flight characteristics, and the boomerang will then need to be re-tuned.

The hunting boomerang is more delicately balanced and is therefore much harder to make than a returning one. When thrown, this type of boomerang needs to develop no unbalanced aerodynamic forces that would affect its flight path, so that it will fly true to the target.

=== Art renaissance ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Beginning in the later part of the twentieth century, there has been a bloom in the independent creation of unusually designed art boomerangs. These often have little or no resemblance to the traditional historical ones and on first sight some of these objects often do not look like boomerangs at all. The use of modern thin plywoods and synthetic plastics have greatly contributed to their success. As long as there are somewhere in the object several airfoil contoured surfaces, whether wing shaped or not, these boomerangs can be thrown and will return. Designs are amazingly diverse and can range from animal inspired forms, humorous themes, complex calligraphic and symbolic shapes, to the purely abstract. Painted surfaces are similarly richly diverse.

== Throwing technique ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
A right-handed boomerang is thrown with a counter-clockwise spin causing a counter-clockwise flight (as seen from above). Conversely, a left-handed boomerang is constructed as a mirror image with the aerofoils' leading edges on the left side of the wings, as seen from above, causing it to produce lift when circling clockwise. Although appearing symmetrical from a plan view, the leading edges are on opposite edges of the wings (leading and trailing) so as to present the leading edges of the aerofoil to the wind when spinning.
[[File:Boomerang School.JPG|thumb|right|A boomerang school, William Street, Kings Cross, Sydney]]

Most sport boomerangs are in the range of about {{convert|70|to|110|g|oz}}. The range on most is between {{cvt|20|and|40|m|yd|0}}. Boomerangs are generally thrown in treeless, large open spaces that are twice as large as the range of the boomerang. A right- or left-handed boomerang can be thrown with either hand, but the flight direction will depend upon the boomerang, not the thrower. Throwing a boomerang with the wrong hand requires a throwing motion that many throwers may find awkward.

The correct launch orientation makes the boomerang's flight begin by flying into the wind, then having its flight take it through the "eye of the wind" and finally returning downwind using the wind's speed to help complete its flight back to the thrower. It is the spin that makes the boomerang return and the strength of throw and spin must be varied according to the speed of the wind – the stronger the wind, the less power is required to provide lift enough to make the return journey. In other words, the stronger the wind, the softer the boomerang is thrown. A light wind of three to five miles per hour is considered ideal. If the wind is strong enough to fly a kite, then it is usually too strong for boomerangs.

A properly thrown boomerang should curve around to the left, climb gently, level out in mid-flight, arc around and descend slowly, and then finish by popping up slightly, hovering, then stalling near the thrower. Ideally, this momentary hovering or stalling will allow the catcher the opportunity to clamp their hands shut horizontally on the boomerang from above and below, sandwiching the centre between their hands.

== Competitions and records ==

In international competition, a ''world cup'' is held every second year. {{as of|2017}}, teams from Germany and the United States dominated international competition. The individual World Champion title was won in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2012 and 2016 by Swiss thrower [[Manuel Schütz]]. In 1992, 1998, 2006 and 2008 [[Fridolin Frost]] from Germany won the title.

The team competitions of 2012 and 2014 were won by Boomergang (an international team). World champions were Germany in 2012 and Japan in 2014 for the first time. Boomergang was formed by individuals from several countries, including the Colombian [[Alejandro Palacio]]. In 2016 USA became team world champion.

=== Competition disciplines ===

Modern boomerang tournaments usually involve some or all of the events listed below&lt;ref name="German Wikipedia"&gt;Based on original text from German wiki.[[:de:Bumerang]]{{Better source|date=November 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all disciplines the boomerang must travel at least {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} from the thrower. Throwing takes place individually. The thrower stands at the centre of concentric rings marked on an open field.

Events include:

* ''Aussie Round'': considered by many to be the ultimate test of boomeranging skills. The boomerang should ideally cross the {{convert|50|m|ft|adj=on}} circle and come right back to the centre. Each thrower has five attempts. Points are awarded for distance, accuracy and the catch.
* ''Accuracy'': points are awarded according to how close the boomerang lands to the centre of the rings. The thrower must not touch the boomerang after it has been thrown. Each thrower has five attempts. In major competitions there are two accuracy disciplines: Accuracy 100 and Accuracy 50.
* ''Endurance'': points are awarded for the number of catches achieved in 5 minutes.
* ''Fast Catch'': the time taken to throw and catch the boomerang five times. The winner has the fastest timed catches.
* ''Trick Catch/Doubling'': points are awarded for trick catches behind the back, between the feet, and so on. In Doubling the thrower has to throw two boomerangs at the same time and catch them in sequence in a special way.
* ''Consecutive Catch'': points are awarded for the number of catches achieved before the boomerang is dropped. The event is not timed.
* ''MTA 100'' (''Maximal Time Aloft'', {{convert|100|m|ft|0}}): points are awarded for the length of time spent by the boomerang in the air. The field is normally a circle measuring 100&amp;nbsp;m. An alternative to this discipline, without the 100&amp;nbsp;m restriction is called ''MTA unlimited''.
* ''Long Distance'': the boomerang is thrown from the middle point of a {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=on}} baseline. The furthest distance travelled by the boomerang away from the baseline is measured. On returning, the boomerang must cross the baseline again but does not have to be caught. A special section is dedicated to LD below.
* ''Juggling'': as with Consecutive Catch, only with two boomerangs. At any given time one boomerang must be in the air.

=== Guinness World Record - Smallest Returning Boomerang ===

''Non-discipline record'': Smallest Returning Boomerang: Sadir Kattan of Australia in 1997 with {{convert|1.9|in|mm}} long and {{convert|1.8|in|mm}} wide. This tiny boomerang flew the required {{convert|22|yd|m}}, before returning to the accuracy circles on 22 March 1997 at the Australian National Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boomerang.org.au/wp/photos/boomerangs/boomerangs-sadir-kattan-and-worlds-smallest-boomerang/ |title=World's smallest boomerang |publisher=www.boomerang.org.au |date=12 April 2008 |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guinness World Record - Longest Throw of Any Object by a Human ===

A boomerang was used to set a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] with a throw of 1,401.5 feet (427.2 metres) by David Schummy on [[Portal:Current events/2005 March 15|15 March 2005]] at [[Murrarie Recreation Ground]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|LQ5dW5pHPYk|Longest Boomerang Throw}}&lt;/ref&gt; This broke the record set by Erin Hemmings who threw an [[Aerobie]] 1,333 feet (406.3 metres) on 14 July 2003 at [[Fort Funston]], San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First quarter Mile Throw in History at Fort Funston |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2003_July_16/ai_105504992/ |agency=[[Business Wire]] |date=16 July 2003 |accessdate=28 May 2009 |work=Business Wire }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-distance boomerang throwers aim to have the boomerang go the furthest possible distance while returning close to the throwing point. In competition the boomerang must intersect an imaginary surface defined as an [[infinity|infinite]] [[Vertical angles|vertical]] [[extrusion|extrude]] of a {{convert|40|m|yd|adj=on}} large line centred on the thrower. Outside of competitions, the definition is not so strict, and the thrower is happy whenever he/she does not have to travel {{convert|50|m|yd}} after the throw, to recover the boomerang.

=== General properties ===
Long-distance boomerangs are optimised to have minimal drag while still having enough lift to fly and return. For this reason, they have a very narrow throwing window, which discourages many beginners from continuing with this discipline. For the same reason, the quality of manufactured long-distance boomerangs is often non-deterministic.

Today's long-distance boomerangs have almost all an ''S'' or ''? – question mark'' shape and have a [[bevel]]ed edge on both sides (the bevel on the bottom side is sometimes called an undercut). This is to minimise drag and lower the lift. Lift must be low because the boomerang is thrown with an almost total layover (flat). Long-distance boomerangs are most frequently made of composite material, mainly fibre glass [[epoxy]] composites.

=== Flight path ===
The projection of the flight path of long-distance boomerang on the ground resembles a [[Drop (liquid)|water drop]]. For older types of long-distance boomerangs (all types of so-called big hooks), the first and last third of the flight path are very low, while the middle third is a fast climb followed by a fast descent. Nowadays, boomerangs are made in a way that their whole flight path is almost planar with a constant climb during the first half of the trajectory and then a rather constant descent during the second half.

From theoretical point of view, distance boomerangs are interesting also for the following reason: for achieving a different behaviour during different flight phases, the ratio of the rotation frequency to the forward velocity has a U-shaped function, i.e., its [[derivative]] crosses 0. Practically, it means that the boomerang being at the furthest point has a very low forward velocity. The [[kinetic energy]] of the forward component is then stored in the [[potential energy]]. This is not true for other types of boomerangs, where the loss of kinetic energy is non-reversible (the MTAs also store kinetic energy in potential energy during the first half of the flight, but then the potential energy is lost directly by the drag).

== Related terms ==
In [[Noongar language]], ''kylie'' is a flat curved piece of wood similar in appearance to a boomerang that is thrown when hunting for birds and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Language {{!}} Kaartdijin Noongar |url= https://www.noongarculture.org.au/language/ |website= www.noongarculture.org.au |publisher= SWLASC |accessdate= 6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Kylie" is one of the Aboriginal words for the hunting stick used in warfare and for hunting animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bumerang-sport.de/story/history.htm|title=Whence comes, and what is a boomerang|website=www.bumerang-sport.de|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of following curved flight paths, kylies fly in straight lines from the throwers. They are typically much larger than boomerangs, and can travel very long distances; due to their size and hook shapes, they can cripple or kill an animal or human opponent. The word is perhaps an English corruption of a word meaning "boomerang" taken from one of the Western Desert languages, for example, the [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] word "karli".

The '''chemical industry''' comprises the [[company|companies]] that produce industrial [[chemical]]s. Central to the modern [[world economy]], it converts [[raw materials]] ([[oil]], [[natural gas]], [[air]], [[water]], [[metals]], and [[minerals]]) into more than 70,000 different [[Products Finishing|products]].

The [[plastics industry]] contains some overlap, as most chemical companies produce plastic as well as other chemicals.

==History==
Although chemicals were made and used throughout history, the birth of the heavy chemical industry (production of chemicals in large quantities for a variety of uses) coincided with the beginnings of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in general.

===Industrial Revolution===
One of the first chemicals to be produced in large amounts through industrial processes was [[sulphuric acid]]. In 1736, the pharmacist [[Joshua Ward]] developed a process for its production that involved heating saltpeter, allowing the sulfur to oxidize and combine with water. It was the first practical production of sulphuric acid on a large scale. [[John Roebuck]] and [[Samuel Garbett]] were the first to establish a large-scale factory in [[Prestonpans|Prestonpans, Scotland]], in 1749, which used leaden condensing chambers for the manufacture of sulfuric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Derry, Thomas Kingston |author2=Williams, Trevor I. | year = 1993 | title = A Short History of Technology: From the Earliest Times to A.D. 1900 | location = New York | publisher = Dover }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sulfuric Acid: Pumping Up the Volume | author = Kiefer, David M. | year = 2001 | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/tcaw/10/i09/html/09chemch.html | accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Tennant]]'s St. Rollox Chemical Works in 1831, then the biggest chemical enterprise in the world.]]
In the early [[18th century]], cloth was bleached by treating it with stale [[urine]] or [[sour milk]] and exposing it to [[sunlight]] for long periods of time, which created a severe bottleneck in production. Sulfuric acid began to be used as a more efficient agent as well as [[lime (material)|lime]] by the middle of the century, but it was the discovery of [[bleaching powder]] by [[Charles Tennant]] that spurred the creation of the first great chemical industrial enterprise. His powder was made by reacting [[chlorine]] with dry [[slaked lime]] and proved to be a cheap and successful product. He opened a factory in [[Glasgow St Rollox (UK Parliament constituency)|St Rollox]], north of [[Glasgow]], and production went from just 52 tons in 1799 to almost 10,000 tons just five years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Chemical Industries In The UK|publisher = American Chemical Society|url=http://the-environment.org.uk/bristish_isles/history_chemical_industry_UK.html|accessdate = 2013-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Soda ash]] was used since ancient times in the production of [[glass]], [[textile]], [[soap]], and [[paper]], and the source of the [[potash]] had traditionally been [[wood]] ashes in [[Western Europe]]. By the 18th century, this source was becoming uneconomical due to deforestation, and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] offered a prize of 2400 [[French livre|livres]] for a method to produce alkali from sea salt ([[sodium chloride]]). The [[Leblanc process]] was patented in 1791 by [[Nicolas Leblanc]] who then built a Leblanc plant at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]].&lt;ref name="Aftalion11"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Fred | last = Aftalion | title = A History of the International Chemical Industry | location = Philadelphia | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1991 | pages = 11–13 | isbn = 0-8122-1297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was denied his prize money because of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name='Aftalion14'/&gt;

However, it was in Britain that the Leblanc process really took off.&lt;ref name='Aftalion14'&gt;{{Cite book | first = Fred | last = Aftalion | title = A History of the International Chemical Industry | location = Philadelphia | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1991 | pages = 14–16 | isbn = 0-8122-1297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Losh]] built the first soda works in Britain at the [[Losh, Wilson and Bell]] works on the [[River Tyne]] in 1816, but it remained on a small scale due to large [[tariff]]s on salt production until 1824. When these tariffs were repealed, the British soda industry was able to rapidly expand. [[James Muspratt]]'s chemical works in [[Liverpool]] and Charles Tennant's complex near [[Glasgow]] became the largest chemical production centres anywhere. By the 1870s, the British soda output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined.

[[File:Ernest Solvay.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Ernest Solvay]], patented an improved industrial method for the manufacture of [[soda ash]].]]
These huge factories began to produce a greater diversity of chemicals as the [[Industrial Revolution]] matured. Originally, large quantities of alkaline waste were vented into the environment from the production of soda, provoking one of the [[Alkali Act 1863|first pieces of environmental legislation]] to be passed in 1863. This provided for close inspection of the factories and imposed heavy fines on those exceeding the limits on pollution. Methods were soon devised to make useful byproducts from the alkali.

The [[Solvay process]] was developed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] industrial chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] in 1861. In 1864, Solvay and his brother Alfred constructed a plant in the Belgian town of [[Charleroi]] and in 1874, they expanded into a larger plant in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France. The new process proved more economical and less polluting than the Leblanc method, and its use spread. In the same year, [[Ludwig Mond]] visited Solvay to acquire the rights to use his process, and he and [[John Tomlinson Brunner|John Brunner]] formed the firm of [[Brunner Mond|Brunner, Mond &amp; Co.]], and built a Solvay plant at [[Winnington]], England. Mond was instrumental in making the Solvay process a commercial success; he made several refinements between 1873 and 1880 that removed byproducts that could slow or halt the mass production of sodium carbonate through use of the process.

===Expansion and maturation===
The late [[19th century]] saw an explosion in both the quantity of production and the variety of chemicals that were manufactured. Large chemical industries also took shape in Germany and later in the United States.

[[File:BASF Werk Ludwigshafen 1866.JPG|thumb|right|The factories of the German firm [[BASF]], in 1866.]]
Production of artificial manufactured [[fertilizer]] for [[agriculture]] was pioneered by Sir [[John Lawes]] at his purpose-built [[Rothamsted Research]] facility. In the 1840s he established large works near [[London]] for the manufacture of [[Monocalcium phosphate|superphosphate of lime]]. Processes for the [[vulcanization of rubber]] were patented by [[Charles Goodyear]] in the United States and [[Thomas Hancock (inventor)|Thomas Hancock]] in England in the 1840s. The first synthetic dye was discovered by [[William Henry Perkin]] in [[London]]. He partly transformed [[aniline]] into a crude mixture which, when extracted with alcohol, produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He also developed the first synthetic perfumes. However, it was German industry that quickly began to dominate the field of synthetic dyes. The three major firms [[BASF]], [[Bayer AG|Bayer]] and [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] produced several hundred different dyes, and by 1913, the German industry produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aftalion|1991|p=104}}, {{Harvnb|Chandler|2004|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[Herbert Henry Dow|Herbert Henry Dow's]] use of electrochemistry to produce chemicals from [[brine]] was a commercial success that helped to promote the country's chemical industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bromineproduction.html|title=Electrolytic Production of Bromine - National Historic Chemical Landmark - American Chemical Society|website=American Chemical Society|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[petrochemical]] industry can be traced back to the oil works of [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] in Scotland and [[Abraham Pineo Gesner]] in Canada. The first plastic was invented by [[Alexander Parkes]], an English [[metallurgy|metallurgist]]. In 1856, he patented [[Parkesine]], a [[celluloid]] based on [[nitrocellulose]] treated with a variety of solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=UK Patent office|title=Patents for inventions|year=1857|publisher=UK Patent office|pages=255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nCoU-2tAx8C&amp;pg=PA255}}&lt;/ref&gt; This material, exhibited at the 1862 London International Exhibition, anticipated many of the modern aesthetic and utility uses of plastics. The industrial production of [[soap]] from vegetable oils was started by [[William Lever]] and his brother [[James Darcy Lever|James]] in 1885 in [[Lancashire]] based on a modern chemical process invented by William Hough Watson that used [[glycerin]] and [[vegetable oil]]s.&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;Jeannifer Filly Sumayku, [http://www.thepresidentpost.com/?p=2621 Unilever: Providing Enjoyable and Meaningful Life to Customers], ''The President Post, 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1920s, chemical firms consolidated into large [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s; [[IG Farben]] in Germany, [[Rhône-Poulenc]] in France and [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] in Britain. [[DuPont|Dupont]] became a major chemicals firm in the early 20th century in America.

Currently chemical production is a high-tech industry, where the competitiveness is more based on capacity in investment on research and development than the labour cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Gabriele |last= Centi|title=Resources and energy efficiency :the winning strategy for chemical industry |journal=La Chimica  l'Industria |publisher=Società Chimica Italiana|url=https://www.soc.chim.it/sites/default/files/chimind/pdf/2012_1_64_ca.pdf|issue=  1|date = January 2012|pages=64–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
"Polymers and plastics, especially [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[polyethylene terephthalate]], [[polystyrene]] and [[polycarbonate]] comprise about 80% of the industry’s output worldwide".&lt;ref name=Chemistry&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry in Daily Life|last=Singh|first=Kirpal|publisher=PHI Learning Private Limited|isbn=978-81-203-4617-8|date=July 2012|page=132|chapter=17.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These materials are often converted to [[fluoropolymer]] tubing products and used by the industry to transport highly corrosive materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fluorotherm.com/technical-information/materials-overview/ptfe-properties/|title=PTFE Properties|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Fluorotherm Polymers, Inc.|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemicals are used in a lot of different consumer goods, but they are also used in a lot of different other sectors; including agriculture manufacturing, construction, and service industries.&lt;ref name=Chemistry /&gt; Major industrial customers include rubber and [[plastic]] products, [[textile]]s, apparel, petroleum refining, [[paper chemicals|pulp and paper]], and primary metals. Chemicals are nearly a $3 trillion global enterprise, and the EU and U.S. chemical companies are the world's largest producers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Sales of the chemical business can be divided into a few broad categories, including basic chemicals (about 35 to 37 percent of the dollar output), life sciences (30 percent), specialty chemicals (20 to 25 percent) and consumer products (about 10 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Technofunc|title=Sectors of Chemical Industry|url=http://www.technofunc.com/index.php/domain-knowledge/chemicals-industry/item/sectors-of-chemical-industry|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic Chemicals &amp; Commodity Chemicals to Polymers and Specialty Chemicals===

[[File:Slovnaft - new polypropylene plant PP3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|New polypropylene plant PP3 in the [[Slovnaft]] oil refinery ([[Bratislava]], Slovakia)]]
Basic chemicals, or "commodity chemicals" are a broad chemical category including polymers, bulk petrochemicals and intermediates, other derivatives and basic industrials, [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic chemicals]], and [[fertilizer]]s. Typical growth rates for basic chemicals are about 0.5 to 0.7 times GDP.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Product prices are generally less than fifty cents per pound.{Citation needed|date=May 2010}

'''Polymers''', the largest revenue segment at about 33 percent of the basic chemicals dollar value, includes all categories of [[plastics industry|plastics]] and man-made fibers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The major markets for plastics are [[packaging]], followed by home construction, containers, appliances, pipe, transportation, toys, and games. 
* The largest-volume polymer product, [[polyethylene]] (PE), is used mainly in packaging films and other markets such as milk bottles, containers, and pipe.
* [[Polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), another large-volume product, is principally used to make piping for construction markets as well as siding and, to a much smaller extent, transportation and packaging materials.
* [[Polypropylene]] (PP), similar in volume to PVC, is used in markets ranging from packaging, appliances, and containers to clothing and carpeting.
* [[Polystyrene]] (PS), another large-volume plastic, is used principally for appliances and packaging as well as toys and recreation.
* The leading [[synthetic fiber|man-made fibers]] include [[polyester]], [[nylon]], polypropylene, and [[Acrylic fiber|acrylics]], with applications including apparel, home furnishings, and other industrial and consumer use.
The principal raw materials for polymers are bulk petrochemicals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Chemicals in the bulk '''[[petrochemicals]]''' and intermediates are primarily made from [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG), [[natural gas]], and [[crude oil]]. Their sales volume is close to 30 percent of overall basic chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} 
Typical large-volume products include [[ethylene]], [[propylene]], [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[xylenes]], [[methanol]], [[vinyl chloride monomer]] (VCM), [[styrene]], [[butadiene]], and [[ethylene oxide]]. These basic or commodity chemicals are the starting materials used to manufacture many [[polymer]]s and other more complex organic chemicals particularly those that are made for use in the [[specialty chemicals]] category (see below).

'''Other derivatives''' and basic industrials include [[synthetic rubber]], [[surfactant]]s, [[dye]]s and [[pigment]]s, [[turpentine]], [[resin]]s, [[carbon black]], [[explosive]]s, and rubber products and contribute about 20 percent of the basic chemicals' external sales.

'''[[inorganic chemistry|Inorganic chemicals]]''' (about 12 percent of the revenue output) make up the oldest of the chemical categories. Products include [[salt]], [[chlorine]], [[caustic soda]], [[soda ash]], acids (such as [[nitric acid]], [[phosphoric acid]], and [[sulfuric acid]]), [[titanium dioxide]], and [[hydrogen peroxide]].

'''[[Fertilizers]]''' are the smallest category (about 6 percent) and include [[phosphate]]s, [[ammonia]], and [[potash]] chemicals.

===Life sciences===
Life sciences (about 30 percent of the dollar output of the chemistry business) include differentiated chemical and biological substances, [[pharmaceutical]]s, diagnostics, [[veterinary medicine|animal health products]], [[vitamin]]s, and [[pesticides]]. While much smaller in volume than other chemical sectors, their products tend to have very high prices—over ten dollars per pound—growth rates of 1.5 to 6 times GDP, and research and development spending at 15 to 25 percent of sales. Life science products are usually produced with very high specifications and are closely scrutinized by government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration. Pesticides, also called "crop protection chemicals", are about 10 percent of this category and include [[herbicides]], [[insecticide]]s, and [[fungicide]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Specialty chemicals===
[[Specialty chemicals]] are a category of relatively high valued, rapidly growing chemicals with diverse end product markets. Typical growth rates are one to three times GDP with prices over a dollar per pound. They are generally characterized by their innovative aspects. Products are sold for what they can do rather than for what chemicals they contain. Products include electronic chemicals, [[industrial gases]], adhesives and sealants as well as coatings, industrial and institutional cleaning chemicals, and catalysts. In 2012, excluding fine chemicals, the $546 billion global speciality chemical market was 33% Paints, Coating and Surface Treatments, 27% Advanced Polymer, 14% Adhesives and Sealants, 13% additives and 13% pigments and inks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher==Marketline|title=Global Specialty Chemicals|url=http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|date=May 2012|accessdate=16 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115071331/http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|archivedate=15 November 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Speciality chemicals]] are sold as effect or performance chemicals. Sometimes they are mixtures of formulations, unlike "[[fine chemicals]]," which are almost always single-molecule products.

===Consumer products===
Consumer products include direct product sale of chemicals such as [[soap]]s, [[detergent]]s, and [[cosmetics]]. Typical growth rates are 0.8 to 1.0 times GDP.

Consumers rarely if ever come into contact with basic chemicals but polymers and speciality chemicals are the materials that they will encounter everywhere in their everyday lives, such as in plastics, cleaning materials, cosmetics, paints &amp; coatings, electronic gadgets, automobiles and the materials used to construct their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=MarketLine|title=Global Speciality Chemicals|url=http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|date=May 2012|access-date=2012-09-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115071331/http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|archivedate=2012-11-15|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These speciality products are marketed by chemical companies to the downstream manufacturing industries as [[pesticides]], [[Polymers|speciality polymers]], electronic chemicals, [[surfactants]], construction chemicals, Industrial Cleaners, [[flavours]] and [[fragrances]], speciality coatings, printing inks, water-soluble polymers, [[food additives]], [[paper chemicals]], oil field chemicals, plastic adhesives, [[adhesives]] and [[sealants]], [[Cosmetic ingredients|cosmetic chemicals]], [[Water treatment|water management chemicals]], [[catalysts]], textile chemicals.

Every year, the [[American Chemistry Council]] tabulates the U.S. production volume of the top 100 chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-tTWNufb3wC&amp;pg=PA379&amp;lpg=PA379&amp;dq=Every+year,+the+American+Chemistry+Council+tabulates+the+U.S.+production+volume+of+the+top+100+chemicals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oghc5shhcD&amp;sig=-o3fTx4ZfLPxIGxuBcvCgg7sZXE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5nKWf2v3YAhWo44MKHa2mC38Q6AEIPTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Every%20year,%20the%20American%20Chemistry%20Council%20tabulates%20the%20U.S.%20production%20volume%20of%20the%20top%20100%20chemicals&amp;f=false|title=Chemistry|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2000, the aggregate production volume of the top 100 chemicals totalled 502 million tons, up from 397 million tons in 1990. 
Inorganic chemicals tend to be the largest volume, though much smaller in dollar revenue terms due to their low prices. The top 11 of the 100 chemicals in 2000 were [[sulfuric acid]] (44 million tons), [[nitrogen]] (34), [[ethylene]] (28), [[oxygen]] (27), [[Lime (material)|lime]] (22), [[ammonia]] (17), [[propylene]] (16), [[polyethylene]] (15), [[chlorine]] (13), [[phosphoric acid]] (13) and [[diammonium phosphate]]s (12).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-tTWNufb3wC&amp;pg=PA379&amp;lpg=PA379&amp;dq=The+top+11+of+the+100+chemicals+in+2000+were+sulfuric+acid+(44+million+tons),+nitrogen+(34),+ethylene+(28),+oxygen+(27),+lime+(22),+ammonia+(17),+propylene+(16),+polyethylene+(15),+chlorine+(13),+phosphoric+acid+(13)+and+diammonium+phosphates&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oghc5shn3D&amp;sig=D8nl9Hp1kPzKBtgFXCx7Rk5XXsY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjInJmS3P3YAhVp5IMKHdb7BW4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20top%2011%20of%20the%20100%20chemicals%20in%202000%20were%20sulfuric%20acid%20(44%20million%20tons),%20nitrogen%20(34),%20ethylene%20(28),%20oxygen%20(27),%20lime%20(22),%20ammonia%20(17),%20propylene%20(16),%20polyethylene%20(15),%20chlorine%20(13),%20phosphoric%20acid%20(13)%20and%20diammonium%20phosphates&amp;f=false|title=Chemistry|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Turbine generator systems1.png|thumb|This is a process diagram of a turbine generator. Engineers working to produce a sustainable process for use in the chemical industry need to know how to design a sustainable process in which the system can withstand or manipulate process-halting conditions such as heat, friction, pressure, emissions, and contaminants.]]

From the perspective of chemical engineers, the chemical industry involves the use of [[chemical process]]es such as [[chemical reaction]]s and [[refining]] methods to produce a wide variety of solid, liquid, and gaseous materials.  Most of these products serve to [[Manufacturing|manufacture]] other items, although a smaller number go directly to consumers.  [[Solvent]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[lye]], [[sodium carbonate|washing soda]], and [[portland cement]] provide a few examples of product used by consumers.

The industry includes manufacturers of [[inorganic]]- and [[Organic chemistry|organic]]-industrial chemicals, ceramic products, petrochemicals, agrochemicals,  polymers and rubber (elastomers), oleochemicals (oils, fats, and waxes), explosives, fragrances and flavors.  Examples of these products are shown in the Table below.

Although the [[pharmaceutical]] industry is often considered{{Who|date=November 2010}} a '''chemical industry ''', it has many different characteristics that puts it in a separate category.  Other closely related industries include [[petroleum]], [[glass]], [[paint]], [[ink]], [[sealant]], [[adhesive]], and [[food processing]] manufacturers.

Chemical processes such as chemical reactions operate in [[chemical plant]]s to form new substances in various types of reaction vessels.  In many cases the reactions take place in special corrosion-resistant equipment at elevated temperatures and pressures with the use of [[catalyst]]s. The products of these reactions are separated using a variety of techniques including [[distillation]] especially [[fractional distillation]], [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], [[crystallization]], [[adsorption]], [[filtration]], [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], and [[drying]].

The processes and product or products are usually tested during and after manufacture by dedicated instruments and on-site [[quality control]] [[Laboratory|laboratories]] to ensure safe operation and to assure that the product will meet required [[specification]]s. More organizations within the industry are implementing chemical compliance software to maintain quality products and [[manufacturing]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemical and Agrochemical Enterprise Quality Management Software|url=http://www.spartasystems.com/industries/other-industries/chemical-and-agrochemical/|publisher=Sparta Systems, Inc.|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The products are packaged and delivered by many methods, including pipelines, tank-cars, and tank-trucks (for both solids and liquids), cylinders, drums, bottles, and boxes.  Chemical companies often have a [[research-and-development]] laboratory for developing and testing products and processes.  These facilities may include pilot plants, and such research facilities may be located at a site separate from the production plant(s).

==World Chemical Production ==
[[File:Colonne distillazione.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Distillation columns]]
The scale of chemical manufacturing tends to be organized from largest in volume ([[petrochemical]]s and [[commodity chemicals]]), to [[specialty chemicals]], and the smallest, [[fine chemicals]].

The petrochemical and commodity chemical manufacturing units are on the whole single product continuous processing plants. Not all petrochemical or commodity chemical materials are made in one single location, but groups of related materials often are to induce industrial symbiosis as well as material, energy and utility efficiency and other economies of scale.

Those chemicals made on the largest of scales are made in a few manufacturing locations around the world, for example in [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]] along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] of the [[United States]], on [[Teesside]] in the [[Northeast of England]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and in [[Rotterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The large scale manufacturing locations often have clusters of manufacturing units that share utilities and large scale infrastructure such as [[power stations]], [[Port|port facilities]], road and rail terminals. To demonstrate the clustering and integration mentioned above, some 50% of the United Kingdom's petrochemical and commodity chemicals are produced by the [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] on [[Teesside]].
 
Specialty chemical and fine chemical manufacturing are mostly made in discrete batch processes. These manufacturers are often found in similar locations but in many cases they are to be found in multi sector business parks.

===Continents and Countries===
In the U.S. there are 170 major chemical companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6trCF6poRSQC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=In+the+U.S.+there+are+170+major+chemical+companies.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLyrPv3P3YAhUC7YMKHX3eD3IQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20the%20U.S.%20there%20are%20170%20major%20chemical%20companies.&amp;f=false|title=CHEMISTRY IN DAILY LIFE|last=SINGH|first=KIRPAL|date=2012-07-07|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788120346178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;They operate internationally with more than 2,800 facilities outside the U.S. and 1,700 foreign subsidiaries or affiliates operating. The U.S. chemical output is $750 billion a year.  The U.S. industry records large trade surpluses and employs more than a million people in the United States alone. The chemical industry is also the second largest consumer of energy in manufacturing and spends over $5 billion annually on pollution abatement.

In Europe the chemical, plastics and rubber sectors are among the largest industrial sectors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Together they generate about 3.2 million jobs in more than 60,000 companies. Since 2000 the chemical sector alone has represented 2/3 of the entire manufacturing trade surplus of the EU.

in 2012 The chemical sector accounted for 12% of the EU manufacturing industry's added value. Europe remains world’s biggest chemical trading region with 43% of the world’s exports and 37%of the world’s imports, although the latest data shows that Asia is catching up with 34% of the exports and 37% of imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=CEFIC|title=Facts and Figures 2012:The European chemicals industry in a worldwide perspective|url=http://www.cefic.org/Documents/FactsAndFigures/2012/Facts-and-Figures-2012-The-Brochure.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Europe still has a trading surplus with all regions of the world except Japan and China where in 2011 there was a chemical trade balance. Europe’s trade surplus with the rest of the world today amounts to 41.7 billion Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stan|last=Higgins|publisher=Chemical News|title=European Chemicals Industry:A review|url=http://www.nepic.co.uk/WebformFolder/IndiaChemicalNews_Issue3.pdf|date=April 2013|pages=18–20|access-date=2013-08-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723230317/http://www.nepic.co.uk/WebformFolder/IndiaChemicalNews_Issue3.pdf#|archive-date=2015-07-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the 20 years between 1991 and 2011 the European Chemical industry saw its sales increase 295 billion Euros to 539 billion Euros a picture of constant growth. Despite this the European industry’s share of the world chemical market has fallen from 36% to 20%. This has resulted from the huge increase production and sales in the emerging markets like India and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=CEFIC|title=Facts and Figures 2012:The European chemicals industry in a worldwide perspective|url=http://www.cefic.org/Documents/FactsAndFigures/2012/Facts-and-Figures-2012-The-Brochure.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data suggest that 95% of this impact is from China alone. In 2012 the data from the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC)shows that 5 European countries account for 71% of the EU's chemicals sales. These are Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=CEFIC|title=Facts and Figures 2012:The European chemicals industry in a worldwide perspective|url=http://www.cefic.org/Documents/FactsAndFigures/2012/Facts-and-Figures-2012-The-Brochure.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical industry has shown rapid growth for more than fifty years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The fastest-growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic [[organic polymer]]s used as [[plastics]], [[fibres]] and [[elastomers]]. Historically and presently the chemical industry has been concentrated in three areas of the world, Western Europe, North America and Japan (the Triad). The European Community remains the largest producer area followed by the US and Japan.

The traditional dominance of chemical production by the Triad countries is being challenged by changes in feedstock availability and price, labour cost, energy cost, differential rates of economic growth and environmental pressures. Instrumental in the changing structure of the global chemical industry has been the growth in China, India, Korea, the Middle East, South East Asia, Nigeria, and Brazil.

Just as companies emerge as the main producers of the chemical industry, we can also look on a more global scale to how industrialized countries rank, with regards to the billions of dollars worth of production a country or region could export.  Though the business of chemistry is worldwide in scope, the bulk of the world’s $3.7 trillion chemical output is accounted for by only a handful of industrialized nations. The United States alone produced $689 billion, 18.6 percent of the total world chemical output in 2008.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_acc/sec_directory.asp?CID=292&amp;DID=747|title=Global Business of Chemistry|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019103305/http://americanchemistry.com/s_acc/sec_directory.asp?CID=292&amp;DID=747#|archive-date=2010-10-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3254">A '''conical mill''' (or conical screen mill) is a machine used to reduce the size of material in a uniform manner. It is an alternative to the [[hammermill]] or other forms of [[Mill (grinding)|grinding mills]]. As the name implies, the conical mill varies in diameter from where the feed enters to where the product exits.  

The conical mill operates by having the product being fed into the mill by gravity or vacuum. A rotating impeller forces the material outward to a conical screen surface, where it is sized and passed through the openings in the screen. Once finished, the product simply drops through the milling chamber to a receptacle underneath.

Conical mills come in a variety of sizes from tabletop lab models to full-size high-capacity machines for use in processing large quantities of material, and the impeller and screen can be customized for each individual use. The machines can be used not only to reduce the size of particles, but also for deagglomeration, sieving, dispersion, and mixing.

The applications for a conical mill are varied, but trend towards use in the food, cosmetic, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries:
*Reclaiming broken pharmaceutical tablets by grinding them back into powder for re-forming.
*Sizing wet granulated particles before drying, and sizing dry granulated particles after they've dried before tabletting.
*Delumping dry [[detergent]] during production
*Dispersing [[pearl]] into [[rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] and [[face powder]]
*Deagglomerating dried fruits such as [[raisin]]s or [[cranberry|cranberries]].
*Creating [[breadcrumbs]] from scraps

The conical mill has some marked advantages over the hammermill, especially in the pharmaceutical industry: low noise, heat and dust, a more uniform particle size, flexibility in design, and higher capacity.

The concept of the conical mill was created in 1976 by the engineers of Quadro Engineering, who remains the foremost manufacturer of conical mills. Conical mills are available in Ex- execution with a variety of sieves and impellers. The mill head can be mounted on a mobile lifter which allows for easy up and down movement for docking into containers, tablet presses and others. The mill head is dismounted from a lifter for easy cleaning.

'''Creative [[Problem solving|problem-solving]]''' is the mental process of searching for an original and previously unknown solution to a problem. To qualify, the solution must be novel and reached independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punya.educ.msu.edu/presentations/creativityworkshop/group-dynamics-assignment|title=Creative problem solving for teachers|author=Michigan State University}}{{dead link|fix-attempted=yes|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creative solution types ==
The process of creative problem-solving usually begins with defining the problem. This may lead to finding a simple non-creative solution, a textbook solution, or discovering prior solutions developed by other individuals. If the discovered solution is sufficient, the process may then be abandoned&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativeeducationfoundation.org/creative-problem-solving/ Definition of creative problem solving] on Alex Osborn's (inventor of the term and process of [[brainstorming]]) Creative Education Foundation website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u.arizona.edu/~dusana/psych325presession/notes/CH11.ppt&amp;ei=CG7kUMmLLof44QSF3oCwBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHIBTx2KJRqQEGiABvCJuPAPSkkuQ&amp;sig2=OIt8RA3BVdpyqHigVwilwQ&amp;bvm=bv.1355534169,d.bGE Problem definition]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in presentation on creative problem-solving, on the [[University of Arizona]] website&lt;/ref&gt;.

A creative solution will often have distinct characteristics that include using only existing components, or the problematic factor, as the basis for the solution. However, a change of perspective may in many cases be helpful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativethinkingassoc.com/mikevance.html Mike Vence about the 9 dots as a corporate promotion of creative thinking] at the [[Walt Disney Company]] (Creative Thinking Association website)&lt;/ref&gt; A solution may also be considered creative if readily available components can be used to solve the problem within a short time limit&lt;ref&gt;[http://wmsci2012.wordpress.com/2012/07/13/enhanced-creativity-and-problem-solving-an-interdisciplinary-approach/ About creative problem solving] in an invitation to a conference by the [[University of South Alabama]]&lt;/ref&gt; (factors typical to the solutions employed by the title character in the television series [[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]).

If a creative solution has broad application – that is, uses that go beyond the original intent –, it may be referred to as an innovative solution, or an [[innovation]] (some innovations may also be considered an [[invention]]).
{{quote|text="All innovations [begin] as creative solutions, but not all creative solutions become innovations."&lt;ref name=fobes1993&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Fobes|title=The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox: A Complete Course in the Art of Creating Solutions to Problems of Any Kind|year=1993|ISBN=0-9632221-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; |author=Richard Fobes}}

== Techniques and tools ==
Many techniques and tools employed for creating effective solutions to a problem are described in [[creativity techniques]] and [[problem-solving]] articles.

=== Creative problem-solving technique categories ===
* '''Mental state shift and cognitive re-framing''': Changing one’s focus away from active problem-solving and towards a creative solution set.
* '''Multiple idea facilitation''': Increasing the quantity of fresh ideas based on the belief that a greater number of ideas will raise the chances that one of these is valuable. This may include randomly selecting an idea (such as choosing a word from a list) and thinking about its similarities to the situation. In turn, this random act may inspire a related idea that would lead to a solution.
* '''Inducing a change of perspective''': Efficiently entering a fresh perspective may result in a solution that thereby becomes obvious. This is especially useful for solving particularly challenging problems.&lt;ref name=fobes1993 /&gt; Many techniques to this end involve identifying independent dimensions that differentiate closely associated concepts.&lt;ref name=fobes1993 /&gt; Differentiating concepts helps overcome a tendency to use oversimplified associative thinking, in which two related concepts are so closely associated that their differences are overlooked.&lt;ref name=fobes1993 /&gt;

'''Cyber City, Kochi''', also known as HDIL Cyber City, is a proposed [[Special Economic Zone]] [[information technology]] park in the city of [[Kochi]], [[Kerala]], [[India]]. It is promoted by HDIL and is located near [[HMT (company)|HMT]] at [[Kalamassery]].&lt;ref name="will-not-exit-cybercity-project"&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The Hindu|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/hdil-says-it-will-not-exit-cybercity-project-in-kochi/article4788645.ece|title=HDIL says it will not exit Cybercity project in Kochi |accessdate=2016-05-06|location=Chennai, India|date=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SEZ will be built over a land area of {{convert|70|acre|ha|1}}. Construction was expected to start on 17 February 2011, and the first phase was scheduled to be within two years.&lt;ref name="Work Starts"&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The Hindu|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/work-on-cyber-city-to-begin-today/article1463836.ece|title=Work on Cyber City to begin today |accessdate=2011-02-17|location=Chennai, India|date=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current status of the project is uncertain as the work never commenced as planned.

According to the rules governing a Special Economic Zone, 70% of the built-up area will be processing area for IT and ITES business, primarily for export. The remaining 30 per cent is categorised as a non-processing zone and will feature shopping malls, convention centres, apartment complexes and other lifestyle needs, developing it into a full-fledged township.&lt;ref name="Launch News"&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=The New Indian Express|url=http://newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/article397776.ece|title=HDIL Cyber City to be launched today|date=2011-02-17|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first phase consists of a built-up space of {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2|-2|abbr=on}}, to be built in two years. Once completed, it will house a built-up space of {{convert|10000000|sqft|m2|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Work Starts"/&gt;

==Location &amp; Connectivity==

The planned township is on 70 acres of land bought from HMT. It is located 17&amp;nbsp;km from the city centre and 22&amp;nbsp;km from the [[CIAL|International Airport]], among an area where a number of other similar developments are being planned. the distance to [[National Highway 47 (India)|NH 47]] is 5&amp;nbsp;km.

The [[VSNL]]’s communication [[Gateway (computer networking)|gateway]] is located less than 7&amp;nbsp;km from the park. This gateway handles around 70% of the country’s data traffic.&lt;ref name="cost effective bandwidth"&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The Hindu|url=http://subscribe.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/eweek.dll/portal/ep/itcontentView.do?contentId=6239024&amp;programId=6037308&amp;BV_ID=@@@|title=Kerala has cost effective bandwidth|accessdate=2016-05-06|location=Kochi, India|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity to the [[SAFE (cable system)|SAFE]] and [[SEA-ME-WE 3]] cables dropping zone and direct optical fibre link to the gigabyte router of VSNL, enables the park to offer 100% uptime data connectivity to units. Kochi offers [[Pacific]] and [[Atlantic]] route of connectivity to the [[US]].

==Infrastructure==

70% of the built up area of the township will be used for IT and ITES industries. The remaining 30% will be non processing area, used for residential, commercial and entertainment purposes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2040">In the design of [[user interface|human-machine user interfaces]] (HMIs or UIs), the '''Design Eye Position (DEP)''' is the position from which the user is intended to view the [[workstation]] for an optimal view of the visual interface. The Design Eye Position represents the ideal but notional location of the operator's view and is usually expressed as a monocular point midway between the pupils of the average user. The DEP may also allow for a standardisation of monocular and binocular "Field of View" and may be integrated into the [[CAD/CAM]] design system used to define the workstation build.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cockpiteval.home.att.net/MilStd1333.htm US Military Standard 1333A, Aircrew Station Geometry For Military Aircraft]&lt;/ref&gt;

The DEP is particularly important in those operator workstations, such as the [[cockpit]] of a military fast jet, where an accurate reading of information and symbols on displays may be critical. When designing such user interfaces the DEP is used as the reference point for the location of items (e.g. displays or controls) within the interface.

== Military Aviation ==
With [[collimated]] displays, such of the cockpit [[Head Up Display]], the projected symbology is aligned very precisely with the outside world to allow for precise delivery of weapons and also for safe landing. Unless located at the Design Eye Position the pilot cannot see the symbology as it is effectively focussed at infinity. Similarly, Head Down Displays will usually be angled precisely towards the DEP so that all symbols may be equally visible to the pilot without parallax or other display distortion errors.

Pilots who are below or above the 50% percentile point for sitting height, i.e. not of average stature, may need to adjust the seat in order to attain the DEP, even if this means compromising their optimal reach envelope. This is why, for example, rudder pedals may need to be adjustable.

A '''digital pattern generator''' is a piece of electronic test equipment or software used to generate digital electronics stimuli. Digital electronics stimuli are a specific kind of electrical waveform varying between two conventional voltages that correspond to two logic states ("low state" and "high state", "0" and "1"). The main purpose of a digital pattern generator is to stimulate the inputs of a digital electronic device. For that reason, the voltage levels generated by a digital pattern generator are often compatible with digital electronics I/O standards – [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]], LVTTL, [[LVCMOS]] and [[LVDS]], for instance.
 
Digital pattern generators are sometimes referred to as "pulse generator" or "pulse pattern generator" which may be able to function as digital pattern generators as well. Hence, the distinction between the two types of equipment may not be clear. A digital pattern generator is a source of synchronous digital stimulus; the generated signal is interesting for testing digital electronics at logic level - this is why they are also called "logic source". A pulse generator is of purpose to generate electrical pulse of different shapes; they are mostly used for tests at an electrical or analog level.
Another common name for such equipment is "digital logic source" or "logic source".

Digital pattern generator can produce either repetitive, or single-shot signals in which case some kind of triggering source is required (internal or external).

== Types of digital pattern generators ==
Digital pattern generators are today available as '''stand-alone units''', '''add-on hardware modules''' for other equipment such as a [logic analyzer] or as '''PC-based equipment'''.

'''Stand-alone units''' are self-contained devices that include everything from the user interface to define the patterns that should be generated to the electronic equipment that actually generates the output signal.

Some test equipment manufacturers propose pattern generators as '''add-on modules''' for logic analyzers (see for example the PG3A module for Tektronix' TLA7000 series of logic analyzers). In this case, the pattern generator is the "generation counterpart" to the analysis functionality offered by logic analyzers.

'''PC-based digital pattern generators''' are connected to a PC through peripheral ports such as PCI, USB and/or Ethernet (see for example the "Wave Generator Xpress" from Byte Paradigm, connected through USB). They use the PC as user interface for defining and storing the digital patterns to be sent.

== Features ==
Digital pattern generators are primarily characterized by a number of digital channels, a maximum rate and the supported voltage standards.
* The number of digital channels defines the maximum width of any pattern generated - typically, 8-bits, 16-bits, 32 bits pattern generator. A 16-bits pattern generator is able to generate arbitrary digital samples on from 1 to 16 bits.
* The maximum rate defines the minimum time interval between 2 successive patterns. For instance, a 50&amp;nbsp;MHz (50 MSample/s) digital pattern generator is able to output a new pattern every 20 nanoseconds.
* The supported voltage standards ultimately define the set of electronic devices a digital pattern generator can be used with. Concretely, the voltages and the transition characteristics of the signal at the output of the digital pattern generator will be compliant to these voltage standards. Examples of supported voltage standards: [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]], LVTTL, [[LVCMOS]], [[LVDS]].

Most digital pattern generator add features such as the ability to generate a repetitive sequence or a digital clock signal at a specified frequency, the ability to use an external clock input and triggering options, to start pattern generation upon the reception of an event from an external input.

== Common applications ==
* Digital electronics and [[embedded system]] testing and debugging
* Stimulation of [[digital signal processing]] hardware
* [[Digital-to-analog converter]] stimulation

== Special purpose digital pattern generators ==
Video digital pattern generators are digital pattern generators dedicated to the generation of a specific test pattern in a specific digital video format such as [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] or [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]].

== Criticism ==
The dipper well has been criticized in the [[United States]] as wasteful since on average it pumps  {{convert|30|to|60|USgal|L}} of water an hour and is normally left running continuously.&lt;ref name="Brean" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Energy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-15/local/me-6948_1_ice-cream/2|title=People and Events|last=Jones|first=Jack|date=15 July 1988|work=Los Angeles Times|page=2|accessdate=7 June 2010|location=Los Angeles, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because its potential for water waste is counteracted by a potential for increased sanitation, most [[public health|health]] regulations do not prohibit or mandate dipper wells.  It was estimated in 1988 that a dipper well running 12 hours a day in a single [[business]] could use up to {{convert|260,000|USgal|m3}} of water yearly.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;  It was found that some establishments, however, left dipper wells running even while the business was closed.&lt;ref name="Brean" /&gt;

The '''Distributed Management Task Force''' ('''DMTF''') is a computer software trade group which works to simplify the manageability of network-accessible technologies.

==Overview==
The DMTF creates open manageability standards spanning diverse emerging and traditional IT infrastructures including cloud, virtualization, network, servers and storage. Member companies and alliance partners worldwide collaborate on standards to improve the interoperable management of information technologies.

The DMTF board of directors is led by technology companies including: [[Broadcom Inc.]], [[CA Technologies]], [[Dell Inc.]], [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.]], [[HP Inc.]], [[Intel Corporation]], [[Lenovo]], [[NetApp]], [[Software AG]], [[Vertiv]] and [[VMware]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dmtf.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{Anchor|PMCI}}Standards==
DMTF standards include:
*''[[Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface]]'' (''CIMI''){{snd}} a self-service interface for infrastructure clouds, allowing users to dynamically provision, configure and administer their cloud usage with a high-level interface that greatly simplifies [[cloud computing system|cloud system]]s [[systems management|management]]. The specification standardizes interactions between cloud environments to achieve interoperable cloud infrastructure management between service providers and their consumers and developers, enabling users to manage their cloud infrastructure use easily and without complexity.
*''[[Common Information Model (computing)|Common Information Model]]'' (''CIM''){{snd}} the CIM schema is a [[conceptual schema]] that defines how the managed elements in an IT environment (for instance [[computer]]s or [[storage area network]]s) are represented as a common set of [[Object (computer science)|objects]] and relationships between them. CIM is extensible in order to allow product specific extensions to the common definition of these managed elements. CIM uses a model based upon [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] to define the CIM Schema. CIM is the basis for most of the other DMTF standards.
*''[https://www.dmtf.org/standards/cdm Common Diagnostic Model]'' (''CDM''){{snd}} the CDM schema is a part of the CIM schema that defines how system diagnostics should be incorporated into the management infrastructure.
*''[[Web-Based Enterprise Management]]'' (''WBEM''){{snd}} defines protocols for the interaction between systems management infrastructure components implementing CIM, a concept of DMTF management profiles, that allows defining the behavior of the elements defined in the CIM schema, the CIM Query Language (CQL) and other specifications needed for the interoperability of CIM infrastructure.
*''[[Systems Management Architecture for Server Hardware]]'' (''SMASH''){{snd}} a DMTF Management Initiative that include management profiles for server hardware management. SMASH 2.0 allows for either WS-Management or SM-CLP (a [[Command line interface|command line]] protocol for interacting with CIM infrastructure). SM-CLP was adopted as an International Standard in August 2011 by the Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC).&lt;ref name="businesswire1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110830005508/en/DMTF-Gains-International-Recognition-ISOIEC-Standards |title=DMTF Gains International Recognition with Two ISO/IEC Standards |publisher=Business Wire |date=2011-08-30 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[SMBIOS|System Management BIOS]]'' (''SMBIOS''){{snd}} defines how the [[BIOS]] interface of [[x86|x86 architecture]] systems is represented in CIM (and DMI).
*''[[Alert Standard Format]]'' (''ASF''){{snd}} defines remote control and alerting interfaces for OS-absent environments (for instance a system board controller of a [[Personal computer|PC]]).
*''[[Desktop Management Interface]]'' (''DMI''){{snd}} the first desktop management standard.  Due to the rapid advancement of DMTF technologies, such as CIM, the DMTF defined an "end of life" process for DMI, which ended March 31, 2005.
*''[[Redfish (specification)|Redfish]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}} DMTF's Redfish API is an open industry standard specification and schema designed to meet the expectations of end users for simple, modern and secure management of scalable platform hardware. Created by the Redfish Forum (formerly the Scalable Platforms Management Forum, SPMF), Redfish specifies a RESTful interface and utilizes JSON and OData to help customers integrate solutions within their existing tool chains.
*''[http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wsman Web Services Management]'' (''WS-MAN''){{snd}} The DMTF’s Web Services Management (WS-Man) provides interoperability between management applications and managed resources, and identifies a core set of web service specifications and usage requirements that expose a common set of operations central to all systems management.A SOAP-based protocol for managing computer systems (e.g., personal computers, workstations, servers, smart devices), WS-Man supports web services and helps constellations of computer systems and network-based services collaborate seamlessly.
*''[[Desktop and mobile Architecture for System Hardware]]'' (''DASH''){{snd}} a management standard based on DMTF Web Services for Management (WS-Management), for desktop and mobile client systems. WS-Management was adopted as an international standard by ISO/IEC in 2013.&lt;ref name="businesswire2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130226005073/en/DMTF-Standards-Gain-Global-Recognition |title=DMTF Standards Gain Global Recognition |publisher=Business Wire |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cmdbf/ Configuration Management Database Federation]'' (''CMDBf''){{snd}} facilitates the sharing of information between configuration management databases (CMDBs) and other management data repositories (MDRs). The CMDBf standard enables organizations to federate and access information from complex, multi-vendor infrastructures, simplifying the process of managing related configuration data stored in multiple CMDBs and MDRs.
*''[http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cadf The Cloud Auditing Data Federation]'' (''CADF''){{snd}} The Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard defines a full event model anyone can use to fill in the essential data needed to certify, self-manage and self-audit application security in cloud environments. CADF is an open standard that addresses this need by enabling cross-vendor information sharing via its data format and interface definitions.
*''[http://www.dmtf.org/standards/pmci Platform Management Components Intercommunication]'' (''PMCI''){{snd}} a suite of specifications defining a common architecture for intercommunication among management subsystem components. This suite includes [[MCTP]], PLDM and [[NC-SI]] specifications. The Platform Management standard was adopted as a national standard by ANSI in 2013.&lt;ref name="businesswire2"/&gt;
*''[http://www.dmtf.org/initiatives/vman_initiative/ Virtualization Management Initiative]'' (''VMAN''){{snd}} a suite of specifications based on DMTF’s CIM that helps IT managers: Deploy virtual computer systems, Discover/inventory virtual computer systems, Manage lifecycle of virtual computer systems, Create/modify/delete virtual resources and Monitor virtual systems for health and performance. VMAN was adopted as a National Standard by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) [[International Committee for Information Technology Standards]] (INCITS) in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmtf.org/content/dmtfs-vman-standard-achieves-ansi-adoption |title=DMTF's VMAN Standard Achieves ANSI Adoption |publisher=DMTF |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[http://www.dmtf.org/standards/netman The Network Management Initiative] (NETMAN){{snd}} addresses today’s complex data center and network environments. The initiative will lead the industry toward the unification of network management across traditional, cloud and software defined data center (SDDC) environments with the development of integrated standards to address physical, virtual, application-centric and software defined networks. While cloud, virtualization and software defined networking have eased the use of network functions for consumers, the challenges of deploying and managing the network supporting these infrastructures have magnified. Addressing the current complexity and abstraction, DMTF’s NETMAN will provide the necessary standards-based management models and interfaces to enable consistent, unified and automated provisioning, deployment, configuration, and monitoring of network environments.

Within the VMAN initiative, there are several specifications and profiles:

*''[[Open Virtualization Format]]'' (''OVF''){{snd}} a standard for packaging and deploying [[virtual appliance]]s. OVF was adopted by the [[American National Standards Institute]] in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vmblog.com/archive/2010/08/31/dmtf-s-open-virtualization-format-achieves-ansi-adoption.aspx |title=DMTF's Open Virtualization Format Achieves ANSI Adoption |publisher=Vmblog.com |date=2010-09-26 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; OVF was adopted as an International Standard in August 2011 by the Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC).&lt;ref name="businesswire1"/&gt; In January 2013, DMTF released the second version of the standard, OVF 2.0 which applies to emerging cloud use cases and provides important developments from OVF 1.0 including improved network configuration support and package encryption capabilities for safe delivery.

CIM related standards are also developed outside of the DMTF. Some examples are:
*The ''[[Storage Networking Industry Association]]  (SNIA){{snd}} develops and maintains the ''[[SMI-S]]'' standard that defines DMTF management profiles for [[Storage area network|Storage Area Networks]].
*''[[The Open Group]]''{{snd}} develops and maintains the ''[[Common Manageability Programming Interface|CMPI]]'' standard that defines a [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] [[Application programming interface|API]] for CIM providers.
*The ''[[Java Community Process]]''{{snd}} develops the ''[[JSR-48]]'' standard that defines a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] API for CIM client applications.

CIM and WBEM are supported by a large number of products and [[open-source software|open source]] projects.

==Incubators and work groups==
*Open Cloud Standards Incubator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmtf.org/about/cloud-incubator/ Open Cloud Standards Incubator] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430102409/http://www.dmtf.org/about/cloud-incubator/ |date=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Open Cloud Standards Incubator was a DMTF group focused on standards for facilitating management interoperability between private clouds within enterprises and between private, public and hybrid clouds. Initial priorities include cloud resource management protocols, packaging formats and security mechanisms to help enable interoperability. The group developed a set of documents&lt;!--[http://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP-IS0102_1.0.0.pdf architecture for managing clouds], [http://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP-IS0103_1.0.0.pdf use cases and interactions for managing clouds] and a white paper titled [http://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP-IS0101_1.0.0.pdf "The Interoperable Cloud"]--&gt;. The group completed its chartered deliverables in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud Management Journal: http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/1476376&lt;/ref&gt; DMTF's cloud standards development work is now being handled by the Cloud Management Workgroup,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/DMTF%20Cloud%20Management%20WG%20Charter%20V1_1g_03-10-11.pdf Cloud Management Workgroup]&lt;/ref&gt; the Cloud Auditing Data Federation Workgroup&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/DMTF_Cloud_Auditing_Data_Federation_Charter%20v1.0.8.pdf Cloud Auditing Data Federation Workgroup]&lt;/ref&gt; and the System Virtualization, Partitioning, and Clustering Work Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/SVPCWGCharter_0.pdf System Virtualization, Partitioning, and Clustering Work Group]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Software Entitlement Working Group (SEWG).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/SEWG_Charter_2012-10-26.pdf Software Entitlement Working Group]&lt;/ref&gt; The Software Entitlement Working Group is working to develop white papers which focus on challenges to enabling the industry to manage licensed software products and product use. The SEWG employs key leaders in the IT management space, and also has representation from end user organizations such as JP Morgan Chase. The group developed a whitepaper titled "Software Identification and Entitlement Usage Metrics",&lt;ref&gt;[http://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP-IS0301_1.0.0.pdf "Software Identification and Entitlement Usage Metrics"]&lt;/ref&gt; completed in 2012. This white paper describes a representative set of use cases for cloud, data center, virtualization, and on-premises needs. It also provides recommendations on technology standards to consider to sufficiently identify licensed software products, and to trace and gather the use of the software and other entitlement usage metrics across the span of deployments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3823">'''EN 1063''', or CEN 1063, is a security glazing standard created by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] for measuring the protective strength of bullet-resistant glass. It is commonly used in conjunction with EN 1522 (Euronorm standard for Bullet Resistance in Windows, Doors, Shutters and Blinds) to form a [[Terminal ballistics|ballistic]] classification system by which armored vehicles and structures are tested and rated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bullet Resistance|url=http://www.sitec.de/en/information-and-advice/bullet-resistance|publisher=SITEC|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar classification system primarily used in the [[United States]] is [[NIJ 0108|NIJ Standard 0108]], the U.S. [[National Institute of Justice]]'s Standard for Ballistic Resistant Protective Materials which includes glass and armor plate.

== Threat Levels ==

The protective strength of a glazed shielding is rated based on the type of munitions, or threat level, it is capable of withstanding. There are 7 main standard threat levels: BR1-BR7 (also written as B1-B7), each corresponding to a different type of [[small arms]] fire. Additionally, there are two other threat levels (SG1 &amp; SG2) corresponding to shotgun munitions.

To be given a particular rating, the glazing must stop the bullet for the specified number of strikes, with multiple strikes placed within 120mm of each other. The glazing should also be shatterproof and produce no [[spalling|spalls]] after each strike. Lastly, the classification levels are numbered in order of increasing protective strength. Thus any sample complying with the requirements of one class also complies with the requirements of previous classes. However, the SG (shotgun) classes do not necessarily comply with BR classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jeremy|last=Watney|url=http://www.ballisticedge.com.au/BSEN1063.htm|title=BS EN1063 2000|publisher=Ballistic Edge Research Laboratory Mechanical Impact Testing|year=2000|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5606">'''Employee experience design''' ('''EED or EXD''') is the application of [[experience design]] in order to intentionally designing [[Human resources|HR]] products, services, events, and organizational environments with a focus on the quality of the employee [[experience]] and organizationally relevant solutions.

==Overview==

EED can be described as the "intentional design of the active or passive use of HR products or services",&lt;ref name="Menzel-Black &amp; Völkl"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Menzel-Black, C.|author2=Völkl, C.|title=Nach Bedarf designt|journal=Personalmagazin|year=2014|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christin_Menzel/publication/264310054_Nach_Bedarf_designt/links/53d7f23a0cf2631430bfdcad?ev=pub_ext_doc_dl&amp;origin=publication_detail&amp;inViewer=true|doi=10.13140/2.1.3054.4001|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and employee experiences in general, that affect employees' emotional reaction and therefore their particular behaviors and loyalty.&lt;ref name="Pullmann &amp; Gross"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pullman, M. E.|author2=Gross, M. A.|year=2014|title=Ability of Experience Design Elements to Elicit Emotions and Loyalty Behaviors|journal=Decision Sciences|volume=35|issue=3|pages=551–578|doi=10.1111/j.0011-7315.2004.02611.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0011-7315.2004.02611.x/full|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying assumption is that best (customer/employee) relationships are emotional in nature and achieved when companies succeed in not only satisfying certain needs (e.g. compensation), but also making interactions pleasurable.&lt;ref name="Pullmann &amp; Gross"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pine &amp; Gilmore"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pine, J.|author2=Gilmore, J.|title=The Experience Economy|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston|year=1998|url=http://hbr.org/1998/07/welcome-to-the-experience-economy/|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal is to yield better [[customer experience]] through increased [[employee engagement]] and employee [[empowerment]].&lt;ref name="Ramaswamy"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ramaswamy, V.|year=2009|title=Leading the transformation to co‐creation of value|journal=Strategy &amp; Leadership|volume=37|issue=2|pages=32–37|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/10878570910941208|doi=10.1108/10878570910941208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Krippendorf, EED focuses on creating meaningful and sense-making opportunities for engagement,&lt;ref name="Krippendorf"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krippendorff, K.|year=1989|title=On the essential contexts of artifacts or on the proposition that" design is making sense (of things)|journal=Design Issues|volume=5|number=2|pages=9–39|jstor=1511512|doi=10.2307/1511512}}&lt;/ref&gt; and addressing aspirational &lt;ref name="Ramaswamy" /&gt; and fundamental psychological needs of an employee, such as autonomy, competence and relatedness.&lt;ref name="Sheldon"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sheldon, K. M.|author2=Elliot, A. J.|author3=Kim, Y.|author4=Kasser, T.|year=2001|title=What is satisfying about satisfying events?

==Methods==

Related to [[design strategy]], EED is a participatory systems approach to workplace improvements that applies methods and principles of [[experience design]], such as [[design thinking]], [[co-creation]] and [[empathic design]].&lt;ref name="Menzel-Black &amp; Völkl" /&gt; It also uses tools and techniques that are typical to [[customer experience management]] and [[service design]], e.g. employee experience journey mapping&lt;ref name="Oracle"&gt;{{cite web|author=Oracle Human Capital Management|year=2014|title=An Employee Centric Approach To HR – Employee Experience Journey Mapping (EXJM)|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/employee-centric-hr-2203095.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[touchpoint]] analysis.

Primary design object is the employee experience, which – when successful – an employee finds unique, memorable and sustainable over time, would want to repeat and build upon, and enthusiastically promotes via word of mouth.&lt;ref name="Pine &amp; Gilmore" /&gt; It is suspected to encourage loyalty by creating an emotional connection through engaging, compelling, and consistent context.&lt;ref name="Pullmann &amp; Gross" /&gt; The categories for employee experience design context are products, processes, artefacts, content, space and interactions.&lt;ref name="Menzel-Black &amp; Völkl" /&gt;

==Stakeholders==
[[Human resource management]], operating across hierarchies and departments, plays a central role in design, distribution and delivery of EED. As co-creation is an important design principle, it is a shared task and joint responsibility of leadership, HR professionals and employees.&lt;ref name="Menzel-Black &amp; Völkl" /&gt; Following the logic of the [[service-profit chain]], beneficiaries are also customers, as the recipients of improved service quality and the organization itself through increased profits.&lt;ref name="Heskett"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Heskett, J. L.|author2=Schlesinger, L. A. |year=1994|title=Putting the service-profit chain to work|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=72|issue=2|pages=164–174|url=http://www.tgli.cl/students/intranet/content/Lecturas/Putting%20the%20Service-Profit%20Cahin%20to%20work.pdf|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EFMS.pdf|thumb|EFMS]]
'''Energy and facility management software''' is a term used to refer to an enterprise-wide platform for handling technical data related to buildings and stems from the merger of [[Energy management software|EMS]] (energy management software), [[Computer-aided facility management|CAFM]] (Computer Aided Facility Management) and [[Energy accounting software|EAS]] (Energy Accounting Software). As such it involves the gathering and processing or information that is required for maintaining acceptable indoor comfort level while minimizing energy use.

==Purpose==
An EFMS serves a dual purpose:

*'''Tactical:''' On a day-to-day operational level an EFMS will help improve comfort level where required while minimizing energy consumption. Should comfort level not be an issue, the EFMS will focus processes and resources on reducing energy spending.
*'''Strategic:''' On a mid-to-long term scope an EFMS will support the development strategy of the organization with information that will support managerial decisions such as systems, vendors or processes efficiencies, ratings and critical areas etc.

== Method ==

=== Information Classes ===
To achieve its purpose an EFMS integrates several informational classes in a common processing environment, mainly:

*'''Energy consumption information''' information commonly handled by an EMS and derived from online metering devices (such as [[Electric energy meter|Energy meters]], [[Gas meter]]s).
*'''System information''' such as [[HVAC|HVAC systems]] settings, sensor readings etc. commonly resident in a [[Building Management System|BMS]].
*'''Assets Information''', such as building size, floor number and area, cooling capacity of installed [[HVAC|HVAC systems]], maintenance logs etc. commonly found in a CAFM system.
*'''Weather information''' commonly derived from internet weather feeds or locally installed sensors.
*'''Occupancy / Use information''' such as room occupancy of a hotel or customers served at a retail store commonly found in an [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]].
*'''Utility bills information''' commonly resident in an [[Energy accounting software|EAS]] (Energy Accounting Software).

=== Components ===
An EFMS should be consisted of at least the following modules:

*'''Visualization / Dashboard Module''' which will present graphical or table illustrations of energy information (from EMS), system information (from BMS) and Billing information (from EAS).
*'''Alarming Module''' which will create and manage alarms based on given threshold values and / or Faults Detection &amp; Diagnosis detection methods.
*'''Work Order Module''' which will create and manage notifications of alarms directed towards appropriate users. The Work Order Module will manage actions of users related to each fault along the Fault Cycle (birth, detection, diagnosis, action, evaluation).
*'''Data Sources Module''' which will manage the connection to and synchronization with the various data sources such as energy management systems and metering devices, [[Building Management System|BMS]], [[Energy accounting software|EAS]], [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] etc.
*'''Reporting Module''' which will manage the creation and distribution of energy and facility reports.

=== Processes ===
The processes performed in an EFMS fall under the categories of:
*'''Entry Processes''' which may be ''tactical'' such as the automated synchronization with a BMS or ERP or ''ad hoc'' such as the manual entry of utility bills data or the upload of a maintenance log.
*'''FDD Processes''' (''Faults Detection &amp; Diagnosis'') which may include sub-processes for setting various thresholds, selecting from a list of rules which ones should be applied to each specific building / installation and the tactical application of rule sets and threshold values to an FDD scanning process of building related data.
*'''Work Order Processes''' which include processes for relaying alerts and faults to users and managing the actions they undertake until the issue is resolved.
*'''Reporting Processes''' which involve tactical creation of visualization elements and reports or ad hoc querying processes for data mining and faults investigation.

==Applications==
Applications of integrated EFMS suites will benefit mostly organizations with either very large and busy facilities, such as malls, hotel complexes and transportation hubs the complexity of which challenges operational efficiency and organizations with many buildings dispersed across remote locations such as retail chains, restaurant chains, banks and food store chains which operate medium-sized buildings that stretch [[facility management]] operations to high costs.

Commercial property managers that plan and manage energy efficiency projects generally use a software platform to perform energy audits and to collaborate with contractors to understand their full range of options. The [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=622/pagename=alpha_list_sub Department of Energy (DOE) Software Directory] describes EnergyActio software, a cloud based platform designed for this purpose.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9196">[[Image:EDO_Logo.png|thumb|alt=Official logo of the Engineering Duty Officer Community.|Official logotype of the engineering duty officer community]]

An '''engineering duty officer''' (EDO) is a [[restricted line officer]] in the [[United States Navy]], involved with the [[Ship design|design]], [[Military acquisition|acquisition]], [[Shipbuilding|construction]], [[repair]], [[Maintenance (technical)|maintenance]], [[Energy conversion|conversion]], [[Refueling and Overhaul|overhaul]] and [[Ship disposal|disposal]] of [[United States Navy ships|ships]], [[List of submarines of the United States Navy|submarines]], [[List of aircraft carriers of the United States Navy|aircraft carriers]], and the systems installed aboard ([[weapon]]s, [[command and control]], [[communication]]s, [[computer]]s). As of August 1, 2016, there are approximately 835 engineering duty officers on [[active duty]] in the U.S. Navy, representing approximately 2 percent of its active-duty [[commissioned officer]]s (and approximately 400 engineering duty officers in the Navy Reserve).

==Mission==
The engineering duty officer community provides experienced naval engineers to provide technical advice and leadership [http://www.navy.mil/navydata/people/secnav/england/navpow21.pdf].  EDO's are involved with the design, acquisition, construction, repair, maintenance, conversion, overhaul, and disposal of ships, submarines, and the systems installed aboard.  EDOs are unique to the Navy because they start their careers as [[Unrestricted Line Officer|URL officers]].  First, prospective EDOs learn how to operate ships or submarines. Next, all EDOs obtain technical/engineering [[Master's degree]]s.  Then, as engineering duty officers, they assume technical leadership roles.

==Insignia==
As [[line officer]]s of the Navy, EDOs wear an inverted gold star above their [[United States Navy officer rank insignia|rank stripes]] on both their dress blue [[Uniforms of the United States Navy|uniforms]] and on their [[shoulder board]]s.  In virtually all respects, their uniforms are indistinguishable from their Unrestricted Line (URL) counterparts.  The two predominant sources of new EDOs are by Lateral Transfer from another URL [[List of Naval Officer Designators|designator]] or by choosing to exercise their Engineering Duty Option granted upon commissioning.[http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/Detailing/rlstaffcorps/engineering/Pages/EDAccessions.aspx]  For active duty URL Officers, a requirement for Lateral Transfer, or for exercising an Engineering Duty Option, is the completion of either [[Submarine Warfare insignia|Submarine Warfare]] or [[Surface Warfare Officer|Surface Warfare]] qualification.  Therefore, the vast majority of EDOs wear the same Submarine Warfare or Surface Warfare insignia as their URL counterparts.

A small number of EDOs ''not'' previously qualified as submarine warfare officers can volunteer for the Engineering Duty Dolphin Program, and by successfully completing it, earn their [[Submarine Engineering Duty insignia]].

[[File:Engineering Duty Officer.jpg|thumb|275px|Engineering Duty Officer Qualification Insignia]]
The EDO qualification insignia was approved in June 2017. Taking the same form as other [[Badges of the United States Navy|warfare or qualification devices]], it is a metal or embroidered chest device worn on the left side primary or secondary position of the uniform. Once qualified, EDOs can wear this insignia according to U.S. Navy uniform regulations (December 22, 2017). Warfare-qualified EDOs have the option of wearing the EDO insignia in the secondary position since warfare devices take precedence over the EDO qualification insignia.

==Areas of specialization==
Current EDOs serve in one of several career fields, including:
*[[Program Executive Officer|Program]] management of surface [[United States Navy ships|ships]], [[List of submarines of the United States Navy|submarines]], [[List of United States Navy weapons|weapons and combat systems]], and [[C4ISTAR|Information Warfare (C4ISR)]] systems. 
*Maintenance of surface ships and submarines at [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard|naval shipyards]] and smaller-scale maintenance facilities.
*[[Naval Sea Systems Command|Naval Sea Systems]] and [[Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command|Space &amp; Naval Warfare Systems]] engineering.
*[[United States Navy Diver|Underwater ship husbandry, diving, and salvage]].
*The [[Naval Reactors|Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program]].

==History==
The importance of engineering duty officers in United States Navy history is memorialized in a [[Bronze sculpture|bronze]] [[bas-relief]] by American sculptor [[Antonio Tobias Mendez|Antonio Tobias "Toby" Mendez]] [http://www.tobymendezstudios.com/Artist.asp?ArtistID=10003&amp;AKey=E4WXEJ7W], on the sculpture wall at the [[United States Navy Memorial]] in Washington DC, entitled "Engineering Duty Officers – 'Sharpening the Point of the Spear.' "[http://www.navymemorial.org/About/WhatCanYouSeeHere/TheMemorialPlaza/BronzeReliefSculptures/EngineeringDutyOfficers/tabid/216/Default.aspx]  This is one of 26 such reliefs along the southern hemisphere of the Granite Sea at the Navy Memorial, which commemorate events, personnel, and communities of the various sea services.

The [[Badges of the United States Navy|breast insignia]] of the EDO, first issued in January 2018, was spearheaded by Capt. Huan Nguyen, with the support of Rear Adm. [[Alma Grocki]] and Rear Adm. Ronald Fritzemeier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Navy Approves New Engineering Duty Officer Qualification Insignia|url=http://www.navsea.navy.mil/Media/News/Article/1443380/navy-approves-new-engineering-duty-officer-qualification-insignia/|accessdate=20 May 2018|work=Naval Sea Systems Command|date=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An '''Extended Validation Certificate''' (EV) is a [[public key certificate|certificate]] used for HTTPS [[website]]s and [[software]] that proves the [[legal entity]] controlling the website or software package. Obtaining an EV certificate requires verification of the requesting entity's identity by a [[certificate authority]] (CA). 

[[Web browser]]s show the verified legal identity prominently in their [[user interface]], either before, or instead of, the [[domain name]]. For [[software]], the verified legal identity is displayed to the user by the [[operating system]] (e.g., [[Microsoft Windows]]) before proceeding with the installation.

EV certificates use the same [[Encryption software|encryption]] as [[public key certificate#Organization validation|organization-validated certificates]] and [[Domain-validated certificate|domain-validated certificates]]: the increase in security is due to the identity validation process, which is indicated within the certificate by the policy identifier.

The criteria for issuing EV certificates are defined by the ''Guidelines for Extended Validation''&lt;ref&gt;https://cabforum.org/extended-validation/&lt;/ref&gt;, currently (as of December 13, 2017) at version 1.6.6. The guidelines are produced by the [[CA/Browser Forum]], a voluntary organization whose members include leading CAs and vendors of Internet software, as well as representatives from the legal and audit professions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cabforum.org/forum.html CA/Browser Forum Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 2005 [[Melih Abdulhayoglu]], CEO of the [[Comodo Group]], convened the first meeting of the organization that became the [[CA/Browser Forum]], hoping to improve standards for issuing SSL/TLS certificates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/How-Can-We-Improve-Code-Signing/&lt;/ref&gt; On June 12, 2007, the CA/Browser Forum officially ratified the first version of the Extended Validation (EV) SSL Guidelines, which took effect immediately. The formal approval successfully brought to a close more than two years of effort, and provided the infrastructure for trusted Web site identity on the Internet. Then, in April 2008, the Forum announced version 1.1 of the Guidelines, building on the practical experience of its member CAs and relying-party [[application software]] suppliers gained in the months since the first version was approved for use.

== Motivation ==
An important motivation for using digital certificates with [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]] was to add trust to online transactions by requiring website operators to undergo vetting with a certificate authority (CA) in order to get a certificate.

However, commercial pressures have led some CAs to introduce "[[Domain-validated certificate|domain-validated]]" certificates. Domain-validated certificates existed before validation standards, and generally only require some proof of domain control. In particular, domain-validated certificates do not assert that a given legal entity has any relationship with the domain, although the domain may resemble a particular legal entity.

In the past, most browsers' user interfaces did not clearly differentiate between low-validation certificates and those that have undergone more rigorous vetting. Since any successful [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]] connection would cause a green padlock icon to appear in most browsers{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}, users were not likely to be aware of whether the website owner has been validated or not. As a result, fraudsters (including [[phishing]] websites) could use TLS to add perceived credibility to their websites. Users of modern browsers can always check the identity of certificate owners by examining the details of the issued certificate which always indicates the certificate owner information such as the name of the organization and its location.

EV certificates are validated against both the Baseline Requirements and the Extended Validation requirements, which place additional requirements on how authorities vet companies. These include manual checks of all the domain names requested by the applicant, checks against official government sources, checks against independent information sources, and phone calls to the company to confirm the position of the applicant. If the certificate is accepted, the government-registered serial number of the business as well as the physical address are stored in the EV certificate.

By establishing stricter issuing criteria and requiring consistent application of those criteria by all participating CAs, EV certificates are intended to restore confidence among users that a website operator is a legally established business or organization with a verifiable identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=William Hendric |title= What is an EV SSL certificate?|url=https://ssl.comodo.com/ev-ssl-certificates.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That said, there is still the concern that the same lack of accountability that led to the loss of public confidence in [[domain-validated certificate]]s will lead to lax certification practices that will erode the value of EV certificates as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hagai Bar-El |title=The Inevitable Collapse of the Certificate Model|publisher=Hagai Bar-El on Security |url=https://www.hbarel.com/analysis/itsec/the-inevitable-collapse-of-the}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issuing criteria ==
Only CAs who pass an independent qualified audit review may offer EV,&lt;ref&gt;https://cabforum.org/audit-criteria/&lt;/ref&gt; and all CAs globally must follow the same detailed issuance requirements which aim to:

* Establish the legal identity as well as the operational and physical presence of website owner.
* Establish that the applicant is the domain name owner or has exclusive control over the domain name.
* Confirm the identity and authority of the individuals acting for the website owner, and that documents pertaining to legal obligations are signed by an authorised officer.

With the exception&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cabforum.org/2015/02/18/ballot-144-validation-rules-dot-onion-names/|title=Ballot 144 – Validation rules for .onion names; Appendix F section 4|last=|first=|date=|website=CA/Browser Forum|access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Extended Validation Certificates for [[.onion]] domains, it is otherwise not possible to get a [[Wildcard certificate|wildcard]] Extended Validation Certificate – instead, all fully qualified domain names must be included in the certificate and inspected by the certificate authority.&lt;ref&gt;
  {{cite web

      | title= Guidelines For The Issuance And Management Of Extended Validation Certificates, Version 1.5.2

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== User interface ==
Browsers with EV support display the validated identity – usually a combination of organization name and jurisdiction – contained in the EV certificate's 'subject' field. [[Microsoft]] [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and [[Google Chrome]] all provide EV support.

The Extended Validation guidelines require participating certificate authorities to assign a specific EV identifier, which is registered with the browser vendors who support EV once the certificate authority has completed an independent audit and met other criteria. The browser matches the EV identifier in the certificate with the one it has registered for the CA in question: if they match, and the certificate is verified as current, the certificate receives the enhanced EV display in the browser's user interface.  In most implementations, the enhanced display includes:

* The name of the company or entity that owns the certificate.
* A distinctive color, usually green, shown in the [[address bar]] to indicate that a valid EV certificate was received.
* A lock symbol, also in the address bar, that varies in color depending on the security status of the website.

By clicking on the lock symbol you can obtain more information about the certificate, including the name of the certificate authority (CA) that issued the EV certificate.

== Compatibility ==
Most of the Extended Validation Certificates are compatible with the following browsers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://knowledge.verisign.com/support/ssl-certificates-support/index?page=content&amp;id=SO10090&amp;actp=search&amp;viewlocale=en_US&amp;searchid=1406590748892|title=What browsers support Extended Validation (EV) and display an EV indicator?|publisher=[[Symantec]]|accessdate=2014-07-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231171309/https://knowledge.verisign.com/support/ssl-certificates-support/index?page=content&amp;id=SO10090&amp;actp=search&amp;viewlocale=en_US&amp;searchid=1406590748892|archivedate=2015-12-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Microsoft Edge]] 12+
* [[Google Chrome]] 1.0+
* [[Internet Explorer]] 7.0+
* [[Firefox]] 3+
* [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] 3.2+
* [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] 9.5+

=== Supported mobile device browsers ===
* Safari for iOS
* Windows Phone
* Firefox for Android
* Chrome for Android and iOS

=== Web server support ===
As the necessary attributes to identify the legal entity and jurisdiction are included inside the certificate, Extended Validation supports all [[web servers]] supporting [[HTTPS]].

== Extended Validation certificate identification ==
EV certificates are standard X.509 digital certificates. The primary way to identify an EV certificate is by referencing the Certificate Policies extension field. Each issuer uses a different [[object identifier]] (OID) in this field to identify their EV certificates, and each OID is documented in the issuer's Certification Practice Statement. As with root certificate authorities in general, browsers may not recognize all issuers.

EV HTTPS certificates contain a subject with X.509 OIDs for &lt;code&gt;jurisdictionOfIncorporationCountryName&lt;/code&gt;,  &lt;code&gt;businessCategory&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;serialNumber&lt;/code&gt;, with the &lt;code&gt;serialNumber&lt;/code&gt; pointing to the ID at the relevant secretary of state (US) or government business registrar (outside US), as well as a CA-specific policy identifier so that EV-aware software, such as a [[web browser]], can recognize them.

== Online Certificate Status Protocol ==
{{Main article|Online Certificate Status Protocol}}

The criteria for issuing Extended Validation certificates do not require issuing certificate authorities to immediately support Online Certificate Status Protocol for revocation checking. However, the requirement for a timely response to revocation checks by the browser has prompted most certificate authorities that had not previously done so to implement OCSP support. Section 26-A of the issuing criteria requires CAs to support OCSP checking for all certificates issued after Dec. 31, 2010.

In 2006, researchers at [[Stanford University]] and [[Microsoft Research]] conducted a usability study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=Collin|last=Jackson|author2=Daniel R. Simon |author3=Desney S. Tan |author4=Adam Barth |title=An Evaluation of Extended Validation and Picture-in-Picture Phishing Attacks|booktitle=Usable Security 2007|url=http://www.usablesecurity.org/papers/jackson.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the EV display in [[Internet Explorer 7]]. Their paper concluded that "participants who received no training in browser security features did not notice the extended validation indicator and did not outperform the control group", whereas "participants who were asked to read the Internet Explorer help file were more likely to classify both real and fake sites as legitimate".

===Domain-validated certificates were created by CAs in the first place===

While proponents of EV Certificates claim they help against phishing attacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.digicert.com/extended-validation-ev-ssl.htm |title=Common Questions About Extended Validation EV SSL |publisher=DigiCert, Inc. |accessdate=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; security expert [[Peter Gutmann (computer scientist)|Peter Gutmann]] states the new class of certificates restore a CA's profits which were eroded due to the [[race to the bottom]] that occurred among issuers in the industry. Gutmann calls this phenomenon "PKI-Me-Harder".

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The introduction &amp;hellip; of so-called high-assurance or extended validation (EV) certificates that allow CAs to charge more for them than standard ones, is simply a case of rounding up twice the usual number of suspects—presumably somebody’s going to be impressed by it, but the effect on phishing is minimal since it is not fixing any problem that the phishers are exploiting. Indeed, cynics would say that this was exactly the problem that certificates and CAs were supposed to solve in the first place, and that “high-assurance” certificates are just a way of charging a second time for an existing service. A few years ago certificates still cost several hundred dollars, but now that the shifting baseline of certificate prices and quality has moved to the point where they can be obtained for $9.95 (or even for nothing at all) the big commercial CAs have had to reinvent themselves by defining a new standard and convincing the market to go back to the prices paid in the good old days.

This deja-vu-all-over-again approach can be seen by examining Verisign’s certificate practice statement (CPS), the document that governs its certificate issuance. The security requirements in the EV-certificate 2008 CPS are (except for minor differences in the legalese used to express them) practically identical to the requirements for Class 3 certificates listed in Verisign’s version 1.0 CPS from 1996. EV certificates simply roll back the clock to the approach that had already failed the first time it was tried in 1996, resetting the shifting baseline and charging 1996 prices as a side-effect. There have even been proposals for a kind of sliding-window approach to certificate value in which, as the inevitable race to the bottom cheapens the effective value of established classes of certificates, they’re regarded as less and less effective by the software that uses them&amp;hellip;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gutmann |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Gutmann (computer scientist) |year=2014 |title=Engineering Security |pages=73 |url=https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/book.pdf |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:明朝的神機箭.jpg|thumb|400px|Depiction of fire arrows known as "divine engine arrows" (shen ji jian 神機箭) from the ''[[Wubei Zhi]]''.]]

'''Fire arrows''' were one of the earliest forms of weaponized [[gunpowder]], being used from the 9th century onward. Not to be confused with earlier incendiary arrow projectiles, the fire arrow was a gunpowder weapon which receives its name from the translated Chinese term ''huǒjiàn'' (火箭), which literally means fire arrow. In China a 'fire arrow' referred to a gunpowder projectile consisting of a bag of incendiary gunpowder attached to the shaft of an arrow . Fire arrows are the predecessors of [[fire lance]]s, the first firearm.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=31}}

Later [[rocket]]s utilizing gunpowder were used to provide arrows with propulsive force and the term ''fire arrow'' became synonymous with rockets in the [[Chinese language]]. In other languages such as [[Sanskrit]] 'fire arrow' (''agni astra'') underwent a different semantic shift and became synonymous with 'cannon.'{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=68}}

[[File:Gong she huo shi liu jian.png|thumb|A fire arrow from the ''[[Wubei Zhi]]'']]

Although the fire arrow is most commonly associated with its [[rocket]] mechanism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blrockethistory.htm The History of Early Fireworks and Fire Arrows] — About.com&lt;/ref&gt; it originally consisted of a pouch of [[gunpowder]] attached to an arrow. This type of fire arrow served the function of an incendiary and was launched using a bow or crossbow.

According to the [[Wujing Zongyao]] the fire arrow was constructed and used in the following manner:

{{quotation|Behind the arrow-head wrap up some gunpowder with two or three layers of soft paper, and bind it to the arrow shaft in a lump shaped like a pomegranate. Cover it with a piece of hemp cloth tightly tied, and sealed fast with molten pine resin. Light the fuse and then shoot it off from a bow.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=154}}|[[Wujing Zongyao]]}}

Incendiary gunpowder weapons had an advantage over previous incendiaries by using their own built-in oxygen supply to create flames, and was therefore harder to put out, similar to [[Greek Fire]]. However unlike Greek Fire, gunpowder's physical properties are solid rather than liquid, which makes it easier to store and load.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=154}}

The rocket propelled fire arrow appeared later. By the mid 1300s rocket arrow launchers had appeared in the [[Ming dynasty]] and later on mobile rocket arrow launchers were utilized in both China and Korea. The fire arrows propelled by gunpowder may have had a range of up to 1,000 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceline.org/history/1.html |title=History of Rocketry: Ancient times to the 17th Century |publisher=Spaceline.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|History of gunpowder|Timeline of the Gunpowder Age}}

Fire arrows were first reported to have been used by the [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Southern Wu]] in 904 during the siege of [[Nanchang|Yuzhang]].{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=31}}

In 969 gunpowder propelled rocket arrows were invented by Yue Yifang and Feng Jisheng.{{sfn|Liang|2006}}

Published in 1044, the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'', or ''Complete Compendium of Military Classics'', states that in 994 A.D. the city of Zitong was attacked by an army of 100,000 men who were driven back by regular war machines and fire arrows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HXGFJYh1sEoC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=in+994+A.D.+the+Chinese+used+fire+arrows+in+battle.&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mAXWTuKPM-iDsgLK04m2Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age'' (Google eBook), William E. Burrows, Random House Digital, Inc., Nov 5, 1999P.8]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1083 Song records state that the court produced 350,000 fire arrows and sent them to two garrisons.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}}

On March 1, 1126, the [[Song dynasty|Song]] general Li Gang used a fire arrow machine known as the ''Thunderbolt Thrower'' during the [[Jingkang Incident]].&lt;ref&gt;（靖康元年二月六日）是夕，宿于咸丰门，以金人进兵门外，治攻具故。先是，蔡楙号令将士，金人近城不得辄施放，有引炮及发床子弩者，皆杖之，将士愤怒。余（李纲）既登城，令施放，有引炮自便，能中（金）贼者，厚赏。夜，发「霹雳炮」以击，（金）贼军皆惊呼。(Rough Translation: [On March 1, 1126 (Gregorian calendar)] In the evening, I slept at the gate of Xianfeng, as the Jin army arrived at the gate and nourishing their weapons. Earlier, Cai Mao had ordered the men that they were not allowed to fire on the Jin soldiers whoever came near, any firing from trebuchets and ballistas were to be caned, and the soldiers were irritate by the order. Once arrived at the walls, I had ordered them to fire, for those who could hit the enemy were to be extensively rewarded. At night, they launched the "thunderbolt pao" at the enemy, and they were all shocked.) Records of Messages from the Jingkang Era ch. 2 (author: Li Gang)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1127 the Jin were also using fire arrows produced by captured Song artisans.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=34-35}}

In 1159 fire arrows were used by the Song navy in sinking a Jin fleet.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=39}}

In 1161 the general [[Yu Yunwen]] used fire arrows at the [[Battle of Caishi]], near present-day [[Ma'anshan]], during a Jin maritime incursion.&lt;ref&gt;（绍兴辛已年）我舟伏于七宝山后，令曰：「旗举则出江！」。先使一骑偃旗于山之顶，伺其半济，忽山上卓立一旗，舟师自山下河中两旁突出大江，人在舟中，踏车以行船。但见船行如飞，而不见有人，（金）虏以为纸船也。舟中忽发一「霹雳炮」，盖以纸为之，而实之以石灰、硫黄。炮自空而下落水中，硫黄得水而火作，自水跳出，其声如雷，纸裂而石灰散为烟雾，眯其人马之目，人物不相见。(Rough Translation: [Year 1161] Once our ships had hid behind the Mount Qibao, an order was given to launch out followed after the signal. Earlier, a mounted scout was sent atop the peak to watch over half cross the river, suddenly a signal was shown from the peak, and the ships came out from the river on both sides at the foot, all men on board tread as to move the ship. The ships seemed to move swiftly without sails or oars, so the savages [Jin] conceived that those were paper boats. Then, the paddle wheelers launched the "thunderbolt pao" at their enemy on a sudden, which were made of paper pots, packed with lime and sulfur. When alight, they exploded upon impact with the water, and bounce out, making a noise like thunder. The pots were cracked and lime scattered into a smoky fog, blinding and terrifying the enemy men and horses.) Collection from the Sincerity Studio ch. 44 (author: [[Yang Wanli]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mongols]] also made use of the fire arrow during their campaigns in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RL4OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Japanese+fire+arrow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MlsyT5m9JY6ItweZrPHYBg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Japanese%20fire%20arrow&amp;f=true ''The Rocket''], New Cavendish books, 1978 {{ISBN|0-904568-10-5}} P.10&lt;/ref&gt; Probably as a result of the Mongolian military campaigns the fire arrow later spread into the [[Middle East]], where they were mentioned by [[Hasan al-Rammah]] in the late 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U2lyDeRpo5EC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Singijeon+fire+arrow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ljQ3T5PAI5C2twfcsqy7Ag&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Singijeon%20fire%20arrow&amp;f=true ''The Rocket''], New Cavendish books, 1978 {{ISBN|0-904568-10-5}} P.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1374 the kingdom of [[Joseon]] also started producing gunpowder and by 1377 were producing fire arrows and cannons, which they used against [[wokou]] pirates.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=173}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:8erR2mluxYcJ:www.koreanhero.net/fiftywonders/FiftyWonders2_English.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjsozg5IL81-jP_Lw-c-YL2MBdYFKnU8_7GBsZr_A84mNbnR5pOLhN2e-Xc7Fdk7NAgj5IngazAUFsal8IkrPON2hNB_HQcwfX7rruPJY6-ZoJqyOFNZ22EaMKTWCN30jxkPAIu&amp;sig=AHIEtbRdGS56TF8sFZ4ooExjoVUlZJgJqg Fifty Wonders of Korea], Volume 2, Korean Spirit and Culture Series, Authors	Korean Spirit &amp; Culture Promotion Project, Diamond Sutra Recitation Group, Publisher Korean Spirit &amp; Culture Promotion Project, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-9797263-4-7}} P.51-60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9sawofv6lJsC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=hwajeon+fire+arrow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4xyVT4z6BsLqtgfCs8i1Cw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hwajeon%20fire%20arrow&amp;f=false ''Science and Technology in Korean History: Excursions, Innovations, and Issues''], Jain Publishing Company, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-89581-838-6}} P.82&lt;/ref&gt; Korean fire arrows were used against the Japanese during the invasion of Korea (1592).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1fb7tBwv4ZYC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=korean+fire+arrow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sTU3T77nGsnMtgeHpczBAg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=korean%20fire%20arrow&amp;f=true ''Fighting techniques of the Oriental world, AD 1200-1860: equipment, combat skills, and tactics Fighting Techniques''], Authors Michael E.

In 1380 an order of "wasp nest" arrow rocket launchers were ordered by the Ming army and in 1400 rocket launchers were recorded to have been used by [[Li Jinglong]].{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=514}}

In 1451 a type of mobile arrow rocket launcher known as the "Munjong [[Hwacha]]" was invented in Joseon.&lt;ref name="Annals Of the Joseon Dynasty-Munjong"&gt;{{cite web| title = Articles of 1451, Munjongsillok of Annals of Joseon Dynasty (from book 5 to 9, click 문종 for view)| publisher = National Institute of Korean History| year = 1451| url = http://sillok.history.go.kr/inspection/inspection.jsp?mState=2&amp;mTree=0&amp;clsName=&amp;searchType=a&amp;keyword=화차| accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese version of the fire arrow was known as [[Bo-hiya (Japanese fire arrow)|''bo-hiya'']]. Japanese pirates ([[wokou]] also, kaizoku or wako) in the 16th century were reported to have used bo hiya which had the appearance of a large arrow. A burning element made from incendiary waterproof rope was wrapped around the shaft and when lit the bo-hiya was fired from a wide bore [[tanegashima (Japanese matchlock)]] or a mortar-like weapon [[Commons:Category:Hiya taihou (fire arrow cannon)|(''hiya taihou'')]]. During one sea battle it was said the  bo-hiya were "falling like rain".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=__9EEed9bugC&amp;pg=PT34&amp;dq=bohiya&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WDfgTeDaGcbZ0QGm6O3OCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Pirate of the Far East: 811-1639'', Stephen Turnbull, Osprey Publishing, Nov 20, 2007 P.34]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rocket invention==
The dating of the appearance of the gunpowder propelled fire arrow, otherwise known as a [[rocket]], more specifically a [[solid-propellant rocket]], is disputed. The [[History of Song]] attributes the invention to two different people at different times, [[Feng Zhisheng]] in 969 and [[Tang Fu]] in 1000. However [[Joseph Needham]] argues that rockets could not have existed prior to the 12th century since the gunpowder formulas listed in the [[Wujing Zongyao]] are not suitable as rocket propellant.{{sfn|Lorge|2005}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4344">A '''ghost restaurant''' (also known as a '''delivery-only restaurant''' or '''online-only restaurant''') is a food service business that serves customers exclusively through [[online food delivery]]. Without the need to interact with customers directly on the premises, ghost restaurants can offset the high cost of a delivery system with cheaper real estate and operations. 

Although restaurants typically earn more from customers who dine at the restaurant, due to the expense of operating a delivery service or the fees charged by third party delivery companies like [[Grubhub]] and Caviar, ghost restaurants have significantly lower overhead. Operating a dining room, with the real estate it requires, staff, amenities, insurance, and other expenses, is a significant cost.&lt;ref name=eater30september2016/&gt; Even restaurants with considerable to-go business traditionally dedicate the majority of their space to seating.&lt;ref name=fastcompany/&gt; As visibility, [[curb appeal]], foot traffic, and accessibility are not concerns, the kitchen can be housed in an inexpensive location that would not typically be considered desirable for a restaurant.

A single company may operate several ghost restaurants, and a single location's kitchen and staff can function as multiple branded restaurants.&lt;ref name=crains/&gt; Without a brick-and-mortar location to renovate, companies can also try out new brands and cuisines with little effort, to appeal to changing tastes and trends.&lt;ref name=crains/&gt;&lt;ref name=fastcompany/&gt;

Most of the restaurants utilize existing delivery services. For example, Green Summit, which owns several ghost restaurants in New York City and partners with Grubhub.&lt;ref name=fastcompany/&gt; Some companies incorporate their own delivery system into the business model, like the New York-based company Maple.&lt;ref name=fastcompany/&gt;&lt;ref name=kessler/&gt; Maple, which is backed by restaurateur [[David Chang]], is able to orient its business around productivity in terms of meals per hour per kitchen &amp;mdash; a metric more typical of [[fast food]] restaurants.&lt;ref name=kessler/&gt;

Several 2015 news articles exposed a sub-segment of operations they termed "ghost restaurants", which operate as unregulated, unlicensed standalone entities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelosangelesbeat.com/2015/07/have-you-missed-starry-kitchens-balls-us-too-uber-eats-is-here-to-save-us/|title=Have You Missed Starry Kitchen’s Balls?

[[Image:Seal Swim Goggles.jpg|right|thumb|SealMask watersport goggles made by AquaSphere]]
'''Goggles''', or '''safety glasses''', are forms of [[Eye protection|protective eyewear]] that usually enclose or protect the area surrounding the eye in order to prevent particulates, water or [[chemical]]s from striking the [[human eye|eye]]s. They are used in [[chemistry]] laboratories and in [[woodworking]]. They are often used in snow sports as well, and in [[swimming (sport)|swimming]]. Goggles are often worn when using [[power tool]]s such as [[drill]]s or [[chainsaw]]s to prevent flying particles from damaging the eyes. Many types of goggles are available as prescription goggles for those with vision problems.

== History ==
The [[Inuit]] and [[Yupik people]]  carved [[Inuit snow goggles]] from [[reindeer|caribou]] [[antler]],  wood, and shell to help prevent [[snow blindness]]. The goggles were curved to fit the user's face and had a large groove cut in the back to allow for the nose. A long thin slit was cut through the goggles to allow in a small amount of light, diminishing subsequent [[ultraviolet]] rays. The goggles were held to the head by a cord made of caribou [[tendon|sinew]].

In the early 20th century, goggles were worn by drivers of uncovered cars to prevent irritation of the eyes by dust or wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred C. Harmsworth|title=Motors and Motor-driving|year=1904|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oqwEAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise in the first ten years after the invention of the airplane in 1903 goggles became a necessity as wind blow became more severe as aircraft speeds increased and as protection against bugstrikes at high altitudes. The first pilot to wear goggles was probably Charles Manly in his failed attempt to fly [[Samuel Langley|Samuel Langley's]] aerodrome in 1903.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Types==
The requirements for goggles varies depending on the use. Some examples:
* Cold weather: Most modern cold-weather goggles have two layers of [[Lens (optics)|lens]] to prevent the interior from becoming "foggy". With only a single lens, the interior [[water vapor]] condenses onto the lens because the lens is colder than the vapor, although [[anti-fog]] agents can be used. The reasoning behind the dual layer lens is that the inner lens will be warm while the outer lens will be cold. As long as the temperature of the inner lens is close to that of the interior water vapor, the vapor should not condense. However, if water vapor gets between the layers of the lens, condensation can occur between the lenses and is almost impossible to get rid of; thus, properly constructed and maintained dual layer lenses should be airtight to prevent water vapor from entering between the lenses.
* [[Human swimming|Swimming]]: Must be watertight to prevent water, such as [[Seawater|salt water]] when swimming in the [[ocean]], or [[Chlorine|chlorinated]] water when swimming in a pool, from irritating the eyes or blurring vision. Allow swimmers to see clearly underwater. They will not be usable more than a few feet underwater, because the water pressure will press them tightly against the face. (Below this limit, a [[diving mask]] must be used, which allows the user to equalize pressure by exhaling air through the nose.) Examples of these include [[Swedish goggles]].
* [[Power tool]]s: Must be made of an unbreakable material that prevents chunks of metal, wood, plastic, concrete, and so on from hitting or piercing the eye, usually [[polycarbonate]].  Usually has some sort of ventilation to prevent sweat from building up inside the goggles and fogging the surface.
* [[Blowtorch goggles]]: These protect the eyes from glare and flying sparks and hot metal splashes while using or near a [[blowtorch]]. They are '''not''' the correct filters for [[arc welding]].
* [[Welding goggles]]: Includes all goggles for eye protection during welding or cutting. They provide protection against debris, the heat from welding, and, with the proper filters, the optical radiation resulting from the welding, which can otherwise cause [[arc eye]].
* [[Motorcycle]] riding and other open-air activities: Prevents insects, dust, and so on from hitting the eyes.
* [[Laboratory]] and [[research]]: Combines impact resistance with side shields to prevent chemical splashes reaching the eyes. May also include [[Laser safety|laser protection]] which would be covered by [[EN 207]] (Europe) and ANSI Z 136 (United States). Examples of these include [[dark adaptor goggles|red adaptation goggles]].
* [[Racquetball]]: Protect the eyes from racquets swinging in an enclosed area and from impact from hard rubber ball.
* [[Winter sport|Winter sports]]: Protect the eyes from glare and from icy particles flying up from the ground. Double lens anti-fog ski goggles were invented and patented by Robert Earl "Bob" Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/olympics/story/ski-goggle-pioneer-bob-smith-dies-042712 |title=Ski goggle pioneer Bob Smith dies |publisher=Msn.foxsports.com |date=2012-04-27 |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|US|4528701}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|US| 4428081}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Astronomy]] and [[meteorology]]: [[dark adaptor goggles]] are used before going outside at night, in order to help the eyes adapt to the dark.
* [[Basketball]]: Several [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] players have worn goggles during play, including [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[James Worthy]], [[Horace Grant]], [[Kurt Rambis]] and [[Amar'e Stoudemire]]; they prevent a fellow player from scratching or hitting the eyes when trying to grab the basketball. In most circumstances, a player starts wearing protective goggles to prevent ''further'' injury to the eyes.
* [[Aviation]]: In open [[cockpit]] aircraft, such as old [[biplane]]s, [[aviator]]s, such as [[Amelia Earhart]] and [[Charles Kingsford Smith]], would wear goggles to help protect from the wind and are still in use today. Examples of these include the [[AN-6530 goggles]].
* [[Virtual reality]]: A virtual reality headset, sometimes called "goggles", is a wrap-around visual interface to display computer output. Commonly the computer display information is presented as a three-dimensional representation of real-world environments.
* [[Drunk]]enness: Goggles designed to simulate the vision altering effects of [[psychoactive drugs]], in particular [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol.]] Examples include [[Fatal Vision (goggles)|Fatal Vision goggles]].

== Fashion ==
Goggles are often worn as a fashion statement in certain subcultures, most often as part of the [[cybergoth]] subculture. They are usually worn over the eyes or up on the forehead to secure 'falls': a type of long, often brightly coloured, synthetic hairpiece. Fans of the [[steampunk]] genre or subculture also frequently wear steampunk-styled goggles, particularly when performing in a [[live action role-playing game]].

Goggles are also frequently used by [[anime]] and [[manga]] characters as a fashion statement. For example, it is an idiosyncrasy of team leader characters in the ''[[Digimon]]'' anime to wear goggles. Other notable characters who wear goggles are the young [[Naruto Uzumaki]] and Konohamaru from [[Naruto]],  Matt from ''[[Death Note]]'' and [[Usopp]] from ''[[One Piece]]''.

==Non-human==
[[Image:Picador.JPG|thumb|Bullfighting horse wearing eye protection]]
[[Image:Military dog in Afghanistan being prepared for a helicopter hoist.jpg|thumb|A [[US Military]] working dog attached to a helicopter hoist in Afghanistan.]]
Goggles are available for [[horse]]s used in speed sports such as [[horse racing]].&lt;ref&gt;Landers T. A. (2006) Professional Care of the Racehorse, Revised Edition: A Guide to Grooming, Feeding, and Handling the Equine Athlete.  Blood Horse Publications. 308 pages. Page 138.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some traditions of horse mounted [[bullfighting]], the horse may wear a protective cloth over its eyes.

Goggles have been used on military working dogs, for protection in harsh conditions, such as sandstorms and rotorwash from helicopters. One of the brands of these types of goggles are [[Doggles]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6428">'''Stress test''' (sometimes called a '''torture test''') is a form of deliberately intense and thorough testing used to determine the stability of a given system or entity. It involves testing beyond normal operational capacity, often to a breaking point, in order to observe the results. Reasons can include: to determine breaking points and safe usage limits; to confirm that the intended specifications are being met; to determine modes of failure (how exactly a system may fail), and to test stable operation of a part or system outside standard usage. [[Reliability engineering|Reliability engineer]]s often test items under expected stress or even under accelerated stress in order to determine the operating life of the item or to determine [[failure causes|modes of failure]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Wayne B., (2004), ''Accelerated Testing - Statistical Models, Test Plans, and Data Analysis'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, {{ISBN|0-471-69736-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''stress test'' as it relates to hardware (including electronics, physical devices, nuclear power plants, etc.) is likely to have different refined meanings in specific contexts. One example is in materials, ''see [[Fatigue (material)]]''. 

==Hardware stress test==
Stress testing, in general, should put computer hardware under exaggerated levels of stress in order to ensure stability when used in a normal environment. These can include extremes of workload, type of task, memory use, thermal load (heat), clock speed, or voltages. Memory and CPU are two components that are commonly stress tested in this way.

There is considerable overlap between stress testing software and benchmarking software, since both seek to assess and measure maximum performance. Of the two, stress testing software aims to test stability by trying to force a system to fail; benchmarking aims to measure and assess the maximum performance possible at a given task or function.

When modifying the operating parameters of a [[central processing unit|CPU]], such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[overclocking]], [[underclocking]], [[overvolting]], and [[undervolting]], it may be necessary to verify if the new parameters (usually [[CPU core voltage]] and [[Clock rate|frequency]]) are suitable for heavy [[load (computing)|CPU load]]s. This is done by running a CPU-intensive program for extended periods of time, to test whether the computer [[Hang (computing)|hangs]] or [[crash (computing)|crashes]]. CPU stress testing is also referred to as '''torture testing'''. Software that is suitable for torture testing should typically run [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] that utilise the entire chip rather than only a few of its units. Stress testing a CPU over the course of 24 hours at 100% load is, in most cases, sufficient to determine that the CPU will function correctly in normal usage scenarios such as in a desktop computer, where CPU usage typically fluctuates at low levels (50% and under).

Hardware stress testing and stability are subjective and may vary according to how the system will be used. A stress test for a system running 24/7 or that will perform error sensitive tasks such as [[distributed computing]] or [[folding@home|"folding" projects]] may differ from one that needs to be able to run a single game with reasonably reliability. For example, a comprehensive guide on overclocking [[Sandy Bridge]] found that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sin0822|title=Sandy Bridge E Overclocking Guide: Walk through, Explanations, and Support for all X79|url=http://www.overclock.net/t/1189242/sandy-bridge-e-overclocking-guide-walk-through-explanations-and-support-for-all-x79-overclockers/0_100|publisher=overclock.net|accessdate=2 February 2013|date=2011-12-24}} ''(some text condensed)''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Even though in the past IntelBurnTest was just as good, it seems that something in the SB uArch [Sandy Bridge microarchitecture] is more heavily stressed with Prime95 ... IBT really does pull more power [make greater thermal demands]. But ... Prime95 failed first every time, and it failed when IBT would pass. So same as Sandy Bridge, Prime95 is a better stability tester for Sandy Bridge-E than IBT/LinX.

Stability is subjective; some might call stability enough to run their game, other like folders [folding projects] might need something that is just as stable as it was at stock, and ... would need to run Prime95 for at least 12 hours to a day or two to deem that stable ... There are [bench testers] who really don’t care for stability like that and will just say if it can [complete] a benchmark it is stable enough. No one is wrong and no one is right. Stability is subjective. [But] 24/7 stability is not subjective.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An engineer at [[ASUS]] advised in a 2012 article on [[overclocking]] an [[Intel]] [[X79]] system, that it is important to choose testing software carefully in order to obtain useful results:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Juan Jose Guerrero III - ASUS|title=Intel X79 Motherboard Overclocking Guide|url=http://benchmarkreviews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=834&amp;Itemid=38|publisher=benchmarkreviews.com|accessdate=2 February 2013|date=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unvalidated stress tests are not advised (such as [[Prime95]] or LinX or other comparable applications). For high grade CPU/IMC and System Bus testing Aida64 is recommended along with general applications usage like PC Mark 7. Aida has an advantage as it is stability test has been designed for the Sandy Bridge E architecture and test specific functions like AES, AVX and other instruction sets that prime and like synthetics do not touch. As such not only does it load the CPU 100% but will also test other parts of CPU not used under applications like Prime 95. Other applications to consider are SiSoft 2012 or Passmark BurnIn. Be advised validation has not been completed using Prime 95 version 26 and LinX (10.3.7.012) and OCCT 4.1.0 beta 1 but once we have internally tested to ensure at least limited support and operation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''High-Definition Audio-Video Network Alliance''' (HANA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://hanaalliance.org/ Hanaallilance.org]&lt;/ref&gt; was a cross-industry collaboration of members addressing the end-to-end needs of connected, HD, home entertainment products and services. The organization was formed by leading companies from the four industries most affected by the HD revolution: content providers, [[consumer electronics]], [[service provider]]s and [[information technology]]. HANA worked to create design guidelines for secure high-definition audio-video networks that would speed the creation of new, high quality, easy to use HD products. HANA membership was open to all companies involved in the digital entertainment industry. HANA was dissolved in September 2009 and the [[IEEE 1394 interface|1394]] Trade Association assumed control of all HANA-generated intellectual property.

==Overview==
HANA was incorporated in October 2005 and formally launched in December 2005. HANA's mission was to provide consumers with a simple way to connect and enjoy HD entertainment anywhere in the home. The organisation's goal were to create standards-based solutions to facilitate commercial deployment of connected products and services that would enhance the consumer HD entertainment experience.

==Benefits of HANA==

;Consumers
:HANA’s focus was to deliver products that would simplify consumers’ lives by eliminating the difficulties associated with connecting and controlling their entertainment devices. Consumers should be able to:
:*View, pause and record more than five HD channels simultaneously with full [[quality of service]] (QoS)
:*Share personal content between the IT and AV networks while protecting commercial HD content from piracy
:*Control all AV devices and access content with just a single remote per room
:*Use just a single cable to connect devices rather than multiple cables between all devices
;Content providers
:By creating a secure [[home network]] environment that respects the rights of content owners, multichannel video service providers and broadcasters, HANA can give consumers flexible and convenient access to more high-value HD content. In particular, the incorporation of [[digital rights management]] (DRM) and watermark verification of copyrighted content in the HANA architecture are key to ensuring that HD content can flow seamlessly across a wide range of consumer devices.
;Service providers
:HANA enables new market opportunities for service providers. By providing a secure content protection zone for HD content, HANA would allow service providers to take advantage of the retail channel sooner while reducing [[capital expenditure]]s and providing simple and reliable access to AV entertainment for their customers.
;Consumer electronics manufacturers
:CE manufacturers would be able to deliver new and exciting products and features to their consumers, while simultaneously simplifying the [[user experience]]. Just as importantly, a product that rolls out today would not become obsolete every time something new is introduced. New products are required to adhere to the baseline standard guaranteeing interoperability with existing products.
;Information technology
:HANA would enable consumers to move their personal content from the Internet and their PCs to their CE devices around the home. By developing a standards-based [[secure environment]] for the distribution of content, HANA sought to help improve the consumer experience, expand the community of [[network media]] devices and create new market opportunities.

==HAVi==
Eight major consumer electronics manufacturers have come up with an  open standard enabling home entertainment devices to communicate intelligently with each other. The HAVi (Home Audio Video Interoperability)  standard promises to bring true platform independent interoperability to  consumer devices using high bandwidth IEEE 1394 (FireWire) as the connecting medium.

The manufactures, namely [[Grundig]], [[Hitachi]], [[Panasonic]], [[Philips]], [[Sharp_Corporation|Sharp]], [[Sony]], [[Technicolor SA|Thomson]] and [[Toshiba]] along with now over 30 other participants, have formed a non-profit organization called HAVi (Home Audio Video Interoperability) for promoting the development of interoperable consumer products. The goal of HAVi organization is to provide a standard [[open architecture]] for intelligent audio and video devices to interoperate with each other regardless of manufacturer, operating system, CPU or programming language used for implementation (HAVi, Inc., 2001a).

The first beta version of the HAVi standard version 1.0 was published in December 1998 while the final 1.0 version was released in December 1999. The current version of the specification is 1.1 (HAVi, Inc., 2001b) and it was published in May 15, 2001.

==Content protection==
HANA uses content protection developed in conjunction with IBM, a HANA member, called Advanced Secure Content Cluster Technology (ASCCT). ASCCT content protection is based on [[broadcast encryption]] [[key management]] and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] 128 for distribution and storage. ASCCT was designed specifically for home networks. Devices connected on a HANA network are cryptographically bound to each other to create an “authorized domain”, with each domain receiving its own unique ID. All devices that are members of this domain share certain cryptographic secrets allowing them to act in many ways, as if they are a single device. When content is received into the [[authorized domain]], it too is bound in that only authorized members of the domain will have the keys to decrypt it. If a copy were to be given to a non-authorized device, it would not be able to decrypt it, rendering the copy useless. Moreover, devices may only be a member of a single domain and they may only play content that is bound to that domain. This avoids any situation where a device is loaded with content on one network and then moved to another. To share content, it must join the new network at which time its keys from the original domain are destroyed and the content rendered unreadable.

ASCCT, as implemented by HANA, is a [[peer-to-peer]] solution. There is no central device that maintains the decryption keys or the library of content. Therefore, there is no central failure point as there is for many other solutions such as a cable STB PVR or a PC. It is based on broadcast encryption, the same basic technology used in 4C and AACS content protection. Similar to AACS, a compromised device or class of devices is repairable by revocation of device the keys which can occur any time new content is imported into the domain, or a connection is made to a content service. Further, content can be pre-encrypted with ASCCT by provider or delivered using a proprietary content protection which is then can transcrypted to ASSCT using the built-in secure encryption engine in HANA devices.

A benefit of this approach is that it supports managed copies of content distributed by DVD, On-Demand services, downloads from the Internet, etc. Perfect copies of a movie can be stored on any or all devices within the domain without fear the copies will be distributed outside the domain. Portable devices can be disconnected and still play the content, yet if they are connected to another device or network, any copy left behind cannot be used. The decryption keys remain with the authorized device.

==Industry alliances==
HANA worked with several leading organizations to realize its vision of a trusted, easy-to-use home entertainment network that enhanced the consumer HD experience. HANA did not create specifications; instead it worked with existing standards and developing design guidelines to incorporate best in class technologies. HANA worked with organizations such as the 1394 Trade Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1394ta.org/index.html 1394ta.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CableLabs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cablelabs.com/ Cablelabs.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1326">A '''Hook gauge evaporimeter''' is a precision instrument used to measure changes in water levels due to [[evaporation]]. It is used 
to precisely measure the level of a free water surface as an [[Pan evaporation|evaporation pan]] or a tank. The main users are  [[meteorologist]]s and water engineers, especially in hot, arid countries where water conservation is of vital importance.

== Description ==

The device consists of a sharp hook suspended from a [[micrometer]] cylinder, with the body of the device having arms which rest on the rim of a [[still well]] inside the pan. The still well serves to isolate the device from any ripples that might be present in the sample being measured, while allowing the water level to equalize. The measurement is taken by turning the knob to lower the hook through the surface of the water until [[capillary action]] causes a small depression to form around the tip of the hook. The knob is then turned slowly until the depression "pops," with the measurement showing on the micrometer scale.

== Use ==

Evaporation rate is determined by a sequence of measurements over a set time interval, usually every 24 hours.

'''Industrial augmented reality''' ('''IAR''') is related to the application of [[augmented reality]] (AR) to support an industrial process.&lt;ref name=fite2011there&gt;{{cite conference | title = Is there a reality in Industrial Augmented Reality?| last1 = Fite-Georgel| first1 =  Pierre| date = 2011| publisher = IEEE| book-title = Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR), 2011 10th IEEE International Symposium on| pages = 201–210| location = | id =
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of IAR dates back to the 1990s with the work of [[Thomas Caudell]] and [[David Mizell]] about the application of AR at [[Boeing]].&lt;ref name=caudell1992augmented&gt;{{cite conference| last1       = Caudell| first1      = Thomas P| last2       = Mizell| first2     =  David W| date       = 1992| title      = Augmented reality: An application of heads-up display technology to manual manufacturing processes| journal    = Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments| publisher  = IEEE| book-title = System Sciences, 1992. Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Hawaii International Conference on| volume     = 2| pages      = 659–669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then several applications of this technique over the years have been proposed showing its potential in supporting some industrial processes. Although there have been several advances in technology, IAR is still considered to be at an infant developmental stage.&lt;ref name=regenbrecht2005augmented /&gt;&lt;ref name=nee2012augmented&gt;{{ cite journal|  title=Augmented reality applications in design and manufacturing|  author=Nee, AYC and Ong, SK and Chryssolouris, G and Mourtzis, D|  journal=CIRP Annals-Manufacturing Technology|  volume=61|  number=2|  pages=657–679|  year=2012| doi=10.1016/j.cirp.2012.05.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pentenrieder2007augmented&gt;{{cite journal|  title=Augmented Reality-based factory planning-an application tailored to industrial needs|  author=Pentenrieder, Katharina and Bade, Christian and Doil, Fabian and Meier, Peter|  booktitle=Mixed and Augmented Reality, 2007.

Some challenging factors of IAR development are related to the necessary [[interdisciplinarity]] knowledge in areas such as [[object recognition]], [[computer graphics]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[human computer interaction|human-computer-interaction]]. Where a partial context understanding is required for the adaptation to unexpected conditions and understand the user's actions and intentions. Additionally user intuitive interfaces still remain a challenge likewise hardware improvements such as [[sensor]]s and [[display device|displays]].&lt;ref name=nee2012augmented /&gt;&lt;ref name=wang2016comprehensive&gt;{{cite journal|  title=A comprehensive survey of augmented reality assembly research|  author=Wang, X and Ong, SK and Nee, AYC|  journal=Advances in Manufacturing|  volume=4|  number=1|  pages=1–22|  year=2016| doi=10.1007/s40436-015-0131-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lamberti2014challenges&gt;{{cite journal|  title=Challenges, opportunities, and future trends of emerging techniques for augmented reality-based maintenance|  author=Lamberti, Fabrizio and Manuri, Federico and Sanna, Andrea and Paravati, Gianluca and Pezzolla, Pietro and Montuschi, Paolo|  journal=IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing|  volume=2|  number=4|  pages=411–421|  year=2014| doi=10.1109/tetc.2014.2368833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, some controversy prevails about the boundaries that define IAR and its potential benefits for some activities with the currently available technology.&lt;ref name=hincapie2011introduction&gt;{{cite conference|  title=An introduction to Augmented Reality with applications in aeronautical maintenance|  author=Hincapié, Mauricio and Caponio, Andrea and Rios, Horacio and Mendívil, Eduardo González|  booktitle=2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks|  pages=1–4|  year=2011|  publisher=IEEE	}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

===Origins and history===
Although the origins of [[Augmented Reality]] dates from the 1960s, when [[Ivan Sutherland]] created  the first [[head-mounted display ]]&lt;ref name=sutherland1968head&gt;{{cite conference |  title=A head-mounted three dimensional display|  author=Sutherland, Ivan E|  booktitle=Proceedings of the December 9–11, 1968, fall joint computer conference, part I|  pages=757–764|  year=1968|  publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt; it did not gain strength until the early 1990s, when the [[David Mizell]] and [[Thomas Caudell]]  developed the first industrial [[augmented reality|AR]] at [[Boeing]]. They used a [[head-mounted display]] ('''HMD''') to superimpose a computer-generated diagram of the manufacturing process with a real-time world [[Image registration|registration]] and the user's head position calculation. They coined the name [[Augmented Reality]] to this technology.&lt;ref name=caudell1992augmented /&gt;&lt;ref name=navab2004developing&gt;{{cite journal| last       = Navab| first      = Nassir| journal=Computer Graphics and Applications, IEEE| title=Developing killer apps for industrial augmented reality|  volume=24|  number=3| pages=16–20|  year=2004| doi=10.1109/mcg.2004.1297006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Contemporary several prototypes were proposed to demonstrate AR's application to manufacturing:&lt;ref name=azuma1997survey /&gt; a laser-printer maintenance application was proposed in 1993 by [[Steven K. Feiner]] and coauthors by introducing the concept of knowledge-based AR for maintenance assistance (KARMA).&lt;ref name=feiner1992annotating&gt;{{cite conference  | title= Annotating the real world with knowledge-based graphics on a see-through head-mounted display  | author=Feiner, Steven and MacIntyre, Blair and Seligmann, Dorée  | booktitle=Proceedings of the conference on Graphics interface'92  | pages=78–85 | year=1992 | publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=feiner1993knowledge&gt;{{cite news|  title=Knowledge-based augmented reality|  author=Feiner, Steven and Macintyre, Blair and Seligmann, Dor{\'e}e|  journal=Communications of the ACM|  volume=36|  number=7|  pages=53–62|  year=1993|  publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whitaker Ross]] et al. proposed a system to display the name of the part pointed by the user in an engine.&lt;ref name=whitaker1995object&gt;{{cite conference|  title=Object calibration for augmented reality|  author=Whitaker, Ross T and Crampton, Chris and Breen, David E and Tuceryan, Mihran and Rose, Eric|  booktitle=Computer Graphics Forum|  volume=14|  number=3|  pages=15–27|  year=1995|  publisher=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 2000s, the interest in AR had grown considerably. Some important groups were funded:&lt;ref name=navab2004developing /&gt; the largest consortium for IAR backed by the German's Federal Ministry of Education and Research (ARVIKA), with the aim of researching and implementing AR in relevant German industries,;&lt;ref name=wohlgemuth2000arvika&gt;{{ cite conference|  title=ARVIKA: augmented reality for development, production and service|author1=Wohlgemuth, Wolfgang  |author2=Triebfurst, Gunthard|  booktitle=Proceedings of DARE 2000 on Designing augmented reality environments|  pages=151–152|  year=2000|  publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt; the European Community founded several projects including Service and Training through (STAR), which is a collaboration between institutes and companies from Europe and the US,&lt;ref name=raczynski2004services&gt;{{ cite conference|  title=Services and training through augmented reality|author1=Raczynski, A  |author2=Gussmann, P|  booktitle=Visual Media Production, 2004.(CVMP). 1st European Conference on|  pages=263–271|  year=2004|  publisher=IET}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Advanced Augmented Reality Technologies for Industrial Service Applications (ARTESAS) derived from ARVIKA, focused on the development of AR for automotive and aerospace maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.wzl.rwth-aachen.de/en/aa272c5cc77694f6c12570fb00676ba1.htm| title =Project ARTESAS - Advanced Augmented Reality Technologies for Industrial Service Applications| publisher = WZL| access-date = 2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, from other countries such as Sweden, Australia and Japan with the aim of encourage the IAR development.

From the beginning of 2010 until today, advances in hardware devices such as the wearable [[Google Glass]], the reduced cost of [[mobile device]]s, and the increasing user familiarity with this technology.&lt;ref name=lamberti2014challenges /&gt; Besides the increasing product-development complexity where products are becoming more versatile and intricate, with multiple variations and mass customization. Opened new scenarios for this technology.&lt;ref name=ong2008augmented&gt;{{cite journal|  title=Augmented reality applications in manufacturing: a survey|  author=Ong, SK and Yuan, ML and Nee, AYC|  journal=International Journal of Production Research|  volume=46|  number=10|  pages=2707–2742|  year=2008| doi=10.1080/00207540601064773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
[[File:Duplex-ball-valves-The-Alloy-Valve-Stockist-side.JPG|thumb|Industrial part visual characteristics duplex ball valves]]
One of the most promising fields of AR application is industrial manufacturing, where it can be used to support some activities in  product development and manufacturing&lt;ref name=shoaib24survey&gt;{{cite journal|  title=A Survey of Augmented Reality|author1=Shoaib, Huma  |author2=Jaffry, S Waqar|  journal=Interactions|  volume=24|  pages=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through providing information available to reduce and simplify  the user's decisions.&lt;ref name=gaukrodger2007augmented&gt;{{cite conference|  title=Augmented reality and applications for assistive technology|author1=Gaukrodger, Stephen J  |author2=Lintott, Andrew|  booktitle=Proceedings of the 1st international convention on Rehabilitation engineering &amp;assistive technology: in conjunction with 1st Tan Tock Seng Hospital Neurorehabilitation Meeting|  pages=47–51|  year=2007|  publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general issues of the development of an AR system can still be classified into:&lt;ref name=azuma2001recent&gt;{{ cite journal|  title=Recent advances in augmented reality|  author=Azuma, Ronald and Baillot, Yohan and Behringer, Reinhold and Feiner, Steven and Julier, Simon and MacIntyre, Blair|  journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|  volume=21|  number=6|  pages=34–47|  year=2001| doi=10.1109/38.963459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enabling technology====
[[File:MannGlas and GoogleGlass1 crop.jpg|thumb|MannGlas and GoogleGlass1]]
There are technologies needed to build AR systems. Some of them are directly related with the performance of the [[software]] and [[Computer hardware|hardware]] that enable the deployment of AR, such as displays, sensors, [[central processor|processors]], [[object recognition|recognition]], [[Augmented reality#Tracking|tracking]], [[image registration|registration]] among others.&lt;ref name=azuma2001recent /&gt; Thus AR uses different approaches to integrate the virtual and real worlds, where several technologies influence the usability and applicability.&lt;ref name=chi2013research&gt;{{cite journal|  title=Research trends and opportunities of augmented reality applications in architecture, engineering, and construction|  author=Chi, Hung-Lin and Kang, Shih-Chung and Wang, Xiangyu|  journal=Automation in Construction|  volume=33|  pages=116–122|  year=2013| doi=10.1016/j.autcon.2012.12.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common unsolved issues concern tracking systems suited for industrial scenarios which mean: poorly textured objects with smooth surfaces and strong light variation; object recognition using natural features when it is not possible to use [[Fiducial marker|markers]];&lt;ref name=lamberti2014challenges /&gt; the improvement of [[accuracy]] and [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] of  registration,&lt;ref name=nee2012augmented /&gt; and [[3D scanner|3D context scene capture]] to allow [[context awareness]].&lt;ref name=wang2016comprehensive /&gt;

====User interaction====
The limited understanding of human factors is likely to be obstructing the spreading of IAR  beyond laboratories prototypes.&lt;ref name=nee2012augmented /&gt; Their study is challenged to overcome technological issues (deficiencies in resolution, field of view, brightness, contrast, tracking systems, among others) in order to separate the AR performance from interface factors and technological issues.&lt;ref name=livingston2005evaluating&gt;{{cite journal|  title=Evaluating human factors in augmented reality systems|  author=Livingston, Mark A|  journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|  volume=25|  number=6|  pages=6–9|  year=2005| doi=10.1109/mcg.2005.130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was suggested by&lt;ref name=navab2004developing /&gt; that for an IAR application to be successful in a commercial environment, it has to be [[usability|"user friendly"]], meaning that it needs to be easy and safe to setup, learn, use and customize and the user should feel free to move with an AR system.&lt;ref name=hincapie2011introduction /&gt; As well as the use of [[Natural user interface|natural interfaces]] in order to control AR by using natural movements of the body have also motivated a good deal of research. The reason for this is that the usability not only depends on the system's stability but also on the control interface's quality.&lt;ref name=chi2013research /&gt;

Further, the user interface should avoid overloading the user with information and prevent over relying on it in order to avoid losing important cues from the environment.&lt;ref name=van2010survey&gt;{{cite journal|  title=A survey of augmented reality technologies, applications and limitations|author1=Van Krevelen, DWF  |author2=Poelman, R|  journal=International Journal of Virtual Reality|  volume=9|  number=2|  pages=1|  year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues are also related with improving multiple user collaboration&lt;ref name=wang2016comprehensive /&gt;

====Social==== 
It is the final challenge, given an ideal AR system (hardware, software and an intuitive interface) to be accepted and become a part of a user's daily life.&lt;ref name=azuma2001recent /&gt;
 
Consequently, one of the most important factors related with the adoption of any new technology is the perception of usefulness, and AR needs to show a clear cost-benefit relation.&lt;ref name=davis1989perceived&gt;{{cite journal|  title=Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology|  author=Davis, Fred D|  journal=MIS Quarterly|  pages=319–340|  year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies suggest that, in order for AR to be perceived as useful the task should be high enough to require its use.&lt;ref name=syberfeldt2015visual&gt;{{cite journal|  title=Visual assembling guidance using augmented reality|  author=Syberfeldt, Anna and Danielsson, Oscar and Holm, Magnus and Wang, Lihui|  journal=Procedia Manufacturing|  volume=1|  pages=98–109|  year=2015| doi=10.1016/j.promfg.2015.09.068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other non-addressed but important issues for technology acceptance are related with fashion, ethics, and privacy.&lt;ref name=azuma2001recent /&gt;

==Applications==

===Assembly===
Assembling is the process of putting together several separate components in order to create a functional one. It can be performed in different stages of the product's life.&lt;ref name=whitney2004mechanical&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitney|first1=D.E|title=Mechanical Assemblies: Their Design, Manufacture, and Role in Product Development|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195157826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though nowadays many assembly operations are automated, some of them still require human assistance as, in many cases, their bits of information are detached from the equipment. Thus it is necessary to alternate their attention which leads to decreasing productivity and increasing of errors and injuries&lt;ref name=ong2008augmented /&gt;

The use of [[augmented reality|AR]] is encouraged by the premise that instructions might be easier to understand if instead of being available as manuals they are super imposed upon the actual equipment.&lt;ref name=azuma1997survey&gt;{{cite journal| last       = Ronald T| first      = Azuma| date       = 1997| title      = A survey of augmented reality| journal    = Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments| volume     = 6| pages      = 355–385| number 	= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the uses of AR in the support of the assembly can be categorized into:&lt;ref name=wang2016comprehensive /&gt;
*Assembly guidance
*Assembly training
*Assembly simulation, design and planning

Similarly, by using AR it is possible to simulate the user's motion during assembly to acquire an accurate and realistic movement of virtual parts.&lt;ref name=wang2016real&gt;{{ cite journal|  title=Real-virtual components interaction for assembly simulation and planning| author=Wang, X and Ong, SK and Nee, AYC|  journal=Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing|  volume=41|  pages=102–114|  year=2016| doi=10.1016/j.rcim.2016.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some of the critical issues of the support assembly task are related with the dynamic reconfiguration of the state diagram, which allows to automatically identify the step of assembly and also adapt to unexpected actions or errors of the user.&lt;ref name=wang2016comprehensive /&gt;&lt;ref name=lamberti2014challenges /&gt; Thus, defining 'what', 'where', and 'when' to display information becomes a challenge since it requires a minimum understanding of the surrounding scene.&lt;ref name=yuan2008augmented&gt;{{cite journal|  title=Augmented reality for assembly guidance using a virtual interactive tool|  author=Yuan, ML and Ong, SK and Nee, AY|  journal=International Journal of Production Research|  volume=46|  number=7|  pages=1745–1767|  year=2008| doi=10.1080/00207540600972935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance and repair===
Like the assembly task, maintenance serves as a natural application for AR  because it is a tasks that requires keeping the user's attention on a specific area, and also synthesizing additional information such as complex sequences, component identification, and textual data.&lt;ref name=henderson2007augmented&gt;{{cite techreport| title=Augmented reality for maintenance and repair (armar)|author1=Henderson, Steven J  |author2=Feiner, Steven K|  year=2007|  institution=DTIC Document}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The maintenance activity can be supported by displaying related information about an unfamiliar piece of equipment to a technician instead of searching it in a repair manual.&lt;ref name=schwald2003augmented&gt;{{cite journal|  title=An augmented reality system for training and assistance to maintenance in the industrial context|author1=Schwald, Bernd  |author2=De Laval, Blandine|  year=2003|  publisher=UNION Agency--Science Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, AR can support maintenance tasks by acting as an "x-ray" like vision, or providing information from sensors directly to the user.&lt;ref name=van2010survey /&gt;

It can also be employed in repairing tasks. For instance, in the diagnosis of modern cars whose status information can be loaded via a plug-like connector. AR can be used to immediately display the diagnosis on the engine&lt;ref name=regenbrecht2005augmented&gt;{{cite journal|  title=Augmented reality projects in the automotive and aerospace industries|  author=Regenbrecht, Holger and Baratoff, Gregory and Wilke, Wilhelm|  journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|  volume=25|  number=6|  pages=48–56|  year=2005| doi=10.1109/mcg.2005.124|  pmid=16315477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training===
Many industries are required to perform complex activities that needs previous training. Therefore, for learning a new skill, technicians need to be trained in sensorimotive and cognitive of sub-skills that can be challenging. This kind of training can be supported by AR.&lt;ref name=webel2013augmented&gt;{{cite journal|  title=An augmented reality training platform for assembly and maintenance skills|  author=Webel, Sabine and Bockholt, Uli and Engelke, Timo and Gavish, Nirit and Olbrich, Manuel and Preusche, Carsten|  journal=Robotics and Autonomous Systems|  volume=61|  number=4|  pages=398–403|  year=2013| doi=10.1016/j.robot.2012.09.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the possibility to use AR to motivate both trainees and students through enhancing the realism of practices has been suggested.&lt;ref name=chang2010applications&gt;{{cite conference|  title=Applications of augmented reality systems in education|  author=Chang, George and Morreale, Patricia and Medicherla, Padmavathi|  booktitle=Proceedings of Society for Information Technology &amp; Teacher Education International Conference|  volume=1|  pages=1380–1385|  year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By providing instructions with an AR, the immediate capability to perform the task can be also accomplished.&lt;ref name=chimienti2010guidelines&gt;{{cite conference|  title=Guidelines for implementing augmented reality procedures in assisting assembly operations|  author=Chimienti, Viviana and Iliano, Salvatore and Dassisti, Michele and Dini, Gino and Failli, Franco|  booktitle=International Precision Assembly Seminar| pages=174–179|  year=2010|  publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other advantages of using AR for training are that students can interact with real objects and, at the same time, have access to guidance information,and the existence of tactile feedback provided by the interaction with real objects.&lt;ref name=webel2013augmented /&gt;

===Quality control and commissioning===
By displaying information about the components of manufacturing in real time. For instance, [[Volkswagen]] has used it to verify parts by analyzing their interfering edges and variance. AR has also been used in automobile development to display and verify car components and ergonomic test in reality. By superimposing the original [[3D modeling|3D model]] over the real surface, deviations can easily be identified, and therefore sources of error can be corrected.&lt;ref name=frund2004using&gt;{{cite conference|  title=Using augmented reality technology to support the automobile development|  author=Frund, Jurgen and Gausemeier, Jurgen and Matysczok, Carsten and Radkowski, Rafael|  booktitle=International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design|  pages=289–298|  year=2004|  publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nolle2006augmented&gt;{{cite conference|  title=Augmented reality as a comparison tool in automotive industry|author1=Nolle, Stefan  |author2=[[Gudrun J. Klinker|Klinker, Gudrun]]|  booktitle=Proceedings of the 5th IEEE and ACM International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality|  pages=249–250|  year=2006|  publisher=IEEE Computer Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monitoring and visualization===
The use of AR have been proposed to interact with scientific data in shared environments, where it allows a [[3D interaction]] with real objects compared to [[virtual reality]], while allowing the user to move freely in the real world.&lt;ref name=szalavari1998studierstube&gt;{{cite journal|  title="Studierstube": An environment for collaboration in augmented reality|  author=Szalavári, Zsolt and Schmalstieg, Dieter and Fuhrmann, Anton and Gervautz, Michael|  journal=Virtual Reality|  volume=3|  number=1|  pages=37–48|  year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar systems for allowing multiple user's with HMD can interact with dynamic visual simulations of engineering processes&lt;ref name=dong2013collaborative&gt;{{cite journal|  title=Collaborative visualization of engineering processes using tabletop augmented reality|  author=Dong, Suyang and Behzadan, Amir H and Chen, Feng and Kamat, Vineet R|  journal=Advances in Engineering Software|  volume=55|  pages=45–55|  year=2013| doi=10.1016/j.advengsoft.2012.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, AR simulation of working machinery can be checked from mobile devices as well as other information such as temperature and, time of use, which can reduce worker's movements and stress.&lt;ref name=shoaib24survey /&gt;

==Controversy==
The benefits of implementing AR into some industrial activities have been of a high interest. However, there is still a debate as the current level of the technology hides  all of its potential.&lt;ref name=nee2012augmented /&gt;&lt;ref name=hincapie2011introduction /&gt;

It has been reported that, in maintenance and repair, the use of AR can reduce time to locate a task, head and neck movements, and also other disadvantages related to bulky, low resolution display hardware&lt;ref name=henderson2011exploring&gt;{{cite journal|  title=Exploring the benefits of augmented reality documentation for maintenance and repair|author1=Henderson, Steven  |author2=Feiner, Steven|  journal=IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics|  volume=17|  number=10|  pages=1355–1368|  year=2011| doi=10.1109/tvcg.2010.245|pmid=21041888  |citeseerx=10.1.1.225.8619  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, in training it aims to improve the performance up to 30% and, at the same time reduce costs by 25%.&lt;ref name=smartMaintenance&gt;{{cite web | url = http://arblog.inglobetechnologies.com/?p=1370 | title = Smart Maintenance An Augmented Reality Platform for Training and Field Operations in the Manufacturing Industry  | date = 2014 | publisher =AR BLOG| access-date =2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar benefits have been reported by [[Juha Sääski]] et al. in the comparative use of AR versus paper instructions to support the assembly operation of the parts of a tractor's accessory power unit which showed a time and error reduction (six time less).&lt;ref name=saaski2008augmented&gt;{{cite conference|  title=Augmented reality efficiency in manufacturing industry: a case study |author=Saaski, Juha |author2=Salonen, Tapio |author3=Liinasuo, Marja |author4=Pakkanen, Jarkko |author5=Vanhatalo, Mikko |author6=Riitahuhta, Asko |  booktitle=DS 50: Proceedings of NordDesign 2008 Conference, Tallinn, Estonia, 21.-23.08. 2008|  year=2008 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, on the other hand, the long-term use has been reported to cause stress and strain to the user. [[Johannes Tumler]] et al. compared the stress and strain produced by picking parts from a rack using AR versus using paper as a reference, which showed as result a change of the strain that could be assumed by the non-optimal system.&lt;ref name=tumler2008mobile&gt;{{cite conference|  title=Mobile Augmented Reality in industrial applications: Approaches for solution of user-related issues |author=Tumler, Johannes |author2=Doil, Fabian |author3=Mecke, Rudiger |author4=Paul, Georg |author5=Schenk, Michael |author6=Pfister, Eberhard A |author7=Huckauf, Anke |author8=Bockelmann, Irina |author9=Roggentin, Anja |booktitle=Proceedings of the 7th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality|  pages=87–90|  year=2008|  publisher=IEEE Computer Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it has been suggested &lt;ref name=webel2013augmented /&gt; that one potential danger in use AR for training is the user dependability of this technology. As a consequence the user will not be able to perform the task without it. In order to overcome this situation, the information available during training needs to be controlled.

The boundaries that define IAR are still not clear. For instance, one of the most accepted definitions&lt;ref name=azuma1997survey /&gt; of AR implies that the virtual elements need to be registered. But in industrial field, performance is a main goal, and therefore has been an extensive research about the presentation of virtual components in AR regarding the type of the task. This research has shown that the optimal visual aid type may variate depending on the difficulty of the task.&lt;ref name=radkowski2015investigation&gt;{{cite conference|  title=Investigation of Visual Features for Augmented Reality Assembly Assistance|  author=Radkowski, Rafael|  booktitle=International Conference on Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality|  pages=488–498|  year=2015|  publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, it has been suggested&lt;ref name=navab2004developing /&gt; that in order to have commercial IAR solutions, they must be:
* Robust and reproducible with accuracy.
* [[usability|User friendly]].
* Scalable beyond simple prototypes.

In digital logic, an '''inverter''' or '''NOT gate''' is a [[logic gate]] which implements [[logical negation]]. The [[truth table]] is shown on the right.

==Electronic implementation==
An inverter circuit outputs a voltage representing the opposite logic-level to its input. Its main function is to invert the input signal applied. If the applied input is low then the output becomes high and vice versa. Inverters can be constructed using a single [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] transistor or a single [[PMOS logic|PMOS]] transistor coupled with a [[resistor]].  Since this 'resistive-drain' approach uses only a single type of transistor, it can be fabricated at low cost.  However, because current flows through the resistor in one of the two states, the resistive-drain configuration is disadvantaged for power consumption and processing speed.  Alternatively, inverters can be constructed using two complementary transistors in a [[CMOS]] configuration.  This configuration greatly reduces power consumption since one of the transistors is always off in both logic states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nair |first1=B. Somanathan |title=Digital electronics and logic design |date=2002 |publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd. |isbn=9788120319561 |page=240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WK45wLHL-ycC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Processing speed can also be improved due to the relatively low resistance compared to the NMOS-only or PMOS-only type devices.  Inverters can also be constructed with [[bipolar junction transistor]]s (BJT) in either a  [[resistor–transistor logic]] (RTL) or a [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL) configuration.

[[Digital data|Digital]] electronics circuits operate at fixed voltage levels corresponding to a logical 0 or 1 (see [[Binary numeral system|binary]]).  An inverter circuit serves as the basic logic gate to swap between those two voltage levels.  Implementation determines the actual voltage, but common levels include (0, +5V) for TTL circuits.

===Digital building block===
[[File:CMOS 4049 diagram.svg|thumb|right|150px|This schematic diagram shows the arrangement of NOT gates within a standard 4049 CMOS hex inverting buffer.]]
The inverter is a basic building block in digital electronics.  Multiplexers, decoders, state machines, and other sophisticated digital devices may use inverters.

The ''hex inverter'' is an [[integrated circuit]] that contains six (''[[wikt:hexa-|hexa-]]'') inverters. For example, the [[7400 series|7404]] [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]] chip which has 14 pins and the 4049 [[CMOS]] chip which has 16 pins, 2 of which are used for power/referencing, and 12 of which are used by the inputs and outputs of the six inverters (the 4049 has 2 pins with no connection).

==== Analytical representation ====
&lt;math&gt;f(a)=1-a&lt;/math&gt; is the analytical representation of NOT gate:
* &lt;math&gt;f(0)=1-0=1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(1)=1-1=0&lt;/math&gt;

=== Alternatives ===
{{further|NAND logic|NOR logic}}
If no specific NOT gates are available, one can be made from the universal [[NAND Gate|NAND]] or [[NOR Gate|NOR]] gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=M. Morris |first1=Mano |last2=R. Kime |first2=Charles |title=Logic and computer design fundamentals |date=2004 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0133760634 |page=73 |edition=3 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=jPEWogEACAAJ&amp;dq=Logic+and+Computer+Design+Fundamentals&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ_rbarr_eAhXJBsAKHRbeAWwQ6AEILDAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance measurement===
[[File:Inverter voltage transfer curve.png|thumb|300px|Voltage transfer curve for a 20 μm inverter constructed at [[North Carolina State University]] ]]

Digital inverter quality is often measured using the voltage transfer curve (VTC), which is a plot of output vs. input voltage. From such a graph, device parameters including noise tolerance, gain, and operating logic levels can be obtained.

Ideally, the VTC appears as an inverted step function – this would indicate precise switching between ''on'' and ''off'' – but in real devices, a gradual transition region exists. The VTC indicates that for low input voltage, the circuit outputs high voltage; for high input, the output tapers off towards the low level. The slope of this transition region is a measure of quality – steep (close to infinity) slopes yield precise switching.

The tolerance to noise can be measured by comparing the minimum input to the maximum output for each region of operation (on / off).

'''Jupiter Cantab Limited''' was a [[Cambridge]] based [[home computer]] company. Its main product was the 1983 [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] based [[Jupiter Ace]].

The company was founded in 1982 by two ex-[[Sinclair Research]] staffers, [[Richard Altwasser]] and [[Steve Vickers (academia)|Steven Vickers]]. Their machine was, externally, remarkably similar to the [[ZX Spectrum]], with a copycat rubber keyboard. It also used the same [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor. The Ace's video output was limited to monochrome like the [[ZX-81]].

The £90 Ace was a flop in both the UK and US markets: the Forth language, although considered powerful, was not as popular or accessible as the already well-established BASIC language featured in competing microcomputers. In the US it was sold as the ''Ace 4000''.

The company went bankrupt in November 1983 and its assets were sold to [[Boldfield Computing|Boldfield Computing Ltd]] in 1984. The remaining hardware was sold-off into 1985. Boldfield Computing Ltd also commissioned some software for it, including various games, database, and spread sheet software. Documentation to this exists and is held by the current owners of the brand.

The sale of Boldfield’s IT solution business in 2006, excluded the rights to the Jupiter Ace IP and brand, but this was later sold to [[Paul Andrews (producer)|Andrews UK Limited]] in 2015.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

'''Looker Data Sciences''' (doing business as '''Looker''') is an American [[computer software]] company headquartered in [[Santa Cruz, California]].  Looker markets a [[data exploration]] and discovery [[business intelligence]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looker.com/ |title=Looker |publisher=Looker |date= |accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The company was founded in Santa Cruz, California in January, 2012 by Lloyd Tabb and Ben Porterfield. The product grew out of Tabb's experience building software at companies like [[Netscape]], [[LiveOps]], and Luminate before founding Looker.

Looker makes use of a simple modeling language called LookML that lets data teams define the relationships in their database so business users can explore, save, and download data without needing to know the [[SQL]] query language.
The product was the first commercially available [[business intelligence]] platform built for and aimed at scalable or [[Massively parallel (computing)|massively parallel]] [[relational database management systems]] like [[Amazon Redshift]], Google [[BigQuery]], HP [[Vertica]], [[Netezza]], and [[Teradata]].

On August 13, 2013, Looker announced a Series A round of funding from [[Redpoint Ventures]], First Round Capital, and PivotNorth Capital, raising more than $18M.&lt;ref name="looker_series_a"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pando.com/2013/08/13/looker-announces-16m-series-a-and-a-savvy-new-ceo-rise-above-stodgy-old-bi-solutions/ |title=Looker announces a $16M Series A and a savvy new CEO to rise above stodgy old BI solutions |author=Carney, Michael |date=August 13, 2013 |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |publisher=PandoDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Series A round, Looker raised $2M in a seed round from [[First Round Capital]] and [[PivotNorth Capital]].&lt;ref name="looker_series_a"/&gt; On March 11, 2015 Looker raised $30M in series B funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/03/11/looker-raises-30m-to-further-its-analytics-aims/ |title= Looker Raises $30M To Further Its Analytics Aims |author= Ben Kepes |work= Forbes |date= March 11, 2015 |access-date= August 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July, 2015, Jen Grant joined as chief marketing officer, and the company estimated it has 140 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Fast-growing data analytics company Looker hires former Box exec Jen Grant |author= Dylan Tweney |date= July 1, 2015 |work= Venture Beat |access-date = August 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 14, 2016 Looker raised $48M in series C funding from [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers|Kleiner Perkins Claufield &amp; Byers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title =  Looker Series C Funding from Kleiner Perkins |work= Press release |publisher= Looker Data Sciences|url = http://www.looker.com/news/press/looker-secures-48-million-series-c-funding-from-kleiner-perkins |date= January 14, 2016  |access-date = August 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the company estimated 450 customers, including [[Jet.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Data analytics startup Looker raises $48 million, led by Kleiner Perkins |work= Venture Beat |author= Jordan Novet |date= January 14, 2016  |access-date = August 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 30th, 2017 Looker raised $81.5M in series D funding led by Capital G.

Margaret's interest in photography began as a young woman's hobby, supported by her father's enthusiasm for cameras.&lt;ref name="USATodayProfile"/&gt; Despite her interest, in 1922, she began studying [[herpetology]] at [[Columbia University]], only to have her interest in [[photography]] strengthened after studying under [[Clarence Hudson White|Clarence White]] (no relation).&lt;ref name="USATodayProfile"/&gt; She left after one semester, following the death of her father.&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt; She transferred colleges several times, attending  the [[University of Michigan]] (where she became a member of [[Alpha Omicron Pi]] sorority),&lt;ref name="ECU-Greek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecu.edu/cs-studentaffairs/greeklife/npc/alphaomicronpi.cfm |title=Greek Life NPC Alpha Omicron Pi |work=Student Affairs |publisher=[[East Carolina University]] |accessdate= 2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Purdue University]] in [[Indiana]], and [[Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt; Bourke-White ultimately graduated from [[Cornell University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1927, leaving behind a photographic study of the rural campus for the school's newspaper, including photographs of her famed dormitory, [[Risley Residential College|Risley Hall]].&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USATodayProfile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EarlyWorkGoogleBook"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Bourke-White  | first = Margaret  |author2=Ronald Elroy Ostman |author3=Harry Littell  | title = Margaret Bourke-White: the early work, 1922-1930 | publisher =  David R.

In 1924, during her studies, she married Everett Chapman, but the couple divorced two years later.&lt;ref name="gallerym.com"/&gt; Margaret White added her mother's surname, "Bourke" to her name in 1927 and hyphenated it.&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt;

==Architectural and commercial photography==

One of Bourke-White's clients was Otis Steel Company. Her success was due to her skills with both people and her technique. Her experience at Otis is a good example. As she explains in ''Portrait of Myself'', the Otis security people were reluctant to let her shoot for many reasons.

Firstly, steel making was a defense industry, so they wanted to be sure national security was not endangered. Second, she was a woman, and in those days, people wondered if a woman and her delicate cameras could stand up to the intense heat, hazard, and generally dirty and gritty conditions inside a [[steel]] mill. When she finally got permission, technical problems began.

[[Black-and-white film]] in that era was sensitive to blue light, not the reds and oranges of hot steel, so she could see the beauty, but the photographs were coming out all black. She solved this problem by bringing along a new style of [[magnesium]] [[flare]], which produces white light, and having assistants hold them to light her scenes. Her abilities resulted in some of the best steel factory photographs of that era, which earned her national attention.
"To me... industrial forms were all the more beautiful because they were never designed to be beautiful.  They had a simplicity of line that came from their direct application of purpose. Industry... had evolved an unconscious beauty - often a hidden beauty that was waiting to be discovered" Margaret Burke-White, Portrait of Myself (New York: Simon and Shuster, 1963), 49.

==Photojournalism==
[[File:Kentucky Flood by Margaret Bourke-White.jpg|thumb|right|"[[Ohio River flood of 1937#Kentucky|Kentucky Flood]]", February 1937]]
In 1929, Bourke-White accepted a job as associate editor and staff photographer of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine, a position she held until 1935.&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt; In 1930, she became the first Western photographer allowed to take photographs of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] industry.&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt;

She was hired by [[Henry Luce]] as the first female photojournalist for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in 1936.&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt; She held the title of staff photographer until 1940, but returned from 1941 to 1942,&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt; and again in 1945, after which she stayed through her semi-retirement in 1957 (which ended her photography for the magazine)&lt;ref name="scout productions.com" /&gt; and her full retirement in 1969.&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt;

Her photographs of the construction of the [[Fort Peck Dam]] were featured in ''Life'''s first issue, dated November 23, 1936, including the cover.&lt;ref&gt;[https://images.google.com/images?q=1930s+source:life+fort+peck+dam+margaret+bourke+white 1930s source:life fort peck dam margaret bourke white - Google Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This cover photograph became such a favorite (see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usace.army.mil/History/PublishingImages/Vignettes/066/life_mag_cover_ftpeck.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506053946/http://www.usace.army.mil/History/PublishingImages/Vignettes/066/life_mag_cover_ftpeck.jpg |archivedate=2010-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) that it was the 1930s' representative in the [[United States Postal Service]]'s ''Celebrate the Century'' series of commemorative [[postage stamp]]s. "Although Bourke-White titled the photo, ''New Deal, Montana: Fort Peck Dam'', it is actually a photo of the spillway located three miles east of the dam," according to a [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] web page.&lt;ref name="USACE"&gt;[http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/history/vignettes/Vignette_66.htm] Web page for [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] Office of History. Retrieved July 2, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050409125928/http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/history/vignettes/Vignette_66.htm |date=April 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-1930s, Bourke-White, like [[Dorothea Lange]], photographed drought victims of the [[Dust Bowl]]. In the February 15, 1937 issue of ''Life'' magazine, her famous photograph of black flood victims standing in front of a sign which declared, "World's Highest Standard of Living", showing a white family, was published. The photograph later would become the basis for the artwork of [[Curtis Mayfield]]'s 1975 album, ''[[There's No Place Like America Today]]''.

Bourke-White and [[novelist]] [[Erskine Caldwell]] were married from 1939 to their divorce in 1942,&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt; and collaborated on ''[[You Have Seen Their Faces]]'' (1937), a book about conditions in the South during the Great Depression.

&lt;!--In 1940, she was appointed Chief Photographer for ''PM Magazine''.&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt;
--&gt;
She also traveled to [[Europe]] to record how [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Czechoslovakia]] were faring under Nazism and how Russia was faring under [[Communism]]. While in [[Russia]], she photographed a rare occurrence, [[Joseph Stalin]] with a smile, as well as portraits of Stalin's mother and great-aunt when visiting [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

==World War II==
Bourke-White was the first female [[war correspondent]]&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt; and the first woman to be allowed to work in combat zones during [[World War II]]. In 1941, she traveled to the [[Soviet Union]] just as [[Germany]] broke its pact of non-aggression. She was the only foreign photographer in [[Moscow]] when German forces invaded. Taking refuge in the [[U.S. Embassy in Moscow|U.S. Embassy]], she then captured the ensuing firestorms on camera.

As the war progressed, she was attached to the [[U.S. Army Air Force]] in [[North Africa]], then to the U.S. Army in [[Italy]] and later in Germany. She repeatedly came under fire in Italy in areas of fierce fighting.

"The woman who had been torpedoed in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], strafed by the [[Luftwaffe]], stranded on an [[Arctic]] island, bombarded in Moscow, and pulled out of the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] when her chopper crashed, was known to the ''Life'' staff as 'Maggie the Indestructible.'"&lt;ref name="scout productions.com" /&gt; This incident in the Mediterranean refers to the sinking of the England-Africa bound British troopship ''SS Strathallan'' that she recorded in an article, "Women in Lifeboats", in ''Life'', February 22, 1943. She was disliked by [[General]] [[Dwight D Eisenhower]] but was friendly with his chauffeur/secretary, Irishwoman [[Kay Summersby]], with whom she shared the lifeboat.

In the spring of 1945, she traveled throughout a collapsing Germany with [[general|Gen.]] [[George S. Patton]]. She arrived at [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], the notorious [[concentration camp]], and later said, "Using a camera was almost a relief. It interposed a slight barrier between myself and the horror in front of me." After the war, she produced a book entitled ''Dear Fatherland, Rest Quietly'', a project that helped her come to grips with the brutality she had witnessed during and after the war.

"To many who got in the way of a Bourke-White photograph—and that included not just bureaucrats and functionaries but professional colleagues like assistants, reporters, and other photographers—she was regarded as imperious, calculating, and insensitive."&lt;ref name="scout productions.com" /&gt;

==Recording the India–Pakistan partition violence==

[[File:Gandhi spinning wheel.jpeg|thumb|An iconic photograph that Margaret Bourke-White took of [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] in 1946]]
Bourke-White is known equally well in both [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] for her photographs of [[Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar]] at his home Rajgriha, Dadar in Mumbai on the occasion of a third impression of his book which was published in December 1940 as ''[[Thoughts on Pakistan]]'' (the book was republished in 1946 under the title ''[[India's Political What's What: Pakistan or Partition of India]]''). These photographs were published on LIFE magazine cover. She also photographed [[M. K. Gandhi]] at his spinning wheel and Pakistan's founder, [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]], upright in a chair.&lt;ref name="Sengupta"&gt;Sengupta, Somini, "Bearing Steady Witness To Partition's Wounds," an article in the Arts section, ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 21, 2006, pages E1, E7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Witness to Life and Freedom : Margaret Bourke-white In India &amp; Pakistan|last=Kapoor|first=Pramod|publisher=Lustre Press, Roli Books|year=2010|isbn=978-81-7436-699-3|location=New Delhi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also was "one of the most effective chroniclers" of the violence that erupted at the independence and [[partition of India]] and Pakistan, according to [[Somini Sengupta]], who calls her photographs of the episode "gut-wrenching, and staring at them, you glimpse the photographer's undaunted desire to stare down horror." She recorded streets littered with corpses, dead victims with open eyes, and refugees with vacant eyes. "Bourke-White's photographs seem to scream on the page," Sengupta wrote. The photographs were taken just two years after those Bourke-White took of the newly captured [[Buchenwald]].&lt;ref name="Sengupta"/&gt;

Sixty-six of Bourke-White's photographs of the partition violence were included in a 2006 reissue of [[Khushwant Singh]]'s 1956 novel about the disruption, ''[[Train to Pakistan]]''. In connection with the reissue, many of the photographs in the book were displayed at "the posh shopping center [[Khan Market]]" in [[Delhi, India|Delhi]], India. "More astonishing than the images blown up large as life was the number of shoppers who seemed not to register them," Sengupta wrote. No memorial to the partition victims exists in India, according to Pramod Kapoor, head of Roli, the Indian publishing house coming out with the new book.&lt;ref name="Sengupta"/&gt;

She had a knack for being at the right place at the right time: she interviewed and photographed [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] just a few hours before his assassination in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Halfway to Freedom: A Report on the New India in the Words and Photographs of Margaret Bourke-White|last=Bourke-White|first=Margaret|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1949|isbn=|location=New York|pages=225–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]], her friend and colleague, said one of her strengths was that there was no assignment and no picture that was unimportant to her. She also started the first photography laboratory at ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="gallerym.com"/&gt;

==Later years and death==

In 1953, Bourke-White developed her first symptoms of [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt; She was forced to slow her career to fight encroaching paralysis.&lt;ref name="scout productions.com" /&gt; In 1959 and 1961, she underwent several operations to treat her condition,&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt; which effectively ended her tremors but affected her speech.&lt;ref name="scout productions.com" /&gt; In 1971, she died at [[Stamford Hospital]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]], aged 67, from Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name="GettyArtist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DicArtists"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ObitNYT"&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Margaret Bourke-White, Photo-Journalist, Dead at 67 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB061FFD3D591A7493CAAB1783D85F458785F9|quote=Margaret Bourke-White, one of the world's pre-eminent photographers, died yesterday morning at the Stamford (Conn.)

Bourke-White wrote an autobiography, ''Portrait of Myself'', which was published in 1963 and became a bestseller, but she grew increasingly infirm and isolated in her home in [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], Connecticut. In her living room, there "was wallpapered in one huge, floor-to-ceiling, perfectly-stitched-together black-and-white photograph of an evergreen forest that she had shot in Czechoslovakia in 1938". A pension plan set up in the 1950s, "though generous for that time", no longer covered her health-care costs. She also suffered financially from her personal generosity and "less-than-responsible attendant care."&lt;ref name="scout productions.com" /&gt;

==Legacy==

Bourke-White's photographs are in the [[Brooklyn Museum]], the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], the [[New Mexico Museum of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Margaret Bourke-White|url=http://sam.nmartmuseum.org/view/objects/asimages/People$00401706?t:state:flow=2c05d3d1-20d6-49d5-8a09-3ec7d3f51cd2|publisher=[[New Mexico Museum of Art]]|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York as well as in the collection of the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="gallerym.com"/&gt; A 160-foot long photomural she created for NBC in 1933, for the Rotunda in the broadcaster's Rockefeller Center headquarters, was destroyed in the 1950s. In 2014, when the Rotunda and Grand Staircase leading up to it were rebuilt, the photomural was faithfully recreated in digital form on the 360-degree LED screens on the Rotunda's walls. It forms one of the stops on the NBC Studio Tour.

Many of her manuscripts, memorabilia, photographs, and negatives are housed in [[Syracuse University]]'s Bird Library Special Collections section.

'''Micropatterning''' is the art of [[miniaturisation]] of [[patterns]]. Especially used for [[electronics]], it has recently{{when|date=May 2011}} become a standard in [[biomaterials]] engineering and for fundamental research on [[cellular biology]] by mean of [[soft lithography]]. It generally uses [[photolithography]] methods but many techniques have been developed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17538708 | doi=10.1039/b618545b | volume=7 | issue=6 | title=Comparative study and improvement of current cell micro-patterning techniques. | date=Jun 2007 | journal=Lab Chip | pages=672–80 | last1 = Fink | first1 = J | last2 = Théry | first2 = M | last3 = Azioune | first3 = A | last4 = Dupont | first4 = R | last5 = Chatelain | first5 = F | last6 = Bornens | first6 = M | last7 = Piel | first7 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[cellular biology]], micropatterns can be used to control the geometry of adhesion and substrate rigidity. This tool helped scientists to discover how the environment influences processes such as the orientation of the cell division axis, organelle positioning, cytoskeleton rearrangement cell differentiation and directionality of cell migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7143/full/nature05786.html | volume=447 | doi = 10.1038/nature05786 | title=Experimental and theoretical study of mitotic spindle orientation | journal=Nature | pages=493–496 | pmid=17495931 | last1 = Théry | first1 = M | last2 = Jiménez-Dalmaroni | first2 = A | last3 = Racine | first3 = V | last4 = Bornens | first4 = M | last5 = Jülicher | first5 = F}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 4446331 | pmid=26016478 | doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004245 | volume=11 | title=Geometrical and mechanical properties control actin filament organization | year=2015 | journal=PLoS Comput.

Micropatterns can be made on a wide range of substrates, from [[glass]] to [[polyacrylamide]] and [[Polydimethylsiloxane]] (PDMS). The [[polyacrylamide]] and PDMS in particular come into handy because they let scientists specifically regulate the stiffness of the substrate, and they allow researchers to measure cellular forces ([[traction force microscopy]]). Advanced custom micropatterning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://snf.stanford.edu/SNF/equipment/nSiL/alveole-primo|title=Protein Patterning Protocol|last=|first=|date=|website=Stanford Nanofabrication Facility|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow precise and relatively rapid experiments controlling cell adhesion, cell migration, guidance, 3D confinement and microfabrication of microstructured chips&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alveolelab.com/fields-of-application/|title=Alveole Lab, Fields of Application|last=|first=|date=|website=Alveole Lab|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Using advanced tools, protein patterns can be produced in virtually unlimited numbers (2D/ 3D shapes and volumes).

Nanopatterning of proteins has been achieved through using top-down lithography techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shafagh|first=Reza|last2=Vastesson|first2=Alexander|last3=Guo|first3=Weijin|last4=van der Wijngaart|first4=Wouter|last5=Haraldsson|first5=Tommy|year=2018|title=E-Beam Nanostructuring and Direct Click Biofunctionalization of Thiol–Ene Resist|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.8b03709|journal=ACS Nano|language=en|doi=10.1021/acsnano.8b03709|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aerosol]] micropatterning for biomaterials uses [[spray (liquid drop)|spray]] microscopic characteristics to obtain semi-random patterns particularly well adapted for biomaterials.

The [[Australia]]n '''Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science''' was a portfolio in the [[Government of Australia]] between 1928, when the post was held by [[John Latham (judge)|John Latham]] as the Minister for Industry, and 20 December 2017, when the last incumbent of the office was Senator [[The Honourable|The Hon.]] [[Arthur Sinodinos]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}}, since 24 January 2017.&lt;ref name="sworn in 2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=New federal ministers officially sworn in|url=http://www.skynews.com.au/news/top-stories/2017/01/24/new-ministers-to-be-sworn-in.html |publisher=Sky News |location=Australia|agency=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]] |date=24 January 2017 |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portfolio was supported by the Australian '''Minister for Resources and Northern Australia''', and the last incumbent of the office was [[The Honourable|The Hon.]] [[Matt Canavan]] between 27 October 2017 until 20 December 2017; and the Australian '''Assistant Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science''', and the last incumbent of the office was The Hon. [[Craig Laundy]] between 19 July 2016 until 20 December 2017.

In the [[Government of Australia]], the ministers administered their former portfolios through the [[Department of Industry, Innovation and Science]]. On 20 December 2017 the functions of the department were dissolved into the newly formed [[Department of Jobs and Small Business (Australia)|Department of Jobs and Small Business]].&lt;ref name="AA02017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/aao-amendment-20-december-2017-scanned.pdf |title=Administrative Arrangements Order – amendment made 20 December 2017 |publisher=[[Commonwealth of Australia]] |date=20 December 2017 |accessdate=3 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ncr5380dip.jpg|thumb|NCR 53c80 SCSI controller]]The '''NCR 5380''' is an early [[SCSI]] controller chip developed by [[NCR Corporation|NCR Microelectronics]]. It was popular due to its simplicity and low cost. The 5380 was used in the [[Macintosh Plus]] and in numerous SCSI cards for personal computers, including the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari TT]]. The 5380 was [[second source]]d by several chip makers, including [[AMD]] and [[Zilog]].

The NCR 5380 also made a significant appearance in [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[VAX]] computers, where it was featured on various [[Q-Bus]] modules and as an integrated SCSI controller in numerous [[MicroVAX]], [[VAXstation]] and [[VAXserver]] computers.  Many UMAX SCSI optical scanners also contain the 53C80 chip interfaced to an Intel 8031-series microcontroller.

Single-chip SCSI controller '''NCR 53c400'''&lt;ref&gt;BYTE Magazine, 1988 №9&lt;/ref&gt; used SCSI 5380 core.

[[File:NoTA Main 1.PNG|right|thumb|200px|NoTA Main architecture]]
[[File:NoTA Main 2.png|right|thumb|200px|NoTA Interconnect architecture]]

'''Network on Terminal Architecture''' (i.e. '''NoTA''') is a modular service based system architecture for mobile and embedded devices. NoTA enables mobile device makers speed-up their product development by shortening the integration phase. Additionally NoTA makes it possible to quickly bring-in 3rd party innovations into the products due to loosely coupled and functional-driver -less approach.

NoTA device consists of '''Service Nodes (SN)''' and '''Application Nodes (AN)''' that communicate through logical '''Interconnect (IN)'''. IN provides two basic means of communication, namely message based and streaming type. The former is bi-directional and used for Service Messages. The latter one is uni-directional and used for large amounts of data like media content. Service Nodes have unique '''Service Identifier (SID)'''.

Service Nodes and Application Nodes map into sub-systems consisting of all software and hardware resources needed to implement those. In order to maintain system level modularity, the only way for a node to use SW&amp;HW resources from other sub-systems is through Services Nodes.

Interconnect is divided into two layers, namely '''High Interconnect (H_IN)''' and '''Low Interconnect (L_IN)'''. The former provides means for service activation and deactivation as well as service and stream accesses. Low Interconnect provides network socket interface with uniform addressing mechanism. L_IN internally can be divided into transport network independent and dependent parts. [http://www.mipi.org/ MIPI Alliance] originated solutions are expected to be key enablers for wide use of NoTA.

'''NoTA Sub-system''' provides the physical implementation for a set of Nodes (ANs and/or SNs). Sub-system consists of all the software and hardware resources (including peripherals, memories, controllers, internal buses etc.) needed to implement the defined Nodes. The only means for a sub-system to use the other Sub-systems' resources is via Service Nodes. Every NoTA Sub-system consists of the NoTA Interconnect stack.

'''NoTA principles'''
* Loosely coupled
* Service based
* Interconnect centric
* Message &amp; data driven (GALS)
* Implementation-wise heterogeneous

== History ==
The NoTA concept and the first implementations were the result of internal [http://research.nokia.com/ Nokia Research Center] activities started in 2003. The objective of this work was to develop a novel embedded device architecture that could solve the existing R&amp;D challenges, as well as prepare the company to face the expected horizontalization and [[digital convergence]]. The NoTA basic framework was strongly influenced by [[Network-on-Chip|Network-on-Chip (NoC)]] and [[Web Services]] research. 

NoTA Interconnect '''Release 1''' was released in December 2005. Release 1 only consisted of Service communication, activation/deactivation, discovery and access. '''Release 2''' added efficient data communication means, with a handle based stream referencing approach. This functionality, called DOA (Direct Object Access), allows direct memory-to-memory streaming between different NoTA subsystems. Release 2 came out during the second half of 2006. '''Release 3''' became the official public release comprising all the essential functionalities. Reference implementation source code packages (user-space) can be downloaded from either [http://www.notaworld.org www.notaworld.org] or [http://gitorious.org/nota/ gitorious.org/nota.] Linux Kernel optimized Debian package is also available through [http://gitorious.org/knota/ gitorious.org/knota].

== Benefits in product development==
'''Fast-time-to-market''' is possible due to multiple reasons. Product vendors can purchase already productized NoTA Sub-systems removing time needed for vendor specific requirements definition, implementation and integration phases. In case there are no ready-made products on the market, NoTA type system-level modularity allows technology vendors to do the implementation and testing without heavy involvement with other Sub-system provides (e.g. the application engine). 

'''Scalability in integration level''' allows product companies to do fast cost optimization without major extra R&amp;D effort. NoTA core is physical interconnect agnostic and hence replacing e.g. off-chip interconnect with on-chip interconnect does not destroy the device functionality. More practical example is to integrate multiple ICs into the same package (e.g. through stacking) and use package internal interconnect technologies.

'''Cost reduction''' in product development can be achieved in two dimensions. Firstly system-level modularity allows free and fair competition between different technology vendors reducing Sub-system costs. Secondly in many cases product vendors do not have to bear costs incurring from sub-system adaptation work specific to their technologies.

'''Performance and features meeting end-user needs'''. Product companies are more agile to adopt new technology or technology that better meets users' needs in digital convergence devices.

== Future Development ==
Due to being agnostic to transport technology, NoTA can be used for many inter-device use-cases (wireless based L_INdown). There are currently projects running e.g. in Finland ([http://www.tivit.fi/en/device SHOK DIEM]) and in Japan to apply NoTA in the ubiquitous world. An excellent outcome revealed in the [http://www.tronshow.org/index-e.html TronShow2010] is the intelligent house built in Taiwan utilizing both the T-Kernel and NoTA technologies. In addition, VTT (Technical Research Center of Finland) has demonstrated their NoTA (and Smart M3) based intelligent [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBiZKInFm-8 Greenhouse.]

Extending NoTA to the Internet is one of the research topics. So called NoTA Virtual Device (NVD) is expected to provide a solution here. Through the NVD one can build combined service platforms where the services can be running intra-device, inter-device and/or in the Internet.

'''Nicole Stenger''' is a French-born American artist, pioneer in [[Virtual Reality]] and Internet movies. In 1989–1991, she was a research Fellow at [[MIT]] (CAVS &amp; Visual Arts Program, now merged into ACT). In 1991–1992, she was a Visiting Scholar at the Human Interface Technology Laboratory (Hitlab) in Seattle. Her works have been featured in the [[SIGGRAPH]] Art Show, the FILE Festival, the JavaMuseum, the Cartier Art Foundation and are part of the Archive of Digital Art (ADA). In 2013, she was included in the "Contemporary women artists on the web" collection of the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]], in Washington DC.

Between 1989 and 1992, she created ''Angels'', the first immersive movie. The project foundation was laid out at the Visual Arts Program at MIT, employing [[Wavefront Technologies|Wavefront]]'s Advanced Visualizer on a [[Silicon Graphics]] personal IRIS. The VR work was done at the Hitlab (University of Washington) using VPL's Virtualization interface and its Body Electric software running on the IRIS. {{double image|right|StengerAngels_left.jpg|200|StengerAngels_right.jpg|200|A movie still from Angels (1989-1991).|The VRML version of Angels.}}Angels is a real-time interactive immersive movie, a kind of travel in a virtual paradise. The participant uses a VPL [[Dataglove]] and high-resolution HRX goggles developed by [[Jaron Lanier]]. Following Tom Furness' theory, the artwork was developed for the three senses: vision, audio and touch, though the technological restraints at the time could only implement vision, audio, and a non tactile data glove. Each user starts his/her experience in front of an odd carousel that is a passage to more VR worlds. Touching one of the three angels’ hearts in the carousel, defines the range in which the following three segments will appear. The duration of the sections varies from just about 30" to 2'30".&lt;ref&gt;Thome 1995, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The brilliantly colourful environments are a gateway to more scenes. The angels' voices ask the users to interact with them, causing a story to open. The music was composed by [[Diane Thome]].
While at MIT, Stenger also contributed to the seminal ''Cyberspace First Steps'' edited by [[Michael Benedikt (urbanist)|Michael L. Benedikt]] with the now famous essay "Mind is a Leaking Rainbow".&lt;ref&gt;Stenger 1991, p. 48-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online works ==

In the 1990s, after the completion of her VR project, Stenger worked on [[VRML]] works and developed online art projects that are early examples of web cinema. ''My Faux Cinema''’s website (1998–2003) was a project composed of web pages with animated gifs, java applets, open source audio files, textual parts written by Stenger or sampled from the Internet. It included VRML movies, web books and “faux films”. Stenger’s web books, ''To Dream or Not to Eat'' (1998), ''California Trilogy'' (1996-2000), ''Nature'' (2000), ''Nanfei in Waspland'' (2000) show her innovative spirit.A web book is a kind of book with a story, a cover, an introduction, a conclusion, and a narrative of seven to twelve pages. The “faux films”, ''Fresh!'' (2000) and ''Bitchery'' (2001), are stylistic jokes. They mimic cinema moving images through javascripts.

==Recent works==
{{double image|left|Stenger-Chambers2001.jpg|150|Stenger-Dynasty2007-9.jpg|150|A movie still from Chambers(2001)|A movie still from Dynasty (2007-2009)}}
[[File:Stenger-Isle2009-11.jpg|right|thumb|A movie still from The Isle That Was A Book (2011).]]

During the first decade of the 21st century, Stenger worked on a series of VRML movies and environments, which, though she had no more access to VR interfaces, were still conceived for immersion. In 2001 she created ''Chambers''. The movie, completed days before 9/11, is an emotional journey through the different stages of a dying love. Towards the end of the decade, Stenger concluded her Virtual Reality trilogy with ''Dynasty'' (2007-2009). Dynasty is composed of 15 scenes with music by Tchaikovsky. The movie is a travel through time, in which users revisit their childhood and meet their ancestors from a remote past.

In 2011 Stenger completed ''The Isle That Was A Book'', another VRML piece, based on a 1970s Beat Poetry book with 14 texts read by Stenger. In 2012, she composed a short story for Twitter called ''IS IT U, I U?'' ''(I U=Internet Unicorn)''. Her last published work is ''TheyNuked My Lettuce!'' (2012). Created in [[Machinima]] style, this 3D/2D animation is a cautionary tale on the effects of cyberwar on our daily lives.

'''Optoelectronics''' is the study and application of [[electronics|electronic]] devices and systems that source, detect and control [[light]], usually considered a sub-field of [[photonics]].  In this context, ''light'' often includes invisible forms of radiation such as [[gamma ray]]s, [[X-ray]]s, [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]], in addition to visible light.  Optoelectronic devices are electrical-to-optical or optical-to-electrical [[transducer]]s, or instruments that use such devices in their operation.  
''[[Electro-optics]]'' is often erroneously used as a synonym, but is a wider branch of [[physics]] that concerns all interactions between light and [[electric field]]s, whether or not they form part of an electronic device.

Optoelectronics is based on the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effects of [[light]] on electronic materials, especially [[semiconductors]], sometimes in the presence of [[electric field]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.element-14.com/community/docs/DOC-22516/l/physics-and-technology--vishay-optoelectronics ''Physics and Technology - Vishay Optoelectronics''] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516081725/http://www.element-14.com/community/docs/DOC-22516/l/physics-and-technology--vishay-optoelectronics |date=2016-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Head from a short pike.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The head of a short firefighter's pike pole]]

'''Pike poles''' are long metal-topped wood, aluminum, or fiberglass poles used for reaching, holding, or pulling. They are variously used in construction, logging, rescue and recovery, power line maintenance, and firefighting.&lt;ref name=tott&gt;"Tools of the Trade: Firefighting Hand Tools and Their Use", PennWell Books, 1997, {{ISBN|0912212624}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MJQaMcM038wC&amp;pg=PT72 Chapter 5, "Poles"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Loggers klaralven.jpg|thumb|left|Pike poles being used on a log drive]]
[[File:Uittokeksi.JPG|thumb|Pike pole heads of the type often used in river drives, these are displayed in the forestry museum Lusto in Punkaharju, Finland.]]

{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
The pole's original use in the fire service was to pull down walls and neighboring buildings to stop a fire's spread.  Modern firefighting pike poles are usually of fiberglass, 4–12' long, and used to search for fires hidden behind walls and ceilings, to pull items from intense heat and flames, and to [[ventilation (firefighting)|ventilate]] structures by breaking windows.  Also known as a ''ceiling hook of the day'', the pike pole is the 'hook' referred to in '[[Hook-and-ladder truck|hook and ladder]]' truck.&lt;ref name=tott/&gt;

In [[construction]] pike poles (pick pole, spike pole) are used to lift the sides of [[timber framing|timber framed]] structures, as in [[barn raising]] and utility poles. In [[log driving]] they are called rafters' hooks and are used to maneuver floating logs.

In [[lumbering]] they are used to control logs floating on a river in a [[log driving|log drive]] and constructing log rafts. Pike poles used in log rafting were originally made of wood, typically spruce or fir. In the mid-1960s they began to be made of aluminum tubing plugged with a wooden knob to maintain buoyancy. Specialized [[logging]] tools of similar appearance are [[peavey (tool)|peavey]] and [[cant hook]].

Pike poles are also used for rescue work to grab people or objects floating in high and rough waters.

[[Lineman (technician)|Linemen]] use pike poles to maintain power lines. In the early days of line construction pike poles were used to stand up the utility poles.

The tool can also be used in salvage events in such things as constructing water chutes to displace water.

===Pike pole fishing===
[[File:Багренье.jpg|thumb|left|The pike-pole ice fishing day on the Ural]]
In the past, pike poles were used for [[ice fishing]], known as ''bagrenye ryby'' ( "fish pike-poling"; ''[[wikt:багор|bagor]]'' means "pike pole" in Russian). A number of ethnographers note that this way was specific to the [[Ural River]]. When fish starts to hybernate, fisherman ''[[artel]]s'' in large numbers put pike poles into ice holes in places known for big fish to crowd, so that a dense forest is made of pike poles. When drifting fish hits a pole, a fisherman feels this and pulls the catch out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%AD%D0%A1%D0%91%D0%95/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D1%80%D1%8B%D0%B1%D1%8B "Bagrenye ryby"] in  ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1835 Russian ''Encyclopedic Lexicon'' describes a tradition of [[Ural Cossacks]] [[ice fishing]] for [[sturgeon]]. The pike-pole ice fishing of sturgeon was traditionally allowed some time after the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christmas. On the day of ''bagrenye'', the Cossacks would break the river ice at the known sturgeon [[hibernation|hibernating]] locations, and pull out the disturbed fish with the pike poles. A successful Cossack would sometimes catch as many as 50 sturgeon. Occasionally a [[Beluga (sturgeon)|beluga]] was caught, and pulled out by a crowd. Only active-duty Cossacks were allowed to take part in this enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdwTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA65

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9045">'''Project engineering''' includes all parts of the design of manufacturing or processing facilities, either new or modifications to and expansions of existing facilities.  A "project" consists of a coordinated series of activities or tasks performed by engineers, designers, [[drafter]]s and others from one or more engineering disciplines or departments.  Project tasks consist of such things as performing calculations, writing specifications, preparing bids, reviewing equipment proposals and evaluating or selecting equipment and preparing various lists, such as equipment and materials lists, and creating drawings such as electrical, [[piping and instrumentation diagram]]s, physical layouts and other drawings used in design and construction. A small project may be under the direction of a project engineer. Large projects are typically under the direction of a [[project manager]] or management team.  Some facilities have in house staff to handle small projects, while some major companies have a department that does internal project engineering. Large projects are typically contracted out to engineering companies.  Staffing at engineering companies varies according to the work load and duration of employment may only last until an individual's tasks are completed.

==Overview==

===Responsibilities===
The role of the project engineer can often be described as that of a liaison between the project manager and the technical disciplines involved in a project. The distribution of "liasing" and performing tasks within the technical disciplines can vary wildly from project-to-project.  This often depends on the type of product, it's maturity, and the size of the company, to name a few.  It is important for a Project Engineer to understand that balance.  The Project Engineer should be knowledgeable enough to be able to speak intelligently within the various disciplines, and not purely be a liaison -- such project engineers who only "liaise" can more accurately be characterized as "lazy".  The project engineer is also often the primary technical point of contact for the consumer.

A project engineer's responsibilities include schedule preparation, pre-planning and resource forecasting for engineering and other technical activities relating to the project. They may also be in charge of performance management of [[vendor]]s. They assure the accuracy of financial forecasts, which tie-in to project schedules.  They ensure projects are completed according to project plans. Project engineers manage project team resources and training and develop extensive project management experience and expertise. 

When project teams are structured so that multiple specialty disciplines report to the project engineer, then two important responsibilities of the project engineer are inter-discipline coordination and overall quality control of the work.&lt;ref name=Herbst&gt;{{cite conference |last=Herbst |first=Andrew |author2=Hans Verwijs |title=Project Engineering: Interdisciplinary Coordination and Overall Engineering Quality Control |book-title=Proc. of the Annual IAC conference of the American Society for Engineering Management |date=Oct 19–22, 2011 |volume=1 |isbn=9781618393616 |pages=15–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering companies===
When used, an engineering company is generally contracted to design a project to achieve some specific objective, ranging in scope from simple modifications to new factories or expansions costing hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.  The client usually provides the engineering company with a scoping document listing the details of the objective in terms of such things as production rate and product specifications and general to specific information about processes and equipment to be used and the expected deliverables, such as calculations, drawings, lists, specifications, schedules, etc. The client is typically involved in the entire design process and makes decisions throughout, including the technology, type of equipment to use, bid evaluation and supplier selection, the layout of equipment and operational considerations.  Depending on the project the engineering company may perform material and energy balances to size equipment and to quantify inputs of materials and energy (steam, electric power, fuel). This information is used to write specifications for the equipment.  The equipment specifications are sent out for bids.  The client, the engineering company or both select the equipment.  The equipment suppliers provide drawings of the equipment, which are used by the engineering company's mechanical engineers, designers and [[drafter]]s to make general arrangement drawings, which show how the pieces of equipment are located in relation to other equipment. Layout drawings show specific information about the equipment, electric motors powering the equipment and such things as auxiliary equipment (pumps, fans, air compressors), piping and buildings. The engineering company maintains an equipment list with major equipment, auxiliary equipment, motors, etc. Electrical engineers are involved with power supply to motors and equipment.  Process engineers perform material and energy balances and design the [[piping and instrumentation diagram]]s to show how equipment is supplied with process fluids, water, air, gases, etc. and the type of control loops used.   The instrumentation and controls engineers specify the instrumentation and controls and handle any computer controls and control rooms.  Civil and structural engineers deal with site layout and engineering and structural concerns like foundations, pads, structures, supports and bracing for equipment.  Environmental engineers deal with any air emissions and treatment of liquid effluent.

===Fields and topics===

The various fields and topics that projects engineers are involved with include:

*[[Work breakdown structure]]: a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components
*[[Gantt chart]]:  type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule
*[[Critical Path Analysis]]: an algorithm for scheduling a set of project activities
*[[Program evaluation and review technique]]: a statistical tool which was designed to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project
*[[Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique]]: network analysis technique that allows probabilistic treatment both network logic and estimation of activity duration
*[[Petri Nets]]: one of several mathematical modeling languages for the description of distributed systems

==Construction industry==
Project engineers are often project managers with qualifications in engineering or [[construction management]]. Other titles include field engineer, [[Construction engineering|construction engineer]], or construction project engineer. In smaller projects, this person may also be responsible for contracts and will be called an assistant project manager. A similar role is undertaken by a client's engineer or [[owner's engineer]], but by inference, these often act more in the interests of the commissioning company.

Project engineers do not necessarily do [[Design engineer|design]] work, but instead represent the contractor or client out in the field, help [[tradesman|tradespeople]] interpret the job's designs, ensure the job is constructed according to the project plans, and assist [[Cost engineering|project controls]], including budgeting, scheduling, and planning. In some cases a project engineer is responsible for assisting the assigned project manager with regard to design and a project and with the execution of one or more simultaneous projects in accordance with a valid, executed contract, per company policies and procedures and work instructions for customized and standardized plants.

Typical responsibilities may include: daily operations of field work activities and organization of [[subcontractor]]s; coordination of the implementation of a project, ensuring it is being built correctly; project schedules and forecasts; interpretation of drawings for [[tradesmen]]; review of engineering deliverables; redlining drawings; regular project status reports; budget monitoring and trend tracking; bill of materials creation and maintenance; effective communications between engineering, technical, construction, and project controls groups; and assistance to the project manager.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3008">A '''remote sensing software''' is a [[software application]] that processes [[remote sensing]] data. Remote sensing applications are similar to [[graphics software]], but they enable generating [[geographic]] information from satellite and airborne [[sensor]] data. Remote sensing applications read specialized file formats that contain sensor image data, georeferencing information, and sensor [[metadata]]. Some of the more popular remote sensing file formats include: [[GeoTIFF]], [[National Imagery Transmission Format|NITF]], [[JPEG 2000]], [[ECW (file format)]], [[MrSID]], [[Hierarchical Data Format|HDF]], and [[NetCDF]].

Remote Sensing applications perform many features including:
* Change Detection — Determine the changes from images taken at different times of the same area
* [[Orthorectification]] — Warp an image to its location on the earth.
* Spectral Analysis — For example, using non-visible parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] to determine if a forest is healthy
*Image Classification — Categorization of pixels based on reflectance into different land cover classes (e.g. Supervised classification, Unsupervised classification and Object Oriented Classification)

Many remote sensing applications are built using common remote sensing toolkits, like [[GDAL]] and [http://www.ossim.org/ OSSIM].

'''Roedvig (Rødvig) Shipmotor Museum''' is a Danish "Self-owned Institution" founded in 1987 in [[Rødvig]], [[Zealand]], [[Denmark]]. It is one of several technical museums in Denmark. As of 2013 the museum has a collection of approximately 400 different engines, produced mostly by now defunct Danish factories over the period 1898 to 1974. The engines range in size from small outboards up to one German MTU medium-sized diesel of 2 000&amp;nbsp;hp.

At one time or another there were about 140 different producers of marine engines in Denmark. In 2013, only five of those 140 companies are still active: Hundested Propeller, Burmeister &amp; Wain, Grenaa Motor Fabrik, Callesen Diesel (merged with Bukh), &amp; Bukh Diesel (merged with Callesen). Engines from over half of the former 140 Danish producers can be found at the museum. Some of these are in working order and can be run within the museum. Four such ready-to-run engines are hot-bulb semi-diesel types from: "Tuxham", "Hein &amp; Sons", "Dan", and "Danmark" (Rudkøbing). The museum exhibits comprise a spectrum of marine engine development from 1898 onwards, as well as charting the simultaneous slow decline towards near extinction of marine engine manufacture in Denmark.

The museum's collection includes many other maritime articles besides engines. The museum also has an archive with extensive documention and technical material about various engines and their manufacturers. It commemorated its 25th anniversary in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=hfi|title=Lugten af gamle skibsmotorer er autentiske|newspaper=Køge Dagbladet|date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Shadowbox (sterile).JPG|thumb|A shadow box for a US soldier who served during the [[Iraq War]]]]
A '''shadow box''' is an enclosed glass-front [[display case]] containing an object or objects presented in a thematic grouping with artistic or personal significance. The grouping of the objects and the depth effect created by their relative heights from the backing creates a dramatic visual result.

==Artistic and personal shadow boxes==
While shadow boxes have a strong tradition in military history, they are also frequently created purely for artistic goals. Shadow boxes are sometimes built by amateur crafters, as a way of preserving and presenting artifacts of historic or personal nostalgic value.

American artist [[Joseph Cornell]] constructed many shadow boxes during his career, with the works evoking a strong sense of [[nostalgia]], decay, or loss.

==Military shadow boxes==
By tradition, shadow boxes are typically presented to members of the [[military]] upon [[retirement]]. These shadow boxes will usually contain the various [[medal]]s and [[award]]s a person has earned through a military career, the [[flag]]s of both their country and their military service branch, and their final badge of [[Military rank|rank]].

Traditionally, military personnel would keep all their personal belongings in a [[Trunk (luggage)|trunk]] which would accompany them on their travels. During the retirement ceremony or upon retirement, many members of the military, particularly in the naval service, use the lift out tray found in a well-worn trunk as their shadow box.  Some retirees also maximize the display space found in these trunks by also incorporating shadow boxes into the lid compartment as well. An added benefit by having a shadow box in an antique trunk is all of the storage space for uniforms, hats, photograph albums, and any other service memorabilia collected over the years.

In the United States, some businesses specialize in the construction and sale of shadow boxes, at prices ranging from just a few dollars to several hundred. People often purchase these in order to preserve and still enjoy viewing [[memorabilia]]. A similar case, called a '''uniform [[display case]]''', displays an entire military uniform with correct insignia placement.

===History===
Military shadow boxes were originally simple boxes in which sailors retiring from shipboard service carried their belongings ashore. Superstition held that if the sailor's shadow touched shore before he set foot upon it, he would suffer ill luck. By carrying his belongings, a metaphorical "shadow" of himself, enclosed within the box he could ensure he would touch land before his "shadow".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plaquesandpatches.com/blog/2013/07/01/military-shadow-boxes-their-history-and-tradition/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shop fitting''' ('''shopfitting''') is the trade of fitting out [[retail]] and service [[Retailing|shops]] and [[Retailing|stores]] with equipment, fixtures and fittings. The trade applies to all kinds of outlets from small corner shops to [[hypermarket]]s. A '''shop fitter''' executes planning, [[design]]s shop layout and installs equipment and services. A shop fitting [[business entity|firm]] typically incorporates professional expertise in [[interior design]], manufacturing of [[bespoke]] furniture, signage and fittings (with own or [[outsourcing|outsourced]] facilities) and purchasing of retail equipment.

A shop fitting cycle begins with a survey and measurement of available space and preparing design drawings for submission to the client. Alternatively, the client may have their own drawings prepared by an independent interior designer. The shop fitter arranges for purchase of standard equipment and merchandise or production of bespoke furniture, delivers and physically installs them—until the shop is ready for daily operation.

There are different requirements to the different branches and types of shop. [[Fashion]] shop design requires up-to-the-minute awareness of current trends in colour and style to create stores that will draw customers in.

==Systems==
''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Shopfitting system''' refers to a product range made to satisfy the needs of shopfitters and ultimately retailers for display and [[merchandising]] goods. A shopfitting system can be adapted from combinations of standardized components for a particular retail application. A manufacturer would normally launch new shopfitting systems on a 2-year basis. Leading manufacturers would offer design oriented systems, followers would reinterpret them making the display solution achievable with as many as existing items as possible, hoping that retailers will choose their product because of the cheap price.

Shopfitting systems are usually connected to a "modular" concept, meaning that each item has more than one use. This economically goes into the rules of "network", where one element has the value of three, if added to another element, because 1x1=1 but 2x2=4: an extra item designed and compatible with others, has very high value.

== Shop Fitting Profession ==
'''Shop Fitting''' is a profession that involves the fitting of retail outlets like corner shops, department stores, convenience stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets with equipment, fixtures and fittings. It’s carried out by a shop fitter who executes all planning, design, layout and installation of equipment and services. A '''shop fitter''' brings interior design expertise and assists in the design of bespoke furniture, fittings and signage and also with the buying of retail equipment.

The process begins with a survey of the retail premises and measurement of available space. The next stage is the preparation of design, which is then submitted to the client for review and approval. Some clients provide their own design drawings that are prepared by another interior designer.  Finally, the shop fitter arranges for the purchase of standard equipment and the production of the bespoke furniture, which is delivered and installed – ready for the shop operation. 

Shop fitting is a precision orientated profession that requires intricacy and exceptional attention to detail in order to meet client requirements. Visual elements heavily impact customer behaviour hence why shop fitting is now at the forefront of attracting new customers to stores across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lake|first1=Dean|title=Shop Fitting|url=https://lakecontracts.co.uk/service/shop-fitting/|website=Lake Contracts|publisher=Lake Contracts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stone picker Kivi-Pekka for Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Tractor powered stone picker working at field.]]
A '''stone picker''' (or '''rock picker''') is an [[List of agricultural machinery|implement]] to sieve through the top layer of [[soil]] to separate and collect [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and soil debris from good topsoil. It is usually [[tractor]]-pulled. A stone picker is similar in function to a rock windrower (rock rake); a stone picker generally digs to greater depths to remove stones and rocks.

Stone pickers are used in farming and landscaping, where stones need to be removed from the soil and ground surface to prevent damage to other farm machinery (such as [[Baler|hay balers]], [[combine harvester|combines]], and [[mower]]s), improve the soil for crop production, or improve the appearance of the ground surface in preparation for a lawn or a golf course. Surface stones and large rocks often left from plowing can damage a hay bailer, the header or reciprocating knives on a combine, and blades on a [[rotary mower]]. Land with rock instead of fine soil are often less useful for crops. Thus, removing stones from the soil also ensures a more consistent yield. Additionally, using stone pickers is particularly useful for crops forming tubers (such as potatoes) in the ground.

A stone picker has digging teeth, a conveyor system, a sieve or screen, and a stone bin. The digging teeth are at the leading edge of the stone picker and removes soil, which is placed on the conveyor system. If the sieve is not combined with the conveyor system, the conveyor system transports the stones and large rocks to a bin or hopper for periodic dumping. Some stone pickers use a large tractor, generally over 100 [[horsepower]], equipped with hydraulics and [[power take-off]] driven mechanisms. PTO pump driven equipment can use 60 horsepower tractors. The tractor's hydraulics control the depth to which the stone picker digs to excavate soil material; whereas, the PTO controls the movement of the conveyor and picking system.stone collecting machine made in college of agriculture engineering and technology in junagadh agriculture university junagadh.

(1 [[astronomical unit|AU]] and 1 [[Parsec|pc]] are not to scale, 1 pc = ~206265 AU) What TAU would do is use its distance from the Earth to make the parallax measurement, so rather than just 1 AU as with an Earth-based annual parallax it would be hundreds of AU. This would increase the distance measurement horizon from about 500 light years for the [[Hipparcos]] satellite to 250 000 light years.]]
'''TAU''' ('''Thousand Astronomical Units''') was a proposed unmanned [[space probe]] that would go to a distance of one thousand [[astronomical units]] (1000 AU) from the Earth and Sun by NASA/JPL in 1987 using tested technology. One scientific purpose would be to measure the distance to other stars via [[stellar parallax]]. Studies continued into 1990, working with a launch in the 2005–2010 timeframe.

It was a proposed [[nuclear electric rocket]] spacecraft that used a 1 [[megawatt|MW]] fission reactor and an [[ion drive]] (with a burn time of about 10 years) to reach a distance of 1000 AU in 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|bibcode=1987STIN...8728490E|title=Preliminary scientific rationale for a voyage to a thousand astronomical units|publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary goal of the mission was to improve parallax measurements of the distances to stars inside and outside the [[Milky Way]], with secondary goals being the study of the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]], measurements of conditions in the [[interstellar medium]], and (via communications with Earth) tests of [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/1987/PV1987_1049.pdf|title=Tau - A Mission to a Thousand Astronomical Units|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930183557/http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/1987/PV1987_1049.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the tasks envisioned for TAU would be a flyby of [[Pluto]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kEjNBGzDDfEC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;lpg=PA429&amp;dq=TAU+%28spacecraft%29&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2MLZ4m8Cd0&amp;sig=8i8gSANoi1vnMLthNDN8ZFI5-NA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCWoVChMIw-CIpr6zyAIVQ_ceCh3vjAB6#v=onepage&amp;q=TAU%20%28spacecraft%29&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; A Pluto flyby was achieved in 2015 by the [[New Frontiers program]] mission ''[[New Horizons]]''.

Some of the instruments proposed for the design included a 1.5-meter telescope for observations and a 1-meter telescope for laser communication with Earth.&lt;ref name="NewScientist"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vtI9MPk3oVkC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=speed+of+the+TAU+spacecraft&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s5Bb4l2MSK&amp;sig=NxA9DZEviP6aOKRTVnMeE75cMTU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwB2oVChMI19vk8cGzyAIVyhseCh1kNgT3#v=onepage&amp;q=speed%20of%20the%20TAU%20spacecraft&amp;f=false New Scientist Dec 10, 1987 - And Now for the Stars]&lt;/ref&gt;

After launch it would accelerate to about 106&amp;nbsp;km/s (about 22.4 AU/year) over 10 years, using [[xenon]] as propellant and a nuclear fission reactor for power.&lt;ref name="NewScientist" /&gt;

==Description and mission profile&lt;ref&gt;Interavia Space Directory 1990-91 edited by Andrew Wilson (page 88), Jane's Information Group, {{ISBN|0 7106 0646 X}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
*Payload module (5,000&amp;nbsp;kg mass including a 10-watt laser transponder+1-meter-[[aperture]] laser communications telescope capable of transmitting data at 20 kilobits/second at 1000 AU, and a 1.5 meter astrometric telescope plus other experiments)
*Propulsion module (4,000&amp;nbsp;kg dry mass including ten 4.45 [[newton (unit)|newton]] thrust ion propulsion clustered in groups of five and fired paired for two years each. The total specific mass of ion thrusters, power processor units, etc. would be 4&amp;nbsp;kg/kWe)
*1-MWe Nuclear reactor+shield+radiator (6,000&amp;nbsp;kg mass or 12.5&amp;nbsp;kg/kWe specific mass)

The 25,000&amp;nbsp;kg (gross launch mass including 10,000&amp;nbsp;kg of [[xenon]] propellant) ''TAU'' spacecraft would have been launched into a low Earth orbit by the [[Space Shuttle]] in 2005-2010. Once deployed, a central boom would have telescoped the three main units listed above to a total 40 meter length to separate the payload from the nuclear reactor. The ion propulsion/xenon propellant module would have been positioned close to the [[center of gravity]], its 250&amp;nbsp;km/s&lt;ref&gt;http://interstellar-flight.ru/02/tau/tau.htm&lt;/ref&gt; exhaust velocity ion engines providing an acceleration of 0.35 mm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. ''TAU'' would have attained [[Earth escape velocity]] in 250 days in a spiralling orbit, followed by Solar System escape speed 700 days later.

The ''TAU'' payload module would have separated from the rest of the spacecraft after ten years of constant thruster firing at a distance of 12 billion km (80 AU)&lt;ref&gt;Solar System Log by Andrew Wilson (page 125), Jane's Publishing Company Limited, 1987, {{ISBN|0 7106 0444 0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the xenon propellant tanks would have been depleted. ''TAU'' would have reached 200 AU in 15 years after launch, 400 AU in 23 years, 600 AU in 32 years, 800 AU in 41 years and the full 1000 AU in half a century. Even so, it would have traversed less than 0.4% of the 4.3 light years to [[Alpha Centauri]], the nearest star.

The '''Transit Elevated Bus''' (TEB) ({{zh|s=巴铁|t=巴鐵|p=Bā Tiě}}) was a proposed new [[bus]] concept where a [[guided bus]] straddles above road traffic, giving it the alternative names such as '''straddling bus''', '''straddle bus''', '''land airbus''', or '''tunnel bus''' by international media.

A trial was scheduled to begin in [[Beijing|Beijing's]] [[Mentougou District]] by late 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cntv.cn/english/special/news/20100825/103552.shtml 3D Express Coach to be put into trial in Beijing] CNTV.news, August 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However the project was not given authorisation by the district authorities because the technology was considered to be too immature, and further trials were subject to the development of a concept to prove the system actually works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantollways.com/2013/08/07/the-straddling-bus/|script-title=The Straddling Bus|date=August 7, 2013|accessdate=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT052016/&gt; The city of [[Manaus]], [[Brazil]], has also evaluated the option of installing a straddle bus in its city streets.&lt;ref name=Manaus/&gt; At the time of the 2016 unveiling of the scale model, it was reported that a prototype would be deployed by mid 2016 in [[Qinhuangdao]].

==History==
The idea of Transit Elevated Bus was proposed in 1969 by two American architects, Craig Hodgetts and Lester Walker, as a public transport concept called the "Bos-Wash Landliner".&lt;ref name=citylab&gt;{{cite web|last=Poon|first=Linda|title=Can China's Futuristic 'Straddling Bus' Finally Become a Reality?|url=http://www.citylab.com/tech/2016/05/can-chinas-futuristic-straddling-bus-finally-become-a-reality/483953/|accessdate=August 3, 2016|work=CityLab|date=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, another version was designed by [[Shenzhen]] Hashi Future Parking Equipment Company (深圳華世未來泊車設備有限公司), and the concept, known as '''3D Express Bus''' (立体快巴) at the time, was unveiled at the 13th Beijing International High-tech Expo in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/riding-high-a-chinese-concept-for-bus-transit|title=Riding High: A Chinese Concept for Bus Transit|work=New York Times|date=August 5, 2010|first=Daniel|last=McDermon|accessdate=August 10, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100907055742/http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/riding-high-a-chinese-concept-for-bus-transit| archivedate=September 7, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.hk/cgi-bin/nw/show.cgi/32/1/1/1813231/1.html|script-title=zh:北京試驗立體快巴|work=Ming Pao |location=Hong Kong|date=August 7, 2010|accessdate=August 10, 2010|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; A working scale model was showcased at the 2016 Beijing International High-Tech Expo.&lt;ref name=Guardian052016/&gt;

==Description==
In [[People's Republic of China|China]] there are four main modes of [[public transport]]ation: [[rapid transit|subway]], [[light rail]], [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT), and normal buses. The express coach would be a substitute for BRT and augment its advantages. To modify the road for the bus, two options are available: rails can be laid on the edges of the lanes that the bus occupies, or two white lines can be painted on the road to facilitate use of [[autopilot]] technology.&lt;ref name=chinahush/&gt; Rails would offer less wheel [[rolling resistance]] and better [[energy efficiency in transportation|energy efficiency]]. For either option, it may be necessary to widen the lanes occupied by the bus to accommodate the bus wheels and undercarriage whilst allowing other vehicles to pass under the bus two abreast. Since the bus is no higher than a [[tractor-trailer]], roadway [[overpass]]es will usually not be a problem.

The bus would run along a fixed route, its passenger compartment spanning the width of two traffic lanes. Its undercarriage rides along the edges of the two lanes it straddles and the overall height is {{convert|4|to|4.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="chinahush"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinahush.com/2010/07/31/straddling-bus-a-cheaper-greener-and-faster-alternative-to-commute|title="Straddling" bus–a cheaper, greener and faster alternative to commute|publisher=Chinahush.com|date=July 31, 2010|last=Lee|first=Annie|accessdate=August 10, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100803145421/http://www.chinahush.com/2010/07/31/straddling-bus-a-cheaper-greener-and-faster-alternative-to-commute| archivedate=August 3, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT081710"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/18/business/global/18bus.html|title=‘Straddling Bus’ Offered as a Traffic Fix in China|first=Bettina|last=Wassener|work=New York Times|date=August 17, 2010|accessdate=September 22, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111025034632/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/18/business/global/18bus.html| archivedate=October 25, 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicles lower than {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high will be able to pass underneath the bus, reducing the number of [[traffic jam]]s caused by ordinary buses loading and unloading at [[bus stop]]s.

Passengers on board the bus are expected to experience a ride comparable to riding in the upper level of a [[double decker bus]]. They will board and alight at stations at the side of the road with platforms at the bus floor height similar to stations of an [[elevated railway]], or via stairs descending through the roof of the bus from a station similar to a [[pedestrian overpass]]. The bus will be electrically powered using [[overhead lines]] or other roof electrical contact systems designed for it, supplemented with [[photovoltaic]] panels, batteries, or [[supercapacitor]]s on board. It will travel at up to {{convert|60|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Different versions will carry up to {{formatnum:1200}} passengers, with the larger versions being articulated to facilitate going around curves.&lt;ref name=chinahush /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT081710/&gt; A working scale model of the now called Transit Explore Bus (TEB) was showcased at the 2016 Beijing International High-Tech Expo.&lt;ref name=Guardian052016&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/china-straddling-floating-bus-beat-traffic-jams?CMP=share_btn_link | title=China unveils 'straddling bus' design to beat traffic jams | first=Tom | last=Phillips | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=26 May 2016 | accessdate= 28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bus would have alarms to warn cars traveling too close to it, and signals to warn other vehicles when it is about to turn. It would have inflatable [[evacuation slide]]s similar to those of an aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gearlive.com.news/article/3d-express-coach-q310/|title=The 3D Express Coach brings new meaning to 'Thru Traffic'|last=Kilhefner|first=John|date=August 6, 2010|publisher=Gear Live|accessdate=August 8, 2010}} {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optional features could include sensors to keep it from colliding with a person or object (such as an overheight vehicle in front), warning lights and safety curtains at the rear to keep drivers of overheight vehicles from going underneath, repeater traffic signals underneath to relay the indications of traffic signals up ahead, and animated light displays to simulate stationary objects to prevent disorientation of drivers underneath.

According to the 2010 proposal, it would cost about 500 million [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] (~{{US$|74.5}} million) to build the bus with a {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[guideway]].  This is claimed to be at 10% of the cost of building an equivalent subway,  and is estimated to reduce traffic congestion by 20–30%. The Chairman of the company has said that it would only take a year for one to be built.&lt;ref name=chinahush/&gt;

At the 2016 unveiling of the Transit Explore Bus (TEB) scale model, Mr. Song claimed each bus will cost about 30 million renminbi, or about {{USD|4.5 million}}, now estimated at one-sixteenth the price of a subway train.&lt;ref name=NYT052016/&gt; According to China’s [[Xinhua News Agency]], the bus can carry 300 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/heres-full-size-working-version-153234100.html |title=Chinese Straddling bus can carry 300 people |last=Limer |first=Eric |date=August 3, 2016 |website=[[Yahoo Tech]] |access-date=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed and actual trials==
The cities of [[Shijiazhuang]], in [[Hebei Province]], and [[Wuhu City|Wuhu]], in [[Anhui Province]], had applied to obtain financing.&lt;ref name=NYT081710/&gt;  A total of {{convert|115|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} of track was set for construction in the [[Mentougou District]] of [[Beijing]] for late 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bosker|first=Bianca|title=China Plans Huge Buses That Can DRIVE OVER Cars (PHOTOS)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/03/china-plans-huge-buses-th_n_669166.html|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial run was cancelled due to doubts about the project.&lt;ref name=NYT052016&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/world/asia/china-elevated-bus.html?emc=eta1&amp;_r=0 | title=Bus Project Finds a Way Around China’s Traffic Jams: Gliding Above Them | first=Emily | last=Feng | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=26 May 2016 | accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Manaus]], [[Brazil]] signed a letter of intent with the Chinese developers to create a straddling bus system.&lt;ref name=Manaus&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alphabet.com/en-ww/article/chinas-straddling-bus|script-title=China's straddling bus|work=Alex Kienlein|date=February 8, 2013|accessdate=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the 2016 unveiling of the scale model, it was reported that a prototype would be deployed by mid-2016 in [[Qinhuangdao]], a coastal city about {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}} east of Beijing.&lt;ref name=Guardian052016/&gt; Song Youzhou, the designer of the bus, said in an interview that other four Chinese cities, Nanyang, [[Shenyang]], [[Tianjin]], and [[Zhoukou]], have also signed contracts with his company for pilot projects involving the construction of hundreds of kilometres of tracks beginning in 2016.&lt;ref name=NYT052016/&gt;

The inaugural test of such a bus was carried out on a {{convert|300|m|abbr=on}} track in the city of Qinhuangdao, [[Hebei]] in August 2016, using the Transit Explore Bus 1 (TEB-1) model which was {{convert|22|m|abbr=on|0}} long, {{convert|7.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|4.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high, with a capacity of 300 passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=China's elevated bus: Futuristic 'straddling bus' hits the road |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-36961433 |date=2016-08-03 |accessdate=2016-08-03 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Straddling Bus Begins Road Tests |url=http://www.seeker.com/straddling-bus-begins-road-tests-1957726070.html |date=2016-08-03 |accessdate=2016-08-04 |publisher=Seeker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=8 Reasons China’s New Traffic-Straddling Bus Is So Fascinating

In August 2016, China's state media ''[[People's Daily Online]]'' labelled the tested Transit Elevated Bus a complete scam, claiming that [[Qinghuangdao]]'s government was unaware of the test.&lt;ref name="PDO201608"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/peoplesdaily/article-3729392/The-elevated-bus-scam-China-blasts-radical-public-transport-amid-safety-concerns-claims-road-test-never-happened.html |title=

China's futuristic "elevated bus" not ready yet |date= August 4, 2016 |accessdate= August 16, 2016 |work= People's Daily Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December 2016, it was reported after the unveiling in August, investors withdrew, and the TEB "has been left in a rusted-out barn — in the middle of a major road".&lt;ref name="TC201612"&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/08/chinas-futuristic-train-that-floats-above-traffic-now-lies-deserted/ "China’s futuristic train that floats above traffic now lies deserted" by John Mannes, TechCrunch, 9 December 2016 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
The Straddling Bus was selected by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the "50 Best Inventions of the Year 2010".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2029497_2030622_2029706,00.html|title=The 50 Best Inventions of 2010: The Straddling Bus|author=Austin Ramzy|work=Time Magazine|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=November 17, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101114075914/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2029497_2030622_2029706,00.html| archivedate=November 14, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversies==
Critics of the project when the concept was unveiled in 2010 have questioned whether the hovering bus could interact safely with other vehicles, particularly when drivers manoeuvre to change lanes. Critics had also argued that the tracks would require relatively straight roads not found in many older urban areas, and that the overhead boarding stations that the bus needed would take up too much space.&lt;ref name=NYT052016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Manaus/&gt;

According to Song Youzhou, the project’s chief engineer, guardrails would be constructed between the bus tracks and the car lanes that pass through the elevated bus to prevent traffic accidents. The rails would be able to absorb at least 70% of a collision’s impact to reduce damage to the bus and other vehicles. Lanes for the elevated bus would be limited to passenger vehicles no higher than {{convert|2.2|m|abbr=on}}, and the buses are designed to meet zoning and bridge height regulations in each city. He also said that the buses were fully capable of turning corners, though the cars underneath must wait until the buses have passed before turning themselves.&lt;ref name=NYT052016/&gt;

In 2016 Mr. Song said to Chinese media that he had arranged to have [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]’s Institute of Automotive Engineering to assess the feasibility of the TEB design. However, the institute’s director denied that he had any involvement with Mr. Song. The institute’s vice director and two professors said in the same report that they had conducted a design analysis, but that it was a personal initiative. Based on their assessment, the professors said, the design was “basically feasible” but “not perfect.”&lt;ref name=NYT052016/&gt; [[Southwest Jiaotong University]] also denied the involvement of technical research and development. "It is true that two researchers from Laboratory of Traction Power had a feasibility meeting with the company", the deputy director of the lab Wang Kaiyun said, "but the comment on it was 'suspicious' (悬)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sohu.com/20160805/n462807053.shtml 西南交大否认系巴铁合作伙伴：评审时就觉得悬] (Chinese) 5 Aug, 2016, retrieved on 5 Aug, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 the track was demolished after Qinghuangdao refused to extend the TEB developer’s land contract which was scheduled to expire in July&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China’s Traffic-Straddling Bus – One Year On|url=https://www.borntoengineer.com/chinas-traffic-straddling-bus-one-year|website=Born to Engineer|accessdate=1 August 2017|language=en|date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In July the bus was removed and police arrested 32 individuals for “illegally raising funds to finance the TEB” after complaints from 72 investors were filed with them&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China’s Traffic-Straddling Bus – One Year On|url=https://www.borntoengineer.com/chinas-traffic-straddling-bus-one-year|website=Born to Engineer|accessdate=1 August 2017|language=en|date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Tsinghua Holdings Corp., Ltd.''' is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Tsinghua University]], itself a public university of China. The company was established as an in-house asset management company for Tsinghua's subsidiaries that were established in 1990s by the [[technology transfer]] of research to business.

==Company officials==
[[Hu Haifeng]] ({{zh|胡海峰}}), son of [[Hu Jintao]], former [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], was appointed in 2009{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} as the [[Party Committee Secretary]] of Tsinghua Holdings, often regarded as the ''de facto'' highest role of the company.

The current Party Committee Secretary of Tsinghua Holdings was [[Long Dawei]] ({{zh|s=龙大伟}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thholding.com.cn/index.php?m=content&amp;c=index&amp;a=lists&amp;catid=79|title=清华控股党委|access-date=7 February 2017|publisher=Tsinghua Holdings|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also served as the vice-chairman. The current chairman was [[Xu Jinghong]] ({{zh|s=徐井宏}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thholding.com.cn/html/about/government/|title=公司治理|access-date=7 February 2017|publisher=Tsinghua Holdings|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rong Yonglin]] ({{zh|s=荣泳霖}}) was the former chairman of the holding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/news/4205/2014/20140901100942747523681/20140901100942747523681_.html 大浪淘尽  唯余清欢——访清华大学原校长助理、清华控股有限公司原董事长荣泳霖] (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tsinghua Holdings was formally formed in 2003 (but tested as a test bed in 2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/gongbao/content/2003/content_62136.htm|title=关于同意北京大学清华大学设立北大资产经营有限公司和清华控股有限责任公司的复函|date=24 April 2003|access-date=7 February 2017|publisher=General Office of the State Council of China|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to the 2001 policy of setting firewall between university and university-owned enterprises;&lt;ref name=academic-entrepreneurship-in-Asia&gt;

In the announcement of the State Council of China in 2001, the plan was aimed to separate ownership and management, which professional business manager would be employed, as well as separation of assets of operating business and non-operating business. The university itself did not invested in other company anymore, but through the holding. The role of the university was supervising the holding via nominating board of directors to supervise it business plan, major investment, salary structure and other roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2012-12/14/content_5832.htm|title=关于北京大学清华大学规范校办企业管理体制试点问题的通知|date=1 November 2001|access-date=7 February 2017|publisher=General Office of the State Council of China|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predecessor of Tsinghua Holdings was incorporated in 26 August 1992 (as {{zh|s=北京清华大学企业集团}}), which the university used an established company to become a new holding company in 2001 for its subsidiaries. According to 2010 Annual Report of Tsinghua Holdings, some assets that non related to its business scope were transferred back to the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shclearing.com/xxpl/fxpl/mtn/201309/t20130927_21415.html 清华控股有限公司2013年度第二期中期票据发行披露材料]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Voyage from Yesteryear''''' is a 1982 [[science fiction]] [[novel]] by British writer [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]].

== Origins ==
According to Hogan, the idea for the book originated around 1976 when he was asked by a friend about whether there was a solution to "[[the Troubles]]" in [[Northern Ireland]]. He said that there was no solution that he could see and that the only thing that might work was separating the children and the adults to prevent the prejudices from being taught at an early age. However, some years later he returned to the concept of a society free from conditioning, which formed part of the basis for ''Voyage from Yesteryear''.&lt;ref name="What Really Brought Down Communism?"&gt;{{cite book

==Plot summary==
The story opens early in the 21st century, as an automated [[space probe]] is being prepared for a mission to explore habitable [[exoplanet]]s in the [[Alpha Centauri]] system. However, [[Earth]] appears destined for a global war which the probe designers fear that humanity may not survive. It appears that the only chance for the human species is to reestablish itself far away from the conflict but there is no time left for a manned expedition to escape Earth. The team, led by Henry B. Congreve, change their mission priority and quickly modify the design to carry several hundred sets of electronically coded human genetic data. Also included in this mission of [[embryo space colonization]] is a databank of human knowledge, robots to convert the data into genetic material and care for the children and construct habitats when the destination is reached, and a number of [[Artificial uterus|artificial wombs]]. The probe's designers name it the ''[[Guanyin|Kuan-Yin]]'' after the [[bodhisattva]] of [[childbirth]] and compassion.

Shortly after the launch, global war indeed breaks out and several decades later, Earthbound humanity is united under an [[authoritarian]] government. It is this government that receives a radio message from the fledgling "[[Chiron]]ian" civilization revealing that the probe found a habitable planet (Chiron) and that the first generation of children have been raised successfully.

As the surviving power blocs of Earth before the conflict are still evident, [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] each send a [[generation ship]] to Alpha Centauri to take control of the colony. By the time that the first generation ship (the American ''Mayflower II'') arrives after 20 years, Chironian society is in its fifth generation.

The ''Mayflower II'' has brought with it thousands of settlers, all the trappings of the authoritarian regime along with [[bureaucracy]], [[religion]], [[fascism]] and a [[military]] presence to keep the population in line. However, the planners behind the generation ship did not anticipate the direction that Chironian society took: in the absence of conditioning and with limitless robotic labor and [[fusion power]], Chiron has become a [[post-scarcity economy]]. Money and material possessions are meaningless to the Chironians and social standing is determined by individual talent, which has resulted in a wealth of art and technology without any hierarchies, central authority or armed conflict.

In an attempt to crush this [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[adhocracy]], the ''Mayflower II'' government employs every available method of control; however, in the absence of conditioning the Chironians are not even capable of comprehending the methods, let alone bowing to them. The Chironians simply use methods similar to [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi's]] ''[[satyagraha]]'' and other forms of [[nonviolent resistance]] to win over most of the ''Mayflower II'' crew members, who had never previously experienced true freedom, and isolate the die-hard authoritarians.

Frustrated with their lack of success, the authoritarian faction stages a military coup on board the ''Mayflower II'' and launches the ship's heavily armed "battle module", threatening to attack unless they submit to a [[military dictatorship]]. Having isolated the authoritarians, the Chironians destroy the module with an [[antimatter]] [[particle beam weapon]]. The remainder of the crew dissolve their government and join Chironian society. The week after, the laser communications beam to the ''Mayflower II'' cuts off, having been destroyed in another global war that had taken place 4.5 years ago.

The epilogue is set five years after these events and shows that the Chironians also assimilated the crews of the Asian and European starships. Now united, the Chironians refit and recommission the ''Mayflower II'' with an advanced antimatter drive and rename it the ''Henry B. Congreve''. The ''Henry B. Congreve'' is sent back to Earth to rebuild human civilization (with the new drive, this journey will only take eight years), fulfilling the ''Kuan-Yin'''s mission of [[Space and survival|preserving humanity]].

==Reception and influences==
Much of the reaction to the novel has been related to the creation of the Chironian society. [[Ken MacLeod]] praised the "attractive and ... plausible depiction of a communist anarchy"&lt;ref name="Ken MacLeod"&gt;{{cite web

Hogan's essay "What Really Brought Down Communism?" explains the reception given to the book in the [[Soviet Union]]. In the mid-80's, Hogan was informed that the novel had been serialized in a [[Poland|Polish]] science fiction magazine, [[Fantastyka]] and, in the absence of a functioning exchange mechanism, paid for it in [[Polish złoty]]s credited to an account taken out in Hogan's name. The story was republished in other Eastern European countries where its depiction of nonviolent resistance against authority proved popular.

In 1989, Hogan attended a convention in [[Kraków]] before travelling to [[Warsaw]] to meet the publishers of the magazine serial and draw out the money he had been paid. However, [[inflation]] following the collapse of the communist regime had reduced the value of the money in the account to just $8.43. Hogan concluded: "So after the [[United States|U.S.]] had spent trillions on its [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]], [[Ohio-class submarine|Trident submarines]], [[National Security Agency|NSA]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and the rest, that was my tab for toppling the Soviet empire. There's always an easy way if you just look."&lt;ref name="What Really Brought Down Communism?"/&gt;
