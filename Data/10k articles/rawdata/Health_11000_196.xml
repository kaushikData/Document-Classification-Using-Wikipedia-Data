The '''2014 Negeri Sembilan and Selangor water crisis''' was a [[water crisis]] that began in the [[Malaysia]]n states of [[Negeri Sembilan]] and [[Selangor]] and lasted from February to August 2014. Its roots can be traced to hot and dry climactic conditions in [[Peninsular Malaysia]] in early 2014, but other factors, including water infrastructure problems and political deadlock in negotiations between the government and private water concessionaires also played central roles. It was the worst water crisis in the state since the [[1998 Klang Valley water crisis]].

==Causes==

===Meteorological background===
Peninsular Malaysia experienced unusually hot and dry weather in early 2014, with a lack of rainfall in key [[Drainage basin|catchment areas]] from which the water supply was sourced.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news|title=Drought forces Malaysia to expand water rationing around Kuala Lumpur|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-28/an-drought-forces-malaysia-to-expand-water-rationing-around-kua/5292466|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early speculations linked the dry weather to the [[El Niño]] effect, but no El Niño emerged in 2014.

===Treatment plant shutdown===
Offline [[Water Treatment|treatment plants]] have been an ongoing problem in Selangor. In February 2014 two plants in the state were shut down due to [[ammonia]] contamination.&lt;ref name=Esquire&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toh|first1=Sumei|title=The Selangor water crisis: a timeline|url=http://www.esquire.my/Entertainment/Features/article/The-Selangor-water-crisis:-a-timeline|website=Esquire|publisher=Esquire Malaysia|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
84% of the Selangor people believe that politics were the main factor responsible for the escalation of water shortages to crisis-level.&lt;ref name=shu&gt;{{cite news|last1=SHUKRY|first1=ANISAH|title=Most Selangor voters believe water shortage due to politics, survey shows|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/most-selangor-voters-believe-water-shortage-due-to-politics-survey-shows|accessdate=7 May 2015|date=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements between [[Syarikat Bekalan Air Selangor]] (SYABAS) and the state government slowed progress toward a stable water supply.  The deadlines for agreement on a water distribution restructuring deal between the government and water concessionaires were postponed several times, while water supply to many households continued to be intermittent.&lt;ref name=Mustafa&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mustafa Kamal|first1=Shazwan|title=No reason to delay state takeover of water firm unless Selangor biased, claims former MB Khalid|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/no-reason-to-delay-state-takeover-of-water-firm-unless-selangor-biased-clai|accessdate=7 May 2015|publisher=Malay Mail Online|date=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

===Negeri Sembilan===
In Negeri Sembilan, the seven [[Reservoir (water)|reservoir]] dams in the state suffered a substantial drop in water level. More than 8,000 homes were affected particularly in the areas of [[Sendayan]], [[Rasah]], [[Mambau]] and [[Seremban]]. On 19 February 2014, Negeri Sembilan Menteri Besar (Chief Minister), [[Mohamad Hassan]] declared a state of crisis following the water shortage – the worst the state has seen in decades.

The announcement had to be made after taps ran dry in several thousand households, due to the unusually long dry spell which has resulted in several water catchment areas drying up.

Natural-disaster relief personnel were dispatched to supply potable water to 8,000 households.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite web|title=Water crisis in Malaysia as drought dries up reservoirs|url=http://www.herald.co.zw/water-crisis-in-malaysia-as-drought-dries-up-reservoirs/|website=The Herald|publisher=The Herald|accessdate=7 May 2015|date=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selangor===

====Immediate====
As river sources dried up, water levels fell to critical levels in seven of the state's dams,&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; including as low as 31% of capacity at the [[Selangor water works|Sungai Selangor Dam]], which supplies more than 60% of the state's water.&lt;ref name=ZAC&gt;{{cite news|last1=ZACHARIAH|first1=ELIZABETH|title=Selangor water crisis caused millions in losses to industries|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/selangor-water-crisis-caused-millions-in-losses-to-industries|accessdate=7 May 2015|agency=The Malaysian Insider|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These critically low reserve levels prompted [[water rationing]] affecting upwards of 6.7 million residents&lt;ref name=Esquire /&gt; and lasting from March to May.&lt;ref name="ZAC"/&gt;
As a result of reduced access to water for commercial use, at least 30 companies in the state, especially in the food and drinks processing, rubber, chemical, electrical and tourism industries, suffered losses greater than [[Malaysian ringgit|MYR]]1 million.&lt;ref name="ZAC"/&gt;

====Long-Term====
In the wake of sustained problems with water infrastructure and supply in Selangor, negotiations are underway to return the four private water concessionaires operating in Selangor to state control.&lt;ref name="ZAC"/&gt;
Construction has been approved of the MYR993.89 million Langat 2 water treatment plant which was proposed to increase the state's output of treated water, alleviate pressure on other treatment plants, and provide an additional safety net in times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water projects flow again in Malaysia|url=http://www.globalwaterintel.com/global-water-intelligence-magazine/archive/15/5/general/water-projects-flow-again-malaysia.html|website=Global Water Intelligence|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5944">The [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) Physician Masterfile includes current and historical data on all [[physician]]s, including AMA members and nonmembers, and graduates of foreign medical schools who reside in the [[United States]] and who have met the educational and credentialing requirements necessary for recognition as physicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/physician-data-resources/physician-masterfile.shtml AMA (Data Resources) AMA Physician Masterfile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A Masterfile record is created and ME number assigned when entering medical school or through the [[ECFMG]].  For medical students, there are two primary methods to create the initial record - the Student Outreach Program and the annual freshman matriculation file received from the [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] (AAMC).

The Physician Masterfile spans from undergraduate medical education through practice and comprise databases of 
* 125 LCME-accredited medical schools
* 7,900 ACGME-accredited graduate medical education programs 
* 1,600 teaching institutions; 820,000 physicians; and 19,000 medical group practices.

Physician records are never removed from the AMA Physician Masterfile, even in the case of a physician's death.

==Student Outreach: steps for record creation==
The Student Outreach Program creates affiliate student records in a database specifically designed to support AMA membership recruitment activities. The record includes:
# student membership application is received
# information is entered into the Student Outreach Database using the student supplied SSN as the initial unique identifier
# SOD data loaded into the AMA Masterfile with status of "unverified"
## student affiliate membership status is assigned
## payment is processed
## record with corresponding ME number is created.  
# primary source notification of enrollment in an LCME-accredited ([[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]]) program received through the AAMC freshman matriculation file. 
# student affiliate records stored in the Masterfile are matched to AAMC records. 
# matched record now contains both an ME number and SSN and has been verified by the primary source.  # affiliate status is removed and a permanent unique record on the Masterfile is established.

"Unverified" affiliate student records are considered and use of the data is limited to providing membership benefits and membership payment processing.

The AMA Masterfile has been in use since 1906.

==Uses==
The data are shared with other organizations and agencies who credential physicians and are used to identify individuals who attempt to fraudulently assume the credentials of deceased physicians.

==United States Medical Students and Physicians==
An AMA Physician Masterfile record is established when individuals enter medical schools accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), or in the case of international medical graduates (IMG), upon entry into ACGME-accredited programs.   When creating a record, the database is first checked to see if the person has a record using  legal last name, legal first name, date of birth, school code, and state of residence to identify unique student entities when creating Masterfile records.

Each AMA Physician Masterfile record includes 
* physician's name
* medical school 
* year of graduation
* gender
* birthplace
* birthdate
* Medical Education (ME) Number (unique identifying id)
* Additional data added from primary data sources or from surveying the physicians directly as the physicians' training and career develop
** residency training
** state licensure
** board certification
** geographical location 
** address
** type of practice
** present employment,
** practice specialty

== International Medical Graduates==
Data on international medical graduates (IMGs) are included in the AMA Physician Masterfile when IMGs enter residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education ([[ACGME]]). The AMA Physician Masterfile also includes data on IMGs who are licensed to practice medicine but who have not entered ACGME-accredited programs and on physicians licensed to practice medicine in the United States but who are temporarily located abroad.

==ME Number==
The [[ME Number]] is created after a student record is created.  Social Security number was used for ME Number {{when?|date=August 2018}} and is widely used by internal AMA processing systems.  The ME number is assigned by the AMA Finance Department.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/475/bot6i06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2018}}

==Controversy==
In July 2007, it was publicized that the AMA discloses Masterfile Physician Data to pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/559704 AMA Discloses Masterfile Physician Data to Pharmaceutical Companies]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, the AMA earned $20 million from the sale of data from the MasterFile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahrp.org/cms/content/view/159/29/ Alliance for Human Research Protection - Some Doctors Object to PhRMA Snooping-NYT_Phil Maher: Pill Popping Nation-LAT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, the AMA brings in over $40 million a year licensing the database.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/04/business/worldbusiness/04iht-Drugs.html U.S. doctors object to data-mining - New York Times (previous citation from International Herald Tribune)]&lt;/ref&gt;
A [https://web.archive.org/web/20070721141528/http://npalliance.org/images/uploads/IssueBrief-Prescribing_Data_low_res.pdf summary] of this issue is available on the [http://www.npalliance.org National Physicians Alliance website].

Bishop]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
The total score is calculated by assessing the following five components on manual [[pelvic examination|vaginal examination]] by a trained professional:

*[[cervix|Cervical]] dilation in centimeters
*[[Cervical effacement]] as a percentage
*Cervical consistency by provider assessment/judgement
*Cervical position
*[[fetus|Fetal]] station, the position of the fetal head in relation to the pelvic bones

The Bishop score grades patients who would be most likely to achieve a successful induction. The duration of labor is inversely correlated with the Bishop score; a score that exceeds 8 describes the patient most likely to achieve a successful vaginal
birth. Bishop scores of less than 6 usually require that a cervical ripening method (pharmacologic or physical, such as a foley bulb) be used before other methods.

They can be remembered with the mnemonic: ''Call PEDS For [[Parturition]]'' = ''C''ervical ''P''osition, ''E''ffacement, ''D''ilation, ''S''oftness; ''F''etal ''S''tation.

==Scoring==
The examiner assigns a score to each component of 0 to 2 or 0 to 3. The highest possible score is 13 and the lowest possible score is 0.

|-
! Cervical position
| align=center| Posterior
| align=center| Middle
| align=center| Anterior
| align=center| –
| The position of the cervix changes with menstrual cycles and also tends to become more anterior (nearer the opening of the vagina) as labour becomes closer. 
|-
!Cervical consistency
| align=center| Firm
| align=center| Medium
| align=center| Soft
| align=center| –
| In [[Primigravida|primigravid]] women, the cervix is typically tougher and resistant to stretching, much like a balloon that has not been previously inflated (it feels like the bottom of a chin). With subsequent vaginal deliveries, the cervix becomes less rigid and allows for easier dilation at term.
|-

| align=center| 0-30%
| align=center| 40-50%
| align=center| 60-70%
| align=center| 80+%
| Effacement translates to how 'thin' the cervix is. The cervix is normally approximately three centimetres long, as it prepares for labour and labour continues the cervix will efface till it is 'fully effaced' (paper-thin).
|-
! [[Cervical dilation]]
| align=center| Closed
| align=center| 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm
| align=center| 3–4&amp;nbsp;cm
| align=center| 5+cm
| Dilation is a measure of how open the cervical os is (the hole). It is usually the most important indicator of progression through the first stage of labour.
|-
! Fetal station
| align=center| −3
| align=center| −2
| align=center| −1, 0
| align=center| +1, +2
| Fetal station describes the position of the fetus's head in relation to the distance from the [[ischial spine]]s, which are approximately 3-4 centimetres inside the vagina and are not usually felt. Health professionals visualise where these spines are and use them as a reference point.  Negative numbers indicate that the head is further inside than the ischial spines and positive numbers show that the head is below the level of the ischial spines.

==Interpretation==
{{confusing section|date=July 2018}}
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2018}}
{{clarify span|A score of 5 or less suggests that labour is unlikely to start without induction. A score of 9 or more indicates that labour will most likely commence spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tenore J |title=Methods for cervical ripening and induction of labor |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=67 |issue=10 |pages=2123–8 |year=2003 |pmid=12776961}} [http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030515/2123.html (Incomplete) Free Text].&lt;/ref&gt; Scores between 5 and 9 require additional consideration and professional judgement for clinical management.|date=July 2018}}

A Bishop's score 6 or less often indicates that induction (e.g., with controlled-release prostaglandin E2/prostin gel [Cervidil], intravaginal gel [Prostin], intracervical gel [Prepidil]) is unlikely to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2381313 Cat.Inist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources indicate that only a score of 8 or greater is reliably predictive of a successful induction.

==Modified Bishop score==
According to the Modified Bishop's pre-induction cervical scoring system, effacement has been replaced by cervical length in cm, with scores as follows: 0 for &gt;3&amp;nbsp;cm, 1 for &gt;2&amp;nbsp;cm, 2 for &gt;1&amp;nbsp;cm, 3 for &gt;0&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Dutta DC. Text Book of Obstetrics. 6ed. New Central Book Agency. 2001. {{ISBN|978-81-7381-142-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cervical length may be easier and more accurate to measure and have less inter-examiner variability.

&lt;!-- need to confirm the above is as Bishop defined it -- with print version of AAFP article or Bishop's article -- http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030515/2123.pdf --&gt;
Another modification for the Bishop's score is the modifiers. Points are added or subtracted according to special circumstances as follows:
* One point is added to the total score for:
** 1. Existence of [[pre-eclampsia]]
** 2. Each previous vaginal delivery
* One point is subtracted from the total score for:
** 1. Postdate/post-term pregnancy
** 2. Nulliparity (no previous vaginal deliveries)
** 3. PPROM; [[Premature rupture of membranes|preterm premature (prelabor) rupture of membranes]]

'''CHARGE syndrome''' (formerly known as '''CHARGE association''') is a rare [[syndrome]] caused by a [[genetic disorder]]. First described in 1979, the [[acronym]] "CHARGE" came into use for newborn children with the congenital features of [[coloboma]] of the eye, heart defects, [[atresia]] of the nasal [[choanae]], retardation of growth and/or development, [[genital]] and/or urinary abnormalities, and ear abnormalities and deafness.&lt;ref name="Pagon"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pagon RA, Graham JM, Zonana J, Yong SL |title=Coloboma, congenital heart disease, and choanal atresia with multiple anomalies: CHARGE association |journal=J. Pediatr. |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=223–7 |year=1981 |pmid=6166737 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(81)80454-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features are no longer used in making a diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome, but the name remains. About two thirds of cases are due to a [[CHD7]] mutation. CHARGE syndrome occurs only in 0.1–1.2 per 10,000 live births; as of 2009 it was the leading cause of congenital [[deafblindness]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaldb.org/documents/products/2008-Census-Tables.pdf  The 2008 National Child Count of Children and Youth who are Deaf-Blind], The National Consortium on Deaf-Blindness, 2009|pages=30|page=&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
CHARGE syndrome was formerly referred to as CHARGE association, which indicates a non-random pattern of congenital anomalies that occurs together more frequently than one would expect on the basis of chance. Very few people with CHARGE will have 100% of its known features. In 2004, mutations on the [[CHD7]] gene (located on [[Chromosome 8]]) were found in 10 of 17 patients in the Netherlands, making CHARGE an official syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Vissers, L. E. | author2=van Ravenswaaij, C. M. | author3=Admiraal, R. | author4=Hurst, J. A. | author5=de Vries, B. B. | author6=Janssen, I. M. | title=Mutations in a new member of the chromodomain gene family cause CHARGE syndrome. | journal=Nature Genetics | year=2004 | pages=955–957  | volume=36 | doi=10.1038/ng1407 | pmid=15300250 | issue=9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A US study of 110 individuals with CHARGE syndrome showed that 60% of those tested had a mutation of the CHD7 gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalani SR, Safiullah AM, Fernbach SD |title=Spectrum of CHD7 Mutations in 110 Individuals with CHARGE Syndrome and Genotype-Phenotype Correlation |journal=Am.

In 2010, a review of 379 clinically diagnosed cases of CHARGE syndrome, in which [[CHD7]] mutation testing was undertaken found that 67% of cases were due to a [[CHD7]] mutation.&lt;ref name="pmid20186815"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zentner GE, Layman WS, Martin DM, Scacheri PC | title=Molecular and phenotypic aspects of CHD7 mutation in CHARGE syndrome | journal=[[Am J Med Genet A]] | year=2010 | volume=152 | issue=3 | pages=674–686 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.33323 | pmid=20186815 | pmc=2918278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CHD7 is a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) protein family that plays a role in transcription regulation by chromatin remodeling.&lt;ref name="pmid22461308"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janssen|first=N |author2=Bergman, JE |author3=Swertz, MA |author4=Tranebjaerg, L |author5=Lodahl, M |author6=Schoots, J |author7=Hofstra, RM |author8=van Ravenswaaij-Arts, CM |author9=Hoefsloot, LH |title=Mutation update on the CHD7 gene involved in CHARGE syndrome.|journal=Human Mutation|date=August 2012|volume=33|issue=8|pages=1149–1160|doi=10.1002/humu.22086|pmid=22461308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
The diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome is often difficult, because it is rare. The syndrome spans many disciplines, and as such, can be diagnosed by a pediatrician, [[oral and maxillofacial surgeon]], ENT specialist, ophthalmologist, endocrinologist, cardiologist, urologist, developmental specialist, radiologist, geneticist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, or orthopedic specialist.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Signs===
Although [[genetic test]]ing positively identifies nearly two thirds of children with CHARGE syndrome, diagnosis is still largely clinical.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The following signs were originally identified in children with this syndrome, but are no longer used in to make the diagnosis alone.

* '''C''' - [[Coloboma]] of the [[human eye|eye]], [[central nervous system]] anomalies
* '''H''' - [[Heart defects]]
* '''A''' - [[Choanal atresia|Atresia of the choanae]]
* '''R''' - Retardation of growth and/or development
* '''G''' - Genital and/or urinary defects ([[Hypogonadism]], [[cryptorchidism|undescended testicles]], besides [[hypospadias]].)
* '''E''' - Ear anomalies and/or [[deafness]] and abnormally bowl-shaped and concave ears, known as "lop ears".

===Genetic testing===
Genetic testing for CHARGE syndrome involves specific genetic testing for the CHD7 gene. The test is available{{when|date=July 2016}} at most major genetic testing laboratories. Insurance companies sometimes do not pay for such genetic tests, though this is changing rapidly as genetic testing is becoming standard across all aspects of medicine. CHARGE syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, which means genetic testing is not required in order to make the diagnosis. Rather, the diagnosis can be made based on clinical features alone.

===Screening other organ systems===
Once the diagnosis is made based on clinical signs, it is important to investigate other body systems that may be involved. For example, if the diagnosis is made based on the abnormal appearance of the ears and developmental delay, it is important to check the child's hearing, vision, heart, nose, and urogenital system. Ideally, every child newly diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome should have a complete evaluation by an ENT specialist, audiologist, ophthalmologist, pediatric cardiologist, developmental therapist, and pediatric urologist.

==Therapy and outcome==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Children with CHARGE syndrome may have a number of life-threatening medical conditions; with advances in medical care, these children can survive and can thrive with the support of a multidisciplinary team of medical professionals. Therapies and education must take into consideration hearing impairment, vision problems, and any others. Early intervention, such as occupational, speech-language, and physical therapy, to improve static posture, ambulation, and self-care skills is important. The intelligence of children with multiple health impairments, such as combined [[deafblindness]], can be underestimated in the absence of early intervention.

===Education===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Children with CHARGE syndrome will vary greatly in their abilities in the classroom: some may need little support, while some may require full-time support and individualized programs.
Taking each of the various affected body systems into account is vital to the success of the child in the educational setting.
An important step in dealing with abnormal behavior is understanding why it is occurring and helping the child learn more appropriate methods of communicating. Before a child reaches age 18 (or the age of maturity in their country) doctors and specialists need to be found that will follow the individual in adulthood.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence is estimated to range from 0.1–1.2 per 10,000 live births, though the true incidence is unknown.&lt;ref name="pmid16959034"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blake|first=KD|author2=Prasad, C|title=CHARGE syndrome.|journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|date=Sep 7, 2006|volume=1|pages=34|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-1-34|pmid=16959034|pmc=1586184}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, the highest prevalence was found in Canada and estimated at 1 in 8,500 live births.&lt;ref name="pmid15637722"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Issekutz|first=KA |author2=Graham JM Jr |author3=Prasad, C |author4=Smith, IM |author5=Blake, KD |title=An epidemiological analysis of CHARGE syndrome: preliminary results from a Canadian study.|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A|date=Mar 15, 2005|volume=133A|issue=3|pages=309–17|pmid=15637722|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.30560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
Dr. B.D. Hall first described the CHARGE association in a 1979 journal paper of about 17 children who had been born with [[choanal atresia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hall BD |title=Choanal atresia and associated multiple anomalies |journal=J. Pediatr. |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=395–8 |year=1979 |pmid=469662 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(79)80513-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, Dr. H.M. Hittner described 10 children who had choanal atresia as well as coloboma, congenital heart defect, and hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hittner HM, Hirsch NJ, Kreh GM, Rudolph AJ |title=Colobomatous microphthalmia, heart disease, hearing loss, and mental retardation--a syndrome |journal=Journal of pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=122–8 |year=1979 |pmid=458518 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using both coloboma or choanal atresia and some of the other related characteristic malformations, Dr. R. A. Pagon first coined the acronym CHARGE in 1981 to emphasize that this cluster of associated malformations occurred together.&lt;ref name="Pagon" /&gt; 
It came to be recognised{{when|date=July 2016}} as a syndrome within the umbrella of the CHARGE association, a set of apparently random signs occurring together. Since the signs seen in CHARGE are caused by a genetic anomaly, its name was eventually{{when|date=July 2016}} changed to 'CHARGE syndrome'.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board known as CMWSSB provides Water supply and sewage treatment to the city of [[Chennai]] and areas around it.

'''[[Chennai]]''' is one of the metros in [[India]] which is dependent mostly on ground water supply. Ground water in Chennai is replenished by rain water and average rainfall in Chennai is  1276&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/bline/2003/09/15/stories/2003091500010900.htm The Hindu Business Line : Desalination: Answer to Chennai's water woes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Chennai receives about 985 million liters per day (mld) from various sources against the required amount of 1200 mld and the demand is expected to rise to 2100 mld by 2031.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The newly constructed Minjur desalination plant adds another 100 mlds to the city's growing demand.

As of 2012, Chennai Metrowater supplies about 830 million litres of water every day to residents and commercial establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

== History of Sewerage Construction and development ==
Till about the mid of 19th century, Chennai received water from local shallow wells and tanks. Mr. Fraser, a civil engineer who visited Madras, forwarded a proposal to the government to tap the Kortalayar river which is situated about 160&amp;nbsp;km northwest of Chennai and it was accepted. The project consisted of a masonry weir across Kortalayar at Tamarapakkam and diverted the water into Cholavaram lake and hence into the Red Hills lake through a channel. The works were completed in 1870 at a cost of about Rs.18.50 lakhs. In 1872, a Valve House at Red Hills and an earthen supply channel to supply water to Chennai by gravitation was constructed. In early 1890, surface drains in the City were connected to Pumping Stations and the wastewater conveyed for disposal away from inhabitation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chennaimetrowater.tn.nic.in/historical_background.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorities observed an increase in population in the beginning of the 20th century. Hence, they decided to develop a comprehensive drainage scheme. The proposal for this scheme to cater to the needs of a topographically flat, fast growing city was formulated in 1907 and works were initiated in 1910 and completed during 1914 in stages. The systems were designed for the population of 6.5 lakhs expected in 1961 at 114 lit. per capita per day of water supply. The system originally consisted of a network of force mains and brick gravity sewers served by 3 Pumping Stations at Royapuram, Purasaiwalkam and Napier Park and ultimately discharging wastewater into the sea at Kasimedu on the Northeastern boundary of the City. A fundamental change to this system was made in 1956 by laying a force main to divert part of the sewage discharged from the Purasaiwalkam Pumping Station to Kodungaiyur where the sewage farm was established. The aim of this diversion was to utilise the sewage for irrigation and fertilising agricultural land. But one of the implied benefit of this was the conservation of fresh water whose supply was scarce. Thereafter a comprehensive wastewater management scheme was formulated. The implementation of these schemes commenced in 1961 and had undergone modifications periodically commensurate with the system requirements of an expanding City and the growing population. The wastewater system for the City has been divided into five drainage zones. These zones of macro systems covering the entire City had independent zonal collections, conveyance, treatment and disposal facilities.

Zone-1 covers the areas of Tondaiarpet, Washermenpet, Royapuram, George Town and Chindadripet. Zone-2 comprises areas such as Nungambakkam, Chetpet, Kilpauk, Egmore, Purasaiwalkam, Ayanavaram, Perambur, Vyasarpadi, Sembium, Kolathur, Periyar Nagar, Jawahar Nagar and Kodungaiyur. It is the largest of all zones. Zone–III lies between Zone–II and Zone–IV to the West. It comprises Thyagaraya Nagar, Kodambakkam, Arumbakkam, Anna Nagar and Koyambedu. The areas covered by Zone-4 are Ashok Nagar, Saidapet, Jafferkhanpet, K.K. Nagar and Nesapakkam. Zone–V is the second largest of the five macro systems and is to the South of the City which is bifurcated by the Adyar River. Areas covered are Ice House, Mylapore, Adyar, Guindy, Velacherry, Gandhi Nagar and Indra Nagar.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.chennaimetrowater.tn.nic.in/seweragesystem.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, considerable amount of efforts were made by the government to ensure the administration and development of a proper wastewater system in Chennai.

==Reservoirs==
Chennai has fresh water reservoirs/lakes namely [[Poondi]], [[Sholavaram]], [[Red Hills Lake|Red Hills]], [[Chembarambakkam]] and [[Veeranam]]  cater the daily needs of water for people of Chennai.

Chennai receives most of its water from [[Poondi Lake]] (3,231 Mcft), [[Sholavaram Lake]] (881 Mcft), [[Red Hills Lake]] (3,300 Mcft) and [[Chembarambakkam Lake]] (3,645 Mcft).

The Veeranam Water Supply Project was implemented as an additional source of water to Chennai City.  The Project was commissioned in the year 2004 to supply 180 MLD of water to Chennai City by drawing water from [[Veeranam Lake]].  This lake receives water from [[Cauvery River]] system through Kollidam, [[Lower Anicut]] and Vadavar Canal besides rainwater from its own catchment area.  The capacity of the lake is 1465 mcft.  The lake water is treated at Vadakuthu Water Treatment Plant by pumping raw water at a distance of 20&amp;nbsp;km. from Sethiathope to Vadakuthu through a 1775&amp;nbsp;mm dia mild steel pipe.  The treated water is then pumped at a distance of 8&amp;nbsp;km. to Break Pressure Tank at Kadampuliyur through a 1750&amp;nbsp;mm dia mild steel pipe and from there the water is carried to a distance of about 200&amp;nbsp;km. Through the mild steel pipe of 1875&amp;nbsp;mm and 1500&amp;nbsp;mm dia by gravity to Porur Water Distribution Station near Chennai.  From this Distribution Station, water is pumped to a distance of 1.2&amp;nbsp;km. and distributed to Chennai City through Trunk mains and Water Distribution stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chennaimetrowater.tn.nic.in/about/aboutusmain.htm Chennai metro water] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121071846/http://www.chennaimetrowater.tn.nic.in/about/aboutusmain.htm |date=21 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse Osmosis &amp; Desalination==
Chennai has Reverse osmosis plants namely at [[Velachery]], Nochikuppam, Kasimedu, and Ayodhyakuppam. It takes raw Brackish water from bore wells, store in tanks and then purifies it before supply.

Desalination plant is located at Kattupalli, [[Minjur]]. The [[Chennai Water Desalination Ltd.]] ([[CWDL]]) is setting the plant infrastructure and maintaining the plant for 25 years as per agreement between [[CWDL]] and CMWSSB. The CMWSSB purchase water from them and supplies to the city network through [[Madhavaram]] Booster Station.&lt;ref&gt;[[Minjur Seawater Desalination Plant]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to alleviate the woes of Chennaiites, [[Tamil Nadu]] Government has forged into projects acquiring fresh water by desalinating sea water. The first such desalination plant was built in {{convert|60|acre|m2}} in Kattupalli village near [[Minjur]] about 35&amp;nbsp;km north of Chennai. Minjur desalination plant which supplies 100 million litres a day water to [[Chennai]] city was inaugurated on 31 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/Minjur-desalination-plant-inauguration-today/article16215721.ece | title=Minjur desalination plant inauguration today | date=31 July 2010 | newspaper=The Hindu | accessdate=6 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second [[water desalination]] plant of 100mld capacity constructed and commissioned at Nemmeli, South of Chennai City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chennaidesal.info/ Chennai water desalination] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002131242/http://www.chennaidesal.info/ |date=2 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides two new Sea Water Reverse Osmosis Plants (SWRO) are proposed of 150mld (funded under KFW) at Nemmeli and 400mld (funded under JICA) at Perur are proposed for catering to Chennai Water Supply.(Reference: Municipal Administration and Water Supply department of Government of Tamil Nadu, Policy Note 2015 -2016)

The Water Treatment Plants are:
*Kilpauk Water Treatment Plant: 270 MLD
*Puzhal Water Treatment Plant: 300 MLD
*Vadakuthu Water Treatment Plant (Veeranam Lake source): 180 MLD
*Chembarambakkam Water Treatment Plant: 530 MLD

==Sewerage==
Chennai City Sewerage System was designed in 1910 for an estimated 1961 population of 6.6 lakhs. A comprehensive improvement to the city sewage system was designed in 1958 for an estimated 1976 population of 25.5 lakhs and 1991 population of 27.2 lakhs at a sewage flow rate of 110 lpcd in 1976 and 180 lpcd in 1991; the city was also divided into five zones with proposals for five independent disposal works. It was planned to isolate the system of collection, transmission and disposal of sewage in each zone in order to obviate the difficulties of the relay system. Presently the sewerage network in Chennai city has covered 98% of its area. As the capacity of sewers was limited, during rainy days they became surcharged due to ingress of storm water. Any surplus of sewage in excess of pumping stations capacity was drained into the nearby natural water courses of the city viz. Cooum river, Adyar river, Buckingham canal and Otteri Nalla.
The following are the Sewage Treatment Plants of CMWSSB as of February 2016
1)Kodungaiyur 270mld (110+80+80), 2)Villivakkam 5mld 3)Koyambedu 214mld (34+60+120)4)Nesapakkam 117mld (23+40+54) and 5)Perungudi including Alandur and considering BOD and SS load 163mld {79 (instead of installed 54)+72 (instead of installed 60)+12)totalling to 769 mld (million litres per day)in 13 units of which 535mld is powered by Biogas (produced during the Sewage Treatment)engines.( Reference: Municipal Administration and Water Supply Department of Government of Tamil Nadu Policy Note 2015-2016, page 223).Besides two sewage treatment plants are under construction at Thiruvatriyur (31mld) and Sholinganallur (18mld).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chennaimetrowater.tn.nic.in/seweragesystem.html|title=Welcome to Chennai Metro Water|website=www.chennaimetrowater.tn.nic.in|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rain Water Harvesting==
The importance of conservation of water and rainwater harvesting can not be understated. While issuing Planning Permission for construction of major developments such as flats, residential developments, office, shopping and other commercial complexes, the condition to provide rain water-harvesting structures within the premises was put and ensured to be provided before issue of Completion Certificates. Provision of rainwater structures in all types of developments, irrespective of size or use was made mandatory by amending DCR and Buildingg Byelaws in the year 2001, not only for the buildings proposed to be constructed but also for all the existing buildings.
After implementation of this scheme widely in CMA, a significant increase in the ground water levels and also quality of ground water was noted.

== Contamination ==
The water quality in Chennai is a long way to reach International standards as outlined in this study published on April 2007. [[Researcher]]s from [[National Environmental Engineering Research Institute]], Chennai Zonal Laboratory, Chennai found [[Cryptosporidium]] [[oocytes]] in Chennai water. Cryptosporidium is an [[intestine|enteric]] [[parasitic]] [[protozoa]]n capable of causing [[diarrhea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/114211007/abstract Contamination]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
As of 2011, MetroWater is catering for a population of 5 million. With the expansion of the corporation area in 2011 from 174&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;km to 426&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;km, which increased the number of wards of the Chennai Corporation from 155 to 200 and the number of zones from 10 to 15, MetroWater's customer base is expected to increase by an additional 1.7 million when the new areas are covered. The number of area offices of MetroWater would also be changed to correspond with the Corporation's zones. While the existing 155 depot offices of MetroWater would be reduced to 107, 93 new depot offices would be added from merged areas. At present, each depot office serves a population of about 50,000. Since two or three wards have been merged into one, the coverage of the depot office would increase by 20,000. There are also proposals to construct sewage treatment plants in [[Mangadu]] and [[Villivakkam]] as part of the plans to build new infrastructure for the newly merged areas.&lt;ref name="Hindu_MetroWaterToFathomNeeds"&gt;{{Cite news

== Environment protection ==
The Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewage Board Board has shown its concern for environment through its sewage treatment process. In this process, bio-gas is produced and is being used to produce power to run the plants. This incidentally reduces the discharge of Green House Gas into the atmosphere and provides for Carbon Trading. CMWSS Board has adopted Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) which leads to savings in energy cost to a turn of Rs.43.05 lakhs per month.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Also, more consideration needs to be taken when a child fractures a bone since it will affect the child in his or her growth.&lt;ref name="orthopedics.about.com"&gt;Broken Bones in Children

== How fractures occur ==

On an everyday basis bones will support many kinds of forces naturally applied to them, but when the forces are too strong the bones will break. For example, when an adolescent jumps off of a [[trampoline]] and lands on his/her feet the bones and connective tissue in the adolescent’s feet will usually absorb the force, flex, then return to their original shape. However, if the adolescent lands and the force is too strong, the bones and the connective tissue will not be able to support the force and will fracture.&lt;ref  name="treat"&gt;What Is a Bone Fracture and How Is it Treated? www.kidsgrowth.com. Oct. 24, 2008. Retrieved Oct. 2008 &lt; http://www.kidsgrowth.com/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=1504&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between child and adult bones ==
[[File:Healing of fractured bone.jpg|thumb|An illustration showing the stages of healing of fractured bone.]]
There are differences in the bone structure of a child and an adult. These differences are important for the correct evaluation and treatment of the fractures. A child’s bones heal faster than an adult’s because a thicker, stronger, and more active dense fibrous membrane ([[periosteum]]) covers the surface of their bones.&lt;ref name="Staheli, Lynn p. 258"&gt;Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; The periosteum has blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrition to the bone cells. The stronger and thicker periosteum in children causes a better supply of oxygen and nutrients to the bones,&lt;ref&gt;Hilt, Nancy E, Pediatric Orthopedic Nursing p. 12.

&lt;/ref&gt; and this helps in the remodeling of the fractured bones by supplying. The periosteum in children causes a more rapid union of fractured bones and an increased potential for remodeling.&lt;ref name="Staheli, Lynn p. 258" /&gt; A child’s fractures not only heal more quickly, but are significantly reduced due to the thickness and strength of a child’s periosteum. But this thickness also has its drawbacks; when there is a small displacement in the periosteum the thickness and strength of it will make the fracture in the periosteum difficult to diagnose.&lt;ref name="Staheli, Lynn p. 258"/&gt;

=== Growth plate ===
[[Growth plates]] are the areas in bones where the bones grow.&lt;ref&gt;Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; In children the growth plates are open, which helps to manage a child’s fractures.

=== Age and sex related fractures ===
Bone fracture types differ depending on the age and sex of the child. The changes in the bones over time cause variance in the pattern and number of bone fracture injuries. The probability of bone fractures in children increases with age.&lt;ref name="Staheli"&gt;Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; For a small child, injuries will most likely be minimal because the child doesn’t have the speed or mass to cause serious injuries.&lt;ref name="Staheli" /&gt; When age increases, so does mass and speed resulting in more serious fractures. The age when girls usually fracture a bone is twelve and for boys the age is fourteen.&lt;ref name="Staheli" /&gt; Also, girls statistically have fewer fractures than boys.  About half of boys and one-fourth of girls are likely to have a fracture during childhood. The [[wrist]] is also the most likely part of the body to be injured. As sport activities increase, the fractures in children increase as well, especially for boys who participate in either [[wrestling]] or [[football]]. Much like bone types in the different stages of childhood are varying, so the bone fracture injuries in infants, children, and adolescents vary. Careful evaluation for the best treatment of each child is needed.&lt;ref name="Staheli" /&gt;

== Different types of fractures ==

The bones of a child are more likely to bend than to break completely because they are softer and the periosteum is stronger and thicker.&lt;ref name="orthopedics.about.com"/&gt; The fractures that are most common in children are the incomplete fractures; these fractures are the greenstick and torus or buckle fractures.

=== Greenstick fracture ===
This fracture involves a bend on one side of the bone and a partial fracture on the other side. The name is by analogy with green (i.e., fresh) wood which similarly breaks on the outside when bent. The Sub-nanostructure of cortical bone may provide one possible explanation for the greenstick fractures in children. On the contrary to adults bone tissue, the low ratio between the mature and the immature enzymatic cross-links in children bone tissue is a potential explanation of the presence of greenstick fractures in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Torus or buckle fracture ===
This fracture occurs at the metaphyseal locations and resemble the torus or base of a pillar in architectural terms. Acute angulation of the cortex is noted, as opposed to the usual curved surface.

== The less common fractures (complete fractures) are ==
[[File:Types of fracture.jpg|thumb|An illustration showing types of fracture.]]
=== Closed fracture ===
A fracture that doesn’t penetrate the [[skin]].
=== Open (compound) fracture ===
A fracture resulting in the ends of a bone penetrating the skin (these pose an increased risk of infection).
=== Non-displaced fracture === 
A fracture where the bone cracks completely and the pieces line up.
=== Displaced fracture ===
A fracture where the bone cracks completely in two or more pieces, and the pieces move out of alignment (this type of fracture might require [[surgery]] to make sure the pieces are aligned before casting).

== Other common fractures  ==

=== Hairline fracture ===
An incomplete fracture (a thin crack in the bone that doesn’t go all the way through the bone.)

=== Single fracture ===
The bone is fractured only in one place.

=== Segmental fracture ===
Fracture in two or more places in the same bone.

=== Comminuted fracture ===
The bone fractures in more than two places or is crushed into pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Broken Bones, kidshealth.org, Reviewed by: Peter G. Gabos, MD Date reviewed: April 2008. Retrieved Sep. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corner or bucket-handle fracture===
A ''corner fracture'' or ''bucket-handle fracture'' is fragmentation of the distal end of one or both [[femur]]s, with the loose piece appearing at the bone margins as an osseous density paralleling the metaphysis.&lt;ref name=McGraw-Hill2002&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/bucket+handle+fracture thefreedictionary.com &gt; bucket handle fracture] citing: McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine.  2002&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''bucket-handle fracture'' is used where the loose bone is rather wide at the distal end, making it end in a crescent shape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/medicine/pediatrics/pemxray/v4c02.html Bucket Handle and Corner Fractures] Radiology Cases in Pediatric Emergency Medicine. Volume 4, Case 2. Rodney B. Boychuk, M.D. Kapiolani Medical Center For Women And Children. University of Hawaii. John A. Burns School of Medicine&lt;/ref&gt; These types of fractures are characteristic of [[child abuse]]-related injuries.&lt;ref name=agabegi2nd82&gt;Page 82 in: {{cite book |author1=Elizabeth D Agabegi |author2=Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7153-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms of a bone fracture ==

Even though symptoms vary widely after experiencing a bone fracture, the most common fracture symptoms include:
*[[pain]] in the fractured area
*[[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] in the fractured area
*obvious [[deformity]] in the fractured area
*not being able to use or move the fractured area in a normal manner
*[[bruising]], warmth, or redness in the fractured area&lt;ref name="treat" /&gt;

== Children with a higher risk of a fracture ==

=== Low bone mineral content ===
Children with generalized [[Disorder (medicine)|disorder]]s such as [[renal disease]]s, [[cystic fibrosis]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[growth hormone deficiency]], and [[osteogenesis imperfecta]] disorders are at risk.&lt;ref name="Staheli p274"&gt;Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;
Neuromuscular disorders: children with cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and arthrogryposis, have a higher risk of a fracture because of the combination of joint stiffness and poor mineralization.&lt;ref name="Staheli p274" /&gt;

=== Fracture personality ===
Children in general are at greater risk because of their high activity levels. Children that have risk-prone behaviors are at even greater risk.&lt;ref name="Staheli p274" /&gt;

== Child abuse ==
Over 2.5 million [[child abuse]] and [[child neglect|neglect]] cases are reported every year, and thirty-five out of every hundred cases are physical abuse cases.&lt;ref name="Staheli p272"&gt;Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Bone fractures are sometimes part of the [[physical abuse]] of children; knowing the symptoms of bone fractures in physical abuse and recognizing the actual risks in physical abuse will help forward the prevention of future abuse and injuries.&lt;ref name="Staheli p272" /&gt; Astoundingly, these [[abuse]] fractures, if not dealt with correctly, have a potential to lead to the death of the child.&lt;ref name="Staheli p272" /&gt;
Fracture patterns in abuse fractures that are very common with abuse are fractures in the growing part of a long bone (between the shaft and the separated part of the bone), fractures of the humeral shaft (long bone between the [[shoulder]] and [[elbow]]), [[ribs]], [[scapula]], outer end of the [[clavicle]], and [[vertebra]]. Multiple fractures of varying age, bilateral fractures, and complex [[skull fracture]]s are also linked to abuse. Fractures of varying ages occur in about thirteen percent of all cases.&lt;ref name="Staheli p272" /&gt;

== Treatment ==

When a child experiences a fracture, he or she will have pain and will not be able to easily move the fractured area.&lt;ref name="treat" /&gt; A [[physician|doctor]] or [[emergency care]] should be contacted immediately. In some cases even though the child will not have pain and will still be able to move, medical help must be sought out immediately.&lt;ref name="treat" /&gt; To decrease the pain, bleeding, and movement a physician will put a [[splint (medicine)|splint]] on the fractured area. Treatment for a fracture follows a simple rule: the bones have to be aligned correctly and prevented from moving out of place until the bones are healed.&lt;ref name="treat" /&gt; The specific treatment applied depends on how severe the fracture is, if it’s an open or closed fracture, and the specific bone involved in the fracture (a hip fracture is treated differently from a forearm fracture for example)&lt;ref name="treat" /&gt;
Different treatments for different fractures:&lt;ref name="treat" /&gt;	
The general treatments for common fractures are as follows:

=== Cast immobilization ===
Because most fractures heal successfully after having been repositioned, a simple plaster or fiberglass [[Orthopedic cast|cast]] is commonly used.&lt;ref name="treat" /&gt;

=== Functional cast or brace ===
A cast, or brace, that allows limited movement of the nearby [[joint]]s is acceptable for some fractures.&lt;ref name="treat" /&gt;

=== Traction ===
This treatment consists of aligning a bone or bones by a gentle, steady pulling action. The pulling may be transmitted to the bone or bones by a metal pin through a bone or by skin tapes. This is a preliminary treatment used in preparation for other secondary treatments.&lt;ref name="treat" /&gt;

=== Open reduction and internal fixation ===
This treatment is only used when an orthopedic surgeon assigns it to restore the fractured bone to its original function. This method positions the bones to their exact location, but there is a risk for infection and other complications. The procedure involves the orthopedist performing surgery on the bone to align the bone fragments, followed by the placement of special screws or metal plates to the outer surface of the bone. The fragments can also be held together by running metal rods through the [[Bone marrow|marrow]] in the center of the bone.&lt;ref name="treat" /&gt;

=== External fixation ===
This treatment also requires surgery by an [[orthopedist]]. Pins or screws are placed into the fractured bone above and below the fracture site. The [[orthopedic surgeon]] repositions the bone fragments and pins or screws are connected to a metal bar or bars outside the skin which holds the bones in their proper position so they can heal. The external fixation device is removed after an appropriate time period.&lt;ref name="treat" /&gt;

===Medication ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2009">The '''China Kadoorie Biobank'''  is acquiring genomic data on half a million Chinese participants.

It collected questionnaire and physical data and blood samples on 510,000 men and women aged between 30 and 79 from 10 regions in China between 2004-2008 with the aim of investigating chronic diseases (e.g. heart attack, stroke, diabetes, and cancer). Participants have been linked to mortality registers and nationwide health systems and a sub-group of 25,000 are retested every few years. It is a joint venture by the University of Oxford’s [[Clinical Trial Service Unit]] &amp; Epidemiological Studies Unit and the [[Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences]]. &lt;ref&gt;(2014) [http://www.ckbiobank.org/site/ China Kadoorie Biobank] University of Oxford, Retrieved 28 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Research based on the biobank published by the [[American Thoracic Society]] in 2018 found that respiratory disease hospitalization or death were 36% higher among people who used wood or coal for cooking compared to those who used electricity or gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cooking with wood or coal is linked to increased risk of respiratory illness and death |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/09/180921092447.htm |accessdate=1 October 2018 |publisher=Science Daily |date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in [[Heart (journal)|Heart]] based on the biobank found that people who ate an egg a day had a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease overall than those who ate no eggs. They had a 25% lower incidence of [[hemorrhagic stroke]], and a 12% reduction in risk of [[ischemic heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Recent studies show the benefits of eating eggs |url=https://www.dailyherald.com/entlife/20180825/recent-studies-show-the-benefits-of-eating-eggs |accessdate=1 October 2018 |publisher=Daily Herald |date=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2168">A '''citizen survey''' is a kind of [[opinion poll]] which typically asks the residents of a specific [[jurisdiction]] for their perspectives on local issues, such as the [[quality of life]] in the community, their level of satisfaction with [[local government]], or their [[politics|political leanings]]. Such a survey can be conducted by mail, telephone, [[World Wide Web|Internet]], or in person.

Citizen surveys were advanced by Harry Hatry&lt;ref&gt;Selected Research - http://www.urban.org/expert.cfm?ID=HarryPHatry&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Urban Institute]], who believed resident opinions to be as necessary to the actions of local government managers and elected officials as customer surveys are to [[executive officer|business executive]]s. Local government officials use the data from citizen surveys to assist them in [[resource allocation|allocating resources]] for maximum community benefit and forming [[strategic planning|strategic plans]] for community programs and policies. Many private firms and universities also conduct their own citizen surveys for similar purposes.

In 1991, the International City and County Manager's Association (ICMA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icma.org Untitled Document&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; published a book by Thomas Miller and Michelle Miller Kobayashi titled ''Citizen Surveys: How To Do Them, How To Use Them, and What They Mean'', that directed local government officials in the basic methods for conducting citizen surveys. The book was revised and republished in 2000. In 2001, ICMA partnered with Miller and Kobayashi's organization National Research Center, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-r-c.com National Research Center-Specializing in Performance Measurement and Evaluation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to bring The National Citizen Survey, a low-cost survey service, to local governments. National Research Center, Inc. maintains a [[database]] of over 500 jurisdictions representing more than 40 million Americans, allowing local governments to compare their cities' results with similar communities nearby or across the nation.

'''Clinical Health Promotion''' is Prevention, which includes elements of [[health promotion]] and [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], which takes place in the [[health care system]] together with patients.&lt;ref&gt;National Board of Health, Denmark “Terminology: Prevention, health promotion and public health” 2005, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intention is to focus on and integrate prevention into patient pathway to reduce decease progression, prevent complications and relapse as well as maximize coping and quality of life. Clinical health promotion emanates from the health care system where the patient is the active/activated part and hence the efforts also include elements of health promotion and rehabilitation.

Emphasis is placed on keeping choice and accountability with the patient, as well as empathy, feedback and positive expectations for the patient. The target audience is patients and the arena may be primary or secondary care where [[professional]]s in interaction with patients are engaged in clinical health promotion.

==Examples==
Examples of clinical health promotion are:

* [[Smoking]] cessation for [[pregnant]] women
* [[Alcohol]] cessation before [[surgery]]
* [[Physical activity]] program for [[mentally ill]]
* [[Diabetes]] education
* Control of [[asthma]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;National Board of Health, Denmark “Terminology: Prevention, health promotion and public health” 2005, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

David Berry Hart was born in [[Edinburgh]] on 12 October 1851.&lt;ref&gt; http://journals.lww.com/jpelvicsurgery/Citation/2009/02000/Powell_s_Pearls__David_Berry_Hart,_MD__1851_1920_.8.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|M.B.]], [[Master of Surgery|C.M.]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1877. Specialising in [[obstetrics]] and gynaecology, he continued his studies and obtained his doctorate [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] in 1880, with a gold medal and the Syme Surgical Fellowship on "''The Structural Anatomy of the female pelvic floor''".

He was Secretary of the Edinburgh Obstetrical Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Papers held at Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh
  | title = 1840-1938: minutes of Edinburgh Obstetrical Society
  | url= http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/nra/searches/subjectView.asp?ID=O31772
  | accessdate = 2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1879 and 1883 and became President in 1890. He was also Librarian to the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]]. In 1888 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Andrew Douglas Maclagan]], Sir [[Alexander Russell Simpson]], [[William Turner (anatomist)|Sir William Turner]], and Sir [[German Sims Woodhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Hart lived in an exceptionally fine [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] townhouse designed by [[Robert Adam]] at 29 [[Charlotte Square]] in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's First New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directories 1889 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an examiner in midwifery in the universities of Edinburgh, Oxford, Birmingham and Liverpool.

He was devoted to [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberalism]] and the [[United Free Church of Scotland]].

In later life he lived at 5 Randolph Cliff on the edge of the Moray Estate in Edinburgh's affluent West End.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1911-12&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Edinburgh on 10 June 1920.

==Publications==

*''Manual of Gynaecology'' (2 volumes), co-written with [[Alexander Hugh Freeland Barbour]] (1882 + 1891)&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8388782&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Atlas of the Female Pelvic Anatomy'' (1884)
*''Phases of Evolution and Heredity'' (1910)
*''Guide to Midwifery'' (1912)

==Family==
His maternal grandfather, David Berry, had been a [[General contractor|builder]] in Edinburgh. 

His wife was Jessie Smith Welsh Berry, a first cousin, and they had two daughters and two sons. His daughter, Elsa Margaret Berry Hart (d.1961) married the Hon Robert Hepburne-Scott (1873-1950).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thepeerage.com/p55189.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A granddaughter was [[Marian Lines]], a writer and [[actress]], and his grandson David Berry-Hart, painter and sculptor.

His great-granddaughter is [[Tess Berry-Hart]], playwright and novelist. 

==Specialist Interests==
Professor Hart wrote nine books and more than 70 papers. Among these were "''Manual of Gynaecology''", "''Guide to Midwifery''" and "''Some Phases of Evolution''". He contributed an article on "''Hermaphrodism in Man''" for "''Encyclopaedia Medica''".

Regarded by others as a tour de force of dubious utility, he drew on [[Mendelian]] principles with singular vigour. The sides of the [[vulval vestibule]] are visible as ''' Hart’s line'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://hymen-virgin-membrane.com/diseases_of_the_hymen_page_2.html Hart's line of D. Berry Hart, A. H. Barbour: ''Manual of Gynecology.'' Edinburgh 1882;  "the hymen separates the external genitals from the internal genitals"]&lt;/ref&gt; on the inside of the inner lips. Hart's line is the outer edge of the area and marks the change from vulvar skin to the smoother transitional skin of the vulva.

==Honours==
* Honorary Fellow of the American Gynaecological Society&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agosonline.org/history/index.asp The American Gynecological and Obstetrical Society (AGOS) was formed through the union of the American Gynecological Society and the American Association Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domains==
Various domains span digital health.&lt;ref name=ehj/&gt;&lt;ref name=widmer/&gt; These include [[Health technology|Healthcare technology]] assessment and monitoring to prevent, diagnose or treat diseases, monitoring of patients, or for rehabilitation or long-term care. Such technologies include [[Assistive technology|Assistive technologies]] and [[rehabilitation robotics]] for people with disabilities so as to aid in their independence to perform daily tasks, unobtrusive monitoring sensors and wearable devices. [[Clinical decision support system|Clinical decision support]] aids clinicians at the point of care, including diagnosis, analysis and interpretation of patient-related data.[[Computer simulation|Computational simulations]], modeling and [[machine learning]] approaches can model health-related outcomes. [[ehealth|E-health]] delivers health information and services to enable data transmition, storage and retrievial for clinical, educational and administrative purposes. Mobile health (or [[mhealth]]) is the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile devices.
[[Health systems engineering]] applications in health care systems, includes knowledge discovery, decision making, optimization, [[human factors and ergonomics|human factors engineering]], quality engineering, and information technology and communication.
Human-computer-environment interactions [[Human-computer interaction]] principles tend to be based around user-centered, experience-centered or activity-centered designs. [[Virtual reality]], [[video gaming rehabilitation]], and [[serious game]]s  to provide a social and interactive experience for healthcare student and patient education.  Speech and hearing systems for [[natural language processing]], [[speech recognition]] techniques, and medical devices can aid in speech and hearing (e.g. [[cochlear implant]]s).[[Telehealth]], [[telemedicine]], [[telecare]], telecoaching and [[telerehabilitation]] provide various forms of patient care remotely at a distance.

==Implementation==
National digital programs exist to support healthcare, such as those of [[Canada Health Infoway]] built on core systems of patient and provider registries, clinical and diagnostic imaging systems, clinical reports and [[immunization]]s.&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/what-we-do/progress-in-canada |title=Progress in Canada |website=Canada Health Infoway |publication-date=2016 |accessdate=11 November 2016 |dead-url=no |archive-date=12 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112155958/https://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/what-we-do/progress-in-canada |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, 75% of Canadian physicians were using electronic medical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=25487665|pmc=4284187 |date=6 January 2015 |last1=Collier|first1=Roger |title=National Physician Survey: EMR use at 75%|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=187|issue=1|pages=E17-8|doi=10.1503/cmaj.109-4957 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Uganda]] and [[Mozambique]], partnerships between patients with cell phones, local and regional governments, technologists, [[non-governmental organization]]s, academia, and industry have enabled mHealth solutions.&lt;ref name="jmir"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23353680|pmc=3636306|date=25 January 2013|last1=Källander|first1=Karin |title=Mobile health (mHealth) approaches and lessons for increased performance and retention of community health workers in low- and middle-income countries: A review|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=15|issue=1|page=e17 |last2=Tibenderana|first2=James  K. |last3=Akpogheneta|first3=Onome J. |last4=Strachan|first4=Daniel L. |last5=Hill|first5=Zelee |last6=ten Asbroek |first6=Augustinus H.A. |last7=Conteh|first7=Lesong |last8=Kirkwood|first8=Betty R. |last9=Meek|first9=Sylvia R. |doi=10.2196/jmir.2130 |doi-access=free }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation cycle===
The innovation process for digital health is an iterative cycle for technological solutions classified into five main activity processes beginning from the identification of the healthcare problem, research, digital solution, evaluating the solution to implementation in working clinical practices.&lt;ref name=ehj/&gt;&lt;ref name=widmer/&gt;

[[Image:HospicjumPallottinumhol1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The main hall of the Hospice]]
'''Father Eugeniusz Dutkiewicz SAC Hospice''' (formerly: Pallottinum Hospice) in [[Gdańsk]] is a charitable organisation founded by the [[Pallottine]] priest E. Dutkiewicz in 1983, which provides [[palliative care]] for the terminally ill.

==History==
Father E. Dutkiewicz SAC Hospice (formerly: Pallottinum Hospice) was established in Gdańsk in 1983 on the initiative of the Catholic Church, local medical staff and groups of volunteers. The founding movement was led by the Pallottine priest Eugeniusz Dutkiewicz, one of the pioneers of the concept of hospice care in Poland. In 1987, the Polish [[Episcopate]] appointed Fr Dutkiewicz the National Chaplain of Hospices in Poland in recognition of his active service for the development of [[hospice]] movement.

Since it was established, the Hospice in Gdańsk dynamically expanded its range of charitable activities. In 1991, The Regional Center of Palliative and Hospice Care (Wojewódzki Ośrodek Opieki Paliatywnej i Hospicyjnej) was founded, which is in charge of palliative care in Gdańsk. The Center also provides consultations in palliative medicine for the whole [[Pomerania]]n region. After Dutkiewicz's death in 2002, the Pallottine priest Piotr Krakowiak, PhD, became the new director of the Hospice and was appointed the National Chaplain of Hospices in Poland in the same year.
In 2003, the hospice house was created, which offers help to the most needy patients. June 2003 saw the opening of the hospice ward for terminally ill children, which is the first hospice ward for adolescent patients in Pomeranian region. In 2004, on the initiative of Fr Krakowiak, The Hospice Foundation (''Fundacja Hospicyjna'') was established. The foundation conducts charitable and educational activities throughout Poland, raising funds for more than a hundred of Polish hospices.
In January 2004, the Hospice obtained a new statute and assumed a new name in honour of its founder – the present name of the Hospice is: Father Eugeniusz Dutkiewicz SAC Hospice (''Hospicjum im. Ks. Eugeniusza Dutkiewicza SAC'').
==Hospice Services==
The Hospice offers two models of palliative care ― stationary hospice at a residence and home hospice, providing specialised care at a patient’s home. Both approaches are meant not only for adults but also for children.

The first form of help is aimed at the [[terminally ill]] patients whose families are unable to deliver constant care. The hospice residence provides thirty beds in rooms with separate sanitary fittings. The patients are entitled to stay at the stationary hospice for a long time; however, it is also possible to admit a patient for a shorter period ― until 10 days.

The philosophy of the home hospice consists in the co-operation of an interdisciplinary health care team with a patient's family. This model of help comprises personnel's visits at a patient's place of residence and provides specialised medical equipment, medicines and dressings.

Irrespective of the model of the care delivered, the hospice offers twenty-four-hour access to help ― also on Saturdays and Sundays. The hospice conducts necessary laboratory tests and tests with the use of specialised equipment. The palliative care team includes physicians, nurses, therapists, specialists carrying out rehabilitation, clergymen and charity workers. Apart from the standard services, the [[Pediatric]] Ward organises games for the youngest patients, with the help of the volunteers.
===Additional services===
What is more, next to the palliative care centre, functions the so-called Academy to Fight Against Cancer, which offers relaxation techniques workshop hosted by a trained professional. The main objective of creating such therapeutic classes is to provide psychological support to those who are wrestling with stress and suffering from recurring states of depression, the two disturbances often associated with the illness discussed.
A Palliative Care and Pain Therapy Outpatient Clinic has been established in the hospice house so as to deal with patients in the final stage of their disease. The clinic is intended to be visited by patients from Gdańsk and its environs who had completed casual treatment in hospital.

There is also a new initiative that has been born among the hospice team – the bereavement support groups for grieving persons. The workshop is hosted by an experienced therapist and aims at helping to endure the loss of a loved person. The participants of the workshop share the experience of loss and honour their relationships with their loved ones in an atmosphere of trust and openness.

It is worth mentioning that during their patients' difficult days, the hospice team strive to be with them and their kin, helping to alleviate their suffering also through common prayer. One can attend a special mass held every day in the hospice chapel in the intention of the ill.

==Voluntary Service==
===Medical Voluntary Service===
The primary purpose of Gdańsk hospice is to focus on the palliation of patients in the terminal phase of their illness. The professional medical team, i.e. doctors and nurses, additionally aided by both clergymen and volunteers, strive to improve quality of life for people facing this difficult period of their existence. Medical volunteers provide services to the ailing and their families not only in the stationary residence, but in patients' private homes as well. Some main examples of volunteers' duties are: providing assistance with personal care such as bathing, doing light housekeeping for the patients and their families, and being a comforting and supportive presence.

===Charity Campaigns===
In addition to the medical voluntary service, Gdańsk Hospice is also the organiser of various campaigns, both local and national. The aim of those is to help the ill and dying, as well as to popularise the hospice idea in society.

One of such campaigns is the ''WHAT programme'' (full name: ''Hospice Voluntary Service as a Tool of Acceptance and Tolerance Learning Tool among Prisoners''), whose pioneer is Father E. Dutkiewicz Hospice. In accordance with the programme's guiding principles, convicts and small offence criminals may join voluntary service. The programme was initiated in 2002, and since then has proved to be a success. The movie ''To Overcome Prejudice'' tells the story of this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hospicja.pl/newsbites/news/9449.html |title=''To Overcome Prejudice'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520062644/http://hospicja.pl/newsbites/news/9449.html |archivedate=20 May 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Fields of Hope' (''Pola Nadziei'') is an international campaign, first conducted in Scotland by the Marie Curie Cancer Care Foundation. In Poland, the first to organise this campaign was the Hospice in Kraków in 1998, and in 2003, Father Eugeniusz Dutkiewicz Hospice SAC in Gdańsk joined the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospicjum.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=5 |title=Pola Nadziei w Gdańsku |language=pl |trans-title=Fields of Hope in Gdańsk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721205043/http://www.hospicjum.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=5 |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, around 4 October, thousands of people plant [[Narcissus (plant)|daffodils]] (at hospitals, schools, government buildings, etc.) as a symbol of solidarity with cancer patients. In spring, when the flowers are in bloom, begins the action aiming to gather funds for providing hospice care. The volunteers, dressed in yellow T-shirts, collect money for the hospice on streets, in parks, in front of churches and shopping malls. A daffodil flower – the symbol of hope – is given out in thanks for contributions. The fund-raising is accompanied by various artistic happenings (e.g. concerts). In addition to gaining monetary fundings for the hospices, Fields of Hope is also aimed at promoting the idea of hospice care, informing the society of its role and activity, as well as sensitising people to the needs of terminally ill patients.

The ''Package from the Heart'' campaign (''Paczka od Serca'') is organised each year in December, with the aim of helping the youngest patients. Within the campaign, an auction of special packages is held. The contents of said packages are composed by media, movie, music and sports celebrities.

The ''Become a Gdańsk Angel'' campaign (''Zostań Gdańskim Aniołem'') has taken place during the 749th Dominican Fair (Jarmark Św. Dominika).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospicjum.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=518&amp;Itemid=5 |title=Zostań Gdańskim Aniołem |language=pl |trans-title=Become A Gdańsk Angel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721205100/http://www.hospicjum.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=518&amp;Itemid=5 |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The volunteers, dressed as angels, took part in the opening parade, and organised an additional attraction for spectators and the ill from Gdańsk Hospice. The aim of this campaign was to help people realise the importance of helping others, and also to call attention to the suffering of another.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26058">'''Female copulatory vocalizations''', also called '''female copulation calls''' or '''coital vocalizations''', are produced by female [[primate]]s, including [[woman|human females]], and female non-primates. Copulatory vocalizations usually occur during [[sexual intercourse]] and are hence related to [[sexual activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornhill|first1=R.|last2=Gangestad|first2=S. W.|title=The Evolutionary Biology of Human Female Sexuality|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIE8DwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=vocalizations%20OR%20%22copulation%20calls%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalizations that occur before intercourse, for the purpose of attracting mates, are known as [[mating call]]s.

In [[primate]]s, copulation calling is typically observed at the end of [[mating]]&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pradhan|first1=Gauri|last2=Engelhardt|first2=Antje|last3=van Schaik|first3=Carel|last4=Maestripieri|first4=Dario|title=The evolution of female copulation calls in primates: a review and a new model|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=January 2006|volume=59|issue=3|pages=333–343|doi=10.1007/s00265-005-0075-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are vast variations between species regarding its occurrence, frequency and form. It is agreed that coital vocalizations fulfill an [[evolution]]ary purpose&lt;ref name="Dixson 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dixson|first1=A.|title=Primate Sexuality: Comparative Studies of the Prosimians, Monkeys, Apes, and Humans|date=2013|publisher=Oxford: UOP}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that they serve as adaptive solutions to problems that the females face, such as [[infanticide]], as well as [[sperm competition|obtaining high quality sperm]].&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt;

In non-primates, copulatory calling predominantly occurs before copulation in order to attract mates ([[mating call]]). Calls vary in [[frequency]] (14&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to 70,000&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) and function. One of the main purposes of females vocalizing is the induction of [[mate guarding]] behavior in males.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Conversely, calls may also be used in order to attract high ranking mates who can prevent intercourse with the initial partner.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is done to incite [[sexual selection|male mate competition]].

In humans, coital vocalizations are linked to [[orgasm]],&lt;ref name="Sex at Dawn"&gt;Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha, ‘’[[Sex at Dawn|Sex at Dawn: How We Mate, Why We Stray, and What It Means for Modern Relationships]]’’ (Harper Perennial, 2011), pp. 255-57.&lt;/ref&gt; hence occurring during [[sexual intercourse|copulation]] and serving as an expression of sexual pleasure. Vocalizations can be used intentionally by women in order to boost the self-esteem of their partner and to cause quicker [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref name="GayleBrewer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = Gayle | last2 = Hendrie | first2 = Colin A. | year = 2011 | title = Evidence to Suggest that Copulatory Vocalizations in Women Are Not a Reflexive Consequence of Orgasm | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 559–64 | pmid = 20480220 | doi=10.1007/s10508-010-9632-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occurrence, frequency and form===

[[File:Vocalization sonograms.jpg|thumb|Sonograms of female copulatory vocalizations of a human female (top), female baboon (middle), and female gibbon (bottom),&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = J. | last2 = Arrowood | first2 = P. C. | year = 1978 | title = Copulatory Vocalizations of Chacma Baboons (Papio Ursinus), gibbons (Hylobates Hoolock) and Humans | url = | journal = Science | volume = 200 | issue = 1405| pages = 1406–07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with time being plotted on the x-axis and the [[Audio frequency|pitch]] being represented on the y-axis.]]In non-human primates, copulatory vocalizations begin towards the end of the copulatory act or even after copulation.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; The percentage of vocalizations after copulation varies dependent on the non-human primate species studied. In long-tail macaques, for instance, 80% of copulations are followed by [[Sexual intercourse|copulation]] calls. In contrast, the percentage for [[chimpanzee]]s and [[Tonkean macaque]]s has been found to be 78.8% and 6%, respectively.&lt;ref name="Maestripieri 106–113"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Primate copulation calls and postcopulatory female choice|url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/1/106|journal = Behavioral Ecology|date = 2005-01-01|issn = 1045-2249|pages = 106–113|volume = 16|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/beheco/arh120|language = en|first = Dario|last = Maestripieri|first2 = James R.|last2 = Roney}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little consensus on what causes these inter-specific differences, given the lack of consistent findings within the literature.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; The typical quantity of specimen that are tested in [[experiment|experimental settings]] is often too low in order to allow any [[inference|general conclusions]] about the species as a whole.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt;
Another aspect of [[Sexual intercourse|coital]] vocalization that varies according to species is the form of the call: in [[macaque]]s and [[baboon]]s they manifest themselves as [[Guttural|grunts]], whereas other species such as [[talapoin]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s typically emit [[screaming]] sounds.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; The quality and structure of copulatory calls are analyzed by comparing their respective [[spectrogram]]s in terms of their frequency. Accordingly, some species produce calls that are structurally more complex than that of others. This is linked to the amount of [[Animal sexual behavior#Promiscuity|promiscuity]] exhibited, in a way that more promiscuous species emit more faceted calls in order to convey more information about themselves and hence render [[Signalling theory|self-advertisement]] more efficient.&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07"/&gt;

===Adaptive function===

[[File:World 06 temp-1416046030-546725ce-620x348.jpg|thumb|A male Chacma baboon shows aggression towards a female and her offspring.]]Copulatory calls in primates serve an [[Adaptation|adaptive function]] and are [[sexual selection|sexually selected]].&lt;ref name="Dixson 2013"/&gt; Calling signals sexual receptivity of the female and therefore affects [[mate choice]]. There are many different hypotheses as to the exact adaptive function of female copulatory calls in primates and research on the subject is still in its early stages.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt;

There is general agreement that copulatory calls are the adaptive solution to problems with [[reproductive success]]. In other words, copulatory vocalizations address issues that stand in the way of successfully producing [[offspring]] and guaranteeing its survival, such as the occurrence of infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maestripieri|first1=Dario|title=Post-Copulatory Sexual Selection and Female Mating Vocalizations in Primates|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhVRetJZrkM|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent the killing of their offspring, female baboons employ copulatory calls in order to attract other males, allowing multiple mating acts and creating parental confusion among the males involved. The resulting uncertainty of who the father is hence reduces the occurrence of attacks, given the newly incited risk of potentially harming their own offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Infanticide avoidance, sperm competition and mate choice: the function of copulation calls in female baboons|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347284712887|journal = Animal Behaviour|date = 1994-09-01|pages = 687–694|volume = 48|issue = 3|doi = 10.1006/anbe.1994.1288|first = Sanjida M.|last = O'Connell|first2 = Guy|last2 = Cowlishaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, mating in rapid successions also entails sperm competition, and therefore fulfills the additional function of obtaining high quality sperm.&lt;ref name="stockley"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Stockley |first1= P|year= 1997|title= Sexual conflict resulting from adaptations to sperm competition |volume= 12|pages= 154–159|journal= Trends Ecol. Evol.|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01000-8 |issue= 4 |pmid= 21238013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important in species that do not openly advertise good genes via [[honest signal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maestripieri|first1=Dario|last2=Roney|first2=James|title=Primate copulation calls and post-copulatory female choice|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=2005|volume=16|pages=106–113|doi=10.1093/beheco/arh120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By attracting other males through post-copulatory calls, the female might provoke mate guarding behavior in their initial mate. This 'parental concentration',&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; has two outcomes. Firstly, the male might be of high [[Fitness (biology)|quality]], allowing him to fend off those that were attracted by the call. In that case the female has not only gained someone who can protect her and who prevents infanticide through other males, but this also means that she was [[insemination|inseminated]] by a specimen with potentially good genes. Secondly, if the male fails to successfully guard her, she will mate with the newly arrived males, hence inciting sperm competition and paternity confusion (again preventing [[infanticide|attacks on her offspring]], as well as increasing her likelihood of obtaining high quality sperm). The calls produced by the female also carries information about the [[Dominance hierarchy|status]] of the male with whom she was copulating, thus allowing her to influence the likelihood of other males approaching.&lt;ref name="Sex at Dawn"/&gt;

Accordingly, copulatory calls serve more than a single adaptive function. There is no [[mutual exclusivity]] when it comes to addressing the two problems described, namely that of infanticide and receiving high quality sperm. However, by taking the female's [[menstrual cycle|cycle stage]] into account, sperm competition can be ruled out as the primary underlying cause of copulatory calling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Townsend|first1=Simon|last2=Deschner|first2=T|last3=Zuberbühler|first3=K|title=Female chimpanzees use copulation calls flexibly to prevent social competition|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2008|volume=3 | issue = 6 |page=e2431|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002431|pmid=22423311|pmc=3278306}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, females produce coital vocalizations also when they mate during non-fertile periods, which is therefore primarily aimed at attracting as many males as possible and to create parental confusion rather than obtaining high quality sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lukas|first1=Dieter|last2=Huchard|first2=Elise|title=The evolution of infanticide by males in mammalian societies|journal=Science|date=2014|volume=346|issue=6211|pages=841–843|doi=10.1126/science.1257226|pmid=25395534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females have no interest in advertising their periods of [[fertility]], given that males would pick up on these patterns, reducing paternal confusion and causing an increase in [[infanticide|aggressive behavior towards her offspring]] from other males.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; Such hidden fertility has been coined [[concealed ovulation]], and is part of [[extended female sexuality]].

=== Alternative benefits ===

In addition to the incitement of parental confusion in order to avoid infanticide, female primates that exhibit [[promiscuity|promiscuous behavior]] also reap non-genetic material benefits. A female that uses vocalizations after copulating with her mate attracts other males, with whom she is also likely to engage in multiple acts of mating.&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07"/&gt; As a consequence male mates provide non-genetic benefits, such as food, to the female they mated with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodrı́guez-Gironés|first1=M. A.|last2=Enquist|first2=M.|title=The evolution of female sexuality|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2001|volume=61|issue=4|pages=695–704|doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1630}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such vocalization-facilitated promiscuity heightens the female's [[reproductive success]]. The strategy to mate with multiple partners in order to obtain material benefits can equally be observed in non-primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=P. B.|title=Female promiscuity and male reproductive success in social birds and mammals.|journal=American Naturalist|date=1982|pages=51–64|doi=10.1086/283969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In non-primates ==

=== Occurrence ===

In addition to emitting copulatory vocalizations during and after copulation (as it is mostly seen in primates), non-primate species also vocalize before engaging in mating. Vocalizations that are made prior to copulation are named [[mating call]]s. They serve as a means to advertise sexual receptivity and are predominantly used by males to attract female mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fedorka|first1=K.|last2=Mousseau|first2=T.|title=Material and genetic benefits of female multiple mating and polyandry|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2001|volume=64|issue=3|pages=361–367|doi=10.1006/anbe.2002.3052}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, non-primates emit more calls before copulating, as exemplified by the [[frog#call|croak]]s of male frogs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilczynski | first1 = W. | last2 = McClelland | first2 = B.

=== Properties ===
[[File:Elephant Berlin Zoo having Sex cropped.JPG|thumb|Elephant copulation.]]
In regard to the calling properties, frequency analysis is typically used in research to look at the complexity of the vocalization and to distinguish between calls, which is important in determining their function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerhardt|first1=C.|title=Mating call recognition in the green treefrog (Hyla cinerea): importance of two frequency bands as a function of sound pressure level.|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|date=1981|volume=144 | issue = 1 |pages=9–16|doi=10.1007/bf00612792}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large frequency variations have been noted between species, ranging from 14&amp;nbsp;Hz to 70,000&amp;nbsp;Hz. [[Mice]], for instance, use 70,000&amp;nbsp;Hz calls continuously prior to copulation. They then lower the frequency down to 40,000&amp;nbsp;Hz during the copulatory act, therefore two qualitatively different calls are used for attracting mates as compared to the actual act of mating.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = N.

They use these [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] calls (&gt; 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz and hence not discernible by the human ear) to attract females, with the quantity of calls being related to the male's mating success, making these vocalizations a [[sexual selection|sexually selected]] trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pomerantz | first1 = S.

On the other end of the spectrum, female [[African elephant]]s use very low frequency calls of 14–35&amp;nbsp;Hz prior to, as well as during, copulation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poole | first1 = J.

The vocalizations of female elephants are also used in order to incite [[mate guarding]] behavior in the male,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=J.|title=Mate guarding, reproductive success and female choice in African elephants|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1989|volume=37|pages=842–849|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(89)90068-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which manifests itself in the form of fighting off any newly arriving mates. Not only females make use of this, as male [[Columbian ground squirrel]]s have been observed to use copulatory vocalizations in order to announce their post-copulatory mate guarding to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Manno | first1 = T. G. | last2 = Nesterova | first2 = A. P. | last3 = Debarbieri | first3 = L. M. | last4 = Kennedy | first4 = S. E. | last5 = Wright | first5 = K. S. | last6 = Dobson | first6 = F.

[[Red junglefowl]]s, for instance, utilize calls in order to prevent or end unwanted copulations by attracting another high-ranking male fowl.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Løvlie | first1 = H. | last2 = Zidar | first2 = J. | last3 = Berneheim | first3 = C. | year = 2014 | title = A cry for help: Female distress calling during copulation is context dependent | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 151–157 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further effects of female calling on male's behavior are illustrated by [[spider]]s that have been shown to [[Stridulation|stridulate]] before copulation to inform males of sexual receptivity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dutto | first1 = M.

Moreover, attracting new mates by calling out during copulation can entail many benefits for the female. Female [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s which mate with multiple partners receive a greater number of [[nuptial gift]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tregenza|first1=T.|last2=Wedell|first2=N.|title=Benefits of Multiple Mates in the Cricket Gryllus bimaculatus|journal=Evolution|date=1998|volume=52|issue=6|pages=1726–1730|doi=10.2307/2411345|jstor=2411345}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing them to lay a larger quantity of eggs, hence increasing their [[reproductive success]].

==In humans==

Theories are more diverse in regard to women’s sexual vocalizing. On the one hand, researchers have noted some apparently communicative patterns in women’s copulatory vocalizations that suggest some parallels with those of other primates (including an invitation to sperm competition, given that female sexual vocalizations, like those of other primates, serve as "copulation calls" noticeable to other men and exciting to them if overheard&lt;ref name="Sex at Dawn"/&gt;). One study, for instance, has noted that female sexual vocalizations tend to become more intense as she approaches orgasm; at orgasm her vocalization tends to become very rapid, with a regular rhythm that includes equal note lengths and intervals between notes, which male vocalization typically lacks.&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07" /&gt; This is especially frequent when her orgasm occurs during penile-vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref name="GayleBrewer" /&gt; By exciting her partner with her vocalizations and bringing about his orgasm at that point, she helps ensure that the [[semen|seminal pool]] is available for her [[cervix]] to dip into as her [[vagina]] relaxes after her orgasm.&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07"/&gt; Copulatory vocalizations may also be a type of mate retention behaviour. One study found that women who perceived a high risk of [[infidelity]] in their relationship were more likely to utilize copulatory vocalizations in order to [[Fake orgasm|fake an orgasm]], along with other mate retention behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaighobadi|first=Farnaz|last2=Shackelford|first2=Todd K.|last3=Weekes-Shackelford|first3=Viviana A.|date=2011-11-17|title=Do Women Pretend Orgasm to Retain a Mate?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-011-9874-6|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=41|issue=5|pages=1121–1125|doi=10.1007/s10508-011-9874-6|issn=0004-0002|pmc=3563256|pmid=22089325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, recent studies have indicated that most copulatory vocalizations in women do not accompany their own orgasm, but rather their partner’s ejaculation. The study showed that the man typically finds the woman’s vocalization arousing and highly exciting, and that the woman herself is aware of this. Most women in the study, furthermore, indicated that they vocalized during intercourse to make their man ejaculate more quickly, or to boost his enjoyment or [[self-esteem]], or both.&lt;ref name="GayleBrewer"/&gt; A correlation has been found between the frequency of vocalizations and sexual satisfaction for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Babin | first1 = E. A. | year = 2013 | title = An examination of predictors of nonverbal and verbal communication of pleasure during sex and sexual satisfaction | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 270–292 | doi=10.1177/0265407512454523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons that women gave for wanting to force a quick ejaculation include the alleviation of the female's pain, fatigue, or even boredom, or simply to stay within some imposed time restriction for sexual activity. Reasons for wanting to boost the male self-esteem included reinforcing the [[pair bond]] that intercourse helps to strengthen, and thus reducing emotional and sexual infidelity and abandonment.&lt;ref name="GayleBrewer" /&gt; The researchers note that all of these goals are apparently congruent with female copulatory vocalizations in non-human primates.

It is also possible that some vocalizations are due to [[hyperventilation]]. Both men and women can experience hyperventilation during sexual arousal,&lt;ref&gt;Masters W. H., Johnson V. E. Human Sexual Response. Boston: Little Brown and Co, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; which can involve involuntary vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Passie | first1 = T. | last2 = Hartman | first2 = U. | last3 = Schneider | first3 = U. | last4 = Emrich | first4 = H.M. | year = 2003 | title = On the function of groaning and hyperventilation during sexual intercourse: Intensification of sexual experience by altering brain metabolism through hypercapnia | url = | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 60 | issue = 5| pages = 660–663 | doi=10.1016/s0306-9877(03)00010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fetal [[heart]], the '''foramen ovale''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|r|eɪ|m|ən|_|oʊ|ˈ|v|æ|l|i|,_|-|m|ɛ|n|-|,_|-|ˈ|v|ɑː|-|,_|-|ˈ|v|eɪ|-}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|accessdate=2016-01-22|foramen}} {{MerriamWebsterDictionary|accessdate=2016-01-22|ovale}}}}{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-22|foramen}}}}{{refn|{{Dictionary.com|accessdate=2016-01-22|foramen}}}}), also '''foramen Botalli''', '''ostium secundum of Born''' or '''falx septi''', allows blood to enter the left [[atrium (heart)|atrium]] from the right atrium. It is one of two fetal [[cardiac shunt]]s, the other being the [[ductus arteriosus]] (which allows blood that still escapes to the right ventricle to bypass the [[pulmonary circulation]]). Another similar adaptation in the fetus is the [[ductus venosus]]. In most individuals, the foramen ovale closes at birth. It later forms the [[fossa ovalis (heart)|fossa ovalis]].

== Development ==
{{main|Interatrial septum#Development}}
The foramen ovale ({{ety|la||oval hole}}) forms in the late fourth week of [[gestation]], as a small passageway between the septum secundum the ostium secundum. Initially the atria are separated from one another by the [[septum primum]] except for a small opening below the septum, the [[ostium primum]]. As the septum primum grows, the ostium primum narrows and eventually closes. Before it does so, bloodflow from the [[inferior vena cava]] wears down a portion of the septum primum, forming the [[ostium secundum]]. Some embryologists postulate that the ostium secundum may be formed through [[programmed cell death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sadler |first= Thomas W. |title= [[Langman's Essential Medical Embryology]] |publisher= [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]] |year= 2004 |isbn= 0-7817-5571-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ostium secundum provides communication between the atria after the ostium primum closes completely. Subsequently, a second wall of tissue, the [[septum secundum]], grows over the ostium secundum in the right atrium. Blood then only passes from the right to left atrium by way of a small passageway in the septum secundum and then through the ostium secundum. This passageway is called the foramen ovale''.

=== Closure ===
The foramen ovale normally closes at birth. At birth, when the lungs become functional, the pulmonary vascular pressure decreases and the left atrial pressure exceeds that of the right. This forces the [[septum primum]] against the [[septum secundum]], functionally closing the foramen ovale. In time the septa eventually fuse, leaving a remnant of the foramen ovale, the [[fossa ovalis (heart)|fossa ovalis]].

== Function ==
A [[fetus]] receives oxygen not from its lungs, but from the mother's oxygen-rich blood via the [[placenta]]. Oxygenated blood from the placenta travels through the umbilical cord to the right atrium of the fetal heart. As the fetal lungs are non-functional at this time, it is more efficient for the blood to bypass them. This is accomplished through 2 cardiac shunts. The first is the foramen ovale which shunts blood from the right atrium to the left atrium. The second is the [[ductus arteriosus]] which shunts blood from the pulmonary artery (which, after birth, carries blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs) to the descending aorta.these oval are close after 3month of born baby and in another condition those oval does not close

==Clinical significance==
{{main|Patent foramen ovale}}
In about 25% of adults the foramen ovale does not close completely, but remains as a small [[Atrial septal defect#Patent foramen ovale|patent foramen ovale ("PFO")]].&lt;ref name="Homma2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Homma|first1=S.|title=Patent Foramen Ovale and Stroke|journal=Circulation|volume=112|issue=7|year=2005|pages=1063–1072|issn=0009-7322|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.524371|pmid=16103257}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most of these individuals, the PFO causes no problems and remains undetected throughout life.

PFO has long been studied because of its role in [[paradoxical embolism]] (an [[embolism]] that travels from the venous side to the arterial side). This may lead to a [[stroke]] or [[transient ischemic attack]]. [[Transesophageal echocardiogram|Transesophageal echocardiography]] is considered the most accurate investigation to demonstrate a patent foramen ovale. A patent foramen ovale may also be an incidental finding.

'''Grisel’s syndrome''' is a non-traumatic [[subluxation]] of the [[atlanto-axial joint]] caused by [[inflammation]] of the adjacent tissues. This is a rare disease that usually affects children. Progressive throat and neck pain and neck stiffness can be followed by [[neurologic]] symptoms such as pain or numbness radiating to arms ([[radiculopathies]]). In extreme cases, the condition can lead to [[quadriplegia]] and even death from [[acute respiratory failure]].  The condition often follows soft tissue inflammation in the neck such as in cases of upper [[respiratory tract infections]], peritonsillar or [[retropharyngeal abscesses]].  Post-operative inflammation after certain procedures such as [[adenoidectomy]] can also lead to this condition in susceptible individuals such as those with [[Down's syndrome]].

==Pathophysiology==
[[Pathophysiology]] of this disease consists of relaxation of the [[transverse ligament]] of the atlanto-axial joint.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis can be established using plain film [[x-rays]] as well as [[CT scan]] of the neck/cervical spine. Children with Down's syndrome have inherently lax ligaments making them susceptible to this condition. In select cases, these children may require pre-operative imaging to assess the risk for complications after procedures such as [[adenoidectomy]].

==Treatment==
Treatment includes [[Anti-inflammatory|anti-inflammatory medications]] and immobilization of the neck in addition to treatment of the offending infectious cause (if any) with appropriate [[antibiotics]]. Early treatment is crucial to prevent long-term [[sequelae]]. Surgical fusion may be required for residual instability of the joint.

''' Dr Gunasagaran [[Gounder]]''' is a [[Indians in Fiji|Fiji Indian]] medical doctor who, as a [[Fiji Labour Party]] candidate, defeated the [[Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)|Leader of Opposition]], [[Jai Ram Reddy]] of the [[National Federation Party]], in the contest for the [[Yasawa Nawaka (Open Constituency, Fiji)|Yasawa Nawaka Open Constituency]] seat in the [[Fijian general election, 1999|1999 general election]]. He was subsequently appointed Assistant Minister for Health in the [[People's Coalition (Fiji)|Peoples Coalition Government]]  led by [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] from 1999 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawakibeqa.tripod.com/achievements.htm Achievements of FLP]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2000, he was among the 43 members of the People's Coalition Government, led by Mahendra Chaudhry, taken hostage by [[George Speight]] and his band of rebel [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces]] (RFMF) soldiers from the [[Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit]]. He was released on 13 July 2000 after 56 days of captivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijihosting.com/pcgov/docs_c/activities_report_2000.htm Fiji Labour Party - Activities Report: 1999-2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001 to 2006, he represented the [[Nadi Rural (Indian Communal Constituency, Fiji)|Nadi Rural]] [[Communal constituencies|Indian Communal Constituency]], one of 19 reserved for [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijians]], which he held for the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) in the [[Fijian general election, 2001|parliamentary elections]] of 2001 with almost 69 percent of the vote.

In 2003, Goundar was offered the portfolio of Minister for Health Promotion, together with 13 other FLP parliamentarians who were offered cabinet positions by the Prime Minister, [[Laisenia Qarase]] but the FLP refused to accept this offer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/cgi-bin/cms/exec/view.cgi/8/1196/printer PM announces 14 FLP Ministers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231649/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/cgi-bin/cms/exec/view.cgi/8/1196/printer |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Fijian general election, 2006|2006 general election]], Gounder transferred to the neighbouring [[Nadi Urban (Indian Communal Constituency, Fiji)|Nadi Urban]] Indian Communal Constituency and held it for the FLP with more than 76 percent of the vote.  He was subsequently named as one of nine FLP Ministers in the multi-party Cabinet that was formed and served in the [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet]] as [[Minister for Curative Health Services (Fiji)|Minister for Curative Health Services]].

Gounder's political career was ended by the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] that took place on 5 December 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6001">==Prevalence==
[[Jordan]] has low [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] prevalence, but if preventive measures are not implemented, HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases could increase or re-emerge and have significant social and economic consequences.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

In 2007, there were an estimated 380,000 people living with HIV/AIDS ([[PLWHA]]) in the region, according to UNAIDS. Although figures are low compared with southern Africa or Asia, they are still a cause for alarm, particularly since they are rising rapidly, especially among high-risk groups, such as injecting drug users (IDUs) and vulnerable youth. Systematic monitoring of the epidemic, however, is far from complete. Surveillance systems remain inadequate in their coverage of at-risk groups and thus fail to reflect risk behaviors or provide incidence and prevalence rates.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

In addition to weak surveillance, the adoption of preventive practices is very limited, the participation of PLWHA and civil society in the HIV/AIDS response is still nascent, and despite some progress, general attitudes, institutions, and laws often do not facilitate implementation of an expanded response. The first step in addressing the spread of HIV/AIDS is recognizing the presence of the disease and the sociocultural, political, and economic patterns that fuel and bear the burden of its impact.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Although the [[Ministry of Health (Jordan)|Ministry of Health]] (MOH) reported that 550 cases of HIV/AIDS were diagnosed in Jordan as of December 2007, the actual number is thought to be much higher due to under-reporting. For those cases diagnosed, the routes of transmission included 16.5 percent through blood and blood products, 60 percent through sexual transmission, and 3.3 percent through injection drug use. [[Perinatal]] HIV transmission accounted for 1.5 percent, and 18.2 percent of cases were of unknown transmission route. In addition, a significant number of diagnosed HIV/AIDS cases are from foreigners in Jordan (185 [[Jordanians]] and 365 non-Jordanians). Since the first case of HIV/AIDS in Jordan was diagnosed in 1986, 85 Jordanians have died of AIDS. Little is known about HIV prevalence rates in high-risk populations in Jordan.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

A 2003 assessment conducted of about 1,200 women presenting to obstetrics and gynecological clinics in urban centers in [[Amman]], [[Zarka]], and [[Rusaifah]] showed a prevalence of [[gonorrhea]] of 0.7 percent, [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]]l infection of 1.2 percent, [[trichomoniasis]] of 1.2 percent, [[bacterial vaginosis]] of 5.4 percent, and [[candidiasis]] of 19.1 percent. Regional variations indicate that rates are much higher in some sites than in others. No [[syphilis]] infection was identified.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Stigma and discrimination against PLWHA prevails, as 29 percent of ever-married women surveyed in the 2002 Demographic and Health Survey were unwilling to care for PLWHA at home, while 63.5 percent of young people responding to a knowledge, attitude, practice, and behavior study believed that AIDS patients should be isolated.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Jordan’s cultural sensitivities pose the greatest threat to the country’s low prevalence. Because of difficulties in discussing sexual matters, many Jordanians still harbor misconceptions about HIV/AIDS and PLWHA. A 2005 study of the general population ([[USAID]]/JHU/HCP: [[2005 Communication Partnership for Family Health Baseline Survey]], Key Results) found that talking about HIV/AIDS is still taboo and that PLWHA still face stigma and discrimination. For instance, 65 percent of women and men said people with the AIDS virus should not be allowed to work with others in shops, offices, or on farms, even if they are not feeling sick. Many people responding to the survey did not understand how to prevent HIV/AIDS and did not know that condoms can be used for this purpose.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

At an estimated two new cases of [[tuberculosis]] (TB) per 100,000 people ([[WHO]] 2005), TB incidence in Jordan is relatively low. Currently, fewer than 1 percent of adult TB patients are HIV-positive. However, continued monitoring is necessary because an increase in the incidence of HIV-TB co-infection could add to the complexity of fighting both diseases in Jordan.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/ane/Jordan_profile.pdf "Health Profile: Jordan"]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (March 2008). Accessed August 25, 2008. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National response==
Jordan’s national response to HIV/AIDS is characterized by strong political commitment to addressing HIV. The response is managed through the [[MOH National AIDS Program]] (NAP) and includes the formation of a [[National AIDS Committee]] and the appointment of an AIDS program manager. The MOH
continues to support the national blood transfusion service, mandatory HIV testing, strong control measures for foreigners who reside in Jordan, and provision of [[antiretroviral]] (ARV) drugs for Jordanians who test HIV-positive. There are currently 12 part-time focal point persons who are responsible for HIV/AIDS in all governorates of the country.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

In 2005, Jordan launched the [[National HIV/AIDS Strategy]] (2005–2009), outlining the key goals, objectives, and initiatives for the response. The key goal is to maintain low HIV prevalence among the population and all vulnerable sub-populations of Jordan.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Jordan has received funding from the [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] to strengthen and expand existing HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and support activities since 2003. In July 2007, the MOH was granted $1.25 million from the Global Fund to maintain low HIV prevalence among its population.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

{{Healthcare reform in the United States}}

There were a number of different '''health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration'''. Key reforms address cost and coverage and include obesity, prevention and treatment of chronic conditions, defensive medicine or tort reform, incentives that reward more care instead of better care, redundant payment systems, tax policy, rationing, a shortage of doctors and nurses, intervention vs. hospice, fraud, and use of imaging technology, among others.

The first of these reform proposals to be passed by the [[United States Congress]] is the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], which originated in the Senate and was later passed by the House of Representatives in amended form on March 21, 2010 (with a vote of 219–212).&lt;ref name=LeveyHook032210&gt;Noam N. Levey and Janet Hook, "[http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-na-healthcare-passage22-2010mar22,0,2788293.story?track=rss House passes historic healthcare overhaul]," ''Los Angeles Times'' (March 22, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csbj.com/2010/03/22/house-sends-health-care-overhaul-bill-to-obama/ |title=House sends health care overhaul bill to Obama |date=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama signed the reforms into law on March 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/03/23/health.care.main/index.html |title=CNN-Obama Signs Health Bill-March 23, 2010 |publisher=CNN |date=March 23, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reuters and CNN summarized the reforms and the year in which they take effect.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1914020220100319 |title=Reuters-Factbox-U.S. Healthcare Bill Would Provide Immediate Benefits-March 19, 2010 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |first=Donna |last=Smith |date=March 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/03/23/health.care.timeline/index.html |title=CNN-Timeline-When Healthcare Reform Will Affect You-March 23, 2010 |publisher=CNN |date=March 23, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:OECD life expectacy and health spending per capita 2013 v1.png|thumb|right|450px|Chart showing life expectancy at birth and health care spending per capita for OECD countries as of 2015. The U.S. is an outlier, with much higher spending but below average life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/health/health-systems/health-at-a-glance-19991312.htm OECD Health at a Glance 2015-Table 3.3]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A variety of specific types of reform have been suggested to improve the United States health care system.  These range from increased use of health care technology through changing the anti-trust rules governing health insurance companies and tort-reform to rationing of care.  Different overall strategies have been suggested as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb1205901 New England Journal of Medicine-A Systemic Approach to Containing Healthcare Spending-September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of Medicine]] reported in September 2012 that approximately $750B per year in U.S. [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]] are avoidable or wasted. This included: unnecessary services ($210 billion annually); inefficient delivery of care ($130 billion); excess administrative costs ($190 billion); inflated prices ($105 billion); prevention failures ($55 billion), and fraud ($75 billion).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/09/how-the-us-health-care-system-wastes-750-billion-annually/262106/The Atlantic-Brian Fung-How the U.S. Healthcare System Wastes $750B Annually-September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a June 2009 speech, President [[Barack Obama]] outlined his strategy for reform. He mentioned electronic record-keeping, preventing expensive conditions, reducing obesity, refocusing doctor incentives from quantity of care to quality, [[Bundled payment|bundling payments]] for treatment of conditions rather than specific services, better identifying and communicating the most cost-effective treatments, and reducing defensive medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-to-the-Annual-Conference-of-the-American-Medical-Association |title=Remarks by the President to the AMA-June 15, 2009 |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313084300/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-to-the-Annual-Conference-of-the-American-Medical-Association/ |archivedate=March 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Obama further described his plan in a September 2009 speech to a joint session of Congress. His plan mentions: deficit neutrality; not allowing insurance companies to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions; capping out of pocket expenses; creation of an [[health insurance exchange|insurance exchange]] for individuals and small businesses; tax credits for individuals and small companies; independent commissions to identify fraud, waste and abuse; and malpractice reform projects, among other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/obama_plan_card.PDF |title=Summary of Obama Plan |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-to-a-Joint-Session-of-Congress-on-Health-Care/ |title=Remarks by the President to a Joint Session of Congress-September 2009 |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115143543/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-to-a-Joint-Session-of-Congress-on-Health-Care/ |archivedate=January 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, then-[[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] Director [[Peter Orszag]] described aspects of the Obama administration's strategy during an interview: "In order to help contain [ [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] ] cost growth over the long term, we need a new health care system that has digitized information...in which that information is used to assess what’s working and what’s not more intelligently, and in which we’re paying for quality rather than quantity while also encouraging prevention and wellness." He also argued for bundling payments and [[accountable care organization]]s, which reward doctors for teamwork and patient outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10697 |title=Charlie Rose-Peter Orszag Interview-November 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111174416/http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10697 |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mayo Clinic]] President and CEO Denis Cortese has advocated an overall strategy to guide reform efforts. He argued that the U.S. has an opportunity to redesign its healthcare system and that there is a wide consensus that reform is necessary. He articulated four "pillars" of such a strategy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10496 |title=Denis Cortese Interview on Charlie Rose Show-July 2009 |publisher=Charlierose.com |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322151337/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10496 |archivedate=March 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Focus on value, which he defined as the ratio of quality of service provided relative to cost;
*Pay for and align incentives with value;
*Cover everyone;
*Establish mechanisms for improving the healthcare service delivery system over the long-term, which is the primary means through which value would be improved.

Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', surgeon [[Atul Gawande]] further distinguished between the delivery system, which refers to how medical services are provided to patients, and the payment system, which refers to how payments for services are processed. He argued that reform of the delivery system is critical to getting costs under control, but that payment system reform (e.g., whether the government or private insurers process payments) is considerably less important yet gathers a disproportionate share of attention. Gawande argued that dramatic improvements and savings in the delivery system will take "at least a decade." He recommended changes that address the over-utilization of healthcare; the refocusing of incentives on value rather than profits; and comparative analysis of the cost of treatment across various healthcare providers to identify best practices. He argued this would be an iterative, empirical process and should be administered by a "national institute for healthcare delivery" to analyze and communicate improvement opportunities.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gawande |first=Atul |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_gawande |title=The New Yorker-The Cost Conundrum-June 2009 |publisher=Newyorker.com |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report published by the [[Commonwealth Fund]] in December 2007 examined 15 federal policy options and concluded that, taken together, they had the potential to reduce future increases in health care spending by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years.  These options included increased use of health information technology, research and incentives to improve medical decision making, reduced tobacco use and obesity, reforming the payment of providers to encourage efficiency, limiting the tax federal exemption for health insurance premiums, and reforming several market changes such as resetting the benchmark rates for Medicare Advantage plans and allowing the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices.  The authors based their modeling on the effect of combining these changes with the implementation of universal coverage.  The authors concluded that there are no magic bullets for controlling health care costs, and that a multifaceted approach will be needed to achieve meaningful progress.&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Schoen, Stuart Guterman, Anthony Shih, Jennifer Lau, Sophie Kasimow, Anne Gauthier, and Karen Davis, [http://www.commonwealthfund.org/usr_doc/Schoen_bendingthecurve_1080.pdf?section=4039 "Bending the Curve: Options for Achieving Savings and Improving Value in the U.S. Health Spending"] [[Commonwealth Fund]], December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During February 2010, President Obama updated his reform proposal, with modifications to the bills that had passed as of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/summary-presidents-proposal.pdf |title=President Obama's Plan – February 2010-Whitehouse Website |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost overview==
[[File:US healthcare cost panel v1.png|thumb|300px|right|U.S. healthcare cost information, including rate of change, per-capita, and percent of GDP.]]

Health spending accounted for 17.6% of GDP in the United States in 2010, down slightly from 2009 (17.7%) and by far the highest share in the OECD, and a full eight percentage points higher than the OECD average of 9.5%. Following the United States were the Netherlands (at 12.0% of GDP), and France and Germany (both at 11.6% of GDP). The United States spent $8,233 on health per capita in 2010, two-and-a-half times more than the OECD average of $3,268 (adjusted for purchasing power parity). Following the United States were Norway and Switzerland which spent over $5,250 per capita. Americans spent more than twice as much as relatively rich European countries such as France, Sweden and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/2/38980580.pdf OECD-Health Data 2012-How Does the United States Compare-June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/30/0,3746,en_2649_37407_12968734_1_1_1_37407,00.html OECD Health Data 2012-June 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413113002/http://www.oecd.org/document/30/0%2C3746%2Cen_2649_37407_12968734_1_1_1_37407%2C00.html |date=April 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual rate of cost increases slowed during 2010 and 2011. The causes are disputed, ranging from recession-related delays in visiting doctors to more long-term trends in moderating insurance premiums and reduced spending on structures and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/10/health-care-spending-slowdown-choose-your-own-adventure-edition/ Washington Post-Sarah Kliff-Healthcare spending slowdown-August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported in 2013 that the rate of increase in annual healthcare costs has fallen since 2002. However, costs per capita continue to rise. Per capita cost increases have averaged 5.4% annually since 2000. Costs relative to GDP have risen from 13.8% in 2000 to 17.9% by 2009, but remained at that level in 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical.html Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-Statistics, Trends and Reports-Retrieved June 9, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have attempted to explain the reduction in the rate of annual increase. Reasons include, among others: 
*Higher unemployment due to the 2008-2012 recession, which has limited the ability of consumers to purchase healthcare;
*Rising out-of-pocket payments;
*Deductibles (the amount a person pays before insurance begins to cover claims) have risen sharply. Workers must pay a larger share of their own health costs, and generally forces them to spend less; and
*The proportion of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance enrolled in a plan that required a deductible climbed to about three-quarters in 2012 from about half in 2006.&lt;ref name="NYTLowrey1"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Annie Lowrey |date=May 2013 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/business/slowdown-in-rise-of-health-care-costs-may-persist.html| title = Slowdown in Rise of Healthcare Costs May Persist | journal = [[The New York Times]]| accessdate = June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NROLevin1"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Yuval Levin |date=May 2013 | url = http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/349295/health-costs-and-budget| title = Healthcare Costs and Budget | journal = [[National Review Online]]| accessdate = June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing healthcare costs also contribute to wage stagnation, as corporations pay for benefits rather than wages. Bloomberg reported in January 2013: "If there’s a consensus among health economists about anything, it’s that employer-provided health benefits come out of wages. If health insurance were cheaper, or the marketplace were structured so that most people bought health coverage for themselves rather than getting it with their jobs, people would be paid more and raises would be higher."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/what-republicans-misunderstand-about-health-care-costs.html Bloomberg-Rammesh Ponurru-What Republicans Misunderstand About Healthcare Costs-January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Best practices==

===Independent advisory panels===
President Obama has proposed an "Independent Medicare Advisory Panel" (IMAC) to make recommendations on Medicare reimbursement policy and other reforms. Comparative effectiveness research would be one of many tools used by the IMAC. The IMAC concept was endorsed in a letter from several prominent healthcare policy experts, as summarized by OMB Director Peter Orszag:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peter Orszag, Director |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/blog/09/08/04/AnotherlookatIMAC/ |title=OMB Director Orszag-IMAC |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=August 4, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504045040/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/blog/09/08/04/AnotherlookatIMAC |archivedate=May 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Their support of the IMAC proposal underscores what most serious health analysts have recognized for some time: that moving toward a health system emphasizing quality rather than quantity will require continual effort, and that a key objective of legislation should be to put in place structures (like the IMAC) that facilitate such change over time. And ultimately, without a structure in place to help contain health care costs over the long term as the health market evolves, nothing else we do in fiscal policy will matter much, because eventually rising health care costs will overwhelm the federal budget.}}

Both Mayo Clinic CEO Dr. Denis Cortese and Surgeon/Author Atul Gawande have argued that such panel(s) will be critical to reform of the delivery system and improving value. Washington Post columnist [[David Ignatius]] has also recommended that President Obama engage someone like Cortese to have a more active role in driving reform efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/19/AR2009081902261.html |title=Washington Post-Paging Dr. Reform-August 2009 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |first=David |last=Ignatius |date=August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative effectiveness research===
[[File:Medicare spending per capita.png|thumb|Medicare spending per person varied significantly across states in 2006]]
[[Overutilization]] refers to when a patient overuses a doctor or to a doctor ordering more tests or services than may be required to address a particular condition effectively. Several treatment alternatives may be available for a given medical condition, with significantly different costs yet no statistical difference in outcome. Such scenarios offer the opportunity to maintain or improve the quality of care, while significantly reducing costs, through comparative effectiveness research. According to economist [[Peter A. Diamond]] and research cited by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO), the cost of healthcare per person in the U.S. also varies significantly by geography and medical center, with little or no statistical difference in outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/93xx/doc9317/05-29-NASI_Speech.pdf |title=Peter Diamond-Healthcare and Behavioral Economics-May 2008 |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparative effectiveness research has shown that significant cost reductions are possible. Former [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] Director [[Peter Orszag]] stated: "Nearly thirty percent of Medicare's costs could be saved without negatively affecting health outcomes if spending in high- and medium-cost areas could be reduced to the level of low-cost areas."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

===Pilot programs===
Gawande wrote that Obamacare contains a variety of pilot programs that may have a significant impact on cost and quality over the long-run, although these have not been factored into CBO cost estimates. He stated these pilot programs cover nearly every idea healthcare experts advocate, except malpractice/tort reform. He described how the U.S. faced a cost problem with agriculture, with nearly 40% of household disposable income absorbed by food costs in 1900. With a central oversight panel (the U.S.D.A.) and many pilot programs, the U.S. was able to vastly improve the productivity of its food production and reduce these costs over time. He wrote:

{{quote|Medicare and Medicaid currently pay clinicians the same amount regardless of results. But there is a pilot program to increase payments for doctors who deliver high-quality care at lower cost, while reducing payments for those who deliver low-quality care at higher cost. There’s a program that would pay bonuses to hospitals that improve patient results after heart failure, pneumonia, and surgery. There’s a program that would impose financial penalties on institutions with high rates of infections transmitted by health-care workers. Still another would test a system of penalties and rewards scaled to the quality of home health and rehabilitation care. Other experiments try moving medicine away from fee-for-service payment altogether. A bundled-payment provision would pay medical teams just one thirty-day fee for all the outpatient and inpatient services related to, say, an operation. This would give clinicians an incentive to work together to smooth care and reduce complications. One pilot would go even further, encouraging clinicians to band together into “Accountable Care Organizations” that take responsibility for all their patients’ needs, including prevention—so that fewer patients need operations in the first place. These groups would be permitted to keep part of the savings they generate, as long as they meet quality and service thresholds. The bill has ideas for changes in other parts of the system, too. Some provisions attempt to improve efficiency through administrative reforms, by, for example, requiring insurance companies to create a single standardized form for insurance reimbursement, to alleviate the clerical burden on clinicians. There are tests of various kinds of community wellness programs. The legislation also continues a stimulus-package program that funds comparative-effectiveness research—testing existing treatments for a condition against one another—because fewer treatment failures should mean lower costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gawande |first=Atul |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/12/14/091214fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all |title=Gawande-Testing, Testing-New Yorker-December 2009 |publisher=Newyorker.com |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Preventive strategies===
Increased use of preventive care (e.g., regular doctor visits) is one way of reducing health care spending. Official budget scores of [[universal health care]] proposals state that most of its savings would be from providing preventative care to the uninsured.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for a National Health Program (2008) [http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single_payer_system_cost.php?page=all "Single Payer System Cost?"] ''PNHP.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian physicians, who provide universal health care including preventative care, found that they could lower their total health care expenditures by 40% simply by increasing appropriate and reducing inappropriate preventative care measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-5-20 | last1 = Hogg | first1 = W. | last2 = Baskerville | year = 2005 | first2 = N | last3 = Lemelin | first3 = J | title = Cost savings associated with improving appropriate and reducing inappropriate preventive care: cost-consequences analysis | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 5 | issue = 1| page = 20 | pmid = 15755330 | pmc = 1079830 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A single uninsured cancer patient diagnosed at [[Cancer staging|stage four]] can incur over half a million dollars in hospital bills in a few months, which must be borne by all other health care consumers, when the same diagnosis at stage one with [[cancer screening|preventative screening]] would cost much less.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Kristof (October 17, 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/opinion/kristof-scotts-story-and-the-election.html "Scott’s Story and the Election"] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; However, preventive care is typically provided to many people who would never become ill, and for those who would have become ill, it is partially offset by the health care costs during additional years of life.&lt;ref&gt;David Brown, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/04/AR2008040403803.html?hpid=smartliving&amp;sid=ST2008040601449 "In the Balance: Some Candidates Disagree, but Studies Show It's Often Cheaper To Let People Get Sick,"] [[The Washington Post]], April 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Preventing obesity and overweight conditions presents a significant opportunity to reduce costs. The [[Centers for Disease Control]] reported that approximately 9% of healthcare costs in 1998 were attributable to overweight and obesity, or as much as $92.6 billion in 2002 dollars. Nearly half of these costs were paid for by the government via Medicare or Medicaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/causes/economics.html |title=CDC Home Page-Economic Consequences of Overweight and Obesity-Retrieved October 6, 2009 |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2008 the CDC estimated these costs had nearly doubled to $147 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mckay |first=Betsy |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204563304574314794089897258 |title=WSJ-Cost of Treating Obesity Soars-July 28, 2009 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=July 28, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC identified a series of expensive conditions more likely to occur due to obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/causes/health.html |title=CDC Home Page-Health Consequences of Obesity and Overweight-Retrieved October 6, 2009 |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC released a series of strategies to prevent obesity and overweight, including: making healthy foods and beverages more available; supporting healthy food choices; encouraging kids to be more active; and creating safe communities to support physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20090727/obestiy-costs-us-147-billion-dollars-a-year |title=WebMD-Retrieved October 6, 2009-Obesity Costs U.S. $147 billion per year |publisher=Webmd.com |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5807a1.htm |title=CDC-Recommended Community Strategies and Measurements to Prevent Obesity in the U.S.- July 24, 2009 |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 25.6% of U.S. adults in 2007 were obese, versus 23.9% in 2005.

This is an estimated $2,400 per obese person. The study was performed by researchers at Cornell and Emory universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stobbe |first=Mike |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39693316/ns/health-diet_and_nutrition |title=CNN-Obesity Care May Cost Twice Previous Estimates-October 15, 2010 |publisher=MSNBC |date=October 15, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in contrast to yearly costs, lifetime costs can be highest among healthy people, who live longer. One study in the Netherlands indicated that: "Until the age of 56, yearly health costs were highest for obese people and lowest for healthy-living people. At older ages, the highest yearly costs were incurred by the smoking group. However, because of differences in life expectancy (life expectancy at age 20 was 5 years less for the obese group, and 8 years less for the smoking group, compared to the healthy-living group), total lifetime health spending was greatest for the healthy-living people, lowest for the smokers, and intermediate for the obese people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2225430 | pmid=18254654 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050029 | volume=5 | title=Lifetime medical costs of obesity: prevention no cure for increasing health expenditure | date=February 2008 | journal=PLoS Med. | pages=e29 | author=van Baal PH, Polder JJ, de Wit GA ''et al.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eliminate unnecessary tests===
During April 2012, nine physician groups identified 45 tests that were commonly used but that provided no proven benefits to patients or could actually be harmful. This was done at the urging of a Dr. Howard Brody, who published this recommendation in a 2010 article. The nine groups (medical societies) developed the lists after months of analyses and reviews of the medical literature by expert committees. The ''New York Times'' editorial board wrote: "Eliminating needless care is not rationing. It is sound medicine and sound economics."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/09/opinion/do-you-really-need-that-medical-test.html?ref=opinion NYT-Do You Need that Test? April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

One July 2012 proposal advocated that consumers of healthcare always have "skin in the game" such that their costs rise as more services are provided.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Address expensive chronic cases===
The CBO reported in May 2005: "Medicare spending is highly concentrated, with a small number of beneficiaries accounting for a large proportion of the Medicare program's annual expenditures. In 2001, the costliest 5 percent of beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare's fee-for-service (FFS) sector accounted for 43 percent of total spending, while the costliest 25 percent...accounted for fully 85 percent of spending...These high-cost beneficiaries, compared with beneficiaries in the bottom 75 percent in terms of their spending, were slightly older, more likely to suffer from chronic conditions, such as coronary artery disease and diabetes, and more likely to die in a given year." 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=6332&amp;type=0 |title=CBO-High Cost Medicare Beneficiaries-2005 |publisher=Cbo.gov |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such concentration offers opportunities to focus on key ailments and treatment approaches. Peter Orszag wrote in May 2011: "The truth is that constraining future health care costs will require a variety of approaches, but in particular it will mean improving the information that providers have about their patients and best practices, and the incentives that providers are given to deliver better care, especially in expensive cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bratton |first=William J. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-25/sharing-costs-is-no-way-to-fix-medicare.html |title=Bloomberg-Orszag-Cost Sharing is No Way to Fix Medicare-May 2011 |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |date=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market-based solutions==

===Privatize Medicare with a voucher system===
Rep. [[Paul Ryan (politician)|Paul Ryan]] (R) has proposed the ''Roadmap for America's Future'', which is a series of budgetary reforms. His January 2010 version of the plan includes the transition of Medicare to a voucher system, meaning individuals would receive a voucher which could be used to purchase health insurance in the private market. This would not affect those near retirement or currently enrolled in Medicare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/ |title=Republican Website-Roadmap for America's Future |publisher=Roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov |date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130103958/http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/ |archivedate=January 30, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of graphs and charts summarizing the impact of the plan are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/plan/charts.htm |title=Roadmap for America's Future-Charts &amp; Graphs-February 2010 |publisher=Roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219200328/http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/Plan/Charts.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists have both praised and criticized particular features of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/12/AR2010021202382.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 |title=Washington Post-Robert Samuelson-Paul Ryan's Lonely Challenge-February 2010 |work=The Washington Post |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/11/cut-spending-taxes-budget-medicare-paul-ryan-opinions-columnists-bruce-bartlett.html |title=Forbes-Bartlett-Paul Ryan's Budgetary Holy Grail-February 2010 |work=Forbes |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |date=February 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBO also partially scored the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10851/01-27-Ryan-Roadmap-Letter.pdf |title=CBO-Ryan Roadmap Letter-January 2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicaid recipients could also be provided with tax credits or subsidies to purchase their own private insurance, reducing incentives for them to remain in the program.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/opinion/brooks-a-choice-not-a-whine.html NYT-David Brooks-A Choice, Not a Whine-July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurance company antitrust reforms===
Some conservatives advocate free market reforms such as breaking up state monopolies on insurance and licensing and allowing consumers to purchase health insurance licensed by other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10646 |title=Cato-A Free Market can fix healthcare |publisher=Cato.org |date=October 21, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-gingrich16-2009aug16,0,3301006.story |title=Newt Gingrich-LAT Times-Healthcare Rationing-Real Scary-August 2009 |work=Los Angeles Times  |date=August 16, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[GAO]] reported in 2002 (using 2000 data) the following statistics regarding insurance competition in state markets: "The [[median]] number of licensed carriers in the small group market per state was 28, with a range from 4 in Hawaii to 77 in Indiana. The median market share of the largest carrier was about 33 percent, with a range from about 14 percent in Texas to about 89 percent in North Dakota.

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] argued that allowing interstate competition would create a "race to the bottom," in which "[t]he states with the weakest regulations – for example, those that allow insurance companies to deny coverage to victims of domestic violence – would set the standards for the nation as a whole. The result would be to afflict the afflicted, to make the lives of Americans with pre-existing conditions even harder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krugman |first=Paul |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/opinion/26krugman.html |title=Paul Krugman-Afflicting the Afflicted-February 25, 2010 |work=The New York Times |date=February 25, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform of doctor's incentives===
Critics have argued that the healthcare system has several incentives that drive costly behavior. Two of these include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leonhardt |first=David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/business/economy/08leonhardt.html |title=NYT-Leonhardt-In Health Reform, A Cancer Offers and Acid Test-July 2009 |work=The New York Times |date=July 7, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Doctors are typically paid for services provided rather than with a salary. This provides a financial incentive to increase the costs of treatment provided.
#Patients that are fully insured have no financial incentive to minimize the cost when choosing among alternatives. The overall effect is to increase insurance premiums for all.

Gawande argued: "Our fee-for-service system, doling out separate payments for everything and everyone involved in a patient’s care, has all the wrong incentives: it rewards doing more over doing right, it increases paperwork and the duplication of efforts, and it discourages clinicians from working together for the best possible results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gawande |first=Atul |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/12/14/091214fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all |title=Atul Gawande – Testing, Testing-New Yorker-December 2009 |publisher=Newyorker.com |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gawande quoted one surgeon who stated: "We took a wrong turn when doctors stopped being doctors and became businessmen." Gawande identified various revenue-enhancing approaches and profit-based incentives that doctors were using in high-cost areas that may have caused the over-utilization of healthcare. He contrasted this with lower-cost areas that used salaried doctors and other techniques to reward value, referring to this as a "battle for the soul of American medicine."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

One option involves an integrated series of healthcare providers charging a premium or flat fee to patients to participate in the network, rather than a fee for each individual service. This modifies the doctor's incentive from ordering more services to solving the problem efficiently (i.e., more care to more cost-efficient care). The provider network would also purchase insurance for catastrophic (extremely high cost) cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/05/whats-bloated-broken-and-killing-our-economy/256765/The Atlantic-Philip K.

===Medical malpractice liability costs and tort reform===
{{Very long|section|date=November 2009}}

Critics have argued that [[medical malpractice]] costs (insurance and lawsuits, for example) are significant and should be addressed via [[tort reform]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2009/08/06/the_high_cost_of_medical_malpractice_97346.html Realclearmarkets.com] RCP-Roth-The High Cost of Medical Malpractice-August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

How much these costs are is a matter of debate. Some{{Who|date=November 2010}} have argued that [[malpractice]] lawsuits are a major driver of medical costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073002816.html|title=Health Reform's Taboo Topic|author=Philip K. Howard|date=July 31, 2009 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 study estimated the cost around 0.2%, and in 2009 insurer WellPoint Inc. said "liability wasn’t driving premiums."&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nussbaum |first=Alex |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=az9qxQZNmf0o |title=Bloomberg-Malpractice Lawsuits are Red Herring in Obama Plan |publisher=Bloomberg |date=June 16, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2006 study found neurologists in the United States ordered more tests in theoretical clinical situations posed than their German counterparts; U.S. clinicians are more likely to fear litigation which may be due to the teaching of defensive strategies which are reported more often in U.S. teaching programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Roland Brilla |author2=Stefan Evers |author3=Angela Deutschländer |author4=Katja Elfriede Wartenberg |year=2006 |title=Are neurology residents in the United States being taught defensive medicine? |journal=[[Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery]] |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=374–377 |doi=10.1016/j.clineuro.2005.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counting both direct and indirect costs, other studies estimate the total cost of malpractice "is linked to" between 5% and 10% of total U.S. medical costs.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"/&gt;

A 2004 report by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] put medical malpractice costs at 2 percent of U.S. health spending and "even significant reductions" would do little to reduce the growth of health care expenses.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"/&gt; A 2009 CBO report estimated that approximately $54 billion could be saved over ten years by limiting medical malpractice lawsuits. A tort reform package that includes caps on jury awards of $500,000 for punitive damages and $250,000 for "pain and suffering" damages would lower liability insurance premiums by about 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/10/12/tort.reform/index.html |title=CNN-Tort reform could save $54 billion,CBO Report Says-Oct 9 |publisher=CNN |date=October 12, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, physician and former Democratic National Committee Chairman [[Howard Dean]] explained why tort reform was omitted from the Congressional health care reform bills then under consideration: "When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that, the more stuff you put in it, the more enemies you make, right?...And the reason tort reform is not on the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on. That is the plain and simple truth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/08/27/roundtable_on_health_care_reforms_costs_98082.html Realclearpolitics.com] RCP-Roundtable on Health Reform Costs-August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaMj-WUC-aE |title=YouTube.com |work=YouTube |date=August 26, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that even successful tort reform might not lead to lower aggregate liability.  For example, the current contingent fee system skews litigation towards high-value cases while ignoring meritorious small cases; aligning litigation more closely with merit might thus increase the number of small awards, offsetting any reduction in large awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/503853 |title=Medscape.com |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A New York study found that only 1.5% of hospital negligence led to claims; moreover, the CBO observed that "health care providers are generally not exposed to the financial cost of their own malpractice risk because they carry liability insurance, and the premiums for that insurance do not reflect the records or practice styles of individual providers but more-general factors such as location and medical specialty."&lt;ref name="cbo.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4968&amp;type=0 |title=CBO.gov |publisher=CBO.gov |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that total liability is small relative to the amount doctors pay in malpractice insurance premiums, alternative mechanisms have been proposed to reform malpractice insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physiciansnews.com/law/1202roggenbaum.html |title=Physiciansnews.com |publisher=Physiciansnews.com |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the CBO studied restrictions on malpractice awards proposed by the [[George W. Bush]] Administration and members of Congress; CBO concluded that "the evidence available to date does not make a strong case that restricting malpractice liability would have a significant effect, either positive or negative, on economic efficiency."&lt;ref name="cbo.gov"/&gt;  Empirical data and reporting have since shown that some of the highest medical costs are now in states where tort reform had already caused malpractice premiums and lawsuits to drop substantially; unnecessary and injurious procedures are instead caused by a system "often driven to maximize revenues over patient needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gawande |first=Atul |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2009/06/atul-gawande-the-cost-conundrum-redux.html |title=NewYorker.com |publisher=NewYorker.com |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gawande |first=Atul |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_gawande |title=NewYorker.com |publisher=NewYorker.com |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/07/17/60minutes/main563755.shtml |title=CBSNews.com |publisher=CBSNews.com |date=March 5, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One option proposed includes specialized healthcare courts rather than the jury system. Such courts exist in other disciplines. In administrative health courts, an expert judge would decide cases based on best medical practice, writing an opinion that is subject to appeal to an appellate health court. There would also be a requirement of full disclosure by hospitals, and all facts would be fed back into the health care system so providers learn from their mistakes. Such an approach has been opposed by trial lawyer lobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/05/whats-bloated-broken-and-killing-our-economy/256765/ The Atlantic-Beyond Obamacare: How to Fix Our Enormous, Inefficient Health-Care System-Philip K. Howard-May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addressing the shortage of doctors and nurses===
The U.S. is facing shortages of doctors and nurses that are projected to grow worse as America ages, which may drive up the price of these services. Writing in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', cardiologist Arthur Feldman cited various studies that indicate the U.S. is facing a "critical" shortage of doctors, including an estimated 1,300 general surgeons by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/04/AR2009090402274.html|title=Feldman-Washington Post-Ten Things I Hate About Healthcare Reform-Sept 09 | work=The Washington Post | date=September 6, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Academy of Family Physicians predicts a shortage of 40,000 primary care doctors (including family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics/gynecology) by 2020. The number of medical students choosing the primary care specialty has dropped by 52% since 1997. Currently, only 2% of medical school graduates choose primary care as a career. An amendment to the Senate health bill includes $2 billion in funds over 10 years to create 2,000 new residency training slots geared toward primary care medicine and general surgery. Writing in Forbes, a physician argued that this is a "tiny band-aid at best," advocating full loan repayments and guaranteed positions upon graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/12/04/doctors-medical-health-reform-senate-opinions-contributors-marc-siegel.html |title=Forbes-The Doctor Drought-Marc Siegel-December 2009 |work=Forbes |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |date=December 4, 2009 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123083057/http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/04/doctors-medical-health-reform-senate-opinions-contributors-marc-siegel.html |archivedate=January 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicians wrote a NYT Op Ed in May 2011 stating that doctors typically graduate with an average of $155,000 in debt from Medical school, with over 80% owing debt of some type. This drives some doctors into higher paying specialties as opposed to primary care. As specialists, they prescribe more expensive treatments. About $2.5 billion/year would be required to make Medical school free, which the writers estimated at one-thousandth the total annual healthcare costs. Making medical school free would help address the shortage in their view.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/opinion/29bach.html Why Medical School Should be Free-NYT-]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. had 2.3 doctors per 1,000 people in 2002, ranking 52nd. Germany and France had approximately 3.4 and ranked in the top 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_phy_per_1000_peo-physicians-per-1-000-people NationMaster.com-Retrieved December 4, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The OECD average in 2008 was 3.1 doctors per 1,000 people, while the U.S. had 2.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/02/health-care-costs-opinions-columnists-reform.html |title=Forbes-Bruce Bartlett-Health Care Costs &amp; Reform-July 2009 |work=Forbes |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |date=July 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Association of Colleges of Nurses cited studies estimating that a shortage of registered nurses would reach 230,000 by 2025 as America ages, with over 135,000 open positions during 2007. An additional 30% more nurses would have to graduate annually to keep up with demand. A study by Price Waterhouse advanced several strategies for addressing the nursing shortage, including developing more public-private partnerships, federal and state-level grants for nursing students and educators, creating healthy work environments, using technology as a training tool, and designing more flexible roles for advanced practice nurses given their increased use as primary care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacn.nche.edu/Media/FactSheets/NursingShortage.htm|title=American Association of Colleges of Nurses-Fact Sheet-Retrieved September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote: "Lately, some policymakers have argued that instead of having a primary-care doctor, more people—especially young, healthy patients with simple medical needs—should see a nurse or physician assistant who administers routine care and kicks more complex problems up to a doctor when they arise. 'If you're just coming in to have your blood pressure checked and your pulse taken, you really don't need to see a doctor, and you might not need to see a nurse, either,' says David Barrett, president and CEO of the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass. "There are three-stripe military sergeants with two-year degrees who can provide excellent primary care. There's absolutely no reason to force all primary-care providers to have an M.D."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mary Carmichael |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/234218?from=rss |title=Newsweek-The Doctor Won't See You Now-February 2010 |work=Newsweek |date=February 25, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax reform==
[[File:Compensation - Gross and Net of Health Insurance Premiums.png|thumb|Health insurance premiums paid on behalf of workers are increasingly offsetting compensation]]

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] has described how the tax treatment of insurance premiums may affect behavior:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/93xx/doc9385/06-17-LTBO_Testimony.pdf |title=Long-Term Budget Outlook and Options for Slowing the Growth of Health Care Costs |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|One factor perpetuating inefficiencies in health care is a lack of clarity regarding the cost of health insurance and who bears that cost, especially employment-based health insurance. Employers’ payments for employment-based health insurance and nearly all payments by employees for that insurance are excluded from individual income and payroll taxes. Although both theory and evidence suggest that workers ultimately finance their employment-based insurance through lower take-home pay, the cost is not evident to many workers...If transparency increases and workers see how much their income is being reduced for employers’contributions and what those contributions are paying for, there might be a broader change in cost-consciousness that shifts demand.}}

[[Peter Singer]] wrote in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that the current exclusion of insurance premiums from compensation represents a $200 billion subsidy for the private insurance industry and that it would likely not exist without it.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Singer |first=Peter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19healthcare-t.html |title=NYT-Singer-Why We Must Ration Healthcare-July 15, 2009 |work=The New York Times |date=July 19, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, [[The Economist]] estimated that taxing employer-provided health insurance (which is presently exempt from tax) would add $215 billion per year to federal tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14903024 |title=The Economist-Stemming the Tide-November 2009 |work=The Economist  |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |date=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employer-provided health insurance receives uncapped tax benefits. According to the OECD, it "encourages the purchase of more generous insurance plans, notably plans with little cost sharing, thus exacerbating moral hazard".&lt;ref name="oecdhealthreform2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/51/0,3343,en_2649_34117_41809843_1_1_1_1,00.html|title=Economic Survey of the United States 2008: Health Care Reform|publisher=OECD|date=December 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers want unfettered access to medical services; they also prefer to pay through insurance or tax rather than out of pocket.

The researchers found that only 3.7% of the variation in the cost of family coverage in employer-sponsored health plans is attributable to differences in the actuarial value of benefits.  Only 6.1% of the variation is attributable to the combination of benefit design and plan type (e.g., PPO, HMO, etc.).  The employer's industry and regional variations in health care cost explain part of the variation, but most is unexplained.  The researchers conclude ". . . that analysts should not equate high-cost plans with Cadillac plans, . . . [w]ithout appropriate adjustments, a simple cap may exacerbate rather than ameliorate current inequities"&lt;ref&gt;Jon Gabel, Jeremy Pickreign, Roland McDevitt, and Thomas Briggs, [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstract/hlthaff.2008.0430 "Taxing Cadillac Health Plans May Produce Chevy Results,"] ''[[Health Affairs]]'', web exclusive, Published online December 3, 2009, {{doi|10.1377/hlthaff.2008.0430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Premium tax subsidies to help individuals purchase their own health insurance have also been suggested as a way to increase coverage rates. Research confirms that consumers in the individual health insurance market are sensitive to price. It appears that price sensitivity varies among population subgroups and is generally higher for younger individuals and lower income individuals. However, research also suggests that subsidies alone are unlikely to solve the uninsured problem in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/66xx/doc6620/08-24-HealthInsurance.pdf "The Price Sensitivity of Demand for Nongroup Health Insurance,"] [[Congressional Budget Office]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

The program pays out over $430 billion per year via over 1 billion claims, making enforcement challenging.&lt;ref name="Rosen &amp; Bach 10-25-2009"/&gt; Its enforcement budget is "extremely limited" according to one Medicare official. U.S. Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] said in an interview: "Clearly more auditing needs to be done and it needs to be done in real time."&lt;ref name="Rosen &amp; Bach 10-25-2009"/&gt;  The Obama administration is providing Medicare with an additional $200 million to fight fraud as part of its stimulus package, and billions of dollars to computerize medical records and upgrade networks, which should assist Medicare in identifying fraudulent claims.&lt;ref name="Rosen &amp; Bach 10-25-2009"&gt;Ira Rosen and Joel Bach, producers, [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/23/60minutes/main5414390.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody CBS-60 Minutes-Medicare Fraud-A $60 Trillion Business], [[CBS News]], October 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

During July 2010, President Obama signed into law the [[Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010]], citing approximately $110 billion in unauthorized payments of all types, including Medicare and Medicaid.  President Obama has directed his administration to reduce these payments by $50 million annually by 2012, less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Katelyn Sabochik |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/07/22/improper-payments-elimination-and-recovery-act-cutting-waste-and-fraud-government |title=Whitehouse-Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=July 22, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coverage mandates===
{{Main|Health insurance mandate}}
Reforming or restructuring the private health insurance market is often suggested as a means for achieving health care reform in the U.S. Insurance market reform has the potential to increase the number of Americans with insurance, but is unlikely to significantly reduce the rate of growth in health care spending.&lt;ref name="Blumberg &amp; Nichols 1995"/&gt;  Careful consideration of basic insurance principles is important when considering insurance market reform, in order to avoid unanticipated consequences and ensure the long-term viability of the reformed system.&lt;ref&gt;Uninsured Work Group, [http://www.actuary.org/pdf/health/coverage_ib_08.pdf 'Fundamentals of Insurance: Implications for Health Coverage,"] ''Issue Brief'', [[American Academy of Actuaries]], July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  According to one study conducted by the [[Urban Institute]], if not implemented on a systematic basis with appropriate safeguards, market reform has the potential to cause more problems than it solves.&lt;ref name="Blumberg &amp; Nichols 1995"&gt;Linda J. Blumberg and Len Nichols, [http://www.urban.org/publications/306448.html "Health Insurance Market Reforms: What They Can and Cannot Do,"] [[Urban Institute]], November 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Since most Americans with private coverage receive it through employer-sponsored plans, many have suggested employer "pay or play" requirements as a way to increase coverage levels (i.e., employers that do not provide insurance would have to pay a tax instead).  However, research suggests that current pay or play proposals are limited in their ability to increase coverage among the working poor. These proposals generally exclude small firms, do not distinguish between individuals who have access to other forms of coverage and those who do not, and increase the overall compensation costs to employers.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Burkhauser and [[Kosali Simon]], [http://epionline.org/downloads/BurkhauserSimon.pdf "The Economics of "Pay or Play" Employer Mandates: Who Gets What From Employer "Pay or Play" Mandates,"] Employment Policies Institute, November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009 the [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] reported that while requirements to purchase health insurance were central to proposals in both the House and Senate, these coverage mandates were "under fire from both ends of the political spectrum, with some liberals saying the penalties are too harsh for those who refuse and conservatives denouncing the whole concept."&lt;ref name="Adamy and Hitt October 10, 2009"&gt;Janet Adamy and Greg Hitt, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125512846770976969 "Insurance Mandates Draw Flak From Both Sides,"] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', October 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the article, however, "[h]ealth-policy experts . . .say there is a good reason for the mandate."&lt;ref name="Adamy and Hitt October 10, 2009"/&gt;  Proposed reforms would prohibit health insurers from denying coverage to individuals with pre-existing medical conditions.&lt;ref name="Adamy and Hitt October 10, 2009"/&gt; Insurers said that, to keep premiums from rising for everyone, it is necessary for healthier people to pay into the insurance pools to balance out the cost of these higher cost individuals.&lt;ref name="Adamy and Hitt October 10, 2009"/&gt;

Arguing against requiring individuals to buy coverage, the [[Cato Institute]] has asserted that the Massachusetts law forcing everyone to buy insurance has increased costs: "Premiums are growing 21 to 46 percent faster than the national average, in part because Massachusetts' individual mandate has effectively outlawed affordable health plans."&lt;ref name="Cannon 08-27-2009"&gt;Michael F. Cannon, [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10488 ''Massachusetts' Obama-like Reforms Increase Health Costs, Wait Times'',] [[Cato Institute]], Reprint of article that appeared in the [[Detroit News]] on August 27, 2009 (accessed October 16, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  They say that "the mandate gives politicians enormous power to dictate the content of every American's health plan – a power that health care providers inevitably capture and use to increase the required level of insurance" and state that providers were successful in persuading legislators to include an additional 16 benefit mandates in the required benefit package during the first three years after the coverage mandate was enacted.&lt;ref name="Cannon 08-27-2009"/&gt;  They also say that by prohibiting the use of health status in pricing, the Massachusetts law "further increase[s] premiums for the young and healthy" and, as the result of [[adverse selection]], drives more comprehensive health plans out of the market.&lt;ref name="Cannon 08-27-2009"/&gt;  The conclusion they draw is that "[T]he most sweeping provision . . . is an 'individual mandate' that makes health insurance compulsory. Massachusetts shows that such a mandate would oust millions from their low-cost health plans and force them to pay higher premiums."&lt;ref name="Cannon 08-27-2009"/&gt;

Writing in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] opinion blog "Room for Debate" the [[single-payer health care]] advocate [[Marcia Angell]], former editor-in-chief of the [[New England Journal of Medicine]], said that a coverage mandate would not be necessary within a single-payer system and that even within the context of current system she was "troubled by the notion of an individual mandate."&lt;ref name="roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com"/&gt; She described the Massachusetts mandates as "a windfall for the insurance industry" and wrote, "Premiums are rising much faster than income, benefit packages are getting skimpier, and deductibles and co-payments are going up."&lt;ref name="roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;The Editors, [http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/should-health-insurance-be-mandatory/ "Should Health Insurance Be Mandatory?,"] "Room for Debate" opinion blog, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009 [[the Boston Globe]] reported that the number of people seeking emergency room care and the cost of emergency room visits increased after the 2006 mandates went into effect (comparing 2005 to 2007).&lt;ref name="Kowalczyk 04-24-2009"&gt;Liz Kowalczyk, [http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/04/24/er_visits_costs_in_mass_climb/ "ER visits, costs in Mass. climb: Questions raised about healthcare law's impact on overuse,"] ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', April 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of visits increased by 7% during that period, while costs rose by 17%.&lt;ref name="Kowalczyk 04-24-2009"/&gt;  State officials cautioned that it was too early to determine if the state's new coverage mandate had failed to reduce the emergency room use, but several physicians and policymakers said that it was unlikely that a coverage mandate alone could solve the problems of emergency room crowding and overuse.&lt;ref name="Kowalczyk 04-24-2009"/&gt;  In August 2009 [[the Boston Globe]] reported that Massachusetts had "the most expensive family health insurance premiums in the country."&lt;ref name="Lazar 08-22-2009"/&gt;  Premiums in Massachusetts increased by 40 percent from 2003 to 2008, compared to a national average increase of 33%.&lt;ref name="Lazar 08-22-2009"/&gt; The report did not break out the amount of the increase since 2006, but as the Massachusetts reforms are often taken as a model for national reform, "advocates on various sides of the issue said the report underscores the urgency of including cost controls in any large-scale federal or state overhaul."&lt;ref name="Lazar 08-22-2009"&gt;Kay Lazar, [http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2009/08/22/bay_state_health_insurance_premiums_highest_in_country/ "Bay State health insurance premiums highest in country: Rein in health costs, Massachusetts urged,"] ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', August 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Karen Davenport, director of health policy at the [[Center for American Progress]], has argued that "before making coverage mandatory, we need to reform the health insurance market, strengthen public health insurance programs, and finance premium subsidies for people who can’t afford coverage on their own."&lt;ref name="roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com"/&gt;

Addressing the issue when it was proposed in 1994, [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] wrote: "A mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action. The government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/48xx/doc4816/doc38.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also disagreement as to whether federal mandates would be constitutional,&lt;ref name="Adamy and Hitt October 10, 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seelye |first=Katharine Q. |url=http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/the-right-the-duty-to-bear-insurance-cards/?ref=us |title=Nytimes.com |publisher=Prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com |date=September 26, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and state initiatives opposing federal mandates may lead to litigation and delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davey |first=Monica |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/us/29states.html?_r=1&amp;hp |title=Nytimes.com |work=The New York Times |date=September 28, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 2012, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the individual mandate provision as Constitutional.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Upholds The Health Care Law"&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court upholds individual mandate|url=http://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2012/06/28/supreme-court-upholds-individual-mandate/|accessdate=2012-06-28|date=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationing of care===
{{Main|Healthcare rationing in the United States}}
President [[Barack Obama]] argues that U.S. healthcare is rationed, based on income, type of employment, and pre-existing medical conditions, with nearly 46 million uninsured. He argues that millions of Americans are denied coverage or face higher premiums as a result of pre-existing medical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Obama |first=Barack |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/opinion/16obama.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=opinion |title=NYT-President Obama-Why We Need Healthcare Reform-August 15, 2009 |work=The New York Times |date=August 15, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Singer]] and [[David Leonhardt]] have each separately noted that health care rationing is not a choice, but an economic necessity. All health care resources are finite and have to be allocated in some way or other.  The issue is which way is the most sensible way to do it.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leonhardt |first=David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/business/economy/17leonhardt.html |title=NYT-Leonhardt-Healthcare Rationing Rhetoric Overlooks Reality-June 2009 |work=The New York Times |date=June 17, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Republican Secretary of Commerce [[Peter George Peterson|Peter G. Peterson]] has also argued that some form of rationing is inevitable and desirable considering the state of U.S. finances and the trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liabilities. He estimated that 25–33% of healthcare services are provided to those in the last months or year of life and advocated restrictions in cases where quality of life cannot be improved. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. All of these issues would be addressed under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10443 |title=Peter G. Peterson on Charlie Rose-July 3, 2009-About 17 min in |publisher=Charlierose.com |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319221641/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10443 |archivedate=March 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rationing by price means accepting that there is no triage according to need. Thus in the private sector it is accepted that some people get expensive surgeries such as liver transplants or non life-threatening ones such as cosmetic surgery, when others fail to get cheaper and much more cost effective care such as prenatal care, which could save the lives of many fetuses and newborn children. Some places, like Oregon for example, do explicitly ration Medicaid resources using medical priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elson |first=John |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957673,00.html |title=Time Magazine-Ethics: Rationing Medical Care-Sept 09 |work=Time |date=May 15, 1989 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians on the right tend to be fearful of democratically elected governments becoming involved in rationing decision. Former House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] (R-GA) argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he referred to as a type of healthcare rationing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-gingrich16-2009aug16,0,3301006.story |title=LA Times-Gingrich-Healthcare Rationing-Real Scary |work=Los Angeles Times  |date=August 16, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Charles Grassley]] (R-IA) makes similar arguments claiming for example that people like the late Senator Edward Kennedy received health care in the U.S. that would have been denied in countries which have government controlled health care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cummings |first=Jeanne |url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=43B49554-18FE-70B2-A812E6B1AD6D7D2E |title=Politico.com |publisher=Dyn.politico.com |date=August 22, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that ''The Economist'' magazine said was "dangerous" and went on to say that "The reality is that America, like Britain, already makes extensive use of rationing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14258877 |title=Economist.com |work=The Economist  |date=August 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Better usage of healthcare technology==

===Automation of patient records===
The [[Congressional Budget Office]] has concluded that increased use of health information technology has great potential to significantly reduce overall health care spending and realize large improvements in health care quality providing that the system is integrated. The use of health IT in an unintegrated setting will not realize all the projected savings.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. [[Congressional Budget Office]], [http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/91xx/doc9168/05-20-HealthIT.pdf "Evidence on the Costs and Benefits of Health Information Technology,"] Pub. No. 2976, May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment registries===
One application of healthcare technology is the creation of registries or databases to relate treatments to outcomes. Useful treatments could be identified and those less useful could be avoided to reduce costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-08/smart-health-care-strategy-hidden-in-cliff-deal.html Bloomberg-Peter Orszag-Smart Health-Care Strategy Hidden in ‘Cliff’ Deal-January 9, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Payment system reform===
{{Main|Single-payer healthcare}}

The payment system refers to the billing and payment for medical services, which is distinct from the delivery system through which the services are provided. The over 1,300 U.S. health insurance companies have different forms and processes for billing and reimbursement, requiring enormous costs on the part of service providers (mainly doctors and hospitals) to process payments. For example, the Cleveland Clinic, considered a low-cost, best-practices hospital system, has 1,400 billing clerks to support 2,000 doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/224585 |title=Newsweek-The Hospital That Could Cure Healthcare-December 7, 2009 |work=Newsweek |date=November 26, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the insurance companies have their own overhead functions and profit margins, much of which could be eliminated with a single payer system.  Economist Paul Krugman estimated in 2005 that converting from the current private insurance system to a single-payer system would enable $200 billion per year in cost savings, primarily via insurance company overhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krugman |first=Paul |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/opinion/13krugman.html |title=Krugman-One Nation, Uninsured-June 2005 |work=The New York Times |date=June 13, 2005 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One advocacy group estimated savings as high as $400 billion annually for 2009 and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single-payer-resources |title=PNHP-Single Payer |publisher=[[Physicians for a National Health Program]] |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of health care reform argue that moving to a single-payer system would reallocate the money currently spent on the administrative overhead required to run the hundreds&lt;ref&gt;The trade association [http://www.ahip.org AHIP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111040636/http://www.ahip.org/ |date=November 11, 2009 }}, America's Health Insurance Plans, has some 1,300 members.&lt;/ref&gt; of insurance companies in the U.S. to provide universal care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 "The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It"]
By Paul Krugman, [[Robin Wells (economist)|Robin Wells]], ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', March 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  An often-cited study by [[Harvard Medical School]] and the [[Canadian Institute for Health Information]] determined that some 31 percent of U.S. health care dollars, or more than $1,000 per person per year, went to health care administrative costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnhp.org/publications/nejmadmin.pdf Costs of Health Administration in the U.S. and Canada], Woolhandler, et al., NEJM 349(8) Sept. 21, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates are lower. One study of the billing and insurance-related (BIR) costs borne not only by insurers but also by physicians and hospitals found that BIR among insurers, physicians, and hospitals in California represented 20–22% of privately insured spending in California acute care settings.&lt;ref name="pmid16284038"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kahn JG, Kronick R, Kreger M, Gans DN |title=The cost of health insurance administration in California: estimates for insurers, physicians, and hospitals |journal=[[Health Aff (Millwood)]] |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=1629–39 |year=2005 |pmid=16284038 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.6.1629 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16284038 |accessdate=January 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of "single-payer" argue that shifting the U.S. to a single-payer health care system would provide universal coverage, give patients free choice of providers and hospitals, and guarantee comprehensive coverage and equal access for all medically necessary procedures, without increasing overall spending. Shifting to a single-payer system, by this view, would also eliminate oversight by managed care reviewers, restoring the traditional doctor-patient relationship.&lt;ref name="PNHP"&gt;Physicians for a National Health Program. [http://www.pnhp.org/facts/what_is_single_payer.php "What is Single Payer?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the organizations in support of single-payer health care in the U.S. is [[Physicians for a National Health Program]] (PNHP), an organization of some 17,000 American physicians, medical students, and health professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnhp.org/about/about_pnhp.php |title=PNHP.org |publisher=PNHP.org |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reduce costs of imaging technology===
During 2009, Medicare spent $11.7 billion for medical imaging, such as CT scans and MRI's. From 2005 to 2009, usage of scans grew at an annual rate of 14%, but may have slowed since due to a combination of changing incentives and saturation of usage. Initially, demanding patients insisted on scans; doctors feared malpractice suits if they refused; and doctors and hospitals wanted to maximize revenues. One study indicated that changing incentives may have reduced cost growth. From 2006 to 2010, the share of workers with deductibles exceeding $1,000 grew from 10 percent to 27 percent. Increased out-of-pocket expenses have made patients and physicians more cost conscious.  Further, a combination of prior notification, higher patient co-payments and restrained reimbursements may have contributed to slowing cost growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/curbing-the-costs-of-high-tech-health/2012/08/01/gJQAwPPMPX_story.html Washington Post-Samuelson-Curbing the Costs of High-Tech Health-July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
{{Main|Health care reform debate in the United States}}
[[File:Medicare and Medicaid GDP Chart.png|thumb|Medicare and Medicaid Spending as % GDP (data from the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]])]]
[[Health care compared#International comparisons|International comparisons of healthcare]] have found that the United States spends more per-capita than other similarly developed nations but falls below similar countries in various health metrics, suggesting inefficiency and waste. In addition, the United States has significant [[underinsurance (healthcare)|underinsurance]] and significant impending unfunded liabilities from its aging demographic and its [[social insurance]] programs [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] (Medicaid provides free long-term care to the elderly poor). The fiscal and human impact of these issues have motivated reform proposals.

According to 2009 World Bank statistics, the U.S. had the highest healthcare costs relative to the size of the economy (GDP) in the world, even though estimated 50.2 million citizens (approximately 15.6% of the September 2011 estimated population of 312 million) lacked insurance.&lt;ref name="WHO 2009"&gt;{{cite web |author=WHO |date=May 2009 |title=World Health Statistics 2009 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2009/en/index.html |accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, billionaire [[Warren Buffett]] commented that the high costs paid by U.S. companies for their employees' health care put them at a competitive disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Funk |first=Josh |title=Buffett says economy recovering but at slow rate |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=SFGate.com |date=March 1, 2010 |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-01/business/18371919_1_berkshire-hathaway-billionaire-warren-buffett-health-care |accessdate=April 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306012352/http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-01/business/18371919_1_berkshire-hathaway-billionaire-warren-buffett-health-care |archivedate=March 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, an estimated 77 million [[Baby Boomers]] are reaching retirement age, which combined with significant annual increases in healthcare costs per person will place enormous budgetary strain on U.S. state and federal governments, particularly through [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] spending (Medicaid provides long-term care for the elderly poor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/media/globalexecutive/coming_gen_storm_e_02.pdf |title=coming_gen_storm_e.indd |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining the long-term fiscal health of the U.S. federal government is significantly dependent on healthcare costs being controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10697 |title=Charlie Rose-Peter Orszag Interview Transcript |date=November 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111174416/http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10697 |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurance cost and availability===
{{further|Health insurance coverage in the United States}}
In addition, the number of employers who offer health insurance has declined and costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising: from 2001 to 2007, premiums for family coverage increased 78%, while wages rose 19% and prices rose 17%, according to the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2007"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Health Insurance Premiums Rise 6.1% In 2007, Less Rapidly Than In Recent Years But Still Faster Than Wages And Inflation |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=September 11, 2007 |url=http://www.kff.org/insurance/ehbs091107nr.cfm |accessdate=September 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329111855/http://www.kff.org/insurance/ehbs091107nr.cfm |archivedate=March 29, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even for those who are employed, the private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the [[Commonwealth Fund]] published in [[Health Affairs]] estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. The underinsured were significantly more likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care, report financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes&amp;nbsp;— 73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cathy Schoen |author2=Michelle M.

The cost of insurance has been a primary motivation in the reform of the US healthcare system, and many different explanations have been proposed in the reasons for high insurance costs and how to remedy them. One critique and motivation for healthcare reform has been the development of the [[medical–industrial complex]]. This relates to moral arguments for health care reform, framing healthcare as a social good, one that is fundamentally immoral to deny to people based on economic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt7zswmt.7|title=Health Care as a Social Good|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=9781626160774|editor-last=CRAIG|editor-first=DAVID M.|series=Religious Values and American Democracy|pages=85–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motivation behind healthcare reform in response to the medical-industrial complex also stems from issues of social inequity, promotion of medicine over preventative care.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt183p79j|title=To Live and Die in America: Class, Power, Health and Healthcare|last=Chernomas|first=Robert|last2=Hudson|first2=Ian|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Pluto Books|isbn=9780745332123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical-industrial complex, defined as a network of health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the like, plays a role in the complexity of the US insurance market and a fine line between government and industry within it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.7591/j.ctt1h4mjdm.6|title=Third Wave Capitalism|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9781501702310|editor-last=Ehrenreich|editor-first=John|series=How Money, Power, and the Pursuit of Self-Interest Have Imperiled the American Dream|pages=39–77|doi=10.7591/j.ctt1h4mjdm.6#page_scan_tab_contents}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, critiques of insurance markets being conducted under a capitalistic, free-market model also include that medical solutions, as opposed to preventative healthcare measures, are promoted to maintain this medical-industrial complex.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Arguments for a market-based approach to health insurance include the Grossman model, which is based on an ideal competitive model, but others have critiqued this, arguing that fundamentally, this means that people in higher socioeconomic levels will receive a better quality of healthcare.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Uninsured rate'''&lt;/big&gt;

Another concern is the rate of uninsured people in the US. In June 2014, [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]–Healthways Well–Being conducted a survey and found that the uninsured rate is going down. 13.4 percent of U.S. adults are uninsured in 2014. This is a decrease from the percentage at 17.1 percent in January 2014 and translates to roughly 10 million to 11 million individuals who gained coverage. The survey also looked at the major demographic groups and found each is making progress towards getting health insurance. However, Hispanics, who have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group, are lagging in their progress. Under the new health care reform, Latinos were expected to be major beneficiaries of the new health care law. Gallup found that the biggest drop in the uninsured rate (2.8 percentage points) was among households making less than $36,000 a year.&lt;ref name="ALONSO-ZALDIVAR :survey"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_HEALTH_OVERHAUL_UNINSURED?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2014-03-10-03-31-55 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310195507/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_HEALTH_OVERHAUL_UNINSURED?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2014-03-10-03-31-55 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 10, 2014 |title=SURVEY: UNINSURED RATE DROPS; HEALTH LAW CITED |last=ALONSO-ZALDIVAR |first=RICARDO |date=March 10, 2014 |newspaper=The Associated Press |accessdate=March 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Easly-ACA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politicususa.com/2014/03/10/republicans-darkest-fears-realized-obamacare-number-uninsured-drop-age-group.html|title=Republicans Darkest Fears Realized: ACA Causes Number of Uninsured to Drop Across All Ages|last=Easley|first=Jason|date=March 10, 2014|newspaper=Politicus USA|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howell-uninsured"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/10/rate-uninsured-americans-dropping-gallup/|title=Rate of uninsured Americans is dropping: Gallup|last=Howell|first=Tom|date=March 10, 2014|newspaper=Washington Times|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste and fraud===
In December 2011 the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, [[Donald Berwick]], asserted that 20% to 30% of health care spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1) overtreatment of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the administrative complexity of the [[health care system]], (4) burdensome rules and (5) fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Pear | first = Robert | title = Health Official Takes Parting Shot at 'Waste' | newspaper = New York Times | date = December 3, 2011 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/health/policy/parting-shot-at-waste-by-key-obama-health-official.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1| accessdate =December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 3%–10% of all health care expenditures in the U.S. are fraudulent. In 2011, Medicare and Medicaid made $65 billion in improper payments (including both error and fraud). Government efforts to reduce fraud include $4.2 billion in fraudulent payments recovered by the Department of Justice and the FBI in 2012, longer jail sentences specified by the Affordable Care Act, and [[Senior Medicare Patrols]]—volunteers trained to identify and report fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bankrate.com/financing/retirement/how-big-is-medicare-fraud/ | title=How big is Medicare fraud? | publisher=Bankrate | work=Retirement Blog | date=February 21, 2013 | accessdate=November 28, 2013 | author=Phipps, Jennie L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International comparisons==
The ''International Federation of Health Plans'' provides a comparative annual survey of costs for drugs, devices and medical services across countries. According to their 2013 report, the U.S. pays considerably more than other countries in 22 of 23 categories. For example, the average cost of a hip replacement in the U.S. was $40,364, with other countries ranging from $3,365 (Argentina) to $27,810 (Australia). An MRI averaged $1,121 in the U.S. versus $280 in France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/26/21-graphs-that-show-americas-health-care-prices-are-ludicrous/ Washington Post-Ezra Klein-21 graphs that show America’s health-care prices are ludicrous-March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for these differences are driven by higher prices per unit of service, rather than a higher volume of usage. In other countries, governments intervene more forcefully in setting prices. In countries such as Canada and Britain, prices are set by the government. In others, such as Germany and Japan, they’re set by providers and insurers sitting in a room and coming to an agreement, with the government stepping in to set prices if they fail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/15/why-an-mri-costs-1080-in-america-and-280-in-france/ Washington Post-Ezra Klein-Why an MRI costs $1,080 in America and $280 in France-March 15, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importation of prescription drugs===
{{Further|Prescription drug prices in the United States}}
Congressional proponents argue that drugs manufactured overseas by U.S. companies could be imported and purchased more cheaply in the U.S. Drug manufacturers argue that certain foreign countries have price controls, which they recoup by charging higher prices in the U.S. Whitehouse spokesman Robert Gibbs said President Obama is supportive of importing drugs, provided safety concerns related to the drugs can be addressed. This is because drugs manufactured outside the country may be held to different standards. According to Bloomberg News, drugmakers agreed in June 2009 to contribute $80 billion over 10 years, largely to help the elderly afford medicines, in return for staving off other profit-endangering proposals such as drug importation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jensen |first=Kristin |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601070&amp;sid=a9cHvESqSQ2U |title=Bloomberg-McCain Charges Democrats Pandering to Drugmakers on Import Ban-December 11, 2009 |publisher=Bloomberg |date=December 11, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acute hepatitis ===
Acute viral hepatitis follows three distinct phases:
# The initial [[Prodrome|prodromal phase]] (preceding symptoms) involves non-specific and flu-like symptoms common to many acute viral infections. These include [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], poor appetite, joint pain, and headaches.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CURRENT Diagnosis &amp; Treatment" /&gt; Fever, when present, is most common in cases of hepatitis A and E.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt; Late in this phase, people can experience liver-specific symptoms, including [[choluria]] (dark urine) and clay-colored stools.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CURRENT Diagnosis &amp; Treatment" /&gt;
# [[Jaundice|Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes]] follow the prodrome after about 1–2 weeks and can last for up to 4 weeks.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CURRENT Diagnosis &amp; Treatment" /&gt; The non-specific symptoms seen in the prodromal typically resolve by this time, but people will develop an [[hepatomegaly|enlarged liver]] and right upper abdominal pain or discomfort.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt; 10–20% of people will also experience an [[Splenomegaly|enlarged spleen]], while some people will also experience a mild unintentional weight loss.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khalili &amp; Burman" /&gt;
# The recovery phase is characterized by resolution of the clinical symptoms of hepatitis with persistent elevations in [[Liver function tests|liver lab values]] and potentially a persistently enlarged liver.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt; All cases of hepatitis A and E are expected to fully resolve after 1–2 months.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt; Most hepatitis B cases are also self-limiting and will resolve in 3–4 months.  Few cases of hepatitis C will resolve completely.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;
Both [[drug-induced hepatitis]] and [[autoimmune hepatitis]] can present very similarly to acute viral hepatitis, with slight variations in symptoms depending on the cause.&lt;ref name="Fontana &amp; Hayashi"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fontana|first=Robert|last2=Hayashi|first2=Paul|date=2014-05-01|title=Clinical Features, Diagnosis, and Natural History of Drug-Induced Liver Injury|url=http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-0034-1375955|journal=Seminars in Liver Disease|language=en|volume=34|issue=02|pages=134–144|doi=10.1055/s-0034-1375955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manns Lohse Vergani"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manns|first=Michael P.|last2=Lohse|first2=Ansgar W.|last3=Vergani|first3=Diego|title=Autoimmune hepatitis – Update 2015|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168827815001658|journal=Journal of Hepatology|volume=62|issue=1|pages=S100–S111|doi=10.1016/j.jhep.2015.03.005|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of drug-induced hepatitis can manifest with systemic signs of an allergic reaction including rash, fever, [[serositis]] (inflammation of membranes lining certain organs), elevated [[Eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophils]] (a type of white blood cell), and [[Bone marrow suppression|suppression of bone marrow activity]].&lt;ref name="Fontana &amp; Hayashi" /&gt;

=== Fulminant hepatitis ===
Fulminant hepatitis, or massive hepatic [[necrosis|cell death]], is a rare and life-threatening complication of acute hepatitis that can occur in cases of hepatitis B, D, and E, in addition to drug-induced and autoimmune hepatitis.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fontana &amp; Hayashi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manns Lohse Vergani" /&gt; The complication more frequently occurs in instances of hepatitis B and D co-infection at a rate of 2–20% and in pregnant women with hepatitis E at rate of 15–20% of cases.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CURRENT Diagnosis &amp; Treatment" /&gt; In addition to the signs of acute hepatitis, people can also demonstrate signs of [[coagulopathy]] (abnormal coagulation studies with easy bruising and bleeding) and [[encephalopathy]] (confusion, disorientation, and [[somnolence|sleepiness]]).&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CURRENT Diagnosis &amp; Treatment" /&gt; Mortality due to fulminant hepatitis is typically the result of various complications including [[cerebral edema]], [[gastrointestinal bleeding]], [[sepsis]], [[respiratory failure]], or [[kidney failure]].&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;

=== Chronic hepatitis ===
Acute cases of hepatitis are seen to be resolved well within a six-month period. When hepatitis is continued for more than six months it is termed chronic hepatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munjal|first1=Y.

== Causes ==
Causes of hepatitis can be divided into the following major categories: infectious, metabolic, ischemic, autoimmune, genetic, and other. Infectious agents include viruses, bacteria, and parasites. [[Hepatotoxicity|Toxins, drugs]], [[Alcoholic liver disease|alcohol]], and [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]] are metabolic causes of liver injury and inflammation. [[Autoimmune hepatitis|Autoimmune]] and genetic causes of hepatitis involve genetic predispositions and tend to affect characteristic populations.

[[Hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], and [[hepatitis D]] are transmitted when blood or [[mucous membrane]]s are exposed to infected blood and body fluids, such as semen and vaginal secretions.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt; Viral particles have also been found in saliva and breastmilk.  However, kissing, sharing utensils, and breastfeeding do not lead to transmission unless these fluids are introduced into open sores or cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HBV/PDFs/HepBWhenSomeoneClose.pdf|title=When Someone Close to You Has Hepatitis|last=Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention|date=June 2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=March 14, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306084204/http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HBV/PDFs/HepBWhenSomeoneClose.pdf|archivedate=March 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hepatitis B and C can present either acutely or chronically.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt; Hepatitis D is a defective virus that requires hepatitis B to replicate and is only found with hepatitis B co-infection.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt; In adults, hepatitis B infection is most commonly self-limiting, with less than 5% progressing to chronic state, and 20 to 30% of those chronically infected developing cirrhosis or liver cancer.&lt;ref name="WHO Hepatitis B" /&gt; However, infection in infants and children frequently leads to chronic infection.&lt;ref name="WHO Hepatitis B" /&gt;

Autoimmune hepatitis can present anywhere within the spectrum from asymptomatic to acute or chronic hepatitis to fulminant liver failure.&lt;ref name="Friedman 55e" /&gt; Patients are asymptomatic 25–34% of the time, and the diagnosis is suspected on the basis of abnormal liver function tests.&lt;ref name="Czaja Autoimmune" /&gt; Up to 40% of cases present with signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis.&lt;ref name="Friedman 55e" /&gt; As with other autoimmune diseases, autoimmune hepatitis usually affects young women (though it can affect patients of either sex of any age), and patients can exhibit classic signs and symptoms of autoimmunity such as fatigue, anemia, anorexia, [[Amenorrhoea|amenorrhea]], acne, arthritis, [[pleurisy]], [[thyroiditis]], [[ulcerative colitis]], [[nephritis]], and [[maculopapular rash]].&lt;ref name="Friedman 55e" /&gt; Autoimmune hepatitis increases the risk for cirrhosis, and the risk for liver cancer is increased by about 1% for each year of the disease.&lt;ref name="Friedman 55e" /&gt;

In the case of [[Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease|non-alcoholic steatohepatitis]], this cascade is initiated by changes in metabolism associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and lipid dysregulation.&lt;ref name="Hardy Oakley Anstee Day"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy|first=Timothy|last2=Oakley|first2=Fiona|last3=Anstee|first3=Quentin M.|last4=Day|first4=Christopher P.|date=2016-03-03|title=Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Pathogenesis and Disease Spectrum|journal=Annual Review of Pathology|doi=10.1146/annurev-pathol-012615-044224|issn=1553-4014|pmid=26980160|volume=11|pages=451–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoon &amp; Cha Pathogenesis"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoon|first=Hye-Jin|last2=Cha|first2=Bong Soo|date=2014-11-27|title=Pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease|journal=World Journal of Hepatology|volume=6|issue=11|pages=800–811|doi=10.4254/wjh.v6.i11.800|issn=1948-5182|pmc=4243154|pmid=25429318}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[alcoholic hepatitis]], chronic excess alcohol use is the culprit.&lt;ref name="Chayanupatkul &amp; Liangpunsakul" /&gt;  Though the inciting event may differ, the progression of events is similar and begins with accumulation of free [[fatty acid]]s (FFA) and their breakdown products  in the liver cells in a process called [[steatosis]].&lt;ref name="Hardy Oakley Anstee Day" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoon &amp; Cha Pathogenesis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chayanupatkul &amp; Liangpunsakul" /&gt; This initially reversible process overwhelms the [[hepatocyte]]'s ability to maintain lipid homeostasis leading to a toxic effect  as fat molecules accumulate and are broken down in the setting of an [[Cellular stress response|oxidative stress response]].&lt;ref name="Hardy Oakley Anstee Day" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoon &amp; Cha Pathogenesis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chayanupatkul &amp; Liangpunsakul" /&gt;  Over time, this abnormal lipid deposition triggers the [[immune system]] via [[Toll-like receptor|toll-like receptor 4]] (TLR4) resulting in the production of inflammatory [[cytokine]]s such as TNF that cause liver cell injury and death.&lt;ref name="Hardy Oakley Anstee Day" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoon &amp; Cha Pathogenesis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chayanupatkul &amp; Liangpunsakul" /&gt;  These events mark the transition to [[steatohepatitis]] and in the setting of chronic injury, [[fibrosis]] eventually develops setting up events that lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.&lt;ref name="Hardy Oakley Anstee Day" /&gt; Microscopically, changes that can be seen include steatosis with large and swollen hepatocytes ([[Ballooning degeneration|ballooning]]), evidence of cellular injury and cell death (apoptosis, necrosis), evidence of inflammation in particular in [[Liver|zone 3 of the liver]], variable degrees of fibrosis and [[Mallory body|Mallory bodies]].&lt;ref name="Hardy Oakley Anstee Day" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Definition, epidemiology, and magnitude"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basra|first=Sarpreet|last2=Anand|first2=Bhupinderjit S.|date=2011-05-27|title=Definition, epidemiology and magnitude of alcoholic hepatitis|journal=World Journal of Hepatology|volume=3|issue=5|pages=108–113|doi=10.4254/wjh.v3.i5.108|issn=1948-5182|pmc=3124876|pmid=21731902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haga|first=Yuki|last2=Kanda|first2=Tatsuo|last3=Sasaki|first3=Reina|last4=Nakamura|first4=Masato|last5=Nakamoto|first5=Shingo|last6=Yokosuka|first6=Osamu|date=2015-12-14|title=Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatic cirrhosis: Comparison with viral hepatitis-associated steatosis|journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology|volume=21|issue=46|pages=12989–12995|doi=10.3748/wjg.v21.i46.12989|issn=2219-2840|pmc=4674717|pmid=26675364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viral hepatitis ===
{{Main|Viral hepatitis}}

Viral hepatitis is primarily diagnosed through blood tests for levels of viral [[antigen]]s (such as the [[HBsAg|hepatitis B surface]] or [[HBcAg|core]] antigen), anti-viral antibodies (such as the anti-hepatitis B surface antibody or anti-hepatitis A antibody), or viral DNA/RNA.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman 55e" /&gt; In early infection (i.e. within 1 week), [[Immunoglobulin M|IgM]] antibodies are found in the blood.&lt;ref name="Friedman 55e" /&gt; In late infection and after recovery, [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] antibodies are present and remain in the body for up to years.&lt;ref name="Friedman 55e" /&gt; Therefore, when a patient is positive for IgG antibody but negative for IgM antibody, he is considered [[Immunity (medical)|immune]] from the virus via either prior infection and recovery or prior vaccination.&lt;ref name="Friedman 55e" /&gt;

In the case of hepatitis B, blood tests exist for multiple virus antigens (which are different components of the [[:File:HBV.png|virion particle]]) and antibodies.&lt;ref name="pmid26568915"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2015 |title=Update on hepatitis B and C virus diagnosis |journal=World Journal of Virology |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=323–42 |doi=10.5501/wjv.v4.i4.323 |pmc=4641225 |pmid=26568915 |vauthors=Villar LM, Cruz HM, Barbosa JR, Bezerra CS, Portilho MM, Scalioni Lde P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of antigen and antibody positivity can provide information about the stage of infection (acute or chronic), the degree of viral replication, and the infectivity of the virus.&lt;ref name="pmid26568915" /&gt;

=== Alcoholic versus non-alcoholic ===
The most apparent distinguishing factor between [[Alcoholic hepatitis|alcoholic steatohepatitis]] (ASH) and [[Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis|nonalcoholic steatohepatitis]] (NASH) is a history of alcohol use or abuse.&lt;ref name="Neuman, French, et al"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neuman|first=Manuela G.|last2=French|first2=Samuel W.|last3=French|first3=Barbara A.|last4=Seitz|first4=Helmut K.|last5=Cohen|first5=Lawrence B.|last6=Mueller|first6=Sebastian|last7=Osna|first7=Natalia A.|last8=Kharbanda|first8=Kusum K.|last9=Seth|first9=Devanshi|date=2014-12-01|title=Alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014480014001464|journal=Experimental and Molecular Pathology|volume=97|issue=3|pages=492–510|doi=10.1016/j.yexmp.2014.09.005|pmc=4696068|pmid=25217800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in patients who have no or negligible alcohol use, the diagnosis is unlikely to be alcoholic hepatitis. However, in those who use alcohol, the diagnosis may just as likely be alcoholic or nonalcoholic hepatitis especially if there is concurrent obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. In this case, alcoholic and nonalcoholic hepatitis can be distinguished by the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities; specifically, in alcoholic steatohepatitis AST&gt;ALT with ratio of AST:ALT&gt;2:1 while in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ALT&gt;AST with ratio of ALT:AST&gt;1.5:1.&lt;ref name="Neuman, French, et al" /&gt;

Of note, liver biopsy shows identical findings in patients with ASH and NASH, specifically, the presence of [[Granulocyte|polymorphonuclear]] infiltration, hepatocyte [[necrosis]] and [[apoptosis]] in the form of [[ballooning degeneration]], [[Mallory body|Mallory bodies]], and fibrosis around veins and sinuses.&lt;ref name="Friedman 55e" /&gt;

== Screening ==

=== Viral hepatitis ===
The purpose of screening for viral hepatitis is to identify people infected with the disease as early as possible.&lt;ref name="CDC recommendations for Hepatitis B"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5708a1.htm#fig3|title=Recommendations for Identification and Public Health Management of Persons with Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-03-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306035320/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5708a1.htm#fig3|archivedate=2016-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for early treatment, which can prevent disease progression, and decreases transmission to others.&lt;ref name="CDC recommendations for Hepatitis B" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Screening for Hepatitis B"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK208504/|title=Screening for Hepatitis B Virus Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Systematic Review to Update the 2004 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation|last=Chou|first=Roger|last2=Dana|first2=Tracy|last3=Bougatsos|first3=Christina|last4=Blazina|first4=Ian|last5=Zakher|first5=Bernadette|last6=Khangura|first6=Jessi|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US)|series=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Evidence Syntheses, formerly Systematic Evidence Reviews|location=Rockville (MD)|pmid=24921112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hepatitis A ====
Hepatitis A causes an acute illness that does not progress to chronic liver disease. Therefore, the role of screening is to assess immune status in people who are at high risk of contracting the virus, as well as in people with known liver disease for whom hepatitis A infection could lead to liver failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/surveillanceguidelines.htm|title=Guidelines For Viral Hepatitis Surveillance And Case Management|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-03-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310094046/http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/surveillanceguidelines.htm|archivedate=2016-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harrison's Manual of Medicine, 18e, Chapter 164: Chronic Hepatitis|last=Longo DL, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Jameson J, Loscalzo J. eds.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2013|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; People in these groups who are not already immune can receive the [[hepatitis A vaccine]].

The CDC recommends the [[hepatitis A vaccine]] for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.&lt;ref name="WHO Hep A Fact Sheet July 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hepatitis A Fact sheet N°328|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs328/en/|website=WHO Media Centre|accessdate=March 7, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221042107/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs328/en/|archivedate=February 21, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Voise 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voise|first1=Nathan|title=Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

For children 12 months of age or older, the vaccination is given as a shot into the muscle in two doses 6–18 months apart and should be started before the age 24 months.&lt;ref name="CDC Birth-18Y Immunizations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Birth-18 Years and Catchup Immunization Schedules for Providers.|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html|website=www.CDC.gov|accessdate=March 7, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306220930/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html|archivedate=March 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;The dosing is slightly different for adults depending on the type of the vaccine. &amp;nbsp;If the vaccine is for hepatitis A only, two doses are given 6–18 months apart depending on the manufacturer.&lt;ref name="CDC Adult Vaccine"/&gt; &amp;nbsp;If the vaccine is [[Hepatitis A vaccine|combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B]], up to 4 doses may be required.&lt;ref name="CDC Adult Vaccine"/&gt;

==== Hepatitis B ====
{{Main|Hepatitis B vaccine|l1=Hepatitis B vaccine}}

The CDC recommends the routine vaccination of all children under the age of 19 with the [[hepatitis B vaccine]].&lt;ref name="CDC Update 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Centers for Disease Control|title=Update: recommendations to prevent hepatitis B virus transmission—United States.

Routine vaccination for hepatitis B starts with the first dose administered as &amp;nbsp;a shot into the muscle before the newborn is discharged from the hospital.  An additional two doses should be administered before the child is 18 months.&lt;ref name="CDC Birth-18Y Immunizations"/&gt;

For babies born to a mother with hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, the first dose is unique – in addition to the vaccine, the hepatitis immune globulin should also be administered, both within 12 hours of birth. &amp;nbsp;These newborns should also be regularly tested for infection for at least the first year of life.&lt;ref name="CDC Birth-18Y Immunizations"/&gt;

There is also a combination formulation that includes [[Hepatitis A vaccine|both hepatitis A and B vaccines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/hepatitis-a-and-hepatitis-b-vaccine-intramuscular-route/description/drg-20061965|title=Hepatitis A And Hepatitis B Vaccine (Intramuscular Route)|last=|first=|date=|website=Mayo Clinic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other ====

There are currently no vaccines available in the United States for hepatitis C  or E.&lt;ref name="Final Recommendation Statement: Hepatitis C: Screening" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO - Hepatitis E" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO Hepatitis D" /&gt;

=== Behavioral changes ===

==== Hepatitis A ====
Because hepatitis A is transmitted primarily through the [[Fecal-oral route|oral-fecal route]], the mainstay of prevention aside from vaccination is good hygiene, access to clean water and proper handling of sewage.&lt;ref name="Voise 2011" /&gt;

==== Hepatitis B and C ====
As hepatitis B and C are transmitted through blood and multiple [[bodily fluids]], prevention is aimed at screening blood prior to [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]], abstaining from the use of injection drugs, safe needle and sharps practices in healthcare settings, and safe sex practices.&lt;ref name="WHO Hepatitis B" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Final Recommendation Statement: Hepatitis C: Screening" /&gt;

====Hepatitis D====

The hepatitis D virus requires that a person first be infected with hepatitis B virus, so prevention efforts should focus on limiting the spread of hepatitis B. In people who have chronic hepatitis B infection and are at risk for [[superinfection]] with the hepatitis D virus, the preventive strategies are the same as for hepatitis B.&lt;ref name="WHO Hepatitis D"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrncs20011/en/index5.html|title=WHO {{!}} Hepatitis D|website=www.who.int|access-date=2016-03-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308152650/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrncs20011/en/index5.html|archivedate=2016-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hepatitis E====

Hepatitis E is spread primarily through the oral-fecal route but may also be spread by blood and from mother to fetus.  The mainstay of hepatitis E prevention is similar to that for hepatitis A (namely, good hygiene and clean water practices).&lt;ref name="WHO - Hepatitis E"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/|title=Hepatitis E|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-03-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306175719/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/|archivedate=2016-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alcoholic hepatitis====

As excessive alcohol consumption can lead to hepatitis and cirrhosis, the following are maximal recommendations for alcohol consumption:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/moderate-binge-drinking|title=Drinking Levels Defined {{!}} National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)|website=www.niaaa.nih.gov|access-date=2016-03-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323085131/http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/moderate-binge-drinking|archivedate=2016-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Women – ≤ 3 drinks on any given day and ≤ 7 drinks per week
* Men – ≤ 4 drinks on any given day and ≤ 14 drinks per week

=== Successes ===

====Hepatitis A====

In the United States, universal immunization has led to a two-thirds decrease in hospital admissions and medical expenses due to hepatitis A.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franco|first=Elisabetta|last2=Meleleo|first2=Cristina|last3=Serino|first3=Laura|last4=Sorbara|first4=Debora|last5=Zaratti|first5=Laura|date=2012-03-27|title=Hepatitis A: Epidemiology and prevention in developing countries|journal=World Journal of Hepatology|volume=4|issue=3|pages=68–73|doi=10.4254/wjh.v4.i3.68|issn=1948-5182|pmc=3321492|pmid=22489258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hepatitis C====

Hepatitis C infections each year had been declining since the 1980s, but began to increase again in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2013surveillance/commentary.htm|title=Commentary {{!}} U.S. 2013 Surveillance Data for Viral Hepatitis {{!}} Statistics &amp; Surveillance &amp;nbsp;{{!}} Division of Viral Hepatitis {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-03-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305151134/http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2013surveillance/commentary.htm|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The data are unclear as to whether the decline can be attributed to [[needle exchange programme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wright NMJ, Millson CE, Tompkins CNE (2005).

====Alcoholic hepatitis====

Because people with alcoholic hepatitis may have no symptoms, it can be difficult to diagnose and the number of people with the disease is probably higher than many estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basra|first=Sarpreet|last2=Anand|first2=Bhupinderjit S|date=2011-05-27|title=Definition, epidemiology and magnitude of alcoholic hepatitis|journal=World Journal of Hepatology|volume=3|issue=5|pages=108–113|doi=10.4254/wjh.v3.i5.108|issn=1948-5182|pmc=3124876|pmid=21731902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs such as [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] have been successful in decreasing death due to [[cirrhosis]], but it is difficult to evaluate their success in decreasing the incidence of alcoholic hepatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh27-3/209-219.htm|title=The Epidemiology of Alcoholic Liver Disease|website=pubs.niaaa.nih.gov|access-date=2016-03-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180417/http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh27-3/209-219.htm|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
Treatment of hepatitis varies based on the form (acute versus chronic), severity of disease, and cause.&amp;nbsp;

=== Hepatitis A ===
{{main|Hepatitis A}}
Hepatitis A generally does not progress to a chronic state and rarely requires hospitalization.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO Hep A Fact Sheet July 2015" /&gt; Treatment is supportive and includes such measures as providing intravenous (IV) hydration and maintaining adequate nutrition.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO Hep A Fact Sheet July 2015" /&gt;

Rarely, people with the hepatitis A virus can rapidly develop liver failure, termed ''fulminant hepatic failure'', especially the elderly and those who had a pre-existing liver disease, especially hepatitis C.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO Hep A Fact Sheet July 2015" /&gt; Mortality risk factors include greater age and chronic hepatitis C.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt; In these cases, more aggressive supportive therapy and liver transplant may be necessary.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;

=== Hepatitis B ===
{{main|Hepatitis B}}

==== Acute ====
In healthy patients, 95–99% recover with no long-lasting effects, and antiviral treatment is not warranted.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt; Age and comorbid conditions can result in a more prolonged and severe illness. Certain patients warrant hospitalization, especially those who present with clinical signs of ascites, peripheral edema, and hepatic encephalopathy, and laboratory signs of [[hypoglycemia]], prolonged [[prothrombin time]], low serum [[Albumin human|albumin]], and very high serum [[bilirubin]].&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;

In these rare, more severe acute cases, patients have been successfully treated with antiviral therapy similar to that used in cases of chronic hepatitis B, with nucleoside analogues such as [[entecavir]] or [[Tenofovir disoproxil|tenofovir]]. As there is a dearth of clinical trial data and the drugs used to treat are prone to developing [[Drug resistance|resistance]], experts recommend reserving treatment for severe acute cases, not mild to moderate.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;

==== Chronic ====
Chronic hepatitis B management aims to control viral replication, which is correlated with progression of disease.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; There have been 7 drug treatments approved to date in the United States:&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt;
* Injectable [[interferon alpha]] was the first therapy approved for chronic hepatitis B.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; It has several side effects, most of which are reversible with removal of therapy, but it has been supplanted by newer treatments for this indication.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; These include long-acting interferon bound to [[polyethylene glycol]] (pegylated interferon) and the oral nucleoside analogues.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; 
* [[Pegylated interferon]] (PEG IFN) is dosed just once a week as a subcutaneous injection and is both more convenient and effective than standard interferon.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; Although it does not develop resistance as do many of the oral antivirals, it is poorly tolerated and requires close monitoring.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; PEG IFN is estimated to cost about $18,000 per year in the United States, compared to $2,500-8,700 for the oral medications; however, its treatment duration is 48 weeks as opposed to the oral antivirals, which require indefinite treatment for most patients (minimum 1 year).&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; PEG IFN is not effective in patients with high levels of viral activity and cannot be used in immunosuppressed patients or those with cirrhosis.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt;
* [[Lamivudine]] was the first approved oral nucleoside analogue.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; While effective and potent, lamivudine has been replaced by newer, more potent treatments in the Western world and is no longer recommended as first-line treatment.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; However, it is still used in areas where newer agents either have not been approved or are too costly.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; Generally, the course of treatment is a minimum of one year with a minimum of six additional months of "consolidation therapy."&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; Based on viral response, longer therapy may be required, and certain patients require indefinite long-term therapy.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; Due to a less robust response in Asian patients, [[consolidation therapy]] is recommended to be extended to at least a year.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; All patients should be monitored for viral reactivation, which if identified, requires restarting treatment.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; Lamivudine is generally safe and well-tolerated.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; Many patients develop resistance, which is correlated with longer treatment duration.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; If this occurs, an additional antiviral is added.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; Lamivudine as a single treatment is contraindicated in patients coinfected with HIV, as resistance develops rapidly, but it can be used as part of a multidrug regimen.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt;
* [[Adefovir dipivoxil]], a nucleotide analogue, has been used to supplement lamivudine in patients who develop resistance, but is no longer recommended as first-line therapy.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt;  
* [[Entecavir]] is safe, well tolerated, less prone to developing resistance, and the most potent of the existing hepatitis B antivirals; it is thus a first-line treatment choice.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; It is not recommended for lamivudine-resistant patients or as monotherapy in patients who are HIV positive.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt;
* [[Telbivudine]] is effective but not recommended as first-line treatment; as compared to entecavir, it is both less potent and more resistance prone.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt;
* [[Tenofovir disoproxil|Tenofovir]] is a nucleotide analogue and an antiretroviral drug that is also used to treat HIV infection.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; It is preferred to adefovir both in lamivudine-resistant patients and as initial treatment since it is both more potent and less likely to develop resistance.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt;
First-line treatments currently used include PEG IFN, entecavir, and tenofovir, subject to patient and physician preference.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; Treatment initiation is guided by recommendations issued by The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and is based on detectable viral levels, [[HBeAg]] positive or negative status, [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] levels, and in certain cases, family history of HCC and liver biopsy.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt; In patients with compensated cirrhosis, treatment is recommended regardless of HBeAg status or ALT level, but recommendations differ regarding HBV DNA levels; AASLD recommends treating at DNA levels detectable above 2x10&lt;sup href="jaundice"&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; IU/mL; EASL and WHO recommend treating when HBV DNA levels are detectable at any level.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO guidelines for chronic Hepatitis B" /&gt; In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, treatment and evaluation for liver transplantation are recommended in all cases if HBV DNA is detectable.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO guidelines for chronic Hepatitis B" /&gt; Currently, multidrug treatment is not recommended in treatment of chronic HBV as it is no more effective in the long term than individual treatment with entecavir or tenofovir.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt;

=== Hepatitis C ===
{{main|Hepatitis C}}
In contrast to hepatitis A and B, progression to chronic hepatitis C is much more common.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt; The ultimate goal of hepatitis C treatment is prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&lt;ref name="Messori Badiani Tripoli"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Messori|first=Andrea|last2=Badiani|first2=Brigitta|last3=Trippoli|first3=Sabrina|date=2015-12-01|title=Achieving Sustained Virological Response in Hepatitis C Reduces the Long-Term Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: An Updated Meta-Analysis Employing Relative and Absolute Outcome Measures|journal=Clinical Drug Investigation|volume=35|issue=12|pages=843–850|doi=10.1007/s40261-015-0338-y|issn=1179-1918|pmid=26446006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best way to reduce the long-term risk of HCC is to achieve sustained virological response (SVR).&lt;ref name="Messori Badiani Tripoli" /&gt; SVR is defined as an undetectable viral load at 12 weeks after treatment completion and indicates a cure.&lt;ref name="Revolution"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thiagarajan|first=Prarthana|last2=Ryder|first2=Stephen D.|date=2015-12-01|title=The hepatitis C revolution part 1: antiviral treatment options|journal=Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases|volume=28|issue=6|pages=563–571|doi=10.1097/QCO.0000000000000205|issn=1473-6527|pmid=26524328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enhancing our understanding"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gogela|first=Neliswa A.|last2=Lin|first2=Ming V.|last3=Wisocky|first3=Jessica L.|last4=Chung|first4=Raymond T.|date=2015-03-01|title=Enhancing our understanding of current therapies for Hepatitis C virus (HCV)|journal=Current HIV/AIDS Reports|volume=12|issue=1|pages=68–78|doi=10.1007/s11904-014-0243-7|issn=1548-3568|pmc=4373591|pmid=25761432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently available treatments include indirect and direct acting antiviral drugs.&lt;ref name="Revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enhancing our understanding"/&gt; The indirect acting antivirals include pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), which in combination have historically been the basis of therapy for HCV.&lt;ref name="Revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enhancing our understanding"/&gt; Duration of and response to these treatments varies based on genotype.&lt;ref name="Revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enhancing our understanding"/&gt; These agents are poorly tolerated but are still used in some resource-poor areas.&lt;ref name="Revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enhancing our understanding"/&gt; In high-resource countries, they have been supplanted by direct acting antiviral agents, which first appeared in 2011; these agents target proteins responsible for viral replication and include the following three classes:&lt;ref name="Revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enhancing our understanding"/&gt;
* NS3/4A protease inhibitors, including telaprevir, boceprevir, simeprevir, and others
* NS5A inhibitors, including ledipasvir, daclatasvir, and others
* NS5B polymerase inhibitors, including sofosbuvir, dasabuvir, and others
These drugs are used in various combinations, sometimes combined with ribavirin, based on the patient's genotype (delineated as genotypes 1-6).&lt;ref name="Enhancing our understanding"/&gt; Genotype 1 (GT1), which is the most prevalent genotype in the United States and around the world, can now be cured with a direct acting antiviral regimen.&lt;ref name="Enhancing our understanding"/&gt; First-line therapy for GT1 is a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) for 12 weeks for most patients, including those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.&lt;ref name="Enhancing our understanding"/&gt; Certain patients with early disease need only 8 weeks of treatment while those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who have not responded to prior treatment require 24 weeks.&lt;ref name="Enhancing our understanding"/&gt; Cost remains a major factor limiting access to these drugs, particularly in low-resource nations; the cost of the 12-week GT1 regimen (SOF/LDV)  has been estimated at US$94,500.&lt;ref name="Revolution"/&gt;

The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (AASLD-IDSA) recommend antiviral treatment for all patients with chronic hepatitis C infection except for those with additional chronic medical conditions that limit their life expectancy.&lt;ref name="AASLD-IDSA"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=AASLD/IDSA HCV Guidance Panel|date=2015-09-01|title=Hepatitis C guidance: AASLD-IDSA recommendations for testing, managing, and treating adults infected with hepatitis C virus|journal=Hepatology|volume=62|issue=3|pages=932–954|doi=10.1002/hep.27950|issn=1527-3350|pmid=26111063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hepatitis D ===
{{main|Hepatitis D}}
Hepatitis D is difficult to treat, and effective treatments are lacking.

First-line treatment of alcoholic hepatitis is treatment of alcoholism.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles chapter 363 (Alcohol)" /&gt; For those who abstain completely from alcohol, reversal of liver disease and a longer life are possible; patients at every disease stage have been shown to benefit by prevention of additional liver injury.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles chapter 363 (Alcohol)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chayanupatkul &amp; Liangpunsakul" /&gt; In addition to referral to psychotherapy and other treatment programs, treatment should include nutritional and psychosocial evaluation and treatment.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles chapter 363 (Alcohol)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chayanupatkul &amp; Liangpunsakul" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Comparative effectiveness - meta-analysis"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Siddharth|last2=Murad|first2=Mohammad Hassan|last3=Chandar|first3=Apoorva K.|last4=Bongiorno|first4=Connie M.|last5=Singal|first5=Ashwani K.|last6=Atkinson|first6=Stephen R.|last7=Thursz|first7=Mark R.|last8=Loomba|first8=Rohit|last9=Shah|first9=Vijay H.|date=2015-10-01|title=Comparative Effectiveness of Pharmacological Interventions for Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis|journal=Gastroenterology|volume=149|issue=4|pages=958–970.e12|doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2015.06.006|issn=1528-0012|pmid=26091937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients should also be treated appropriately for related signs and symptoms, such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and infection.&lt;ref name="Chayanupatkul &amp; Liangpunsakul" /&gt;

Weak evidence suggests [[Milk Thistle|milk thistle]] extracts may improve survival in alcoholic liver disease and improve certain liver tests (serum bilirubin and [[Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase|GGT]]) without causing side effects, but a firm recommendation cannot be made for or against milk thistle without further study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003620.pub3/abstract|title=Milk thistle for alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases|last=Rambaldi|first=Andrea|last2=Jacobs|first2=Bradly P|last3=Gluud|first3=Christian|date=2007-10-17|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|issn=1465-1858|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd003620.pub3|journal=Protocols|pmid=17943794|pages=CD003620|issue=4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326124759/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003620.pub3/abstract|archivedate=2016-03-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

=== Recommendations ===
Many people with hepatitis will prefer bed rest, though it is not necessary to avoid all physical activity while recovering.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt; A high-calorie diet is recommended.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt; Many people develop nausea and cannot tolerate food later in the day, so the bulk of intake may be concentrated in the earlier part of the day.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt; In the acute phase of the disease, intravenous feeding may be needed if patients cannot tolerate food and have poor oral intake subsequent to nausea and vomiting.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;

People with hepatitis should avoid taking drugs metabolized by the liver.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt; [[Glucocorticoid]]s are not recommended as a treatment option for acute viral hepatitis and may even cause harm, such as development of chronic hepatitis.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;

[[Universal precautions]] should be observed, but isolation is not strictly necessary; isolation may be needed in cases of fecal incontinence in hepatitis A and E and uncontrolled bleeding in hepatitis B and C.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;

== Prognosis ==

=== Acute hepatitis ===
Nearly all patients with hepatitis A infections recover completely without complications if they were healthy prior to the infection.  Similarly, acute hepatitis B infections have a favorable course towards complete recovery in 95–99% of patients.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;  However, certain factors may portend a poorer outcome, such as co-morbid medical conditions or initial presenting symptoms of ascites, edema, or encephalopathy.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;  Overall, the mortality rate for acute hepatitis is low: ~0.1% in total for cases of hepatitis A and B, but rates can be higher in certain populations (super infection with both hepatitis B and D, pregnant women, etc.).&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;

In contrast to hepatitis A &amp; B, hepatitis C carries a much higher risk of progressing to chronic hepatitis, approaching 85–90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hepatitis C Virus: From Molecular Virology to Antiviral Therapy|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Bartenschlager|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cirrhosis has been reported to develop in 20–50% of patients with chronic hepatitis C.

Other rare complications of acute hepatitis include [[pancreatitis]], [[aplastic anemia]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], and [[myocarditis]].&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;

==== Fulminant hepatitis ====
Despite the relatively benign course of most viral cases of hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis represents a rare but feared complication.  Fulminant hepatitis most commonly occurs in hepatitis B, D, and E.  About 1–2% of cases of hepatitis E can lead to fulminant hepatitis, but pregnant women are particularly susceptible, occurring in up to 20% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khuroo|first=MS|date=1981|title=Incidence and severity of viral hepatitis in pregnancy|url=|journal=Am J Med|doi=10.1016/0002-9343(81)90796-8 |pmid=|volume=70|page=A32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mortality rates in cases of fulminant hepatitis rise over 80%, but those patients that do survive often make a complete recovery.  Liver transplantation can be life-saving in patients with fulminant liver failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gill|first=RQ|date=2001|title=Acute Liver Failure|url=|journal=J Clin Gastroenterology|doi=10.1097/00004836-200109000-00005|pmid=11500606|volume=33|pages=191–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hepatitis D infections can transform benign cases of hepatitis B into severe, progressive hepatitis, a phenomenon known as [[superinfection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smedile|first=A|date=1981|title=Infection with the delta agent in chronic HBsAg carriers|url=|journal=Gastroenterology|doi= 10.1016/S0016-5085(81)80003-0|pmid=7286594|volume=81|pages=992–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chronic hepatitis ===
Acute hepatitis B infections become less likely to progress to chronic forms as the age of the patient increases, with rates of progression approaching 90% in vertically transmitted cases of infants compared to 1% risk in young adults.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt;  Overall, the 5-year survival rate for chronic hepatitis B ranges from 97% in mild cases to 55% in severe cases with cirrhosis.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 362 (Chronic)" /&gt;

Most patients who acquire hepatitis D at the same time as hepatitis B (co-infection) recover without developing a chronic infection; however, in people with hepatitis B who later acquire hepatitis D (superinfection), chronic infection is much more common at 80-90%, and liver disease progression is accelerated.&lt;ref name="Interferon alpha" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011727/abstract |title=Interferon alpha versus any other drug for chronic hepatitis D |last1=Abbas |first1=Zaigham |last2=Ali |first2=Syed Salman |last3=Shazi |first3=Lubna |date=2015-06-02 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |issn=1465-1858 |language=en |doi=10.1002/14651858.cd011727 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113013041/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011727/abstract |archivedate=2016-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronic hepatitis C progresses towards cirrhosis, with estimates of cirrhosis prevalence of 16% at 20 years after infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thein|first=Hla-Hla|last2=Yi|first2=Qilong|last3=Dore|first3=Gregory J.|last4=Krahn|first4=Murray D.|date=2008-08-01|title=Estimation of stage-specific fibrosis progression rates in chronic hepatitis C virus infection: a meta-analysis and meta-regression|journal=Hepatology|volume=48|issue=2|pages=418–431|doi=10.1002/hep.22375|issn=1527-3350|pmid=18563841}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the major causes of mortality in hepatitis C is end stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma is an important additional long term complication and cause of death in chronic hepatitis.

Rates of mortality increase with progression of the underlying liver disease.  Series of patients with compensated cirrhosis due to HCV have shown 3,5, and 10-year survival rates of 96, 91, and 79% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fattovich|first=G|date=1997|title=Morbidity and mortality in compensated cirrhosis type C: a retrospective follow-up study of 384 patients|url=|journal=Gastroenterology|doi=10.1053/gast.1997.v112.pm9024300|pmid=9024300|volume=112|pages=463–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 5-year survival rate drops to 50% upon if the cirrhosis becomes decompensated.

== History ==
{{see also | Timeline of hepatitis}}

=== Early thoughts ===
Initial accounts of a syndrome that we now think is likely to be hepatitis begin to occur around 3000 B.C.  Clay tablets that served as medical handbooks for the ancient Sumerians described the first observations of jaundice.  The Sumerians believed that the liver was the home of the soul, and attributed the findings of jaundice to the attack of one’s liver by a devil named Ahhazu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trepo |first1=Christian |date=February 2014 |title=A brief history of hepatitis milestones |journal=Liver International |volume=34 |issue=Supplement s1 |pages=29–37 |doi=10.1111/liv.12409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 400 B.C., [[Hippocrates]] recorded the first documentation of an epidemic jaundice, in particular noting the uniquely fulminant course of a cohort of patients who all died within two weeks.  He wrote, “The bile contained in the liver is full of phlegm and blood, and erupts...After such an eruption, the patient soon raves, becomes angry, talks nonsense and barks like a dog.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=July 2012 |title=Viral hepatitis—the silent killer. |journal=Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=279–80 |pmid=22892603 |last1=Oon |first1=GC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His recommended treatment was a mixture of honey and water called ''melikraton''.

Given the poor sanitary conditions of war, infectious jaundice played a large role as a major cause of mortality among troops in the Napoleonic Wars, the American Revolutionary War, and both World Wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Classic papers in viral hepatitis |editor1-last=Lee |editor1-first=Christine A. |editor2-last=Thomas |editor2-first=Howard  C. |date=1988 |publisher=Science Press |isbn=1-870026-10-1 |location=London, England |others=Foreword by Dame Sheila Sherlock}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, estimates of soldiers affected by hepatitis were upwards of 10 million.  Soldiers received vaccines against diseases such as yellow fever, but these vaccines were stabilized with human serum and often created epidemics of hepatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 1993 |title=The discovery of the hepatitis viruses. |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=955–63 |pmid=8385046 |last1=Purcell |first1=RH |doi=10.1016/0016-5085(93)90261-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from England, Findlay and MacCallum, suspected these epidemics to be due to a separate infectious agent and not due to the yellow fever virus itself after noting 89 cases of jaundice in the months after vaccination out of a total 3,100 patients that they vaccinated.  After changing the seed virus strain, they observed no cases of jaundice in the subsequent 8,000 vaccinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1946 |title=Homologous Serum Jaundice |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=649–654 |last1=Bradley |first1=WH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Willowbrook State School experiments ===
A New York University researcher named [[Saul Krugman]] continued this research into the 1950s and 1960s, most infamously with his experiments on mentally disabled children at the Willowbrook State School in New York, a crowded urban facility where hepatitis infections were highly endemic to the student body.  Krugman injected students with gamma globulin, a type of antibody.  After observing the temporary protection against infection this antibody provided, he then tried injected live hepatitis virus into students.  Krugman also controversially took feces from infected students, blended it into milkshakes, and fed it to newly admitted children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Intervention and Reflection: Basic Issues in Medical Ethics|last=Munson|first=Ronald|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=273–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His research was received with much controversy, as people protested the questionable ethics surrounding the chosen target population.  [[Henry K. Beecher|Henry Beecher]] was one of the foremost critics in an article in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' in 1966, arguing that parents were unaware to the risks of consent and that the research was done to benefit others at the expense of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beecher|first=Henry|date=1966|title=Ethics and Clinical Research|url=|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=274|pages=1354–1360|doi=10.1056/nejm196606162742405|pmid=5327352}}; Reprinted in {{cite journal |pmc=2566401 | pmid=11368058 | volume=79 | title=Ethics and clinical research. 1966 | year=2001 | author=Beecher HK | journal=Bull World Health Organ | pages=367–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, he argued that poor families with mentally disabled children often felt pressured to join the research project to gain admission to the school, with all of the educational and support resources that would come along with it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 1993|title=The discovery of the hepatitis viruses.|journal=Gastroenterology|volume=104|issue=4|pages=955–63|pmid=8385046|last1=Purcell|first1=RH|doi=10.1016/0016-5085(93)90261-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others in the medical community spoke out in support of Krugman's research in terms of its widespread benefits and understanding of the hepatitis virus, and Willowbrook continues to be a commonly cited example in debates about medical ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Textbook of Clinical Research Ethics|last=Emanuel|first=Ezekiel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=80–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Australia antigen ===
The next leap forward in research was a serendipitous one by [[Baruch Samuel Blumberg|Dr. Baruch Blumberg]], a researcher at the NIH who did not set out to research hepatitis, but rather studied lipoprotein genetics.  He travelled across the globe collecting blood samples, investigating the interplay between disease, environment, and genetics with the goal of designing  targeted interventions for at-risk individuals that could prevent them from getting sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Les Prix Nobel|last=Odelberg|first=Wilhelm|publisher=|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He noticed an unexpected interaction between the blood of a patient with [[Haemophilia|hemophilia]] that had received multiple transfusions and a protein found in the blood of an Australian aborigine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alter|first=Harvey J.|date=2014-01-01|title=The road not taken or how I learned to love the liver: A personal perspective on hepatitis history|journal=Hepatology|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=4–12|doi=10.1002/hep.26787|pmid=24123147|issn=1527-3350|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He named the protein the "Australia antigen" and made it the focus of his research.  He found a higher prevalence of the protein in the blood of patients from developing countries, compared to those from developed ones, and noted associations of the antigen with other diseases like leukemia and Down Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blumberg BS|last2=Alter HJ|date=1965-02-15|title=A "new" antigen in leukemia sera|journal=JAMA|volume=191|issue=7|pages=541–546|doi=10.1001/jama.1965.03080070025007|issn=0098-7484|pmid=14239025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, he came to the unifying conclusion that the Australia antigen was associated with viral hepatitis.  In 1970, [[David Dane]] first isolated the hepatitis B [[virion]] at London's Middlesex Hospital, and named the virion the 42-nm "Dane particle".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Based on its association with the surface of the hepatitis B virus, the Australia antigen was renamed to "hepatitis B surface antigen" or [[HBsAg]].  Blumberg continued to study the antigen, and eventually developed the first hepatitis B vaccine using plasma rich in HBsAg, for which he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] in 1976.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== Pregnancy ===

==== Hepatitis B ====
[[Vertically transmitted infection|Vertical transmission]] is a significant contributor of new [[hepatitis B virus|HBV]] cases each year, with 35–50% of transmission from mother to neonate in endemic countries.&lt;ref name="ACOG Practice Bulletin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mother-to-neonate"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Hepatic, Biliary, and Pancreatic Disorders." Williams Obstetrics, Twenty-Fourth Edition|last=Cunningham|first=F. Gary|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2013|location=New York, NY|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical transmission occurs largely via a neonate's exposure to maternal blood and vaginal secretions during birth.&lt;ref name="mother-to-neonate" /&gt; While the risk of progression to chronic infection is approximately 5% among adults who contract the virus, it is as high as 95% among neonates subject to vertical transmission.&lt;ref name="ACOG Practice Bulletin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tassopoulos|first=NC|display-authors=etal|date=June 1987|title=Natural history of acute hepatitis B surface antigen-positive hepatitis in Greek adults.|url=|journal=Gastroenterology|volume=92|pages=1844–50|doi=10.1016/0016-5085(87)90614-7|pmid=3569758}}&lt;!--|access-date=March 16, 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of viral transmission is approximately 10–20% when maternal blood is positive for HBsAg, and up to 90% when also positive for [[HBeAg]].&lt;ref name="ACOG Practice Bulletin" /&gt;

Given the high risk of perinatal transmission, the [[Centre for Disease Control|CDC]] recommends screening all pregnant women for HBV at their first prenatal visit.&lt;ref name="ACOG Practice Bulletin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5416a1.htm?s_cid=rr5416a1_e|title=A Comprehensive Immunization Strategy to Eliminate Transmission of Hepatitis B Virus Infection in the United States Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization  Practices (ACIP) Part 1: Immunization of Infants, Children, and Adolescents|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-03-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324191034/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5416a1.htm?s_cid=rr5416a1_e|archivedate=2016-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is safe for non-immune pregnant women to receive the HBV vaccine.&lt;ref name="ACOG Practice Bulletin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mother-to-neonate" /&gt; Based on the limited available evidence, the [[American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases]] (AASLD) recommends antiviral therapy in pregnant women whose viral load exceeds 200,000 IU/mL.&lt;ref name="AASLD guidelines for chronic B"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terrault|first=Norah A.|last2=Bzowej|first2=Natalie H.|last3=Chang|first3=Kyong-Mi|last4=Hwang|first4=Jessica P.|last5=Jonas|first5=Maureen M.|last6=Murad|first6=M.

The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]] states that the evidence available does not suggest any particular mode of delivery (i.e. [[Vaginal delivery|vaginal]] vs. [[Caesarean section|cesarean]]) is better at reducing vertical transmission in mothers with HBV.&lt;ref name="ACOG Practice Bulletin" /&gt;

The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and CDC recommend that neonates born to mothers with HBV should receive hepatitis B immune globulin ([[Hepatitis B immune globulin|HBIG]]) as well as the [[Hepatitis B vaccine|HBV vaccine]] within 12 hours of birth.&lt;ref name="CDC recommendations for Hepatitis B" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO guidelines for chronic Hepatitis B" /&gt; For infants who have received HBIG and the HBV vaccine, breastfeeding is safe.&lt;ref name="ACOG Practice Bulletin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mother-to-neonate" /&gt;

==== Hepatitis C ====
Estimates of the rate of [[hepatitis C virus|HCV]] vertical transmission range from 2–8%; a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found the risk to be 5.8% in HCV-positive, HIV-negative women.&lt;ref name="ACOG Practice Bulletin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benova - vertical transmission"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benova |first=Lenka |last2=Mohamoud |first2=Yousra A. |last3=Calvert |first3=Clara |last4=Abu-Raddad |first4=Laith J. |date=2014-09-15 |title=Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=765–773 |doi=10.1093/cid/ciu447 |issn=1537-6591 |pmc=4144266 |pmid=24928290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study found the risk of vertical transmission to be 10.8% in HCV-positive, HIV-positive women.&lt;ref name="Benova - vertical transmission" /&gt; Other studies have found the risk of vertical transmission to be as high as 44% among HIV-positive women.&lt;ref name="ACOG Practice Bulletin" /&gt; The risk of vertical transmission is higher when the virus is detectable in the mother's blood.&lt;ref name="Benova - vertical transmission" /&gt;

Evidence does not indicate that mode of delivery (i.e. vaginal vs. cesarean) has an effect on vertical transmission.&lt;ref name="ACOG Practice Bulletin" /&gt;

For women who are HCV-positive and HIV-negative, breastfeeding is safe; however, CDC guidelines suggest avoiding breastfeeding if a woman's nipples are "cracked or bleeding" to reduce the risk of transmission.&lt;ref name="ACOG Practice Bulletin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC - HCV prevention"&gt;{{cite journal |date=October 16, 1998 |title=Recommendations for Prevention and Control of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection and HCV-Related Chronic Disease |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00055154.htm |journal=MMWR |doi= |pmid=9790221 |access-date=March 16, 2016 |volume=47 |pages=1–39 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324082023/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00055154.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hepatitis E ====
Pregnant women who contract [[Hepatitis E virus|HEV]] are at significant risk of developing fulminant hepatitis with maternal mortality rates as high as 20–30%, most commonly in the third trimester .&lt;ref name="Harrison's Principles, chapter 360 (Acute Viral)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ACOG Practice Bulletin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mother-to-neonate" /&gt; A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of 47 studies that included 3968 people found maternal [[Case fatality rate|case-fatality rates]] (CFR) of 20.8% and fetal CFR of 34.2%; among women who developed fulminant hepatic failure, CFR was 61.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=H.|last2=Zhao|first2=Y.|last3=Zhang|first3=X.|last4=Wang|first4=B.|last5=Liu|first5=P.|date=2016-03-01|title=Case-fatality risk of pregnant women with acute viral hepatitis type E: a systematic review and meta-analysis|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0950268816000418|journal=Epidemiology &amp; Infection|volume=FirstView|pages=1–9|doi=10.1017/S0950268816000418|issn=1469-4409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hyperacusis'' is often coincident with [[tinnitus]]. Both conditions have a prevalence of about 10–15% and [[hearing loss]] as a major risk factor. However, there also appear to be important differences between the mechanisms involved in tinnitus and hyperacusis.&lt;ref name="pmid24012803"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knipper M, Van Dijk P, Nunes I, Rüttiger L, Zimmermann U | title = Advances in the neurobiology of hearing disorders: recent developments regarding the basis of tinnitus and hyperacusis | journal = Progress in Neurobiology | volume = 111 | issue =  | pages = 17–33 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24012803 | doi = 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2013.08.002 | url = https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0301008213000804/1-s2.0-S0301008213000804-main.pdf?_tid=ebe8c20a-acdc-11e7-b605-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1507545232_c5f3bb0b5290a9f0529da948f5eae845 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
In hyperacusis, the symptoms are ear pain, [[annoyance]], and general intolerance to many sounds that most people are unaffected by.  [[Crying|Crying spells]] or [[panic attack]]s may result from the experience of hyperacusis. It may affect either or both ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyperacusis: An Increased Sensitivity to Everyday Sounds|url=http://www.entnet.org/content/hyperacusis-increased-sensitivity-everyday-sounds|website=American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|language=en|date=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hyperacusis can also be accompanied by [[tinnitus]]. Hyperacusis can result in [[anxiety]], [[stress (biological)|stress]] and [[phonophobia]].  Avoidant behaviour is often a response to prevent the effects of hyperacusis and this can include avoiding social situations.

==Causes==
The most common cause of hyperacusis is overexposure to excessively high [[Decibel#Acoustics|decibel]] ([[sound pressure]]) levels.&lt;ref name="pmid25104073"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tyler RS, Pienkowski M, Roncancio ER, Jun HJ, Brozoski T, Dauman N, Dauman N, Andersson G, Keiner AJ, Cacace AT, Martin N, Moore BC | title = A review of hyperacusis and future directions: part I. Definitions and manifestations | journal = American Journal of Audiology | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 402–19 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25104073 | doi = 10.1044/2014_AJA-14-0010 | url = http://www.hyperacusis.net/media/1375/hyperacusis-part-1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some come down with hyperacusis suddenly as a result of taking ear sensitizing drugs, [[Lyme disease]], [[Ménière's disease]], head injury, or surgery. Others are born with sound sensitivity, develop [[superior canal dehiscence syndrome]], have had a history of ear infections, or come from a family that has had hearing problems.

Some [[psychoactive drugs]] such as [[LSD]], [[methaqualone]], or [[phencyclidine]] (''angel-dust'') can cause hyperacusis.&lt;ref name="Barceloux 2012 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Barceloux | first=Donald | name-list-format = vanc | title=Medical Toxicology of Drug Abuse : Synthesized Chemicals and Psychoactive Plants | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | publication-place=Hoboken, N.J | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-118-10605-1 | pages=457, 507, and 616}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[antibiotic]], [[ciprofloxacin]] has also been seen to be a cause, known as ''ciprofloxacin-related hyperacusis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.druginformer.com/search/side_effect_details/Ciprofloxacin/hyperacusis.html |title=Ciprofloxacin Related Hyperacusis, From FDA reports |date= 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurophysiological mechanisms ==
As one important mechanism, adaptation processes in the auditory brain that influence the dynamic range of neural responses are assumed to be distorted by irregular input from the inner ear. This is mainly caused by hearing loss related damages in the inner ear.&lt;ref name="pmid26139435"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brotherton H, Plack CJ, Maslin M, Schaette R, Munro KJ | title = Pump up the volume: could excessive neural gain explain tinnitus and hyperacusis? | journal = Audiology &amp; Neuro-Otology | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 273–82 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26139435 | doi = 10.1159/000430459 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic diagnostic test is similar to a normal [[audiogram]]. The difference is that additionally to the hearing threshold at each test frequency also the lowest uncomfortable sound level is measured. This level is called ''loudness discomfort level'' (LDL) or ''uncomfortable loudness level'' (ULL). In patients with hyperacusis this level is considerably lower than in normal subjects, and usually across most parts of the auditory spectrum.&lt;ref name="pmid25104073"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tyler RS, Pienkowski M, Roncancio ER, Jun HJ, Brozoski T, Dauman N, Dauman N, Andersson G, Keiner AJ, Cacace AT, Martin N, Moore BC | title = A review of hyperacusis and future directions: part I.

==Treatment==
One possible treatment for hyperacusis is retraining therapy which uses broadband noise. [[Tinnitus retraining therapy]], a treatment originally used to treat tinnitus, uses broadband noise to treat hyperacusis.  [[Pink noise]] can also be used to treat hyperacusis.  By listening to broadband noise at soft levels for a disciplined period of time each day, patients can rebuild (i.e., re-establish) their tolerances to sound. Although patients might not always make a complete recovery, the use of broadband noise usually gives some of them a significant improvement in their symptoms, especially if this is combined with counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindsey|first=Heather|date=August 2014|title=Help for Hyperacusis: Treatments Turn Down Discomfort|url=https://journals.lww.com/thehearingjournal/Fulltext/2014/08000/Help_for_Hyperacusis___Treatments_Turn_Down.1.aspx|journal=The Hearing Journal|language=en-US|volume=67|issue=8|pages=22|doi=10.1097/01.HJ.0000453391.20357.f7|issn=0745-7472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Formby C, Hawley ML, Sherlock LP, Gold S, Payne J, Brooks R, Parton JM, Juneau R, Desporte EJ, Siegle GR | title = A Sound Therapy-Based Intervention to Expand the Auditory Dynamic Range for Loudness among Persons with Sensorineural Hearing Losses: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial | journal = Seminars in Hearing | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 77–110 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 27516711 | pmc = 4906300 | doi = 10.1055/s-0035-1546958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25478787"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pienkowski M, Tyler RS, Roncancio ER, Jun HJ, Brozoski T, Dauman N, Coelho CB, Andersson G, Keiner AJ, Cacace AT, Martin N, Moore BC | title = A review of hyperacusis and future directions: part II.

'''Legal death''' is the recognition under the law of a particular jurisdiction that a person is no longer alive. In most cases, a doctor's declaration of death (variously called) or the identification of a [[corpse]] is a legal requirement for such recognition. A person who has been [[Missing person|missing]] for a sufficiently long period of time (typically at least several years) may be presumed or [[Declared death in absentia|declared legally dead]], usually by a court. When a death has been registered in a [[civil registry]], a [[death certificate]] may be issued. Such death certificate may be required in a number of legal situations, such as applying for [[probate]], claiming some benefits or making an insurance claim, etc.

==Medical declaration==
&lt;!--{{Main|Medical definition of death}}--&gt;
Most legal determinations of death in the developed world are made by medical professionals who pronounce death when specific criteria are met. Two categories of legal death are death determined by irreversible cessation of heartbeat and breathing (cardiopulmonary death), and death determined by irreversible cessation of functions of the brain  ([[brain death]]).  In the [[United States]], each state has laws for determining these two categories of death that are modeled after the [[Uniform Determination of Death Act]].

Cardiopulmonary criteria for death are met when a physician determines that efforts to restart  a stopped heart during [[cardiac arrest]] are futile, or that no attempt should be made to restart a stopped heart, such as when there is a [[Do not resuscitate|Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)]] order. In the latter case, irreversible is understood to mean that heartbeat and breathing cannot return on their own and will not be restored by medical intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =Controversies in the Determination of Death: A White Paper by the President's Council on Bioethics | publisher = bioethics.gov| year = 2008| pages = 84| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=2eVHEwTR5T8C&amp;pg=PA84| quote =For this reason, many have argued that the word "irreversible" in this context should be understood to mean "cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions under conditions in which those functions cannot return on their own and ''will not'' be restored by medical interventions."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brain death]] determinations are made in cases where breathing is [[mechanical ventilation|supported by machines]]. Brain death is determined by there being no signs of brain function during neurological examination of a person with a beating heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van der Lugt A |title=Imaging tests in determination of brain death |journal=Neuroradiology |volume=52 | issue=11 |pages=945–947  |date=November 2010 | doi=10.1007/s00234-010-0765-7 |pmid=20820765 |pmc=2952109 |quote=There is uniform agreement on the clinical neurological examination to evaluate absence of brain function. This examination includes the assessment of coma, the absence of brain reflexes, and the assessment of apnea.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmatory tests document either no [[cerebral blood flow|blood flow to the brain]], or no [[electroencephalography|brain electrical activity]] in absence of factors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Trauma: Critical Care| last1 = Wilson| first1 = William  C.|last2 = Grande| first2 = Christopher M.|last3 = Hoyt| first3 = David B.| edition = 1st | publisher = CRC Press| year = 2007| isbn = 978-0824729202| page = 133 | quote =  However, barbiturate coma, metabolic dysfunction (e.g. hepatic encephalopathy), severe  hypothermia (temperature &lt; 18°C), and other confounding factors may also produce cerebral  electric silence on EEG.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  known to produce reversible loss of brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van der Lugt A |title=Imaging tests in determination of brain death |journal=Neuroradiology |volume=52 | issue=11 |pages=945–947  |date=November 2010 | doi=10.1007/s00234-010-0765-7 |pmid=20820765 |pmc=2952109 |quote=Confirmatory tests can be classified into two categories: confirmation of loss of electrical activity (electroencephalography or somatosensory-evoked potentials) and demonstration of loss of cerebral blood flow (cerebral angiography, transcranial doppler ultrasonography, or cerebral scintigraphy).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike cardiopulmonary death which sometimes involves a decision not to resuscitate the heart, brain death is a determination that the brain biologically cannot be resuscitated.

If a [[clinical death|clinically dead]] person has suffered injuries so severe that resuscitation is obviously impossible, then in some jurisdictions [[first responder]]s may make a legal determination of cardiopulmonary death. Such a person is said to be [[dead on arrival|dead on arrival (DOA)]] or ''dead at the scene''.

==Presumption of death==
{{main|Declared death in absentia}}
In some cases, a person will be declared dead even without any remains or doctor's declaration. This is under one of two circumstances. First, if a person was known to be in mortal peril when last seen, they can often be declared dead shortly after. Examples would be the passengers of the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] that were not rescued after the ship sank. Second, if a person has not been seen for a certain period of time and there has been no evidence that they are alive. The amount of time that has passed varies by jurisdiction, from as little as four years in the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|US state of Georgia]] to twenty years in [[Italy]].

==False declarations of death==
There are three general categories where people may be falsely declared dead: by mistake, because of fraud, or as punishment for a crime.

===Mistaken presumption of death===
Sometimes people who are declared dead return and are unable to be declared alive. One study estimated that every year, the U.S. Social Security Administration declares 12,200 alive citizens as dead.&lt;ref&gt;https://priceonomics.com/what-its-like-to-be-declared-dead-by-the/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notable examples====

*Donald E. Miller Jr., an [[Ohio]] man declared legally dead in 1994. He resurfaced in 2013 and sued to be declared alive, but the court declined and ruled he was still legally dead.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/12/us/declared-legally-dead-as-he-sat-before-the-judge.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraudulent death===
In some cases, a legal declaration of death is fraudulent. Several people have [[Faked death|faked their own deaths]] for various reasons. The most common reasons for this are to [[life insurance fraud|collect insurance money]], to [[fugitive|avoid capture by police]] or to avoid paying debts.

At times, people declare other people dead for some benefit to themselves. For example, Constantin Reliu, a [[Romania]]n man living in Turkey was declared dead by his wife so that she could remarry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/romania-courts-constantin-reliu-vaslui-turkey-deported-death-certificate-legal-system-latest-a8262196.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/16/594431754/man-claims-hes-not-dead-court-doesn-t-buy-it&lt;/ref&gt; In India, several people have been fraudulently declared dead by family members wishing to steal land and other property. The best known is [[Lal Bihari]], who was fraudulently declared dead by family members, and was legally dead between 1975 and 1994. Bihari founded the [[Uttar Pradesh Association of Dead People|Association of Dead People]] to help others in similar situations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/24/world/azamgarh-journal-back-to-life-in-india-without-reincarnation.html&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being victims of fraud, it often takes many years to reverse a fraudulent death declaration, and at times it never happens. Bihari didn't get his declaration of death reversed until 1994, 19 years later,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and Reliu lost a court battle to be declared alive in 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===As punishment===
Historically, those who have committed crimes or other wrongs against the state have been declared legally dead despite being obviously alive. This is known as [[civil death]]. Such a person loses all rights normally granted a person. In jurisdictions that practiced civil death, it was legal to murder such a person, since they were not actually alive accordingly to the law, and therefore not actually killed.

==Investigation==
Determining manner of death often has important legal implications. Governments elect a [[coroner]] or appoint a [[medical examiner]], depending on jurisdiction, to both determine manner and cause of death, and if necessary, identify bodies when their identities are unknown. Manner of death is usually classified as [[natural death|natural]], [[accidental death|accidental]], [[homicide]], [[suicide]], pending or undetermined. A soldier is often listed as [[killed in action]] if the death was during military service. There are legal implications to all of the classifications.

==Estate==
{{main|Probate}}
In nearly all jurisdictions, dead people do not have the right to own property. When a person dies, their property needs to be distributed to others in a process called [[probate]]. People can specify their wishes before they die by preparing a [[will and testament]]. If there is no will, the laws of their country determine how the property is distributed. In most cases, it would go to [[next of kin]], such as a [[spouse]] or adult child. If the person who died is wealthy, often a portion of their property will be collected by an [[estate tax]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3748">'''MaryAnn T. Lippert'''  (born December 21, 1953) is a [[Wisconsin]] [[health education|health educator]], health administrator, and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican politician]] who served one term as a member of the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]]. She is currently [[executive assistant]] to the Secretary of the [[Wisconsin Department of Children and Families]].

== Background ==
Born in [[Marshfield, Wisconsin]], Lippert graduated from Pittsville High School. She received a
[[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] from the [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;La Crosse]] 1976, and an [[Master of Science|M.S.]] from the same university in 1980. She worked for many years as a health educator.

== Assembly ==
In 1998, she challenged fellow Pittsville resident and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] [[Donald W. Hasenohrl]] for the 70th Assembly District (portions of [[Portage County, Wisconsin|Portage]] and [[Wood County, Wisconsin|Wood]] counties) seat, coming close to defeating him (8,906 for Hasenohrl to 8,386 for Lippert) with $38,708 in campaign expenditures. Hasenohrl chose not to run for re-election in 2000, and Lippert defeated Democrat [[Amy Sue Vruwink]] by 104 votes (12,068 [50.2%] to 11,964 [49.8%]) in the 2000 general election, after spending $114,563.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.followthemoney.org/database/uniquecandidate.phtml?uc=16371|title=LIPPERT, MARYANN T - FollowTheMoney.org|website=www.followthemoney.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lippert served on the Assembly's Committees on Children and Families and Public Health (on both of which she served as Vice-Chair), as well as the Committees on Aging and Long-Term Care; Economic Development; Health; and Transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau ''State of Wisconsin 2001-2002 Blue Book'' Madison: Joint Committee on Legislative Organization, Wisconsin Legislature, 2001; pp. 69, 930.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, she chose not to run for re-election due to the health of her husband, Jerry, who was suffering from [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], which he atrributed to twenty years of smoking (he was a member of the state [[Tobacco Control Board]]). She was succeeded by Vruwink.&lt;ref&gt;Rinard, Amy. "Huelsman won't run for re-election" ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' May 29, 2002; p. 2B&lt;/ref&gt;

== After the legislature ==
After leaving the Assembly, Lippert went back to work in the health field. In February 2011, she was appointed as executive assistant to Eloise Anderson, the new Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families, as part of the administration of incoming governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]].

== Personal life==
Lippert is a mother of three children, and is a long-term resident of [[Pittsville, Wisconsin]], where she is a member of the [[Pittsville School District]] [[board of education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsville.k12.wi.us/dist_board.cfm|title=Pittsville Public School District - About Our School Board|website=www.pittsville.k12.wi.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dcfweb/newsletter/2011/february.htm "Serving Wisconsin Families" ''Ripples: DCF Employee Newsletter'' February 2011]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metadoxine''', also known as pyridoxine-pyrrolidone carboxylate, is a drug used to treat [[Alcoholism|chronic]] and [[Alcohol intoxication|acute alcohol intoxication]].&lt;ref name=addolorato/&gt; Metadoxine accelerates alcohol clearance from the blood.&lt;ref name=Von2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vonghia|first1=L|last2=Leggio|first2=L|last3=Ferrulli|first3=A|last4=Bertini|first4=M|last5=Gasbarrini|first5=G|last6=Addolorato|first6=G|last7=Alcoholism Treatment Study|first7=Group.|title=Acute alcohol intoxication.|journal=European journal of internal medicine|date=December 2008|volume=19|issue=8|pages=561-7|doi=10.1016/j.ejim.2007.06.033|pmid=19046719|url=http://www.ejinme.com/article/S0953620508000745/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metadoxine is an ion pair salt of [[pyridoxine]] and pyrrolidon carboxilate (PCA).&lt;ref name=addolorato/&gt; Pyridoxine (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is a precursor of coenzymes including [[Pyridoxal phosphate|pyridoxal 5’-phosphate]] (PLP), which accelerates the metabolic degradation of ethanol and prevents [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) inactivation by [[acetaldehyde]]. Pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzymes also play a role in the biosynthesis of four important neurotransmitters: [[serotonin]] (5-HT), [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]]: see [[Vitamin B6#Functions|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; functions]]. L-PGA is present in the diet and is produced endogenously by enzymatic conversion of gamma-glutamyl amino acids to L-PGA and free amino acids. In the central nervous system (CNS), L-PGA was found to have a role in composition of neuro-active molecules. Its production has been linked to hepatic gamma-glutamyl transferase activity and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH). Lastly, it was shown that L-PGA facilitates ATP synthesis by stimulating de novo synthesis of purines.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

==Medical uses==
As a treatment for alcohol intoxication and liver disease, metadoxine is typically given intravenously as immediate release formulation.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

===Acute alcohol intoxication===
In clinical studies, metadoxine has been reported to reduce half-life of ethanol in healthy volunteers and in acutely intoxicated patients; to accelerate the metabolism of alcohol and acetaldehyde into less toxic higher ketones and to improve their urinary clearance; to restore laboratory variables such as alcohol, ammonia, [[Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase|γ-GT]], and [[alanine aminotransferase]]; and to improve clinical symptoms of alcohol intoxication, including psychomotor agitation, depression, aggressiveness, and equilibrium disorders.&lt;ref name=addolorato/&gt;&lt;ref name=martinez/&gt; There is also evidence that metadoxine has an effect on reducing craving for alcohol.&lt;ref name=shpilenya/&gt; Data from clinical studies also support an effect of metadoxine on reducing indices of liver cell necrosis and fat accumulation in alcoholic fatty liver.&lt;ref name=shpilenya/&gt;

===Liver disease===
Metadoxine may block the differentiation step of preadipocytes by inhibiting CREB phosphorylation and binding to the cAMP response element, thereby repressing CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein b during hormone-induced adipogenesis.&lt;ref name=yang/&gt; Metadoxine, when given in an immediate release form in doses from 300&amp;nbsp;mg twice a day to 500&amp;nbsp;mg three times a day of up to 3 months, has been shown to improve biochemical indices of liver function as well as reduce ultrasonic evidence of fatty liver disease.&lt;ref name=caballeria/&gt;&lt;ref name=cacciatore/&gt;&lt;ref name=shenov/&gt;

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Metadoxine is a selective antagonist of the serotonin receptor subtype [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt;]] and displays high affinity to the [[GABA transporter|gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter]]. ''In vitro'' enzymatic assay revealed that metadoxine reduced the activity of the [[GABA transaminase]] enzyme, responsible for the degradation of GABA. Electrophysiological studies also showed that metadoxine increased inhibitory GABAergic synaptic transmission via a presynaptic effect. As it does not affect dopamine, norepinephrine or serotonin levels, metadoxine displays a novel mechanism of action as a monoamine-independent GABA modulator.&lt;ref name=alcobra/&gt;

In animal studies, metadoxine increased the activity of [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]] enzyme, prevented the decrease in alcohol dehydrogenase activity in chronic ethanol-fed rats, accelerated plasma and urinary clearance of ethanol, inhibited the increase of fatty acid esters in the liver of ethanol-treated rats, prevented the formation of [[fatty liver]] in rats exposed to a dose of ethanol sufficient to induce fatty liver, increased [[glutathione]] levels in the hepatocytes of acutely and chronically alcohol-intoxicated rats, prevented glutathione depletion, [[lipid peroxidation]] damage, collagen deposition, and [[Tumor necrosis factor alpha|TNF-α]] secretions induced by alcohol and acetaldehyde in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells.&lt;ref name=addolorato/&gt;

==History==
Metadoxine is predominantly used as metadoxine immediate release formulation in developing nations for acute alcohol intoxication and chronic alcoholic liver disease. Alternate names include:
* Abrixone (Eurodrug, Mexico)
* Alcotel (Il Yang, South Korea)
* Ganxin (Qidu Pharmaceutical, China)
* Metadoxil (Baldacci, Georgia; Baldacci, Italy; Baldacci, Lithuania; CSC, Russian Federation; Eurodrug, Colombia; Eurodrug, Hungary; Eurodrug, Thailand)
* NEXT LABS (India)
* Alkodez ІС (Ukraine)
* Viboliv (Dr. Reddy's, India)
* EXTOL (Next Labs, India)
* Xin Li De (Zhenyuan Pharm, China)&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt;

==Research==
===ADHD===
[[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders of childhood and is among the most prevalent chronic health conditions affecting school-aged children. The core symptoms of ADHD include inattention, difficulty staying focused, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.&lt;ref name=guideline/&gt;

Metadoxine exhibited cognition enhancing effect in the rat social recognition animal model.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

An extended release formulation of metadoxine (MDX), combining immediate and slow release formulations of metadoxine into a single oral dose, was developed to extend the half-life of the drug and to allow for the use of MDX in indications that require a longer therapeutic window, such as cognitive impairment-related disorders. MDX has demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvements in multiple measures of cognition, ADHD symptoms, and quality of life, across multiple studies of adults with ADHD.&lt;ref name=alcobra/&gt;

Several Phase II ADHD studies demonstrated a consistent signal of efficacy reaching statistical significance, as measured by neuropsychological testing (such as the computerized Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) in acute settings) and clinical scales (in chronic administration studies), with no treatment-related serious adverse events or major differences in adverse events profiles between drug and placebo groups.&lt;ref name=manor/&gt;&lt;ref name=manor2/&gt; The most common adverse events were nausea, fatigue, and headache.&lt;ref name=manor/&gt;&lt;ref name=manor2/&gt; A phase 3 study in 300 adults with ADHD was completed in 2014.&lt;ref name=weisler/&gt;

Alcobra Ltd., which was conducting the Phase III trial announced on January 17th 2017 that the drug had failed the trial. The failure announcement came a week after Alcobra won FDA agreement to review data collected to date in the MEASURE study and consider it in a future NDA submission of MDX for ADHD. The FDA also agreed to change a full clinical hold for the trial to a partial clinical hold pending review and approval of the company’s proposed protocol for a 6-month, Phase I study to assess the potential relevance of adverse findings observed in long-term animal studies of metadoxine in relation to human exposure, Alcobra said.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20171228154420/https://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/alcobra-adhd-candidate-mdx-fails-phase-iii-trial/81253721&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fragile X syndrome===
[[Fragile X syndrome]] (FXS) is a genetic disorder that is the most common single gene cause of intellectual disability and autism.&lt;ref name=hersh/&gt; Individuals with FXS often have a number of behavioral symptoms, including cognitive impairment, inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, autistic symptoms, shyness, aggression, anxiety, hand flapping, hand biting, and a high sensitivity to being touched.&lt;ref name=garber/&gt;&lt;ref name=hagerman/&gt; Autism spectrum disorder is seen in approximately 30% of males and 20% of females with FXS, and an additional 30% of FXS individuals display autistic symptoms without having the autism diagnosis.&lt;ref name=hersh/&gt; ADHD is commonly diagnosed in FXS and has been reported to occur in 59-80% of individuals with FXS.&lt;ref name=hersh/&gt;&lt;ref name=tranfaglia/&gt;

In a FXS animal model (Fmr1 knockout mouse model), metadoxine treatment improved behavioral impairments of learning, memory, and social interaction and reversed the overactivation of the biomarkers [[Protein kinase B|Akt]] and [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|extracellular signal-regulated kinase]] (ERK) in blood and brain of juvenile and adult mice. Metadoxine also demonstrated restoration of abnormal neuronal morphology as well as reduced the exaggerated basal protein production, both implicated in the pathophysiology of FXS and presumed to be responsible for impaired learning and memory.&lt;ref name=schumann/&gt;&lt;ref name=dolen/&gt;

The safety and efficacy of MDX in adolescents and adults with FXS has been evaluated in a Phase II study, which was completed in 2015.&lt;ref name=alcobra2/&gt;

{{Expand German|Gesundheits- und Krankenpfleger|date=September 2010}}

'''Nursing in Germany ''' is provided by different levels of professional and specialized practitioners. German-registered [[nurses]] are known as '''Gesundheits- und Krankenpfleger''' (''health- and sickness carer'').{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} Previously, the official name for a nurse practicing in Germany was ''Krankenschwester'' (female) and ''Krankenpfleger'' (male).

==Registration==
To become registered as a nurse, an individual needs to take and pass an official state exam in nursing. Different departments (in [Baden-Württemberg] f.i. the ''Regierungspräsidium'') are responsible for registration in different locations of the country.

==Education==
[[File:Krankenschwester doku1.jpg|thumb|A German nurse]]
In most cases, nurses learn the profession in a special nursing school that is often connected to a hospital. Before matriculating, individuals are required to complete several weeks of practical training in a hospital setting. The nursing course is completed according to [[EU regulations]], and is three years long, including around 2100 hours for theoretical knowledge and 2500 hours of practical training in different hospital settings.And then you can go to university to become a doctor if you want to.

==Salary==

In the first year of education, nurses are paid about 750-800 Euro per month. 
In the second year of education, nurses are paid about 800-900Euro a month.
In the third and last year of education, nurses are paid about 930-1030 Euro a month.

There are some changes to be expected in the future as it is now possible to study nursing on a B.Sc. basis (mostly in universities of applied sciences). But individuals still need to pass the official state exam to become a registered nurse. Some universities offer a special program with local nursing schools wherein students earn the B.Sc. and accordant state registration. Some universities offer post-graduate studies leading to a master's degree and the possibility to continue studies for a Ph.D. degree.

There are also nursing helpers who attend a one-year program in nursing school. This may change again with the introduction of university nursing curricula.

==Specializing==
There are different ways to specialize after the nursing schools, called ''Fachweiterbildung''. Salaries are typically higher with a ''Fachweiterbildung''. Specialization includes some 720–800 hours of theoretical education and practical training. In the end, there is a state exam or writing of a thesis. There are official two year specializations in:
*[[Intensive care unit|ICU]] and [[anesthesia]]
*OR
*[[oncology]]
*home care
*[[psychiatric]]
*[[palliative care]]
*quality management
*hygienic
*ward manager

It is possible for nurses to undergo a variety of shorter programs to continue learning and enhance their knowledge (e.g. wound management, oncology, palliative care, etc.).

==Working as a nurse==
In hospitals, there are mostly working registered nurses and nursing students. Registered nurses in [[Germany]] take care of the patients and there are different systems who and how the patients are treated: (a) taking care of a set of patients including all work that needs to be done or (b) taking care of the patients on a ward doing just one special function. Work includes ''planning'' based on the patients' needs and condition, ''documenting'', writing about the progress and current condition. ''Preparation of medication'' is in the hands of nurses and its ''application'': tablets, infusion etc. but not the i.v. application by syringe (except in the ICU). Blood samples and setup of venflos are not done by nurses (except in the ICU), but mostly done by students of medicine, even if it is in the curriculum. All basic care is done by registered nurses or coordinated and done by the nursing students. Special care like setting up [[urine catheters]], [[nasogastric tubes]], treatment of wounds and wound dressings are done by registered nurses or nurse students (under supervision).

==Job satisfaction==
[[Job satisfaction]] is very low in Germany because of the heavy work-load, low salaries and a low appreciation of the nurse profession in the public. Even some politicians in the past claimed that ''everybody is able to nurse''. The nurse associations are working hard to achieve the acceptance for the installation of nursing chairs in universities but they are often undermined by politicians who are looking for the cheapest work force but not skilled and professional workers.

==UK Nurses wanting to work in Germany==
In Germany, all nurses who want to work in their nursing profession have to have their qualification recognized by applying for an "Anerkennung". This is through the official administrative body responsible for licensing health care professionals which varies from state to state. Requirements include: language proficiency of level B2 in German, registration with the Nursing Midwifery Council (NMC), evidence of nursing education (including an academic transcript and degree certificate which may need to be translated into German), evidence of current residence, evidence of allowance to work in the EU, and evidence that your Nursing education meets the "EU Berufsanerkennungsrichtlinie/2005/36/EG" standards.

| Caption = Following a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH), an oocyte (immature egg cell) will be released into the uterine tube, where it will then be available to be fertilized by a male's sperm. Ovulation marks the end of the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle and the start of the luteal phase.

'''Ovulation''' is the release of [[egg cells|egg]]s from the [[ovaries]]. In humans, this event occurs when the [[ovarian follicle]]s rupture and release the secondary oocyte ovarian cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dukefertilitycenter.org/tests/ovulation-assessment/ Ovulation Test] at Duke Fertility Center. Retrieved July 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; After ovulation, during the [[luteal phase]], the egg will be available to be [[Human fertilization|fertilized]] by [[sperm]]. In addition, the [[uterus|uterine]] lining ([[endometrium]]) is thickened to be able to receive a fertilized egg. If no conception occurs, the uterine lining as well as blood will be shed during [[menstruation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Young, Barbara|title=Wheater's Functional Histology: A Text and Colour Atlas|edition=5th|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2006|isbn=9780443068508|page=359|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88tla60sHAUC&amp;pg=PA359|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MenstrualCycle2 en.svg|thumb|right|350px|Ovulation occurs about midway through the [[menstrual cycle]], after the [[follicular phase]], and is followed by the [[luteal phase]].

The process of ovulation is controlled by the [[hypothalamus]] of the brain and through the release of hormones secreted in the [[Anterior pituitary|anterior lobe]] of the [[pituitary gland]], [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH).&lt;ref name=Marieb&gt;{{cite book | last = Marieb | first = Elaine | title = Anatomy &amp; physiology | publisher = Benjamin-Cummings | location =  | page=915  | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780321887603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;       In the [[Follicular phase|preovulatory]] phase of the [[menstrual cycle]], the ovarian follicle will undergo a series of transformations called  cumulus expansion, which is stimulated by FSH. After this is done, a hole called the [[Stigma (anatomy)|stigma]] will form in the [[Ovarian follicle|follicle]], and the secondary oocyte will leave the  follicle through this hole. Ovulation is triggered by a spike in the  amount of FSH and LH released from the pituitary gland. During the [[luteal phase|luteal (post-ovulatory) phase]], the secondary oocyte will travel through the [[fallopian tubes]] toward the [[uterus]]. If [[fertilized]] by a [[sperm]], the fertilized secondary oocyte or ovum may [[Implantation (human embryo)|implant]] there 6–12 days  later.&lt;ref name="wilcox"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilcox AJ, Baird DD, Weinberg CR | title = Time of implantation of the Conceptus and loss of pregnancy | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 340 | issue = 23 | pages = 1796–1799 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10362823 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199906103402304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Follicular phase ===
{{See also|Folliculogenesis}}

The [[follicular phase]] (or proliferative phase) is the phase of the menstrual cycle during which the [[ovarian follicles]] mature. The follicular phase lasts from the beginning of [[menstruation]] to the start of ovulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Littleton, Lynna A.  |author2=Engebretson, Joan C.|title=Maternity Nursing Care|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781401811921|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nondhCqicAAC&amp;pg=PA195|accessdate=2013-11-09|date=2004-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gupta, Ramesh C.|title=Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology|publisher=Academic Press|year=2011|isbn=9780123820334|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGHRR32wz5MC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ovulation to be successful, the ovum must be supported by the [[Corona radiata (embryology)|corona radiata]] and [[cumulus oophorus|cumulus oophorous]] [[granulosa cell]]s. The latter undergo a period of proliferation and mucification known as cumulus expansion. Mucification is the secretion of a [[hyaluronic acid]]-rich cocktail that disperses and gathers the cumulus cell network in a sticky matrix around the ovum. This network stays with the ovum after ovulation and has been shown to be necessary for fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coveville.com/can-you-get-pregnant-after-ovulation/|title=Can You Get Pregnant after Ovulation?|website=coveville.com|access-date=3 Feb 2015|date=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/296751.php|title=Fertilization: your pregnancy week by week|website=medicalnewstoday.com|access-date=15 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An increase in cumulus cell number causes a concomitant increase in [[Follicular fluid|antrum fluid]] volume that can swell the follicle to over 20&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter. It forms a pronounced bulge at the surface of the ovary called the blister.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

=== Ovulation ===

[[Estrogen]] levels peak towards the end of the follicular phase. This causes a surge in levels of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH). This lasts from 24 to 36 hours, and results in the rupture of the ovarian follicles, causing the oocyte to be released from the ovary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Watson, Stephanie &amp; Stacy, Kelli Miller|chapter=The Endocrine System|editor=McDowell, Julie|title=Encyclopedia of Human Body Systems|publisher=Greenwood|year=2010|isbn=9780313391750|pages=201–202|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7tt1C1aJ0G4C&amp;pg=PA201|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through a signal transduction cascade initiated by LH, [[peptidase|proteolytic enzymes]] are secreted by the follicle that degrade the follicular tissue at the site of the blister, forming a hole called the ''stigma''. The [[secondary oocyte]] leaves the ruptured  follicle and moves out into the [[peritoneal cavity]] through the stigma, where it is caught by the [[Fimbria (female reproductive system)|fimbriae]] at the end of the [[fallopian tube]]. After entering the fallopian tube, the oocyte is pushed along by [[cilia]], beginning its journey toward the [[uterus]].&lt;ref name=Marieb/&gt;

By this time, the oocyte has completed [[meiosis|meiosis I]], yielding two cells: the larger [[ovum|secondary oocyte]] that contains all of the cytoplasmic material and a smaller, inactive first polar body. [[meiosis|Meiosis II]] follows at once but will be arrested in the [[metaphase]] and will so remain until fertilization. The [[spindle apparatus]] of the second meiotic division appears at the time of ovulation. If no fertilization occurs, the oocyte will degenerate between 12 and 24 hours after ovulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1340563 | pmid=3087519 | volume=292 | issue=6535 | title=Ovarian ultrasonography highlights precision of symptoms of ovulation as markers of ovulation | author=Depares J, Ryder RE, Walker SM, Scanlon MF, Norman CM | journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) | pages=1562 | doi=10.1136/bmj.292.6535.1562| year=1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1-2% of ovulations release more than one oocyte. This tendency increases with maternal age. Fertilization of two different oocytes by two different spermatozoa results in fraternal twins.&lt;ref name=Marieb/&gt;

The [[mucous membrane]]  of the [[uterus]], termed the functionalis, has reached its maximum size, and so have the [[endometrial]] glands, although they are still non-[[secretion|secretory]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

=== Luteal  phase ===
{{Main|Luteal phase}}

The follicle proper has met  the end of its lifespan. Without the oocyte, the follicle folds inward on  itself, transforming into the [[corpus luteum]] (pl. corpora lutea), a  steroidogenic cluster of cells that produces [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]]. These hormones induce the  endometrial glands to begin production of the [[endometrium|proliferative endometrium]] and later  into [[endometrium|secretory endometrium]], the site of embryonic growth if  implantation occurs. The action of progesterone increases [[basal body temperature]] by one-quarter to one-half degree  Celsius (one-half  to one degree Fahrenheit).  The corpus luteum continues this [[paracrine]]  action for the remainder of the menstrual cycle, maintaining the  endometrium, before disintegrating into scar tissue during menses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Usually, it occurs between the 10th and 20th day of your menstrual cycle|url=http://www.momjunction.com/ovulation-calculator/|accessdate=26 July 2016|work=momjunction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical  presentation==
{{further|Concealed ovulation|Fertility  awareness|Mittelschmerz}}
The start of ovulation can be detected by signs. Because the signs are not readily discernible by people other than the female, humans are said to have a [[concealed ovulation]]. In many animal species there are distinctive signals indicating the period when the female is fertile. Several explanations have been proposed to explain concealed ovulation in humans.

Females near ovulation  experience changes in the [[Cervix#Cervical mucus|cervical mucus]], and in their [[basal body temperature]]. Furthermore, many females experience secondary fertility signs  including [[Mittelschmerz]] (pain associated with ovulation) and a heightened sense of [[olfaction|smell]], and can sense the precise moment of ovulation.&lt;ref name="pmid12853171"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Navarrete-Palacios E, Hudson R, Reyes-Guerrero G, Guevara-Guzmán R | title = Lower olfactory threshold during the ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle | journal = Biol Psychol | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 269–79 |date=July 2003  | pmid = 12853171 | doi = 10.1016/S0301-0511(03)00076-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Beckmann, Charles R.B.|title=Obstetrics and Gynecology|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2010|isbn=9780781788076|pages=306–307|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0flWgd3OJLEC&amp;pg=PA306|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms related to the onset of ovulation, the moment of ovulation and the body's process of beginning and ending the menstrual cycle vary in intensity with each female but are fundamentally the same. The charting of such symptoms &amp;mdash; primarily basal body temperature, mittelschmerz and cervical position &amp;mdash; is referred to as the sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness, which allow auto-diagnosis by a female of her state of ovulation. Once training has been given by a suitable authority, fertility charts can be completed on a cycle-by-cycle basis to show ovulation. This gives the possibility of using the data to predict fertility for natural contraception and pregnancy planning.

The moment of ovulation has been photographed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7447942.stm  |title= article in BBC News|date=2008-06-12 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disorders ==

Disorders of ovulation are classified as [[menstrual disorder]]s and include oligoovulation and anovulation:

* Oligoovulation is infrequent or irregular ovulation (usually defined as cycles of greater than 36 days or fewer than 8 cycles a year)
* [[Anovulation]] is absence of ovulation when it would be normally expected (in a post-[[menarche|menarchal]], premenopausal female).  Anovulation usually manifests itself as irregularity of menstrual periods, that is, unpredictable variability of intervals, duration, or bleeding. Anovulation can also cause cessation of periods (secondary amenorrhea) or excessive bleeding ([[dysfunctional uterine bleeding]]).

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has developed the following classification of ovulatory disorders:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fh2hJDiLOyAC&amp;pg=PA54 Page 54] in: {{cite book |author1=Guillebaud, John |author2=Enda McVeigh |author3=Roy Homburg |title=Oxford handbook of reproductive medicine and family planning |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-920380-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* WHO group I: [[Hypothalamic–pituitary-gonadal axis]] failure
* WHO group II: Hypothalamic–pituitary-gonadal axis dysfunction. WHO group II is the most common cause of ovulatory disorders, and the most common causative member is [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Health and fertility in World Health Organization group 2 anovulatory female | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 586–599 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22611175 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dms019 | author1 = ESHRE Capri Workshop Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* WHO group III: [[Ovarian failure]]
* WHO group IV: [[Hyperprolactinemia]]

==Induction and  suppression==

===Induced ovulation===
{{Main|Ovulation induction}}
Ovulation  induction is a promising [[assisted reproductive technology]] for patients with conditions such as [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS)  and [[oligomenorrhea]]. It is also used in [[in vitro fertilization]] to make the follicles mature before [[egg retrieval]]. Usually, [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian stimulation]] is used in conjunction with [[ovulation induction]] to stimulate the formation of multiple oocytes.&lt;ref name=ivf.com/&gt; Some sources&lt;ref name=ivf.com/&gt; include ovulation induction in the definition of ''ovarian stimulation''.

A low dose of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (HCG) may be injected after completed ovarian stimulation. Ovulation will occur between 24–36 hours after the HCG injection.&lt;ref name=ivf.com&gt;[http://www.ivf.com/ovind.html IVF.com &gt; Ovulation Induction] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226141802/http://www.ivf.com/ovind.html |date=2012-02-26 }} Retrieved on Mars 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulation]] in some animal species occurs naturally, ovulation can be stimulated by coitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakker|first=J.|last2=Baum|first2=M. J.|date=July 2000|title=Neuroendocrine regulation of GnRH release in induced ovulators|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=220–262|doi=10.1006/frne.2000.0198|issn=0091-3022|pmid=10882541|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/91368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suppressed ovulation===
[[Contraception]] can be achieved by suppressing the ovulation.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The majority of [[Hormonal contraception|hormonal contraceptives]] and conception boosters focus on the ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle because it is the most important determinant of fertility. Hormone therapy can positively or negatively interfere with ovulation and can give a sense of cycle control to the female.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Estradiol and  progesterone, taken in various forms including [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s, mimics the hormonal levels of  the menstrual cycle and engage in negative feedback of folliculogenesis  and ovulation.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20501">'''Patient navigators''' educate and assist United States citizens in enrolling into health benefit plans stipulated in the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (ACA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=HealthCare.gov|url=https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/navigator/|website=http://healthcare.gov|publisher=HealthCare.gov|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patient navigators are also called "insurance navigators" or "in-person assisters" who have defined roles under the ACA. Although their roles might overlap, patient navigators are not [[community health worker]]s or [[health advocacy|health advocates]]. "Navigators" work in states with Federally-Facilitated Exchanges (FFEs) or State Partnership Exchanges.

Under the ACA, a [[health insurance marketplace]], or exchange, is required to develop and fund a patient navigator program. The patient navigator's primary role, as defined in section 1311, is to educate the public on information about health care plans, to facilitate enrollment into health plans, and provide information for tax credits and cost-sharing reductions. The education and information provided by patient navigators must be culturally and linguistically appropriate and provided in a fair and impartial manner. Patient navigators are required to meet standards and core proficiencies established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

== Standardization and Qualifications ==
=== Conflict-of-Interest Rules ===
Prior to certification and training, the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) require that all navigator and non-navigator individuals or entities seeking to facilitate public enrollment in plans disclose information that may result in a conflict of interest to exchanges and consumers.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;Kirchhoff, S. M. (2013, September 25). Health insurance exchanges: Health insurance "navigators" and in-person assistance (Congressional Report No. R43243). Washington DC: Library of Congress Congressional Research Service. Retrieved from [http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43243.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
This information includes:
* Lines of insurance that a navigator intends to sell;
* Existing or former employment relationships within 5 years with an issuer of health or [[Stop loss policy (insurance)]];
* Existing employment relationship between an individual's spouse or domestic partner and any issuer of health or stop-loss insurance; and,
* Existing or anticipated financial, business or contractual relationships with any issuer of health or stop-loss insurance.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;

If a navigator or non-navigator does have a conflict of interest while serving in their respective roles, they are to provide a plan for mitigating these conflicts. Failure to submit a mitigation plan will result in the inability to serve as a navigator and promote ACA health plan benefits.

=== Certification and Training Requirements ===
The ACA requires that all navigator and non-navigator personnel and entities be certified by the Federally-Facilitated Exchange or State Partnership Exchange through which they are funded.&lt;ref name=ref2 &gt;Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (2014, January). Assistance roles to help consumers apply &amp; enroll in health coverage through the marketplace. Retrieved from http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Health-Insurance-Marketplaces/Downloads/marketplace-ways-to-help.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Certification is provided upon completion of a training program approved by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS).

==== Certification Requirements ====
Navigators and non-navigators must first register with their exchange prior to completing a training program and qualifying for certification. Certification entails:
* Completing up to 30 hours of training,
* Passing an HHS-approved certification test, and
* Having the ability to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services ([http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/templates/browse.aspx?lvl=2&amp;lvlID=15 CLAS standards]) to individual and small business exchanges.&lt;ref name=ref3 &gt;Office of the Federal Register.

==== Navigator and Non-navigator Training ====
Training programs for navigators and non-navigators must be approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  The [http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNGenInfo/index.html?redirect=/MLNGenInfo Medicare Learning Network] is the primary source of HHS-approved training materials. Other approved programs include the:
* [http://www.hpfreemanpni.org/ Harold P. Freeman Patient Navigator Institute],
* [http://patientnavigatortraining.org/ Patient Navigator Training Collaborative], and
* [http://www.sonoma.edu/exed/patient-navigator/ Sonoma State University Patient Navigator Certificate Program].

State Exchanges may develop their own training programs, but they must also be approved by HHS. Training standards outlined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services include:&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt;
* Working with vulnerable and underserved populations
* Culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS standards)
* Ensuring services are accessible to people with disabilities
* Insurance affordability programs such as [[Medicaid]], [[State Children's Health Insurance Program|CHIP]] and other public programs
* Eligibility and enrollment rules and process
* Qualified health plans
* Differences between health plans
* Privacy, security, and customer service standards
* Outreach and education methods and strategies

== New York State Health Home Model ==
The Affordable Care Act of 2010, Section 2703, created an optional Medicaid State Plan benefit for states to establish Health Homes to coordinate care for people with Medicaid who have chronic conditions by adding Section 1945 of the Social Security Act. CMS expects states health home providers to operate under a “whole-person” philosophy. Health Home providers will integrate and coordinate all primary, acute, behavioral health, and long-term services and supports to treat the whole person. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gbuahn.org/members/about-us/health-homes|title=Health Home Description Buffalo NY|last=Media|first=Blue Dock|website=www.gbuahn.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== What is a “Health Home”? ===
A Health Home is a group of health and community agencies that have agreed to work together to help people with many health issues get what they need to keep them healthier and safer in the community. Each person who joins gets a “patient health navigator”. A patient health navigator will work closely with him/her to get the services he/she needs in his/her community. This service is being paid for through New York State Medicaid.

The '''Greater Buffalo United Accountable Healthcare Network''' (GBUAHN) was incorporated in 2009 by Raul Vazquez, M.D. &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raul_Vazquez_(physician)&lt;/ref&gt; as an Independent Physician Association (IPA) in Western New York. Many Medicaid beneficiaries suffer from multiple or severe chronic conditions and could potentially benefit from better coordination and management of the health and long-term services they receive, often in a costly disjointed and fragmented manner. The GBUAHN has adopted a strategy to achieve a more effective and efficient way to coordinate services to Medicaid participants. GBUAHN is a Lead Health Home with over 140 physician members located in Buffalo, Erie and other Western New York counties.

The GBUAHN is designed to be a person-centered system of care that facilitates access to and coordination of the full array of primary and acute physical health services, behavioral health care, and long-term community-based services and supports. Our Health Home model of service delivery expands on the traditional medical home models by building additional linkages and enhancing coordination and integration of medical and behavioral health care to meet the needs of people with multiple chronic illnesses. We emphasize comprehensive care in one setting, and we have the technology to diagnose a wide variety of medical conditions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gbuahn.org/members/about-us/about-gbuahn|title=Health Home GBUAHN Buffalo NY|last=Media|first=Blue Dock|website=www.gbuahn.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of GBUAHN is to improve health care quality and clinical outcomes as well as the patient care experience, while also reducing per capita costs through more cost-effective care.

=== NCQA Accreditation ===
GBUAHN was the first health home in the nation to receive NCQA accreditation in Case Management. Case management programs must prove they identify people in need of services, develop personalized care plans, monitor care goals to make adjustments when needed and manage communication among providers as people move between care settings. 

NCQA's mission is to improve health care for all Americans. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reportcards.ncqa.org/#/other-health-care-organization/Other_001G000001r1OyfIAE|title=NCQA Report Cards|website=reportcards.ncqa.org|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding Navigator or Non-navigator Programs ==
Section 1311(i) of the Affordable Care Act requires that each exchange develop a grant program to fund Navigators, organizations or individuals who facilitate education and enrollment in qualified health plans. Exchanges and their grant programs must meet a minimum set of standards.&lt;ref name=ref6&gt;Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (2013). PPHF – 2013 - Cooperative Agreement to Support Navigators in Federally-facilitated and State Partnership Exchanges. Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight. Retrieved from http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Funding-Opportunities/Downloads/2013-navigator-foa-4-9-2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are two primary sources of funding for in-person outreach, education, and assistance for enrolling in exchange health plans.

=== Navigator Funding for Federally-Facilitated Exchanges (FFEs) and State Partnership Exchanges ===
In April 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a cooperative agreement to support navigators in Federally-Facilitated Exchanges or State-Partnership Exchanges.&lt;ref name=ref6 /&gt; Up to $54 million from Prevention and Public Health Funds (PPHF) were initially set aside for funding navigators in all 34 states. Apportionment of funds were calculated based on the number of uninsured and non-elderly legal residents living in each state (with an FFE or State Partnership Exchange) divided by the total number of uninsured, non-elderly residents in all states with FFEs/State Partnership Exchanges. A minimum of $600,000 was available to all FFEs or State Partnership Exchanges to support navigation programs.
[[File:Uninsured residents under 65.jpg|thumb|Uninsured residents under 65. Source: Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services]]

Applicants eligible for this funding included entities, individuals, and consortia (any combination of two or more individuals, public organizations, or private organizations). Each applicant was eligible for one, non-renewable cooperative agreement award. Grant applications were reviewed based on the ranking of the application, scope of proposed activities, and total number and type of applications funded within each state. Each exchange must also have at least two different types of entities serve as navigators, "one of which must be a community and consumer-focused non-profit group." (Affordable Care Act Section 1311(i), 45 C.F.R. § 155.210)&lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt;

=== Funded Navigator Programs ===
On August 15, 2013, HHS announced $67 million in grants to 105 groups that applied to provide navigation in Federally-Facilitated Exchanges and State Partnership Exchanges.&lt;ref name=ref7&gt;Department of Human Health and Services. (2013, August 15). New resources available to help consumers navigate the health insurance marketplace. Retrieved from https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/08/20130815a.html.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional $13 million were transferred from the Prevention and Public Health Funds to boost the original $54 million dedicated to navigator funding earlier in the year.&lt;ref name=ref8&gt;Goodnough, A., (2013, August 15). $67 Million Awarded to Groups Helping With Health Law. The New York Times. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/us/politics/67-million-awarded-to-groups-helping-with-health-law.html?_r=0.&lt;/ref&gt; Navigator grantees included but were not limited to healthcare organizations and networks, non-profit organizations, universities, Indian tribes, faith-based institutions, and food banks.

:Largest navigator grants:
* United Way of Metropolitan Tarrant County, Texas, $5,889,181
* University of South Florida, 64 of 67 counties in Florida, $4,213,696
* Structured Employment Economic Development Corporation (SEEDCO), Georgia, $2,159,360
* Ohio Association of Foodbanks, $2,014,750
* North Carolina Community Care Networks, $1,988,428
* Michigan Consumers for Healthcare, $1,319,345

:A complete list of navigator grant recipients can be found [http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Health-Insurance-Marketplaces/Downloads/navigator-list-10-18-2013.pdf here].

=== Non-Navigator Funding for State Exchanges ===
State Exchanges are prohibited from using section 1311(a) grant funds to fund navigator programs.&lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt; However, State Exchanges and state partners in Consumer Partnership Exchanges can use section 1311(a) Exchange Establishment grants to fund non-navigator assistance programs such as in-person assistance programs. These non-navigator assistance programs "help ensure that the Exchange is providing outreach, education, and assistance to as broad a range of consumers as possible so that all consumers can receive help when accessing health insurance coverage through an Exchange." &lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt;

=== Potential Funding Issues ===
A September 2013 Congressional Research Service report notes two key issues related to navigator and non-navigator funding.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;
# Some lawmakers question Health and Human Services' authority to transfer Prevention and Public Health Funds to provide navigator grants.
# State Exchanges' ability to use Exchange Establishment grants to provide non-navigator outreach and education potentially creates large disparities in funding assistance by state. For example, Covered California, California's exchange, awarded $37 million in grants for in-person assistance. In contrast, Texas' FFE received $10.8 million in grants from CMS.

== Implementation of Navigator Programs ==
Many conservative states and members of Congress are demanding more oversight of patient navigator programs to protect consumers and their privacy.&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt; Others claim that passing laws to regulate navigators is an effort to hinder the implementation of the ACA. At least 16 states have enacted their own licensing and certification requirements in addition to federal requirements, which some suggest will reduce the availability of patient navigators. Some legislatures have also passed laws restricting the navigator's role, which can prevent navigators from performing some of their expected duties. States have passed various laws requiring navigator licenses, certifications, restrictions on offering advice, and burdensome financial requirements.&lt;ref name=ref9&gt;Ollove, Michael. (2013, September 9). Health Insurance Navigators Draw State Scrutiny. Stateline of Pew Chartiable Trust. Retrieved from http://www.pewstates.org/projects/stateline/headlines/health-insurance-navigators-draw-state-scrutiny-85899503315.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref10&gt;Giovannelli J, Lucia K, and Dash S. (2013, October 31). Under Pressure: An Update on Restrictive State Insurance Marketplace Consumer Assistance Laws. Commonwealth Fund. [Blog]. Retrieved from http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Blog/2013/Oct/Under-Pressure.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2013, twelve states have required either a state license or certification, and eight states have restricted the type of advice navigators are able to offer to consumers.&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt;

In Texas, navigators are required to undergo a background check and fingerprinting, provide proof of identity, and 20 hours of state-specific training in addition to the 20 hours of online training required by federal rules. One navigator group estimated that the additional training could cost an additional $400 per navigator.&lt;ref name=ref11&gt;Feibel, Carrie. (2014, January 23). Texas Issues Tough Rules For Insurance Navigators. Shots Health News from NPR. [Blog]. Retrieved from https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/01/23/265272504/texas-issues-tough-rules-for-insurance-navigators.&lt;/ref&gt; Texas is among at least 17 Republican-controlled states that have restricted navigator groups awarded federal grants to assist consumers in obtaining insurance coverage in the Exchanges.&lt;ref name=ref12&gt;Aaronson, Becca. (2014, January 22). Texas Imposes New Rules On Health Insurance Navigators. Kaiser Health News in partnership with the Texas Tribune. Retrieved from http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/January/22/Texas-Finalizes-Rules-for-Health-Care-Navigators.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Georgia, navigators must fulfill state licensure requirements and pass an [[Insurance broker|insurance broker's]] test, despite clear distinctions between brokers and navigators under federal law. Unlike brokers and agents, navigators cannot receive compensation from insurance companies and are prohibited from promoting a specific insurance plan.&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt;

Ohio, Missouri, Georgia, and Tennessee have passed laws preventing navigators from offering information about the features of a specific health plan. These laws prevent navigators from clarifying distinctions between plans in order to help consumers make informed decisions on obtaining appropriate coverage.&lt;ref name=ref10 /&gt;

Utah, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois require that navigators hold insurance or a surety bond against claims of wrongdoing or mistake. Federal regulations bar states from demanding navigators to maintain omissions or errors coverage.&lt;ref name=ref10 /&gt;

On Jan 23, 2014, a federal judge ruled on a Missouri case saying that states that have Federally-Facilitated Exchanges cannot enact state regulations on top of the federal regulations.&lt;ref name=ref11/&gt;

'''Prostate massage''' is the [[massage]] or stimulation of the male [[prostate]] gland for medical purposes or [[sexual stimulation]].

The prostate takes part in the [[Human sexual response cycle|sexual response cycle]], and is essential for the production of [[semen]]. Due to its proximity to the anterior rectal wall, it can be stimulated from the anterior wall of the [[rectum]] or externally via the [[perineum]].

==Medical uses==

===Digital rectal examination (DRE)===
Prostate massage is part of the digital [[rectal examination]] (DRE) routinely given to men by [[urologists]] in order to look for nodules of [[prostate cancer]] and to obtain an expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) specimen for [[microscopy]] and [[microbiological culture]] to screen for [[prostatitis]].

====Therapy for prostatitis====
{{Main article|Prostatitis}}
In the late 1990s, a small number of doctors tried prostate massage in conjunction with antibiotics for the treatment of [[Prostatitis#Category II: Chronic bacterial prostatitis|chronic bacterial prostatitis]] with uncertain results.&lt;ref name="pmid10527258"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nickel JC, Downey J, Feliciano AE, Hennenfent B |title=Repetitive prostatic massage therapy for chronic refractory prostatitis: the Philippine experience |journal=Techniques in Urology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=146–51 |year=1999 |pmid=10527258 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12496826"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shoskes DA, Zeitlin SI |title=Use of prostatic massage in combination with antibiotics in the treatment of chronic prostatitis |journal= Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases|volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=159–162 |year=1999 |pmid=12496826 |doi=10.1038/sj.pcan.4500308}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent trials, however, prostate massage was not shown to improve outcomes compared to antibiotics alone.&lt;ref name="pmid16566972"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ateya A, Fayez A, Hani R, Zohdy W, Gabbar MA, Shamloul R |title=Evaluation of prostatic massage in treatment of chronic prostatitis |journal=Urology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=674–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16566972 |doi=10.1016/j.urology.2005.10.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of these findings, prostate massage is not officially sanctioned in [[western medicine]] for the treatment of any medical disorder today. Prostatic massage should ''never'' be performed on patients with [[Prostatitis#Category I: Acute prostatitis (bacterial)|acute prostatitis]], because the infection can spread elsewhere in the body if massage is performed.&lt;ref name="pmid10584615"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nickel JC |title=Prostatitis: evolving management strategies |journal=The Urologic Clinics of North America |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=737–51 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10584615 |doi= 10.1016/S0094-0143(05)70215-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
Once the most popular therapeutic maneuver used to treat prostatitis, it was abandoned as primary therapy in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="pmid10374787"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nickel JC, Alexander R, Anderson R, Krieger J, Moon T, Neal D, Schaeffer A, Shoskes D |title=[Prostatitis unplugged? Prostatic massage revisited.] |journal=Tech Urol. |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10374787 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s the ineffectiveness of drug treatments for chronic prostatitis led to a brief resurgence of interest in prostate massage.&lt;ref name="pmid10527258"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12496826"/&gt; In a recent trial, however, prostate massage was not shown to improve outcomes compared to antibiotics alone.&lt;ref name="pmid16566972"/&gt;

The practice is still used in some parts of China.&lt;ref name="pmid18597833"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang J, Liu L, Xie HW, Ginsberg DA |title=Chinese urologists' practice patterns of diagnosing and treating chronic prostatitis: a questionnaire survey |journal=Urology |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=548–51 |year=2008 |pmid=18597833 |doi=10.1016/j.urology.2008.03.061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks===
Vigorous prostate massage has been documented to have injurious consequences:  periprostatic [[hemorrhage]],&lt;ref name="pmid14655640"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buse S, Warzinek T, Hobi C, Ackerman D |title=[Prostate massage with unwanted consequences.

===Electroejaculation===
[[Electroejaculation]] is a procedure in which nerves are stimulated via an electric probe, which is inserted into the rectum adjacent to the prostate. The stimulus voltage stimulates nearby nerves, resulting in contraction of the pelvic muscles and ejaculation. It is most commonly encountered in [[animal husbandry]] for the purpose of [[semen collection|collecting semen samples]] for testing or breeding. Some devices are used under general anesthesia on humans who have certain types of [[anejaculation]].&lt;ref name="human-electroej"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cornellurology.com/clinical-conditions/male-infertility/sperm-retrieval-techniques/electroejaculation/ |title=Electroejaculation |accessdate=2014-10-24 |publisher=Cornell Urology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510030803/https://www.cornellurology.com/clinical-conditions/male-infertility/sperm-retrieval-techniques/electroejaculation/ |archivedate=10 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electroejaculation is a different procedure from manual prostate massage.

==As a sexual practice==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

===General===
Prostate massage is also used for sexual stimulation, often in order to reach [[orgasm]]. It is possible for some men to achieve orgasms through [[prostate]] stimulation alone.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wibowo"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multiple Orgasms in Men—What We Know So Far|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293195654|last1=Wibowo|first1=Erik|last2=Wassersug|first2=Richard J.|year=2016|journal=Sexual Medicine Reviews|volume=4|issue=2|doi=10.1016/j.sxmr.2015.12.004|pmid=27872023|pages=136–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prostate is sometimes referred to as the "male [[G-spot]]" or P-spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hitting the P-Spot|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-red-light-district/201410/hitting-the-p-spot|website=Psychology Today|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men can achieve orgasm through stimulation of the prostate gland, such as prostate massage or receptive [[anal intercourse]], and men who report the sensation of prostate stimulation often give descriptions similar to females' accounts of G-spot stimulation.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=133–135|accessdate = May 18, 2014| isbn = 978-0618755714|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladas&gt;{{cite book |last=Ladas |first=AK |author2=Whipple, B |author3=Perry, JD  |title=The G spot and other discoveries about human sexuality |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |location=New York |year=1982 |isbn=978-0440130406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostate stimulation can produce a stronger, more powerful, and "deeper" orgasm than solely penile stimulation, described by some men as more widespread, intense, and enduring, and allowing for greater feelings of ecstasy than orgasm elicited by penile stimulation only.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; However, though the experiences are different, male orgasms by penile stimulation are also centered in the prostate gland.&lt;ref name="Lewin, Leap"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Ellen Lewin, William Leap, William L.

Prostate massage may also be a sexual practice in couples' sexual lives, although not as common. The availability of equipment and products for prostate massage can encourage people to try it. Many couples, though, do not purchase such devices but use a finger for anal penetration and prostate stimulation to enhance the man's orgasm. The finger or the prostate massager is introduced into the rectum through the anus and the prostate gland is gently massaged. The main problem in using the finger is that it may be too short to reach the prostate gland. Prostate massage can be performed individually or with the help of a partner.

There are safety matters relating to prostate stimulation and anal penetration. It is strongly recommended that plenty of lubricant be used with prostate massagers to prevent rectal lining damage. A smaller instrument or finger may be introduced gradually to minimize the discomfort that some may feel. Massagers may be used with or without a condom; however, because of the bacteria found in the rectum, if a condom is not used, it is very important to clean the tool with soap before use in another orifice or by a partner. Receiving anal stimulation may cause feelings of having to evacuate. More often than not, this is just a sensation that the stimulation causes and may take some getting used to.&lt;ref name="Ask Alice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/male-hot-spot-massaging-prostate |title= The male hot spot — Massaging the prostate |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equipment===
A ''prostate massager'' is a device for massaging the prostate gland. The shape of a prostate massager is similar to a finger, since prostate massages are traditionally given digitally (for example, via [[fingering (sexual act)|fingering]]). They usually have a slightly curved head to effectively massage the prostate. Lubricant is necessary before inserting anything into the anus, so a lubricant is used. Caution should be exercised when a prostate massager is used because of the sensitivity of the prostate. Correct use involves a medium to light repetitive [[massage]], or circular motion—the device being used to administer the massage should not thrust.

Prostate massage equipment ranges from [[dildo]]s to [[butt plug]]s and [[G-Spot vibrator]]s.  When used in sexual practice, prostate massagers are commonly referred to as "prostate toys", "prostate [[sex toys]]", and "anal toys". These prostate massagers are inserted into the [[rectum]] through the anus and are intended to stimulate the prostate by simple massaging or vibrating. They are used during [[foreplay]] by many couples.

Prostate dildos are similar to vaginal dildos, but they tend to be more curved, slimmer and with a softer texture. Some of the new prostate dildos on the market are driven by [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and offer vibration at the tip; the speed or intensity of which may be changed depending on the subject's personal preference. Unlike vaginal dildos, the anal prostate massager has a flared end to prevent it from being fully inserted and 'lost' inside the rectum.

Some men prefer butt plugs, which are easy to use, can be inserted freely and left in place while the man's hands are free for other sexual activities such as [[masturbation]]. Anal plugs also come in various shapes, sizes and designs and are not commonly intended to stimulate the prostate.  Newer, more angled models (second generation) of prostate massagers have been developed to provide a more direct and thorough massage of the prostate gland.&lt;ref name="Helix"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aneros.com/prostate-massagers/helix/|title=Aneros Helix|accessdate=2010-04-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401063732/http://www.aneros.com/prostate-massagers/helix/|archivedate=1 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new devices feature a more curved shape and are slightly longer than the originals. They commonly have a narrow neck and a flared end to avoid losing them in the rectum.  While many massagers rely upon the body's own natural muscular contractions of the anal sphincter and anal wall to stimulate the prostate, some of the newer models come with vibrators built into them to increase sexual pleasure.

A G-spot vibrator can be used as a prostate massager as long as it is handled carefully and is provided with a safety base that will not allow it to be lost in the rectum. Vibrators for prostate stimulation usually have a pronounced curve at the end.

'''''R v Davidson''''', also known (particularly among medical practitioners) as the '''Menhennitt ruling''',&lt;ref name="R v Davidson"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|85|1969|litigants=R v Davidson (Menhennitt ruling) |parallelcite=[1969] [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 667 |date=3 June 1969 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a significant ruling delivered in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]] on 26 May 1969. It concerned the legality of [[abortion]] in the [[Australia]]n [[states and territories of Australia|state]] of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The ruling was not the end of the case, but rather answered certain [[question of law|questions of law]] about the admissibility of [[evidence]], so as to allow the [[trial]] to proceed.

In the ruling, Justice [[Clifford Menhennitt|Menhennitt]] ruled that abortion might be lawful if necessary to protect the physical or mental health of the woman, provided that the danger involved in the abortion did not outweigh the danger which the abortion was designed to prevent. It was the first ruling on the legality of abortion in any part of Australia. The principles put forward by Justice Menhennitt have since been drawn upon in other parts of the country.

==Background to the ruling==

Charles Davidson, a medical doctor, was charged with four counts of unlawfully using an instrument to procure the [[miscarriage]] of a woman, and one count of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiring]] to do the same, offences prohibited in the Victorian [[Crimes Act 1958]]. When Justice Menhennitt gave this ruling, the trial had been going for eight days. The [[prosecutor|prosecution]] was about to call expert medical testimony, and Menhennitt anticipated that the admissibility of that evidence might be challenged, so he decided to rule on certain questions of law in advance.

The relevant section of the Crimes Act, section 65, stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whosoever... with intent to procure the [[miscarriage]] of any woman whether she is or is not with child unlawfully administers to her or causes to be taken by her any [[medical abortion|poison or other noxious thing]], or unlawfully uses [[Abortion#Surgical|any instrument or other means]] with the like intent, shall be guilty of a [[felony]], and shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than fifteen years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{As of|2006|alt=As of March 2006}}, the only subsequent change to this law is in the classification of the crime, from felony to [[indictable offence]]. The remainder of the wording remains the same. Menhennitt discussed the background of the section, saying that it was drawn from an 1861 [[England|English]] law, the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], which in turn derived from English laws from 1837, 1828 and 1803.

==Arguments==
The main issue to be considered was what the word "unlawfully" meant in this context. Justice Menhennitt noted that the inclusion of the word implied that some abortions might be lawful. The word "unlawfully" had also appeared in the earlier English legislation from which the Victorian law had derived, and the same word was also used in earlier [[common law]] [[indictment]]s. The word was not defined in any of those statutes, although in the [[United Kingdom]] the [[Abortion Act 1967]] had been passed in the meantime, which provided a definition of when abortions were lawful. That legislation had no equivalent in Victoria however, and "unlawfully" remained undefined.

===English precedent===
The only case that had specifically considered what "unlawfully" meant in the context of abortion was a 1938 English case heard in the [[Assize Court|Courts of Assize]], ''[[R v Bourne]]''. In that case, Dr Bourne was charged with the crime of abortion under section 58 of the Offences Against The Person Act 1861 (the same section on which the Victorian law drew). During his summing up, the [[trial judge]] instructed the [[jury]] that "no person ought to be convicted [of the crime of abortion] unless the jury are satisfied the act was not done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother."&lt;ref name="R v Bourne"&gt;''[[R v Bourne]]'' [1938] 3 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 615&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 617}} The trial judge said that first this was the appropriate definition of abortion at common law, and secondly that although particular wording did not appear in the definition of the crime of abortion, it did appear in the definition of the crime of [[child destruction]] (which applies when a person kills a child during childbirth), and that the word "unlawfully" in the definition of abortion implied that the wording should also apply to abortion.

The trial judge continued, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I think those words ought to be construed in a reasonable sense, and, if the doctor is of opinion, on reasonable grounds and with adequate knowledge, that the probable consequence of the continuance of the pregnancy will be to make the woman a physical or mental wreck, the jury are quite entitled to take the view that the doctor who, under those circumstances and in that honest belief, operates, is operating for the purpose of preserving the life of the mother.&lt;ref name="R v Bourne"/&gt;{{rp|p 619}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justice Menhennitt described why the proviso from the definition of child destruction in the English legislation should also apply to the definition of abortion, by pointing out that under another provision of the same law, abortion was an [[alternative charge]] to child destruction and vice versa (that is, the jury could choose to substitute one charge for the other). As such, there was a strong argument to say that the same proviso should apply to both.

However, as Justice Menhennitt pointed out, the Victorian definition of child destruction (in section 10 of the Crimes Act) does not include the proviso in the English legislation; instead, it simply says "unlawfully". As such, that argument would not apply in Victoria, and "what is lawful and what is unlawful must be determined by other legal principles."&lt;ref name="R v Davidson"/&gt;{{rp|p 670}}

===Necessity===

Justice Menhennitt then considered a discussion of ''R v Bourne'' by Glanville Williams, in his book ''The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law'', in which Williams said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The judge's direction to the jury, which resulted in Mr. Bourne's acquittal, is a striking vindication of the legal view that the defence of necessity applies not only to common law but even to statutory crimes. It is true that the direction proceeded in some slight degree on the analogy of the child destruction statute, which contains an express exemption for the preservation of the life of the mother; but the exception in the one statute was not in itself a ground for reading a similar exception into the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Glanville |last=Williams |year=1958 |title=The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law |edition=1 |publisher=[[Faber &amp; Faber]] |location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On this basis, although there were differences in the Victorian legislation, the definition in ''R v Bourne'' of "unlawfully" in the context of abortion could indeed be useful in Victoria, if recognised as an expression of the common law [[defense (legal)|defence]] of [[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]].

Justice Menhennitt discussed various definitions of necessity, noting that the concepts of necessity and proportion are usually present. He also quoted a test for necessity laid down by a previous decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria in ''[[R v MacKay]]'', a case about the killing of an escaping prisoner:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the test laid down by the law today for determining whether the homicide is justifiable or not is a twofold test which may be stated in this form: (1) Did the accused honestly believe on reasonable grounds that it was necessary to do what he did in order to prevent the completion of the felony or the escape of the felon? and (2) Would a reasonable man in his position have considered that what he did was not out of proportion to the mischief to be prevented?&lt;ref name="R v MacKay"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|79|1957|litigants=[[R v MacKay]] |parallelcite=[1957] [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 560  at 573 |date=16 April 1957 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the context of abortion under Victorian law, this principle of necessity would mean that anyone performing a termination would have to have an [[Subjective and objective standard of reasonableness|honest and reasonable belief]] that conducting the termination was necessary to prevent some serious harm from occurring to the woman. Thus the test would be a subjective one, with the requirement that the beliefs be held reasonably.

==Judgment==
Justice Menhennitt decided in favour of using the principle of necessity to give substance to "unlawfulness" in this context. He expressed a test for deciding whether a termination would be unlawful or not in this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the use of an instrument with intent to procure a miscarriage to be lawful the accused must have honestly believed on reasonable grounds that the act done by him was (a) necessary to preserve the woman from a serious danger to her life or her physical or mental health (not being merely the normal dangers of pregnancy and childbirth) which the continuance of the pregnancy would entail; and (b) in the circumstances not out of proportion to the danger to be averted.&lt;ref name="R v Davidson"/&gt;{{rp|p 672}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Consequences==
The trial proceeded, and Davidson was found not guilty by the jury on all five charges, on 3 June 1969.

The primary significance of the decision was that it referred to both physical and mental health of the mother as a factor in a lawful abortion.

The principles in the ruling were largely adopted in the state of [[New South Wales]] by the [[District Court of New South Wales]] in 1971 in the case of ''[[R v Wald]]'',&lt;ref name="R v Wald"&gt;''[[R v Wald]]'' (1971) 3 {{abbr|NSW DCR|New South Wales District Court Reports}} 25. Confirmed in {{cite AustLII|NSWSC|103|1995|litigants=CES v Superclinics (Australia) Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1995) 38 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 47 |courtname=[[NSW Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which also involved the prosecution of a doctor for performing a termination. That case expanded the definition slightly, by pointing out that "it would be for the jury to decide whether there existed in the case of each woman any economic, social or medical ground or reason which in their view could constitute reasonable grounds upon which an accused could honestly and reasonably believe there would result a serious danger to her physical or mental health".&lt;ref name="R v Wald"/&gt; In the state of [[Queensland]], the principles in the Menhennitt ruling were cited in the 1986 case of ''[[R v Bayliss &amp; Cullen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Bayliss &amp; Cullen]]''  (1986) 9 Queensland Lawyer Reports 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In the other states, and in the [[Northern Territory]] (but not the [[Australian Capital Territory]]), legislation has been adopted to define which abortions are legal and which are not.

In 1974, the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam government]] provided that [[Medibank]] (now called Medicare) benefits could be paid to women who underwent a termination procedure. In 1979, however, there was a motion in the [[Australian House of Representatives]] from [[Stephen Lusher]] to end medical benefits for terminations, and the debate spilled over to the legality of abortion. Although the decisions in ''Davidson'' and ''Wald'' were fiercely criticised by some members of parliament, who insisted that abortion was still illegal, others defended the validity of the decisions. Former [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Billy McMahon]] said "it has been stated rather foolishly, by a member not very closely attuned to the law - that there has been no appeals. But there could have been an appeal. There was no restriction in either State, Liberal Country Party or Labor government as to appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pringle, Helen|year=2005|title=The abortion debate: what a fizzer!|work=On Line Opinion|url=http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=3116|accessdate=2006-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some disquiet from the anti-abortion lobby, no appeals have been lodged against the Menhennitt ruling or the other decisions, and in most states there have been no successful prosecutions for consensual abortion since those decisions. Anti-abortion writers contend that most abortions remain illegal, and that the courts and the prosecutors are lax in protecting the rights of unborn children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Greg |editor=O'Donovan, Margaret |editor2=Stuparich, Jeremy |title=The Abortion Debate: Pro-Life Essays |url=http://www.actrtla.org.au/abortion/bookab/smith.htm |year=1994 |publisher=ACT Right to Life Association |location=[[Canberra]] |isbn=0-9598444-8-1 |chapter=Abortion Law in Australia with Particular Reference to New South Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators argue that calling abortion technically illegal is incorrect, or otherwise pointless, since that is "a meaningless category in law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pringle, Helen|year=2005|title=The abortion debate: what a fizzer!|work=On Line Opinion|url=http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=3116|accessdate=2006-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, after a conscience vote in the Victorian parliament, legislation reforming abortion laws was passed.  The new law legalizes abortion on request up to 24 weeks pregnancy; after that time, two doctors must certify that they "reasonably believe that the abortion is appropriate in all the circumstances", with those circumstances encompassing "all relevant medical circumstances; and the woman's current and future physical, psychological and social circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/bill/alrb2008219/ Abortion Law Reform Bill 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rangil water treatment plant''' is situated on rangil mountain of [[Ganderbal district]] about 21&amp;nbsp;km from commercial centre of [[Kashmir]].
&lt;ref&gt;wikipamia. http://wikimapia.org/13346459/WATER-TREATMENT-PLANT-GANDERBAL-muneer&lt;/ref&gt; The water project was inaugurated by [[Dr.Farooq Abdullah]] on 15 March 2010 and its cost was estimated as Rs 31 crore.

==Construction==

The project was completed by Economic Reconstruction Agency (ERA) and was handed over to Public Health Engineering department of Kashmir on the same day.&lt;ref name="greaterkashmir"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/2010/Mar/15/cm-to-inaugurate-rangil-water-project-today-81.asp | title=greaterkashmir | accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main aim of the project was to provide fresh drinking water to the people of [[Srinagar]]. The construction company under Rangil water supply project has liad 51.63&amp;nbsp;km long pipeline which has been tested for efficiency across the city.&lt;ref name="greaterkashmir"/&gt;

==Features==
The filtration plant has water storing capacity of 10 MGD (million gallons per day). The water in the plant comes from [[Sind River]] which runs through the heart of [[Ganderbal district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ganderbal.nic.in/About.html | title=Rangil water treatment in Ganderbal district | accessdate=21 August 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423044143/http://ganderbal.nic.in/About.html | archivedate=23 April 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The water treatment plant is also installed with electromagnetic and mechanical flow meters at the control room of the plant and at bifurcation points  to regulate [[water supply]] as per demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/2010/Mar/15/cm-to-inuagrate-rangil-water-project-today-81.asp | title=Electromagnetic and Mechanical flow meters | accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Treatment process==
The water entering the plant at the first place undergoes screening and after that [[alum]] is added to aid [[sedimentation]].  The setter water enters  10 filtration units from where it is transported for disinfection using chlorine in disinfection unit. The water thus obtained is stored in storage reserviours for supply purposes.

Warshak graduated from Brooklyn's [[Midwood High School]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://midwoodhighschool.net/brooklyn-ny/alumni-list-w.html Midwood High School Brooklyn, NY Alumni List]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1966 and received his B.S. degree from [[Cornell University]] in 1971. Warshak received his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center]] (formerly the UT Health Science Center) in 1978. He is a past Clinical Professor of Psychology in the Department of Psychiatry at UT Southwestern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/graduate-school/programs/phd-degrees/clinical-psychology/program-faculty.html UT Southwestern Clinical Psychology Faculty]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Warshak's doctoral dissertation, ''The Effects of Father Custody and Mother Custody on Children's Personality Development'',&lt;ref&gt;Warshak, R. A. (1978). ''The Effects of Father Custody and Mother Custody on Children’s Personality Development''. Doctoral dissertation, University of Texas Health Science Center, Dallas, TX.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first study to directly compare children growing up in father-custody homes to children growing up in mother-custody homes.&lt;ref name="Time 1980"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924414,00.html Behavior: Woe Is One]. (1980, September 8).''Time'', ''116'' (10).&lt;/ref&gt; Warshak collaborated with John Santrock on the Texas Custody Research Project, a series of studies on the effects of different custody dispositions and stepfamilies, partially funded by the [[National Institute of Mental Health]].

Warshak's studies on father and mother custody, remarriage, relocation, parenting plans for young children, the [[American Law Institute]]'s approximation rule, children's preferences in custody disputes and parental alienation appear in 13 books and more than 75 articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warshak.com/media/speaking.html Dr. Richard Warshak's Speaking Engagements]. www.warshak.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Warshak's studies are cited often in the professional literature&lt;ref&gt;Hague Conference on Private International Law, Permanent Bureau, Child Abduction/Protection of Children (2012).

In 2014 the [[American Psychological Association]] published Warshak’s paper, ''Social Science and Parenting Plans for Young Children: A Consensus Report'', in the journal [[Psychology, Public Policy, and Law]]. The paper was endorsed by 110 researchers and practitioners who added their names to the paper, “a rare occurrence in social science.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/03/ohio_legislators_should_suppor.html Ohio legislators should support shared parenting and parental equality], by Professor Donald Hubin: “[T]he American Psychological Association published a report by prominent psychologist Richard Warshak, titled "Social Science and Parenting Plans for Young Children: A Consensus Report," that concluded shared parenting should be the norm. What's more, the conclusions were endorsed by 110 researchers and practitioners who added their names to the paper -- a rare occurrence in social science."&lt;/ref&gt; The endorsers, from fifteen countries, include the world’s leading authorities in early child development, parent-child relationships, and divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, L. (2015). Pop Goes the Woozle: Being Misled by Research on Child Custody and Parenting Plans, ''Journal of Divorce &amp; Remarriage'', ''56'', 595–633. DOI: 10.1080/10502556.2015.1092349 "In the group that endorsed the Warshak paper, there were 11 people who had held major office in professional associations, such as a former president of the American Psychological Association; 5 university vice-presidents, provosts, or deans; 14 professors emeriti; 17 department chairs; 61 full professors; 16 members of the American Board of Professional Psychologists (ABBP), and eight professors with endowed chairs. Others were leading attachment researchers, the current editor of the major journal on attachment, and leading daycare and early child development researchers."&lt;/ref&gt; The paper has been translated into more than eighteen languages and has informed parliamentary deliberations in several countries including the U.K., Canada, Israel, Finland, and Sweden.

Warshak was a founding member and past president of the Dallas Society for Psychoanalytic Psychology and was the founding editor of the DSPP Bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;Brix, D. J.(1994). [http://www.dspp.com/papers/brix.htm Dallas Society for Psychoanalytic Psychology: A brief history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113073057/http://www.dspp.com/papers/brix.htm |date=2011-11-13 }}. In R. C. Lane and M. Meisels (Eds.), ''A History of the Division of Psychoanalysis of the American Psychological Association''.  Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warshak has several op-ed columns published in U.S. newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/commentary/sdut-custody-divorce-children-2016apr08-story.html Making kids chose not wise in custody battles]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 he was one of the original team of authors invited to launch the Divorce section of the ''[[Huffington Post]].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-warshak/ The Huffington Post: Richard Warshak].&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the four contributors selected to inaugurate the Child and Family Blog co-sponsored by [[Princeton University]], [[Brookings Institution]], [[University of Cambridge]], and the Jacobs Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://childandfamilyblog.com/about/ About the Child and Family Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parental alienation==
Warshak's 2010 set of three articles on Family Bridges: A Workshop for Troubled and Alienated Parent-Child Relationships triggered a resurgence of interest among professionals in parental alienation and prompted the ''Family Court Review'' to devote a whole issue to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Fidler, B. J. &amp; Bala, N. (2010). Guest Editors’ Introduction To Special Issue On Alienated Children In Divorce And Separation: Emerging Approaches For Families And Courts. ''Family Court Review, 48'' (1), 6-9. “The impetus for this special issue arises from the preparation of a paper by Richard Warshak that was submitted for publication in FCR. His article 'Family Bridges: Using Insights from Social Science to Reconnect Parents and Alienated Children' is the first to appear in a refereed journal on the workshop. It went through a rigorous peer-review process before being accepted for publication” (page 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

Warshak analyses the controversy about whether  a child's unreasonable alienation from a parent constitutes a syndrome and presents arguments both for and against the use of the term, [[parental alienation syndrome]], in court.&lt;ref&gt;Warshak, R. A. (2003). Bringing Sense to Parental Alienation: a Look at the Disputes and the Evidence. ''Family Law Quarterly, 37'', 273-301.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warshak stresses the importance of understanding the multiple roots of parental alienation and the various factors, including the behavior of the rejected parent, that contribute to the origin and maintenance of a child’s unreasonable alienation or estrangement from a parent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S219PgIg2z8 In Focus: Divorce Poison (2010-02-19)]. PBS KNME-TV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warshak, supra note 3 at 61-62: "Relief from alienation requires an understanding of all the contributing factors.The child may have her own motives, the rejected parent may be responding in a rigid manner that reinforces the negative attitudes, and the favored parent may be actively or passively supporting the rupture of the parent-child relationship. In additron to the actions of the parents and child, sometimes the circumstances of the marriage and divorce play a key role."  Warshak, supra note 3 at 63: "The search for the roots of alienation is not a quest to place blame but to find effective solutions to this tragic problem."&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the emotional and financial costs of severe irrational alienation, and the obstacles to its alleviation, Warshak emphasizes the  importance of directing educational resources and judicial efforts to the goals of prevention and early identification of children at risk. The DVD he co-authored and co-produced, ''Welcome Back, Pluto: Understanding, Preventing, and Overcoming Parental Alienation'', is the first such program for children, teens, and young adults who are alienated or at risk for becoming alienated.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, D. L., &amp; Sauber, S. R. (2011). Review of the DVD Welcome Back, Pluto: Understanding, Preventing, and Overcoming Parental Alienation. ''The American Journal of Family Therapy, 39'', 77-85.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to education, Warshak stresses the importance of courts' rapid and effective enforcement of orders related to children's contact with both parents.&lt;ref&gt;Pigg, S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5490">{{Other uses|Pink elephant (disambiguation)}}
"'''Seeing pink elephants'''" is a [[euphemism]] for drunken [[hallucination]] caused by [[alcoholic hallucinosis]] or [[delirium tremens]]. The term dates back to at least the early 20th century, emerging from earlier idioms about snakes and other creatures. An alcoholic character in [[Jack London]]'s 1913 novel ''[[John Barleycorn (novel)|John Barleycorn]]'' is said to hallucinate "blue mice and pink elephants".

==History of the euphemism==
For many decades before "pink elephant" became the standard drunken hallucination, people were known to "see snakes" or "see snakes in their boots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jensen Brown|first1=Peter|title=The Colorful History and Etymology of "Pink Elephant"|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-colorful-history-and-etymology-of.html|website=Early Sports 'n' Pop-Culture History|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in about 1889, and throughout the 1890s, writers made increasingly elaborate modifications to the standard "snakes" idiom.  They changed the animal to rats, monkeys, giraffes, hippopotamuses or elephants – or combinations thereof; and added color – blue, red, green, pink – and many combinations thereof.  

In 1896, for example, in what may be the earliest recorded example of a (partially) pink elephant, one of Henry Wallace Phillips' "Fables of our Times" referred to a drunken man seeing a "pink and green elephant and the feathered hippopotamus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=Henry Wallace|title=The Man and the Serpent|journal=Life|date=April 30, 1896|volume=27|issue=696|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1897, a humorous notice about a play entitled "The Blue Monkey," noted that, "We have seen it.  Also the pink elephant with the orange trunk and the yellow giraffe with green trimmings.  Also other things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024441/1897-12-06/ed-1/seq-4/|title=A Candid Editor|agency=''St. Paul Dispatch'' |newspaper=The Evening Times |location=Washington DC|date=December 6, 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early literary use of the term is by Jack London in 1913, who describes one kind of alcoholic, in the autobiographical ''John Barleycorn'':&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are, broadly speaking, two types of drinkers. There is the man whom we all know, stupid, unimaginative, whose brain is bitten numbly by numb maggots; who walks generously with wide-spread, tentative legs, falls frequently in the gutter, and who sees, in the extremity of his ecstasy, blue mice and pink elephants. He is the type that gives rise to the jokes in the funny papers.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:John Barleycorn (London)/Chapter II|''John Barleycorn'' Chapter II, at Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Pink elephants" became the dominant animal of drunken-hallucination choice by about 1905, although other animals and other colors were still regularly invoked.  "Seeing snakes" or "seeing snakes in one's boots" was in regular use into the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jensen Brown|first1=Peter|title=The Colorful History and Etymology of "Pink Elephant"|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-colorful-history-and-etymology-of.html|website=Early Sports 'n' Pop-Culture History|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known reference to pink elephants occurs in the [[1941 in film|1941]] [[Walt Disney|Disney]] animated film ''[[Dumbo]]''. Having taken a drink of water from a bucket spiked with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]], Dumbo and Timothy begin to hallucinate singing and dancing elephants in a segment known as "[[Pink Elephants on Parade]]".

Pink elephants do exist in nature, as it is possible for [[albino]] elephants to be pink, as well as white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rebecca |last=Morelle |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7951331.stm|title=Pink elephant is caught on camera|publisher=BBC News |date=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product references==
The association between pink elephants and alcohol is reflected in the name of various alcoholic drinks. There are various cocktails called "Pink Elephant",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bouchard|first1=Cathy|last2=Foley|first2=Ray|title=Ultimate Little Cocktail Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZBfeM7_-YQC&amp;pg=PT31|date=2011-11-01|publisher=Sourcebooks|isbn=9781402254109|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Huyghe Brewery put a pink elephant on the label of its [[Delirium Tremens (beer)|Delirium Tremens]] beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hln.be/regio/nieuws-uit-aalter/brouwerij-boos-over-roze-olifant-a2136024/|title=Brouwerij boos over roze olifant|last1=Seymortier|first1=J.|first2=J. |last2=Eeckhout|work=[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]|language=Dutch|date=29 November 2014 |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other meanings==

In 2008, Republican vice-presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] used the phrase "pink elephants" to refer to conservative women such as herself, [[Carly Fiorina]], [[Sue Lowden]] and [[Jane Norton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/05/14/palin-look-out-for-stampede-of-pink-elephants/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Palin: ‘Look Out for Stampede of Pink Elephants' | first=Jean | last=Spencer | date=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (referencing the elephant being the symbol of the Republican Party and pink being a stereotypical feminine color).

[[File:Adult ascaris worms being removed from the bile duct of a patient in South Africa.png|thumb|Adult ascaris worms being removed from the bile duct of a patient in South Africa]]
'''Soil-transmitted helminthiasis''' ('''STH''') is a type of [[helminth infection]] (helminthiasis) caused by different species of [[Nematode|roundworms]]. It is caused specifically by those worms which are transmitted through soil contaminated with faecal matter and are therefore called [[geohelminth|soil-transmitted helminths]]. Three types of soil-transmitted helminthiasis can be distinguished: [[ascariasis]], [[hookworm infection]] and [[trichuriasis|whipworm infection]]. These three types of infection are therefore caused by the large roundworm ''[[Ascaris lumbricoides|A. lumbricoides]], ''the hookworms'' [[Necator americanus]] ''or'' [[Ancylostoma duodenale]]'' and by the whipworm ''[[Trichuris trichiura]]''.

It has become the most common [[parasitic disease]] of humans worldwide. Approximately two billion people (about a third of global population) are infected as of the latest estimate, and four billion at risk, surpassing even the all-time most prevalent parasitic disease, [[malaria]].&lt;ref name="WHO2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Soil-transmitted helminth infections Fact sheet N°366|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs366/en/|website=who.int|accessdate=18 October 2014|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest numbers of cases occur in impoverished [[rural]] areas of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], [[Latin America]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[China]].&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite book|author =WHO|year= |title=Eliminating Soil-transmitted Helminthiasis as a Public Health Problem in Children: Progress Report 2001–2010 and Strategic Plan 2011–2020 |url= http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2012/9789241503129_eng.pdf |publisher= WHO Press, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland |pages=1–78 |isbn= 978-92-4-150312-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main cause, like for many types of [[helminthiasis|helminth infections]], is lack of [[sanitation]], such as the practice of [[open defecation]] and lack of [[hygiene]] such as hand washing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1001162|title = Effect of sanitation on soil-transmitted helminth infection: Systematic review and meta-analysis|last = Ziegelbauer|first = Kathrin|date = 2012|journal = PLOS Medicine|doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001162|pmid = 22291577|access-date =|pmc=3265535|volume=9|pages=e1001162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1001620|title = Water, Sanitation, Hygiene, and Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|last = Strunz|first = Eric C.|date = 2014|journal = PLOS Medicine|doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001620|pmid = |access-date =|volume=11|pages=e1001620}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded as one of the world's most important causes of intellectual and physical retardation.&lt;ref name="bet"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bethony J, Brooker S, Albonico M, Geiger SM, Loukas A, Diemert D, Hotez PJ |year=2006 |pmid=16679166 |title=Soil-transmitted helminth infections: ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm| url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(06)68653-4|journal=The Lancet|volume=367|issue=9521 |pages=1521–1532|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68653-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[helminthiasis|helminthic disease]] is so named because the infection is transmitted through [[ingestion]] of the [[nematode]] eggs in the soil, which is contaminated through [[faeces|excrements]]. Therefore, the disease is most prevalent in warm and moist climates where [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] are poor and waters are unsafe, including the [[temperate region|temperate zones]] during warmer months. STH is categorised among [[neglected tropical diseases]] because it inflicts tremendous disability and suffering, which can be clinically treated and relatively easily be prevented (primarily through improved [[sanitation]]), yet negligible attention has been given for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neglected Tropical Diseases|url=https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/ntd/diseases/index.html|website=cdc.gov|accessdate=28 November 2014|date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now among the target diseases of ''[[London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases]]'' (launched on 30 January 2012) to be controlled/eradicated by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = London Declaration (2012)|url= http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/NTD%20Event%20-%20London%20Declaration%20on%20NTDs.pdf |title=London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases|date= 30 January 2012|accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple prevention and control strategies are access to improved sanitation, public awareness on personal hygiene and health education.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Further|Helminthiasis#Signs and symptoms}}
Symptoms becomes evident only when the intensity of infection is relatively high. Thus the degree of negative outcomes is directly related to worm burden; more worms means greater severity of disease.

=== General ===
Most conditions of STH have a light worm burden and usually have no discernible symptoms. Heavy infections however cause a range of health problems, including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, blood and protein loss, [[rectal prolapse]], and [[stunted growth|physical]] and [[mental retardation]].

Severe ascariasis is typically a [[pneumonia]], as the larvae invades [[lung]]s, producing [[fever]], [[cough]] and [[dyspnoea]] during early stage of infection.

Hookworm infections insinuate a skin reaction ([[dermatitis]]), increased [[white blood cells]] ([[eosinophils]]), a pulmonary reaction ([[pneumonitis]]), and skin rash ([[urticarial]]).

[[Iron deficiency anaemia]] due to [[haemorrhage|blood loss]] is a common symptom.&lt;ref name="who2012"&gt;{{cite book |author= WHO |year=2012|title= Helminth Control in School-age Children: a Guide for Managers of Control Programmes| url= http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241548267_eng.pdf |edition=2 |publisher= WHO Press, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland |pages=1–75 |isbn= 978-92-4-154826-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malnutrition ===
STH is often associated with [[malnutrition in children]] as it worsens their nutritional status in multiple ways.&lt;ref name="WHO2014" /&gt; The worms can induce intestinal [[haemorrhage|bleeding]], competition for nutrients ([[malabsorption|malabsorption of nutrients]]), frequent [[anaemia]] and [[diarrhoea]].&lt;ref name="yap" /&gt; Soil-transmitted helminths can also cause loss of appetite.&lt;ref name="WHO2014" /&gt; These nutritional "knock on" effects of STH can have a significant impact on the mental and physical development of children. In [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] countries, communities remain suppressed due to malnourishment, cognitive disability and physical weaknesses as a result of heavy infections.

==Types==
Soil-transmitted helminths are essentially intestinal parasites and their eggs are liberated along the faeces of infected persons into the soil. ''Ascaris'' and hookworm eggs become infective as they develop into [[larva]]e in soil. Infection occurs when vegetables and fruits, contaminated with soil infested eggs, are consumed; or when hands or fingers have been contaminated with dirt carrying the eggs are put in the mouth. On the other hand, hookworm eggs are not directly infective. They hatch in soil, releasing mobile larvae that can penetrate the skin. Thus infection is acquired through accidental contact with contaminated soil.&lt;ref name=bet /&gt;

===Ascariasis===
{{Main|Ascariasis}}
[[Image:Ascaris lumbricoides.jpeg|thumb|Female ''Ascaris lumbricoides'']]
Ascariasis of STH is caused by the large roundworm ''[[Ascaris lumbricoides|A. lumbricoides]]''.  It is estimated to be the most widespread STH, affecting approximately 1 billion people. The victims constitute about half of the populations in [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] areas. Most conditions are mild and often show little or no [[symptom]]s. Heavy infections however are debilitating, causing severe intestinal blockage and impair growth in children. Children, compounded with [[malnutrition]], are most infected, with the most common age group being 3 to 8 year olds, with an annual death of about 20,000. Children are more susceptible due to their frequent exposure to contaminated environment such as during playing, eating raw vegetables and fruits, and drinking wastewater.&lt;ref name=bet /&gt;

=== Hookworm disease ===
{{Main|Ancylostomiasis}}
[[Image:hookworms.tif|thumb|left|Hookworm]]
Hookworm infection of STH is caused by ''[[Necator americanus|N. americanus]]'' and ''[[Ancylostoma duodenale|A. duodenale]]''. Mild infections produce [[diarrhoea]] and [[abdominal pain]]. More severe infections can create serious health problems for newborns, children, pregnant women, and [[malnutrition|malnourished]] adults. In fact it is the leading cause of [[anaemia]] and [[protein]] deficiency in [[developing nations]], affected an estimated 740 million people. ''N. americanus'' is the more common hookworm, while ''A. duodenale'' is more geographically restricted. Unlike other STHs, in which [[school-age]] children are most affected, high-intensity hookworm infections are more frequent in adults, specifically women. Roughly, 44 million pregnant women are estimated to be infected. The disease causes severe adverse effects in both the mother and infant, such as low birth weight, impaired [[milk]] production, and increased risk of [[mortality rate|mortality]].&lt;ref name=bet /&gt;

=== Trichuriasis ===
{{Main|Trichuriasis}}
[[Image:Trichuris trichiura egg.tif|thumb|''Trichuris trichiura'' egg]]
Whipworm (''[[Trichuris trichiura]]'') is the third most common STH-causing nematode in humans. According to current estimate, nearly 800 million people are infected, and majority of the victims are children. Heavy infections could lead to acute symptoms such as diarrhoea and anaemia, and chronic symptoms such as [[stunted growth|growth retardation]] and impaired [[cognitive development]]. Medical conditions are more often serious since [[coinfection]] with [[protozoan]] parasites such as ''[[Giardia]]'' and ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', and with other nematodes is common.&lt;ref name=bet /&gt; Predominantly a [[tropical disease]] of [[developing countries]], trichuriasis is quite common in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Starr MC, Montgomery SP |year=2011 |pmid=21976572|pmc=3183777 |title=Soil-transmitted helminthiasis in the United States: a systematic review--1940-2010| url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=21976572|journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg|volume=85|issue=4 |pages=680–684|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
For basic diagnosis, specific helminths can be generally identified from the [[faeces]], and their eggs microscopically examined and enumerated using [[eggs per gram|fecal egg count method]]. However, there are certain limitations such as the inability to identify [[coinfection|mixed infections]], and on clinical practice, the technique is inaccurate and unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Humphries D, Nguyen S, Boakye D, Wilson M, Cappello M |year=2012 |pmid=22903231 |title=The promise and pitfalls of mass drug administration to control intestinal helminth infections|url= https://zenodo.org/record/1119032|journal=Curr Opin Infect Dis|volume=25|issue=5 |pages=584–589|doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e328357e4cf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Krauth SJ, Coulibaly JT, Knopp S, Traoré M, N'Goran EK, Utzinger J |year=2012 |pmid=23285307|pmc=3527364 |title=An in-depth analysis of a piece of shit: distribution of ''Schistosoma mansoni'' and hookworm eggs in human stool|url= |journal=PLoS Negl Trop Dis|volume=6|issue=12 |pages=e1969|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001969}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A novel effective method for egg analysis is the [[Kato technique|Kato-Katz technique]]. It is a highly accurate and rapid method for ''A. lumbricoides'' and ''T. trichiura''; however not so much for hookworm, which could be due to fast degeneration of the rather delicate hookworm eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tarafder MR, Carabin H, Joseph L, ((Balolong E Jr)), Olveda R, McGarvey ST |year=2010 |pmid=19772859|pmc=2829363 |title=Estimating the sensitivity and specificity of Kato-Katz stool examination technique for detection of hookworms, ''Ascaris lumbricoides'' and ''Trichuris trichiura'' infections in humans in the absence of a 'gold standard'|url= |journal=PLoS Negl Trop Dis|volume=40|issue=4 |pages=399–404|doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2009.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
{{Further|Helminthiasis#Prevention}}
Prevention and control measures to prevent soil-transmitted helminthiasis are the following: availability of clean water for personal and domestic uses, improved access to [[sanitation]] which includes the use of properly functioning and clean [[toilets]] by all community members, education on personal [[hygiene]] such as hand washing and hygienic and safe food preparation; eliminating the use of untreated human faeces as [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;

==Treatment==
{{Further|Helminthiasis#Treatment}}
The World Health Organizations recommended [[albendazole]] or [[mebendazole]] for treatment.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;

===Mass treatment with drugs===
One strategy to control the disease in areas where it is common is the treatment of entire groups of people regardless of symptoms via [[mass drug administration]]. This is often done among school-age children and is known as [[mass deworming]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Mascarini-Serra L|year=2011 |pmc=3125032|pmid= 21731306|title= Prevention of soil-transmitted helminth infection | journal= Journal of Global Infectious Diseases | volume= 3 |issue=2 |pages= 175–182|url=http://www.jgid.org/article.asp?issn=0974-777X;year=2011;volume=3;issue=2;spage=175;epage=182;aulast=Mascarini%2DSerra| doi=10.4103/0974-777X.81696}}&lt;/ref&gt; While testing and treating children who are infected looks like it is effective, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that routine deworming, in the absence of a positive test, improves nutrition, [[haemoglobin]], school attendance or school performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Taylor-Robinson DC, Maayan N, Soares-Weiser K, Donegan S, Garner P |title=Deworming drugs for soil-transmitted intestinal worms in children: effects on nutritional indicators, haemoglobin and school performance |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= 7|issue=7 |pages=CD000371 |year=2012 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000371.pub4 |pmid=22786473|pmc=4523932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23152203|date = July 2018}}

For this purpose, broad-spectrum [[benzimidazole]]s such as [[mebendazole]] and [[albendazole]] are the drugs of choice recommended by [[WHO]]. These [[anthelminthics]] are administered in a single dose are safe, relatively inexpensive, and effective for several months. Mebendazole can be given with a single dose twice a day for three consecutive days. Albendazole is given at a single dose. WHO recommends annual treatment in areas where between 20 and 50% of people are infected, and a twice a year treatment if it is over 50%; and in low risk situation (i.e. less than 20% prevalence) case-by-case treatment.&lt;ref name=who2012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= WHO |year=2006|title= Preventive Chemotherapy in Human Helminthiasis : Coordinated Use of Anthelminthic Drugs in Control Interventions : a Manual for Health Professionals and Programme Managers| url= http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2006/9241547103_eng.pdf |edition= |publisher= WHO Press, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland |pages=1–61 |isbn= 9241547103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these, [[pyrantel pamoate]] is also equally effective on ascaris. However, it has been reported that albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate are not entirely effective against ''T. trichiura'' with single oral doses in population-based control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Keiser J, Utzinger J |year=2008 |pmc= |pmid= 18430913|title= Efficacy of current drugs against soil-transmitted helminth infections: systematic review and meta-analysis|journal= JAMA| volume= 299 |issue=16 |pages= 1937–1948|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.299.16.1937 | doi=10.1001/jama.299.16.1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs for those with other diseases===
In cases of coinfection, combination therapy with [[ivermectin]] and [[diethylcarbamazine]] is advocated.

==Epidemiology==

=== Regions ===
Infections are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas, with the greatest numbers occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, China and east Asia.&lt;ref name="WHO2014" /&gt;

=== Infection estimates ===
The World Health Organization estimates that globally more than 1.5 billion people (24% of the total population) have a soil-transmitted helminth infection.&lt;ref name="WHO2014" /&gt; Over 270 million preschool-age children and over 600 million school-age children live in areas where these parasites are intensively transmitted, and are in need of treatment and preventive interventions. Latest estimates indicate that more than 880 million children are in need of treatment from STH infections.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yap" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By type of parasitic worm the breakdown is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hotez PJ, Fenwick A, Savioli L, Molyneux DH |year=2009 |pmid=19410718 |pmc= |title= Rescuing the bottom billion through control of neglected tropical diseases | url= |journal=The Lancet |volume=373|issue=9674 |pages= 1570–1575 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60233-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*approximately 807-1,121 million with [[ascaris]]
*approximately 576-740 million with [[hookworm]]
*approximately 604-795 million with [[whipworm]]

=== Deaths ===
Latest estimates indicate that the total annual death toll which is directly attributable is as high as 135,000.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yap"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Yap P, Fürst T, Müller I, Kriemler S, Utzinger J, Steinmann P |year=2012 |pmc= 3486755|pmid= 22951972|title= Determining soil-transmitted helminth infection status and physical fitness of school-aged children|journal= Journal of Visualized Experiments| volume= 66 |issue= |pages= e3966| doi=10.3791/3966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLoS Negl Trop Dis |year=2012|volume=6|issue=4|pages=e1582|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001582|title=A research agenda for helminth diseases of humans: the problem of helminthiases|vauthors=Lustigman S, Prichard RK, Gazzinelli A, Grant WN, Boatin BA, McCarthy JS, Basáñez MG |pmid=22545164 |pmc=3335854 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The death toll due to the malnutrition link is likely to be much higher.

'''Steven James Bartlett''' (born 1945) is an American [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]] notable for his studies in [[epistemology]] and the [[self-reference|theory of reflexivity]], and for his work on the [[psychology]] of [[human aggression]] and destructiveness, and the shortcomings of [[normality (behavior)|psychological normality]]. His findings challenge the assumption that psychological normality should serve as a standard for good mental health. He is the author or editor of more than 20 books and research monographs as well as many papers published in professional journals in the fields of [[epistemology]], [[psychology]], [[mathematical logic]], and [[philosophy of science]].

==Biography==
Bartlett was born in [[Mexico City]]. He is the son of American author and artist [[Paul Alexander Bartlett]] and his wife, American poet [[Elizabeth Bartlett (American poet)|Elizabeth Bartlett]]. Steven James Bartlett received his B.A. in 1965 from Raymond College, an Oxford-style honors college of the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]], his M.A. in [[philosophy]] in 1968 from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], his Ph.D. in philosophy in 1971 from the [[Université de Paris]], and later engaged in postdoctoral study in [[clinical psychology]] at [[Saint Louis University]], 1975–77, and [[Washington University|Washington University in St. Louis]], 1983-84.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Authors SB"&gt;Biographical and other information from "Steven James Bartlett" entry in ''Contemporary Authors Online''.

==Awards and honors==
Bartlett has received awards and honors for his work throughout his life, beginning at an early age: Award winner in local [[San Jose, California]] and regional [[San Francisco Bay Area]] Science Fairs for his research in microbiology, "Search for New Antibiotics," 1961; selected only student to appear on television's [[Science in Action (TV series)|"Science in Action"]] with Nobel Laureate [[Melvin Calvin]], [[San Francisco]], California, 1961; awarded best student in chemistry in the school, [[Saratoga High School (California)]], 1961; National Science Foundation summer institute fellowship award, [[Santa Clara University]], 1961; Santa Clara University scholarship award to attend university concomitantly while still in high school, 1961–62; award winner in local San Jose and regional Bay Area Science Fairs for reflector telescope and clock drive original design and construction, 1962; awarded four-year Presidential scholarship by Santa Clara University (tenure 1962-64, honors student, physics major); awarded Boyce Scholarship at Raymond College, University of the Pacific, 1964–65; Alliance Française Grunsfeld Fellow, Université de Paris, 1966–67; California State graduate fellow, University of California, Santa Barbara, 1967–68; Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, Santa Barbara, California, fellowship in philosophy and mathematics, 1969–70; Raymond College, honored alumnus, High Table address, 1969; Université de Paris, Ph.D. with commendation from the jury, 1971; Max-Planck-Gesellschaft postdoctoral research fellowship, Max-Planck-Institut, Starnberg, Germany, 1974–75; [[Lilly Endowment]] and Saint Louis University Project C.O.V.E.

==Principal areas of research==
As described in further detail in the sections that follow, Bartlett's research and publications can be divided into two main groups: studies in philosophy and studies in clinical psychology. In philosophy, his research has focused on the theory of [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]], [[self-reference|self-referential argumentation]], and the [[metatheory]] of [[theory of reference|reference]] and [[identification (psychology)|identification]]. In clinical psychology, his research has focused on human [[pathology]] as it is expressed in [[genocide]], the [[Holocaust]], [[war]], [[terrorism]], [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]], [[hatred]], human ecological destruction, and human conceptual pathology. In addition, Bartlett's research in clinical psychology has sought to develop our understanding of what he calls human ''moral intelligence'', as well as of the psychology of [[peer review]] and editorial bias, the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of hatred, the psychology of mediocrity, and the psychology of [[stupidity]]. He has challenged the conventional understanding and treatment of [[mental disorder]]s as promoted by the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''. Bartlett's publishing record and biographical information&lt;ref name="Contemporary Authors SB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PoM Bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Normality Bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conceptual Autobiography" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Species Bio" /&gt; show that his work developed during the following approximate periods:
* 1964-1974, studies in phenomenology
* 1975-1988, studies relating to the [[metalogic]] of reference
* 1989-2011, studies relating to clinical psychology
* 2012-  , further work relating to the metalogic of reference

===Research and publications in philosophy===

====Phenomenology and the elimination of conceptual error====
Beginning with Bartlett's doctoral dissertation,&lt;ref name="Dissertation" /&gt; whose doctoral jury members were French philosopher [[Paul Ricoeur]] (dissertation director), Belgian mathematical logician [[Jean Ladrière]], and Belgian philosopher Alphonse de Waehlens, Bartlett developed an approach to the study of philosophical problems by means of a ''therapy for concepts''. The approach took the form of a self-validating phenomenological epistemology whose purpose is the identification and correction of many conceptually self-undermining errors that Bartlett classified as ''conceptual pathologies''. He applied the resulting methodology to a number of traditionally understood epistemological problems, as well as to portions of everyday, conventional conceptual vocabulary, to show that many of these must be recognized to be self-referentially inconsistent. He characterized the resulting methodology as ''self-validating'' in the sense that it cannot ''not'' be accepted without self-referential inconsistency.

====Studies of the metalogic of reference and conceptual therapy====
Bartlett first formulated his revisionary methodology within a phenomenological framework in which the concept of reference plays a logically primitive role; he later separated his approach to ''conceptual therapy'' from phenomenology. This took the form of a theoretically neutral ''metalogic of reference''.&lt;ref name="MoR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conceptual Therapy book"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, ''Conceptual Therapy: An Introduction to Framework-relative Epistemology.''

''Argumentation,'' Vol. 1, No. 2, 1988, pp. 69-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Bartlett applied the resulting methodology to a group of conceptually basic concepts (for example, space, time, causality, consciousness, etc.) that both are relied upon in much ordinary thinking and are used in the formulation of scientific theories. Such applications, Bartlett sought to show, bring to light that many basic concepts, which tend to be routinely employed unquestioningly, are self-referentially inconsistent and stand in need of meaningful substitutes, for which he developed self-referentially consistent replacement concepts.&lt;ref name="Dissertation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conceptual Therapy book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reflexivity Book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S-R Phen and PhilSc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref Consistency" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phil as Conceptual Therapy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoisted" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PoM"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, ''The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil''.

Gita Y. Arani-May (Trans.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Studies of reflexivity====
Bartlett has contributed to the field of study ''the general theory of reflexivity,'' which investigates the properties of systems capable of [[self-reference]].&lt;ref name="MoR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conceptual Therapy book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Self-Ref Anthology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reflexivity Book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S-R Phen and PhilSc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref Consistency" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoisted" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Idea of MoR" /&gt; As Bartlett has described, there are many such systems, ranging from reflexive formal systems in [[mathematics]] and in [[mathematical logic]], to self-referential systems in [[artificial intelligence]] and the [[theory of computation]], to self-referential systems that are physiologically based — an advanced example being that of human self-awareness and the capacity to reflect on that awareness. Secondary applications arise in connection with breakdowns in reflexive functioning found in certain [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]].&lt;ref name="PoM" /&gt;

===Research and publications in clinical psychology===
Bartlett's studies relating to clinical psychology have focused on the following areas:

====The psychology of human aggression and destructiveness====
In 2005, Bartlett's book ''The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil'' was published.&lt;ref name="PoM" /&gt; The 200,000-word study applies the science of pathology to the human species in order to identify and describe many dispositionally-based pathologies that afflict our species, often without our awareness. A central purpose of the book is to bring together and discuss the work of twentieth century psychologists, psychiatrists, ethologists, psychologically-focused historians, and others who have studied the underlying psychology of human aggression and destructiveness. The conclusions of the study emphasize that human pathology has many originating factors, that people obtain varied cognitive and emotional gratifications from such pathology, and that human pathology is a normal human condition and is therefore generally intractable, at least at this stage of human development.&lt;ref name="PoM" /&gt; Bartlett describes how deficits in what he defines as ''moral intelligence'' combine with the psychology of stupidity, which together form major contributors to the psychological shortcomings that result in human pathology.&lt;ref name="moral intelligence"&gt;Bartlett first directed attention to what he calls human "moral intelligence" in his 2002 work, "Roots of Human Resistance to Animal Rights: Psychological and Conceptual Blocks." ''Animal Law'', Vol. 8, 2002, pp. 143-76. He then studied the nature of moral intelligence in detail in his 2005 book, ''The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil.'' Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas, 2005, Chapter 18; also pp. 5, 8, 64, 101, 174, 184, 218, 293, 304, 310-312. In Bartlett's study, deficits in moral intelligence constitute one of the central factors that contribute to human pathology&lt;/ref&gt; In critical responses to the book, the study was commended by ''The Journal of Analytical Psychology'': "Bartlett is a lucid, painstaking and illuminating writer. This is certainly a classic work of reference in the field."&lt;ref name="Journal of Analytical Psychology"&gt;Marcus West, "Steven James Bartlett: ''The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil'' – Book Review." ''The Journal of Analytical Psychology,'' Volume 51, No. 3, June, 2006, pp. 486-487.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic'' appraised the book as "a challenging and thought provoking approach that makes a significant contribution to an aspect of human psychopathology that is rarely or so comprehensively addressed."&lt;ref name="MenningerClinic"&gt;W. W. Meissner, M.D., "''The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil'' by Steven James Bartlett: Book Review." ''The Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic'', Vol. 71, No. 3, 2007, pp. 267-268.&lt;/ref&gt; About the book, [[M. Scott Peck]] commented: "[T]he study of evil is just beginning and you are a pioneer."&lt;ref name="PoM Cover" /&gt; Eric Zillmer, Carl R. Pacifico Professor of Neuropsychology at [[Drexel University]], commended the book: "Steven James Bartlett's ''The Pathology of Man'' marks the most comprehensive examination of evil to date. Drawing from different fields of study, including psychology and epistemology, Bartlett sets out on a ''Tour de Force'' of delineating the parameters on human evil.... The resulting text is a most welcome addition to the field and provides for fascinating reading. ''The Pathology of Man'' is a timely, scholarly, and important piece of work that should appeal to anyone who is interested in understanding human evil."&lt;ref name="PoM Preface"&gt;"Preface" to Steven James Bartlett, ''The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil.'' Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas, 2005, pp. vii-viii.&lt;/ref&gt; Author and President of the Jewish Life Network [[Irving Greenberg]] commented: "This book is stunning, upsetting, gripping.... [T]he book is a moral act of the highest order. These...comments would be incomplete without mentioning the erudition, the intellectual insight and playfulness, the gallows humor and the self-restraint which deepen and lighten this book."&lt;ref name="PoM Preface" /&gt; Since the publication of ''The Pathology of Man,'' Bartlett has published a series of further books and papers related to the same and related subjects.&lt;ref name="Normality"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, ''Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health.''

Plante (Ed.), ''Abnormal Psychology across the Ages''. Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger, 2013, Vol. 3, Chapter 1, pp. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Challenging the standard of psychological normality presupposed by contemporary psychiatry and much clinical psychology====
In 2011, Bartlett's book ''Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health'' was published.&lt;ref name="Normality" /&gt; The book examines contemporary psychiatry's and clinical psychology's definition of mental health in terms of the baseline standard of psychological normality. Bartlett makes the case that this supposition has come to be accepted uncritically — even though that supposition is fundamental to current clinical theory and practice, and forms the core of the psychiatric classification system of the ''DSM'' (the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''), which has become today’s diagnostic authority. ''Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health'' questions and rejects this central assumption. Among the author's objections to this assumption is the reification by the ''DSM'' of [[syndrome]]s (i.e., equating mere syndromes with real disease entities) despite the absence of an organic basis for the majority of alleged medical disorders.&lt;ref name="Normality" /&gt; Bartlett seeks to offer a constructive revision of what we should accept as a standard for good mental health.&lt;ref name="Normality" /&gt; A critical assessment by ''PsychCRITIQUES'' combined a review of both ''The Pathology of Man'' and ''Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health'', evaluating the two books as follows: "''Pathology'' and ''Normality'' contain many altogether usefully reframed concepts. [T]he [[semiotics|semiotic]] analysis of [[nosology|nosologies]] offered in Chapter 2 of ''Normality'' [is] a most promising organizing conceptual framework, helpful in understanding the problems with ''DSM'' classifications. It could not be more relevant in our times.... I wish everyone would read Bartlett’s chapter in ''Normality'' on the abuses of peer review and editorial bias (Chapter 7) and adopt his proposed code of conduct for peer reviewers and editors (p. 172). And Bartlett’s treatment of [[relativism]], the relativity of frameworks, and human evil in ''Pathology'' is absolutely limpid (Chapter 20). These and many other gems are scattered throughout the books. For this reason, and because the books present such an unusual stance that can provoke thoughtful consideration of the accepted truths in psychology, I highly recommend them.... Both books are well written and clearly structured. Bartlett follows a regular expository pattern by explaining objectives, logically and systematically developing arguments and conclusions, and presenting frequent summaries. The premises and implications are intellectually easy to grasp, unforgettable, and alarming.... Bartlett includes considerations and concepts that are seldom presented elsewhere."&lt;ref name=PsychCRITIQUES&gt;Alejandra Suarez, "The Worst Devils of Our Nature: A Review of ''Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health'' and ''The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil.''" ''PsychCRITIQUES,'' June 13, 2012, Vol. 57, Release 23, Article 2 (no pagination specified).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychotherapy and its effectiveness====
Over a period of decades, Bartlett has weighed the question whether psychotherapy is truly effective. In 1987, his book ''When You Don’t Know Where to Turn: A Self-Diagnosing Guide to Counseling and Therapy'' was published and subsequently adopted by the [[Psychology Today]] Book Club and the Psychotherapy Book Club.&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, ''When You Don’t Know Where to Turn: A Self-Diagnosing Guide to Counseling and Therapy.'' New York: Contemporary Books/McGraw-Hill, 1987. Now freely available with a 2014 Preface as an [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44926 eBook through Project Gutenberg]; [http://www.willamette.edu/~sbartlet/when_you_don't_know_where_to_turn.html separate online description of the book and its purpose.]&lt;/ref&gt; The book presents a self-diagnosing algorithm to help readers identify, based on effectiveness studies, potentially most promising forms of therapeutic care. The algorithm takes into account individual symptoms, circumstances, personality, and life goals.&lt;ref name="Guide" /&gt; The book was followed by the publication of the author's summary appraisal of the effectiveness of psychotherapy,&lt;ref name="Effectiveness"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, "The Problem of Psychotherapeutic Effectiveness." ''Methodology and Science,'' Vol. 23, No. 2, 1990, pp. 75-86.&lt;/ref&gt; about which psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]], a long-time critic of psychiatry, commented: "It is one of the best, if not the best, that I have read on this subject."&lt;ref name="Szasz" /&gt; Similarly, psychologist [[Hans H. Strupp]], who has extensively studied the effectiveness of psychotherapy, commented: "I find myself in substantial agreement with [Bartlett's] major points which are well stated."&lt;ref name="Strupp"&gt;Hans H. Strupp, quotation from letter to the author dated November 14, 1990, [http://www.willamette.edu/~sbartlet/effectiveness_of_psychotherapy.html published online] and in the open access paper, [https://philpapers.org/go.pl?id=JAMTPO-37&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fphilpapers.org%2Farchive%2FJAMTPO-37.pdf Steven James Bartlett, "The Problem of Psychotherapeutic Effectiveness," updated 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Further discussion"&gt;A further discussion of these issues is found in Bartlett's book, ''Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health,'' Chap. 9, pp. 237-240. Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger Publishers, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The psychology of higher education and burn-out among liberal arts faculty====
Bartlett studied these issues in a series of published papers that seek to explain faculty demoralization that can result from deteriorating conditions affecting the state of higher education in America.&lt;ref name="Acedia"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, "''Acedia'': The Etiology of Work-Engendered Depression." ''New Ideas in Psychology,'' Vol. 8, No. 3, 1990, pp. 389-396.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbarians"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, "Barbarians at the Door: A Psychological and Historical Profile of Today’s College Students." ''Methodology and Science,'' Vol. 26, No. 1, 1993, pp. 18-40. (A concurrent publication in the Netherlands of the following article:) Steven James Bartlett, "Barbarians at the Door: A Psychological and Historical Profile of Today’s College Students." ''Modern Age,'' Vol. 35, No. 4, Summer, 1993, pp. 296-310. (In a "Note to Our Readers," Vol. 36, No. 3, page 303, the journal notified readers of this version of the paper that ''Modern Age'' expressed regret for "numerous and substantive changes and abridgments...to which the author had not consented," and offered to send readers upon request a reprint of the text as originally written.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loss"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, "The Loss of Permanent Realities: Demoralization of University Faculty in the Liberal Arts." ''Methodology and Science,'' Vol. 27, No. 1, 1994, pp. 25-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Faculty Demoralization"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, "The Psychology of Faculty Demoralization in the Liberal Arts: Burnout, ''Acedia,'' and the Disintegration of Idealism." ''New Ideas in Psychology,'' Vol. 12, No. 3, 1994, pp. 277-289.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The psychology of animal rights====
Bartlett published a psychological and epistemological analysis of the blocks that prevent the majority of people from recognizing and respecting the sentience of members of other species. The study, "Roots of Human Resistance to Animal Rights: Psychological and Conceptual Blocks," was developed within a legal framework in order to make evident the ways in which human laws have reflected the underlying psychological and conceptual blocks to compassionate treatment of non-human animals.&lt;ref name="Roots-English"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, "Roots of Human Resistance to Animal Rights: Psychological and Conceptual Blocks." ''Animal Law'', Vol. 8, 2002, pp. 143-76. Electronically re-published October, 2002, by the [http://www.animallaw.info/articles/arussbartlett2002.htm Michigan State University's Detroit College of Law, Animal Law Web Center.]&lt;/ref&gt; This work was subsequently translated into German and published online.&lt;ref name="Roots-German"&gt;[http://www.simorgh.de/animallaw/bartlett_33-67.pdf Steven James Bartlett, "Wurzeln menschlichen Widerstands gegen Tierrechte: Psychologische und konceptuelle Blockaden." Gita Y. Arani-May (Trans.).]&lt;/ref&gt; Bartlett was later invited by Brazil's Ministry of Education to address the International Congress on Animal Rights, Salvador, Brazil, Oct. 8-11, 2008. For use at the Congress, "Roots of Human Resistance to Animal Rights" was translated into Portuguese and then published.&lt;ref name="Roots-Portuguese"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, "Raízes da resistência humana aos direitos dos animais: Bloqueios psicológicos e conceituais." Daniel Braga Lourenço (Trans.). ''Brazilian Animal Rights Review'' (''Revista Brasileira de Direito Animal''), Vol. 2, No. 3, July/December, 2007, pp. 17-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The psychology of creativity====
Bartlett's studies relating to the nosology of mental illness and his critique of the assumption that psychological normality should be equated with good mental health led him to examine the psychology of creative individuals.&lt;ref name="Normality" /&gt; The psychology of artists and other highly creative people has been studied from the diagnostic perspective of ''DSM's'' psychiatric classification of mental disorders, with the result that some outstanding creative individuals may be considered to have various degrees of psychopathology.&lt;ref name="Normality" /&gt; Bartlett has argued that this is not only short-sighted, but it questionably presumes that the psychology of normality should serve as arbiter for mentally healthy emotional, aesthetic, and cognitive characteristics and abilities.&lt;ref name="Normality" /&gt; In a group of further publications, Bartlett has described in detail how it is possible to enrich and deepen our understanding of both the psychology of creativity and the psychology of normality.&lt;ref name="Normality" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Artist's Perspective" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dilemma" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmful"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, "When Normal Is Harmful, and Abnormal Is Healthy." In the electronic research database, ''Health and Wellness.'' Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-Clio Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychological studies of philosophy====
With training and research in psychology and philosophy, Bartlett has undertaken a psychological examination both of philosophy as a discipline and of philosophers as a psychologically characterizable group.&lt;ref name="Narcissism and Philosophy"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, "Narcissism and Philosophy." ''Methodology and Science,'' Vol. 19, No. 1, 1986, pp. 16-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Philosophy as Ideology"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, "Philosophy as Ideology." ''Metaphilosophy,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1986, pp. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Psych Underpinnings"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, "Psychological Underpinnings of Philosophy." ''Metaphilosophy,'' Vol. 20, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, 1989, pp. 295-305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Epistemological Intelligence"&gt;Steven James Bartlett, "Epistemological Intelligence." Monograph, open access publication, 2017, [https://philpapers.org/rec/BAREI-4 PhilPapers] and [https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01429159 HAL (Centre pour la Communication Scientifique Directe).]&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this work, Bartlett has sought to identify and describe "epistemological intelligence" as a distinguishable variety of human intelligence, one which he explains is especially important to philosophers. In this context, he has sought to understand the challenges posed by the psychological profile of philosophers that can obstruct the development and implementation of the skills associated with epistemological intelligence.&lt;ref name="Epistemological Intelligence" /&gt;

In this paper, Bartlett formulates what he calls a "''self-validating''" criterion of meaning. By this he means a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition of meaning that is logically compelling in the sense that this criterion of meaning cannot ''not'' be accepted without bringing about a form of self-referential consistency that undermines the very possibility of meaning. Bartlett argues that this "metalogical" variety of self-referential inconsistency comprises a new and distinct kind of self-referential inconsistency, to be distinguished from the philosophically familiar varieties of semantical and pragmatical self-referential inconsistency.

In Bartlett's monograph, the "species problem" refers to past efforts, foremost by biologists, to define definitively and objectively what the concept of "species" means. Bartlett seeks to demonstrate two central assertions about the species problem: First, he claims that past efforts to define in any compelling way what "species" means have been unsuccessful because they have failed to understand the theoretical impossibility of the task. It is theoretically impossible, he argues, to define in any compelling way what "species" means due to what he calls "the inescapable ambiguity" that is ingredient in the very attempt to reach such a definition. Second, he claims that the solution to the species problem requires what he calls a "framework-relative" approach to species definition. Such an approach, Bartlett seeks to demonstrate, is logically compelling in the sense that it cannot ''not'' be accepted without inconsistency.

* [http://philpapers.org/rec/BARPAP-20 "Paratheism: A Proof That God Neither Exists nor Does Not Exist"]. Bartlett argues that theism, atheism, and agnosticism are all fundamentally incoherent from the standpoint of a logical, epistemological analysis. He formulates a proof that theism, as well as atheism and agnosticism, are equally unacceptable because each is "conceptually self-undermining" and therefore incoherent.
* ''Epistemological Intelligence''. Open access monograph available from [https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01429159 HAL (Centre pour la Communication Scientifique Directe)] and [https://philpapers.org/rec/BAREI-4 PhilPapers]. In this monograph, Bartlett develops the concept of "''epistemological intelligence''," which he introduces as a new distinguishable variety of human intelligence. He reports his observations of the psychology of philosophers, and claims that the commonly prevailing psychological profile of philosophers often stands in the way of their ability to develop the skills that define epistemological intelligence.
* [https://philpapers.org/rec/BARMOL-2 "Mismeasuring Our Lives: The Case against Usefulness, Popularity, and the Desire to Influence Others"]. In this paper, Bartlett examines what he claims are three important and unquestioned presumptions that fundamentally influence contemporary society, our educational system, and the professions. These presumptions are: the high value that is placed on usefulness, on striving for popularity, and on the wish to influence other people. He presents the case against these presumptions which he claims impede the development of human culture.
* [http://cogprints.org/10282/ "The Objectivity of Truth, Morality, and Beauty"]. In this essay, Bartlett advances an innovative approach to answer the perennial question whether truth, morality, and beauty have an objective basis. The essay seeks to show how it is possible to associate three varieties of human intelligence -- cognitive intelligence, "''moral intelligence''," and "''aesthetic intelligence''" -- with justifiable objective judgments about truth, morality, and beauty.
* [https://philpapers.org/rec/BARAUD-4 "America's Upside-down Doctrine of Education: Albert Jay Nock's Theory of What Has Gone Wrong — Or Is It Right?"]. In this paper, Bartlett examines a set of fundamental assumptions about American education that were analyzed and criticized almost a hundred years ago by [[Albert Jay Nock]], an author and theorist of education. Nock's theory of American education points to a need to question these assumptions and, if possible, to support them with evidence.

|[[Ancient times]]||In ancient cultures, religion and medicine are linked. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian temple|temples]] are the earliest documented institutions aiming to provide healthcare. In [[ancient Greece]], temples dedicated to the healer-god [[Asclepius]], known as ''Asclepieia'', function as centers of medical advice, prognosis, and healing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guenter B. Risse|Risse, G.B.]] ''Mending bodies, saving souls: a history of hospitals.''

|-
|[[Middle Ages]]||From the 6th to the 10th century, in Europe, the [[infirmary]] becomes an established part of every monastery under the influence of the [[Benedictine Order]]. Beyond the 10th century, monastic infirmaries continue to expand, and public hospitals are also opened. City authorities, the church and private sources finance these facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cilliers|first1=L|last2=Retief|first2=FP.|title=The evolution of the hospital from antiquity to the end of the middle ages.|pmid=14509111|volume=25|journal=Curationis|pages=60–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary function of medieval hospitals is to worship to God. Most hospitals contain one chapel, at least one clergyman, and inmates that are expected to help with prayer.&lt;ref name="English Hospital"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orme|first1=Nicholas|last2=Webster|first2=Margaret|title=The English Hospital|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-06058-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bowers&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowers|first1=Barbara S.|title=The Medieval Hospital and Medical Practice|date=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|isbn=978-0-7546-5110-9|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Islamic Golden Age]]||Many hospitals were developed during the early Islamic era. The idea of the hospital as a place for the care of sick people is taken from the early [[Caliph]]s.&lt;ref name="Nagamia"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nagamia |first=Hussain |title=Islamic Medicine History and Current Practice |journal=Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine |date=October 2003 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=19–30 |url=http://www.ishim.net/ishimj/not%20used/not%20used/JISHIM%20VOL.2%20NO.4%20PDF.pdf#page=24 |accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to contemporaneous Christian institutions, which were poor and sick relief facilities offered by some monasteries, the [[Bimaristan|Islamic hospital]] was a more elaborate institution with a wider range of functions. Islamic hospitals tended to be large, urban structures, and were largely secular institutions, many open to all. The Islamic hospital served several purposes, as a center of medical treatment, a home for patients recovering from illness or accidents, an insane asylum, and a retirement home with basic maintenance needs for the aged and infirm.&lt;ref name="nlm"&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_12.html Islamic Culture and the Medical Arts: Hospitals], [[United States National Library of Medicine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|19th century||Hospitals and the medical profession become more professionalized, with a reorganization of hospital management along more bureaucratic and administrative lines. By the end of the century, the modern hospital begins to take shape with a proliferation of a variety of public and private hospital systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | pages=316–17 | last=Porter |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Porter | title=The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present | publisher=W.

'''Uncle Tom syndrome''' is a concept in [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Yo |author2=Yolanda Kaye Jackson  |title=Encyclopedia of multicultural psychology |publisher=SAGE Publications |year=2006 |pages=509 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_hcurFqnQioC |isbn=1-4129-0948-1}}, overviews of terms available [http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/11748_Jackson_Reader's_Guide.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a [[coping skill]] where individuals use passivity and [[submissiveness]] when confronted with a threat, leading to subservient behaviour and [[appeasement]], while concealing their true thoughts and feelings. The term "[[Uncle Tom]]" comes from the title character of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', where the [[African American]] slave Tom is beaten to death by a cruel white master for refusing to betray the whereabouts of two other slaves.

In the American racial context, "Uncle Tom" is a [[pejorative]] term for blacks that give up or hide their ethnic or gender outlooks, traits, and practices, in order to be accepted into the mainstream. In African-American parlance this is also derogatorily known as an [[Oreo|Oreo cookie]]: black on the outside, and white on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Seymour Michael |author2=Anthony J. Savoie  |title=Respect and rights: class, race, and gender today |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-fTicTroHkC |page =134|isbn=0-7425-1729-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In race minority literature Uncle Tom syndrome refers to blacks that, as a necessary survival technique, opt to appear docile, non-assertive, and happy-go-lucky. Especially during slavery, blacks used passivity and servility for the avoidance of retaliation and for self-preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sue |first=Derald Wing |author2=Monica McGoldrick  |title=Multicultural social work practice |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2005 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-sXw3nbYk58C |page=54 |isbn=0-471-66252-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Aboriginal Australian [[Wurundjeri]] of [[Coranderrk]] are reported to have conformed to European ways while at the same time retaining group dignity and individual self-respect, avoiding the syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mulvaney |first=Derek John |title=Encounters in place: outsiders and aboriginal Australians, 1606-1985 |publisher=University of Queensland Press |year=1989 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLC0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1 |page=134|isbn=0-7022-2153-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a broader context, the term may refer to a minority's strategy of coping with oppression from socially, culturally or economically dominant groups involving suppression of aggressive feelings and even identification with the oppressor, leading to "forced assimilation/acculturation" of the cultural minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mio |first=Jeffrey Scott |title=Key words in multicultural interventions |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQnUTLMeds0C |page=204|isbn=0-313-29547-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7405">'''Vulvitis''' is inflammation of the [[vulva]], the external female mammalian genitalia that include the [[labia majora]], [[labia minora]], [[clitoris]], and [[introitus]] (the entrance to the vagina). It may co-occur as [[vulvovaginitis]] with [[vaginitis]], inflammation of the vagina, and may have infectious or non-infectious causes. The warm and moist conditions of the [[vulva]] make it easily affected. Vulvitis is prone to occur in any female especially those who have certain sensitivities, infections, allergies, or diseases that make them likely to have vulvitis. Postmenopausal women and prepubescent girls are more prone to be affected by it, as compared to women in their [[menstruation]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.firstderm.com/vulvitis/|title=Online Dermatology - Vulvitis|date=2016-01-02|work=First Derm|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is so because they have low [[estrogen]] levels which makes their vulvar tissue thin and dry. Women having [[Diabetes insipidus|diabetes]] are also prone to be affected by vulvitis due to the high sugar content in their cells, increasing their vulnerability. Vulvitis is not a disease , it is just an inflammation caused by an infection, allergy or injury. Vulvitis may also be symptom of any sexually transmitted disease or a fungal infection.{{mcn|date=December 2018}}

== Causes ==
Vulvitis may be caused by the following reasons:

# Allergies or sensitivities towards certain products like - coloured or perfumed toilet papers, vaginal sprays or douches, shampoos and hair conditioners, laundry [[Detergent|detergents]], creams or medications.
# Reactions to - bubble bath or soaps used on genital area, [[Spermicide|spermicides]], [[Sanitary napkin|sanitary napkins.]]
# Irritations caused by - a yeast infection, chlorinated water in swimming pools or hot tubs, synthetic underwear or nylon pantyhose without a breathable cotton crotch, wearing a wet bathing suit for a long time, bike or horseback riding, douching, poor personal hygiene, incontinence, by urine or stool if it remains in contact with the vulva (as may occur in women who have incontinence or are confined to bed), contact with urine and stool sometimes cause ongoing (chronic) vulvitis.
# Infections such as - [[vaginitis]], [[genital herpes]], viral and fungal infection.
# Factors such as - Diabetes, [[scabies]] or pubic lice, eczema or [[dermatitis]], [[oral sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/book-excerpts/health-article/vulvitis/|title=Vulvitis - Our Bodies Ourselves|work=Our Bodies Ourselves|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms ==
The symptoms of Vulvitis are:

# Extreme and constant itching
# A burning sensation in the vulvar area
# [[Vaginal discharge]]
# Small cracks on the skin of the vulva
# Redness and swelling on the vulva and [[labia]] (lips of the vagina)
# clear fluid-filled Blisters on the vulva
# Scaly, thick, whitish patches on the vulva
# Bumps or warts
# Soreness
# Pain with sex
# Increased sensitivity when wiping with toilet paper

Symptoms of vulvitis may also be an indication of other diseases or disorders. A doctor should be consulted when one is having any of these symptoms. The symptoms may vary on depending on the cause and the time period it has been infected for.{{mcn|date=December 2018}}

== Diagnosis ==
Vulvitis can have many different causes which makes the diagnosis difficult. The diagnosis of vulvitis starts with examining the medical history and pelvic examination of the person affected by it. Other diagnostic tools like pap smears, urine tests, blood tests and tests for sexually transmitted diseases are also done. {{mcn|date=December 2018}}

== In children  ==
Vulvitis, inflammation of the vulva, can have a variety of etiologies in children and adolescents, including [[allergic dermatitis]], [[contact dermatitis]], [[lichen sclerosus]], and infections with bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Dermatitis in infants is commonly caused by a soiled diaper being left on for an extended period of time. Increasing the frequency of diaper changes and topical application of [[Moisturizer|emollients]] are sufficient to resolve most cases. Dermatitis of the vulva in older children is usually caused by exposure to an irritant (e.g. scented products that come into contact with the vulva, laundry detergent, soaps, etc.) and is treated with preventing exposure and encouraging [[Sitz bath|sitz baths]] with [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] as the vulvar skin heals. Other treatment options for vulvar dermatitis include oral [[Hydroxyzine|hydroxyzine hydrochloride]] or topical [[Cortisol|hydrocortisone]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CZuBCwAAQBAJ|title = Williams Gynecology, Third Edition|last = Hoffman|first = Barbara|last2 = Schorge|first2 = John|last3 = Bradshaw|first3 = Karen|last4 = Halvorson|first4 = Lisa|last5 = Schaffer|first5 = Joseph|last6 = Corton|first6 = Marlene M.|date = 2016-04-22|publisher = McGraw Hill Professional|isbn = 9780071849098|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lichen sclerosus is another common cause of vulvitis in children, and it often affects an hourglass or figure eight-shaped area of skin around the anus and vulva. Symptoms of a mild case include skin fissures, loss of skin pigment ([[hypopigmentation]]), skin atrophy, a parchment-like texture to the skin, dysuria, itching, discomfort, and excoriation. In more severe cases, the vulva may become discolored, developing dark purple bruising ([[ecchymosis]]), bleeding, scarring, attenuation of the labia minora, and fissures and bleeding affecting the posterior [[Frenulum of labia minora|fourchette]]. Its cause is unknown, but likely genetic or autoimmune, and it is unconnected to malignancy in children. If the skin changes are not obvious on visual inspection, a biopsy of the skin may be performed to acquire an exact diagnosis. Treatment for vulvar lichen sclerosus may consist of topical hydrocortisone in mild cases, or stronger topical steroids (e.g. [[clobetasol propionate]]). Preliminary studies show that 75% of cases do not resolve with puberty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Organisms responsible for vulvitis in children include pinworms (''[[Enterobius vermicularis]]''), ''[[Candida albicans|Candida]]'' yeast, and [[Streptococcus pyogenes|group A hemolytic ''Streptococcus'']]. Though pinworms mainly affect the perianal area, they can cause itching and irritation to the vulva as well. Pinworms are treated with [[albendazole]]. Vulvar ''[[Candidiasis|Candida]]'' [[Candidiasis|infections]] are uncommon in children, and generally occur in infants after antibiotic therapy, and in children with [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] or [[immunodeficiency]]. ''Candida'' infections cause a red raised vulvar rash with satellite lesions and clear borders, and are diagnosed by microscopically examining a sample treated with potassium hydroxide for hyphae. They are treated with topical [[butoconazole]], [[clotrimazole]], or [[miconazole]]. ''Streptococcus'' infections are characterized by a dark red discoloration of the vulva and introitus, and cause pain, itching, bleeding, and dysuria. They are treated with antibiotics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1632">The '''Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill''' was a 1945 proposal to institute a national medical and hospitalization program. Senator [[Robert F. Wagner]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[New York (state)|New York]]), Senator [[James E. Murray]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Montana]]), and Representative [[John D. Dingell, Sr.]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Michigan]]) introduced it to the [[79th United States Congress]] on May 24, 1945. The bill was not passed. It is notable as an effort for [[health care reform in the United States]].

==History==
A similar bill of the same name was introduced in 1943 but not enacted. The 1945 attempt was distinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Donald W.|title=The Wagner Murray Dingell Bill (1945) - Senate Bill 1050 H.R. 3293|journal=The American Journal of Nursing|date=November 1945|volume=45|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

[[Henry Kraus]]' book, ''In the City was a Garden'', is about experiences of the resident's council of a World War II Garden Apartment (FHA) housing project for the war effort in San Pedro Ca. Chapter VI - Kaleidoscope of Change, gives an extended account of attempts to provide medical clinics in the projects and the California Medical Association response against what it called "government medicine." From a historical perspective, it is an interesting read on that subject and others of the time period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3451">'''Water supply in Cambodia''' is characterized by a low level of access in rural areas  compared to relatively high access to an [[improved water source]] in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Estimates for Cambodia|url=http://www.wssinfo.org/data-estimates/tables/|publisher=Joint Monitoring Programme for Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation of WHO and UNESCO|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 76% of the population had access to "improved" water, 100% in urban areas and 76% in rural areas. Still, in 2015, around 9 million did not have access to "improved" water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://washwatch.org/en/countries/cambodia/summary/statistics/|title=WASHwatch.org -      Cambodia|website=washwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the government, urban water supply policy is the responsibility of the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy. Service provision in urban areas is the responsibility of two water utilities in the largest cities, the [[Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority]] (PPWSA) and the [[Siem Reap]] Water Supply Authority (SRWSA), 11 Provincial Water Supply Authorities (known as PWWKs) as well as 147 smaller utilities. The Department of Rural Water Supply (DRWS) and Department of Rural Health Care (DRHC) of the Ministry of Rural Development are responsible for rural water supply for the smaller towns and villages with less than 1,000 households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water resource|url=http://www.cambodiainvestment.gov.kh/investors-information/infrastructure/water-resource.html|publisher=Council for the Development of Cambodia|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of the Provincial Water Supply Authorities, measured in terms of access, cost recovery through tariff revenues and [[non-revenue water]], lags behind the performance of PPWSA which has improved its performance significantly in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2012 the government of Cambodia launched a plan to bring the performance of the provincial utilities to levels comparable to those achieved by PPWSA by 2015, including their financial autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambodia set for national water turnaround|publisher=Global Water Intelligence|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the [[Asian Development Bank]] approved a grant to provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy to support this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project|url=http://www.adb.org/printpdf/projects/41403-012/main|publisher=Asian Development Bank|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many international NGOs provide support for drinking water supply in Cambodia through local NGOs, including [[Oxfam]] in [[Pursat Province]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambodia: Water for people, land, and livestock|url=http://www.oxfam.org/en/development/cambodia/water-people-land-livestock|publisher=Oxfam|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or Water for Cambodia that installs biosand filters in rural areas, runs the only water-testing laboratory outside the capital and promotes water literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Water, a Human Right not a Luxury|url=http://www.waterforcambodia.org/|publisher=Water for Cambodia|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''weGrow''', branded as the "first honest hydro store" and called the "[[Wal-Mart]] of Weed" by [[CNN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='''Walmart of Weed' to open in Arizona, promote growing your own'' |author= 'Michael Martinez' |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/05/31/arizona.marijuana.superstore/index.html?iref=allsearch |work=CNN |date=May 31, 2011 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a national [[hydroponics]] franchise that sells products and services to help patients cultivate [[medicinal marijuana]]. It is the first hydroponics store [[Medical cannabis in the United States|in the US]] that openly talks about cultivating cannabis for medical use.

== History  ==

weGrow was founded in January 2010 by [[CEO]] [[Dhar Mann]], a medical marijuana entrepreneur. He began franchising the brand in October of that year. weGrow currently has franchises in [[Sacramento, California]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona]], with a non-retail distribution hub in [[Oakland, California]].

weGrow stores do not sell marijuana. They sell the supplies and services that cultivators need to grow marijuana. They also provide education and advice on all aspects of medical marijuana cultivation. Stores give indoor grow demonstrations using real (non-marijuana) plants and offer classes on how medical marijuana can be safely and responsibly cultivated. On-site medical doctors perform patient evaluations, and expert technicians advise customers on building professional grow rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=''WalMart of Weed: A National Enterprise'' |author= 'Ye Tian' |url=http://oaklandnorth.net/2010/10/06/walmart-of-weed-wegrow-a-national-enterprise/  |newspaper=OaklandNorth.net |date=June 2, 2011 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
