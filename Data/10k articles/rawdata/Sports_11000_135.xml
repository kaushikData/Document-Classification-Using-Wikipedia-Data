In [[basketball]], the '''1-2-1-1 zone press''' (also called the '''diamond press''') pressures the in-bounds [[Point guard|passer]], and attempts to trap the first pass receiver, the technique is considered a "gamble".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.basketballforcoaches.com/1-2-1-1-diamond-press/|title=1-2-1-1 Diamond Press - Full Court - Coaching Guide {{!}} Basketball For Coaches|website=www.basketballforcoaches.com|access-date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
Two variations of the technique exist; "one fist", in which the defenders immediately trap the first pass and "two fist", in which the defenders wait until the first pass receiver puts the ball on the floor and starts the [[dribble]], and then quickly closes in and traps. In this situation, a player is waiting for the pass receiver to first commit with the dribble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.coachesclipboard.net/1211ZonePress.html|title=Basketball Defense – 1-2-1-1 Diamond Zone Press, Coach's Clipboard Basketball Coaching and Playbook|last=Gels|first=Dr. James|newspaper=Coach's Clipboard Basketball Coaching|access-date=2016-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231185753/http://www.coachesclipboard.net/1211ZonePress.html|archive-date=2011-12-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[Shaka Smart]] became one of the most well known users of this defense when put into his overall ''Havoc'' defense at his [[2010–11 VCU Rams men's basketball team]], which resulted in a [[2011 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|Final Four]] run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.burntorangenation.com/2015/4/3/8337897/shaka-smart-texas-longhorns-havoc-defense&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1938 Estonian Cup''' ({{lang-et|Eesti Karikas}}) was the '''first''' season of the [[Estonia]]n [[Football (soccer)|football]] knockout tournament. 11 teams took part of the competition. In that time there was no penalty shoot-out after extra time. Because of that another final had to be arranged as the first match ended 1–1. In the second match, played on November 6 in [[Kadrioru Stadium|Kadriorg Stadium]], '''[[SK Sport Tallinn|VS Sport Tallinn]]''' narrowly won over [[Tallinna Jalgpalliklubi]], thus becoming the first cup champions of [[Estonia]].

'''Aggie Memorial Stadium''' is an outdoor [[American football|football]] stadium on the campus of [[New Mexico State University]] in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. The stadium is the home field of the FBS independent [[New Mexico State University|New Mexico State]] [[New Mexico State Aggies football|Aggies]]. The venue opened in September 1978 and the current seating capacity is 30,343.  The artificial playing field sits at an elevation of 3,980 feet (1,213 m) [[AMSL|above sea level]]. It is the former home of NM State Aggies women's soccer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nmstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=1900&amp;ATCLID=3748849&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior to 1978==
Prior to 1978, the Aggies had played on the same site since 1933.  Located just to the northeast of Hadley Hall (the university's Administration building), and originally known as Quesenberry Field, the original Memorial Stadium was built over it in 1950. It was dedicated as a memorial to [[New Mexico State University|New Mexico A&amp;M]] students who had died in [[World War II]], [[World War I]], and the [[Spanish–American War]], among whom was Henry C. Gilbert Jr., whose parents were instrumental in the 10-year-long fundraising drive. Memorial Stadium, which served for 28 seasons, was replaced both due to its small size (at maximum, the seating capacity was only 12,155) and the want of an expanded athletics plant with more infrastructure and parking. (Currently Memorial Tower, which was originally part of the press box of the stadium, is the only remaining reminder of the stadium. It is now structurally incorporated into the university's Health and Social Services building and houses a memorial lounge and computer lab.)

==The "New" stadium==
The "new" Aggie Memorial Stadium, dedicated to [[alumni]] who had served in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]], was built for $4 million over a period of 18 months. It was funded by the state legislature as part of a capital project on the campus. The first home game saw the Aggies defeat rival [[University of Texas at El Paso|UTEP]] 35–32 on September 16, 1978. 20 years (and 10 days) later, the Aggies and Miners played to the largest crowd in stadium history, with 32,993 in attendance to see the Aggies win again, 33–24.

==Stadium design==
The stadium, designed by alumnus Craig Protz of Bohering-Protz Associates, was built just to the south of the [[Pan American Center]], the home of Aggie basketball. The stadium boasts a unique design in which earth that was excavated to construct the lower bowl and field level was moved to the sides of the stadium to support the upper level, with a street level concourse dividing the lower and upper bowls. The first level of seating wraps around the field, except for two {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} wide gaps behind each end zone. The southern end is a grass berm, with the Fulton Athletics Center, a $6 million structure constructed in 2004 housing athletics offices, an athletic training and education center, and club facilities, behind it. The northern end leads to the locker room facilities and main entrance to the stadium. Because of these gaps it was previously impossible to access the east side of the stadium from the west, and vice versa, without exiting the stadium and re-entering on the other side. A bridge over the north ramp constructed prior to the 2006 season now allows fans to cross from one side of the stadium to the other. The seating extends to a rounded second level on either side of the field, which extends the length of the playing field. The curved, undulating design of the upper level is reminiscent of similarly designed structures such as Memphis' [[Liberty Bowl Stadium]] and the now-demolished [[Tampa Stadium]], albeit on a somewhat smaller scale.

==Improvements==
The original four pole sodium vapor lighting system is now augmented by four additional smaller poles added prior to the 2005 season to increase the stadium's lighting capacity for televised night games. For the 2007 season, a new $1.5 million scoreboard including a 38'x23' video screen has been added to the facility, as well as a new team meeting and video room complex adjacent to the field house on the stadium's north end.

==Other uses==
In addition to football, the stadium occasionally hosts major concerts and other large outdoor gatherings on campus.

===Concerts===
Artists that have performed at the stadium include [[Metallica]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Faith No More]], [[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]], [[Vans Warped Tour]] &amp; [[Paul McCartney]], among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3603">The '''Art Rooney Award''' is given annually by the [[National Football League]] (NFL) in recognition of outstanding sportsmanship on the playing field. Established in 2015, the award is named in honor of [[Art Rooney]], the founding owner of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and a member of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].

The award is determined by a vote of the NFL players. The award is presented each year to an NFL player who demonstrates on the field the qualities of great sportsmanship, including fair play, respect for opponents, and integrity in competition.

Each NFL team nominates one player during the season. A panel of former players from the NFL Legends Community selected from the 32 nominees eight finalists (four in the [[American Football Conference]]; four in the [[National Football Conference]]). The panel of Legends Coordinators in the inaugural year was composed of [[Warrick Dunn]], [[Curtis Martin]], [[Karl Mecklenburg]] and [[Leonard Wheeler]]. Along with the award, the winner receives a $25,000 donation from the [[NFL Foundation]] to a charity of his choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000461948/article/sportsmanship-award-named-in-honor-of-art-rooney-sr|title=Sportsmanship Award named in honor of Art Rooney Sr.|publisher=National Football League|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinfuss|first1=Josh|title=Larry Fitzgerald wins first Art Rooney Award for sportsmanship|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/160607/larry-fitzgerald-wins-first-art-rooney-award-for-sportsmanship|accessdate=January 15, 2017|publisher=ESPN|date=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the '''[[1966 GANEFO]]''', the '''[[Athletics (sport)|athletics]]''' events were held in [[Phnom Penh]], Cambodia in November and December.&lt;ref name=DB&gt;Bell, Daniel (2003). ''Encyclopedia of International Games''. McFarland and Company, Inc. Publishers, Jefferson, North Carolina. {{ISBN|0-7864-1026-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 21 men's and 12 women's [[athletics events]] were contested at the competition.&lt;ref name=GBR&gt;[http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/gang.htm GANEFO Games]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2015-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The program was the same as the previous edition, except that the men's [[decathlon]] and [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] events were dropped. Composed entirely of athletes from Asian nations, the events served as a counterpart to the [[athletics at the 1966 Asian Games]], which featured largely Western-allied Asian nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/asg.htm Asian Games]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2015-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing on from the [[Athletics at the 1963 GANEFO|first GANEFO]], China dominated the athletics competition, winning nineteen of the gold medals on offer. [[North Korea]] was the next most successful with ten gold medals. [[North Vietnam]], [[Syria]] and [[Cambodia]] each won one gold medal each.&lt;ref name=GBR/&gt;

[[Ni Zhiqin]], China's leading men's [[high jump]]er, was the only man to defend his title from the 1963 games. [[Zheng Fengrong]], a former world record holder, added the high jump gold to the defence of her [[women's pentathlon]] title and also a [[80 metres hurdles]] bronze. The most successful athlete of the tournament was [[Sin Kim-dan]], who won the [[200 metres]], [[400 metres]] and [[800 metres]] titles – this meant she managed to defend all her 1963 titles.&lt;ref name=GBR/&gt;

The '''Techtonic Velodrome''' is a 250-meter, multi-purpose indoor [[velodrome]] located in [[Bellville, Western Cape|Bellville]] (about 25 kilometers outside of the centre of [[Cape Town]]), [[South Africa]]. 

The velodrome was initially developed for the South African Olympic Bid, this venue hosted the World Cycling Federation Championships in 1999. The project was completed in 9 months from inception.
The Velodrome features an acoustically treated soffit lining for purposes of hosting music and other entertainment events. The Velodrome was designed as a phased development with [[seating capacity]] on completion of up to 6000 seats (existing seats currently are 2500 and Event Organiser can provide the balance to bring it up to 6000 seats) or standing capacity is 7800. Phase 1 is complete and various designs exist as well as development proposals for the surrounding property to support the functions of the Velodrome.

The venue has served as Cape Town's main concert venue for the last ten years and has now been replaced by the [[Cape Town Stadium]]. Its maximum capacity for cycling competition would range from 5-8,000.

On September 5, 2007, [[WWE]]'s RAW SummerSlam Tour took place with over 7000 fans in attendance.

The velodrome hosted the 2007 UCI "B" World Championship in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldsite.uci.ch/modello.asp?1stLevelID=PA&amp;level1=0&amp;level2=0&amp;idnews=3962 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328230924/http://oldsite.uci.ch/modello.asp?1stLevelID=PA&amp;level1=0&amp;level2=0&amp;idnews=3962 |archivedate=2010-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also the venue for the [[2008 UCI Junior World Championships]], which was awarded to the city of Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southafrica.info/news/sport/cycling-240608.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also the home of the [[Organised Chaos LAN Party]], South Africa's biggest monthly [[gamer|gaming]] event. Organised Chaos moved to a different venue after the commencing of The Galleria Development early in 2012, but still make use of the Bellville Velodrome for large events from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oc.co.za]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Galleria Development==
At a Council meeting on 28 October 2009, approval was given for the City of Cape Town to award a R3 billion tender to establish retail, business, residential, hotel and conference facilities on an 11.5 ha property in the Bellville Velodrome precinct.

The tender was won by Devmet Property Developments, a consortium of Devmark Property Group (Pty) Limited and Mettle Property Group (Pty) Limited, through a competitive bidding process that lasted more than two years. Mettle Property Group is 49% owned by Metropolitan Capital, an associated company of the Metropolitan Group, and is a level eight contributor in terms of Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE).

The development is based on a spine ‘Galleria’ that will provide the circulation and connection to all the facilities.  Parking with entrances at various levels and locations will be provided to connect the hotel, conference and sporting facilities with the retail, business and residential components.

Devmet Property Developments has put together a group of companies and management models that offer a suitable range of skills and experience in property development, property management, financial oversight, facilities management and events management. They incorporate and provide local and international experience, strategic partnerships and networks, and innovative technologies, designs and processes.  The group includes Devmet, Big Concerts, the High Performance Sports Centre and several smaller, specialist firms,” Gelderbloem added.

The overally capacity of the venue will be increased to 18,000 with the upgrade to the velodrome and adjoining athletics venue considered as part of Phase 1.

It was initially envisaged that the development will be completed by 2014, however, as of November 2013, no construction work has taken place. There was some concern as to the developments effect on the surrounding suburbs as a road will need to be built through local suburbs and parks, but after public hearings the plan to build a road was withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kenridgeratepayers.co.za/news/kenridge-news/story/871/public-meeting-bellville-velodrome-12-june-2013-19h00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Following initial success, in mid-2015 this chain was expanded to the area around Milan but failed later that year.&lt;ref name=chi /&gt; Due to financial losses due to Stefano De Martino's failed entrepreneurial adventures,&lt;ref name=chi /&gt; Belen had to sell for example the ''[[Imperfect]]'' brand just to pay the financial hole created by Stefano De Martino.&lt;ref name=chi /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3901">[[File:City Chess Elista Kalmykia.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The main building of the Chess City complex]]

'''Chess City''' (also referred to as '''City-Chess'''; {{lang-ru|Сити-Чесс}} ''Siti-Chess'' or {{lang|ru|Город Шахмат}} ''Gorod Shakhmat'', {{lang-xal|Сити-Чесс}}, ''Siti-Çess'') is a large complex devoted to [[chess]] and chess competitions located east of [[Elista]], [[Kalmykia]], in [[Russia]].  The neighborhood-size development consists of a central, four-story domed City Chess Hall surrounded by an [[Olympic Village|Olympic-style village]] of Californian-[[Mediterranean Revival Style architecture]].  The site has a conference center, public swimming pool and a museum of Kalmyk [[Buddhist art]].  The complex features sculptures and artwork devoted to chess, including a statue of [[Ostap Bender]], a fictional character of popular books written by Ilya Ilf and Yevgeni Petrov, who proposed a creation of world chess capital.  The complex has been used to host visiting dignitaries like the [[Dalai Lama]].

Completed in 1998, the idea and development of Chess City is directly the result of [[Kirsan Ilyumzhinov]], Kalmykia's millionaire President who has ruled the republic since 1993 and been president of [[FIDE]], the international governing body of chess, since 1995.  A fanatical chess enthusiast,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,442158,00.html The Dictator and His Hobby: Kalmykian Leader Makes Farce of Chess Championships - International - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ilyumzhinov had the complex built in time for the [[33rd Chess Olympiad]].

Chess City has hosted three major FIDE tournaments: the XXXIII [[Chess Olympiad]] in 1998, the 2004 [[Women's World Chess Championship]], and the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2006|2006 World Chess Championship]].

Future plans for Chess City include a water sport complex, skiing center, government buildings, business centers, opera and ballet theaters, museums, a conservatory, an art school, religious academies, a center of traditional medicine, and residences for any ambassadors who may be accredited to Kalmykia.

==Controversy==

Kalmykia is a poor republic of approximately 300,000 people located in the barren [[steppe]] regions in the southeastern corner of Europe.  Without much in terms of natural resources, the nation is economically depressed and many of its citizens live in poverty.&lt;ref name=NYT062004&gt;Seth Mydans, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/international/europe/20russ.html Where Chess Is King and the People Are the Pawns], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 20, 2004, Accessed May 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the construction of the opulent Chess City was greatly criticized for spending large sums of money on a tourist resort.  Chess tournament winners are sometimes rewarded with a diamond [[tiara]].  Additionally, the desert climate of the area puts many of the planned expansions for Chess City, like the water sports complex, under scrutiny.&lt;ref name="NYT062004"/&gt;

'''Ferney Park''' is a [[football (soccer)|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Ballinamallard]], [[County Fermanagh]], [[Northern Ireland]]. It is the home stadium of [[Ballinamallard United F.C.|Ballinamallard United]]. It was first used by Ballinamallard United in 1975, when the club was founded&lt;!--was this the first time it was used at all?--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/meet-the-mighty-mallards-the-little-ducks-who-ruffled-linfields-feathers-28871872.html |title=Meet the Mighty Mallards... the little ducks who ruffled Linfield's feathers |publisher=Belfast Telegraph |date=2012-10-10 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Since 2006, Ferney Park has undergone a number of renovations.&lt;ref name=ren /&gt; The ground did not meet the criteria for use in the [[IFA Championship]], which was established in 2008, and Ballinamallard played its home matches at [[Holm Park]], the home of [[Armagh City F.C.|Armagh City]], during the 2008/09 season and the first part of 2009/10, while it was brought up to standard. Ballinamallard's first match back at the upgraded Ferney Park was on 5 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''Impartial Reporter'', 3 December 2009, [http://www.impartialreporter.com/sport/football/articles/2009/12/03/390350-time-to-stand-and-deliver/ Time to stand and deliver]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifachampionship.com/report051209_balapor.htm Ballinamallard United 0-5 Portadown]&lt;/ref&gt; Floodlights were installed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifachampionship.com/news160310_2.htm Let There Be Light!]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Ballinamallard United were promoted to the [[IFA Premiership]] after receiving a domestic licence to do so from the [[Irish Football Association]].&lt;ref name=utv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u.tv/Sport/IFA-makes-new-season-licence-decisions/fc87ce98-7503-48c1-b037-1ab553ec9923 |title=IFA makes new season licence decisions |publisher=UTV |date= |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However at the time, Ferney Park did not meet the required standards. The club were in the process of building two new stands, funded by fans buying seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/roundup/articles/2012/06/23/397160-video-ballinamallard-utd-prepare-for-top-flight-football/ |title=VIDEO: Ballinamallard Utd prepare for top flight football |publisher=Impartial Reporter |date=2012-06-23 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans and designs of the new stands were printed on the cover of the matchday programme for United's last game before being promoted against [[Ards F.C.|Ards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/roundup/articles/2012/04/28/396518-party-time-at-ferney-park/ |title=Party time at Ferney Park |publisher=Impartial Reporter |date=2012-04-28 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building of the stands could not be guaranteed to be completed before the start of the Irish Premiership season. As a result, the club were obliged to nominate [[Stangmore Park]] in [[Dungannon]], [[County Tyrone]] as their home ground if construction could not be finished in time.&lt;ref name=utv /&gt; At a cost of £80,000 from four fans, the pitch at Ferney Park was also re-laid in preparation.&lt;ref name=ren&gt;{{cite web|last=Edgar |first=Damien |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19154740 |title=Mallards ready to mix it with elite |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the work was finished in time for Ferney Park to be used to host Ballinamallard's opening game against [[Dungannon Swifts F.C.|Dungannon Swifts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=GMT |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19209310 |title=Ballinamallard prepare for Premiership bow against Dungannon |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2012-08-10 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new stands were also officially opened for this match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fermanaghherald.com/2012/08/new-stands-officially-opened-at-ferney-park/ |title=New stands officially opened at Ferney Park |publisher=Fermanagh Herald |date=2012-08-15 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, during half-time in a match between Ballinamallard United and [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]], the Ferney Park [[pitch invasion|pitch was invaded]] by twenty Linfield supporters who waved [[Union Flag]]s from the centre of the pitch. This was done as part of the [[Belfast City Hall flag protests]]. Ballinamallard United had no prior warning that this would happen and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] took no actions amid fears of inflaming the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/roundup/articles/2012/12/11/399142-mallards-disgusted-after-flag-protest/ |title=Mallards 'disgusted' after flag protest |publisher=Impartial Reporter |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2013-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213174640/http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/roundup/articles/2012/12/11/399142-mallards-disgusted-after-flag-protest/ |archivedate=13 December 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Ferney Park is home to Ballinamallard United and is also used to host their reserves' matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impartialreporter.com/sport/football/articles/2012/12/28/399316-reserves-take-second-half-chances-to-stay-top/ |title=Reserves take second half chances to stay top |publisher=Impartial Reporter |date=2012-12-28 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also home to the [[Fermanagh Mallards F.C.|Fermanagh Mallards]] women's football club. In 2012, Ferney Park was used to host the opening game of the [[Northern Ireland Milk Cup]] between Fermanagh and [[England|English]] side, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nimilkcup.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=136:ferney-park-gives-fermanagh-factor-to-milk-cup |title=Ferney Park Gives Fermanagh Factor to Milk Cup |publisher=Milk Cup |date= |accessdate=2013-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101210153/http://www.nimilkcup.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=136%3Aferney-park-gives-fermanagh-factor-to-milk-cup |archivedate=1 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to commemorate the Milk Cup's 30th anniversary by playing competition matches away from the normal locations along the north coast of Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impartialreporter.com/sport/football/articles/2012/07/19/397413-quinn-hoping-ferney-park-will-provide-home-comfort/ |title=Quinn hoping Ferney Park will provide home comfort |publisher=Impartial Reporter |date=2012-07-19 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferney Park has received a reputation in Northern Irish football as being a difficult ground to find&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Liam |last=Beckett |url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/liam-beckett-enjoys-his-journey-to-ferney-park-ballinamallard-1-4232123 |title=Liam Beckett enjoys his journey to Ferney Park, Ballinamallard |publisher=News Letter |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with members of the media covering games at the stadium often getting lost on their way to it.&lt;ref name=ren /&gt; This sometimes led to television channels having to use Ballinamallard United's own coverage of matches to be broadcast on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u.tv/Sport/Ballinamallard-upset-Distillery/2003b334-377e-4120-a974-bfe58baf6527 |title=Ballinamallard upset Distillery |publisher=UTV |date= |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was often attributed to television companies deeming it too expensive to regularly send cameras to Ballinamallard.&lt;ref name=fh /&gt; This situation has been criticized by Ballinamallard residents who feel that television coverage of Ballinamallard United is not as detailed as other teams because of the location of Ferney Park.&lt;ref name=fh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fermanaghherald.com/2013/01/tv-companies-accused-of-lacklustre-ballinamallard-coverage/ |title=TV companies accused of lacklustre Ballinamallard coverage |publisher=Fermanagh Herald |date=2013-01-25 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Flyboard''' is a brand of [[hydroflight]]ing device which supplies propulsion to drive the Flyboard into the air to perform a sport known as hydroflying.&lt;ref name="examples"&gt;Examples: [https://powerboardexpert.com/what-is-a-flyboard/ Flyboard Ultimate Supercut] Power Board Expert.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A Flyboard rider stands on a board connected by a long hose to a watercraft. Water is forced under pressure to a pair of boots with jet nozzles underneath which provide thrust for the rider to fly up to {{Convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the air or to dive headlong through the water down to {{Convert|2.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/zapata-flyboard-jet-pack-watersport-boots/20772/ Zapata's outrageous, US$6,600 Flyboard - Aquaman meets Iron Man], gizmag.com. Retrieved: 13 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2016}}

== History ==
The Flyboard was invented in Autumn 2012 by a [[France|French]] water-craft rider, Franky Zapata.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HIST"&gt;[http://www.zapata-racing.com/en/flyboard/historique/ History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806054354/http://www.zapata-racing.com/en/flyboard/historique/ |date=August 6, 2013 }}, zapata-racing.com. Retrieved: 13 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The design allows the device to climb out of the water and be stable in the air. This was achieved by the underfoot propulsion and hand stabilization.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt; The French [[Institut national de la propriété industrielle]] (INPI) granted Zapata a patent for his invention.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt; The Flyboard was the subject of a lawsuit from competitor [[Jetlev]] which was dropped without prejudice in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.priorsmart.com/li-v-flyboard-l6kw/ |title=Li et. al. v. Flyboard, Inc. et. al.|publisher=PriorSmart |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was presented to the public for the first time at the jet ski World Championship 2012 in China.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;  Since its introduction in 2012 the Flyboard has sold around 2500 units.

In the 2015 season of [[America's Got Talent]], a flyboard enthusiast named Damone Rippy performed Flyboarding as his act on the show.

== Technical information ==

The Flyboard is a bolt-on device that is attached to a [[personal water craft]] (PWC). It is designed so that the PWC follows behind the rider’s trail, allowing the rider multiple degrees of freedom, even allowing the rider to go underwater if they desire. The pilot on the Flyboard is secured in by bindings similar to a [[wakeboard]] and the rider is propelled from water jets below the device. The Flyboard is [[buoyant]] for safety, which also allows the rider to rest in the water between rides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zapata-racing.com/flyboard/technique/ Explications Techniques], zapata-racing.com. Retrieved: 10 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a [[personal flotation device]] and helmet is required by rental locations for safety purposes to protect against serious head trauma in the event of the rider impacting the PWC or stationary structures, and to protect the ears from damage and discomfort from impacts with the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiaflyboard.com/FAQ.aspx#14|title=FAQ|work=California Flyboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h2romagazine.com/flyboard-history|title=Zapata Racing &amp; the Flyboard|work=H2RO Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Device power is controlled by a throttle on the PWC. The equipment may be used in two modes: The primary one requires two people, one to control the PWC throttle which regulates the power and height of the rider. The secondary mode relies on an accessory called an Electronic Management Kit (EMK) which allows the rider to control the PWC throttle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h2romagazine.com/professional-flyboarders-h2ro/flyboard-pros-talk-electronic-management-kit|title=Flyboard Pros Talk Electronic Management Kit|work=H2RO Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitions ==
The first Flyboard World Championships took place in [[Doha]], Qatar in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogonews.com/2012/10/29/flyboarding-the-new-extreme-sport Flyboarding - The New Extreme Sport?], dogonews.com. Retrieved: 13 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movies ==
For the first time, a Flyboard stunt was done in a [[Bollywood]] film by [[Hrithik Roshan]] in the film ''[[Bang Bang!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-hrithik-beats-hollywood-heroes-in-doing-daring-stunts-2005005|title=Hrithik beats Hollywood heroes in doing daring stunts|work=dna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilbert Meriel''' (born 11 November 1986) is a soccer player from [[Tahiti]] currently playing for [[A.S. Vénus]] and for the [[Tahiti national football team]]. He was part of the Tahitian squad at the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.footballdatabase.eu/football.joueurs.gilbert.meriel.198743.en.html|title=Profile|date=|work=Football Database|accessdate=6 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meriel started playing soccer at the age of nine on Tahitian club [[A.S. Vénus]]. Five years later, he went to France to join the youth academy at [[Angers SCO]], where he stayed for three years. While in France, Meriel also played for [[US Jeanne d'Arc Carquefou]] competing in the lower leagues, before returning home at 18. Upon his return home Meriel, like many of his national team colleagues, was forced to get another job and become a [[semi-professional]] athlete. Metiel earned a bachelor in economy and administration, becoming an [[auditor]] for consulting group [[KPMG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/players/player=360634/profile.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618010234/http://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/players/player%3D360634/profile.html |archivedate=June 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Confederations Cup, Meriel had his first [[cap (sports)|cap]] as the starting goalkeeper for Tahiti's in the squad's final game against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in [[Recife]].  While Tahiti lost 8-0, Meriel was applauded once he saved a penalty kick from the eventually sent-off [[Andres Scotti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23022840 |title=Confederations Cup: Tahitian delight at penalty save |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=2013-06-23 |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/matches/round=255199/match=300222465/summary.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804205409/http://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/matches/round%3D255199/match%3D300222465/summary.html |archivedate=August 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kiel Auditorium''' was an [[Arena|indoor arena]] located in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. It was the home of the [[Saint Louis University|St. Louis University]] basketball team and hosted the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[St. Louis Hawks]], from 1955 to 1968.

[[Image:Kiel-mohistsoc.jpg|thumb|left|Municipal Auditorium as it appeared in a 1934 nighttime view]]
[[Image:The Rolling Stones 1972 by Dan Volonnino.jpg|thumb|left|The Rolling Stones performing at Kiel Auditorium in 1972]]

The arena, completed in 1934, at a cost of $6 million, seated 9,300 and was built by Fruin-Colnon Construction.  It was originally named the '''Municipal Auditorium''', but was renamed in honor of former St. Louis Mayor [[Henry Kiel]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;http://basketball.ballparks.com/&lt;/ref&gt; A unique feature of the auditorium was that it was split into two; the front of the building was the [[Peabody Opera House|Kiel Opera House]]. It was possible to use both sides at once as the stages were back to back. President [[Harry Truman]] gave a speech there in which both sides were opened to see his speech.

The Kiel Auditorium replaced the [[St. Louis Coliseum]] as the city's main indoor arena.

In 1955, the auditorium was also the venue for the second international conference of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], which established the service conference structure for the movement.

Kiel Auditorium played host to a variety of concerts and wrestling events, from the 1950s, until its closure in 1991. In [[Miss Universe 1983|1983]], it was the host of the [[Miss Universe Pageant]]. From the 1950s until the 1970s, the Kiel Auditorium was behind only [[Madison Square Garden]] as North America's most famous wrestling arena, hosting three [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] title changes from 1959 until 1986. The most notable wrestling event that took place at the Kiel Auditorium was WCW's premier event, [[Starrcade 1990]]. The building was demolished in 1992, but not before hosting the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] men's basketball tournament the preceding year.

After its demolition, its games and concerts temporarily went to the [[St. Louis Arena]].

The [[Enterprise Center]] (originally named "Kiel Center", then "Savvis Center", then "Scottrade Center", before the current [[naming rights]] were purchased) now stands on the site of the former Kiel Auditorium. The Opera House portion of the building, on the northern part of the property, facing Market Street, was not torn down. It remained vacant for a while, but was renovated and reopened under the name [[Peabody Opera House]] in 2011.

The '''National Games of Colombia''', known in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as the ''Juegos Deportivos  Nacionales'', is the premier [[multi-sport event]] of [[Colombia]] at national level.  The first instance of the event was organized in 1928 and for several years it took place at irregular intervals of time.  The Colombian Sports Institute ({{lang-es|Instituto Colombiano del Deporte}}) took charge of the organization of the games in 1968.  The event has been held regularly every 4 years since 1988. 

[[Valle del Cauca]] has been the most successful department in the history of the national games (7 times), followed by [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] (6 times) and next [[Bogotá]] (one time).

'''Odsal Stadium''', is a sports stadium in [[Odsal]], [[Bradford]], West Yorkshire. The stadium is currently home of [[Bradford Bulls]] Rugby League team as well as previously home to the [[motorcycle speedway|speedway]] team [[Bradford Dukes]], as well the football team [[Bradford City]] following the [[Bradford City stadium fire|Valley Parade fire]]. Odsal has also been a venue for baseball, basketball, [[kabbadi]], [[show jumping]], tennis, live music and international Rugby League. It is also the [[List of Rugby League stadiums in England|largest rugby league stadium in England]].

The stadium holds the British attendance records for a Rugby match, 102,569 in 1954 at the rugby league [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]]-[[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] [[Challenge Cup]] Final replay,{{sfn | Delaney | 1991 | p=48 }}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = There were a lot more than that: Odsal 1954|last = Gate|first = Robert|publisher = R.E.

==History==

===1933-1935: Construction and opening===
Formed in 1907, the Bradford Northern club had played at a number of venues including the [[Greenfield Athletic Ground]] in [[Dudley Hill]] and Bowling Old Lane Cricket Club's ground in [[Birch Lane]].{{sfn|Delaney|1991|pp=44–45}} By the early 1920s, however, Birch Lane's limitations were clear and Northern began to seek another home. Precarious finances prevented the club being able to take up an offer to develop land off Rooley Lane or to upgrade and move back to Greenfield, but in 1933, [[Bradford City Council]] gave them the opportunity to transform land at [[Odsal]] Top into their [[home ground]]. On 20 June 1933 the club therefore signed a ten-year deal on the site, which was to become the biggest stadium in England outside [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].{{sfn|Delaney|1991|p=45}}

The site was a former quarry which was then being used as a landfill tip. Ernest Call M.B.E., the Director of Cleansing for [[Bradford City Council]] devised a system of controlled tipping that saw 140,000 cart loads of household waste deposited to form the characteristic banking at Odsal. The club were to be responsible for boundary fencing, dressing rooms and seated accommodation.

To be able to turf the [[Rugby league playing field|pitch]], and other areas, a turf fund was put into place which raised a total of £900 to cover the work. A stand was erected at the cost of £2,000, which was paid for by the [[Rugby Football League]]. It held 1,500 on a mixture of benches and [[tip-up seat]]s.

The ground was officially opened by Sir Joseph Taylor, President of Huddersfield on 1 September 1934. His club went on to beat the hosts 31–16, [[Rugby league in Australia|Australian]] [[winger (sports)|winger]] Ray Markham scoring four [[try|tries]] in front of an estimated 20,000.{{sfn|Delaney|1991|p=45-46}} The clubhouse and dressing rooms were officially opened before a match against [[Hull F.C.]] on 2 February 1935. Contemporary pictures show that as late as August 1935 the banking on the Rooley Avenue side was still being created.{{sfn|Delaney|1991|p=45}}

===1940-1979: Speedway and Rugby League internationals===
In 1945, speedway began in Bradford with the [[Odsal Boomerangs]]. In the post-[[Second World War]] years, speedway proved extremely popular with crowds of over 20,000 regularly attending meetings at Odsal, with the 1946 average for the first year of the [[National League (1932–64)|National League]] after the war. The highest speedway attendance during this period came on 5 July 1947 when 47,050 fans saw [[England national speedway team|England]] defeat [[Australia national speedway team|Australia]] 65-43 in a Test match. This remains the largest-ever speedway crowd for Odsal Stadium.

During the [[Second World War]], the lower floor of the clubhouse was also used as an [[Air Raid Precautions]] centre, and one of the dressing rooms was the map room.{{sfn | Delaney | 1991 | pp=46 }} On 20 December 1947, the largest ever attendance for an international test at Odsal was set when 42,685 saw [[England national rugby league team|England]] defeat [[New Zealand Kiwis|New Zealand]] 25–9. The first [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlit]] rugby match in the [[Northern England|North of England]] was held at Odsal in 1951.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} In September 1951, Council Engineer Ernest Wardley drew up a plan for a 92,000 capacity 'European' style stadium, at a cost of £250,000.&lt;ref name="bantamspast"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bantamspast.co.uk/grounds/odsal.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217141638/http://www.bantamspast.co.uk/grounds/odsal.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 February 2011 |title=Odsal |date= |website=bantamspast |publisher=The Bradford City Football Club Museum |accessdate=9 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually £50,000 was spent on terracing the Rooley Avenue end in 1964, before the Wardley plan was officially dropped the following year.&lt;ref name="bantamspast" /&gt;

After a disastrous 1960 season, the Panthers (previously the Odsal Boomerangs) left Odsal and in 1961 moved across town to the [[Greenfield Stadium, Bradford|Greenfield Stadium]], better known for [[greyhound racing]]. After the Panthers folded in 1962, Motorcycle Speedway would not return to Bradford for another 10 years.

Speedway returned to Odsal when promoters Les Whaley, Mike Parker and Bill Bridgett moved the [[British League Division Two]] side [[Nelson Admirals]] across the [[Pennines]] for the final eleven league meetings of the 1970 season and went on to adopt Bradford Northern as their name and red, black and amber as their colours. Northern would finish second in Division 2 in 1971, but from there results and attendances steadily declined and the team folded after 1973.

The second test of the [[The Ashes (rugby league)|1978 Ashes series]] was played at Odsal, with [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] defeating [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] before a crowd of 26,761. The Lions team that day featured what was called a "Dad's Army" front row with [[Jim Mills (rugby league)|Jim Mills]], [[Tony Fisher (rugby)|Tony Fisher]] and [[Brian Lockwood]] all being over the age of 30.

===1980-1990s: Bradford City and the return of Speedway===
The ground's clubhouse had to be refurbished when it was condemned in the mid-1980s. The social facilities were also upgraded at the same time.

Speedway returned to Odsal in 1985 after a ten-year absence when it was selected by the [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] to host the [[1985 Individual Speedway World Championship|1985 World Final]].

Following the [[Bradford City stadium fire|Valley Parade fire]] disaster of 1985, [[Bradford City]] played a handful of games at [[Leeds Road]] and [[Elland Road]] whilst the future of Valley Parade was decided.{{Nonspecific|date=April 2013}} On 23 September 1985, a [[Football League]] delegation visited Odsal to view the stadium to pass it fit to host City's home games. Segregation fences were erected on the old Main Stand side and 1,000 uncovered seats were bolted onto the terracing – it was planned to install 7,000 in the future. Meanwhile, a further £1&amp;nbsp;million was spent to conform with new safety standards – bringing the total spent on Odsal to £3.5&amp;nbsp;million. New boundary walls, turnstiles, exit gates, a bus layby in Rooley Avenue and access road were added. Odsal played host to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City's]] [[Football League Championship|Division Two]] home games until December 1986. Odsal Stadium also held a modern-day attendance record for almost six years.{{clarify|date=February 2012}}

Like most British stadia, Odsal had its capacity substantially reduced by the safety measures introduced in the 1990s following the [[Hillsborough disaster]] and the findings of the [[Taylor Report]].

===2000-present: Redevelopments===
At the dawn of the [[Super League]] era in 1996, Bradford Bulls wanted to attract new sponsors but had poor and outdated hospitality suites. In 2000 they announced plans to build hospitality suites at the South End of the stadium which would mean building on the track around the pitch, effectively ending Speedways association with Bradford. Construction started in 2001 and was completed in 2002 with Bradford Bulls playing two seasons at [[Valley Parade]].

After London won the right to host the [[2012 Olympic Games]] in 2008, plans were put in place for an Olympic Legacy Park at Odsal, which would mean redeveloping the stadium and the Richard Dunn Leisure Centre opposite. Although these plans never came to fruition and a Legacy Park was built in Sheffield instead.

In 2012, the Bulls got into financial difficulties and the RFL stepped in and bought the lease to Odsal. In early 2017 the Bulls were liquidated and a new club was formed by Andrew Chalmers who wants to redevelop Odsal into a venue fit for Super League and international rugby league.

In 2018 it was revealed [[Bradford Park Avenue]] were in discussions about moving to Odsal.

==Usage==
===Speedway===
The rugby pitch at Odsal Stadium is surrounded by a {{convert|390|yd|m}} [[Dirt track racing|speedway]] track which was used mostly for [[Motorcycle speedway]], though the stadium also hosted stock car racing.

After finishing at the bottom of the National League in 1948 and 1949, the Boomerangs folded and were replaced in 1950 by the [[Bradford Tudors|Odsal Tudors]]. Despite the name change, fortunes remained the same with the Tudors finishing on the bottom of the NL ladder in 1951. In 1959 the Tudors dropped the Odsal name and were renamed the Bradford Tudors. The most famous of the Tudors riders was English star [[Nigel Boocock]] who rode for the team from 1955-1957.

In 1960, the Bradford Tudors renamed themselves the Bradford Panthers. After a disastrous 1960 season, the Panthers left Odsal and in 1961 moved across town to the [[Greenfield Stadium, Bradford|Greenfield Stadium]], better known for [[greyhound racing]]. After the Panthers folded in 1962, Motorcycle Speedway would not return to Bradford for another 10 years.

The sound of speedway bikes was heard once again at Odsal when promoters Les Whaley, Mike Parker and Bill Bridgett moved the [[British League Division Two]] side [[Nelson Admirals]] across the [[Pennines]] for the final eleven league meetings of the 1970 season. The Admirals became Bradford Northern like their rugby league landlords and even adopted their red, black and amber colours, though the move was met with opposition from the nearby [[Halifax Dukes]]. Northern would finish second in Div.II in 1971, but from there results and attendances steadily declined and again, a Bradford speedway team folded after 1973.

Speedway wasn't lost to Bradford, or Odsal though as from the [[Bradford Barons]] were formed, but they were also short lived and only lasted the years 1974 and 1975. Speedway would once again not return to Bradford for another 10 years.

Speedway returned to Odsal in 1985 after a ten-year absence when it was selected by the [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] to host the [[1985 Individual Speedway World Championship|1985 World Final]], the first time the Final in England would not be held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. In the three years after the [[1981 Individual Speedway World Championship|1981 World Final]] at Wembley, international speedway's home in Great Britain had been the [[White City Stadium]] in London. However, with the closure of White City in 1985 a new home would be needed and the 30,000 capacity Odsal was chosen. A capacity crowd at the 1985 World Final saw a titanic fight between [[Denmark]]'s defending [[Speedway World Championship|World Champion]] [[Erik Gundersen]], his fellow countryman [[Hans Nielsen (speedway rider)|Hans Nielsen]], and American rider [[Sam Ermolenko]]. The trio all finished the meeting on 13 points each which saw a three-way runoff for the top 3 placings with Gundersen winning from Nielsen and Ermolenko. Just a month prior to the World Final, Odsal also hosted the Overseas Final as part of the World Final qualifications. That meeting saw two riders finish at the top on 14 points, American [[Shawn Moran]] and English favourite, Halifax Dukes rider [[Kenny Carter]]. Moran would defeat Carter in the runoff for the Overseas title.

In March 1986, Odsal opened its doors to [[British League]] action for the first time since the 1950s after the Halifax Dukes were offered a new home track. The new 'Bradford Dukes' team would in later years include World Champions [[Gary Havelock]] and [[Mark Loram]], multiple British and [[Individual Speedway Long Track World Championship|Long Track World Champions]] [[Simon Wigg]] and [[Kelvin Tatum]], and dual [[Australian Individual Speedway Championship|Australian Champion]] [[Glenn Doyle]]. However, the club suffered the tragic loss of Kenny Carter who died in murder/suicide after shooting his wife and then himself at their home in May 1986.

Odsal Stadium hosted its second World Final in [[1990 Individual Speedway World Championship|1990]]. [[Swedish people|Swedish]] rider [[Per Jonsson]] won his only World Championship when he defeated Shawn Moran in a runoff after both had finished the meeting on 13 points. Moran was later stripped of his silver medal by the FIM after he had tested positive to a drug test taken three months earlier at the Overseas Final in [[Coventry]]. Moran claimed that the drug he took was a pain killer prescribed by a doctor in Sweden, but the FIM stood firm. They also did not upgrade the standings and the official records show no second place rider. Young Australian rider [[Todd Wiltshire]] riding in his first World Final surprised many by finishing in third place with 12 points.

From 1987, Bradford speedway then enjoyed its greatest period of success, winning eight trophies until the club's closure in 1997 when despite winning the [[Elite League (speedway)|Elite League]], the club folded for the third time.

Odsal Stadium hosted the [[1997 Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain|1997]] [[Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain]]. Danish rider [[Brian Andersen]] won the Grand Prix from America's [[1996 Speedway Grand Prix|reigning World Champion]] [[Billy Hamill]], with Swede [[Jimmy Nilsen]] finishing third in the Final. Bradford Dukes rider Mark Loram finished 4th in the Final. Loram would later go on to be the [[2000 Speedway Grand Prix|2000 World Champion]] after winning the [[Speedway Grand Prix]] series that year.

==Layout==
===Rooley Avenue End===
[[File:Odsal Rooley Avenue End.jpg|200px|right]]
'''Capacity- 7,290 (standing)'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Rooley Avenue End is situated at the Northern end of the stadium. It is open terracing and is where the big screen is erected for televised games. The stand has turnstiles that back onto Rooley Avenue.

===East Stand===
[[File:Odsal main stand.jpg|200px|right]]
'''Capacity- 4,890 (seating)'''&lt;br /&gt;
The East Stand is the only part of the ground that is covered and has seating. The stand runs parallel to the pith and has ''BULLS'' spelt out on the seats. The stand houses hone supporters and most season ticket holders as well as the press and some executive seats. There is also bars and toilets at the top of the stand.

===South Bank===
[[File:South Bank.jpg|200px|right]]
'''Capacity- 620 (seating)'''&lt;br /&gt;
The South Bank is the stadiums hospitality stand which sits at the Southern end of the ground. It has two levels each containing a banquiting suite and seats looking out onto the pitch. Speedway ended its association with Odsal after the hospitality building was built on turns 3 and 4.

===West Stand===
[[File:West Stand at Odsal.jpg|200px|right]]
'''Capacity- 9,309 (standing)'''&lt;br /&gt;
The West Stand is uncovered terracing and houses the players changing rooms and tunnel as well as TV gantry at the top of the stand. The supporters bar is located in the north-west corner of the stand and also houses a manual scoreboard and clock. At the top of the stand, on ground level with Rooley Avenue is the car park and club shop and ticket office. There are a few hospitality boxes at the top of the stand bit these are not used after the construction of the South Bank.

===The pitch===
The pitch at Odsal has a distinctive concave contour, with the corners of the pitch behind the try-line noticeably sloping up towards the stands. This was due to the stadium being used to host [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] events and so the corners of the pitch were removable to allow full use of the track. With the end of speedway at Odsal, the upturned corners are no longer as pronounced as they once were.

===Future===
As there has been little investment in the stadium, apart from the South Bank being built in 2002, most of the stadium is run down. In the run up to the 2012 London Olympics, Bradford City Council applied for an Olympic Legacy Park to be built at Odsal and the site of Richards Dunn Sport Centre. Bradford's bid was turned down in favour of Sheffield, which means it is highly unlikely and improvements will be made to Odsal in the near future. However when Andrew Chalmers bought the club in 2017, he expressed an interest in redeveloping the stadium for it to be fit for Super League and future international test matches.

[[File:Arirang Mass Games 01.JPG|thumb|Exterior of Rungrado May Day Stadium]]
[[File:Arirang Mass Games 12.JPG|thumb|[[Arirang Festival]], on the occasion of the 100th Anniversary of the birth of [[Kim Il-sung]].]]

The '''Rungrado 1st of May Stadium''', also known as the '''May Day Stadium''', is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Rŭngrado|Rungra Island]], [[Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]] which was opened on 1 May 1989. Its first major event was the [[13th World Festival of Youth and Students]]. It is the [[list of stadiums by capacity|largest stadium in the world]], with a total capacity of approximately 114,000. The site occupies an area of {{Convert|20.7|ha|acre}}. It is commonly confused with the nearby 50,000 capacity [[Kim Il-sung Stadium]] due to proximity, but possesses unique size and seating capacities which provide distinction.

==Name==
Its name comes from [[Rŭngrado|Rungra Island]] in the [[Taedong River]], upon which it is situated, and from the [[International Workers' Day]] celebrated on [[May Day]] every year.

==Uses==
It is currently used for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches, a few [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]] events, but most often for the [[mass games]] of the [[Arirang Festival]]. Officially, the stadium can seat 150,000 people, but the real capacity is under 114,000. Even the lower actual capacity ranks first on the [[List of stadiums by capacity|list of largest stadiums by capacity in the world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-lineups.com/stadium/460/|title=Rungrado 1st of May Stadium – Football Stadium|work=Football-Lineups|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Its scalloped roof features 16 [[arch]]es arranged in a ring, and resembles a [[magnolia]] blossom.

It hosts events on a main pitch sprawling across over 22,500&amp;nbsp;m² (242,200&amp;nbsp;ft²). Its total floor space is over 207,000&amp;nbsp;m² (2.2 million&amp;nbsp;ft²) across eight stories, and the lobes of its roof peak at more than 60&amp;nbsp;m (197&amp;nbsp;ft) from the ground.

==History==
After the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] had been awarded to [[Seoul]], North Korea doubled down its efforts to present itself as the legitimate Korean state. As part of these efforts, it successfully bid to organize the [[13th World Festival of Youth and Students]] in Pyongyang in 1989. Massive construction projects were initiated in preparation for the festival, one of which was the Rungrado 1st of May Stadium. At the time of completion, it was the largest stadium ever built in Asia.&lt;ref name="Cha2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cha|first=Victor|title=The Impossible State: North Korea, Past and Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AShswwfIbqsC&amp;pg=PA120|year=2012|publisher=Random House|location=London|isbn=978-1-4481-3958-3|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the stadium is used for sporting events, it is most famous as the site of massive performances and shows celebrating [[Kim Il-sung]] and the North Korean nation. In June–July 2002 it was the site of a large choreographed "[[Arirang Festival]]" gymnastic and artistic performance. The extravaganza involved for the first time some 100,000+ participants—double the number of spectators,&lt;ref name="guardian20020517"&gt;{{cite news|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/korea/article/0,2763,717149,00.html|title=Despair, hunger and defiance at the heart of the greatest show on earth|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 May 2002 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was open to foreigners. These performances are now an annual feature in Pyongyang, usually in August and September. The event in 2007 was recognized by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as the largest gymnastic display with 100,090 participants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-gymnastic-display&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, a number of North Korean army generals implicated in an assassination attempt on [[Kim Jong-il]] were [[death by burning|executed via burning]] in the stadium.&lt;ref name="telegraph20040613"&gt;{{cite news |title=Train blast was 'a plot to kill North Korea's leader' |first=Sergey |last=Soukhorukov |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/1464413/Train-blast-was-a-plot-to-kill-North-Koreas-leader.html |date=13 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Kim Jong-il entertained [[Madeleine Albright]], the [[United States Secretary of State]] under President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Kim her next challenge?|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/ML06Dg01.html|work=Asia Times Online|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Collision in Korea]]'' was the largest [[professional wrestling]] pay-per-view event ever that was jointly produced by [[World Championship Wrestling]] and [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]]. It took place over a period of two days on April 28 and 29, 1995 at the stadium and had an attendance of 150,000 and 190,000 according to local authorities. It did not air in North America until August 4, 1995. American wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer has claimed that the actual combined attendance for the two-day-event was somewhere around 160,000 total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/wwe/16-ppvs-not-on-the-wwe-network?page=5 |title=16 PPVs NOT On The WWE Network – Page 5 |publisher=Whatculture.com |date=2014-07-17 |accessdate=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a two-year renovation project, the stadium reopened in 2015.

In July 2017, the Rungnado Stadium played host to six group stage matches as part of [[2018 AFC U-23 Championship qualification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schedule &amp; Results|url=http://www.the-afc.com/afcasfeeds?view=all&amp;id=202&amp;type=Stage#ui-tabs-1|website=Asian Football Confederation|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[September 2018 inter-Korean summit]] in Pyeongyang, President [[Moon Jae-in]] of South Korea gave a speech with Chairman [[Kim Jong-un]] to 150,000 North Korean spectators. The speech has themes of unification, peace, and cooperation. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJod7qg2GCc&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Parc del Segre.jpg|thumb|The flatwater canal at the Parc del Segre and the Cadí mountain in the background]]

'''Parc Olímpic del Segre''' is a canoeing and kayaking facility in [[La Seu d'Urgell]], [[Catalonia]], Spain, built in 1990 for use during the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parcolimpic.cat/?set_language=en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1992/1992s2.pdf 1992 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 2. pp. 327-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition whitewater course is 300 m long, with a 6.5 m drop, making a 2.2% slope of 114&amp;nbsp;ft/mile or 22 m/km.   The natural flow of the Segre River is diverted through the course by a diversion dam upstream.  In low flow conditions, four 300-kilowatt recirculation pumps can add up to 12 m³/s to the course flow, in order to increase it to the course maximum of 17.5 m³/s.   When the course is not being used, or when the natural flow exceeds 17.5 m³/s, the pumps are reversed and run in turbine mode to generate electricity for the town.  

A 130-metre beginners course is a diversion from the main course.  Its drop is 1.5 m for a 1.2% slope of 61&amp;nbsp;ft/mile or 12 m/km.  Streamflow for the beginners course is 3 to 10 m³/s.

The park also has a 650-m long feedwater canal which carries water from the river into the whitewater course.  This canal is used for flatwater canoe and kayak training and competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://canoeslalomseu.parcolimpic.cat/&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships]] have been held at the venue twice, first in [[1999 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships|1999]] and then in [[2009 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships|2009]].

'''Stetson Bowl''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Surrey, British Columbia]], [[Canada]] built in 1948. Located in the [[Cloverdale Fairgrounds]], it was upgraded for minor league [[baseball]] and was the home field of the [[Surrey Glaciers]] of the [[Western Baseball League]] for the 1995 season. As a ballpark, the Stetson Bowl had a capacity of 5,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballparkreviews.com/surrey/surrey.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, it is the main venue of the [[Cloverdale Rodeo and Country Fair]]. "The Stetson Bowl Stadium is home to most of the Cloverdale Rodeo performances each year. Its total area is around {{convert|36400|sqft|m2|-1}} and its performance surface is made of sand. The bleachers can hold 4000 spectators and portable seating can accommodate 800 additional spectators. Besides the rodeo, the stadium is commonly used for filming, festivals, concerts, sporting events and dog training classes." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cloverdalerodeo.com/files/stetson-bowl.php Stetson Bowl at Cloverdale Rodeo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Surrey school board was petitioned by a local trustee in 2008 who argued that the Stetson Bowl should be used for more than a livestock and showdog display area.  The petition seeks to transform The Stetson Bowl to more of a human sports stadium, so it could "be revitalized
and used more effectively for community and school sporting activities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sd36.bc.ca/Board/meetings/0809/20080925stetsonbowl.pdf Surrey School district petitioned to investigate changes to Stetson bowl]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Terry Park Ballfield''' (also known as the '''Park T. Pigott Memorial Stadium''') is a historic site in [[Fort Myers, Florida]], United States. The park is named after the family that donated the land in the 1920s. For years the stadium has hosted [[Major League Baseball]] [[spring training]] as well as a dozen years of Florida State League baseball. The stadium has hosted the [[Philadelphia Athletics]], [[Cleveland Indians]], [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[Kansas City Royals]] spring training needs throughout the years. Terry Park was also home to some early [[minor league baseball]] most notable being the [[Fort Myers Palms]] and [[Fort Myers Royals]], both belonging to the [[Florida State League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/shoeless1920/TerryPark.html|title=Terry Park|author=|date=26 October 2009|website=archive.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026211545/http://www.geocities.com/shoeless1920/TerryPark.html|archivedate=26 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major League Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Babe Ruth]], [[Ty Cobb]], [[Roberto Clemente]], [[Jimmy Foxx]], [[Bob Feller]], [[Tris Speaker]] and [[George Brett]] are some of the notable players that have played at Terry Park Field.

== History ==
In {{baseball year|1921}} the Terry Family, a local Fort Myers family, donated approximately {{convert|25|acre|m2}} of cow pasture to [[Lee County, Florida|Lee County]]. Amidst nothing but bulls and heifers, a small wooden grandstand, seating no more than 600 fans, was erected on the site about a mile east of downtown Fort Myers. The stadium was built as a spring training ballpark for [[Connie Mack]]'s [[Philadelphia Athletics]] in {{baseball year|1925}}. The park was the spring training home of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] from 1925 until {{baseball year|1936}} and the [[Cleveland Indians]] from {{baseball year|1941}} until {{baseball year|1942}}.  It was also the home of the minor league [[Fort Myers Palms]] that operated there in 1926. The stadium remained in its 1925 condition, until 1943 when it was destroyed in a fire.  However, in 1955 the park was rebuilt. This time, instead of wood, the stadium was made from steel and concrete.

==Pittsburgh Pirates era==
The rebuilt Terry Park created an alliance between Fort Myers and the Pittsburgh Pirates. For years the Pirates wandered all over the country for a spring training location and were looking for a permanent spring training home. During a 12-year period the Pirates spent spring training in 7 different locations: [[McCulloch Park (Muncie, Indiana)|McCulloch Park]] in [[Muncie, Indiana]]; [[Flamingo Park]] in [[Miami Beach]], [[Gilmore Field]] in [[Hollywood, California]]; [[Perris Hill Park]] in [[San Bernardino]]; [[Estadio Latinoamericano|Gran Stadium]] in [[Havana, Cuba]]; and [[Jaycee Park]] in [[Fort Pierce, Florida]]. Terry Park became their spring training home for the next 14 years, before moving to [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton's]] [[McKechnie Field]] in {{baseball year|1969}}.

== Kansas City Royals era ==
In 1968 the [[Kansas City Athletics]] moved from [[Kansas City, Missouri]] to [[Oakland, California]].  This allowed for Kansas City to receive a Major League expansion team. They received their team which was called the [[Kansas City Royals]]. Terry Field became the new spring training home for the team. The team's historic first exhibition game was played at Terry Field. The Royals would remain in Fort Myers until {{baseball year|1987}}. During the [[Kansas City Royals]] years, the field featured artificial turf, similar to that of [[Royals Stadium]]. However several years after the Royals left for Baseball City, the turf left as well.

In {{baseball year|1988}} the Royals left Fort Myers for [[Haines City, Florida]]. The City open offered the team a new [[Baseball City Stadium|stadium]] and opened up a [[theme park]] called [[Boardwalk and Baseball]] that was centered on a baseball theme. 
The main attraction was going to be the [[Kansas City Royals]] spring training home. However the deal later proved to be a bust and by 2002 the park was abandoned and later demolished.

===Fort Myers Royals===
In {{baseball year|1978}} the Kansas City Royals brought a minor league affiliate to Fort Myers, the team was called the [[Fort Myers Royals]] and they were a Single A [[Florida State League]] franchise. The team played at Terry Field from 1978 until 1987. In 1985 the Royals won the Florida League Championship. [[Kevin Seitzer]] and [[Bret Saberhagen]] were members of the Fort Myers team and began their professional careers at Terry Park.

==End of professional baseball==
After the Royals left Fort Myers, a new spring training team was never fielded at the stadium. Two new stadiums were built in Fort Myers, [[Hammond Stadium]] was built for the [[Minnesota Twins]] and [[City of Palms Park]] was built for the [[Boston Red Sox]]. The last professional baseball team to call Terry Park home was the [[Fort Myers Sun Sox]] of the short lived [[Senior Professional Baseball Association]] in 1989 and 1990. The league featured former [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] stars and was played during the winter months. The league folded in 1990. All SPBA playoff games were held at Terry Park, since the league's playoffs occurred during spring training.

== National Register of Historic Places ==
The park pretty much still remained in its 1955 condition. On May 11, 1995 the ball field was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] by the [[United States Department of the Interior]]. The memorial stadium was dedicated to area resident, Park T. Pigott (1914–1972), in recognition of his lifetime of service, through sports, to the youth of this community. For the 2003 season Terry Park was used by the Golden Eagles of [[Florida Gulf Coast University]] while their new ballpark is being built at their Fort Myers campus.

== Hurricane damage ==
In 2004, the stadium was hit by [[Hurricane Charley]]. The damage from the storm caused the grandstand to be labeled "unsafe". 
Later in the year, The Board of Lee County Commissioners approved a guaranteed maximum price of $701,697 for Compass Construction to tear down the old grandstand and build a new one. But instead of rebuilding the historic 5,000 seat grandstand, the city replaced it with a small 700 seat structure. This was despite the fact that the park was given an official historic marker in 1995. Technically once a grandstand is demolished, the basepark loses all of its historic significance, regardless of whether it is the same field. Only the old girders have been retained as the outline for a new grandstand that opened in 2005. So what stands at Terry Park now bears little resemblance to the Spring training location it once was. While the new grandstand is covered, it is much smaller and made of metal. Many residents feel that it was unfortunate that the county decided not to try to save the classic grandstand. 2006 marked the centennial anniversary of Terry Park – at least the playing field portion of it. The new stadium currently seats about 900 people, as the additional bleachers down the foul lines have been removed. A spring training museum is also being considered for the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ballparkreviews.com/fmyers/terry.htm|title=Terry Park - Fort Myers, Florida|first=Brian|last=Merzbach|date=|website=www.ballparkreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
Today, over 160 college baseball teams from around the country use Terry Park in the month of March to begin their college season. The park is currently part of a multi-diamond facility serving various amateur levels of baseball. The facility now sees year-round amateur baseball use. This property is part of the [[List of Registered Historic Buildings in Lee County, Florida|Lee County Multiple Property Submission]], a Multiple Property Submission to the National Register.  Terry Park is used year-round for baseball leagues, tournaments and special events. The facility has four lighted fields with spectator seating including a covered grandstand on the main field. The park is also equipped with batting cages near each field. Terry Park is currently being remodeled with new restrooms, concession area, press box and seating areas. The work will be done in phases to allow the park to operate as close to normal as possible.

'''Vaughn Street Park''' was a [[baseball]] [[Baseball park|park]] in the [[Pacific Northwest|northwest]] United States, located in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Opened in 1901, it lasted for over a half century and was torn down in 1956. Its primary tenant was the [[Portland Beavers]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]]. During a stretch when the club was tagged as the "Lucky Beavers", the ballpark was also sometimes called '''Lucky Beavers Stadium'''.

The site, in the [[Slabtown, Portland, Oregon|Slabtown area]], is presently an industrial property with no traces of the stadium, except for a plaque.

== History ==
Built {{Years or months ago|1901}} in 1901, it was financed by E. I. Fuller and C. F. Swigert, two owners of [[tram|trolley]] lines that ran nearby. The ballpark was on a block bounded by Northwest Vaughn Street on the south (third base), Northwest 24th Avenue on the east (first base), and Northwest 25th Avenue on the west (left to center field). The field had an unorthodox northwest alignment ([[home plate]] near the southeast corner), at an approximate [[elevation]] of {{convert|70|ft|round=5|spell=in}} above [[sea level]].

The two financiers hoped to profit from [[professional baseball]], both at the box office and via fares from their trolley lines. In 1896, Portland's former professional baseball team had folded; a new team, the [[Portland Webfoots]], debuted in 1901. This team would go on to win the [[Pacific Northwest League]] title that year. The following year, the league merged with the [[California League#History|California League]] to become the [[Pacific Coast League]]; the Webfooters, after several name change, settled on the name [[Portland Beavers]].

Initially, the stadium had a single 3,000-seat grandstand behind home plate; seating was expanded to 6,000 seats in 1905.  That year, Portland hosted the [[Lewis &amp; Clark Centennial Exposition]], and the stadium was used for the National Track and Field championships, held concurrently.  During that event, baseball was temporarily played on the grounds of the Portland Athletic Club (later the [[Multnomah Athletic Club]]), on a field that is now the site of [[Providence Park]].  With the construction of additional seating in 1912, Vaughn Street Park's capacity grew to 12,000 spectators.

=== 1920s–'30s ===

In 1926, the stadium received its first serious local competition when the larger and more modern [[Multnomah Stadium]] (now Providence Park) opened approximately {{convert|2|mi|0|spell=in}} to the south.  It was expected that the baseball team, now christened the Beavers, would move to the newer stadium, but the team elected to stay at Vaughn Street.  Multnomah Stadium was instead used for other sporting events, including [[college football]] and [[greyhound racing]].

Vaughn Street Park occasionally hosted other events besides baseball; several [[boxing|prizefights]] were held there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=011349&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the notable players to play at Vaughn Street, either for the home team or for the visitors, are [[Satchel Paige]], [[Joe Tinker]], [[Jim Thorpe]], and [[Ted Williams]].

=== 1940s–'50s===

The stadium also became, however briefly, the home of the [[Portland Rosebuds (baseball)|Portland Rosebuds]], a team owned by [[Athletics at the 1936 Summer Olympics|Olympic gold medalist]] {{nowrap|[[Jesse Owens]].&lt;ref name="oba2005"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/west-coast-baseball-association-tf/ | title= West Coast Baseball Association | work= Organizing Black America: An Encyclopedia of African American Associations |date= 2005-02-10| publisher=[[BookRags]] | accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Rosebuds were part of the [[West Coast Baseball Association]], an [[Negro Leagues|all-black league]] headed by [[Abe Saperstein]], the owner of the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]; the league was disbanded after only two months.&lt;ref name="oba2005"/&gt;

In 1947, the center field bleachers burned in an early morning fire on September 21, blamed on a smoldering {{nowrap|cigarette;&lt;ref name=fdpst&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rnhWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UeUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1619%2C2487146 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington|agency=Associated Press |title=Fire destroys Portland seats|date=September 22, 1947 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbsraz&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XeNYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mfUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4786%2C2412681 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington|agency=Associated Press |title=Baseball stands razed by blaze|date=September 22, 1947 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} the stadium had recently been condemned by fire {{nowrap|inspectors.&lt;ref name=bvstdbf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Qoo1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uR8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1479%2C2740546 |work=Bend Bulletin |location=Oregon |agency=United Press |title=Beaver stands damaged by fire |date=September 22, 1947 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pomc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xY8RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hugDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1915%2C420613 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=Oregon |agency=Associated Press |title=Portland officials may close Vaughn St. after Sunday's fire |date=September 23, 1947 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The center field bleachers were rebuilt, smaller than their predecessor and disconnected from the left field bleachers.

In 1955, the stadium was bought by new owners, who later announced that they would tear it down; the Beavers moved to [[Multnomah Stadium]] in 1956.  The stadium was razed that same year. The grass field from Vaughn Street was transplanted to Multnomah Stadium; thirteen years later in 1969, [[artificial turf]] was installed.

'''Wills Gymnasium''', often referred to as '''Wills Gym''', was a multi-purpose athletic facility on the campus of [[Kent State University]] in [[Kent, Ohio]], United States. Construction started in 1924 and the building was dedicated in 1925. It was the first dedicated gymnasium on the KSU campus, which had opened in 1913. Before the opening of Wills Gym, physical education classes and the intercollegiate and intramural sports teams used a variety of spaces for games and classes, both on campus in other buildings and off campus. The main gym seated approximately 4,000 people and the basement level included an indoor pool, locker rooms, and bowling alley. At the time, its capacity made it one of the largest facilities in the region. The building served as the primary home of the university's athletic teams and physical education department until 1950, when the [[Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center|Men's Physical Education Building]] opened. Wills Gym was the first permanent home of the [[Kent State Golden Flashes men's basketball]] team, and was also the original home venue for wrestling, men's swimming, men's and women's gymnastics, women's volleyball, and [[Kent State Golden Flashes women's basketball|women's basketball]].

Even after being replaced as the primary athletic venue and physical education facility, Wills Gym continued to be used as the home venue for men's gymnastics, later joined by women's gymnastics in 1959, and women's volleyball and basketball in 1975. It was also used for women's physical education, intramural sports, class registration, and other activities for nearly 30 years. By the 1970s, structural and maintenance issues along with the passage and implementation of [[Title IX]] resulted in plans to build a replacement for Wills. Women's basketball and volleyball left Wills after their respective 1977 seasons and moved to [[Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center|Memorial Gym]], while both gymnastics teams played part of their home schedules at Wills until 1979. The building was condemned by the state of Ohio in the mid 1970s. Physical education classes and offices were moved to the new Memorial Gym Annex, completed in mid-1979. In August 1979, the gymnasium and pool were razed, though the portion of the building which had housed the physical education offices remained as Wills Hall and housed the [[Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC) program from 1983–2000. A parking lot was built on the site of the gym and pool. In the early 2000s, Wills Hall was torn down and replaced with a lobby area as part of the renovation of the adjacent University Auditorium, which was renamed Cartwright Hall in 2006.

==History==
[[File:Wills Gym interior 1934.jpg|thumbnail|left|Interior of the playing floor in 1934 showing windows and skylight]]
A gymnasium was part of the original plans for the Kent State Normal School and plans were presented to the Ohio State Legislature in 1916 for its construction along with a heating plant and additional dormitory. The allocation of funds for the gym, however, was not approved until 1923 due to [[World War I]]. In the meantime, physical education, intramural, and intercollegiate sports used a variety of other spaces. Early basketball games were held in various locations, such as the atrium of the original [[Ohio State Normal College at Kent|Administration Building]] (known as Cartwright Hall since 2006), in the basement of the original heating plant, in the local Congregational Church gymnasium, and at [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (Kent, Ohio)#First campus, 1922–1959|Theodore Roosevelt High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://einside.kent.edu/?type=art&amp;id=267|title= Extensive Improvements Made to University Auditorium|accessdate=January 24, 2015 |author= Sopko, Jen|year=2002 |work= eInside|publisher= Kent State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Normal College Basket Ball |date=November 1915 |newspaper=[[Record-Courier (Ohio)|Kent Courier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chestnut Burr |year=1923 |url=http://www.library.kent.edu/burr/1923 |publisher=[[Kent State University]] Special Collections and Archives |page=96 |accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chestnut Burr |year=1925 |url=http://www.library.kent.edu/burr/1925 |publisher=[[Kent State University]] Special Collections and Archives |page=161 |accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site chosen for the gym was a swampy area known as Blackbird Lake, located directly behind the original Administration Building, which had been completed in 1914. Construction started on Wills Gym in 1924 and it was dedicated May 16, 1925. Initially, it was simply called "the Gymnasium" before being named for David C. Wills, who was chairman of the Kent State Board of Trustees at the time. Built as an annex to the Administration Building, the facility featured the main gymnasium, which had a balcony with seating for 650 people and an overall capacity of approximately 4,000. In the basement were shower areas, a six-lane swimming pool, and a six-lane bowling alley. Offices for the new Physical Education Department—which had been mandated by the state of Ohio a year earlier—and [[Kent State Golden Flashes|Intercollegiate Athletics]] were located on the first floor.

Wills Gym was hailed as "one of finest gymnasiums in Ohio" by the school's 1927 yearbook, ''The Chestnut Burr'', adding that teams who traveled to Kent for basketball or football games always wanted to see the gym. The first men's basketball game at Wills Gym was a 37–24 loss to [[Mount Union College]] on January 5, 1926 to open the 1925–26 season. A varsity wrestling team began play in 1928, followed by men's gymnastics in 1930, and men's swimming in 1936.  The gym was also a frequent site for high school games and tournaments, and served as the home court for the [[Kent State University School|Kent State High School]] Blue Devils until 1956.

Following [[World War II]], a large increase in the number of male students led to the expansion of the school, and of the athletic and physical education departments in particular, which included construction of a new [[Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center|Men's Physical Education Building]]. The new gym was completed in 1950 with seating for 7,000 and could hold as many as 10,000. It replaced Wills Gym as the home of men's physical education and as the venue for the men's basketball, swimming, and wrestling teams. The final men's basketball game at Wills was a 68–47 win over the [[Case Western Reserve University#Athletics|Western Reserve Red Cats]] on March 7, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Flashes 68-47 Victors In Gym Finale |url=http://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=tks19500308-01# |author=Stuart, Bob |work=Daily Kent Stater |page=3 |date=March 8, 1950 |accessdate=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men's gymnastics continued to use Wills Gymnasium as their home venue and were joined by the women's gymnastics team in 1959, the first women's collegiate gymnastics team in the United States. The 1972 passage of [[Title IX]] led to the establishment of intercollegiate women's volleyball and women's basketball teams in 1975, with home games at Wills Gym. In addition to equal playing opportunities for female athletes, however, Title IX also required equal facilities for both men and women and the facilities at Wills were not only older and in deteriorating condition, but were considerably smaller than those at the Memorial Gym as the seating capacity at Wills Gym had been reduced to near 100 by the mid 1970s. Both women's teams initially played all or most of their schedule at Wills for their first few seasons before permanently moving to Memorial Gym for the 1977–78 seasons. The men's and women's gymnastics teams continued to have home meets at both Memorial and Wills through the 1979 season. The final gymnastics meet at Wills was the women's team's 150th win all-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Women gymnasts capture 150th win |url=http://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19790216-01.2.46&amp;srpos=40&amp;e=------197-en-20--21--txt-txIN-%22Wills+Gym%22+----1979--# |author=Goldman, Judy |date=February 16, 1979 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |page=16 |accessdate=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1970, most of the seats in the balcony were removed and the area was used to create classroom and office space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wills Gym goes under the 'knife' |url=http://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19700116-01.2.27&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-Wills+Gym+balcony+classroom------# |date=January 16, 1970 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |page=9 |accessdate=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, structural and maintenance problems were evident and frequent, which may have been caused by the original swampy site. The building was closed and declared "unsafe" in March 1973, and while repairs were made to allow continued use of the gym, the building was not fully renovated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wills Gym declared ‘unsafe’ |url=http://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19730328-01.2.2&amp;srpos=12&amp;e=------197-en-20--1--txt-txIN-%22Wills+Gym%22-ILLUSTRATION-----# |author=Temkiewicz, Jan |date=March 28, 1973 |page=1 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |accessdate=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wills repairs bids to open |url=http://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19730426-01.2.3&amp;srpos=2&amp;e=------197-en-20--1--txt-txIN-%22Wills+Gym%22+structural-ILLUSTRATION-----# |author=Wolfersberger, Carol |date=April 26, 1973 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |page=1 |accessdate=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 1979, just prior to the closure of the building, a large section of ceiling plaster above the pool collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wills' ceiling collapses; pool area is 'off limits' |url=http://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=ksn19790628-01.2.6&amp;srpos=20&amp;e=------197-en-20--1--txt-txIN-%22Wills+Gym%22+----1979--# |author=Mililli, Denise |date=June 28, 1979 |newspaper=Kent State University Summer News |accessdate=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offices and activities began moving to the new Memorial Gym Annex (now known as the MACC Annex) in mid July 1979 and demolition on Wills Gym began in early August 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gym annex limited use planned to start Monday |url=http://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=ksn19790719-01.2.10&amp;srpos=5&amp;e=------197-en-20--1-byDA-txt-txIN-%22Wills+Gym%22+annex------ |author=Krause, Ken |date=July 19, 1979 |newspaper=Kent State University Summer News |accessdate=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former offices of the physical education department remained after the demolition, known as Wills Hall, and served as the home of the Kent State chapter of the [[Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC) from 1983–2000. Wills Hall was razed in 2000 as part of a renovation and expansion to adjacent Cartwright Hall, then known as the Auditorium Building.

===Other uses===
In addition to physical education and intercollegiate and intramural athletics, Wills Gym hosted class registration for many years, and was also used for dances and other large social events, such as those related to homecoming. In 1940, Wills Gym was the site of the final game of the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] championship, between the [[Akron Firestone Non-Skids]] and [[Oshkosh All-Stars]], won by Firestone 61–60. The game was moved to Kent from the Firestone gym in [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] because Wills Gym had a larger seating capacity than other facilities in the area at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The National Basketball League: A History, 1935-1949 |authorlink1=Murry R. Nelson |author=Nelson, Murry R. |year=2009 |isbn=9780786440061 |publisher=McFarland and Company |pages=78, 276}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s, Wills was used for a high school basketball tournament featuring the rural schools of [[Portage County, Ohio|Portage County]]. The gym was also a regular site for Ohio high school sectional and district tournament games for both size classifications at the time, Class A and Class B, with some Class A games drawing capacity crowds in excess of 4,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dedication Ceremonies Set |author=Wolcott, Oliver |newspaper=[[Record-Courier (Ohio)|Record-Courier]] |date=November 28, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Wills Gym interior 1930.png|thumbnail|left|Interior view in 1930 during a physical education class. Balcony seats, windows, and lower-level bleacher seating can be seen in the background.]]
The exterior facade of Wills Gym was brick with embedded columns and rectangular windows, similar to the adjacent Cartwright, Kent, and Merrill Halls, all of which were designed in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style, prominent in the early 20th century. Total space was {{convert|51676|sqft}} with {{convert|37694|sqft}} listed as "assignable space".&lt;ref name=campus&gt;{{cite book |title=Campus Buildings, 008 Wills Gymnasium |publisher=Kent State University |year=1969 |pages=PS 0828–0828-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior was divided into three levels, with two levels above ground and the lower level just below ground. The main gymnasium occupied most of the upper two levels on one side. It featured large windows on three sides, and originally had a large skylight in the center over the gym floor. Three double doorways were located on the sideline opposite the balcony, which led to short staircases with access to the parking lot. On the fourth side on the upper level was the balcony section, which had fixed chairback seating and smaller windows on all three exterior walls near the ceiling. In 1970, the seating and tiers in the balcony were removed and the area was largely converted into additional classroom space. The remainder of the seating in the gym was provided by bleacher seats, which were located around the playing floor. On the ground floor under the balcony section were offices and storage areas, including a mail room. For a time, the campus police department also and an office in Wills Gym. A corridor in the center of the level connected Wills Gym with the adjacent University Auditorium in what is now known as Cartwright Hall.&lt;ref name=campus/&gt;

The lower level mainly contained the pool and locker rooms, as well as the power and heating utilities rooms. When the building was dedicated in 1925, much of the basement was still unfinished. Originally, the lower level was a larger open space and also included a seating area adjacent to the pool and bowling alleys. The level was later subdivided into smaller rooms. There were windows on three sides of the basement level, but because it was mostly below ground, they were smaller and higher on the walls.&lt;ref name=campus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Program for the Dedication of the Gymnasium |publisher=Kent State Normal College |date=May 16, 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site==
[[File:Wills Gym site.JPG|thumbnail|Site of Wills Gymnasium in 2014, with the rear of [[Ohio State Normal College at Kent#Structures|Cartwright Hall]] in the center background]]
The area formerly occupied by Wills Gymnasium is mostly covered by a parking lot behind Cartwright Hall, which houses the 800-seat University Auditorium. The main lobby for the auditorium, built in 2002, is where Wills Hall stood and overlaps the northern end of Wills Gymnasium, over the part of the building that housed the physical education offices.

'''Windsor Park''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Roseau, Dominica]]. It serves as the national stadium and is used mostly for [[cricket]] matches. Other uses have included the [[World Creole Music Festival]], the Finals of the Calypso Competition and the Miss Dominica pageant.

The stadium is of [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) international standard with facilities featuring 12,000 seats, private boxes, a media centre, practice nets, a players'  personality complex, digital score boards and five cricket pitches.

==History==
The ground was named after [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], [[England]] and is situated on the eastern side of Roseau. It was levelled out of a rubbish dump previously known as Cow Town. It was a popular venue for sports of all kinds, carnival activities, [[horse racing|horse]] and [[donkey racing]], State parades and played a central role in island life. In 1999 a national stadium was planned for the site, but after demolishing all of the existing stands and adjoining buildings, including a former school that had once been wards of the Roseau Hospital, the project was abandoned and the site was deserted until 2005.

New work on the stadium started on 23 March 2005, on the first anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and Dominica. The stadium is one of the 'Four Pillar Projects' promised by the People's Republic of China to Dominica as a result of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) during the establishment of ties between Dominica and China. The stadium is viewed as a gift at a cost of [[EC$]]33 million, (US$17 million, €12 million), from the [[government of the People's Republic of China]] to the government and people of the Commonwealth of Dominica.

On 7 February 2007, work on the Windsor Park Stadium was completed. Work on the facilities to accompany the stadium resulted in the stadium not being used before May 2007, therefore missing any activities relating to Cricket World Cup 2007, held in the Caribbean. The handing-over ceremony of the stadium from Chinese officials to Dominica took place on 23 March, marking the third year of diplomatic ties with the [[People's Republic of China|People's Republic]]. On 24 October 2007 the Windsor Park National Sport Stadium was official opened with a grand ceremony. The 11th Annual World Creole Music Festival (WCMF) was held on 25–27 Oct. as the stadium's first official activity.

==Activities==
On 6 February 2008, the [[Dominica national football team]] played their first 2010 World Cup qualifying match against [[Barbados national football team|Barbados]] in front of 4,200 spectators at Windsor Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concacaf.com/view_article.asp?id=4091 Barbados tie Dominica] – CONCACAF.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominica hosted its first two [[One Day International]] cricket matches at Windsor Park Stadium, between [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] and [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]]. The games were played on 26 July and 28 July in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/401333.html Dominica to host ODIs in 2009] – Cricinfo.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dirt bike.jpeg|thumb]]
Motocross is an off road racing sport that is raced on a dirt bike around a track, there are multiple riders going around at a time and the first person to complete the required number of laps in the shortest period of time wins. The women's motocross league is separate from men's motocross because of the different rules, and also the different bike sizes. Women generally race bikes that are 125cc or 250cc because they are not big enough to ride a 450cc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = First Dirt Bike, MX, How to Choose, Women Riders|url = http://www.womenridersnow.com/pages/How_To_Choose_A_Dirt_Bike.aspx|website = www.womenridersnow.com|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences make it hard for men and women to compete together however it is done and is allowed. Women compete in the AMA races but rarely make it into the main event because their practice laps and heat laps are not fast enough. Women's professional motocross has the support of professional male riders also.

[[Motocross]] started in approximately 1924 over in Europe and spread very quickly to the United States due to immigration and the moving of families for job and freedom opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Motocross America: The History|url = http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/asp/museum/exhibits/mx/history.asp|website = www.motorcyclemuseum.org|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's professional motocross is an organized sports league where females can compete for money and prizes at the highest level of motocross. Women’s motocross began in Europe in the early 1950s and 1960s and moved to the United States in the middle of the 1960s. This was during the time that women’s equality movements were strong, helping the sport to grow. In 1971 Kerri Kleid was the first woman to receive a professional motocross rider license, which was revoked after it was discovered that she was a woman. When processing her license paperwork, the registry did not know that she was a female because there was no box that indicated this information. When she showed up at the first race in Unadilla, she was told that she could not race because she was a woman. Kerri then went to court and eventually won her license back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women’s MSC History {{!}} MSC HISTORY|url = http://history.mscmotocross.com/history/womens-msc-history/|website = history.mscmotocross.com|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was the first time in history when women understood that they could be professionals in the world of motocross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women's Motocross History -  History|url = http://www.womensmxhistory.com/history.php|website = www.womensmxhistory.com|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 the first Powder Puff National Championship took place which marked the first time that a specifically women’s National Championship was available for female motocross riders in the United States. The "Powder Puff" was a motocross event where women could race in heats in order to qualify for the main event, or the last race of the night with the chance to win the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women’s Motocross and the Powder Puff Years|url = http://motodude.com/2012/03/04/womens-motocross-and-the-powder-puff-years/|website = MotoDude  "Life on Two Wheels"|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 the event’s name was changed from the Powder Puff National Championship to the Women’s Motocross Nationals. The championship took place ever year consecutively from 1975 through today, although in 1982 and 1986 the races were not held. In 1996 the Women’s Motocross League (WML) was founded after the first Women’s Supercross Championships took place in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WSMX: Womens School of Motocross {{!}}   The Founding Females of MX: A History of Women &amp; Motocross|url = http://wsmxinc.com/archives/1340|website = wsmxinc.com|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this the WML was allowed to petition to be a part of the AMA Pro Motocross Championship, which included the men’s ranks and races. This led to the creation of the Women’s Motocross Association, which was founded in 2004 and sold to MX Sports, a large motocross corporation, in 2009. The selling of this allows for women’s motocross to remain a permanent part of men's motocross and the motocross industry. This also caused a change in the naming of WMA to WMX, so that it would fit in with the rest of the corporation. In order to keep women racing factory teams started to offer female riders contracts so that they could get the women to race their motorcycles. Factory teams are large corporations and the main companies that produce and distribute motorcycles. There are over 250 factory teams in the United States alone including the major ones Suzuki, Yamaha, Honda, KTM, and Kawasaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Buzz {{!}} 250 Teams For 2016 {{!}} Transworld Motocross|url = http://motocross.transworld.net/news/the-buzz-250-teams-for-2016/#XtPouhtOxVezXCBu.97|website = Transworld Motocross|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without these sponsorships and contracts it is nearly impossible for a person to support a professional race team on their own, the cost is too much.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women's Motocross: The Next Level - Motorcycle USA|url = http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2010/07/article/womens-motocross-the-next-level/|website = Motorcycle USA|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to receive a factory ride, the women had to prove that they were on top of the game and that they were willing to work hard and put the hours necessarily in to get better. The training that they endure goes beyond just riding their dirt bike, it happens in the gym and on pedal bikes as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Strength Training for Motocross (Principles) - Racer X Virtual Trainer|url = http://www.racerxvt.com/article/strength-training-for-motocross-principles|website = www.racerxvt.com|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These riders worked for the best bikes that money could buy, because if they did not they would be out of a job and also unable to support their racing. It costs over $200,000.00 a year for an elite motocross rider to be ready for the season. This includes having the best bike, the best trainers, spare parts, a way to get the bikes to the track, fuel costs and many more expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Supercross FAQs - Racer X Online|url = http://racerxonline.com/2008/08/25/supercross-faqs|website = Supercross FAQs - Racer X Online|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
Women's motocross is full of people who have a no quit mentality and are often heard saying things like " I won't quit until I am physically unable to ride". These mentalities are what keeps the sport alive and well, without them it would have died long ago. Women's motocross is a sport that requires dedication and constant work, so the people who are involved in it, both the riders and the teams, have to be mentally strong.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wyoming Scholars Repository - Undergraduate Research Day: A Tale of Dirt and Dedication: An Ethnography of Motocross Culture|url = http://repository.uwyo.edu/ugrd/2014_UGRD/Schedule/12/|website = repository.uwyo.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make this sport a success women had to put in hard work and be mentally strong, they heard the word no more times than most but kept going. Having a strong mentality is what allows women's sports at the professional level to be a success. Much like the male counterpart, professional women's racing requires hours of training in order to be on top. This league is full of only the best riders and the most successful women, so without the mental aspect, these women would not be able to compete in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental toughness in sport: Achievement level, gender, age, experience, and sport type differences|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886909000750|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|date = 2009-07-01|pages = 73–75|volume = 47|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2009.02.006|first = Adam R.|last = Nicholls|first2 = Remco C.

== Most Influential Female Rider ==
There rider who stands out of the pack when talking about women's motocross is Ashley Fiolek, she has the ability to go above and beyond the normal realm of what is expected of the female rider. She also is able to set race and lap times that can compete with the highest-level male riders which is uncommon for not only motocross but most sports. Men typically have the upper hand due to physical attribute that cause them to be stronger and faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Genetic factors in physical activity levels: A twin study|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379702004786||accessdate = 2015-11-23|doi=10.1016/S0749-3797(02)00478-6|volume=23|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|pages=87–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this rider is able to keep up with the best of both genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.michaelmessner.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ssj88.pdf|title = Sports and Male Domination: The Female Athlete as Contested Ideological Terrain|last = Messner|first = Michael|date = 1988|journal = Sociology of Sport Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the fastest female on the track and knows it, with a confidence that most women dream of having she takes each lap for what it is and has a level head that allows her to keep pushing and progressing.&lt;ref name="Ashley Fiolek {{!}} New Chapters"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ashley Fiolek {{!}} New Chapters|url = http://motocross.transworld.net/features/ashley-fiolek-new-chapters/#ogEzWyvg5Fw7T80p.97|website = Transworld Motocross|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ashley Fiolek ===
[[Ashley Fiolek]], a native of [[Dearborn Michigan]], born on October 22, 1990 is the most accomplished rider of this generation, she has won more amateur and professional races than anyone else in her age group and has stayed on top for the longest period of time.  She was born deaf which is one of the most important reasons for why she starting racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women's professional motocross faces uphill battle for legitimacy|url = http://xgames.espn.go.com/xgames/rally-moto-x/article/10893795/women-professional-motocross-faces-uphill-battle-legitimacy|website = X Games|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Ashley was unable to hear and participate easily in team sports, she picked up riding due to the fact that she could do it by herself and not have to talk or hear anything other than the bike. Being deaf served as one of her greatest advantages while racing because she could not hear what was going on outside the track, she only had to focus on what she was doing which allowed her to dial in and focus at a level that most other riders are unable to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ProMotocross.com - Ashley Fiolek|url = http://www.promotocross.com/mx/athlete/ashley-fiolek|website = www.promotocross.com|accessdate = 2015-11-09|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is able to get on the track and block everything else out other than the things that she is focusing on, such as jumping, cornering, and passing the competitors. Ashley started racing dirt bikes when she was just 7 years old, and has been racing ever since. Fiolek is a factory rider for team Honda, who she has been signed with ever since she was young. They give her the support that she needs in order to run the cleanest and most successful bike on the track. Through their sponsorship, Ashely is able to ride one of the best bikes available. At the young age of 21 Fiolek walked away from racing in the pros due to the impossible contracts and because the sport that she loved was taking a turn that she did not want to continue on with.&lt;ref name="Ashley Fiolek {{!}} New Chapters"/&gt; Ashley now trains younger riders to be the best racers that they can. Though there are other influential riders in women's motocross, none hold the same list of accomplishments that Ashley does.

The '''XFL Draft''' was the only draft for the single-season [[XFL]] football league. The [[draft (sports)|draft]] took place over a 3 day time period from October 28, 2000 to October 30, 2000 during which time a total of 475 players were selected by the league's 8 teams from a pool of approximately 1,600 or so eligible players. The draft consisted of 59 rounds—10 rounds taking place on October 28, 15 rounds on October 29, and 34 rounds on October 30.

The draft was followed by a supplemental draft on December 29, 2000 during which 65 additional players were selected in an effort to completely fill out team rosters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2000/2000_12_29.jsp |title=WWE Corporate - XFL Holds First Supplemental Draft; Eight Teams Choose 65 Players |publisher=Corporate.wwe.com |date=2000-12-29 |accessdate=2012-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313012731/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2000/2000_12_29.jsp |archivedate=March 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most eligible players came from either the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]], the [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|Arena Football League]], [[NFL Europe]], retired [[NFL]] players, or previous college players who had gone undrafted by the [[NFL]] but had not yet signed with another league.

The XFL draft took place in order for teams to be ready to begin league play when the season kicked off on February 3, 2001.

== Notable players drafted ==
{{See also|XFL#Notable_players}}
Many of the players selected in the XFL draft went on to compete in the NFL and other football leagues.

Notable players selected in the draft included future league [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] and Los Angeles quarterback [[Tommy Maddox]], who signed with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] after the XFL eventually folded. Maddox later became the starting quarterback for the Steelers, and led them to the playoffs. Los Angeles used the first pick in the draft to select another future NFL quarterback, Scott Milanovich. Milanovich lost the starting quarterback job to Maddox, who was placed on the Xtreme as one of a handful of players put on each team due to geographic distance between the player's college and the team's hometown. Another of the eventually better-known players who was selected in the draft was Las Vegas [[running back]] [[Rod Smart]], who first gained popularity because the name on the back of his jersey read "''[[Rod Smart#"He Hate Me"|He Hate Me]].''"  Smart stated that he had wanted to put "'''''They''' Hate Me''" (a jab at his critics) but there wasn't enough room.  Smart, who was only picked 357th in the draft, later went on to play for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Carolina Panthers]], and the [[Oakland Raiders]], thus becoming the second XFL player (after receiver [[Yo Murphy]] did as a member of the [[St. Louis Rams]] in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomurphy.com/facts.htm |title=Pro Experience |publisher=YoMurphy.com |accessdate=July 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021206214806/http://www.yomurphy.com/facts.htm |archivedate=December 6, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to play in a [[Super Bowl]], participating in [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], which his team lost. His Panther teammate [[Jake Delhomme]] named his new-born horse "She Hate Me" as a reference to Smart. Maddox became the third former XFL player to play for a Super Bowl team ([[Pittsburgh Steelers]]), in [[Super Bowl XL]] in [[Detroit]], and he was the first to win a Super Bowl ring, although Maddox did not play in the game.

Many other XFL "alumni" who were selected in the draft went on to play in the NFL, including [[Kevin Kaesviharn]], [[Jose Cortez]], [[Corey Ivy]], [[Mike Furrey]] and [[Rod Smart]], and many others played extensively in the CFL, including [[Kelvin Anderson]], [[John Avery (football player)|John Avery]], [[Duane Butler]], [[Jeremaine Copeland]], [[Marcus Crandell]], [[Reggie Durden]], [[Eric England (gridiron football)|Eric England]], [[Paul McCallum (Canadian football)|Paul McCallum]] (who wore the jersey nickname "CFL Reject"), [[Yo Murphy]], [[Noel Prefontaine]] and [[Bobby Singh]]. The [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|Arena Football League]] also absorbed some former XFL players.
