'''Amode Ibrahim Atchia''' (1868 – 17 September 1947), otherwise known as '''Major Atchia''', was an [[entrepreneur]] and technologist in the [[Indian Ocean Islands]] who pioneered the use of scientific concepts and invented structural and mechanical advances in technology for the nationbuilding of [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dukhira|first=Chit|title=The genuis &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;: Amode Ibrahim Atchia, (1868-1947)|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/article/genuis-amode-ibrahim-atchia-1868-1947|publisher=lexpess.mu.online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Rose-Belle]], in [[Grand Port district]], AIA was the son of a [[Surti Muslims]] merchant called Ibrahim Sulleman Atchia who had arrived from [[Barbodhan]], a village 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Surat]], in [[Gujarat]] state of [[India]] in the course of free trade. Despite little formal education, Amode Ibrahim Atchia, along with his three brothers, set about making unprecedented contributions to laying down the foundations of Mauritian society during the early [[1900s (decade)|1900s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emrith|first=Moomtaz|title=The Muslims in Mauritius|year=1967|publisher=Emrith|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0uUPAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=amode+ibrahim+atchia&amp;dq=amode+ibrahim+atchia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j4lBUtagF8fZtQam1YDwAg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enterprise==
AIA is credited with setting up the ''Société Atchia Frères'', reconstructing the first [[mosque]] at [[Beau-Bassin Rose-Hill|Rose Hill]] following the historic cyclone of 1892, and constructing the first ice factory and saw mill since the 1920s, with technological innovations in use of wind-energy and pre-fabricated concrete. The Atchias also opened the first Indian-run primary school near the mosque. In 1900, Major with his brother Hossen, dammed a river near [[Reduit]] and built the first hydro electric plant and generated electricity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GANDHIJI’S HOSTS – "DIASPORIC" TRAJECTORIES: The Gujarati merchants – a powerful economic base|url=http://www.lemauricien.com/article/gandhiji%E2%80%99s-hosts-%E2%80%93-%E2%80%9Cdiasporic%E2%80%9D-trajectories-gujarati-merchants-%E2%80%93-powerful-economic-base|publisher=Lemauricien.com|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus introducing [[hydro-electric power]] to the people of [[Mauritius]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macmillan|first=Allister|title=Mauritius Illustrated: Historical and Descriptive, Commercial and Industrial Facts, Figures, &amp; Resources|year=1914|publisher=Asian Educational Services|page=424|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_EusZwEdxpAC&amp;pg=PA424&amp;dq=amode+ibrahim+atchia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j4lBUtagF8fZtQam1YDwAg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=amode%20ibrahim%20atchia&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; with AIA appointed as self-elected leader of Mauritius Hydro Electric Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Selvon|first=Sydney|title=A comprehensive history of Mauritius: from the beginning to 2001|year=2001|publisher=M.D.S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xd0wAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=amode+ibrahim+atchia&amp;dq=amode+ibrahim+atchia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j4lBUtagF8fZtQam1YDwAg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, he pioneered the country's first Cinema House in Rose Hill, and thereafter in 1930, built the Cinéma des Familles, in [[Port-Louis]], among  several others in the same decade, such as La Salle Mon Bijou at Rose Belle, the Salle des Fêtes at [[Mahebourg]], and the Cinema Coronation at [[Flacq]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2606">'''Anak Agung Bagus Suteja''' (1923 - 1966?) was the first governor of [[Bali]], appointed by President [[Sukarno]] in 1958, when Bali became a province.{{sfn|Pringle|2004|p=167}}He was the son of the last [[Raja]] of [[Jembrana]], Anak Agung Bagus Negara.

Anak Agung Bagus Suteja was influenced by nationalist ideas from his school years. After August 1945 he was actively involved with the Republicans in the [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian Revolution]] that strove to expel the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. The Dutch colonial authorities imprisoned him in 1948-49. After Indonesian independence he was appointed regional head (kepala daerah) of Bali by President Sukarno. As an administrator he was known as an incorruptible leftist idealist. Known as a "favoured son" of Sukarno, he was appointed governor when Bali when became a province of its own in 1958. He tried to stay above politics, but was sympathetic towards the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI).{{sfn|Robinson|1995|p=183-184}} After the coup events in [[Jakarta]] in 1965, Suteja was summoned to Jakarta for consultations, and replaced as governor in December that year. He later disappeared during the bloody purges accompanying the rise of [[Suharto]]'s '[[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]]'.{{sfn|Hägerdal|2002|p=176-181}}

Many Christian traditions, according to the Commentary on the Apocalypse of [[Andreas of Caesarea]], believe '''Saint Antipas''' to be the Antipas referred to in the [[Book of Revelation]], {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Revelation|chapter=2|verse=13}}, as the verse says: "I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth." The "faithful martyr" of [[Pergamon]], "where Satan dwelleth". According to [[Christian]] tradition, [[John the Apostle]] ordained Antipas as [[bishop of Pergamon]] during the reign of the Roman emperor [[Domitian]]. The traditional account goes on to say Antipas was [[martyr]]ed during the reign of Nero (54-68),&lt;ref name=oca&gt;[https://oca.org/saints/lives/2013/04/11/101052-hieromartyr-antipas-the-bishop-of-pergamum-and-disciple-of-st-join "Hieromartyr Antipas the Bishop of Pergamum and Disciple of St John the Theologian", Orthodox Church in America]&lt;/ref&gt; by burning in a [[brazen bull|brazen bull-shaped altar]] for casting out demons worshiped by the local population.

There is a tradition of oil ("manna of the saints") being secreted from the relics of Saint Antipas.&lt;ref&gt;From [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11228d.htm "Oil of Saints"] in Catholic Encyclopedia: "Following is a list of other saints from whose relics or sepulchres oil is said to have flowed at certain times: 1) St. Antipas, Bishop of Pergamum, martyred under Emperor Domitian ("Acta SS.," April, II, 4)." Retrieved January 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Antipas is invoked for relief from toothache, and diseases of the teeth. On the calendars of [[Eastern Christianity]], the feast day of Antipas is April 11.&lt;ref name=oca/&gt;

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

===Literature===
*[[Oedipus|Oedipus's]] downfall is directly linked to arrogance: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''
*Macbeth suffers from [[hubris]], leading to the murder of [[Duncan I of Scotland]]; he later becomes [[paranoia|paranoid]], leading him to order the deaths of [[Banquo]] and the family of [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]: ''[[Macbeth]]''
*[[Hamlet]] is indecisive and self-doubting, which thwarts him in avenging his father's murder.
*[[Victor Frankenstein]] suffers from excessive curiosity and irresponsibility, leading to the creation of the [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] that destroys his life: ''[[Frankenstein]]''
*[[Sigurd]] has a vulnerable spot on his back, where a linden leaf fell as he was bathing in dragon's blood: ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' 
*[[Agamemnon]] acts in greed when he takes [[Briseis]] away from [[Achilles]], losing the warrior's support in the [[Trojan War]]: ''[[The Iliad]]''. Achilles's own flaw was his own arrogance.
*[[Odysseus|Odysseus's]] flaw was an extreme [[Hubris (Ancient Greece)|hubris]] which led him to dishonor the god [[Poseidon]]. (''[[The Odyssey]]'')
*[[Cyrano De Bergerac]], despite his many accomplishments, suffers from self-doubt because of his huge nose which keeps him from pursuing the woman he loves.
*[[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] suffers from extreme depression, as well as extreme boredom due to his huge yet mostly inactive mind: ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*[[Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] extreme [[thanatophobia]] eventually transformed him into the vile Lord Voldemort in his pursuit for [[immortality]]. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Harry Potter]]'s worst flaws, as stated by Rowling, are "anger and occasional arrogance." However, within the text, it is implied his flaw might be his heroic desire to save people. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Percy Jackson]] has a fatal flaw of excessive personal loyalty, while his girlfriend Annabeth Chase shares the flaw of the legendary Odysseus: hubris. (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'')
*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]]. Whereas his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] compassion and love for his student blinded him to the path Skywalker was taking. (''[[Star Wars]]'')
*In ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Rick thinks of himself as an unfeeling cynic who denies the pain and disappointment from a failed love affair with Ilsa.
*In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the detective played by [[James Stewart]] is afraid of heights and has to climb a tower.
*[[Captain Hook]] is obsessed with ''[[Peter Pan]]''
*[[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], as a replicant, is powerful, but has a very short lifespan: ''[[Blade Runner]]''
*[[Oskar Schindler]] in the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' must overcome his greedy nature and find compassion to sacrifice in order to save his workers

===Television===
*[[B. A. Baracus]] is afraid of flying: ''[[The A-Team]]''
*[[Homer Simpson]] is an alcoholic, not too bright and prone to reckless choices: ''[[The Simpsons]]''
*[[Philip J. Fry]] (usually) has a severe lack of intelligence: ''[[Futurama]]''
*[[Londo Mollari]] yearns to return to the "glory days" of the [[Centauri Republic]]: ''[[Babylon 5]]''
*[[Mr. Spock]] relies heavily on logic and suppresses his more human emotions: ''[[Star Trek]]''
*[[Drake Mallard|Darkwing Duck/Drake Mallard]] has a big ego. ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''
*[[Peter Griffin]] is extremely impulsive and causes many problems for his family and friends: ''[[Family Guy]]''
*[[Zuko]] makes misguided decisions in an effort to gain his cruel father's acceptance: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Aang]] is too carefree and initially attempts to run from his responsibilities rather than face them: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Dean Winchester]] relies on family and is devastated when he loses them or they betray his trust: ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''
*[[The Tenth Doctor]] is constantly trying to help and save the lives of others, and sometimes does things out of anger that have dire consequences later: ''[[Doctor Who]]''
*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult. Her overcoming this flaw is a major story arc on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')

===Gaming===
* In [[Warhammer 40,000]], the Primarch Lorgar Aurelian is extremely devout and reveres his "father", the Emperor of Mankind, as a god. The Emperor envisages a human civilization free of the shackles of religion and dogma and chastises Lorgar and his legion for worshipping him. Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

'''David Hebner''' (born May 17, 1949) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling]] [[Professional wrestling authority figures|authority figure]], [[Professional wrestling promotion|promoter]], [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Agent|road agent]], and [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]].

==Career==
Hebner debuted as a professional wrestling referee in the late 1970s in the Richmond, Virginia area. In the 1980s he began working for the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], where he refereed many historic matches such as [[Randy Savage]] versus [[Ricky Steamboat]] at [[WrestleMania III]] and Randy Savage versus [[Hulk Hogan]] at [[WrestleMania V]]. Perhaps his most memorable appearance came on the February 5, 1988 episode of ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event|The Main Event]]'', when he was assigned to referee a match for the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] between Hulk Hogan and [[André the Giant]]. André defeated Hogan after Hebner's [[twin]] [[Sibling|brother]] [[Earl Hebner|Earl]] had switched places as Ted DiBiase had locked Dave in a closet.  Earl Hebner quickly counted to three as André [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinned]] Hogan, despite Hogan clearly having his shoulder up. The match and the WWF Championship were awarded to André as a result. Both Hebners received a [[United States dollar|$]]2,500 bonus for the match.

Prior to WrestleMania IV, the WWF attempted to extend the "evil twin" referee storyline through a [[kayfabe]] "[[investigative journalism|investigative report]]" published in the promotions' flagship publication, ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]''. The article used a fictional [[backstory]] to build sympathy for Dave by claiming he was continually victimized by Earl's misdeeds committed in Dave's name since their childhoods.&lt;ref&gt;"A ''WWF Magazine'' Investigative Report: Dave Hebner's Shadow," ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]'', June 1988, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 interview with "WWF Raw Magazine", Dave Hebner said the angle was soon dropped after he had suffered broken ribs when Earl kicked him (as part of the aftermath of the Hogan-Andre match during ''The Main Event''). As a result, the storyline was shifted to have Earl come clean, and he was the referee when [[Randy Savage]] won the Tournament final at WrestleMania IV against Ted DiBiase for the WWF Championship.

After retiring as a referee following [[knee replacement surgery]], Hebner became a [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Agent|road agent]]. He worked as a Road Agent until July 2005, when he was released from contract.

After being released, Hebner debuted in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] on the December 17, 2005 episode of ''[[TNA Impact!]]'', appearing on the stage during a match between [[The Dudley Boyz|Team 3D]] and [[The Diamonds in the Rough]].

Since 2012, Dave Hebner has been the manager of The Lumberjacks of MMWA Wrestling.

==Personal life==
Hebner has been married to his wife Rebecca for 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Dave's identical twin brother [[Earl Hebner|Earl]] and nephew [[Brian Hebner|Brian]] (Earl's son) are also wrestling referees. Hebner has [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE sued in wrestler class action lawsuit featuring Jimmy ‘Superfly’ Snuka, Paul ‘Mr Wonderful’ Orndorff|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/what-the-fox/wwe-sued-in-wrestler-class-action-lawsuit-featuring-jimmy-superfly-snuka-paul-mr-wonderful-orndorff/news-story/079fbd7db16f9cd71b7b569672baa4a5|work=[[FoxSports.com]]|date=July 18, 2015|accessdate=July 20, 2016|publisher=[[Fox Entertainment Group]] ([[21st Century Fox]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Hebner was named part of a [[class action]] lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that performers incurred "long term neurological injuries" and that the company "routinely failed to care" for them and "fraudulently misrepresented and concealed" the nature and extent of those injuries.  The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/breaking/ct-wwe-cte-lawsuit-20160719-story.html|title=Dozens of wrestlers sue WWE over CTE, effects of traumatic brain injuries|last=Bieler|first=Des|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=July 20, 2016|date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, US District Judge [[Vanessa Lynne Bryant]] dismissed the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piledriver: WWE uses 'Hell in a Cell' as springboard to future shows|url=https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/2018/09/22/wwe-uses-hell-cell-springboard-future-shows/1394073002/|work=[[Montgomery Advertiser]]|last=Robinson|first=Byron|date=September 22, 2018|accessdate=October 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3115">'''David Bevan Jones''' (1807–1863), also known by his bardic name ''Dewi Elfed'', was a Welsh Baptist minister who became a leading figure in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] and eventually emigrated to the United States of America.

He was born in 1807 in Gellifaharen, [[Llandysul]], Cardiganshire, the son of John and Hannah Jones.&lt;ref name="WBO Dewi Elfed"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=David Leslie|title=David Bevan Jones (Dewi Elfed)|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s3-JONE-BEV-1807.html?query=david+Bevan+Jones&amp;field=name|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a Baptist minister at Seion, [[Cwrtnewydd]] (1841–46),  Jerusalem, [[Rhymney]] (1846–48 ) and [[Gwawr, Aberaman]] from around the beginning of 1849. Soon after his arrival at Aberaman, he became embroiled in a conflict with [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Thomas Price]] of [[Calfaria, Aberdare]], who had been instrumental in establishing the new cause at Aberaman.&lt;ref name="WBO Dewi Elfed" /&gt; He was accused of being a follower of the Latter Day Saints and the congregation at Gwawr were expelled from the Glamorgan Baptist Association.&lt;ref name="WBO Dewi Elfed" /&gt;

In 1851 he approached William Phillips, leader of the Saints in Wales, and together with four others was baptised in the River Cynon on 27 April 1851, with a crowd of 2,000 in attendance.&lt;ref name="WBO Dewi Elfed" /&gt; Gwawr became a LDS Church but the Baptists took legal action to recover the building, In November 1851, [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Thomas Price]] led a march to recover the building.&lt;ref name="WBO Dewi Elfed" /&gt; On their arrival at Gwawr, it became apparent that Dewi Elfed had locked himself inside the chapel, along with one of his supporters. A court official stated that he did not have the authority to gain entry by forcing the door. Price then entered the building along with a deacon and there followed'a wild and exciting chase around the chapel galleries'.,&lt;ref name="CC DBJ"&gt;{{cite web|title=David Bevan Jones (Dewi Elfed) 1807–1863|url=http://www.cynonculture.co.uk/davidbevanjones.html|website=Cynon Culture|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Dewi Elfed was caught, and thrown out of the chapel by Price.&lt;ref name="CC DBJ" /&gt;

During the 1850s, Dewi Elfed was an active leader of the LDS Church in Wales and spent time in Llanelli and Swansea.&lt;ref name="WBO Dewi Elfed" /&gt; In 1855, however, he was accused of fraud and lost his official posts within the movement.&lt;ref name="WBO Dewi Elfed" /&gt;

In May 1860, he emigrated with his wife and two children to the United States but died of tuberculosis in [[Salt Lake City]] in may or June 1863.&lt;ref name="WBO Dewi Elfed" /&gt;

'''David Foster Wallace''' (February 21, 1962 – September 12, 2008) was an American writer and university instructor in the disciplines of [[English studies|English]] and [[creative writing]]. His novel ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' (1996) was listed by ''Time'' magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Grossman| first = Lev| author-link1 = Lev Grossman |first2=Richard |last2 = Lacayo |author-link2=Richard Lacayo| title = All-TIME 100 Novels| newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html| date=October 16, 2005 | access-date=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last novel, ''[[The Pale King]]'' (2011), was a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 2012.

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}} David Ulin called Wallace "one of the most influential and innovative writers of the last twenty years".&lt;ref name="LAT1"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Writer David Foster Wallace Found Dead| work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | first1=Claire| last1=Noland |first2=Joel |last2=Rubin| url = http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-wallace14-2008sep14,0,7461856.story| date =September 14, 2008 | access-date=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the writers who cite Wallace as an influence are [[Dave Eggers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/jest-fest-2611625 |title=Jest Fest |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=November 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zadie Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/107209/reader-keep|title=Reader: Keep Up!

==Life==
David Foster Wallace was born in [[Ithaca, New York]], to Sally Jean Wallace ({{Nee|Foster}}) and [[James D. Wallace|James Donald Wallace]], and was raised in [[Champaign, Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;Boswell and Burn, eds., p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; along with his younger sister, Amy Wallace-Havens.&lt;ref name="ttbook"&gt;{{cite interview|last=Wallace-Havens|first=Amy|interviewer=Anne Strainchamps|title=Amy Wallace-Havens on Her Brother|url=http://www.ttbook.org/book/amy-wallace-havens-her-brother|publisher=[[WCAI]]|location=Woods Hole, Massachusetts|date=2009-08-23|work=[[To the Best of Our Knowledge]]|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father is an emeritus professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His mother was a professor of English at [[Parkland College]], a community college in Champaign, which recognized her work with a "Professor of the Year" award in 1996. When Wallace was in fourth grade, his family moved to nearby [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], where he attended Yankee Ridge Elementary School and [[Urbana High School (Illinois)|Urbana High School]].

As an adolescent, he was a regionally ranked junior tennis player, an experience he wrote about in the essay "Derivative Sport in Tornado Alley", originally published in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' as "Tennis, Trigonometry, Tornadoes". Although his parents were atheists, Wallace twice attempted to join the [[Roman Catholic Church]], but "flunk[ed] the period of inquiry"; he later attended a [[Mennonite]] church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2008/november/1277253270/malcolm-knox/everything-more|title=Everything &amp; More: The Work of David Foster Wallace|first=Malcolm |last=Knox |authorlink=Malcolm Knox (author) |date=November 2008|work=[[The Monthly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patrickarden.com/DavidFosterWallace.html|title=David Foster Wallace warms up|first=Patrick |last=Arden|work=[[Book (magazine)|Book]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbird.com/2012/08/david-foster-wallace-went-to-church-constantly/|title=David Foster Wallace Went to Church Constantly?|first=David |last=Zahl|date=August 20, 2012|work=Mockingbird}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace attended [[Amherst College]], his father's alma mater, where he majored in English and philosophy, and graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1985. Among other extracurricular activities, he participated in [[glee club]]; his sister recalls that "David had a lovely singing voice".&lt;ref name="ttbook" /&gt; In studying philosophy, Wallace pursued [[modal logic]] and mathematics, and presented a senior thesis in philosophy and modal logic&lt;ref name="RyersonNYT"&gt;{{cite news| title = Consider the Philosopher| work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Ryerson |first=James |date=December 12, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/magazine/14wwln-Wallace-t.html?_r=2&amp;ref=magazine | accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was awarded the Gail Kennedy Memorial Prize and posthumously published as ''Fate, Time, and Language: An Essay on Free Will'' (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cms.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/philosophy/alumni |title=Our Alumni, Amherst College |publisher=[[Amherst College]] |date=November 17, 2007 |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time he graduated, with his honors thesis in English becoming the manuscript of his first novel, ''[[The Broom of the System]]'' (1987),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/aboutamherst/news/memoriam/node/65728 |title=In Memoriam: David Foster Wallace '85, Amherst College |publisher=[[Amherst College]] |date=September 14, 2008 |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace had committed himself to being a writer. He told [[David Lipsky]]: "Writing [''The Broom of the System''], I felt like I was using ninety-seven percent of me, whereas philosophy was using fifty percent." Wallace completed a [[Master of Fine Arts]] degree in creative writing at the University of Arizona in 1987. He then moved to Massachusetts to attend graduate school in philosophy at Harvard University, but soon left the program.

Wallace's biographer [[D.T. Max]] wrote in ''Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story: A Life of David Foster Wallace'' (2012), of Wallace's romantic obsession with the writer [[Mary Karr]] in the early 1990s, which resulted in his tattooing her name on his body.&lt;ref name="nymag.com"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=Evan |date=October 9, 2011 |url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/jeffrey-eugenides-2011-10/ |title=Just Kids Jeffrey Eugenides insists his new novel is not a roman à clef |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also considered killing her husband.&lt;ref name="artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com" /&gt; Wallace and Karr later had a tumultuous relationship, during which, Karr has said, Wallace once threw a coffee table at her, and another time tried to push her out of a moving car.&lt;ref name="nymag.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com"/&gt; In 2002, Wallace met the painter [[Karen L.

Wallace struggled with depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, and suicidal tendencies, with recurrent psychiatric hospitalizations. He stalked a woman of whom he was enamored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/779263461|title=Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story: A Life of David Foster Wallace|last=Max|first=Daniel (D.T.)|date=2012|publisher=Viking|year=|isbn=9780670025923|location=New York|pages=|oclc=779263461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs were important to him,&lt;ref name="Unfin"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Unfinished| work=[[The New Yorker]] |first= D.

==Work==
===Career===
''[[The Broom of the System]]'' (1987) garnered national attention and critical praise. In ''The New York Times'', the reviewer [[Caryn James]] called the novel a "manic, human, flawed extravaganza … emerging straight from the excessive tradition of [[Stanley Elkin]]'s ''The Franchiser'', [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[V.]]'', [and] [[John Irving]]'s ''[[The World According to Garp|World According to Garp]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Caryn |authorlink1=Caryn James |title=Wittgenstein Is Dead and Living in Ohio – The Broom of the System,|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/16/reviews/wallace-r-broom.html|accessdate=March 23, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 1, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Wallace began teaching literature as an adjunct professor at [[Emerson College]] in Boston. The next year, at the suggestion of colleague and supporter [[Steven Moore (US author)|Steven Moore]], Wallace obtained a position in the [[English studies|English]] department at [[Illinois State University]]. He had begun work on his second novel, ''[[Infinite Jest]]'', in 1991, and submitted a draft to his editor in December 1993. After the publication of excerpts throughout 1995, the book was published in 1996.

In 1997, Wallace received a [[MacArthur Fellowship]], as well as the [[Aga Khan Prize for Fiction]], awarded by editors of ''[[The Paris Review]]'' for one of the stories in ''Brief Interviews'' which had appeared in the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wallace|first1=David Foster|title=Brief Interviews with Hideous Men|journal=[[The Paris Review]]|date=Fall 1997|issue=144|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/fiction/1225/brief-interviews-with-hideous-men-david-foster-wallace|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, he moved to [[Claremont, California]], to become the first [[Roy E. Disney]] Professor of Creative Writing and Professor of English at [[Pomona College]]. He taught one or two undergraduate courses per semester and focused on writing.

Wallace delivered the commencement address to the 2005 graduating class at [[Kenyon College]]. The speech was published as a book, ''[[This Is Water]]'', in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/books/review/Bissell-t.html | title = Great and Terrible Truths | accessdate =December 8, 2010 | work=The New York Times | first=Tom | last=Bissell |authorlink= Tom Bissell | date=April 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, parts of the speech were used in a popular online video, also titled "This Is Water".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-mcguinness/david-foster-wallaces-bri_b_3239411.html | title = David Foster Wallace's Brilliant 'This Is Water' Commencement Address Is Now a Great Short Film | accessdate =May 9, 2013 | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | first=William | last=McGuinness | date=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonnie Nadell was Wallace's literary agent during his entire career.&lt;ref name="nyo"&gt;{{cite web | title = Remembering David Foster Wallace: 'David Would Never Stop Caring' Says Lifelong Agent| publisher=''Bay Ledger News Zone'' |last=Neyfakh |first=Leon |authorlink= Leon Neyfakh |date=September 17, 2008 | url = http://www.blnz.com/news/2008/09/17/Remembering_David_Foster_Wallace_David_1209.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Pietsch was his editor on ''Infinite Jest''.&lt;ref name="nyo2"&gt;{{cite web | title = Infinite Jest Editor Michael Pietsch of Little, Brown on David Foster Wallace | work=[[The New York Observer]] |last=Neyfakh |first=Leon |authorlink= Leon Neyfakh |date=September 19, 2008| url = http://www.observer.com/2008/media/little-brown-publisher-michael-pietsch-his-writer-david-foster-wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, [[Little, Brown and Company]] announced that it would publish the manuscript of an unfinished novel, ''[[The Pale King]]'', which Wallace had been working on before his death. ''The Pale King'' was pieced together by Pietsch from pages and notes Wallace left behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Maximized Revenue, Minimized Existence| first = Michiko |last=Kakutani |authorlink= Michiko Kakutani |work=[[The New York Times]]| date = March 31, 2011| accessdate = April 2, 2012

Throughout his career, Wallace published short fiction in periodicals such as ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[The Paris Review]]'', ''[[Mid-American Review]]'', ''[[Conjunctions]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Open City (magazine)|Open City]]'', ''[[Puerto del Sol]]'', and ''[[Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern]]''.

===Themes and styles===
Wallace wanted to progress beyond the [[irony]] and [[metafiction]] associated with [[postmodernism]]; in the essay "E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction" (1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=David Foster|title=E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction|journal=Review of Contemporary Fiction|volume=13|issue=2|pages=151–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; he proposed that television has an ironic influence on fiction, and urges literary authors to eschew TV's shallow rebelliousness: "I want to convince you that irony, poker-faced silence, and fear of ridicule are distinctive of those features of contemporary U.S. culture (of which cutting-edge fiction is a part) that enjoy any significant relation to the television whose weird, pretty hand has my generation by the throat. I'm going to argue that irony and ridicule are entertaining and effective, and that, at the same time, they are agents of a great despair and stasis in U.S. culture, and that, for aspiring fictionists, they pose terrifically vexing problems." Wallace used many forms of irony, but tended to focus on individual persons' continued longing for earnest, un-self-conscious experience and communication in a media-saturated society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rci.rutgers.edu/%7Ewcd/jestcomp.htm |title=A Reader's Companion to Infinite Jest |first=William C. |last=Dowling |authorlink=William C. Dowling |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |accessdate=February 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412061813/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~wcd/jestcomp.htm |archivedate=April 12, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace's fiction combines narrative modes and authorial voices that incorporate jargon and invented vocabulary, such as self-generated abbreviations and acronyms, long, multi-[[clause]] sentences, and an extensive use of explanatory [[Note (typography)|endnotes]] and footnotes, as in ''Infinite Jest'' and the story "Octet" (collected in ''[[Brief Interviews with Hideous Men]]'') and most of his non-fiction after 1996. In a 1997 interview on ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]'', Wallace said that the notes were to disrupt the linear narrative, to reflect his perception of reality without jumbling the narrative structure, and that he could have jumbled the sentences "but then no one would read it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLPStHVi0SI |title=Charlie Rose – Jennifer Harbury &amp; Robert Torricelli / David Foster Wallace |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the November 2007 issue of ''The Atlantic'', which commemorated the magazine's 150th anniversary, Wallace was among the authors, artists, politicians and others who wrote short pieces on "the future of the American idea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Lukas|title=Postirony: The Nonfictional Literature of David Foster Wallace and Dave Eggers|date=2016|publisher=transcript|location=Bielefeld|isbn=978-3-8376-3661-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These and other essays appear in three collections, ''[[A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again]], [[Consider the Lobster]],'' and the posthumous ''[[Both Flesh and Not]],'' the last of which contains some of Wallace's earliest work, including his first published essay, "Fictional Futures and the Conspicuously Young".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/d-f-w-s-nonfiction-better-with-age|title = D.F.W.'s Nonfiction: Better with Age|last = Max|first = D.

Some writers have found parts of Wallace's nonfiction implausible. Franzen has said that he believes Wallace made up dialogue and incidents: "those things didn't actually happen".&lt;ref name="A Supposedly True Thing Jonathan Franzen Said About David Foster Wallace"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dean|first=Michelle |authorlink= Michelle Dean |title=A Supposedly True Thing Jonathan Franzen Said About David Foster Wallace|url=https://theawl.com/a-supposedly-true-thing-jonathan-franzen-said-about-david-foster-wallace-8f37fd7c0bfd#.t1qt4lyho|website=[[The Awl]]|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Cook (reporter)|John Cook]] has remarked that "Wallace encounters pitch-perfect characters who speak comedically crystalline lines and place him in hilariously absurd situations...I used both stories ''[in teaching journalism]'' as examples of the inescapable temptation to shave, embellish, and invent narratives".&lt;ref name="There Is No Such Thing as a 'Larger Truth': This American Life's Rich History of Embellishment"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=John|title=There Is No Such Thing as a 'Larger Truth': This American Life's Rich History of Embellishment|url=http://gawker.com/5894913/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-larger-truth-this-american-lifes-rich-history-of-embellishment|website=[[Gawker]]|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In March 2010, the media announced that Wallace's personal papers and archives—drafts of books, stories, essays, poems, letters, and research, including the handwritten notes for ''[[Infinite Jest]]''—had been purchased by the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and they now reside at that university's [[Harry Ransom Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/09/books/09arts-DAVIDFOSTERW_BRF.html | work=The New York Times | title=David Foster Wallace Papers Are Bought | first=Patricia | last=Cohen | date=March 9, 2010 | accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual David Foster Wallace Conference was hosted by the [[Illinois State University]] Department of English in May 2014; the second was held in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faculty.sharepoint.illinoisstate.edu/dfw/Pages/Conference-Program.aspx|title=David Foster Wallace Conference Program 2015 |publisher=[[Illinois State University]]| accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, [[Loyola University New Orleans]] has offered English seminar courses on Wallace. Similar courses are also taught at [[Harvard University]].

In January 2017, the International David Foster Wallace Society and the ''Journal of David Foster Wallace Studies'' were launched.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dfwsociety.org/ The International David Foster Wallace Society.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptations===
====Film and television====
A [[Brief Interviews with Hideous Men (film)|feature-length film adaptation]] of ''Brief Interviews with Hideous Men'', directed by [[John Krasinski]] with an ensemble cast, was released in 2009 and premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = John Krasinski, 'Brief Interviews With Hideous Men'| author = Lee, Chris| url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-krasinski19-2009jan19,0,364630.story|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date = January 19, 2009| accessdate = April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received poor reviews.

The 19th episode of the 23rd season of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again]]" (2012), is loosely based on Wallace's essay "[[A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again]]". The Simpson family takes a cruise, and Wallace appears in the background of a scene, wearing a tuxedo T-shirt while eating in the ship's dining room; Wallace recounted having worn such a T-shirt "at formal suppers".{{Quote without source|date=June 2018}}

The 2015 film ''[[The End of the Tour (2015 film)|The End of the Tour]]'' is based on conversations [[David Lipsky]] had with Wallace, transcribed in ''[[Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself]]'' (2010). [[Jason Segel]] played Wallace, and [[Jesse Eisenberg]] Lipsky. The film won an Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the [[Sarasota Film Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2015 Sarasota Film Festival Awards|url=http://www.bradenton.com/2015/04/19/5753400/2015-sarasota-film-festival-awards.html|accessdate=11 September 2015|work=[[Bradenton Herald]]|date=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Segel was nominated for the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead]].

"Partridge", a Season 5 episode of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', repeatedly references ''Infinite Jest'', of which the show's co-creator, [[Michael Schur]], is a noted fan. Schur also directed the music video for [[The Decemberists]]' "Calamity Song", which depicts the Eschaton game from ''Infinite Jest.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJpfK7l404I|title=The Decemberists - Calamity Song|date=August 16, 2011|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stage and music ====
Twelve of the interviews from ''Brief Interviews with Hideous Men'' were adapted into a stage play in 2000, the first theatrical adaptation of Wallace's work. The play, ''Hideous Men'', adapted and directed by Dylan McCullough, premiered at the [[New York International Fringe Festival]] in August 2000.

''Brief Interviews'' was also adapted by director Marc Caellas as a play, ''Brief Interviews with Hideous Writers'', which premiered at Fundación Tomás Eloy Martinez in [[Buenos Aires]] on November 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrés |last=Hax |url=http://www.revistaenie.clarin.com/escenarios/teatro/Entrevistas_breves_con_escritores_repulsivos-Fundacion_TEM_0_583141891.html|title=Entrevistas repulsivas en la Fundación Tomás Eloy Martínez |date=November 1, 2011 |work=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315141724/http://www.revistaenie.clarin.com/escenarios/teatro/Entrevistas_breves_con_escritores_repulsivos-Fundacion_TEM_0_583141891.html |archivedate=March 15, 2016 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Infinite Jest'' was performed once as a stage play by Germany's experimental theater [[Hebbel am Ufer]]. The play was staged in various locations throughout [[Berlin]], and the action took place over a 24-hour period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2012/06/infinite_jest_on_stage_berlin_theater_adaptation_of_david_foster_wallace_s_novel_.html|author=Wiener, Aaron|title=Infinite Jest!

"Good Old Neon", from ''[[Oblivion: Stories]]'', was adapted and performed by Ian Forester at the 2011 [[Hollywood Fringe Festival]], produced by the Los Angeles independent theater company Needtheater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laist.com/2011/06/17/hollywood_fringe_festival_2011_deit.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105200702/http://laist.com/2011/06/17/hollywood_fringe_festival_2011_deit.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 5, 2017|title="Hollywood Fringe Festival 2011: 'Deity Clutch,' 'Dumb Waiter,' 'Glint'", LAist.|work=LAist|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "Surrounded by Heads and Bodies" from the album [[A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships|''A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships'']] by [[The 1975]], borrows its title from the opening line of ''Infinite Jest''.&lt;ref&gt;https://pitchfork.com/features/song-by-song/the-1975s-matty-healy-dissects-every-song-on-a-brief-inquiry-into-online-relationships/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matty Healy]], he lead singer of The 1975, revealed in a interview with Pitchfork discussing the new album that he was inspired by the novel after reading it during a stint in rehab: "I was reading [''Infinite Jest''] when I was in rehab. There was no one there. It was me and my nurses, who’d come in and check on me, and then Angela [the protagonist of the song], miles away. I was surrounded by no one, and the book was just open on the front page, as most copies of ''Infinite Jest'' are ..... nobody reads [''Infinite Jest''] all the way! Everyone our age has got a battered, quarter-read copy of ''Infinite Jest''."&lt;ref&gt;https://pitchfork.com/features/song-by-song/the-1975s-matty-healy-dissects-every-song-on-a-brief-inquiry-into-online-relationships/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Wallace's father said that David had suffered from [[major depressive disorder]] for more than 20 years and that [[antidepressant]] medication had allowed him to be productive.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; Wallace experienced severe side effects from the medication&lt;ref name="RS" /&gt; and in June 2007 stopped taking [[phenelzine]], his primary antidepressant drug, on his doctor's advice.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; His depression recurred, and he tried other treatments, including [[electroconvulsive therapy]]. Eventually he went back on phenelzine but found it ineffective.&lt;ref name="RS"/&gt; On September 12, 2008, at age 46, Wallace wrote a two-page suicide note, arranged part of the manuscript for ''[[The Pale King]]'' and hanged himself from a rafter of his house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D.

The {{nihongo|'''Death Busters'''|デスバスターズ|Desu Basutāzu}} are a group of fictional characters who serve as [[antagonist]]s in the ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' manga series written by [[Naoko Takeuchi]]. This group comprises the antagonists of the third major story arc, which is called the ''Infinity'' in the manga and ''[[Sailor Moon S]]'' in the anime. They are first introduced in chapter #24 "Infinity 1 – Premonition", originally published in Japan on July 7, 1994.&lt;ref name="JPVolume7"&gt;{{cite book |last= Takeuchi |first= Naoko | authorlink = Naoko Takeuchi | title= 美少女戦士セーラームーン (7) |publisher= [[Kodansha]] |date=June 1994 |isbn= 4-06-178781-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Cloverway English adaptation, they are called the "Heart Snatchers".

Originally from the "Tau Ceti Star System" in another dimension, the Death Busters acquire human host bodies to act through with [[#Kaolinite|Kaolinite]] and [[#Professor Tomoe|Professor Tomoe]] as acting leaders. Based in {{nihongo|Mugen Academy|無限学園|Mugen Gakuen|Literally "Infinity Academy"}}, an elite high school built in the middle of Tokyo's {{nihongo|Sankakusu District|三角州区|Sankakusu-ku|Literally "Delta District"}}, the Death Busters work to gather human souls which would prolong their dying homeworld. Their ultimate goal is the revival of their commander [[#Mistress 9|Mistress 9]] so they can bring their master [[#Master Pharaoh 90|Pharaoh 90]] to Earth and terraform it into a new home at the cost of the current life forms.

==Key figures==
===Professor Tomoe===
{{nihongo|'''Professor Souichi Tomoe'''|土萠 創一|Tomoe Sōichi Kyouju}} is the leader of the Death Busters and [[Sailor Saturn|Hotaru Tomoe]]'s father. A genetic scientist forced out of the scientific community for his unethical experiments, he sold his findings to companies and bought the entire Sankakusu District to continue his research to create "Super Beings". But a fire occurs in Tomoe's apartment that killed his wife Keiko and gravely wounded his daughter Hotaru. Tomoe saves his daughter by outfitting her body with cybernetic limbs during a freak storm that brought the Death Busters to Earth, the aliens apparently attracted to his darkness. Witnessing his assistant be reborn as Kaolinite, Tomoe sold his soul to Pharaoh 90 and willfully discards his humanity by ingesting a Daimon Egg to become a hybrid as he began to build Mugen Academy while working to perfect the stability of Daimon/human hybrids. When Super Sailor Moon and the Outer Guardians arrive at his lab and dispatch his Daimon test subjects, Tomoe changes into his Daimon form {{nihongo|'''Germatoid'''|ゲルマトイド|Gerumatoido}}. Sailor Moon is forced to kill Tomoe with her Rainbow Moon Heart Ache, Hotaru briefly seen saying goodbye to her father while accepting that he died a long time ago after her mother's death.

In the first anime, Hotaru's injury and the Death Busters' arrival occurring at the same time, Professor Tomoe's story is the same with the exception that he was forcefully possessed by Germatoid. Tomoe also survived the ordeal as Germatoid left his body and is destroyed by Sailor Uranus and Neptune, attempting to reach Hotaru and later losing his memories following the final battle as he is entrusted with his reborn daughter's care until the season premiere of ''Sailor Stars'', when [[Setsuna Meioh]] comes to retrieve her, and after that he is not seen again in the series.

Professor Tomoe appears in several [[Sailor Moon musicals|musicals]]. In the ''Last Dracul'' arc, his body is possessed by an alchemist known as {{nihongo|'''Undead Berserk'''|アンデッド・ベルセルク|Andeddo Beruseruku}}. Using Tomoe's laboratory, Berserk tries to create perfect homunculi in order to replace human beings; however, his first homunculi, the [[#Death Mannetjes|Death Mannetjes]], turned out to be flawed creatures. Although Tomoe is possessed by Berserk, the latter shows concern for Hotaru.

Professor Tomoe is voiced by [[Akira Kamiya]] in ''Sailor Moon S'' and by [[Takuya Kirimoto]] in ''Crystal''. In the Cloverway Inc. English adaptation produced in association with Optimum Productions, he is voiced by [[Jeff Lumby]]. In the Viz Media English adaptation, he is voiced by [[Keith Silverstein]]. In the musicals, he has been portrayed by Shunsaku Yajima, Ryuuji Kasahara, Kaname Aoki and Yuuki Kaon.

===Kaolinite===
{{nihongo|'''Kaolinite'''|カオリナイト|Kaorinaito}} is the Commander of the Witches 5 with the title of [[Magus]], named after the mineral of the [[Kaolinite|same name]]. Originally {{nihongo|'''Kaori Kuromine'''|黒峰カオリ|Kuromine Kaori}}, she was Tomoe's assistant before being infected with a Daimon Egg that consumes her humanity while pledging her loyalty to Pharaoh 90. Serving as Pharaoh 90's emissary, with access to Tairon Crystal, Kaolinite convinces Tomoe to offer himself and Hotaru to the Death Busters. Despite no longer being human, Kaolinite retained some of her former self like her infatuation with Tomoe. Posing as Mugen Academy's headmistress, communicating with Pharaoh 90 to relay his orders, Kaolinite directs the Witches 5 to deal with the Sailor Guardians and eventually take the Legendary Silver Crystal while also making attempts to prevent the awakening of Sailor Saturn whom she deemed a threat to her group. After the Witches 5 have all been killed and Mistress 9 had awakened, Kaolinite is given the task to kill the Sailor Guardians herself before the Outer Guardians intervene. This forces Kaolinite to assume her Daimon form prior to being destroyed by Super Sailor Moon's Rainbow Moon Heartache attack.

In the first anime adaptation, her role is changed to oversee the initial Death Buster attacks, Kaolinite seeks out the three Talismans to obtain the Legendary Holy Grail. Her Daimons having attacked [[Sailor Mars]], [[Sailor Mercury]], and [[Sailor Jupiter]] prior, Kaolinite targets Sailor Moon while deducing her identity and ends up appearing to fall to death from [[Tokyo Tower]] in the resulting battle. But Kaolinite survived, though she lost her memory and Tomoe placed her Hotaru's guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcp.com/doi/smoon/ |title=Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon |accessdate=October 6, 2006 |last=Doi |first=Hitoshi |authorlink=Hitoshi Doi |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902105102/http://www.tcp.com/doi/smoon/ |archivedate=September 2, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaolinite eventually regains her memories, stealing Chibiusa's Pure Heart to offer to Mistress 9 so she can win Tomoe's love. But Kaolinite, after Tomoe congratulated her, is killed off when she is thrown into an electrified wall by Mistress 9 for "having served her purpose."

The [[Sailor Moon musicals|stage musicals]] follow the manga version, though no mention of what was occurring at the time of the lightning strike is made, and the event is not shown, only mentioned. The musicals imply Kaori to be her original name, as she is always addressed as Kaori-Kun in Hotaru's presence by Professor Tomoe who states she has been helping them out since, at least, his wife's death. In ''Usagi Ai no Senshi e no Michi'', she leads another set of minions, the [[#Death Nightmares|Death Nightmares]].

In ''Sailor Moon S'', she is voiced by [[Noriko Uemura]]. In ''Crystal'', she is voiced by [[Hikari Yono]]. In the Cloverway Inc. English adaptation, her name is changed to Kaorinite (though she retains her original name in her second incarnation) and is voiced by [[Kirsten Bishopric|Kirsten Bishop]]. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by [[Tara Platt]]. In the musicals, Kaolinite is played by Keiko Hanayama, Mutsumi Fukuma, and Miki Kawasaki.

===Mistress 9===
{{nihongo|'''Mistress 9'''|ミストレス9|Misutoresu Nain}} is a malevolent entity who is Pharaoh 90's partner, sent to oversee her master's arrival to Earth with Tomoe implanting her Daimon Egg in the comatose body of Hotaru. But Mistress 9 did not fully awaken with Hotaru suffering seizure fits that reside while in the presence of a Tairon Crystal fragment, though Mistress 9 slowly becomes more active when exposed to the light of the Legendary Silver Crystal. After the Witches 5 have all been killed, her influence overwhelming Hotaru as she force grows her vessel into a woman with long hair, Mistress 9 steals Chibiusa's soul and Legendary Silver Crystal while using the latter as a replacement power source when she conducts the ritual to summon Pharaoh 90 to Earth. As Pharaoh 90 begins to manifest, Mistress 9 attempts to rip herself out of Hotaru's body to assume her true form. But Mistress 9 is surprised to find that Hotaru's soul still exists and is inhibiting the entity from leaving her body, managing to thwart her by forcing her to leave his body to restore the souls of the Inner Guardians and Chibiusa to their bodies. Mistress 9 attempts to steal Sailor Moon's Silver Crystal before Sailor Chibimoon arrives, both assuming their Super forms to overwhelm Mistress 9. But when Pharaoh 90 fully manifests, Mistress 9 allows herself to be assimilated into her master with Sailor Saturn later manifesting from what remained of Mistress 9.

In the anime, Mistress 9 makes her presence known early as she occasionally controls Hotaru to communicate with the Death Busters. But Mistress 9 fully awakens once obtaining Chibiusa's Pure Heart Crystal, killing Kaolinite for serving her purpose in her revival. Mistress 9 attempts to use a large machine to guide Pharaoh 90 to Earth so that he may destroy it. Sailor Moon tries to stop her and Tomoe, now freed from Germatoid, attempts to reach her, still seeing her as Hotaru. She attacks both of them but is injured by energy emanating from the machine. Tomoe takes her in his arms and Hotaru's spirit begins to respond. Mistress 9 attempts to subdue her once again but Hotaru's memories of both her father and of Chibiusa prove to be overpowering. It results with Hotaru awakening as Sailor Saturn, her power destroying Mistress 9 at the cost of her body.

In ''Sailor Moon S'', Mistress 9's voice is provided by [[Yuko Minaguchi]] and [[Yukiyo Fujii]] provides her voice in ''Crystal''. In the CWI English dub she is voiced by [[Susan Aceron]]. In the Viz Media English dub, she is voiced by [[Christine Marie Cabanos]]. In the musicals two actresses have played her: Tomoko Inami and Chinatsu Akiyama.

===Master Pharaoh 90===
{{nihongo|'''Master Pharaoh 90'''|{{ruby|師|マスター}}ファラオ{{ruby|90|ナインティ}}|Masutā Farao Nainti}} is a malevolent interdimensional being from "Tau Ceti Star System", an amorphous being who is both the mastermind of the Death Busters and the originator of the Daimons. As the Tairon Crystal that he uses for substance is nearly spent with his domain on the verge of collapse, Pharaoh 90 uses the spatial distortions in Tokyo's Sankakusu district to send an advance guard of Daimon Eggs to make preparations for his coming. Pharaoh 90's goal is assimilate Earth and terraform it into a new home for himself and his Daimon spawn. As his right hand Mistress 9 was inactive at the time, Pharaoh 90 communicated with Kaolinte at the top of Mugen Academy as he senses both the Legendary Silver Crystal and an unawakened Sailor Saturn whom he expresses dread towards.

Mistress 9 retrieved Chibiusa's future Silver Crystal with Pharaoh deeming it as a replacement for the obsolete Tairon Crystal as he is brought to Earth via an established portal. Once on Earth, Sailor Moon describing his form as that of "black lava reeking of death", Pharaoh absorbs Mistress 9 while beginning to cover the entire Earth despite the Outer Guardians' attempts to contain him within Sankakusu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Kurozuki | year = 2005 | title = Act 33 - Infinity 10: Infinity | url = http://www.kurozuki.com/takeuchi/sailormoon/old/act33.html | work = Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Manga Translations | publisher = The Manga of Takeuchi Naoko | accessdate = 2005-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With Pharaoh 90 able to absorb their attacks, Sailor Moon attempted to sacrifice herself by unleashing the powers of the Legendary Holy Grail and the Silver Crystal while within the entity. But the gambit caused the Outer Guardians' Talismans to resonate and awaken Sailor Saturn, who uses her "Death Reborn Revolution" to weaken Pharaoh 90 but stayed her hand from killing him when Sailor Moon emerged unharmed. The dying Pharaoh 90 attempts to flee back into the Tau System as Saturn gives chase, having Sailor Pluto use her "Dark Dome Close" to seal the dimensional distortion and trap Pharaoh 90 within his dying world. Like all of the head villains in the manga, Pharaoh 90 is later revealed to be an incarnation of [[Chaos (Sailor Moon)|Chaos]], the ultimate enemy of the series.

In ''Sailor Moon S'', Pharaoh 90 appears as a huge, black eyeball-like sphere with tentacles who is simply acting on an impulse to destroy Earth and recruited Tomoe by providing him with Mistress 9's Daimon Egg. When portal is opened by Mistress 9, Pharaoh 90 begins to surface before being destroyed by Sailor Moon (empowered by the other Soldiers) and the newly awakened Sailor Saturn.

Pharaoh 90 is voiced by [[Takaya Hashi]] in ''Crystal'', with [[Michael Sorich]] (in his first two appearances) and John Eric Bentley voicing him in the English version. Jeff Lumby provides vocal effects in the Cloverway Inc. English adaptation.

==Witches 5==
The {{nihongo|'''Witches 5'''|ウィッチーズ5|Witchīzu Faibu}} is a subset of the Death Busters led by Kaolinite, artificial human/Daimon hybrids created by Tomoe. The Witches 5 pose as Mugen Academy [[prefects#Academic|prefects]] while given the task to gather souls, or "Hostes," of the student body to both prolong the Tau Ceti Star System and provide vessels for Daimon Eggs. They are seen as either being equal to or stronger than the main Sailor Guardians, whom they target for their interference with the promise of being promoted to Magus level. Kaolinite would later revive the Witches 5 as Mugen Academy's first line of defense when the Sailor Guardians storm the school.

In the anime, the Witches 5 are led by Professor Tomoe and work as researchers in an underground lab and compete amongst themselves for his approval. While first given the task to search for the Talismans until Eudial's death, altering the "Witches 5" sign on their door to reflect the number of remaining members, the remaining Witches 5 members are later instructed by [[#Mistress 9|Mistress 9]] to find "pure hearts" instead. In the Cloverway English adaptation, the name is changed to Bureau of Bad Behavior.

===Eudial===
{{nihongo|'''Eudial'''|ユージアル|Yūjiaru}} is the first member of the Witches 5 who appears. She is a red-haired humanoid with a rank of Level 78 and able to use the "Fire Buster" flame torrent attack, named for the mineral [[Eudialyte]] is her namesake. Under the alias of {{nihongo|'''Yuko Arimura'''|有村ゆうこ|Arimura Yūko}}, she is the Etiquette class prefect in charge of Mugen Academy's Philosophy division. Eudial uses her position to bring newly enrolled students to a mountain retreat on "Mount M" for an orientation that doubles as a ritual to extract their Hosties. While retaining her human form in ''Crystal'', Eudial assumes her [[medusa]]-like Daimon form to overwhelm Sailors Mars and Jupiter when they interfere before being killed by Sailor Moon. When Kaolinite revives the Witches 5 for her curse against the Sailor Guardians, Eudial targets Mars's insecurities and later attacks Sailor Moon before destroyed by the Outer Guardians.

In the anime, Eudial seems to be the oldest of the group, and is much resented by the others &amp;mdash; particularly Mimete &amp;mdash; because Professor Tomoe seems to favor her. She is referred to as Chief by the other members. Eudial is generally fairly even-tempered and level-headed; however, she is also portrayed as a reckless [[driving|driver]]. A brilliant inventor, she is able to construct and [[jury rig]] weaponry and computer technology through the use of everyday items, like her deadly shoulder-mounted [[flamethrower]], the Fire Buster, and later in the series booby-traps the under-construction Marine Cathedral. Eudial actually succeeds in getting two of the Talismans, but loses them to [[Sailor Pluto]]. She uses the Fire Buster to try to attack [[Sailor Moon (character)|Super Sailor Moon]], but she deflects it back to her. Furious, she escapes in her car, only to find that Mimete has torn out its brakes and filled it with snails. The car crashes through a barrier into the sea below, killing her instantly.

Voice actor [[Maria Kawamura]] provides her voice for the original Japanese production and [[Chiaki Takahashi (actress)|Chiaki Takahashi]] voices her in ''Crystal''. Canadian actress [[Loretta Jafelice]] does her voice for the Cloverway English adaptation, in which her name is changed to "Eugeal". In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by [[Erin Fitzgerald]]. In the musicals, she is played by Hitomi Tsumura and Saya Chinen.

===Mimete===
{{nihongo|'''Mimete'''|ミメット|Mimetto}} is the orange-haired member of the Witches 5 with a rank of Level 40 and able to use the "Charm Buster" attack, named for the mineral [[mimetite]]. Under the alias of {{nihongo|'''Mimi Hanyu'''|羽生美々|Hanyū Mimi}}, she is a [[pop idol]] who is prefect of Mugen Academy's Arts Division. She uses her cover to hold a concert for Mugen Academy students to take their Hosties, having not expected Sailor Venus to be attending under the guise of a Mugen student. When the other Sailor Guardians arrive, Mimete is forced to fight them with support from Daimons created from some of the students. But she ends up being killed by Sailor Uranus. When Kaolinite revives the Witches 5 for her curse against the Sailor Guardians, Mimete targets Venus through her fantasy and later attacks Sailor Moon before destroyed by the Outer Guardians.

In the anime adaptation, while ditzy and targeting celebrities, Mimete is assigned to collect Pure Heart Crystals after she orchestrated Eudial's death. Out of all the Witches 5, she is the least organized and the most easily distracted. She can launch mirages in the shape of stars at her opponents and induces severe vertigo and disorientation, capable of rendering someone unconscious in seconds. After several failed attempts at collecting hearts, she tries to use one of Eudial's abandoned inventions (Witches Electric Warp). The machine would transport a person inside of a television, which would increase that person's power exponentially. However, if the power to the television were disconnected while the user was still inside, the user would be trapped within it forever (the exact reason why Eudial never used it). Tellu mercilessly imprisons Mimete by pulling the plug off the machine.

In the original anime, she is voiced by [[Mika Kanai]] and in ''Crystal'', she is voiced by Yuki Nagaku. [[Catherine Disher]] provides her voice in the Cloverway Inc. English adaptation, in which her name is changed to "Mimet". In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by [[Kira Buckland]]. In the musicals, she is played by Shiori Honda and Aki Kudou.

===Viluy===
{{nihongo|'''Viluy'''|ビリユイ|Biriyui}} is the white-haired member of the Witches 5 with a rank of Level 202 and able to use nano-machines to completely obliterate her enemy in her "Mosaic Buster" attack, named for the mineral [[Wiluite|viluite]]. She acts under alias of {{nihongo|'''Yui Bidoh'''|美堂ゆい|Bidō Yui}}, Mugen Academy's top student and prefect of the Computer Club, using her nano machines to turn computers into Hoste-sucking machines for the Mugen Prep School held in Mugen Academy. Viluy attempts to take Mercury's soul, but ends up being killed by Sailor Uranus. When Kaolinite revives the Witches 5 for her curse against the Sailor Guardians, Viluy targets Mercury's insecurities and later attacks Sailor Moon before destroyed by the Outer Guardians.

In the anime, Viluy is handed the task of gathering pure hearts after Tellu's death. She collects the pure hearts from the students using a supercomputer, controlled by her wristband. She overpowers Sailors Mercury, Uranus and Neptune using nano machines controlled by her wristband. Sailor Moon damages Viluy's wristband and the Witch ends up being consumed when her Mosaic Buster rebounded on her.

Viluy also appears in the [[Sailor Moon musicals|stage musicals]]. She is voiced by [[Yoshino Takamori]] in the original anime and by Rina Hon'izumi in ''Crystal''. In the Cloverway Inc. English adaptation, her names were changed to "Byruit" and "Julie Bidoh" and is voiced by Daniela Olivieri. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by [[Julie Ann Taylor]] (as name of 'Cricket Brown'). In the musicals, she is played by Nao Futatsugi, Yuka Kuwahara and Yui Hasegawa.

===Tellu===
{{nihongo|'''Tellu'''|テルル|Teruru}} is the green-haired member of the Witches 5 with a rank of Level 404 and able to use the "Mandragora Buster" attack, named for the mineral [[tellurite]]. She acts under the alias of {{nihongo|'''Lulu Teruno'''|照野留々|Teruno Ruru}} and is prefect of Mugen Academy's Physical Education class and Botanical Garden, providing a number of her artificial Telluns plants to the populace to absorb Hostes from their victims. Though her scheme is found out by the Sailor Guardians as they confront her, Tellu overpowers the Sailor Guardians before assuming her Daimon form to finish them off. But Tellu ends up being killed by a newly re-awakened Sailor Pluto. When Kaolinite revives the Witches 5 for her curse against the Sailor Guardians, Tellu targets Jupiter's insecurities and later attacks Sailor Moon before destroyed by the Outer Guardians.

In the first anime, after deposing of Mimet, Tellu's role is slightly different as she opens a flower shop to sale her Telluns before being confronted by Sailors Moon, Chibi Moon, Pluto, and Tuxedo Mask. When her Telluns being destroyed, Tellu mutates the last into a Hyper-Tellun to kill the group. But Tuxedo Mask hurls one of his roses at Tellu and causes her to lose the Pure Heart Crystals she gathered, resulting with her being attacked by her own creation. Tellu electrocutes the Hyper-Tellun in an attempt to break free, but it self-destructs and she is consumed in the explosion.

She was voiced by [[Chieko Honda]] until episode 31 of ''Sailor Moon S''. In ''Crystal'', she is voiced by Naomi Ozora. In the Cloverway Inc. English adaptation, her name is changed to "Telulu" and is voiced by [[Julie Lemieux]]. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by [[Laura Post]]. In the musicals, she is played by Mio Nunokawa, Akiko Iwasaki and Momoko Sadachi.

===Cyprine and Ptilol===
{{nihongo|'''Cyprine'''|シプリン|Shipurin}} and {{nihongo|'''Ptilol'''|プチロル|Puchiroru}} are collectively the final member of the Witches 5 with a rank of Level 999 and able to use the "Ribbon Buster" attack. In the ''Materials Collection'', author [[Naoko Takeuchi]] states that Ptilol is an extension of Cyprine, Ptilol normally within Cyprine's body until they split into two separate beings. The two are mirror-imaged with Cyprine having blue hair and eyes with a braid with a bun on top on the right side of her head and dresses in blue, while Ptilol has red hair and eyes, a braid with a bun on top on the left side of her head and dresses in red. The two are named for the minerals [[Vesuvianite|cyprine]] and [[clinoptilolite]].

As prefect of Mugen Academy's business division and sorcery class, Cyprine is tasked by Kaolinite specifically to take care of Haruka and Michiru after the two revealed their true colors. While caught off guard that her quarry are Sailors, Cyprine uses her power to have all the Sailor Guardians save Sailor Moon turn on each other. While she and Ptilol split to dodge her initial attack on them, Sailor Moon manages to kill the twin witches after transforming into Super Sailor Moon and using her "Rainbow Moon Heartache" attack on them again. When Kaolinite revives the Witches 5, Cyprine and Ptilol oversee the Sailor Guardians ensnarement in their trap. After their teammates dealt with the other Sailor Guardians, the twins join the other Witches 5 in overwhelming Sailor Moon before they are all destroyed by the Outer Guardians.

In the anime, while still the last of the Witches 5, Cyprine's story is altered to have her make a final attempt of gathering Pure Hearts for Mistress 9's revival. When the Sailor Guardians interfere, she and Ptilol split and overwhelm the group with one twin blocking an attack aimed at the other and using the absorbed energy to counter while increasing their power. But the Sailors formulate a counter strategy with Sailor Mercury using her Bubble spray to obscure the area so they can force Cyprine and Ptilol apart, tricking the two into blasting each other as both are killed when their staves are overloaded by the excess energy.

In ''Sailor Moon S'', [[Yuriko Fuchizaki]] did the voice of Cyprine and [[Rumi Kasahara]] did the voice of Ptilol. In ''Crystal'', they are both voiced by [[Umeka Shōji]]. In the Cloverway Inc. English version, their names are changed to "Cyprin" and "Petirol". They are voiced by Naomi Emmerson and Sara Sahr. In the Viz Media English adaptations, both Cyprine and Ptilol are voiced by [[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]]. In the musicals, only Cyprine has made an appearance, and she is played by Michiho Matsumoto, Saeri Amano and Maana.

==Servants==

===Death Mannetjes===
The {{nihongo|'''Death Mannetjes'''|デス・マネッチャーズ|Desu Manecchāzu}} are servants of Professor Tomoe in the musicals ''Usagi Ai no Senshi e no Michi'', ''Henshin - Super Senshi e no Michi'', and its revision. They are four men portrayed as thinking highly of themselves and as masters of disguise. The Mannetjes are tasked with finding the talismans, and are rivals of Kaolinite's own set of minions: the Death Nightmares. They are killed by the Sailor Soldiers, but are revived by Sailor Moon at the end of the musical. Their leader is Death Ra, and other members include Death Ri, Death Ru and Death Debu Re. They are respectively played by Ryuuji Kasahara, Masakazu Idono, Masayuki Ozaki, and Kouhei Kowada.

The Death Mannetjes appear in the ''Last Dracul'' musical. They are homunculi created by Undead Berserk while he takes over Tomoe's body and laboratory. They have no relation to the Death Busters in this version. The Mannetjes have different names in this continuity: Death Pa, Death Pi, Death Pu and Death Pe. They are respectively portrayed by Jun Kanzaki, Seiko Takuma, Takashi Kashiwagi and Yoshiya Yukimura.

===Death Nightmares===
The {{nihongo|'''Death Nightmares'''|デス・ナイトメア|Desu Naitomea}} are nameless servants of Kaolinite the musical ''Usagi Ai no Senshi e no Michi''. They are portrayed as beautiful, seductive women with silver hair, and have a rivalry with the Death Manntjes in the heart snatching. They use a Daimon named Gondola to steal Chibiusa's pure crystal heart, but they are stopped by Sailors Uranus and Neptune, and later killed by the Soldiers, only to be revived by Sailor Moon at the end of the musical. They are played by Kaori Ishikawa, Ado Endou, Yuuko Matsumoto, Eri Ikemoto, Hisako Doubayashi, Yoshiko Nakahara, and Junko Oyama.

In the ''Last Dracul'' musical, they are female dream demons, appearing again as beautiful and seductive women but with dark hair. Some of them are named in this arc: Olam Tiphareth, Roi Malkuth, and Elyon Yesod; however, there are other unnamed members. They have no relation to the Death Busters in this version; since Kaolinite does not appear in this musical, their leader is Undead Berserk's right-hand woman, {{nihongo|Death Lamia|デス・ラミアー|Desu Ramia}}. The ''Last Dracul'' Death Nightmares are portrayed by Miki Kawasaki, Ado Endou, Noriko Yamakawa, Junko Yamauchi, and Izumi Ogino.

==Daimon==
The {{nihongo|'''Daimon'''|ダイモーン|Daimōn}} are purplish-skinned amorphous monsters deployed by the Death Busters to carry out several tasks, normally used as their enforcers. Being a form of life native to the Tau System, the Daimons that manifest on Earth as special pods called Daimon Eggs which need to assimilate host bodies in a process called Vesselization to survive the planet's conditions, both Kaolinite and a willing Tomoe being such examples of the hybridization. But when Tomoe attempted to replicate the process he used to create the Witches 5, a process that combines genetic manipulation and cybernetic modification, the result are malformed [[Atavism|Atavized]] worm creatures which the others called failed experiments despite Tomoe's opinion of the monsters. When defeated, humans recently turned into Daimons revert to their original state while the Daimon Egg shatters upon being ejected.

In the first anime, the Cloverway dub calling them "Heart Snatchers" or "Demonaes", the Daimons serve as [[monster-of-the-day|monsters-of-the-day]]. Appearing as red feminine liquid humanoids in their natural state, the Daimons are artificially created by Tomoe and Vesselize objects to assume personalized form. The first batch of Daimon Eggs used by Kaolinte were allowed to randomly enter objects on their whim and possess a Death Buster mark somewhere on their bodies that allows them to extract a Heart Crystal from their target. When Eudial takes over search for he Talismans, Tomoe built an specialized [[oven]] to create fixed Vesselizations with the resulting Daimons created as bodyguards for the witch. The final batch of Daimons, combining the roles of the previous two with the task to revive Mistress 9, are created by Tomoe to aid Mimete and are modified with [[cormorant]] traits so they can suck out a Heart Crystal by simply kissing their prey. When defeated, the object reverts to its original state with the Daimon Egg destroyed in the process. After the remaining Witches 5 have all been killed, the remaining Daimon Eggs all hatched and serve as a barrier to prevent the Sailor Guardians from entering Mugen Academy. After the final battle, one Daimon survived and Vesselized with the oven to become {{nihongo|Rangy|レンジ|Renji}}. Rangy acts on her instincts as a Daimon to gather Hearts and attacks the city until the Sailor Guardians stop her, destroying both her and the oven.

The musicals also portray them as using human hosts, but have more in common in appearance with the anime version.

'''Denis Crispin Twitchett''' (23 September 1925{{snd}}24 February 2006) was a British [[Sinologist]] and scholar who specialized in [[Chinese history]], and is well known as one of the co-editors of ''[[The Cambridge History of China]]''.

==Biography==
Denis Twitchett was born on 23 September 1925 in [[London, England]]. He read Modern Chinese at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] at the [[University of London]] in 1946-47 before moving on to read the Oriental Studies at Cambridge from 1947-50. He was a lecturer at the [[University of London]] (1954–56) and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (1956–60), the Chair of Chinese at the universities of London (1960–68) and Cambridge (1968–80), and the Gordon Wu '58 Professor of Chinese Studies at [[Princeton University]] (1980–94). He was a fellow of the [[British Academy]] from 1967. He greatly expanded the role of Chinese studies in Western intellectual circles.

During [[World War II]], Twitchett took a crash course in Japanese and for the remainder of the war he was part of the [[Bletchley Park]] operations acting as a listener at one of the forward listening stations in [[Sri Lanka]]. After the war he gained a degree in [[geography]] at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]]. He also spent a great deal of time in [[Japan]] and was able to learn from the best Japanese historians of China (who tended to focus on [[Tang Dynasty|Tang China]], a period which became his field of expertise also). He married Umeko Ichikawa in 1956. Together they had two children.

==The Cambridge History of China==
{{main|The Cambridge History of China}}
Starting in 1966, Professor Twitchett and historian [[John K. Fairbank]] (who taught at [[Harvard]]) began plans for the first comprehensive history of China to be published in the English language. Originally expected to be a six volume set of books, the series expanded as time passed and eventually grew to the currently planned 15 volumes. While he was at Princeton, Twitchett worked closely with fellow Sinologist [[Frederick W. Mote]] (who had a related wartime experience). 

Drawing upon the most respected living historians for individual chapters of the books, the series (though still incomplete as of late 2007) is very highly regarded as an authoritative history of China. Twitchett wrote many sections and guided the creation of the whole series from the start until his death.

Twitchett deliberately held off creating a book on China before the Ch'in because, as Twitchett put it in the preface to Volume 7, there was still so much work to be done on the period. Since that time the history has become better understood and in 1999 a companion volume ''The Cambridge History of Ancient China, From the Origins of Civilization to 221 BC'' edited by [[Michael Loewe]] and Edward L. Shaughnessy was published.

* Printing and Publishing in Medieval China (1983)
* The Writing of Official History Under the T’ang (1992)

Twitchett was the expert who helped create the China maps for "The Times Atlas of World History" (first published in 1979).

{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}
The '''Eight Great Eminent Officials''' ({{zh|c=八大元老|p=Bā dà yuánlǎo}}), abbreviated as the '''Eight Elders''' ({{zh|c=八老|p=Bā lǎo}}), were a group of elderly members of the [[Communist Party of China]] who held substantial power during the 1980s and 1990s. In the English-speaking world, these men are often called '''The Eight Immortals''' as an [[allusion]] to the Taoist deities commonly known as the [[Eight Immortals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joseph|first=William A.|title=Politics in China: An Introduction|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-533530-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kk80evDTZIYC&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in "strongman politics" ==
The politburo system was created by the Bolsheviks in 1917, when [[Vladimir Lenin]] established it to command and control the [[October Revolution]]. It was later adopted by the Chinese communists.  In both the early Chinese and Russian politburos, "strongman politics" played a large role in internal decision-making. Politburos under both [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong]] were later criticized for being dysfunctional and largely decorative, allowing the top leaders to dictate both party policy and the fate of the other leaders.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Under [[Deng Xiaoping]], important decisions were often made in Deng's home with a caucus of eight senior party cadres, called "Eight Elders". Deng ruled as paramount leader, although he never held the top title of the party or the state. However, Deng was able to remove three Party leaders with the aid of the Eight Elders. [[Hua Guofeng]] was gradually removed from Premier and Party Chairman between 1980 and 1981; [[Hu Yaobang]] was removed in 1987; and, [[Zhao Ziyang]] was removed in 1989.&lt;ref name=scmp20120420xiang&gt;Xiang, Lanxin (Apr 20, 2012). "Bo Xilai probe shows up China's outdated system of government". ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descendants ==
Descendants of the Eight Elders who have benefited significantly from nepotism and cronyism constitute a group now known as "the [[Princelings]]" or the "Crown Prince Party". Its members, rising through party ranks, can easily overrule any opposition in their jurisdictions, even if they are assigned to a local administrative position. They are often seen to outrank other party officials and possess greater prestige due to their lineage.&lt;ref name=scmp20120420xiang/&gt; Bloomberg has reported on the extensive wealth accumulated by these descendants via their roles in various public and private companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heirs of Mao’s Comrades Rise as New Capitalist Nobility|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-26/immortals-beget-china-capitalism-from-citic-to-godfather-of-golf.html|accessdate=December 28, 2012 | work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HuntsvilleUnitHuntsvilleTX.jpg|thumb|The [[Huntsville Unit]], a [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]]-operated prison in Huntsville, the home of the state's execution chamber]]
'''Eric Charles Nenno''' (April 13, 1961 – October 28, 2008), was a convicted [[sex offender]] who was executed for the 1995 rape and murder of seven-year-old  Nicole Benton. He was executed in 2008 in [[Huntsville, Texas]], becoming the 1128th&amp;nbsp;murderer to be executed in the United States since 1976. He was the 13th murderer executed in Texas in 2008 and the 418th murderer executed in Texas since 1976.&lt;ref name="clarkprosecutor1"/&gt;

== The case ==
Nicole Benton from [[Hockley, Texas]] disappeared on March 23, 1995, during a birthday party organized by her father Buddy Benton, a friend and neighbor of Eric Nenno who lived a few houses down the road in a house belonging to the Bentons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.txexecutions.org/reports/418.asp?page=2 Report at TEIC]&lt;/ref&gt;

As Buddy was playing with his country music band, Nenno lured Nicole, who was playing in the front yard, to his home on the pretense of getting a guitar to join the group. The moment Nenno and Nicole were inside his home he struggled to rape her. As Nicole cried and resisted, he strangled her to death. He raped her lifeless body for several days and hid her corpse in his attic, stuffing her clothing in a filing cabinet. Nicole's polka-dot dress, glasses, and shoes were later found in this cabinet.

A few days after Nicole's disappearance, law enforcement agents showed up at Nenno's home&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080602174803/http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/statistics/deathrow/drowlist/nenno.jpg Nenno @ www.tdcj.state.tx.us via Web Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; to question him.  Neighbors had told Detective Johnson that Nenno, a former plumbing supply salesman, had been accused of groping a six-year-old neighborhood girl two years before. Johnson then referred it to Detectives Wedgeworth and Taber for a follow-up investigation and they went to the Nenno's home at 17602 Bullis Gap&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/maps/@30.0224679,-95.8032937,3a,75y,5.22h,82.4t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sh9t_8QduEgSzYzKpWdOVmg!2e0?hl=en House of the crime @ google maps]&lt;/ref&gt; three times on the afternoon of March 25, 1995. On two occasions Nenno did not answer the door.

On the third occasion, Nenno, dressed only in a white bath-towel around his waist, finally answered the door. Nenno indicated that he was willing to talk about the missing girl, and invited the detectives to enter the house. He seemed very cooperative and willing to speak. When the detectives asked him whether he knew Nicole, he became visibly nervous and shaky, and denied knowing or ever seeing her before. Nenno then allowed the detectives to search his house. Detective Wedgeworth conducted a brief search, but found nothing out of the ordinary.

The detectives asked Nenno why someone in the neighborhood would suggest that he be checked out. He replied that there had been an incident in the spring when he was accused of trying to lure a girl into his house and pull off her pants. After this question, Nenno became visibly shaken and much more nervous. The two detectives had been at Nenno's house for approximately ten minutes, and before leaving,  asked him if he would go to the command post for further questioning. After signing a [[legal release]], Nenno stated he had no problem with that. Police informed him that a trailer had been set up several blocks away as a command post during the ongoing search for Nicole by law enforcement and volunteers from the community of Hockley. Wedgeworth and Taber later stated that they made no promises or threats to Nenno during this initial encounter. After dressing, Nenno showed up a few minutes later at the command post and Detective Taber read Nenno his [[Miranda warning|Miranda rights]]. 

Taber asked Nenno if he understood his rights and he indicated that he did. Taber then asked him if he wanted to waive his rights and talk about the missing girl; he agreed to talk to the detectives. He appeared to understand the interview process which was conducted in a very moderate tone. Taber spoke with Nenno for almost an hour, and during the interview he was offered food and drink. From the start of the interview, Detective Taber reminded Nenno that he was not under arrest, and could leave at any time.

When Detective Taber asked Nenno if he knew why he was there, he replied: “You think I'm a suspect in the missing little girl's case”. 
Taber then asked him why he thought that he would be considered a suspect. Nenno replied that it was because of a past incident when he had lured a little girl to his residence and removed her pants, and because he liked children. When asked what he had done the night Nicole had disappeared, he stated that he had arrived home, changed clothes, gone outside and talked to his neighbor, and then went back inside. Nenno said he had been drinking a six-pack of beer. When asked if there was any reason why a neighbor would say that they had seen him on the same street where Nicole had disappeared, Nenno responded: “Well, maybe I could have been outside my house by the fence, but I just don't remember”. Taber asked Nenno the same question again and he replied: “Well, it might have been possible but I don't remember”.

After a polygraph, authorities remained silent for several minutes, prompting Nenno to finally say: "I failed it, didn't I?″ When the examiner told Nenno he needed to disclose the girl's location, Nenno said: "I think she's still in the attic″. He then said: "They're going to kill me for this, aren't they?"

Finally Nenno gave written authorization to law enforcement to search his home. During the search of Nenno's house, Nicole's body  Nicole was found and Nenno was arrested. Nicole had been choked to death and raped repeatedly.

In his confession, Nenno admitted to having sexual visions of young girls for most of his life, as well raping and strangling Nicole in his bedroom.&lt;ref name="clarkprosecutor1"&gt;[http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/nenno1128.htm Nenno @ clarkprosecutor.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sentencing ==
On February 1, 1996 the [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] jury, that heard the case, deliberated for about 11 hours, before deciding on the death penalty for Eric Nenno.&lt;ref name="clarkprosecutor1"/&gt;

In an interview from death row one week before his scheduled execution, Nenno said that, at the time of the killing, he was addicted to pornography and had been drinking. He also said that nothing could excuse his crime. "I can't apologize enough", he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.txexecutions.org/reports/418.asp?page=2 www.txexecutions.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedural history ==
On January 18, 1996 a [[Harris_County,_Texas|Harris County]] jury convicted Nenno of capital murder; he was sentenced to death by the District Court in Harris County on February 1st. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Nenno's conviction and sentence on June 24, 1998. Nenno filed an application for state [[habeas corpus]] on October 16, 1998 but was denied relief on November 14, 2001.
Nenno petitioned the federal courts for writ of habeas corpus relief on October 18, 2002; the federal district court dismissed Nenno's case without prejudice on January 13, 2004. Nenno filed a successive application for state habeas corpus relief on February 11, 2004 which was dismissed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals June 23, 2004. On August 10, 2004 Nenno returned to federal court, and petitioned for habeas relief. On March 7, 2006 the U.S. District Court denied habeas relief, and denied a COA. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied his application for a COA on June 6, 2007. On March 24, 2008 the U. S. Supreme Court denied [[certiorari]] review.
On June 10, 2008,  Nenno petitioned for clemency with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141206003521/https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/oagNews/release.php?id=2702 www.texasattorneygeneral.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Execution ==
On October 28, 2008, Eric Charles Nenno, was executed by lethal injection in [[Huntsville Unit]] in Texas. Nenno did not look at Buddy Benton or the other members of the victim's family who attended his execution. When asked if he wanted to make a last statement, he replied, ''"No, warden."'' The lethal injection was then started. He gasped four times and eight minutes later at 6:20&amp;nbsp;p.m., Nenno was pronounced dead.&lt;ref name="clarkprosecutor1"/&gt;

== Final meal ==
His [[last meal]] was a grilled [[cheeseburger]], four [[Fish Cake|fish patties]], six [[Boiled egg|hard boiled eggs]] and some coffee.

'''James Everett Sanders''' (March 8, 1882 – May 12, 1950) was an [[United States|American]] [[political figure]]. He was [[Secretary to the President (US)|Presidential secretary]] to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Calvin Coolidge]] and chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Coalmont, Indiana]], Sanders attended the [[Indiana State University#History|Indiana State Normal School]], now [[Indiana State University]], and then graduated from [[Indiana University]]. He practiced law in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]]. From 1917 until 1925 Sanders represented Indiana in the [[United States Congress]]. He declined to be re-nominated in 1924, and instead became director of the Speakers' Bureau of the Republican National Committee. Subsequently, in 1925, he accepted the job and replaced [[C. Bascom Slemp]] as the personal secretary to President Coolidge early in his second term.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,928646,00.html|title=A Sanders for a Slemp.|date=1925-01-26|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as presidential secretary (a position equivalent to the current [[White House Chief of Staff]]) Sanders amassed a collection of presidential speeches that became known as the 'Everett Sanders Papers',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/coolbib:@field(NUMBER+@band(amrlm+@syn(ms01+ms02+ms03+ms04+ms05+ms06+ms07+ms08+ms09+ms10+ms11+ms12+ms13+ms14+ms15+ms16+ms17+ms18+ms19+ms20+ms21+ms22+ms23+ms24+ms25+ms26+ms27+ms28+ms29+ms30+ms31+ms32+ms33+ms34+ms35+ms36+ms37+ms38+ms39+ms40+ms41+ms42+ms43+ms44+ms45+ms46+ms47+ms48+ms49+ms50+ms51+ms52+ms53+ms54+ms55+ms56+ms57+ms58+ms59+ms60)))|title=The Everett Sanders Papers.|publisher=[[The Library of Congress]]|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contain speeches from June 22, 1925 until February 22, 1929. Sanders also became a member of the [[Alfalfa Club]] after 1926.

Sanders was so highly regarded that, after leaving the position in 1929 after Coolidge's second term, President [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed him to chair the Republican National Committee, a position he held from 1932 until he stepped down in 1934 after Hoover's [[United States presidential election, 1932|disastrous re-election campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,754078,00.html|title=Sanders Steps down.|date=1934-05-14|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanders died in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1950, and is buried in Indiana, in the [[Highland Lawn Cemetery]] in [[Terre Haute]].

A '''fetch''' is a supernatural [[doppelgänger|double]] or an [[Ghost|apparition]] of a living person in Irish folklore. It is largely akin to the [[doppelgänger]], and sightings are regarded as omens, usually for impending death. The origin of the term is unclear.

==Description==
The fetch is described as an exact, spectral double of a living human, whose appearance is regarded as ominous. As such, it is similar to the Germanic [[doppelgänger]], and to some conceptions of the British [[Ghosts in European culture#Terminology|wraith]].&lt;ref name=OEDfetch&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=December 1989|title= Fetch, n.2|journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/69589|accessdate=15 January 2011|quote=| trans_title= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OEDwraith&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=December 1989|title= Wraith, ''n''. b.|journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230504?redirectedFrom=wraith#eid |accessdate=26 November 2012|quote=| trans_title= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Grose]] associated the term with [[Northern England]] in his 1787 ''Provincial Glossary'', but otherwise it seems to have been in popular use only in Ireland. A sighting of a fetch is generally taken as a portent of its exemplar's looming death, though [[John Banim|John]] and [[Michael Banim]] report that if the double appears in the morning rather than the evening, it is instead a sign of a long life in store.&lt;ref name=OEDfetch/&gt;

The etymology is obscure. It may derive from the verb "fetch";&lt;ref name=OEDfetch/&gt; the compound "fetch-life", evidently referring to a [[psychopomp]] who "fetches" the souls of the dying, is attested in [[Richard Stanyhurst]]'s 1583 translation of the ''[[Aeneid]]''.&lt;ref name=OEDfetchlife&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=December 1989|title= Fetch-life|journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/69598|accessdate=15 January 2011|quote=| trans_title=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternately, the word may derive from ''fæcce'', found in two [[Old English]] glossaries.&lt;ref name=Neville&gt;Neville, pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In both texts, ''fæcce'' is glossed for ''[[mare (folklore)|mære]]'', a spirit associated with death and [[nightmare]]s.&lt;ref name=Neville/&gt; The word may be Old English in origin, though it would have been atypical for the author to gloss one English word with another.&lt;ref name=Neville/&gt; He seems to have regarded it as a [[Latin]] word, though it is unattested in Latin. Instead, it may be [[Irish language|Irish]], which could be the origin of the [[Hiberno-English]] ''fetch''.&lt;ref name=Neville/&gt;

The term "fetch" is sometimes glossed for the Scandinavian ''[[fylgja]]'', an animal alter ego in [[Norse mythology]] connected to a person's fate, though unlike the Irish concept, the ''fylgja'' is almost always female.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, p. 59 and note 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pulsiano, p. 624&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
Corresponding to its contemporary prominence in "national superstitions", the fetch appeared in [[Irish literature]] starting in early 19th century. "The fetch superstition" is the topic of John and [[Michael Banim]]'s [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] story "The Fetches", from their 1825 work ''[[Tales by the O'Hara Family]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, pp. 178–179; note 98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Kennedy (Irish writer)|Patrick Kennedy]]'s 1866 [[folklore]] collection ''[[Legendary Fiction of the Irish Celts]]'' includes a brief account of "The Doctor's Fetch", in which a fetch's appearance signals death for the titular doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, "The Doctor's Fetch".&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, "The Fetch" is the malevolent narrator of [[Patrick McCabe (novelist)|Patrick McCabe]]'s 2010 novel ''[[The Stray Sod Country]]'', wherein it temporarily inhabits the bodies of the residents of a small Irish town, causing them to commit both psychological and physical harm to themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;Schreers, Julia; "Bedeviled", ''The New York Times Book Review'', pg. BR19, 10 October 2010. https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/books/review/Scheeres-t.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[deuteragonist]] of [[Catherynne M. Valente|Catherynne M. Valente's]] 2015 novel [[The Boy Who Lost Fairyland]] is a fetch who is quickly recognized by the parents of the dying child she is to replace and is able to overcome her destructive nature in their care.

'''Gilberto Passos Gil Moreira''' (born 26 June 1942), known professionally as '''Gilberto Gil''' ({{IPA-pt|ʒiɫˈbɛxtu ʒiɫ|br}} or {{IPA-pt|ʒiu̯ˈbɛɾtʊ ʒiu̯|}}), is a Brazilian singer, guitarist, and songwriter, known for both his musical innovation and political activism. From 2003 to 2008, he served as Brazil's [[Ministry of Culture (Brazil)|Minister of Culture]] in the administration of President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. Gil's musical style incorporates an eclectic range of influences, including rock, [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian genres]] including [[samba]], [[Music of Africa|African music]], and [[reggae]].

Gil started to play music as a child and was a teenager when he joined his first band. He began his career as a [[bossa nova]] musician and grew to write songs that reflected a focus on political awareness and social activism. He was a key figure in the [[Música popular brasileira]] and [[Tropicalismo|tropicália]] movements of the 1960s, alongside artists such as longtime collaborator [[Caetano Veloso]]. The [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|Brazilian military regime]] that [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|took power]] in 1964 saw both Gil and Veloso as a threat, and the two were held for nine months in 1969 before they were told to leave the country. Gil moved to London, but returned to [[Bahia]] in 1972 and continued his musical career, as well as working as a politician and environmental advocate.

== Early life (1942–1963) ==
Gil was born in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and spent much of his childhood in nearby [[Ituaçu]].

Caetano [Veloso] and I followed in the tradition of [[Luiz Gonzaga]] and [[Jackson do Pandeiro]], combining samba with northeastern music."&lt;ref name=quinn/&gt; American music critic [[Robert Christgau]] said that along with [[Jorge Ben]], Gil was "always ready to go further out on a beat than the other samba/bossa geniuses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=6 April 1993|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv393-93.php|title=Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the pioneers of tropicália, influences from genres such as rock and [[punk rock|punk]] have been pervasive in his recordings, as they have been in those of other stars of the period, including Caetano Veloso and Tom Zé. Gil's interest in the [[blues]]-based music of rock pioneer [[Jimi Hendrix]], in particular, has been described by Veloso as having "extremely important consequences for Brazilian music".&lt;ref name=veloso&gt;Veloso (2003), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Veloso also noted the influence of Brazilian guitarist and singer [[Jorge Ben Jor|Jorge Ben]] on Gil's musical style, coupled with that of traditional music.&lt;ref name=veloso/&gt; After the height of tropicália in the 1960s, Gil became increasingly interested in black culture, particularly in the Jamaican musical genre of [[reggae]]. He described the genre as "a form of democratizing, internationalizing, speaking a new language, a [[Martin Heidegger|Heideggerian]] form of passing along fundamental messages".&lt;ref name=behague&gt;{{cite journal |last=Béhague |first=Gerard |authorlink=Gerard Béhague |date= Spring–Summer 2006 |title=Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985–95) |journal= Latin American Music Review |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages= 79–90 |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/latin_american_music_review/v027/27.1behague08.html |doi=10.1353/lat.2006.0021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visiting [[Lagos]], Nigeria, in 1976 for the Festival of African Culture (FESTAC), Gil met fellow musicians [[Fela Kuti]] and [[Stevie Wonder]].&lt;ref name=katz/&gt; He became inspired by African music and later integrated some of the styles he had heard in Africa, such as [[juju]] and [[highlife]], into his own recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title='Brazil has a new energy' |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/07/01/bmgil01.xml |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=July 1, 2003 |accessdate= 2008-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous of these African-influenced records was the 1977 album ''Refavela'', which included "No Norte da Saudade" (''To the North of Sadness''), a song heavily influenced by reggae.&lt;ref&gt;Crook (2005), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; When Gil returned to Brazil after the visit, he focused on Afro-Brazilian culture, becoming a member of the Carnaval afoxé group Filhos de Gandhi.

Conversely, his 1980s musical repertoire presented an increased development of dance trends, such as [[disco]] and [[soul music|soul]], as well as the previous incorporation of rock and punk.&lt;ref name=behague/&gt; However, Gil says that his 1994 album ''Acoustic'' was not such a new direction, as he had previously performed unplugged with Caetano Veloso. He describes the method of playing as easier than other types of performance, as the energy of acoustic playing is simple and influenced by its roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afropop.org/multi/interview/ID/6 |title=Interview: Gilberto Gil (1995) |accessdate=2008-05-03 |last=Eyre |first=Banning |author2=Gil, Gilberto |date=June 3, 1995 |work=Afropop Worldwide |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513214850/http://www.afropop.org/multi/interview/ID/6 |archivedate=May 13, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gil has been criticized for a conflicting involvement in both authentic Brazilian music and the worldwide musical arena. He has had to walk a fine line, simultaneously remaining true to traditional Bahian styles and engaging with commercial markets. Listeners in Bahia have been much more accepting of his blend of music styles, while those in southeast Brazil felt at odds with it.&lt;ref name=behague/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2496">'''Goreu fab Custennin''' (also spelled as '''Gorau''') is a hero of [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] and early [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian mythology]], the son of Custennin, and cousin to [[King Arthur|Arthur]], [[Culhwch]] and [[Illtud|Saint Illtud]] through their grandfather [[Amlawdd Wledig]]. He is a significant character in the [[Middle Welsh]] Arthurian tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', and also appears in a number of other medieval texts. His name may be derived from {{lang|mga|'''Gorneu'''}}; "of Cornwall."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''Bromwich, Rachel. ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein.''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Role in Welsh tradition==

===How Culhwch won Olwen===

[[File:Culhwch.jpg|thumb|[[Culhwch]] entering Arthur's Court in the Welsh tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', 1881]]

While on the quest to locate the stronghold of [[Ysbaddaden Bencawr]], [[Culhwch|Culhwch ap Cilydd]] and his six companions come across a [[shepherd]] and his flock. They learn that he is Ysbaddaden's brother, and that the giant has murdered twenty-three of his twenty four children. In a bid to save their youngest son from suffering the same fate, the shepherd and his wife hide him away in a chest. [[Sir Kay|Cai]], one of [[King Arthur|Arthur's]] foremost [[knight]]s, offers to take the boy with him on the quest for [[Olwen]], promising to fight to the death to protect him. The unnamed child later assists Cai and [[Bedivere|Bedwyr]] in the murder of Wrnach the Giant, fighting through three courtyards of the giant's ''llys.'' It is through this adventure that he earns his name, {{lang|mga|'''Goreu'''}}; "The Best."

It is Goreu who ultimately slays Ysbaddaden, dragging him to the mound by his hair and there [[decapitation|decapitating]] him. He then placed the [[head on a stake]] on the citadel and claims his fort and territory as his own, thus avenging the deaths of his brothers.

===Other appearances===

He later appears in the Arthurian romance ''[[Three Welsh Romances#Geraint and Enid|Geraint fab Erbin]]'' in which he is named as one of the four squires of Arthur's court and rides alongside the hero [[Geraint]] on his journey to [[Cornwall]]. In ''[[Breuddwyd Rhonabwy]]'', he appears briefly as one of Arthur's twenty four chief councillors. The ''[[Welsh Triads]]'' refer to a tradition in which Goreu rescued Arthur from three enchanted otherworldy prisons."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

He was a member of the [[Solomonic Dynasty]] who traced his lineage to Emperor [[Menelik I]] via his Shewan royal ancestors as a great-grandson of king [[Sahle Selassie]]. Haile Selassie's father was Makonnen Wolde-Mikael Gudessa (መኮንን ወልደሚካኤል ጉዴሳ) and his mother was Yeshimebet Ali Aba Jifar (የሺመቤት አሊ አባ ጅፋር).

His internationalist views led to Ethiopia becoming a charter member of the [[United Nations]], and his political thought and experience in promoting [[multilateralism]] and [[collective security]] have proved seminal and enduring.&lt;ref&gt;Karsh, Efraim (1988), ''Neutrality and Small States''.

Haile Selassie was known as a child as '''Lij Tafari Makonnen''' (Amharic {{lang|gez|ልጅ ተፈሪ መኮንን}}; ''lij teferī mekōnnin''). ''[[Lij (title)|Lij]]'' is translated as "child", and serves to indicate that a youth is of noble blood. His given name, ''Tafari'', means "one who is respected or feared". Like most Ethiopians, his personal name '''Tafari''' is followed by that of his father [[Makonnen Wolde Mikael|Makonnen]] and rarely that of his grandfather Woldemikael.  His [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] name '''Haile Selassie''' was given to him at his infant baptism and adopted again as part of his [[regnal name]] in 1930.

As Governor of Harar, he became known as '''Ras Tafari Makonnen''' {{audio|Ras Teferi Mekonnen.ogg|listen}}. ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Ras]]'' is translated as "head"&lt;ref name= babylon172&gt;{{Harvnb |Murrell | pp = 172–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a rank of nobility equivalent to ''[[Duke]]'';{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, p. xiii}} though it is often rendered in translation as "prince". In 1916, [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Empress]] [[Zewditu I]] appointed him to the position of ''Balemulu Silt'an [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Enderase]]'' ([[Regent]] Plenipotentiary). In 1928, she granted him the throne of Shewa, elevating his title to ''[[Negus]]'' or "King".&lt;ref name="africamediaonline.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Haile Selasie: 40 year anniversary of his death |url= http://www.africamediaonline.com/mmc/gallery/detail/african_calendar/haile-selasie:-120th-aniversary-of-his-birth |website= African calendar | publisher = Africa Media Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 1930, after the death of Empress Zewditu, Tafari was crowned ''Negusa Nagast'', literally [[King of Kings]], rendered in English as "[[Emperor]]".&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Neil|date=11 February 2015|title=Freedom as Marronage|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xoMLBgAAQBAJ |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|page=175|accessdate=12 October 2015|isbn=9780226201047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his ascension, he took as his regnal name Haile Selassie I. ''Haile'' means in Ge'ez "Power of" and ''Selassie'' means [[trinity]]—therefore ''Haile Selassie'' roughly translates to "Power of the Trinity".{{Sfn |Murrell | p = 159}}  Haile Selassie's full title in office was "By the Conquering [[Lion of the Tribe of Judah]], [[His Imperial Majesty]] Haile Selassie I, [[Emperor of Ethiopia|King of Kings]] of Ethiopia, Elect of God".&lt;ref&gt;Lee V.

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Lij Teferi and his father, Ras Makonnen.jpg|thumb|170px|right|''Ras'' Makonnen Woldemikael and his son ''Lij'' Tafari Makonnen]]
Haile Selassie's royal line (through his father's mother) descended from [[Sahle Selassie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalark.net/Ethiopia/shoa3.htm |title= Shoa 3 |publisher=Royal ark | accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born on 23 July 1892, in the village of [[Ejersa Goro]], in the [[Harar]] province of Ethiopia. His mother was Woizero ("Lady") [[Yeshimebet Ali|Yeshimebet Ali Abba Jifar]], daughter of the renowned [[Oromo people|Oromo]] ruler of [[Wollo]] province [[Dejazmach]] Ali Abba Jifar.&lt;ref name="Moor"&gt;de Moor, Jaap and Wesseling, H. L. (1989), ''Imperialism and War: Essays on Colonial Wars in Asia and Africa''. Brill. {{ISBN|9004088342}}, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandmother was of [[Gurage people|Gurage]] heritage.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Woodward, Peter (1994), ''Conflict and Peace in the Horn of Africa: federalism and its alternatives''. Dartmouth Pub. Co. {{ISBN|1-85521486-5}}, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Tafari's father was Ras [[Makonnen Woldemikael Gudessa]], the governor of Harar. Ras Makonnen served as a general in the [[First Italo–Ethiopian War]], playing a key role at the [[Battle of Adwa]];&lt;ref name="Moor"/&gt; he too was paternally Oromo but maternally [[Amhara people|Amhara]].&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; Haile Selassie was thus able to ascend to the imperial throne through his paternal grandmother, Woizero Tenagnework Sahle Selassie, who was an aunt of Emperor [[Menelik II]] and daughter of Negus [[Sahle Selassie]] of Shewa. As such, Haile Selassie claimed direct descent from [[Makeda]], the Queen of Sheba, and King Solomon of ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]].{{Sfn |Shinn | p = 265}}

Ras Makonnen arranged for Tafari as well as his first cousin, [[Imru Haile Selassie]], to receive instruction in Harar from [[Abba Samuel Wolde Kahin]], an Ethiopian [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|capuchin monk]], and from Dr. Vitalien, a surgeon from [[Guadeloupe]]. Tafari was named [[Dejazmach]] (literally "commander of the gate", roughly equivalent to "[[count]]"){{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, p. xii}} at the age of 13, on 1 November 1905.&lt;ref name= so193 /&gt; Shortly thereafter, his father Ras Makonnen died at [[Kulibi]], in 1906.&lt;ref name=rad712&gt;{{Harvnb |Roberts | p = 712}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governorship===
&lt;!--NOTE: Several sources state that Tafari assumed governorship of Harar in 1906, but this is incorrect, and contradicted by better and more numerous sources.--&gt;
[[File:Tafari Dejazmatch Harrar.jpg|thumb|left|180 px|''Dejazmatch '' Tafari, as governor of Harar]]
Tafari assumed the titular governorship of Selale in 1906, a realm of marginal importance,&lt;ref name= jah&gt;{{Harvnb |White | pp = 34–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but one that enabled him to continue his studies.&lt;ref name= so193 /&gt;  In 1907, he was appointed governor over part of the province of [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]]. It is alleged that during his late teens, Haile Selassie was married to ''Woizero'' Altayech, and that from this union, his daughter [[Princess Romanework]] was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.solomoniccrownheraldry.org/history_of_ethiopia_monarchy_modern_era_part_seven.htm |title= Modern era |work= History of Ethiopia |publisher= Solomonic crown heraldry |accessdate= 12 September 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100926152149/http://www.solomoniccrownheraldry.org/history_of_ethiopia_monarchy_modern_era_part_seven.htm |archivedate= 26 September 2010 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of his brother Yelma in 1907, the governorate of Harar was left vacant,&lt;ref name=jah /&gt; and its administration was left to Menelik's loyal general, ''Dejazmach'' [[Balcha Safo]]. Balcha Safo's administration of Harar was ineffective, and so during the last illness of Menelik II, and the brief reign of Empress [[Taitu Bitul]], Tafari was made governor of Harar in 1910&lt;ref name=rad712 /&gt; or 1911.&lt;ref name=m387&gt;[[#Mockler|Mockler]], p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August, he married [[Menen Asfaw]] of [[Ambassel]], niece of the heir to the throne [[Lij Iyasu]].

===Regency===
The extent to which Tafari Makonnen contributed to the movement that would come to depose [[Iyasu V]] has been discussed extensively, particularly in Haile Selassie's own detailed account of the matter. Iyasu V, or Lij Iyasu, was the designated but uncrowned emperor of Ethiopia from 1913 to 1916. Iyasu's reputation for scandalous behavior and a disrespectful attitude towards the nobles at the court of his grandfather, Menelik II,&lt;ref&gt;Lentakis, Michael B. (2004), ''Ethiopia: Land of the Lotus Eaters''. Janus Pub. Co. {{ISBN|1-85756558-4}}, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; damaged his reputation. Iyasu's flirtation with Islam was considered treasonous among the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Christian]] leadership of the empire. On 27 September 1916, Iyasu was deposed.&lt;ref name=so228 /&gt;

Contributing to the movement that deposed Iyasu were conservatives such as ''[[Fitawrari]]'' [[Habte Giyorgis]], Menelik II's longtime Minister of War. The movement to depose Iyasu preferred Tafari, as he attracted support from both progressive and conservative factions.  Ultimately, Iyasu was deposed on the grounds of conversion to Islam.&lt;ref name= babylon172 /&gt;&lt;ref name= so228&gt;{{Harvnb |Shinn | p = 228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his place, the daughter of Menelik II (the aunt of Iyasu) was named Empress [[Zewditu]], while Tafari was elevated to the rank of ''Ras'' and was made [[heir apparent]] and [[Crown Prince]]. In the power arrangement that followed, Tafari accepted the role of [[Plenipotentiary|Regent Plenipotentiary]] (''Balemulu 'Inderase'')&lt;ref group=nb&gt;''Bālemulu'' literally means "fully empowered" or "wholly authorised", thus distinguishing it from the general use of ''Enderase'', that being a representative or lieutenant of the Emperor to fiefs or vassals, essentially a [[Governor-General]] or [[Viceroy]], by which term provincial governors in the contemporary Imperial period, during Haile Selassie's reign, were referred.{{Citation needed |date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the ''de facto'' ruler of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] (''Mangista Ityop'p'ya''). Zewditu would govern while Tafari would administer.{{Sfn |Marcus | p = 126}}

[[File:Zewditu and favored priest.png|250px|right|thumb|Empress Zewditu with one of her trusted priests]]
While Iyasu had been deposed on 27 September 1916, on 8 October he managed to escape into the [[Ogaden Desert]] and his father, ''Negus'' [[Mikael of Wollo|Mikael]] of [[Wollo]], had time to come to his aid.&lt;ref name="Marcus, page 127"&gt;{{Harvnb |Marcus | p = 127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 27 October, ''Negus'' Mikael and his army met an army under ''Fitawrari'' Habte Giyorgis loyal to Zewditu and Tafari. During the [[Battle of Segale]], ''Negus'' Mikael was defeated and captured. Any chance that Iyasu would regain the throne was ended and he went into hiding. On 11 January 1921, after avoiding capture for about five years, Iyasu was taken into custody by [[Gugsa Araya Selassie]].

On 11 February 1917, the coronation for Zewditu took place. She pledged to rule justly through her Regent, Tafari. While Tafari was the more visible of the two, Zewditu was far from an honorary ruler. Her position required that she arbitrate the claims of competing factions. In other words, she had the last word. Tafari carried the burden of daily administration but, because his position was relatively weak, this was often an exercise in futility for him.  Initially his personal army was poorly equipped, his finances were limited, and he had little leverage to withstand the combined influence of the Empress, the Minister of War, or the provincial governors.&lt;ref name="Marcus, page 127" /&gt;

During his Regency, the new Crown Prince developed the policy of cautious modernization initiated by Menelik II. Also, during this time, he survived the [[1918 flu pandemic]], having come down with the illness.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Harold (1996), ''Haile Selassie I: The formative years, 1892–1936''.

====Travel abroad====
In 1924, ''Ras'' Tafari toured Europe and the Middle East visiting [[Jerusalem]], [[Alexandria]], Paris, Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], Stockholm, London, [[Geneva]], and [[Athens]]. With him on his tour was a group that included ''Ras'' [[Seyum Mangasha]] of western [[Tigray Province]]; ''Ras'' [[Hailu Tekle Haymanot]] of [[Gojjam]] province; ''Ras'' [[Mulugeta Yeggazu]] of [[Illubabor Province]]; ''Ras'' [[Makonnen Endelkachew]]; and ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Blattengeta]]'' [[Blattengeta Heruy Welde Sellase|Heruy Welde Sellase]].  The primary goal of the trip to Europe was for Ethiopia to gain access to the sea.  In Paris, Tafari was to find out from the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|French Foreign Ministry]] (''[[Quai d'Orsay]]'') that this goal would not be realized.{{Sfn |Marcus | p = 123}}  However, failing this, he and his retinue inspected schools, hospitals, factories, and churches. Although patterning many reforms after European models, Tafari remained wary of European pressure. To guard against [[economic imperialism]], Tafari required that all enterprises have at least partial local ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Gates and Appiah, ''Africana'' (1999), p. 698.&lt;/ref&gt; Of his modernization campaign, he remarked, "We need European progress only because we are surrounded by it. That is at once a benefit and a misfortune."&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Joel Augustus (1936). ''The Real Facts about Ethiopia''. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Tafari's travels in Europe, the [[Levant]], and [[Egypt]], he and his entourage were greeted with enthusiasm and fascination. He was accompanied by Seyum Mangasha and Hailu Tekle Haymanot who, like Tafari, were sons of generals who contributed to the victorious war against Italy a quarter-century earlier at the [[Battle of Adwa]].&lt;ref name=mockler&gt;{{Harvnb |Mockler | pp = 3–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another member of his entourage, Mulugeta Yeggazu, actually fought at Adwa as a young man.

The crown had been taken by [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Robert Napier]] during the [[1868 Expedition to Abyssinia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mockler|Mockler]], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period, the Crown Prince visited the Armenian monastery of [[Jerusalem]]. There, he adopted 40 [[Armenians|Armenian]] orphans (አርባ ልጆች ''[[Arba Lijoch]]'', "forty children"), who had lost their parents in Ottoman massacres. Tafari arranged for the musical education of the youths, and they came to form the imperial brass band.&lt;ref&gt;Nidel, Richard (2005), ''World Music: The Basics''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0415968003}}, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haile Selassie in suit and cloak in 1960s.jpg|thumb|Emperor Haile Selassie standing in front of throne c.1965]]
Tafari's authority was challenged in 1928 when ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Dejazmatch]]'' [[Balcha Safo]] went to Addis Ababa with a sizeable armed force.  When Tafari consolidated his hold over the provinces, many of Menelik's appointees refused to abide by the new regulations. Balcha Safo, the governor (''Shum'') of coffee-rich [[Sidamo Province]], was particularly troublesome. The revenues he remitted to the central government did not reflect the accrued profits and Tafari recalled him to Addis Ababa. The old man came in high dudgeon and, insultingly, with a large army.{{refn |Balcha Safo brought an army of ten thousand with him from Sidamo.&lt;ref name="Marcus, page 127"/&gt; |group= nb}} The ''Dejazmatch'' paid homage to Empress Zewditu, but snubbed Tafari.&lt;ref name= cambridge&gt;{{Harvnb |Roberts | p = 723}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn |Marcus | p = 129}}  On 18 February, while Balcha Safo and his personal bodyguard{{refn |Balcha Safo's personal bodyguard numbered about five hundred.&lt;ref name="Marcus, page 127" /&gt;|group=nb}} were in Addis Ababa, Tafari had ''Ras'' [[Kassa Haile Darge]] buy off his army and arranged to have him displaced as the ''Shum'' of Sidamo Province{{Sfn |Mockler | p = 8}} by Birru Wolde Gabriel who himself was replaced by [[Desta Damtew]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, page 127" /&gt;

Even so, the gesture of Balcha Safo empowered Empress Zewditu politically and she attempted to have Tafari tried for [[treason]]. He was tried for his benevolent dealings with Italy including a [[Italo–Ethiopian Treaty of 1928|20-year peace accord]] which was signed on 2 August.&lt;ref name= so193&gt;{{Harvnb |Shinn | pp = 193–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In September, a group of palace reactionaries including some courtiers of the empress, made a [[Ethiopian coup d'état of 1928|final bid to get rid of Tafari]].  The attempted ''coup d'état'' was tragic in its origins and comic in its end. When confronted by Tafari and a company of his troops, the ringleaders of the coup took refuge on the palace grounds in Menelik's mausoleum.  Tafari and his men surrounded them only to be surrounded themselves by the personal guard of Zewditu.  More of Tafari's khaki clad soldiers arrived and, with superiority of arms, decided the outcome in his favor.{{Sfn |Marcus | pp = 127–28}}  Popular support, as well as the support of the police,&lt;ref name= cambridge /&gt; remained with Tafari. Ultimately, the Empress relented and, on 7 October 1928, she crowned Tafari as ''[[Negus]]'' ([[Amharic]]: "King").

The crowning of Tafari as King was controversial. He occupied the same territory as the empress rather than going off to a regional kingdom of the empire. Two monarchs, even with one being the vassal and the other the emperor (in this case empress), had never occupied the same location as their seat in [[Ethiopian history]].  Conservatives agitated to redress this perceived insult to the dignity of the crown, leading to the [[Gugsa Welle's Rebellion (1930)|rebellion of ''Ras'' Gugsa Welle]]. [[Gugsa Welle]] was the husband of the empress and the ''Shum'' of [[Begemder]] Province. In early 1930, he raised an army and marched it from his governorate at [[Gondar]] towards [[Addis Ababa]].

Red Sea Press. {{ISBN|1569020515}}, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution limited the succession to the throne to the descendants of Haile Selassie, a point that met with the disapprobation of other dynastic princes, including the princes of [[Tigray Province|Tigrai]] and even the emperor's loyal cousin, Ras [[Kassa Haile Darge]].

In 1932, the [[Kingdom of Jimma|Sultanate of Jimma]] was formally absorbed into Ethiopia following the death of Sultan [[Abba Jifar II]] of [[Jimma]].

===Conflict with Italy===
{{See also|Abyssinia Crisis|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}
Ethiopia became the target of renewed Italian imperialist designs in the 1930s. [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Fascist]] regime was keen to avenge the military defeats Italy had suffered to Ethiopia in the [[First Italo-Abyssinian War]], and to efface the failed attempt by "liberal" Italy to conquer the country, as epitomised by the defeat at [[Battle of Adwa|Adwa]].{{Sfn |Mockler | p = 61}}&lt;ref name=carlton&gt;Carlton, Eric (1992), ''Occupation: The Policies and Practices of Military Conquerors''.

Ethiopia's position in the League of Nations did not dissuade the Italians from invading in 1935; the "[[collective security]]" envisaged by the League proved useless, and a scandal erupted when the [[Hoare-Laval Pact]] revealed that Ethiopia's League allies were scheming to appease Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston (1986). ''The Second World War''. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mobilization====
Following the 5 December 1934 Italian invasion of Ethiopia at Welwel, Ogaden Province, Haile Selassie joined his northern armies and set up headquarters at [[Dessie|Desse]] in [[Wollo]] province. He issued his mobilization order on 3 October 1935:
{{Quote |If you withhold from your country Ethiopia the death from cough or head-cold of which you would otherwise die, refusing to resist (in your district, in your patrimony, and in your home) our enemy who is coming from a distant country to attack us, and if you persist in not shedding your blood, you will be rebuked for it by your Creator and will be cursed by your offspring. Hence, without cooling your heart of accustomed valour, there emerges your decision to fight fiercely, mindful of your history that will last far into the future…  If on your march you touch any property inside houses or cattle and crops outside, not even grass, straw, and dung excluded, it is like killing your brother who is dying with you…  You, countryman, living at the various access routes, set up a market for the army at the places where it is camping and on the day your district-governor will indicate to you, lest the soldiers campaigning for Ethiopia's liberty should experience difficulty. You will not be charged excise duty, until the end of the campaign, for anything you are marketing at the military camps: I have granted you remission…  After you have been ordered to go to war, but are then idly missing from the campaign, and when you are seized by the local chief or by an accuser, you will have punishment inflicted upon your inherited land, your property, and your body; to the accuser I shall grant a third of your property…}}

On 19 October 1935, Haile Selassie gave more precise orders for his army to his Commander-in-Chief, Ras [[Kassa Haile Darge|Kassa]]:
{{Quote |
# When you set up tents, it is to be in caves and by trees and in a wood, if the place happens to be adjoining to these―and separated in the various platoons. Tents are to be set up at a distance of 30 cubits from each other.
# When an aeroplane is sighted, one should leave large open roads and wide meadows and march in valleys and trenches and by zigzag routes, along places which have trees and woods.
# When an aeroplane comes to drop bombs, it will not suit it to do so unless it comes down to about 100 metres; hence when it flies low for such action, one should fire a volley with a good and very long gun and then quickly disperse. When three or four bullets have hit it, the aeroplane is bound to fall down. But let only those fire who have been ordered to shoot with a weapon that has been selected for such firing, for if everyone shoots who possesses a gun, there is no advantage in this except to waste bullets and to disclose the men's whereabouts.
# Lest the aeroplane, when rising again, should detect the whereabouts of those who are dispersed, it is well to remain cautiously scattered as long as it is still fairly close. In time of war it suits the enemy to aim his guns at adorned shields, ornaments, silver and gold cloaks, silk shirts and all similar things. Whether one possesses a jacket or not, it is best to wear a narrow-sleeved shirt with faded colours. When we return, with God's help, you can wear your gold and silver decorations then. Now it is time to go and fight. We offer you all these words of advice in the hope that no great harm should befall you through lack of caution.  At the same time, We are glad to assure you that in time of war. We are ready to shed Our blood in your midst for the sake of Ethiopia's freedom…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jah-rastafari.com/autobiography/show-jah-chapter.asp?word_chapter=35 |title=Chapter 35 – We proclaim mobilization |accessdate=2014-04-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611043703/http://www.jah-rastafari.com/autobiography/show-jah-chapter.asp?word_chapter=35 |archivedate=11 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }} in ''Words of RasTafarI, Haile Selassie I''.

Compared to the Ethiopians, the Italians had an advanced, modern military which included a large air force. The Italians would also come to employ [[chemical weapons]] extensively throughout the conflict, even targeting [[Red Cross]] field hospitals in violation of the [[Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref&gt;Baudendistel, Rainer (2006), ''Between Bombs And Good Intentions: The Red Cross And the Italo-Ethiopian War''. Berghahn Books. {{ISBN|1-84545035-3}}, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Progress of the war====
Starting in early October 1935, the [[De Bono's invasion of Abyssinia|Italians invaded Ethiopia]]. But, by November, the pace of invasion had slowed appreciably and Haile Selassie's northern armies were able to launch what was known as the "[[Ethiopian Christmas Offensive|Christmas Offensive]]". During this offensive, the Italians were forced back in places and put on the defensive.  In early 1936, the [[First Battle of Tembien]] stopped the progress of the Ethiopian offensive and the Italians were ready to continue their offensive. Following the defeat and destruction of the northern Ethiopian armies at the [[Battle of Amba Aradam]], the [[Second Battle of Tembien]], and the [[Battle of Shire]], Haile Selassie took the field with the last Ethiopian army on the northern front. On 31 March 1936, he launched a [[counterattack]] against the Italians himself at the [[Battle of Maychew]] in southern [[Tigray Province|Tigray]]. The emperor's army was defeated and retreated in disarray. As Haile Selassie's army withdrew, the Italians attacked from the air along with rebellious Raya and Azebo tribesmen on the ground, who were armed and paid by the Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Young, John (1997), ''Peasant Revolution in Ethiopia''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-52102606-7}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bete Giyorgis Lalibela Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|250px|left|When the struggle to resist Italy appeared doomed, Haile Selassie traveled to the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela for fasting and prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Garvey, Marcus, ''The Marcus Garvey and Universal Negro Improvement Association Papers''. 1991, p. 685.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Haile Selassie made a solitary [[pilgrimage]] to the churches at [[Lalibela]], at considerable risk of capture, before returning to his capital.&lt;ref name= moc&gt;{{Harvnb |Mockler | p = 123}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After a stormy session of the council of state, it was agreed that because [[Addis Ababa]] could not be defended, the government would relocate to the southern town of [[Gore, Ethiopia|Gore]], and that in the interest of preserving the Imperial house, the emperor's wife [[Menen Asfaw]] and the rest of the imperial family should immediately depart for [[French Somaliland]], and from there continue on to [[Jerusalem]].

====Exile debate====
[[File:SelassieInJerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|The emperor arrives in Jerusalem. May 1936]]
After further debate as to whether Haile Selassie should go to Gore or accompany his family into exile, it was agreed that he should leave Ethiopia with his family and present the case of Ethiopia to the [[League of Nations]] at [[Geneva]]. The decision was not unanimous and several participants, including the nobleman [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Blatta]] [[Tekle Wolde Hawariat]], strenuously objected to the idea of an Ethiopian monarch fleeing before an invading force.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, John (2006). ''Ethiopia at Bay: A Personal Account of the Haile Selassie Years''. Tsehai Publishers. {{ISBN|1-59907000-6}}. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Haile Selassie appointed his cousin Ras [[Imru Haile Selassie]] as Prince Regent in his absence, departing with his family for [[French Somaliland]] on 2 May 1936.

On 5 May, Marshal [[Pietro Badoglio]] led Italian troops into Addis Ababa, and Mussolini declared Ethiopia an Italian province. [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emanuel III]] was proclaimed as the new [[Emperor of Ethiopia]]. On the previous day, the Ethiopian exiles had left French Somaliland aboard the British cruiser [[HMS Enterprise (D52)|HMS ''Enterprise'']]. They were bound for [[Jerusalem]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], where the Ethiopian royal family maintained a residence. The Imperial family disembarked at [[Haifa]] and then went on to Jerusalem. Once there, Haile Selassie and his retinue prepared to make their case at Geneva. The choice of Jerusalem was highly symbolic, since the [[Solomonic Dynasty]] claimed descent from the [[Davidic line|House of David]]. Leaving the [[Holy Land]], Haile Selassie and his entourage sailed aboard the British cruiser [[HMS Capetown (D88)|HMS ''Capetown'']] for [[Gibraltar]], where he stayed at the [[Rock Hotel]]. From Gibraltar, the exiles were transferred to an ordinary liner. By doing this, the government of the United Kingdom was spared the expense of a state reception.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. J. (1936), ''The Rape of Ethiopia'', p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collective security and the League of Nations, 1936====
Mussolini, upon invading Ethiopia, had promptly declared his own "[[Italian Empire]]." Because the League of Nations afforded Haile Selassie the opportunity to address the assembly, Italy even withdrew its League delegation, on 12 May 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, John (2006). ''Ethiopia at Bay: A Personal Account of the Haile Selassie Years''. Tsehai Publishers. {{ISBN|1-59907000-6}}. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this context that Haile Selassie walked into the hall of the League of Nations, introduced by the President of the Assembly as "His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Ethiopia" (''Sa Majesté Imperiale, l'Empereur d'Ethiopie''). The introduction caused a great many Italian journalists in the galleries to erupt into jeering, heckling, and whistling. As it turned out, they had earlier been issued whistles by Mussolini's son-in-law, Count [[Galeazzo Ciano]].&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, Ray (1999), ''Mussolini's Shadow: The Double Life of Count Galeazzo Ciano''. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-30007917-6}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian delegate, [[Nicolae Titulescu]], famously jumped to his feet in response and cried "To the door with the savages!", and the offending journalists were removed from the hall. Haile Selassie waited calmly for the hall to be cleared, and responded "majestically"&lt;ref&gt;[[Delia Jarrett-Macauley|Jarrett-Macauley, Delia]] (1998), ''The Life of Una Marson, 1905–65'', Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0-71905284-X}}, pp. 102–3.&lt;/ref&gt; with a speech sometimes considered{{By whom |date=August 2016}} among the most stirring of the 20th century.{{Sfn | Safire | 1997 | pp = 297–8}}

Although fluent in French, the working language of the League, Haile Selassie chose to deliver his historic speech in his native [[Amharic]]. He asserted that, because his "confidence in the League was absolute", his people were now being slaughtered. He pointed out that the same European states that found in Ethiopia's favor at the League of Nations were refusing Ethiopia credit and [[matériel]] while aiding Italy, which was employing chemical weapons on military and civilian targets alike.
{{Quote |It was at the time when the operations for the encircling of [[Mek'ele|Makale]] were taking place that the Italian command, fearing a rout, followed the procedure which it is now my duty to denounce to the world. Special sprayers were installed on board aircraft so that they could vaporize, over vast areas of territory, a fine, death-dealing rain. Groups of nine, fifteen, eighteen aircraft followed one another so that the fog issuing from them formed a continuous sheet. It was thus that, as from the end of January 1936, soldiers, women, children, cattle, rivers, lakes, and pastures were drenched continually with this deadly rain.  In order to kill off systematically all living creatures, in order to more surely poison waters and pastures, the Italian command made its aircraft pass over and over again. That was its chief method of warfare.{{Sfn | Safire | 1997 | p = 318}}}}

Noting that his own "small people of 12 million inhabitants, without arms, without resources" could never withstand an attack by a large power such as Italy, with its 42&amp;nbsp;million people and "unlimited quantities of the most death-dealing weapons", he contended that all small states were threatened by the aggression, and that all small states were in effect reduced to [[vassal state]]s in the absence of collective action. He admonished the League that "God and history will remember your judgment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Ferraro | first = Vincent |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/selassie.htm |title=Haile Selassie, "Appeal to the League of Nations", June 1936 |publisher=Mtholyoke |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote |It is collective security: it is the very existence of the League of Nations. It is the confidence that each State is to place in international treaties…  In a word, it is international morality that is at stake. Have the signatures appended to a Treaty value only in so far as the signatory Powers have a personal, direct and immediate interest involved?}}

The speech made the emperor an icon for anti-fascists around the world, and ''Time'' named him "Man of the Year".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19360106,00.html | newspaper = Time | type = magazine | title = Man of the Year | date = 6 January 1936}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He failed, however, to get what he most needed: the League agreed to only partial and ineffective sanctions on Italy. Only six nations in 1937 did not recognize Italy's occupation: China, New Zealand, the Soviet Union, the Republic of Spain, Mexico and the United States.&lt;ref name=carlton /&gt;

====Exile====

[[File:Addis Ababa-8e00855u.jpg|thumb|right|Haile Selassie in 1942]]
Haile Selassie spent his exile years (1936–41) in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, in [[Fairfield House, Bath|Fairfield House]], which he bought. The emperor and [[''Ras'' Kassa|Kassa Haile Darge]] took morning walks together behind the high walls of the 14-room Georgian house. Haile Selassie's favorite reading was "diplomatic history." But most of his serious hours were occupied with the 90,000-word story of his life that he was laboriously writing in Amharic.{{Sfn | Time | 1937}}

Prior to Fairfield House, he briefly stayed at Warne's Hotel in [[Worthing]]&lt;ref name="Worthing"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elleray|first=D.

Haile Selassie stayed at the Abbey Hotel in [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] in the 1930s and his granddaughters and daughters of court officials were educated at Clarendon School in [[North Malvern]]. During his time in Malvern he attended services at Holy Trinity Church, in [[Link Top]]. A [[blue plaque]], commemorating his stay in Malvern, was unveiled on Saturday, 25 June 2011.

Haile Selassie's activity in this period was focused on countering Italian propaganda as to the state of Ethiopian resistance and the legality of the occupation.{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, pp. 11–2.}}  He spoke out against the desecration of houses of worship and historical artifacts (including the theft of a 1,600-year-old imperial obelisk), and condemned the atrocities suffered by the Ethiopian civilian population.{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, pp. 26–27.}}  He continued to plead for League intervention and to voice his certainty that "God's judgment will eventually visit the weak and the mighty alike",&lt;ref name= progress25 /&gt; though his attempts to gain support for the struggle against Italy were largely unsuccessful until Italy entered World War II on the German side in June 1940.&lt;ref name= ofcan&gt;Ofcansky, Thomas P. and Berry, Laverle (2004), ''Ethiopia: A Country Study''.  Kessinger Publishing.  {{ISBN|1-41911857-9}}, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emperor's pleas for international support did take root in the United States, particularly among African-American organizations sympathetic to the Ethiopian cause.{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, p. 27}}  In 1937, Haile Selassie was to give a Christmas Day radio address to the American people to thank his supporters when his taxi was involved in a traffic accident, leaving him with a fractured knee.{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, pp. 40–42}}  Rather than canceling the radio broadcast, he proceeded in much pain to complete the address, in which he linked Christianity and goodwill with the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]], and asserted that "War is not the only means to stop war":{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, pp. 40–42}}
{{Quote |
With the birth of the Son of God, an unprecedented, an unrepeatable, and a long-anticipated phenomenon occurred. He was born in a stable instead of a palace, in a manger instead of a crib. The hearts of the Wise men were struck by fear and wonder due to His Majestic Humbleness. The kings prostrated themselves before Him and worshipped Him. 'Peace be to those who have good will'. This became the first message.

...Although the toils of wise people may earn them respect, it is a fact of life that the spirit of the wicked continues to cast its shadow on this world. The arrogant are seen visibly leading their people into crime and destruction. The laws of the League of Nations are constantly violated and wars and acts of aggression repeatedly take place…  So that the spirit of the cursed will not gain predominance over the human race whom Christ redeemed with his blood, all peace-loving people should cooperate to stand firm in order to preserve and promote lawfulness and peace.{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, pp. 40–42}}}}

During this period, Haile Selassie suffered several personal tragedies. His two sons-in-law, Ras [[Desta Damtew]] and Dejazmach [[Beyene Merid]], were both executed by the Italians.&lt;ref name=progress25&gt;{{Harvnb | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, p. 25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor's daughter, Princess [[Romanework]], wife of Dejazmach Beyene Merid, was herself taken into captivity with her children, and she died in Italy in 1941.&lt;ref name=him170&gt;{{Harvnb | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, p. 170}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Tsehai died during childbirth shortly after the restoration in 1942.{{Sfn |Shinn | p = 3}}

British forces, which consisted primarily of Ethiopian-backed African and South African colonial troops under the "[[Gideon Force]]" of Colonel [[Orde Wingate]], coordinated the military effort to liberate Ethiopia. The emperor himself issued several imperial proclamations in this period, demonstrating that, while authority was not divided up in any formal way, British military might and the emperor's populist appeal could be joined in the concerted effort to liberate Ethiopia.&lt;ref name= ofcan /&gt;

On 18 January 1941, during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], Haile Selassie crossed the border between [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]] near the village of Um Iddla. The standard of the [[Lion of Judah]] was raised again. Two days later, he and a force of Ethiopian patriots joined [[Gideon Force]] which was already in Ethiopia and preparing the way.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. J. (1936), ''The Rape of Ethiopia'', p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was defeated by a force of the United Kingdom, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Free French Forces|Free France]], [[Free Belgian Forces|Free Belgium]], and Ethiopian patriots. On 5 May 1941, Haile Selassie entered [[Addis Ababa]] and personally addressed the Ethiopian people, five years to the day since his 1936 exile:
{{Quote |
Today is the day on which we defeated our enemy. Therefore, when we say let us rejoice with our hearts, let not our rejoicing be in any other way but in the spirit of Christ. Do not return evil for evil. Do not indulge in the atrocities which the enemy has been practicing in his usual way, even to the last.

Take care not to spoil the good name of Ethiopia by acts which are worthy of the enemy. We shall see that our enemies are disarmed and sent out the same way they came. As Saint George who killed the dragon is the Patron Saint of our army as well as of our allies, let us unite with our allies in everlasting friendship and amity in order to be able to stand against the godless and cruel dragon which has newly risen and which is oppressing mankind.{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, p. 165}}}}

On 27 August 1942, Haile Selassie confirmed the legal basis for the abolition of [[African slave trade|slavery]] that had been enacted by Italy throughout the empire and imposed severe penalties, including death, for slave trading.&lt;ref&gt;Hinks, Peter P.; McKivigan, John R. and Williams, R.

In 1948, the [[Ogaden]], a region disputed with [[Somalia]], was granted to Ethiopia.{{Sfn |Shinn | p = 201}}  On 2 December 1950, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 390 (V), establishing the federation of [[Eritrea]] (the former Italian colony) into Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=shinn141&gt;[[#Shinn|Shinn]], pp. 140–1.&lt;/ref&gt; Eritrea was to have its own constitution, which would provide for ethnic, linguistic, and cultural balance, while Ethiopia was to manage its finances, defense, and foreign policy.&lt;ref name=shinn141 /&gt;

Despite his centralization policies that had been made before World War II, Haile Selassie still found himself unable to push for all the programs he wanted. In 1942, he attempted to institute a progressive tax scheme, but this failed due to opposition from the nobility, and only a flat tax was passed; in 1951, he agreed to reduce this as well.&lt;ref name=eth&gt;Ofcansky, Thomas P. and Berry, Laverle (2004).

Between 1941 and 1959, Haile Selassie worked to establish the [[autocephaly]] of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]].&lt;ref name=copts&gt;Watson, John H. (2000), ''Among the Copts''. Sussex Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-1-902210-56-8}}, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopian Orthodox Church had been headed by the ''[[abuna]]'', a bishop who answered to the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. In 1942 and 1945 Haile Selassie applied to the [[Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church]] to establish the independence of Ethiopian bishops, and when his appeals were denied he threatened to sever relations with the Coptic Church of Alexandria.&lt;ref name=copts /&gt; Finally, in 1959, [[Pope Kyrillos VI]] elevated the Abuna to Patriarch-Catholicos.&lt;ref name=copts /&gt; The Ethiopian Church remained affiliated with the Alexandrian Church.&lt;ref name=eth /&gt; In addition to these efforts, Haile Selassie changed the Ethiopian church-state relationship by introducing taxation of church lands, and by restricting the legal privileges of the clergy, who had formerly been tried in their own courts for civil offenses.&lt;ref name=eth /&gt;

In keeping with the principle of [[collective security]], for which he was an outspoken proponent, he sent a contingent under General Mulugueta Bulli, known as the [[Kagnew Battalion]], to take part in the [[Korean War]] by supporting the [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations Command]]. It was attached to the American [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]], and fought in a number of engagements including the [[Battle of Pork Chop Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.geocities.com/lmak27455/Ethiopian_Korean_War_Veterans/help.html | title = Ethiopian Korean War Veterans | publisher = Yahoo! | work = Geo cities | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/lmak27455/Ethiopian_Korean_War_Veterans/help.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:54:23 | archivedate = 26 October 2009 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1954 speech, the emperor spoke of Ethiopian participation in the [[Korean War]] as a redemption of the principles of collective security:
{{Quote |Nearly two decades ago, I personally assumed before history the responsibility of placing the fate of my beloved people on the issue of collective security, for surely, at that time and for the first time in world history, that issue was posed in all its clarity. My searching of conscience convinced me of the rightness of my course and if, after untold sufferings and, indeed, unaided resistance at the time of aggression, we now see the final vindication of that principle in our joint action in Korea, I can only be thankful that God gave me strength to persist in our faith until the moment of its recent glorious vindication.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel, Ras (2004), ''50th Anniversary of His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I''.

[[File:Image HaileSelassieIthefirst.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia, photographed during a radio broadcast]]
During the celebrations of his Silver Jubilee in November 1955, Haile Selassie introduced a [[1955 Constitution of Ethiopia|revised constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.country-studies.com/ethiopia/administrative-change-and-the-1955-constitution.html |title=Ethiopia Administrative Change and the 1955 Constitution |publisher= Country studies |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby he retained effective power, while extending political participation to the people by allowing the lower house of parliament to become an elected body.  Party politics were not provided for. Modern educational methods were more widely spread throughout the Empire, and the country embarked on a development scheme and plans for modernization, tempered by Ethiopian traditions, and within the framework of the ancient monarchical structure of the state.

Haile Selassie compromised when practical with the traditionalists in the nobility and church. He also tried to improve relations between the state and ethnic groups, and granted autonomy to [[Afar people|Afar]] lands that were difficult to control. Still, his reforms to end feudalism were slow and weakened by the compromises he made with the entrenched aristocracy.  The Revised Constitution of 1955 has been criticized for reasserting "the indisputable power of the monarch" and maintaining the relative powerlessness of the peasants.&lt;ref name=mammo /&gt;

Haile Selassie also maintained cordial relations with the government of the [[United Kingdom]] through charitable gestures.  He sent aid to the British government in 1947 when Britain was affected by heavy flooding. His letter to Lord Meork, National Distress Fund, London said, "even though We are busy of helping our people who didn't recover from the crises of the war, We heard that your fertile and beautiful country is devastated by the unusually heavy rain, and your request for aid. Therefore, We are sending small amount of money, about one thousand pounds through our embassy to show our sympathy and cooperation."&lt;ref&gt;''Addis Zemen'' newspaper, 3 October 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; He also left his home in exile, [[Fairfield House, Bath]], to the City of Bath for the use of the aged in 1959.

Haile Selassie contributed Ethiopian troops to the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] peacekeeping force during the 1960 [[Congo Crisis]], to preserve Congolese integrity, per [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 143]]. On 13 December 1960, while Haile Selassie was on a state visit to [[Brazil]], his Imperial Guard forces staged [[1960 Ethiopian coup|an unsuccessful coup]], briefly proclaiming Haile Selassie's eldest son [[Amha Selassie|Asfa Wossen]] as emperor. The coup d'état was crushed by the regular army and police forces. The coup attempt lacked broad popular support, was denounced by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], and was unpopular with the army, [[Ethiopian Air Force|air force]] and police. Nonetheless, the effort to depose the emperor had support among students and the educated classes.&lt;ref name=zewde&gt;Zewde, Bahru (2001), ''A History of Modern Ethiopia''. Oxford: James Currey. {{ISBN|0852557868}}, pp. 220–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The coup attempt has been characterized as a pivotal moment in Ethiopian history, the point at which Ethiopians "for the first time questioned the power of the king to rule without the people's consent".&lt;ref name=mammo100&gt;Mammo, Tirfe (1999), ''The Paradox of Africa's Poverty: The Role of Indigenous Knowledge.''The Red Sea Press. {{ISBN|1569020493}}, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Student populations began to empathize with the peasantry and poor, and to advocate on their behalf.&lt;ref name=mammo100 /&gt; The coup spurred Haile Selassie to accelerate reform, which was manifested in the form of land grants to military and police officials.

The emperor continued to be a staunch ally of the West, while pursuing a firm policy of [[decolonization]] in Africa, which was still largely under European colonial rule. The United Nations conducted a lengthy inquiry regarding the status of Eritrea, with the superpowers each vying for a stake in the state's future. Britain, the administrator at the time, suggested the partition of Eritrea between Sudan and Ethiopia, separating Christians and Muslims. The idea was instantly rejected by Eritrean political parties, as well as the UN.

A UN plebiscite voted 46 to 10 to have Eritrea be [[federation|federated]] with Ethiopia, which was later stipulated on 2 December 1950 in resolution 390 (V). Eritrea would have its own parliament and administration and would be represented in what had been the Ethiopian parliament and would become the federal parliament.&lt;ref name="UN_GA_res-5"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/5/ares5.htm |title=General Assembly Resolutions 5th Session |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haile Selassie would have none of European attempts to draft a separate Constitution under which Eritrea would be governed, and wanted his own 1955 Constitution protecting families to apply in both Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 1961 the 30-year [[Eritrean War for Independence|Eritrean Struggle for Independence]] began, followed by Haile Selassie's dissolution of the federation and shutting down of Eritrea's parliament.
[[File:Selassie_and_Nasser,_1963.jpg|thumb|Emperor Haile Selassie with President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Egypt]] in Addis Ababa for the [[Organisation of African Unity]] summit, 1963.]]
In September 1961, Haile Selassie attended the Conference of Heads of State of Government of Non-Aligned Countries in [[Belgrade]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]]. This is considered to be the founding conference of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

In 1961, tensions between independence-minded Eritreans and Ethiopian forces culminated in the Eritrean War of Independence. The emperor declared Eritrea the fourteenth province of Ethiopia in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Haile, Semere (1987), "The Origins and Demise of the Ethiopia-Eritrea Federation", ''Issue: A Journal of Opinion'', 15, pp. 9–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The war would continue for 30 years, as first Haile Selassie, then the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed junta that succeeded him, attempted to retain Eritrea by force.

In 1963, Haile Selassie presided over the formation of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), the precursor of the continent-wide [[African Union]] (AU). The new organization would establish its headquarters in [[Addis Ababa]]. In May of that year, Haile Selassie was elected as the OAU's first official chairperson, a rotating seat. Along with [[Modibo Keïta]] of Mali, the Ethiopian leader would later help successfully negotiate the Bamako Accords, which brought an end to the border conflict between [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]].  In 1964, Haile Selassie would initiate the concept of the [[United States of Africa]], a proposition later taken up by [[Muammar Gaddafi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jimmatimes.com/article/Latest_News/Latest_News/Ethiopia_New_African_un1on_Building_and_Kwame_Statue_Video/34060 |title="Ethiopia: New African Union Building and Kwame Statue" (Video) |accessdate=2014-04-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615065602/http://jimmatimes.com/article/Latest_News/Latest_News/Ethiopia_New_African_un1on_Building_and_Kwame_Statue_Video/34060 |archivedate=15 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}.  ''Jimma Times''.  29 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 1963, Haile Selassie addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, Sam Pope (5 October 1963), [https://www.nytimes.com/1963/10/05/archives/selassie-at-un-recalls-1936-plea-to-league-says-equality-of-all-is.html Selassie, at U.N., Recalls 1936 Plea to League], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.unmultimedia.org/s/photo/detail/844/0084497.html | work = Emperor of Ethiopia Addresses General Assembly | title = Photo # 84497 | publisher = United Nations | place = New York | date = 4 October 1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt; referring in his address to his earlier speech to the League of Nations:
{{Quote |Twenty-seven years ago, as Emperor of Ethiopia, I mounted the rostrum in Geneva, Switzerland, to address the League of Nations and to appeal for relief from the destruction which had been unleashed against my defenceless nation, by the fascist invader. I spoke then both to and for the conscience of the world. My words went unheeded, but history testifies to the accuracy of the warning that I gave in 1936. Today, I stand before the world organization which has succeeded to the mantle discarded by its discredited predecessor. In this body is enshrined the principle of collective security which I unsuccessfully invoked at Geneva. Here, in this Assembly, reposes the best – perhaps the last – hope for the peaceful survival of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Selassie's Address to the United Nations]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 25 November 1963, the emperor was among other [[heads of state]], including France's President [[Charles de Gaulle]], who traveled to Washington D.C. and attended the [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|funeral of assassinated President John F. Kennedy]].

In 1966, Haile Selassie attempted to create a modern, progressive tax{{Citation needed |date= May 2008}} that included registration of land, which would significantly weaken the nobility.  Even with alterations, this law led to a revolt in Gojjam, which was repressed although enforcement of the tax was abandoned.  The revolt, having achieved its design in undermining the tax, encouraged other landowners to defy Haile Selassie.
[[File:Haile Selassie 1963.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Haile Selassie on a state visit to Washington, 1963]]

While he had fully approved and assured Ethiopia's participation in UN-approved collective security operations, including Korea and Congo, Haile Selassie drew a distinction between it and the non-UN-approved foreign intervention in Indochina, consistently deploring it as needless suffering and calling for the Vietnam War to end on several occasions. At the same time he remained open toward the United States and commended it for making progress with African Americans' Civil Rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s, while visiting the US several times during these years.

In 1967, he visited Montreal, Canada to open the Ethiopian Pavilion at the Expo '67 World's Fair where he received great acclaim amongst other World leaders there for the occasion.

Student unrest became a regular feature of Ethiopian life in the 1960s and 1970s. [[Marxism]] took root in large segments of the Ethiopian intelligentsia, particularly among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and left-wing sentiments that were becoming popular in other parts of the globe.&lt;ref name=zewde /&gt; Resistance by conservative elements at the Imperial Court and Parliament, and by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, made Haile Selassie's land reform proposals difficult to implement, and also damaged the standing of the government, costing Haile Selassie much of the goodwill he had once enjoyed. This bred resentment among the peasant population. Efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image. As these issues began to pile up, Haile Selassie left much of domestic governance to his Prime Minister, [[Aklilu Habte-Wold|Aklilu Habte Wold]], and concentrated more on foreign affairs.

===1970s===
[[File:El emperador de Etiopia Haile Selassie I visita Toledo en abril de 1971. Fotografía de Eduardo Butragueño Bueno.jpg|thumb|Haile Selassie I in Toledo (Spain) in April 1971. Picture by Eduardo Butragueño.]]
Outside of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie continued to enjoy enormous prestige and respect. As the longest-serving head of state in power, he was often given precedence over other leaders at state events, such as the [[state funeral]]s of [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]] and [[Charles de Gaulle]], the summits of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and the [[2,500 year celebration of Iran's monarchy|1971 celebration]] of the 2,500 years of the [[History of Iran|Persian Empire]]. In 1970 he visited Italy as a guest of President [[Giuseppe Saragat]], and in [[Milan]] he met [[Giordano Dell'Amore]], President of Italian Savings Banks Association.  He visited China in October 1971, and was the first foreign head of state to meet [[Mao Zedong]] following the death of Mao's designated successor [[Lin Biao]] in a plane crash in Mongolia.

Human rights in Ethiopia under Selassie's regime were poor. Civil liberties and political rights were low with [[Freedom House]] giving Ethiopia a "Not Free" score for both civil liberties and political rights in the last years of Selassie's rule.&lt;ref name="FH1972"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW%20All%20Scores%2C%20Countries%2C%201973-2012%20%28FINAL%29.xls | title = Country ratings and status, FIW 1973–2012 | accessdate = 2012-08-22 | publisher = [[Freedom House]] | year = 2012 | format = XLS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common human right abuses included imprisonment and torture of political prisoners and very poor prison conditions.&lt;ref name="Feeding on Ethiopia's Famine" /&gt; The Ethiopian army also carried out a number of these atrocities while fighting the Eritrean separatists.

Against that background, a group of dissident army officers instigated a creeping coup against the emperor's faltering regime.  To guard against a public backlash in favour of Haile Selassie (who was still widely revered), they contrived to obtain a copy of ''The Unknown Famine'' which they intercut with images of Africa's grand old man presiding at a wedding feast in the grounds of his palace. Retitled ''The Hidden Hunger'', this [[film noir]] was shown round the clock on Ethiopian television to coincide with the day that they finally summoned the nerve to seize the emperor himself.

The crisis was exacerbated by military mutinies and high [[oil prices]], the latter a result of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The international economic crisis triggered by the oil crisis caused the costs of imported goods, gasoline, and food to skyrocket, while unemployment spiked.&lt;ref name=mammo /&gt;

====Revolution====
In February 1974, four days of serious riots in Addis Ababa against a sudden economic inflation left five dead. The emperor responded by announcing on national television a reduction in petrol prices and a freeze on the cost of basic commodities. This calmed the public, but the promised 33% military wage hike was not substantial enough to pacify the army, which then mutinied, beginning in Asmara and spreading throughout the empire. This mutiny led to the resignation of Prime Minister [[Aklilu Habte-Wold]] on 27 February 1974.&lt;ref name=evang&gt;Launhardt, Johannes (2005). ''Evangelicals in Addis Ababa (1919–1991)''. LIT Verlag. {{ISBN|3-82587791-4}}, pp. 239–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Haile Selassie again went on television to agree to the army's demands for still greater pay, and named [[Endelkachew Makonnen]] as his new Prime Minister. Despite Endalkatchew's many concessions, discontent continued in March with a four-day general strike that paralyzed the nation.

====Imprisonment====

The [[Derg]], a committee of low-ranking military officers and enlisted men, set up in June to investigate the military's demands, took advantage of the government's disarray to depose the 82-year-old Selassie on {{nowrap|September 12.&lt;ref name=qceros&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dDRWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4ucDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6032%2C2832764|work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon)|agency=Associated Press |title=Quiet coup ends reign of Selassie |date=September 12, 1974 |page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} General [[Aman Andom|Aman Mikael Andom]], a Protestant of Eritrean origin,&lt;ref name= evang /&gt; served briefly as provisional head of state pending the return of Crown Prince Asfa Wossen, who was then receiving medical treatment abroad.

Later, most of the imperial family was imprisoned in the Addis Ababa prison Kerchele, also known as "[[Alem Bekagne]]," or "I've had Enough of This World."

====Death and interment====
On 28 August 1975, the state media reported that the "ex-monarch" Haile Selassie had died on 27 August of "respiratory failure" following complications from a prostate examination followed up by a prostate operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Haile Selassie of Ethiopia Dies at 83 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0723.html |quote=Haile Selassie, the last emperor in the 3,000-year-old Ethiopian monarchy, who ruled for half a century before he was deposed in a military coup last September, died yesterday in a small apartment in his former palace.

Although such prominent Rastafari figures as [[Rita Marley]] and others participated in the grand funeral, most Rastafari rejected the event and refused to accept that the bones were the remains of Haile Selassie. There remains some debate within the [[Rastafari movement]] whether Haile Selassie actually died in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Ennis Barrington (2002), ''Rastafari: From Outcasts to Culture Bearers''.

==Descendants==
[[File:SelassiesSon.jpg|thumb|[[Prince Makonnen]], son of Haile Selassie I.]]
By [[Menen Asfaw]], Haile Selassie had six children: [[Princess Tenagnework]], [[Crown Prince]] [[Amha Selassie|Asfaw Wossen]], [[Princess Zenebework]], [[Princess Tsehai]], [[Prince Makonnen]], and [[Prince Sahle Selassie]].

There is some controversy as to the motherhood of Haile Selassie's eldest daughter, [[Princess Romanework]]. While the living members of the royal family state that Romanework is the eldest daughter of Empress Menen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afronord.tripod.com/him/page8.html |title=Granddaughter Esther Selassie's website genealogy |publisher=Afronord.tripod.com |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been asserted that Princess Romanework is actually the daughter of a previous union of the emperor with Woizero Altayech.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mockler|Mockler]], p. xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a nickname she used, as nobleman Blata Merse Hazen Wolde Kirkos, a contemporary source prominent in both the Imperial Court and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] names her as Woizero Woinetu Amede. The emperor's own autobiography makes no mention of this previous marriage or having fathered children with anyone other than Empress Menen, although he mentions the death of this daughter in captivity at Turin.  Other sources such as Blata Merse Hazen Wolde Kirkos mentions Princess Romanework's mother Woizero Woinetu Amede as attending the wedding of her daughter to Dejazmatch Beyene Merid in a first hand account in his book about the years before the Italian occupation.

Prince Asfaw Wossen was first married to Princess [[Wolete Israel Seyoum]] and then following their divorce to Princess [[Medferiashwork Abebe]]. Prince Makonnen was married to Princess [[Sara Gizaw]]. Prince Sahle Selassie was married to Princess [[Mahisente Habte Mariam]]. Princess Romanework married Dejazmatch Beyene Merid. Princess Tenagnework first married Ras [[Desta Damtew]], and after she was widowed later married Ras [[Andargachew Messai]]. Princess Zenebework married Dejazmatch [[Haile Selassie Gugsa]]. Princess Tsehai married Lt. General [[Abiye Abebe]].

He is viewed as the messiah who will lead the peoples of Africa and the [[African diaspora]] to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/migrations/rasta/rasessay.html |title=The African Diaspora, Ethiopianism, and Rastafari |publisher= Smithsonian education |accessdate= 12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His official titles are ''Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah'' and ''King of Kings of Ethiopia and Elect of God'', and his traditional lineage is thought to be from Solomon and Sheba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debate.uvm.edu/dreadlibrary/cardillo.html |title= Haile Selassie King of Kings, Conquering Lion of the tribe of Judah |publisher=Debate.uvm.edu |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These notions are perceived by Rastafari as confirmation of the return of the messiah in the prophetic [[Book of Revelation]] in the [[New Testament]]: ''King of Kings'', ''Lord of Lords'', ''Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah,'' and ''Root of David''.

In 1961, the Jamaican government sent a delegation composed of both Rastafari and non-Rastafari leaders to Ethiopia to discuss the matter of repatriation, among other issues, with the emperor.  He reportedly told the Rastafari delegation (which included [[Mortimer Planno]]), "Tell the Brethren to be not dismayed, I personally will give my assistance in the matter of repatriation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Barrett | first = Leonard E. |title=The Rastafarians |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=swdaI6DfDkEC&amp;pg=PA118 |year=1988 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0-8070-1039-6 |pages= 118–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haile Selassie visited Jamaica on 21 April 1966, and approximately one hundred thousand Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on [[Palisadoes Airport]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]],&lt;ref name="Dread" /&gt; having heard that the man whom they considered to be their messiah was coming to visit them.

He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally, Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras [[Mortimer Planner|Mortimer Planno]], a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the emperor's descent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], pp. 15, 210, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Planno re-emerged and announced to the crowd: "The Emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm.

From then on, as a result of Planno's actions, the Jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that Rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by the emperor,&lt;ref name=Edmonds86 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Habekost /&gt; and Rastafari elders also ensured that they obtained a private audience with the emperor,&lt;ref name=Edmonds86 /&gt; where he reportedly told them that they should not emigrate to Ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of Jamaica. This dictum came to be known as "[[Liberty|liberation]] before [[repatriation]]".

Haile Selassie defied expectations of the Jamaican authorities&lt;ref name=ReggaeRoutes243 /&gt; and never rebuked the Rastafari for their belief in him as the returned Jesus. Instead, he presented the movement's faithful elders with gold medallions – the only recipients of such an honor on this visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationnews.com/editorial/328181536343408.php |title="African Crossroads – Spiritual Kinsmen" |accessdate=2008-01-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115000944/http://www.nationnews.com/editorial/328181536343408.php |archivedate=15 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }} Dr. Ikael Tafari, ''[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|The Daily Nation]]'', 24 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[People's National Party|PNP]] leader (later Jamaican Prime Minister) [[Michael Manley]]'s visit to Ethiopia in October 1969, the emperor allegedly still recalled his 1966 reception with amazement, and stated that he felt that he had to be respectful of their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Funk, Jerry  (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=k2nAaYYgPoEC&amp;pg=PA149 ''Life Is an Excellent Adventure''].

[[Rita Marley]], [[Bob Marley]]'s wife, converted to the Rastafari faith after seeing Haile Selassie on his Jamaican trip. She claimed in interviews (and in her book ''No Woman, No Cry'') that she saw a ''[[stigmata]]'' print on the palm of Haile Selassie's hand as he waved to the crowd which resembled the markings on Christ's hands from being nailed to the cross—a claim that was not supported by other sources, but was used as evidence for her and other Rastafari to suggest that Haile Selassie I was indeed their messiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marley, Rita |title=No Woman No Cry: My Life with Bob Marley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wT7tgAHcC6MC&amp;pg=PA43|year=2004|page=43|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=978-0-7868-6867-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also influential in the conversion of Bob Marley, who then became internationally recognized. As a result, Rastafari became much better known throughout much of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasta-man-vibration.com/rastafarian.html |title=Bob Marley the Devoted Rastafarian! |publisher=Rasta-man-vibration.com |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Marley's posthumously released song "[[Iron Lion Zion]]" refers to Haile Selassie.

===Selassie's position===
In a 1967 recorded interview Haile Selassie appeared to deny his alleged divinity.  In the interview Bill McNeil says:  "there are millions of Christians throughout the world, your Imperial Majesty, who regard you as the reincarnation of Jesus Christ." Selassie replied in his native language:
{{Quote |I have heard of that idea. I also met certain Rastafarians. I told them clearly that I am a man, that I am mortal, and that I will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity.&lt;ref name="Spencer"&gt;{{cite book |last = Spencer |first =William David|title=Dread Jesus|date=1998|publisher=SPCK Publishing|isbn=978-0-28105101-4|page= 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For many Rastafari the CBC interview is not interpreted as a denial of his divinity, and according to Robert Earl Hood, Haile Selassie neither denied nor affirmed his divinity either way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Hood | first = Robert Earl |title=Must God Remain Greek?: Afro Cultures and God-talk|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-ceFU75KyYQC&amp;pg=PA93+ |date=January 1990|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-2449-1|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican Music'', Kevin Chang and Wayne Chen note:
{{Quote |It's often said, though no definite date is ever cited, that Haile Selassie himself denied his divinity. Former senator and ''Gleaner'' editor, Hector Wynter, tells of asking him, during his visit to Jamaica in 1966, when he was going to tell Rastafari he was not God.

After his return to Ethiopia, he dispatched Archbishop Abuna Yesehaq Mandefro to the [[Caribbean]] to help draw Rastafari and other West Indians to the Ethiopian church and, according to some sources, denied his divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/12/AR2006011201952.html |title= Ethiopians in D.C.

In 1948, Haile Selassie donated a piece of land at [[Shashamane]], 250&amp;nbsp;km south of Addis Ababa, for the use of people of African descent from the West Indies. Numerous Rastafari families settled there and still live as a community to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shashamane.org/history.htm |title= The History and Location of the Shashamane Settlement Community Development Foundation, Inc., USA |publisher= Shashamane |accessdate= 12 September 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110525012620/http://www.shashamane.org/history.htm |archivedate= 25 May 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Morris Naglee''' (January 15, 1815 – March 5, 1886) was a civil engineer, banker, vintner, and a [[Union army|Union]] [[General officer|General]] in the [[American Civil War]].

==Life and career==
Naglee was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], on January 15, 1815. He graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1835 as 23rd in a class of 56 cadets. Posted in the [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|5th U.S. Infantry]] he resigned shortly after his graduation and worked as a civil engineer. Naglee came to California in 1846 during the [[Mexican–American War]] as captain of Company D of the [[1st Regiment of New York Volunteers]]. Leading a detachment of volunteers to [[La Paz]] in [[Baja California]] he fought in the [[Skirmish of Todos Santos]] where he led 45 mounted soldiers into the Mexican rear, which led to the collapse of their resistance. In the following pursuit he ordered the killing of two captured Mexicans without orders, for which the military governor of [[Alta California]], Colonel [[Richard B. Mason]], ordered Naglee arrested. When President Polk granted a pardon to military and naval offenders acting in wartime, Naglee escaped punishment for this crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/84winter/war.htm  Richard W. Amero,  The Journal of San Diego History, The Mexican-American War in Baja California, ''SAN DIEGO HISTORICAL SOCIETY QUARTERLY'', Winter 1984, Volume 30, Number 1, note 37. Ryan, pp. 210-211.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his discharge from the army, in 1849, Captain Naglee became the first commanding officer of the 1st California Guards, a California Militia unit in San Francisco, the beginning of what would become the [[California National Guard]]. He also entered into a career in banking. In 1858 Naglee left San Francisco to study [[viticulture]] in Europe. Later that year, he bought 140 acres (0.570&amp;nbsp;km²) just east of downtown [[San Jose, California]], where he built an estate and planted [[vineyard]]s of [[Riesling]] and [[Douce noir|Charbono]] grapes, from which he distilled [[brandy]]. His high-quality brandy and his great viticultural knowledge made him famous as the "Father of California's brandy industry".

In May 1861 Naglee reentered the [[United States Army]] as [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] of the [[16th Infantry Regiment (United States)|16th U.S. Infantry]]. As the regiment´s recruitment took longer and longer Naglee´s want for active service made him resign in January 1862. Naglee was made a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of Volunteers the next month and given command of a [[brigade]] in the [[IV Corps (Union Army)|IV Corps]] of the [[Army of the Potomac]].  on May 31 and June 1. The division, under command of Gen. [[Silas Casey]], was made up of the greenest troops in the army. During the [[Peninsula Campaign]] he fought in the [[Battle of Fair Oaks]] on May 31. His brigade and the whole division distinguished themselves when they were attacked, but had to fall back in the end. Naglee himself had his horse killed under him and received four wounds from musket-balls. While both praise and blame were given to the division, and Naglee, he wrote a number of reports and letters, increasing his role in the battle, that sparked great criticism and animosity. Later that year he commanded a brigade and a [[division (military)|division]] in [[North Carolina]], participating in the [[Battle of Washington|relief of Washington]]. In 1863 he commanded the [[VII Corps (ACW)|VII Corps]] and the District of Virginia. In 1864 he was mustered out of the army and returned to San Jose to resume banking and brandy making. He also actively campaigned in the election of General McClellan for the Democratic Party.

In 1865 he married 24 years old Marie Antoinette Ringgold, the daughter of his friend George Hays Ringgold and descendant to President [[James Monroe]]. From this marriage were born two daughters, Marie, in 1866, and Antoinette, in 1869. Mrs. Naglee died in 1869 and Naglee never remarried. In California General Naglee was involved in two very public scandals.  In 1865, Mary Schell, whom Naglee had met in 1858 and corresponded with while at war, published his love letters in a book entitled ''The Love Life of Brigadier General Henry M. Naglee, Consisting of a correspondence on Love, War and Politics'', after he broke off their relationship.  In 1877 his nanny Emily Hanks filed a lawsuit against Naglee, claiming he proposed marriage to her and then seduced her.  This led to two trials and three years of headlines in the local newspapers.  The court ruled in Hanks's favor in the first trial, but in Naglee's in the second.

Henry Naglee died on illness in San Francisco on March 5, 1886, and is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. His estate was developed into the residential [[Naglee Park (San Jose)|Naglee Park]] neighborhood in 1902 by his daughters. They erected a stone and brass memorial to Naglee in San Jose's St. James Park, and [[List of streets in San Jose, California|Naglee Avenue]] in San Jose was named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4455">General '''Humberto Ortega Saavedra''' (born January 10, 1947  in [[Managua]]) is a [[Nicaraguan]] military leader, often self-called leading Latin American revolutionary strategist, and published writer.  He was Minister of Defense between the victory of the [[Sandinista revolution]] in 1979 under the National Reconstruction Government, through the first presidency of his brother [[Daniel Ortega Saavedra]], and through the presidency of [[Violeta Barrios de Chamorro]] who defeated Daniel Ortega in the elections of 1990.

==Biography==
Humberto Ortega, his brother, the current [[President of Nicaragua]], [[Daniel Ortega]], and Victor Tirado López founded the Tercerista tendency of the [[Sandinista]] National Liberation Front (FSLN) in 1975. He, among others leaders, crafted the urban insurrection strategy that ignited civil war in [[Nicaragua]] in October 1977 which led to the fall of the Somoza dynastic dictatorship in July 1979.  As Minister of Defense during the decade of Sandinista rule, Ortega oversaw the buildup of the [[Sandinista Popular Army]] (EPS) and the prosecution of the war against the "contra" resistance factions and their peasant support base.

Following the electoral defeat of Daniel Ortega and the Sandinista Party in 1990, Humberto maintained control of the military. Later that year accusations arose against Humberto claiming his involvement in the murder and cover up of sixteen-year-old Jean Paul.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libproxy.ung.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ulh&amp;AN=12030900&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site.|title=Library Proxy Server|last=|first=|date=|website=libproxy.ung.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortega's bodyguards allegedly shot and killed the young man when he attempted to pass the generals motorcade on October 28, 1990.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In November of 1990 the Nicuraugan National Assembly along with experts from the Venisualan Ministry of Justice began an investigation of this incident.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most of the evidence found by the investigators proved to be circumstantial and the travel records for the motorcade were never found.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Civil District Judge Boanerges Ojeda suggested Ortega's bodyguards, two officers, and Humberto be tried in court before he passed the case to the military prosecuters office where it was closed in July of 1992.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He retired  in 1995, turning the job over to his second in command, [[Joaquín Cuadra]]. General Humberto Ortega started transforming the EPS into the non-political Nicaraguan National Army. Allegedly, he was behind the assassination of many retired [[Contras|anti-sandinistas]] rebels.[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/16/opinion/assassins-in-managua.html] This allegation has not been put forward by any legal authority inside or outside of Nicaragua.

==Published writer==
In December 2004 he released a book titled ''La Epopeya de la Insurrección'' (Epic of the Insurrection). Ortega says he worked 10 hours a day on the book for two years using his own records, meeting notes, archives and analytical schemes to reconstruct the history of the struggle that ultimately brought down the 43-year Somoza family dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The General's Book | url =http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/2805 | work =Revista Envío | accessdate = 2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his other books are, ''50 Años de Lucha Sandinista'', ''Sobre la Insurrección'' and ''Nicaragua Revolución y Democracia''.

==Youth and early career==
{{unsourced|section|date=May 2018}}
Drnovšek was born in [[Celje]] and was raised in the small town of [[Kisovec]] in the Municipality of [[Zagorje ob Savi]], where his father Viktor was the local mine chief and his mother Silva was a homemaker. Drnovšek graduated from the [[University of Ljubljana]] with a degree in economics in 1973. 

Meanwhile, he worked as an intern at a [[Le Havre]] bank. In 1975, at the age of 25, he became chief financial officer at SGP Beton Zagorje, a construction company. Two years later he became, for one year, an economic adviser at the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[embassy]] in [[Cairo]].

He defended his master's thesis in 1981, and in 1986, he defended his dissertation in 1986 at the Faculty of Economics and Business at the [[University of Maribor]]. In 1982, he became head of the local branch of Ljubljana Bank in his home region of the [[Central Sava Valley]] in central Slovenia. In 1986 he was chosen to be a delegate at the Slovenian Republic Assembly (parliament) and also the Chamber of Republics and Provinces of the Yugoslav parliament.

==Membership in the Yugoslav presidency==
{{unsourced|section|date=May 2018}}
In 1989, [[Stane Dolanc]], the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]]n representative to the collective presidency of Yugoslavia, retired. The Slovenian [[Communist Party of Slovenia|Communist Party]], aware of upcoming democratisation, decided to organize elections between two candidates for the position. Drnovšek, until then rather unknown to the public, defeated [[:sl:Marko Bulc|Marko Bulc]], the Party's preferred candidate. 

The Communist leaderships of other Yugoslav republics did not agree with this new way of selecting the representative to the Collective Presidency, so the Slovenian Republic Parliament had to confirm the result of the elections. Drnovšek served as chairman of the Collective Presidency from 1989-90. While he was chairman of the presidency, he was also chairman of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the commander of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]]. 

Until the end of communist rule he was an active member of the Communist Party. After the democratic changes in Slovenia, the country seceded from Yugoslavia. Following the [[Ten Day War]], Drnovšek used his position in the Collective Presidency to help mediate the [[Brioni Agreement]] and to negotiate a peaceful withdrawal of [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav army]] from Slovenia.

==Prime Minister of Slovenia==
{{onesource|section|date=May 2018}}
In 1992, after a Government crisis in the [[DEMOS coalition]], which had won the first democratic elections in Slovenia in 1990 and led the country to independence, Drnovšek became the second [[Prime Minister]] of independent Slovenia. He was chosen as a compromise candidate and an expert in economic policy. 

His bi-partisan government was supported both by the left and centrist wing of the dissolved [[DEMOS coalition]] (the [[Social Democratic Party of Slovenia]], the [[Democratic Party (Slovenia)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Greens of Slovenia]]) and by three parties that derived from organizations of the former Communist regime (the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Slovenia)|Liberal Democratic Party]], the [[Social Democrats (Slovenia)|Party of Democratic Reform]] and the [[Socialist Party of Slovenia]]).

Shortly afterwards, Drnovšek was elected president of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Slovenia)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (''Liberalno demokratska stranka'' – LDS), the legal successor of the Association of Socialist Youth of Slovenia (''Zveza socialistične mladine Slovenije'' – ZSMS), the youth fraction of the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]].

In 1992, the Liberal Democratic Party under Drnovšek's leadership won the parliamentary elections, but due to a high fragmentation of the popular vote had to ally itself with other parties in order to form a stable government. Despite a politically turbulent mandate (in 1994, the [[Social Democratic Party of Slovenia]] left the coalition), the Party gained votes in 1996, remaining the largest party in the government. 

Nevertheless, Drnovšek barely secured himself a third term in office after a failed attempt to ally himself with the [[Slovenian National Party]]. In 1997, the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia]] formed a coalition government with the populist [[Slovenian People's Party]] which finally enabled Drnovšek to serve a third term in office.

He headed the government until May 2000, when he stepped down due to disagreements with the [[Slovenian People's Party]]. After less than six months in opposition, Drnovšek returned to power in the autumn of 2000, after his party gained a clear victory in the parliamentary elections.

Drnovšek's governments guided Slovenia's political and [[economic reconstruction]]. He successfully tackled the twin tasks of reorienting Slovenia's trade away from the wreckage of the old Yugoslavia towards the West and replacing the ineffective Communist-era business model with more market-based mechanisms.

Unlike the other five former Yugoslav republics which were run for much of the 1990s by frequently authoritarian presidents, Slovenia under Drnovšek's premiership quickly emerged from the break-up of the federation as a functioning [[parliamentary democracy]]. Drnovšek's political strategy was concentrated on broad coalitions, transcending ideological and programmatic divisions between parties.

[[File:Vladimir Putin 24 March 2001-1.jpg|thumb|Drnovšek with [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2001]]
Contrary to some other former Communist countries in [[Eastern Europe]], the economic and social transformation in Slovenia pursued by Drnovšek's governments followed a [[gradualist]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/janez-drnovsek-slovenian-president-who-achieved-membership-of-the-eu-and-nato-for-the-former-yugoslav-republic-786789.html "Janez Drnovsek: Slovenian president who achieved membership of the EU and Nato for the former Yugoslav republic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705211518/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/janez-drnovsek-slovenian-president-who-achieved-membership-of-the-eu-and-nato-for-the-former-yugoslav-republic-786789.html|date=5 July 2015|publisher=independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drnovšek was a staunch supporter of Slovenia's entry in the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]] and was largely responsible for Slovenia's successful bid for membership in both of those organizations. As Prime minister, he was frequently active on foreign policy issues. On 16 June 2001, he helped to arrange the first meeting of the U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] with the Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], which was held in the [[Upper Carniola]]n estate of [[Brdo pri Kranju]]. ([[Bush-Putin 2001]]) In 2002, he ran for [[President of Slovenia]], and was elected in the second round, defeating the center-right candidate [[Barbara Brezigar]].

==President of Slovenia and the change in lifestyle==
Drnovšek's presidency was highly controversial. In the first three years in office, he rarely appeared in public, save for the most important official duties. In 2006, however, a change of style became visible. He launched several campaigns in foreign policy, such as a failed humanitarian mission to [[Darfur]] and a proposal for the solution of the political crisis in [[Kosovo]]. On January 30, 2006, he left the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia]]. Shortly afterwards, he founded the [[Movement for Justice and Development (Slovenia)|Movement for Justice and Development]] and became its first president. He claimed this was not meant to be a political movement, but rather a wide initiative, aiming to "raise human consciousness and make the world a better place". On June 26, 2006, he announced that he would not be running for a second term in an interview on [[RTV Slovenia|TV Slovenia]].

=== Conflict with the Government ===
[[File:Jacques Delors i Janez Drnovsek.jpg|thumb|Drnovšek with [[Jacques Delors]] in 1989]]
The [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2004|2004 legislative election]] brought further changes and a political swing to the right. [[Janez Janša]], the leader of a right-wing coalition, formed the new government. In Slovenia, this was the first time after 1992 that the President and the Prime Minister had represented opposing political factions for more than a few months. Between 2002-04, the relationship between President Drnovšek and Janez Janša, then leader of the opposition, were considered more than good&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200328/clanek/konvencija/index.print.html-l2|title=Tednik, številka 28, Iskalci vizije|publisher=Mladina.Si|date=14 July 2003|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the first year of cohabitation, no major problems arose.

In the beginning of his term, Drnovšek, who was ill with [[kidney cancer]], stayed out of public view. When he reemerged in late 2005 he had already changed his lifestyle: he had become a [[vegan]] (though one of his colleagues in a televised interview mentioned their regular sunday visits to a pizzeria in Maxi market, Ljubljana), moved out of the capital into the countryside, and withdrew from party politics completely, ending his already frozen membership in the Liberal Democracy. Drnovšek's new approach to politics prompted one political commentator to nickname him "Slovenia's [[Gandhi]]".&lt;ref name="NYT about Drnovšek"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/09/world/europe/09drnovsek.html|title=Slovenian President Finds Peace and Wants to Share It|accessdate=5 September 2008|work=The New York Times|first=Nicholas|last=Wood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article2870371.ece|title=All hail the mystic President|accessdate=5 September 2008|publisher=Times Online|date=15 November 2007|location=London, UK|first=Martin|last=Fletcher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Drnovšek and the government quickly became tense. Disagreements began with Drnovšek's initiatives in foreign politics, aimed at solving major foreign conflicts, including those in [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]] and [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; Initially, these initiatives were initially not openly opposed by the Prime Minister, but were criticized by the foreign minister [[Dimitrij Rupel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200544/clanek/slo--zunanja_politika-ali_h_zerdin|title=Tednik, številka 44, Kosovska bitka: Drnovšek proti Ruplu|publisher=Mladina.Si|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drnovšek's former collaborator and close political ally until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://24ur.com/novice/slovenija/rop-rupel-se-je-odlocil-po-svoje.html?ar=|title=Rop: Rupel se je odločil po svoje|publisher=24ur.com|date=26 June 2004|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A major clash between the two happened in Summer 2006, when disagreement arose over Drnovšek's attempt to intervene in the Darfur conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delo.si/clanek/o154553|title=Rupel kritičen do Drnovškovega urada|publisher=Delo.si|date=18 August 2006|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disagreements moved from issues of domestic politics in October 2006, when Drnovšek publicly criticised the treatment of the Strojans, a [[Romani people|Romani]] family whose neighborhood had forced them to relocate, which in turn had subjected them to police supervision and limitation of movement.&lt;ref name="NYT about Drnovšek"/&gt; 

The disagreements however escalated when the parliamentary majority repeatedly rejected President's candidates for the Governor of the [[Bank of Slovenia]], beginning with the rejection of incumbent [[Mitja Gaspari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukom.gov.si/eng/slovenia/publications/slovenia-news/4274/4288|title=Gaspari Three Votes Short of Winning Second Term|accessdate=5 September 2008|publisher=Government communication office|date=6 February 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305035710/http://www.ukom.gov.si/eng/slovenia/publications/slovenia-news/4274/4288|archivedate=5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The friction continued over the appointment of other state official nominees, including [[Constitutional Court of Slovenia|Constitutional Court]] judges. Although the President's political support suffered after his personal transformation, the polls nevertheless showed public backing of the President against an increasingly unpopular Government.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200722/clanek/slo-tema--jure_trampus|title=Lepotica in zver|accessdate=5 September 2008|publisher=Mladina|language=Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The tension reached its apex in May 2007, when the newly appointed director of the [[Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency]] [[Matjaž Šinkovec]] unclassified several documents from the period before 2004, revealing, among other, that Drnovšek had used secret service funds for personal purposes between 2002-04. The President reacted with a harsh criticism of the government's policies, accusing the ruling coalition of abusing its power for personal delegitimations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://24ur.com/novice/slovenija/vlada-me-skusa-zlomiti.html|title='Vlada me skuša zlomiti'|publisher=24ur.com|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and labeled the Prime Minister as "the leader of the negative guys"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tekst: Rok Praprotnik|url=http://www.dnevnik.si/novice/slovenija/306840|title=Obletnica Dnevnikovega razkritja: Po letu dni afera Sova še vedno brez epiloga|publisher=Dnevnik.si|date=21 March 2008|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last months in office, Drnovšek continued his attacks on Prime Minister Janez Janša, who mostly remained silent on the issue. Drnovšek accused Janša of "fostering proto-totalitarian tendencies". He became a [[blog]]ger ([https://web.archive.org/web/20120502013837/http://janezd.blog.siol.net/ Janez D]), signing his posts as "Janez D" and expressing opinions on various issues from foreign policy, environmentalism, human relationships, religion, animal rights and personal growth. In his last months in office, he withdrew to a reclusive life again, devoting his time to the [[Movement for Justice and Development (Slovenia)|Movement for Justice and Development]] and the popularization of his lifestyle and views.

===Lifestyle changes===
During his time in office as the President of Slovenia, he wrote and published several books in [[spiritual philosophy]], including ''Misli o življenju in zavedanju'' ("Thoughts on Life and Consciousness"), ''Zlate misli o življenju in zavedanju'' ("Golden Thoughts on Life and Consciousness"), ''Bistvo sveta'' ("The Essence of the World"), and his last one called ''Pogovori'' or Dialogues. According to his own accounts, it took him only two or three weeks to write each of his books, due to – in his words – "the higher consciousness" he was able to access.

His lifestyle was a mixture of elements from various traditions, including [[Hindu]] religious thought and the non-attachment of [[Buddhist]] philosophy. He also valued the indigenous traditions of the world. For example, he was present at the inauguration of [[Evo Morales]], the first native American president of [[Bolivia]], and later hosted Bolivian ethnic musicians in the [[Presidential Palace, Ljubljana|Presidential Palace]] in Ljubljana. After his diagnosis, Drnovšek became a [[veganism|vegan]], and claims that this greatly improved his health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/janez-drnovsek-slovenian-president-who-achieved-membership-of-the-eu-and-nato-for-the-former-yugoslav-republic-786789.html Janez Drnovsek: Slovenian president who achieved membership of the EU and Nato for the former Yugoslav republic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705211518/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/janez-drnovsek-slovenian-president-who-achieved-membership-of-the-eu-and-nato-for-the-former-yugoslav-republic-786789.html|date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his new lifestyle and the content of his books and blogs, he was often regarded as an adherent of the [[New Age]] movement, although he rejected such a qualification as being too narrow.

==Personal life==
Drnovšek was fluent in six languages, [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gov.si/up-rs/2002-2007/jd-ang.nsf/dokumentiweb/Zivljenjepis?OpenDocument Biography of Janez Drnovšek] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172933/http://www2.gov.si/up-rs/2002-2007/jd-ang.nsf/dokumentiweb/Zivljenjepis?OpenDocument|date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was divorced with one son, [[Jaša Drnovšek|Jaša]], who is a translator and journalist. 

In 2005, he found out about the existence of a daughter, [[Nana Forte]], otherwise a renowned composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/drnovsek-o-nacrtih-in-svoji-hcerki/48268|title=Drnovšek o načrtih in svoji hčerki|language=Slovenian|trans-title=Drnovšek about his Plans and his Daughter|newspaper=MMC RTV Slovenia|date=1 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister is [[Helena Drnovšek Zorko]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slovenskenovice.si/novice/slovenija/vlada-na-groznje-o-napadu-se-ne-odgovarja|title=Vlada na grožnje o napadu (še) ne odgovarja|language=Slovenian|trans-title=The Government Does not (yet) Respond to the Attack Threats|newspaper=Slovenske novice|date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has been the Slovenian ambassador in Japan since September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tokio.veleposlanistvo.si/index.php?id=3295&amp;L=1|title=Ambassador|publisher=Embassy of the Republic of Slovenia Tokyo|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Death===
In 1999, Drnovšek had [[kidney cancer]] resulting in the removal of a kidney. In 2001, he had cancerous formations on his lungs and liver. He repeatedly claimed [[nature]] was the best cure, and spent most of his days at his home in Zaplana. He died there on February 23, 2008, aged 57. His body was cremated shortly afterwards. He was buried with honors in a private memorial service in his native Zagorje ob Savi, alongside his parents.&lt;ref name="nyti_Jane"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Janez Drnovsek, Slovenian Leader, Is Dead at 57|last=Press|first=The Associated|work=The New York Times|date=26 February 2008|accessdate=5 September 2016|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/26/world/europe/26drnovsek.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jeje Odongo was born in [[Amuria District]], in the [[Teso sub-region]], in [[Eastern Region, Uganda|Eastern Uganda]]. He attended secondary school at [[Ngora High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/Ngora-High-marks-100-years-as-Teso-education-anchor/688342-2349696-4wa59fz/index.html|title=Ngora High marks 100 years as Teso education anchor|
publisher=Daily Monitor|date=16 June 2014|first=.|last=Richard Otim|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the Ugandan army in 1979. He is one of the original twenty seven combatants who, together with [[Yoweri Museveni]], attacked Kabamba Military Barracks in February 1981 to start the [[Ugandan Bush War]], a guerrilla war that lasted from February 1981 until April 1986. Jeje Odongo was captured soon after the first NRA operation and was imprisoned in Luzira Maximum Security Prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.highbeam.com/3548/article-1G1-87056546/jeje-odongo-reveals-nra-roots|title=Jeje Odongo Reveals NRA Roots|
publisher=Highbeam Business|date=10 June 2002|first=.|last=Africa News Service|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Jeje Odongo was one of the ten army officers who represented the Ugandan military in the [[Constituent Assembly]] that drafted the 1995 Ugandan [[Constitution]]. In 1996, he was selected to replace Colonel Sserwanga Lwanga as the Political Commissar in the [[Uganda People's Defense Force]] (UPDF). Also in 1996, he contested the parliamentary seat for Amuria District in the [[Parliament of Uganda|Ugandan Parliament]]. He won and was appointed as Minister of Defence soon after he entered parliament.

In 1998, he resigned his parliamentary seat and his cabinet position and was appointed Commander of the Army, taking over from Major General [[Mugisha Muntu]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2084">'''Jofroi of Waterford''' ([[fl.]] 1300) was a French translator.

Probably a native of [[Waterford]] in Ireland, Jofroi was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], apparently based in [[Paris]], where he produced translations of Latin works into the French language. "He has no surviving connection with Ireland other than his name. It appears from an allusion in his work that he was based in Paris."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Evelyn Mullally at [https://books.google.com/books?id=kVslRbrSH7QC&amp;pg=PA186].&lt;/ref&gt;

Jofroi's known translations are:

* translation of the ''[[Secretum Secretorum]]'', one of the most widely read books in Western Europe in the Late Middle Ages. Jofroi's French was later translated into English.
* translation of a history of the Trojan War, authorship attributed to [[Dares Phrygius]] ([[pseudepigraphical]]). (Another book  widely circulated in Latin in the Late Middle Ages.)
* translation of a history of Rome by [[Eutropius (historian)]]. (Once again, a popular book in Latin).
* a co-translation, with Servais Copale, of three prose poems

His original work is a catalogue of all the known [[History of wine|wines]] and [[History of beer|ales]] of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Kibwetere''' was one of the leaders of the [[Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dialogueireland.wordpress.com/2012/03/20/the-movement-for-the-restoration-of-the-ten-commandments-of-god/|title=The Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God|date=2012-03-20|website=Dialogue Ireland|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group that splintered from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Uganda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/uganda_002.htm|title=Tragedy in Uganda: the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, a Post-Catholic Movement|last=MoreOrLess|website=www.cesnur.org|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became infamous after [[Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God#Apocalypse|778 of its members were found dead]]. Although it was initially assumed that Joseph died in the incident the Ugandan police shortly afterwards issued a warrant for arrest against Joseph Kibweteere and the other leaders of the group.&lt;ref name="POISON"&gt;Cult in Uganda Poisoned Many, Police Say ''New York Times'' July 28, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 it was announced by the [[Uganda National Police]] that there were reports that Kibweteere was hiding in [[Malawi]].&lt;ref name="MALAWAI"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOgZAcFRuyE NTVUganda; "Kanungu Massacre: Report claims Kibwetere is hiding in Malawi"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Many details of Kibweteere's life, and especially death, remain unclear. What is known is that he came from a strongly pious Catholic background and was likely wealthy by Ugandan standards. The second idea comes from the fact he ran for political office in 1980 and had enough land to donate for a school of his own design. The Catholic school he founded and led was apparently orthodox and at that point he had a positive image in the community. In 1960 he married a woman who would prove to outlive him.

The Uganda he lived in suffered from both religious and political upheaval which likely influenced him. The strongest of which may have been religious movements that emphasized miracles and [[Marian apparitions]]. In 1984 he claimed to be experiencing sightings of the Virgin Mary. This vision had been brought to him by [[Credonia Mwerinde]].
Mt Randz

==Religious acts==
Around 1989 he came into contact with a woman named [[Credonia Mwerinde]], a prostitute who claimed she was looking to repent for her sins. She had a background of claimed experiences dating back further than Kibweteere. Credonia claimed that she could see the virgin Mary when looking at a stone on the mountains. The stone looked the spitting image of the Virgin Mary. Her father claimed to have had a vision of his dead daughter Evangelista as early as 1960. His children and grandchildren would be affected by this. By 1989, Credonia and her Ursula were travelling through Uganda spreading the family's message. When Credonia met Joseph he welcomed her with open arms and shared his own experiences. This would lead to their forming the [[Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God]].

After the death of Credonia's father, he became leader of the group. In the 1990s they strongly emphasized [[apocalypticism]] in their booklet ''A Timely Message from Heaven: The End of the Present Time''. Hence he led an elite group of six men and six women deemed to be the "new apostles." These apostles had an equal number of women because of the emphasis they placed on [[Mother Mary]] as instrumental in sweeping them toward heaven. The group stated several dates where it would be the end of the world, however, several of these dates passed by with no sign of an apocalypse. Reportedly he stated that the year 2000 would be followed by "year 1 of the new world." These and other claims had little effect on the wider world. For the most part he remained an obscure figure in Uganda and never formally split with the Catholic Church.

==Time of disappearance==
In March 2000 the group began slaughtering cattle and buying massive amounts of [[Coca-Cola]]. These events did not initially raise alarm, but they were preparation for a feast before death. On March 17, Kibweteere apparently died in the group's [[mass suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dialogueireland.wordpress.com/2012/03/20/the-movement-for-the-restoration-of-the-ten-commandments-of-god/|title=The Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God|date=2012-03-20|website=Dialogue Ireland|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A member of Kibweteere's family stated that Joseph's actions were completely influenced by Credonia Mwerinde.

A great deal remains unclear about his story and the movement. The BBC reported that Kibweteere had been treated for [[bipolar disorder]] a year or so before the group suicide. At the time the Ugandan authorities considered him a fugitive and mass-murderer because they believed him to have escaped. The date and nature of the apocalypse they expected is debated. There is one camp that indicates they believed it would come in 1999 and that the 2000 suicide was caused by the failure of that prophecy. This would seem confirmed by some of their activities of 1999, but in their literature 2000 is often seen as the end year. The nature of his role and significance to the events is also disputed. Due to the circumstances of events, satisfactory answers to these and other questions may never be forthcoming. Kibwetere did all this in the Kanungu district in western Uganda.

'''Juliet Mitchell''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 1940) is a British [[professor]], [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], [[Socialist feminism|socialist feminist]] and author.

== Early life and education ==
Mitchell was born in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, in 1940, and then moved to England in 1944, where she stayed with her grandparents in the midlands. 
She attended [[St Anne's College, Oxford]], where she received a degree in English in 1962, as well as doing [[postgraduate]] work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/DO/filmshow/mitchell1tx_off.htm |title=Juliet Mitchell interviewed by Alan Macfarlane 6th May 2008 |publisher=Alanmacfarlane.com |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
She taught [[English literature]] from 1962 to 1970 at [[Leeds University]] and [[Reading University]]. Throughout the 1960s, Mitchell was active in [[leftist]] [[politics]], and was on the editorial committee of the journal, ''[[New Left Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Juliet Mitchell 1940–|last1=Benewick |first1= Robert | last2 = Green | first2 = Philip |title=The Routledge dictionary of twentieth-century political thinkers |publisher= Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415096232|page=228 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-jnaCUyzjMQC&amp;pg=PA228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== ''Women: The Longest Revolution''=== 
Mitchell gained instant media attention with her pathbreaking article “[http://platypus1917.org/wp-content/uploads/archive/rgroups/2008-chicago/mitchelljuliet_womenlongestrevolution_nlr40.pdf Women: The Longest Revolution]", in the ''[[New Left Review]]'' (1966), an original synthesis of [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Frederich Engels]], [[Viola Klein]], [[Betty Friedan]] and other analysts of women's oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Juliet Mitchell |url=https://newleftreview.org/I/40/juliet-mitchell-women-the-longest-revolution |title=Juliet Mitchell: Women: The Longest Revolution.

=== The Cambridge University Centre for Gender Studies ===
She is a fellow professor of Psychoanalysis at the [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] and founded the Centre for Gender Studies at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/people/professor-juliet-c-w-mitchell |title=Professor Juliet Mitchell &amp;#124; Jesus College in the University of Cambridge |publisher=Jesus.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2010 she is appointed director of the Expanded Doctoral School in Psychoanalytic Studies at the Psychoanalysis Unit of [[University College London]] (UCL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychoanalysis/unit-staff/juliet.htm UCL: Juliet Mitchell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102125301/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychoanalysis/unit-staff/juliet.htm |date=2012-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is a retired registrant of the [[British Psychoanalytic Council]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

=== Psychoanalysis and Feminism ===

Mitchell is best known for her book ''Psychoanalysis and Feminism: [[Freud]], [[Wilhelm Reich|Reich]], [[R. D. Laing|Laing]] and Women'' (1974),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mitchell | first = Juliet | title = Psychoanalysis and feminism: Freud, Reich, Laing, and women | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York | year = 1974 | isbn = 9780394474724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she tried to reconcile [[psychoanalysis]] and [[feminism]] at a time when many considered them incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/m/i.htm#mitchell-juliet Juliet Mitchell Archive at marxists.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Gay]] considered it "the most rewarding and responsible contribution"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gay | first = Peter | author-link = Peter Gay | title = Freud: a life for our time | publisher = Dent | location = London | page = 774 | year = 1988 | isbn = 9780460047616 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the feminist debate on [[Freud]], both acknowledging and rising beyond Freud's [[male chauvinism]] in its analysis. Mitchell saw Freud's asymmetrical view of masculinity and femininity as reflecting the realities of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal culture]], and sought to use his critique of femininity to critique patriarchy itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Herik | first = Judith | title = Freud on femininity and faith | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1985 | page = 15 | isbn = 9780520053335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By insisting on the utility of Freud (particularly in a [[Lacan|Lacanian]] reading) for feminism, she opened the way for further critical work on psychoanalysis and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tandon | first = Neeru | title = Feminism: a paradigm shift | publisher = Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors | location = New Delhi | year = 2008 | page = 83 | isbn = 9788126908882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;She was an Andrew Dickson White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University from 1993 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adwhiteprofessors.cornell.edu/all-professors-at-large-1965-to-june-30-20222/|title=All Professors at Large, 1965-2023|last=Dietrich|first=Penny|date=2018|website=Program for Andrew D. White Professors at Large|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child-rearing ===
A substantial part of the thesis of the book is that [[Marxism]] may provide a model within which non-[[patriarchy|patriarchal]] structures for rearing children could occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Mitchell | first = Juliet | contribution = The Oedipus Complex and the patriarchal society | editor-last =  Mitchell | editor-first = Juliet | title = Psychoanalysis and feminism: a radical reassessment of Freudian psychoanalysis | pages = 377–381 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York City | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780465046089 | quote = Under capitalism, the mass of mankind, propertyless and working socially together ''en masse'' for the first time in the history of civilization would be unlikely, ''were it not for the preservation of the family''...  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of the 'family romance' would remove the [[Oedipus complex]] from a child's development, thus liberating women from the consequences of [[penis envy]] and the feeling of being [[Castration|castrated]] which Mitchell contends is the root cause of women's acceptance that they are inferior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Mitchell | first = Juliet | contribution = The castration complex and penis-envy | editor-last =  Mitchell | editor-first = Juliet | title = Psychoanalysis and feminism: a radical reassessment of Freudian psychoanalysis | pages = 95–100 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York City | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780465046089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mitchell, children are socialised into appropriate gender roles. Therefore, women grow to be equally socialised into becoming the caretakers of their households.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Mitchell | first = Juliet | contribution = Conclusion: The holy family and femininity  | editor-last =  Mitchell | editor-first = Juliet | title = Psychoanalysis and feminism: a radical reassessment of Freudian psychoanalysis | pages = 364–416 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York City| year = 2000 | isbn = 9780465046089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminine sexuality ===
In her introduction to [[Jacques Lacan]] on feminine sexuality, Mitchell stresses that "in the Freud that Lacan uses, neither the unconscious nor sexuality...[are] pre-given facts, they are [[Social constructivism|constructions]]; that is, they are objects with histories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = Juliet (editor) | last2 = Lacan | first2 = Jacques (author) | last3 = Rose | first3 = Jacqueline (translator and editor) | author-link2 = Jacques Lacan | author-link3 = Jacqueline Rose | title = Feminine sexuality: Jacques Lacan and the école freudienne | publisher = Pantheon Books W.W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15970">[[File:Lean Bear .jpg|thumb|Cheyenne Peace Chief believed to be Lean Bear. Taken 1863, in Washington D.C.]]
'''Lean Bear''' ([[Cheyenne language|Cheyenne]] name '''Awoninahku''', 1813–1864), alternatively translated as '''Starving Bear''',&lt;ref name=WestE&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contested Plains: Indians, Goldseekers, and the Rush to Colorado|first=Elliott|last=West|year=1998|publisher=University Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, KN|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Cheyenne]] peace chief.&lt;ref name=r182&gt;Ricky 182&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Council of Forty-four]],&lt;ref name="The Earth is Weeping"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cozzens|first1=Peter|title=The Earth is Weeping|publisher=Knopf}}&lt;/ref&gt; a tribal governance devoted to maintaining peace with encroaching [[United States]] settlers. Lean Bear's most notable peace deals include the [[Treaty of Fort Wise]] &lt;ref name="weeks"/&gt; and a meeting with US President [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="Harjo 145"/&gt; His work towards peace between his people and the American settlers in the Southern Plains was cut short when he was killed by the [[1st Colorado Cavalry Regiment]] and violent retaliations ensued.&lt;ref name="weeks"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Lean Bear suffered from vertigo, which commonly ran in the family. During a meeting with President [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1863, he suffered an attack and spoke while seated in a chair.&lt;ref name="Harjo 145"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harjo|first1=Suzan|title=Nation to Nation|date=2014|publisher=Smithsonian Books|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lean Bear brushed it off as a result of him simply being too nervous to stand.&lt;ref name="Hoig145"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoig|first1=Stan|title=Peace Chiefs of the Cheyennes|date=1980|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations===
Lean Bear had a brother called Bull Bear. In 1864, Bull Bear was the leader of the [[Dog Soldiers]], a position he would hold for many years.&lt;ref name="Hoig84"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoig|first1=Stan|title=Peace Chiefs of the Cheyennes|date=1980|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=84–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lean Bear also worked closely and served on the [[Council of Forty-four]] with fellow peace chief [[Black Kettle]], especially in the last decade of his life.&lt;ref name="Hoig68"/&gt;

== Political life ==
The first known account in history of Lean Bear is in 1851. He was roughly 35 at this time.&lt;ref name="miller part 1"&gt;{{citation|title=Killing Lean Bear, Part 1|last1=Miller|first1=Courtney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agent [[Thomas Fitzpatrick (trapper)|Thomas Fitzpatrick]] was hosting a council in [[Fort Atkinson (Nebraska)|Fort Atkinson]] to convince plains tribes to attend a larger peace council at Fort Laramie later on.&lt;ref name="Hoig68"/&gt; The Comanche, Kiowa, Apache, Arapaho, and Cheyenne people went out to meet the soldiers and each other. They feasted and traded goods.&lt;ref name="Hoig68"/&gt; Fitzpatrick spoke with each group, and eventually convinced the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes to attend the next peace council. The other tribes refused, wary about bringing their horses up north near tribes that were notorious for stealing horses.&lt;ref name="Hoig68"/&gt;

The troops were beginning to leave as the council ended when [[Edwin Vose Sumner|Colonel Sumner]] arrived at Fort Atkinson on his way to [[New Mexico]]. He stayed for a few days to trade and obtain some horses from the tribes in attendance.&lt;ref name="Hoig68"/&gt; After some time, the tribes began to freely explore both the fort and his camp, and Fitzpatrick grew nervous at the opportunities for conflict.&lt;ref name="Hoig68"/&gt; Lean Bear, who was in attendance at the peace council, was fascinated by the rings and bracelets on the hand of Sumner's wife and grabbed to get a better look. She reacted by pulling her hand back and screaming, provoking Sumner to rush forward to beat Lean Bear.&lt;ref name="miller part 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoig68"&gt;{{cite book|title=Peace Chiefs of the Cheyennes|date=July 31, 1990|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=68–69|last1=Hoig|first1=Stan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Cheyenne culture considers striking even a male child to be an insult, Lean Bear was incredibly indignant about the assault.&lt;ref name="Hoig68"/&gt; He painted his face and rode around his camp announcing his plans to attack the whites, inviting his brothers to join him.&lt;ref name="Hoig68" /&gt; Fitzpatrick initially refused to make reparations until some Kiowas and Comanches told him that the Cheyennes were getting ready to attack. A meeting was later arranged for Colonel Sumner to present Lean Bear with a blanket in apology, which he accepted.&lt;ref name="miller part 1" /&gt;

===Council of Forty-Four===
Lean Bear was chosen to join the Council of Forty-four{{When|date=April 2017}} by past chiefs, as the council chose its own successors.&lt;ref name="Hoig11"&gt;{{cite book|title=Peace Chiefs of the Cheyennes|date=July 31, 1990|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=11–13|last1=Hoig|first1=Stan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council worked to sway their people towards a preference for peace with the Americans. Once named a chief of the council, one would have to give up membership in the war societies that new chiefs often came from.&lt;ref name="Hoig11"/&gt; These efforts contrasted with the increasingly vocal [[Dog Soldiers]], bands of Cheyennes who held a longstanding opposition to white settlement and did not wait to cooperate and make peace.&lt;ref name="half breed 161"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halaas|first1=David|last2=Masich|first2=Andrew|title=Halfbreed|date=March 16, 2005|publisher=Da Capo Press|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stole livestock and fought with troops and settlers.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Ballard|title=Disasters, Accidents, and Crises in American History:|date=2008|publisher=InfoBase Publishing|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dog Soldiers were exiled for their behavior and deemed renegades, operating independently of the tribe. Nonetheless, their provocative nature caused a lot of trouble for the peace-seeking Cheyennes.&lt;ref name="half breed 117"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halaas|first1=David|last2=Masich|first2=Andrew|title=Halfbreed|date=March 16, 2005|publisher=Da Capo Press|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treaty of Fort Wise===
On October 1857, Chief Lean Bear and three other Cheyenne chiefs approached [[William Bent]] with concern about attacks on his people by Sumner's troops along the [[Republican River]].&lt;ref name="miller part 1"/&gt; Bent then sent a letter to Washington D.C. on their behalf, stating that the Cheyenne chiefs would like to speak with someone from the government. The response came in 1860, when Commissioner A.B. Greenwood met the chiefs at Fort Wise.&lt;ref name="Hoig68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoig62"/&gt; Chief Lean Bear was one of the principal signers in the [[Treaty of Fort Wise]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fixico|first1=Donald|title=Treaties with American Indians|date=December 12, 2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=351–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; This treaty was made with Cheyenne and [[Arapaho]] chiefs, cutting roughly 40 million acres of land from their territory.&lt;ref name="NPS 2"/&gt;

There were mixed responses to the deal, including scorn from the Dog Soldiers, because only six Cheyenne chiefs were present to sign the treaty, when all forty-four are typically needed when treaties and alliances are being made.&lt;ref name="Hoig145"/&gt; The deal was made in an attempt to keep peace as pioneers spread near Indian territory, but the land reduction and the continued encroachment by white settlers only heightened tensions.&lt;ref name="NPS 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sainio|first1=Eric|title=A Tale of Two Treaties|url=https://www.nps.gov/sand/learn/news/a-tale-of-two-treaties.htm|website=National Park Service|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cheyennes were not ready to forced into the confines of the small reserve, where there were not many buffalo, allocated for them in the treaty.&lt;ref name="Hoig62"&gt;{{cite book|title=Peace Chiefs of the Cheyennes|date=July 31, 1990|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|page=62|last1=Hoig|first1=Stan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meeting in Washington D.C. ===

Lean Bear is believed to be one of the people in the lower left of the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Peace Chiefs of the Cheyennes|last=Hoig|first=Stan|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On March 27, 1863, a delegation of chiefs and two women met with President [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the East room of the White House.&lt;ref name="Hoig70"&gt;{{cite book|title=Peace Chiefs of the Cheyennes|date=July 31, 1990|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=70–73|last1=Hoig|first1=Stan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was called after skirmishes with Native tribes and white settlers created fear that southern plains tribes would side with the confederacy.&lt;ref name="Hoig68"/&gt; Lincoln was hoping to persuade Native Nations to either ally with the Union, or pledge neutrality.&lt;ref name="Harjo 145" /&gt;

Lincoln welcomed the chiefs, explaining that white Americans had conquered an expansive population, territory, and wealth that white Americans had gained.&lt;ref name="Malcolmson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malcolmson|first1=Scott|title=One Drop of Blood: The American Misadventure of Race|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lean Bear implored the president to stop his white Americans from being violent so that Indians and whites alike could travel across the plains without risk. Lincoln told the chiefs that their Native people were naturally more tempted to violence.&lt;ref name="Malcolmson" /&gt; He further explained that in order to survive and be prosperous, the Native Americans would have to adopt methods of cultivating the land that were more similar to the way of the whites.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harjo 146"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harjo|first1=Suzan|title=Nation to Nation|date=2014|publisher=Smithsonian Books|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln also requested that the southern Plains Indians remain neutral in the [[American Civil War]], ready to provide peace medals to those that he could reach an agreement with.&lt;ref name="Harjo 145" /&gt; The chiefs complied, promising to uphold peace treaties and not align with the confederacy.&lt;ref name="Harjo 147"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harjo|first1=Suzan|title=Nation to Nation|date=2014|publisher=Smithsonian Books|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lean Bear then made a request to the president to expedite his and the other chiefs' journey home.&lt;ref name="The Earth is Weeping" /&gt;

==Killing of Lean Bear==
On May 16, 1864, less than 15 months after meeting Lincoln in Washington,&lt;ref name = "NPS" /&gt; Lean Bear, Black Kettle, and others in the tribe were camping on their buffalo hunting grounds near [[Ash Creek Township, Ellsworth County, Kansas|Ash Creek]]. The [[1st Colorado Cavalry Regiment|1st Colorado Regiment]], under the command of Lieutenant [[George Eayre]], approached the group. Although there had been a fight around a month previous involving Cheyenne Dog Soldiers at Fremont's Orchard, Lean Bear was confident that the violence wouldn't be associated with his peaceful tribe and was not concerned as the soldiers got closer.&lt;ref name="half breed 127"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halaas|first1=David|last2=Masich|first2=Andrew|title=Halfbreed|date=March 16, 2005|publisher=Da Capo Press|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="weeks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weeks|first1=Philip|title=Farewell, My Nation: The American Indian and the United States in the Nineteenth Century|date=February 16, 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive that this would be a peaceful encounter, Lean Bear went alone to meet the militia to show his peaceful intentions.&lt;ref name="half breed 117"/&gt; On his chest, Lean Bear proudly wore his peace medal that he had received on his trip to Washington D.C. in 1863. In his hand, he held an official document signed by President Lincoln stating that he was peaceful and friendly with whites.&lt;ref name="half breed 117"/&gt; What Lean Bear did not realize was that Eayre's troops were operating under orders from Colonel [[John M. Chivington]] to "kill Cheyennes whenever and wherever found."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Utley|first1=Robert|title=Indian Frontier of the American West 1846-1890|publisher=Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eayre ordered his men to shoot Lean Bear, who was wounded and fell off his horse. He was then shot repeatedly by the soldiers as they rode past his body on the ground.&lt;ref name="half breed 117"/&gt;

The troops rode on to attack other Cheyennes at the camp, killing at least one more warrior and wounding many others at the camp.&lt;ref name="half breed 117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller Part 2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://courtneymillerauthor.com/2014/05/killing-lean-bear-part-2/|title=Killing Lean Bear Part 2|last=Miller|first=Courtney|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weeks"/&gt; Cheyenne warriors armed themselves and mounted their horses, ready to retaliate.&lt;ref name = "weeks"/&gt; Black Kettle rode out to de-escalate the situation, stopping any further violence, and the American troops retreated to [[Fort Larned]].

===Aftermath of the killing===
Rising tensions caused by the death of Lean Bear, along with Eayre's other Indian camp raids, is heavily attributed to the [[Sand Creek Massacre]] that occurred six months later.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt; Lean Bear's brother, Bull Bear, was livid after the killing and felt compelled to violence against the white men, a desire he had never felt before.&lt;ref name="Bull Bear"/&gt; Bull Bear remarked that his brother had died while trying to keep peace with the settlers, and he expected to die in the same way.&lt;ref name="Hoig11"/&gt; He called for war but was shot down at a meeting with Wynkoop, the Fort Lyon Commander, on September 10, 1864.&lt;ref name ="Bull Bear"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thrapp|first1=Dan|title=Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography: A-F|date=June 1, 1991|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Black Kettle's best efforts to keep the peace, attacks by Native warriors in the Southern Plains skyrocketed as the vengeful tribes burned ranches and trails, kidnapping settlers and their livestock.&lt;ref name="weeks"/&gt; Over time, the Dog Soldiers' popularity rose, and they overrode Black Kettle's efforts to resist war.&lt;ref name="Hoig11"/&gt; The Governor of Colorado issued a proclamation giving each citizen permission and encouragement to retaliate by killing any Indians and seek compensation for stolen property.&lt;ref name="weeks"/&gt;

==Legacy==
There are no confirmed images of Lean Bear. There are only images and paintings of the full room in 1863 when the delegation went to meet president Lincoln. There are many differing accounts on the identities of each chief in the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheyenne Biography: Chief Lean Bear.|url=https://laef.newsvine.com/_news/2007/01/25/532762-cheyenne-biography-chief-lean-bear|website=Newsvine|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common usage by sources about Lean Bear is an image of a Cheyenne peace chief who is typically believed to be Lean Bear.&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Craig|title=Chief Lean Bear Murder|url=https://www.nps.gov/sand/learn/news/chief-lean-bear-murder.htm|website=National Park Service|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts of Lean Bear's life are described in the book of folklore, ''By Cheyenne Campfires'', compiled by [[George Bird Grinnell]].

'''Lev Nikolaevich Zadov (Zinkovsky)''' ({{lang-ru|Лев Николаевич ("Лёвка") Задов (Зиньковский)}}) April 11, 1893 - September 25, 1938, [[Kiev]] was chief of military intelligence of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]], and later an [[OGPU]] operative. Born Lev Zadov, he changed his last name to Zinkovsky.

==Early years==
Lev Zadov was born in the [[Jewish agricultural colonies in the Russian Empire|Russian Jewish agricultural colony]] [http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/Colonies_of_Ukraine/Veselaya.htm Veselaya]. About 1898-1900 his family fell on hard times and moved to [[Donetsk|Yuzovka]], where his father found work as a coachman. Zadov graduated at a Jewish [[heder|elementary school]] there and started to work as a manual laborer at a mill, later working at Yuzovka Metallurgical Works.

==Anarchist underground and penal labour==
Lev Zadov joined the Yuzovka Metallurgical Works [[Anarchism|anarchist]] group before 1912. He participated in several armed robberies (the then-popular way for anarchist groups to finance their activities), as well as distributing propaganda pamphlets. He was arrested and convicted in 1913 for robbery of a [[post office]] and sentenced to 8 years of [[penal labour]].

==From February Revolution to Makhno==
Zadov was released after the [[February Revolution]] in February 1917 along with other revolutionary prisoners. He was elected a member of the city [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] in Yuzovka soon after that. Zadov had been instrumental in organizing the anarchist paramilitary force in Yuzovka and joined the [[Red Army]] in Spring 1918 with this group. His junior brother Daniel had been member of the force too. Zadov quickly rose through the ranks and became deputy regiment commander. Zadov's regiment fought advancing German Army and [[Tsentralna Rada]] troops, but was defeated and withdrew toward [[Volgograd|Tsaritsyn]]. The Zadov brothers defected from the Red Army there and returned to the Ukraine to join the anarchists.

==Makhnovist==
Lev Zadov joined [[Nestor Makhno]]'s [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] in August 1918 and quickly became chief of military intelligence of [[the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] (also known as the Black Army). According to numerous eyewitnesses, he was a member of Makhno's inner circle and friend of Makhno's wife. Zadov is credited with personally saving Makhno's life several times during skirmishes with Red Army forces. On August 28, 1921 Zadov organized the escape of remnants of Makhnovist guerrilla forces to [[Romania]]. Romanian security services recruited him and his brother in 1924 to join an anti-Soviet underground group to be sent to the [[Soviet Union]].

==OGPU operative==
After crossing the Soviet-Romanian border Zadov surrendered to Soviet authorities and joined the [[KGB|OGPU]], working in their office in [[Odessa]]. Daniel Zadov (Zotov) became an OGPU operative in [[Tiraspol]]. Zadov had been instrumental in the annihilation of several Anti-Soviet militant groups. He is credited with running one of the most successful Soviet intelligence operations against Romania, and had been awarded with a personal gilded weapon for the "successful fight against counter-revolution". The Zadov brothers were arrested during the [[Great Purge]] in September 1937 and accused of collaboration with Romanian security services. The Zadov brothers' trial took place on September 25, 1938 and lasted only 15 minutes. Both Lev and Daniel were convicted of "collaboration with foreign secret services" and executed by firing squad on September 25, 1938.

==Personal life==
Lev Zadov married Vera Matvienko in 1925 and had a daughter, Alla Zinkovskaya (born 1925), and son, Vadim Zinkovsky (born 1926). Alla Zinkovskaya volunteered to join Red Army in the beginning of the [[Soviet-German War]]. She was killed on June 13, 1942&lt;ref&gt;http://obd-memorial.ru/html/info.htm?id=75799982&lt;/ref&gt; fighting in the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941-1942)|Sevastopol]]. Vadim joined the Red Army in 1944 (age 18) and became a [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]]. Vadim Zinkovsky retired from the [[Soviet Army]] as a [[colonel]] in 1977.

==Cultural depiction==
Lev Zadov is depicted in [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy]]'s "The Road to Calvary" novels as a ruthless but cowardly killer, who participates in numerous atrocities against civilians but shies away from battle engagements. The phrases "Hide your teeth or I'll swing them out" and "I'm Leva Zadov, I'll speak and you'll fear" attributed to him by Tolstoy, became part of Russian [[slang]]. It is proven today that Tolstoy used a pamphlet published in 1924 in [[Kiev]] for his information on Zadov.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7023">[[Robert Hooke]], a major figure of 17th century [[England]], died essentially unmemorialized.  With no immediate family, and with personal disputes with many members of the [[Royal Society]], no memorials were erected in his honor on the occasion of his death.  On the occasion of the [[tercentenary]] of his death in 2003, several efforts were made to address this situation.

== Carved Stone Memorials ==
=== Westminster Abbey ===
[[Image:Inscription-to-Hooke-in-Westminster-Abbey.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Inscription to Hooke in Westminster Abbey.]]

Eddie Smith, former Undermaster and archivist at [[Westminster School]] of which Hooke was a member, worked tirelessly on Hooke's behalf to get him a small memorial in [[Westminster Abbey]]. The work took years but eventually in 2005 one was unveiled.  The inscription reads "Robert Hooke 1703" and is carved from one of the black marble tiles in the floor beneath the Lantern, near the pulpit.  This is appropriate as Hooke was responsible for the laying of this floor.

=== The Monument ===
[[Image:Carved-inscription-on-Monument.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Inscription to Hooke on The Monument, London.]] 
Hooke's name was omitted from the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London]] (known generally as just "The Monument"), erected to commemorate the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, as [[Sir Christopher Wren]] has generally been given credit for the design of this monument.  The new inscription acknowledges Hooke’s role in the monument's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Hooke at last remembered | journal = Petersfield Post | date=7 February 2007| page  = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Monument | publisher = Dept of Planning and Transportation, City of London | year = 2008 | pages = 13–14  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a project to improve the area around the pillar in 2007 it was possible to take a space in the paving for a large ({{convert|16|sqft|m2}}) carved stone.  The stone was quarried at Caithness and made its long journey down to London to be carved at the workshop of Richard Kindersley.  It can be seen from the entrance to the Monument Underground Station and is now included in sightseeing tours for tourists.  

The wording on the memorial was written by [[Dr. Allan Chapman]].

=== St Paul's Cathedral ===
[[Image:Engraved-metal-bookworm.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Inscription to Hooke in St. Paul's Cathedral.]]
Hooke's memorial at [[St. Paul's Cathedral]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Photograph of the new memorial in St. Paul's Cathedral to Robert Hooke | journal = Dome, The magazine of the Friends of St. Paul's Cathedral | issue = 46 | pages = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Robert Hooke - A memorial in St. Paul's | journal = Tablets | issue = 49 | page = 7 | year = Spring 2009 | publisher = Masons livery company }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Memorial to Hooke is highlight of year| journal = Petersfield Post | date=17 December 2008| page  = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is on the wall in the crypt of the cathedral, next to the tomb of Sir Christopher Wren.  The quotation around the edge is from ''[[Micrographia]]'', Hooke's amazing book, published in 1665.

At the bottom of the memorial is an engraved metal bookworm in brass and chrome, recessed into the stone surface.

As the crypt is rather a dark place, a pale, ivory-coloured stone was chosen and the carved letters were painted with blue and brownish-red watercolour to make them more easily readable.

The memorial was dedicated by the Dean of St. Paul's after a special Evensong.

== Painted Memorials ==
Artist Rita Greer has created several new images of Hooke and donated them to various sites.

=== Gresham College, City of London ===
This portrait in oils is the first of a series of memorial portraits. It shows a list of Hooke's interests and skills.  It now hangs in the hall at [[Gresham College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Rita’s portraits of Hooke sought after across UK | journal = Petersfield Post | issue = May 21 | year = 2008 | pages  = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[City of London]].  Hooke was Professor of Geometry for many years at the original Gresham College, at the site where the NatWest Tower now stands.

=== Isle of Wight ===
This painting shows Hooke as a child on the [[Isle of Wight]], holding the model boat he made, with the church of All Saints (where his father was curate) in the background and the [[river medina]].

=== The Open University, Milton Keynes ===
This memorial painting now  hangs in the Seminar Room of the Robert Hooke Science Building at the [[Open University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Unveiling of memorial portrait of Robert Hooke as astronomer and inventor. | journal = Openhouse.  Newspaper for the staff of The Open University | issue = 421 | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Milton Keynes]]. It shows Hooke concerned with minute objects and huge objects.  The emphasis is on astronomy.  It was unveiled in February 2009.

=== Willen Church near Milton Keynes ===
[[Church of St Mary Magdalene, Willen|Church of St Mary Magdalene]] is Hooke's only remaining church, not far from the Open University.  He designed it for Dr. Richard Busby, the first headmaster of Westminster School.  The memorial painting shows the church in the background.

=== University of Oxford ===
This memorial was commissioned for the Master's office at the Department of Engineering Science &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/events/hooke-unveiling.html | title = New Portrait of Robert Hooke, FRS, unveiled | date = 11 June 2009 | publisher = Department of Engineering Science, [[Oxford University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Oxford University]] in 2009.  It shows a portrait of Robert Hooke as an engineer with a few of his inventions – the [[universal joint]], [[wheel barometer]] and [[anchor escapement|pocket watch]]. Other features of his work are the spring, an optic and his microscope with open pages of his book ''Micrographia''.  He holds a chain to make a [[catenary arch]].  Through the window can be seen the [[Bodleian Library]] and the [[Sheldonian Theatre]], linking him with Oxford where he was an undergraduate.

{{New Thought}}
'''Louise Lynn Hay''' (October 8, 1926&amp;nbsp;– August 30, 2017) was an American motivational author and the founder of [[Hay House]]. She authored several [[New Thought]] [[self-help]] books, including the 1984 book, ''[[You Can Heal Your Life]]''.

==Biography==
Born Helen Vera Lunney in Los Angeles to parents Henry John Lunney (1901–1998) and Veronica Chwala (1894–1985), Hay recounted her life story in an interview with Mark Oppenheimer of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in May 2008.&lt;ref name="Oppenheimer"/&gt; In it, Hay stated that she was born in [[Los Angeles]] to a poor mother who remarried Louise's violent stepfather Ernest Carl Wanzenreid (1903-1992), who physically abused her and her mother. According to Hay, when she was about 5, she was raped by a neighbor. At 15, she dropped out of [[University High School (Los Angeles)|University High School]] in Los Angeles without a diploma, became pregnant and, on her 16th birthday, gave up her newborn baby girl for adoption. She then moved to Chicago, where she worked in low-paying jobs. In 1950, she moved on again, to New York. At this point she changed her first name, and began a career as a fashion model. She achieved success, working for [[Bill Blass]], [[Oleg Cassini]], and [[Pauline Trigère]]. In 1954, she married the English businessman Andrew Hay (1928-2001); after 14 years of marriage, she felt devastated when he left her for another woman, Sharman Douglas (1928-1996).&lt;ref name="Oppenheimer"/&gt;

Hay said that about this time she found the First Church of Religious Science on 48th Street, which taught her the transformative power of thought. Hay revealed that here she studied the [[New Thought]] works of authors like [[Florence Scovel Shinn]], who claimed that positive thinking could change people’s material circumstances, and the [[Religious Science]] founder [[Ernest Holmes]], who taught that [[Optimism|positive thinking]] could heal the body.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Ernest|title=The Science of Mind|year=1926|publisher=Robert M. McBride &amp; Co.|location=New York|isbn=0-87477-865-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By Hay's account, in the early 1970s she became a Religious Science practitioner. In this role she led people in spoken [[Affirmations (New Age)|affirmations]], which she believes would cure their illnesses, and became popular as a workshop leader. She also recalled how she had studied [[Transcendental Meditation]] with the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] at the [[Maharishi University of Management|Maharishi International University]] in [[Fairfield, Iowa]].&lt;ref name="Oppenheimer"/&gt;

Hay described how in 1977 or 1978 she was diagnosed with "incurable" [[cervical cancer]], and how she came to the conclusion that by holding on to her resentment for her childhood abuse and rape she had contributed to its onset. She reported how she had refused conventional medical treatment, and began a regime of forgiveness, coupled with therapy, nutrition, [[reflexology]], and occasional colonic [[enema]]s. She claimed in the interview that she rid herself of the cancer by this method, but, while swearing to its truth, admitted that she had outlived every doctor who could confirm this story.&lt;ref name="Oppenheimer"&gt;Mark Oppenheimer (May 4, 2008), [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/magazine/04Hay-t.html "The Queen of the New Age"], ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', retrieved May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Hay wrote her first book, ''Heal Your Body'', which began as a small pamphlet containing a list of different bodily ailments and their “probable” metaphysical causes.&lt;ref name="Oppenheimer"/&gt; This pamphlet was later enlarged and extended into her book ''You Can Heal Your Life'', published in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/You-Can-Heal-Your-Life/dp/0937611018|title=Amazon.com|last=|first=|date=|website=Amazon|publisher=|archiveurl=|archive-date=|deadurl=|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, it was second on the New York Times miscellaneous paperback best-sellers list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/feb/24/new-york-times-best-sellers/ New York Times Best-Sellers] ''The New York Times'', February 23, 2008.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time she began leading support groups for people living with [[HIV/AIDS]], which she called ''"Hay Rides"''.&lt;ref name="Oppenheimer"/&gt; These grew from a few people in her living room to hundreds of men in a large hall in [[West Hollywood, California]]. Her work with AIDS patients drew fame and she was invited to appear on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]'' in the same week, in March 1988. Following this, ''[[You Can Heal Your Life]]'' immediately landed on the New York Times best-seller list. More than 50 million copies sold around the world in over 30 languages&lt;ref name="Oppenheimer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2007/04/23/hlouise123.xml "Louise Hay Interview"] ''The Telegraph'', April 23, 2007.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429000056/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fhealth%2F2007%2F04%2F23%2Fhlouise123.xml |date=April 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it also has been made into a movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youcanhealyourlifemovie.com/|title=You Can Heal Your Life: The Movie|publisher=|access-date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''You Can Heal Your Life'' is also included in the book ''50 Self-Help Classics''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.butler-bowdon.com/youcanheal.html Review of ''You Can Heal Your Life''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216083710/http://www.butler-bowdon.com/youcanheal.html |date=2008-12-16 }}, ''50 Self-Help Classics''&lt;/ref&gt; for being significant in its field.

Hay wrote, on page 225 of her book, (December 2008 printing) that the book has "...&amp;nbsp;sold more than thirty five million copies".&lt;ref&gt;[[List of best-selling books#Between 30 million and 50 million copies]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced in 2011 that ''You Can Heal your Life'' had reached 40 million sales.&lt;ref&gt;

Louise Hay died in her sleep on the morning of August 30, 2017 at age 90.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theeventchronicle.com/metaphysics/spiritual/louise-hay-transitioned-morning-august-30-2017/#|title=Louise Hay transitioned the morning of August 30, 2017|date=2017-09-01|work=The Event Chronicle|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing==
In 1984, Hay established the [[Hay House]] publishing firm. In 1988 [[Reid Tracy]] joined the company as an accountant and would eventually become its CEO. The business flourished and attracted various writers. {{As of|2015}} Hay House is the primary publisher of books and audio books by over 130 authors, including [[Deepak Chopra]] and [[Doreen Virtue]], as well as many books by [[Wayne Dyer]]. [[Hay House]] also publishes the teachings of "Abraham" as channeled through [[Esther Hicks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hayhouse.co.uk/authors/5897/hay-house|title=Hay House - Author Biography|author=|date=|website=www.hayhouse.co.uk|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to running her publishing company, Hay ran a charitable organization called the Hay Foundation, which she founded in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hayfoundation.org/|title=The Hay Foundation - Founded In 1986 By Louise Hay|author=|date=|website=Hay Foundation|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a movie about Louise Hay's life was released, titled ''You Can Heal Your Life''. In Hay's own words on the film's official Web site: "This movie is the story of my life, my teachings, and how I've applied the principles of my teachings to my own life." The movie also features notable speakers and authors in the field of [[personal development]] including [[Gregg Braden]], [[Wayne Dyer]], [[Gay Hendricks]], [[Esther Hicks|Esther and Jerry Hicks]], and [[Doreen Virtue]]; it was directed by Emmy Award-winning director [[Michael A. Goorjian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youcanhealyourlifemovie.com/|title=You Can Heal Your Life: The Movie|publisher=|access-date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Louise Hay won a Minerva Award at [[The Women's Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''murder of Shalhevet Pass''' was a shooting attack which was carried out on March 26, 2001, in Hebron, [[West Bank]], in which a [[Palestinian Arabs|Palestinian]] [[sniper]] killed the ten-month-old [[Israel]]i [[infant]] Shalhevet Pass. The event shocked the Israeli public, partly because an investigation ruled that the sniper had deliberately aimed for the baby.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; According to Deborah Sontag of [[New York Times]], the murder became a "potent Israeli symbol as an innocent victim of the raging violence".&lt;ref name=funeral&gt;Deborah Sontag, [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/02/world/israeli-baby-s-funeral-becomes-focus-of-settler-militancy.html Israeli Baby's Funeral Becomes Focus of Settler Militancy]. nytimes.com, 2 April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The murder==
On March 26, 2001, at 4:00 pm, Shalhevet was shot in her [[stroller]] while her parents were accompanying her from a parking lot by the Avraham Avinu neighborhood in [[Hebron]], where she and her family lived.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6aLsz14aKJsC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Shalhevet+Pass&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=szqBTaOZBpKqsAOj0fHpAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Shalhevet%20Pass&amp;f=false|title=Center of the storm: a case study of human rights abuses in Hebron District|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|ISBN=1-56432-260-2|year= 2001|author=Peter Bouckaert|accessdate=16 March 2011|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=education&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.il/children/page_23.htm|quote=In the afternoon, Yitzhak and Orya Pass took a walk with their daughter Shalhevet from their home in the Beit Hadassah neighborhood to the Avraham Avinu neighborhood where Orya’s parents lived.

Press accounts indicated that the playground was very busy at the time, because a load of new sand had recently been delivered.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; According to unconfirmed accounts, another child was grazed by a bullet and two more had bullets pass through their clothing.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Shalhevet Tchia'a Pass tombstonein.jpg|thumb|Tombstone of Shalhevet Pass]]
The murder, which occurred during the [[Second Intifada]], produced vocal outrage in Israel and abroad. The nation mourned the killing of the baby.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] condemned the attack and sent his condolences to the Pass family. Sharon also stated that he saw the Palestinian Authority as responsible for the attack. The Jewish community in Hebron demanded that the Israeli army reoccupy the Abu Sneineh neighborhood in Hebron, and the Pass family even stated that they would not bury their baby until the IDF would reoccupy the Abu Sneineh neighborhood.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

===Capture and trial of killer===
The Palestinian Authority initially arrested the sniper but released him after a short while. On 9 December 2002 the [[Shin Bet]] managed to capture the sniper – the [[Tanzim]] member Mahmud Amru. In December 2004 a military court convicted the killer and sentenced him to three life terms.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Monitoring Newsfile, 16 December 2004, quoting Ma'ariv web site, Tel Aviv, in English; accessed 12 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baby's murderer gets three life sentences|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=16 December 2004|author=Margot Dudkevitch|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Israeli government, an investigation concluded that the sniper had intentionally targeted the baby.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=education&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.il/children/page_23.htm|quote=On Monday, 26 March 2001, a Palestinian sniper aimed his rifle and opened fire at 10-month old Shalhevet Pass in Hebron, while she was lying in her stroller. Shalhevet was killed by a bullet to the head.|title=Target: Israeli Children|publisher=[[Education Minister of Israel|Israeli Ministry of Education]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023202452/http://www.education.gov.il/children/page_23.htm|archivedate=23 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] said: &lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that they could pick off the baby and then the father makes this a hideous, deliberate, cold-blooded murder. Snipers are not just gun-toting youth... If Arafat had wanted, the sniper would not have been there.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the verdict the judges expressed their shock of the brutality of the murder:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was enough for one bullet, fired from a sniper rifle, to end the life of the infant Shalhevet Pass, who up to that event was unknown to the wide public, and just lived her life as all other children, until one day as the evening came she was hit in her head, and she died, and Shalhevet whom was still small and in her infant stage, was sentenced to death by a vile killer whom intentionally, using a [[Telescopic sight]], pulled the trigger. The picture of the shot baby is on our table, is engraved in our minds and does not give peace to our souls. We cannot understand and we cannot accept the unbearable ease with which the killer decided to harm a helpless person... We the judges are only humans and we cannot see anything else but the image which emerges in our senses, an image full of hate, blood and bereavement. We must not accept this image and we need to do everything we can to condemn it."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The child's father, Yitzchak Pass, later joined the [[Bat Ayin|Bat Ayin Underground]] terrorist group which planned to blow up a Palestinian girls' school in East Jerusalem and was eventually arrested and convicted for possession of 10 pounds of explosive. He served a two-year prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/83786#.Vcuo_3FVh8M Pass released from prison], israelnationalnews.com; accessed 12 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] ran the story with the headline "Jewish toddler dies in West Bank"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-42968508.html|title=Jewish Toddler Dies in West Bank|agency=Associated Press|date=26 March 2001|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was criticized by Joshua Levy in his book "The Agony of the Promised Land" for downplaying the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NDFVo91gN8MC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=shalhevet+pass+associated+press&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TSK37wvS52&amp;sig=1eLxv3DHi7hYbNzIBbw26o1Uwuo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AsfsUKnNAbH62AWprICQAw&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=shalhevet%20pass%20associated%20press&amp;f=false|title=The Agony of the Promised Land|author=Joshua Levy|publisher=iUniverse|year=2004|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nick Herbert''' (born September 7, 1936) is an American physicist and author, best known for his book ''[[Quantum Reality]]''.

==Biography==

Herbert studied [[engineering physics]] at [[Ohio State University]], graduating in 1959. He received a [[Ph.D.]] in physics from [[Stanford University]] in 1967 for work on nuclear scattering experiments. After a one-year teaching job at [[Monmouth College]] in Illinois, Herbert held a number of posts in industry. The most illustrious of these was senior physicist at [[Memorex]] Corporation in [[Santa Clara, California]], where he developed new magnetic materials, as well as magnetic, electrostatic and optical measuring devices, and carried out theoretical work on [[Electron diffraction#Limitations|Lorentz microscopy]]. He was also senior physicist at [[SCM Corporation|Smith-Corona Marchant Corporation]] in Palo Alto, California where he developed a new theory of [[xerographic]] process and worked on early developments in [[ink jet|ink jet printing]].{{sfn|Herbert|2011}}{{sfn|Kaiser|2011|pp=52–54}}

While employed in industry, Herbert was part of the [[Fundamental Fysiks Group]] at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], founded in May 1975 by [[Elizabeth Rauscher]] and George Weissmann.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kaiser|Kaiser, David]]. ''How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture and the Quantum Revival''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2011, pp. xv–xvii, 43ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's initial interest was in the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]], the [[EPR paradox]], and [[Bell's inequality]], but members pursued diverse interests that lay outside of mainstream physics, exploring [[psychedelic drugs]], [[psi phenomena]], the nature of [[consciousness]], and speculative connections of these areas with quantum physics.  During the 1970s and 1980s, Herbert and Saul-Paul Sirag organized a yearly [[Esalen Institute|Esalen]] Seminar on the Nature of Reality, bringing together participants to discuss the interpretation of quantum mechanics.{{sfn|Kaiser|2011|p=116}}  With Richard Shoup of [[Xerox PARC]], Herbert constructed a "Metaphase Typewriter", a "quantum operated" device whose purpose was "to communicate with disembodied spirits".{{sfn|Herbert|2011}}  Despite many tests, including an attempt to contact the spirit of [[Harry Houdini]] on the hundredth anniversary of his birth, the group reported no success with the device.{{sfn|Kaiser|2011|p=88}}

Herbert supports a [[holistic]] interpretation of quantum physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southerncrossreview.org/16/herbert.essay.htm|title=HOLISTIC PHYSICS - OR - AN INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM TANTRA|website=southerncrossreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has argued for "quantum animism" in which mind permeates the world at every level.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Harvey ''Animism: respecting the living world'' 2005, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; [[Werner Krieglstein]] wrote regarding his quantum animism:

{{cquote|Herbert's quantum animism differs from traditional animism in that it avoids assuming a dualistic model of mind and matter. Traditional dualism assumes that some kind of spirit inhabits a body and makes it move, a ghost in the machine. Herbert's quantum animism presents the idea that every natural system has an inner life, a conscious center, from which it directs and observes its action.&lt;ref&gt;Werner J. Krieglstein ''Compassion: a new philosophy of the other'' 2002, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1981, Herbert proposed ''FLASH'', a scheme for sending signals faster than the [[speed of light]] using [[quantum entanglement]].{{sfn|Herbert|1982}}  Of this proposal, [[quantum computing]] pioneer [[Asher Peres]] wrote, "I was the referee who approved the publication of Nick Herbert’s ''FLASH paper'', knowing perfectly well that it was wrong. I explain why my decision was the correct one, and I briefly review the progress to which it led."  Chief among the results that Peres claimed stemmed from a refutation of Herbert's proposal was the [[no-cloning theorem]], proved by [[William Wootters|Wootters]], [[Wojciech H. Zurek|Zurek]], and [[Dennis Dieks|Dieks]].{{sfn|Peres|2003}}

'''Paul Foot''' (born 24 December 1973) is an English comedian. Foot is known for his musings, rants, "disturbances" and apparent aversion to pop culture. The ''[[Daily Express]]'' likened him to "a rare exotic bird",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goulder |first=Claudia |url=https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/theatre/120596/Paul-Foot-By-The-Yard-The-Underbelly-Edinburgh-Festival|title=Paul Foot – By The Yard: The Underbelly, Edinburgh Festival |work=[[Daily Express]] |date=15 August 2009 |access-date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and six national newspapers including ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The Age]]'' have described him as "a comedy genius".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/cultural-life-rhod-gilbert-comedian-2177716.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Cultural Life: Rhod Gilbert, comedian | date=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ash in the Attic"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/comedy/ash-in-the-attic-20110406-1d3c6.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Ash in the Attic | date=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulfoot.tv/press_quotes.php |title=Press Quotes |publisher=Paulfoot.tv |access-date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Foot was born and raised in [[Amersham]], Buckinghamshire, and has a younger brother.&lt;ref name="Timeout"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/features/2022/Paul_Foot-Interview.html|title=Paul Foot: Interview|last=Hay|first=Malcolm|date=25 September 2006|work=Time Out London|access-date=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCLeeds&gt;{{BBC programme|id=p028lpwz|title=BBC Leeds – One on One, 28/10/2014, Paul Foot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied mathematics at [[Merton College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Indie"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/comedy-adrian-mole-meets-emo-phillips-1291494.html|title=Comedy: Adrian Mole meets Emo Phillips|last=Conchie|first=Peter|date=1 November 1997|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent Print|access-date=14 October 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his studies that he first started performing stand-up.&lt;ref name="Futon"&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Twelve Funniest Comedy Acts in the World Are Revealed on NBC's ''Last Comic Standing''|publisher=NBC|date=7 July 2008 |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20080707nbc01 |accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, Foot has refused to discuss his years at Oxford or former pursuits as a mathematics student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatmagazine.co.uk/taking-comedy-to-the-next-level-an-interview-with-paul-foot|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222163706/http://www.beatmagazine.co.uk/taking-comedy-to-the-next-level-an-interview-with-paul-foot |title=Taking comedy to the next level – an interview with Paul Foot|archivedate=22 February 2014|work=Beat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating from Oxford in 1995, Foot was head-hunted by a computer software company in the run-up to the [[dot-com bubble]], however he loathed the industry: "I had to read manuals on HTML and just write websites from scratch. None of us really knew what we were doing".&lt;ref name="leedsstudent.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jackcullen.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/interview-with-comedian-paul-foot.html|title=Jack of Hearts: An Interview with Comedian Paul Foot |author=Jack Cullen}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started to pursue a career in comedy by doing [[open mic]] slots at various venues.&lt;ref name="leedsstudent.org"/&gt;

He is openly gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Foot |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoW415APMzY&amp;t=1m27s |title=Paul Foot – Levels of Homophobia |via=YouTube |date=13 February 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as "a little bit vegetarian", but has said that occasionally he does return to eating meat due to nutrition-related health issues.&lt;ref name=BBCLeeds /&gt; He has stated on his video log that he has [[prosopagnosia|face blindness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Foot|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8aMHdzmpps|title=Paul Foot Video Log – Intellectual Rigour|via=YouTube|date=11 December 2015|access-date=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live performances==
Foot frequently performs live, with resident slots at various London comedy clubs, and his fans sometimes demand shows in particularly obscure parts of Britain. He usually takes a show to the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] such as ''By the Yard'' (2009), ''Ash in the Attic'' (2010) (which was directed by [[Noel Fielding]]) and ''Words ''(2013).

Following Edinburgh, Foot usually tours Britain with his current show before taking it to Australia after Christmas for the Australian festival circuit. He has also given runs at Montreal Comedy festival as well as selling out at venues in Sweden.

In 2003, Foot and [[Russell Brand]] appeared in a double act at Cafe Royal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festivalhighlights.com/2004/paulfoot/PaulFootPR.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308053439/http://www.festivalhighlights.com/2004/paulfoot/PaulFootPR.pdf |title=Paul Foot: Simple Pleasures |archivedate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foot's style of comedy had a strong influence on Brand, who was inspired by Foot's eccentric hair, quirky mannerisms and love for florid language. In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Paul MacInnes wrote about their similarities in an article that explored the notion of "copycat comedians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/sep/11/stewart-lee-jack-whitehall-comedians | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Paul | last=MacInnes | title=Stewart Lee, Jack Whitehall and the trouble with copycat comedians | date=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Dessau made similar observations in ''[[Evening Standard|The Standard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bruce |last=Dessau |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/comedy/review-23432870-cult-stardom-could-be-a-hairs-breadth-away.do |title=Cult stardom could be a hair's breadth away |work=[[London Evening Standard]] |date=17 January 2008 |access-date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a sector of Foot's fan base felt Brand had stolen Foot's act, the two comedians have remained friends. In 2012, Brand made a special appearance at one of Foot's ''Secret Shows'' and they improvised a play in which Brand played Foot and Foot played actress [[Angela Lansbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Foot |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplegHsxin0 |title=Paul Foot and Russell Brand Celebrity Coach Trip |via=YouTube |date=7 June 2012 |access-date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Ash in the Attic''==
Foot's 2010 Edinburgh show ''Ash in the Attic'' was directed by comedian [[Noel Fielding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donaldson |first=Brian |url=http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/article/28003-paul-foot-ash-in-the-attic/ |title=Paul Foot – Ash in the Attic |publisher=Edinburgh Festival |date=9 August 2010 |access-date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/article/28474-paul-foot-and-noel-fielding/|title=Paul Foot &amp; Noel Fielding|date=17 August 2010|publisher=List.co.uk|access-date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enjoyed two sell-out runs at London's [[Soho Theatre]] in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allgigs.co.uk/view/event/341862/Paul_Foot_Soho_Theatre_Studio_London_4_February_2011.html |title=Buy Paul Foot Tickets for All 2014 and 2015 UK Tour Dates and Concerts |publisher=All Gigs |access-date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ash in the Attic'' was then taken to Melbourne for the 2011 [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] as part of the official gala selection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2011/season/shows/paul-foot-ash-in-the-attic|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928015911/http://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2011/season/shows/paul-foot-ash-in-the-attic|title=Paul Foot – Ash in the Attic – Melbourne International Comedy Festival 2011|archivedate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it received a 5-star review in ''The Age''.&lt;ref name="Ash in the Attic"/&gt; Australian Chortle wrote in their review that ''Ash in the Attic'' was "One of the best comedy shows ever to have been performed in Melbourne".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.chortle.com/shows/melbourne_2011/p/18908/paul_foot%3A_ash_in_the_attic/review|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918223626/http://au.chortle.com/shows/melbourne_2011/p/18908/paul_foot%3A_ash_in_the_attic/review|title=Paul Foot: Ash In The Attic' review : Chortle : The Australia and NZ Comedy Guide|author=Powder Blue Internet Business Solutions|archivedate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CD of the show was released, and can be bought from his website, standard online shops, and from Foot at tour shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulfoot.tv/shop/cd/ |title=Ash in the Attic CD |publisher=Paulfoot.tv |access-date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Still Life''==
Foot performed eight secret London previews for his 2011 Edinburgh show ''Still Life'' before taking it to the Fringe where the show had a sell-out run at the Underbelly.&lt;ref name="paulfoot.tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulfoot.tv/show_diary.php |title=Show diary |publisher=Paulfoot.tv |date=31 October 2011 |access-date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foot toured the UK in autumn 2011 with ''Still Life'' starting at the Soho Theatre on 26 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelowry.com/event/the-paul-foot-experience|title=Event Detail – The Paul Foot Experience – The Paul Foot Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foot took ''Still Life'' to the 2012 [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] where he starred in the [[Comedy Festival Gala]] on Australia's [[Network Ten]] and was nominated for a [[Barry Award (for comedy)|Barry Award]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/apr/17/uk-comedians-melbourne-comedy-festival | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Matt | last=Trueman | title=UK comedians lead the way at Melbourne festival | date=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Still Life'' also featured at the [[Just for Laughs]] festival in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebirminghampress.com/2012/10/paul-foot-the-comedian-at-the-glee/|title=Paul Foot – the comedian – at The Glee|work=The Birmingham Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poster image for ''Still Life'' is an original artwork, a portrait of Foot amidst various fruits, by Victoria Brook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulfoot.tv/page5.php |title=Shop |publisher=Paulfoot.tv |date=19 December 2011 |access-date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kenny Larch Is Dead==
Foot's 2012 Edinburgh show was called ''Kenny Larch Is Dead''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/edinburgh_fringe_2012/p/20362/paul_foot%3A_kenny_larch_is_dead |title=Paul Foot: Kenny Larch Is Dead's description |publisher=Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As ever with Foot, the show had nothing to do with the title. Following the Fringe the sell-out show toured Britain, before being taken to the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2013/season/shows/kenny-larch-is-dead-paul-foot Kenny Larch is Dead, Paul Foot | Melbourne International Comedy Festival 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323051033/http://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2013/season/shows/kenny-larch-is-dead-paul-foot |date=23 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show won the Best of Fest award at the Sydney Comedy festival,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/may/13/paul-foot-sydney-comedy-festival-award | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Matt | last=Trueman | title=Paul Foot wins Sydney Comedy festival's international award | date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Best International Show at the Perth comedy awards.

==Secret shows==
In September 2006, Foot started a regular London-based solo variety show called ''Paul Foot's Comedy for Connoisseurs''.  The title comes from the name given to his fans, "The Guild of Paul Foot Connoisseurs", for whom Foot arranges "secret" events advertised only via his official website and mailing list.&lt;ref name=Timeout/&gt;&lt;ref name="Secretshows"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paulfoot.tv/secret.html|title=Paul Foot's Secret Shows|last=Foot|first=Paul|work=The Guild of Paul Foot Connoisseurs|accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the secret shows Foot often enters a surreal territory, taking on the personae of his own character creations such as "Penny" and "Skeleton Johnson", and sometimes improvising elaborate mini-dramas in which he plays all of the parts. Some of Foot's characters feature on his website which also has a secret page for his Guild of Connoisseurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulfoot.tv/ |title=The Guild of Paul Foot Connoisseurs |publisher=Paulfoot.tv |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foot's television appearances in 2010 introduced a new generation to his style of comedy, leading some "Connoisseurs of The Guild of Paul Foot Connoisseurs" unable to attend Foot's Secret Shows due to this new wave of popularity with a younger, student demographic booking them out. Foot addressed this problem by organising his first "Secret Secret Show" for his longest-serving fans. The show was not advertised anywhere on his website.&lt;ref name="paulfoot.tv"/&gt;

==The Paul Foot Festival==
{{BLP sources section|date=September 2016}}
In 2009, Paul Foot hosted his own all-day festival at Bethnal Green Working Men's Club in East London with the help of arts and music collective HungaMunga. Sketches included 'Foot of the Yard', a whodunnit, an Invisible Man Contest, Flamingo I-Spy, an Erotic Menu, and Paul's Rants. HungaMunga provided lots of arts and crafts materials and activities. Foot also painted portraits of members of the audience. The festival also included Paul's Protégé's featuring the comedians Tom Bell and Joel Dommett. Musical performers at the festival were Birmingham gonzo-ska band Misty's Big Adventure and Antony Elvin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnRD-DKDc60|title=Misty's Big Adventure – The Wising Up Song (part)|last=jfinchiva|date=13 July 2009|accessdate=13 April 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Foot filmed a series of TV advertisements for Virgin Mobile in Australia. He helped to devise his character in the campaign called "Robin Da Hood", a bizarre fusion of medieval eccentricities and modern-day Australian urbanity. The first of these adverts featured an emergency phone conversation between Foot and head of the [[Virgin Group]] Sir [[Richard Branson]].

==Awards==
In 1997, Foot won both the [[BBC New Comedy Awards|BBC New Stand-up Award]] and the ''Daily Telegraph'' Open Mic Award, and was a finalist for the [[So You Think You're Funny]] award for newcomers.&lt;ref name="Chortle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/p/403/paul_foot|title=Paul Foot|work=Chortle: The UK Comedy Guide|access-date=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, he was nominated for the Perrier Best Newcomer Award in Edinburgh.

In 2011, Foot was nominated for a [[Barry Award (for comedy)|Barry Award]] at the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Craig |last=Platt |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/comedy/blogs/last-laugh/barry-award-nominees-announced-20110417-1djfk.html |title=2011 Barry Award nominees |work=[[Brisbane Times]] |access-date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Foot won the top award at the Sydney Comedy festival for Kenny Larch Is Dead, which won the best show award.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Paul Foot Podcast==
Since 2009, Foot has released a podcast, the ''Paul Foot Podcast''. It was originally the highlights from his show on [[Resonance FM]], and featured fellow stand-up comedian [[Joel Dommett]], among other regulars. After the Resonance FM show ended, a few episodes were released independently up to May 2010. Episodes of the podcast then became more sporadic, being released every few months or so; these episodes included guests such as [[Trevor Lock]] and Paul's tour support act Malcolm Head, as well as recordings from Paul's Secret Shows. Starting in 2015, the podcast started being released far more regularly once again, with another stand-up comedian, Tom Mayhew, as co-host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paulfoot.podbean.com/ |title=Podcast homepage |publisher=Paulfoot.tv |access-date=5 February 2016|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Marshall''' (born 12 May 1971 in [[Nottingham]], [[United Kingdom]]) is a former professional [[squash (sport)|squash]] player from [[England]].

With his unique double-handed playing style, Marshall finished runner-up to the great [[Pakistan]]i player [[Jansher Khan]] at the [[World Open (squash)|World Open]] in 1994 and the [[British Open Squash Championships|British Open]] in 1995. When he reached the World No. 2 ranking behind Jansher in November 1994, many observers felt he seemed a strong candidate to displace the aging Pakistani champion as World No. 1. However, in 1995, Marshall was afflicted with [[glandular fever]], the effects of which meant he was unable to play top-level squash for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Squash: Marshall's rebellion within  |first=Iain |last=Fletcher |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/squash-marshalls-rebellion-within-1235500.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=12 October 1997 |accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall returned to the professional tour in 1997, re-claiming his place in the England squad which went on to win the [[World Team Squash Championships]] title in [[Malaysia]]. He broke back into the world's top-10 in 1999, and won his third [[British National Squash Championships|British National Championship]] title in February 2000. He was protecting a remarkable record, having been unbeaten in that event since December 1989.

== Early career ==
Marshall won British junior titles at all age-groups (under-12, under-14, under-16 and under-19). He first became England's No.1 in November 1991, holding the position unchallenged for four years.

In 1989, Marshall won the British Open U19. The following year, he became World Masters U23 Champion.

His first full year of international competition was 1991, but it was in the 1994-95 season that Marshall's promise was most powerfully demonstrated. He was a finalist in five [[PSA Super Series]] events leading up to and including the 1995 British Open.

Marshall was British and European No 1 for several years.

== After retiring from the professional tour ==
Marshall released an [[autobiography]] about his battle against [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] in 2001 entitled ''Shattered: A Champion's Fight Against a Mystery Illness''.&lt;ref name="marshall2001"&gt;{{cite book |last= Marshall |first= Peter |title= Shattered: A Champion's Fight Against a Mystery Illness |publisher= [[Mainstream Publishing]] |date=March 2001 |isbn= 978-1-84018-395-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall has a BSc in Physiotherapy from the [[University of Nottingham]] and an Executive MBA from  [[Imperial College London]]. He currently works for [[Ernst &amp; Young]].

In 2008, Marshall won the Over-35 British National Championship in Manchester. He also won the British Open Masters Over-40 in 2016 and 2018.

Marshall is an Ambassador for Access Sport, a charity focused on providing children from disadvantaged areas with access to local sports and promoting the real difference sport can make within deprived communities.

He is also a trustee for the England Squash Foundation, a national charity with a vision to enhance young people's lives through squash.

In May 2015, Marshall was given a Lifetime Achievement Award at the World Squash Awards for his achievements, continued support and commitment to the game.

'''Karl Paul Reinhold Niebuhr''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|aɪ|n|h|oʊ|l|d|_|ˈ|n|iː|b|ʊər}}; June 21, 1892{{spaced ndash}}June 1, 1971) was an American [[Reformed]] [[theology|theologian]], [[ethics|ethicist]], commentator on politics and public affairs, and professor at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] for more than 30 years. Niebuhr was one of America's leading public intellectuals for several decades of the 20th century and received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1964. A public theologian, he wrote and spoke frequently about the intersection of religion, politics, and public policy, with his most influential books including ''[[Moral Man and Immoral Society]]'' and ''[[The Nature and Destiny of Man]]''.  The latter is ranked #18 of the Top 100 non-fiction books of the twentieth century by [[Modern Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-nonfiction/ |title=100 Best Nonfiction |publisher=Modern Library |date=1998 |accessdate=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Bacevich]] labelled Niebuhr's book ''The Irony of American History'' "the most important book ever written on U.S. foreign policy."&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"&gt;{{cite news |author=Brian Urquhart |date=March 26, 2009 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/mar/26/what-you-can-learn-from-reinhold-niebuhr/?pagination=false |title=What You Can Learn from Reinhold Niebuhr |newspaper=The New York Review of Books |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] described Niebuhr as "the most influential American theologian of the 20th century"&lt;ref name="Arthur"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/22/opinion/reinhold-niebuhr-s-long-shadow.html | work=The New York Times | first=Arthur | last=Schlesinger Jr | title=Reinhold Niebuhr's Long Shadow | date=June 22, 1992 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208083832/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/22/opinion/reinhold-niebuhr-s-long-shadow.html |archivedate=December 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' posthumously called Niebuhr "the greatest Protestant theologian in America since [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1991/issue32/3236.html?start=2 |title=Friends He Met in America: Reinhold Niebuhr |work=Christian History |date=October 1, 1991 |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting as a minister with working-class sympathies in the 1920s and sharing with many other ministers a commitment to [[pacifism]] and [[socialism]], his thinking evolved during the 1930s to [[neo-orthodoxy|neo-orthodox]] realist theology as he developed the philosophical perspective known as [[Christian realism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert McAfee Brown|Brown, Robert McAfee]], (1986).  ''The Essential Reinhold Niebuhr: Selected Essays and Addresses'', Yale University Press, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=eB6MyJk2fvQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=reinhold+niebuhr+neo-orthodox&amp;ots=-fAjkoYC8E&amp;sig=Awd4H8FGTlIiDutlrR9sQgpuAQI#v=onepage&amp;q=f%3Dfalse&amp;f=false  xv-xiv.]&lt;/ref&gt; He attacked utopianism as ineffectual for dealing with reality, writing in ''The Children of Light and the Children of Darkness'' (1944), "Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible; but man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary." Niebuhr's realism deepened after 1945 and led him to support American efforts to confront Soviet communism around the world. A powerful speaker, he was one of the most influential thinkers of the 1940s and 1950s in public affairs.&lt;ref name="Arthur"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/books/review/18schlesinger.html?pagewanted=all |author=Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. |title=Forgetting Reinhold Niebuhr |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 18, 2005 |accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr battled with religious liberals over what he called their naïve views of the contradictions of human nature and the optimism of the [[Social Gospel]], and battled with the religious conservatives over what he viewed as their naïve view of scripture and their narrow definition of "true religion". During this time he was viewed by many as the intellectual rival of [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunypress.edu/p-1552-reinhold-niebuhr-and-john-dewey.aspx |title=Reinhold Niebuhr and John Dewey: An American Odyssey, Daniel F. Rice — Author |date=March 1993 |publisher=SUNY Press |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niebuhr's contributions to political philosophy include utilizing the resources of theology to argue for [[political realism]]. His work has also significantly influenced [[international relations theory]], leading many scholars to move away from [[idealism in international relations|idealism]] and embrace [[Realism (international relations)|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;"[[Political realism]]" in foreign policy emphasizes national interest and is opposed to "idealism". See Michael Doyle, ''Ways of War and Peace: Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism'' (1997){{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of scholars, including political scientists, political historians, and theologians, have noted his influence on their thinking.

Richard Niebuhr]].

==Early life and education==
Niebuhr was born in [[Wright City, Missouri]], the son of [[German American|German immigrants]] Gustav Niebuhr, and his wife, Lydia (née Hosto).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Yun Jung Moon |year=2009 |url=http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/bce/mwt_themes_770_niebuhrreinhold.htm |title=Reinhold Niebuhr (1892–1971) |work=Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Modern Western Theology |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a [[Evangelical Synod of North America|German Evangelical]] pastor; his denomination was the American branch of the established [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Prussian Church Union]] in Germany. It is now part of the [[United Church of Christ]]. The family spoke German at home. His brother [[H. Richard Niebuhr]] also became a famous theological ethicist, and his sister Hulda Niebuhr became a divinity professor in Chicago. The Niebuhr family moved to [[Lincoln, Illinois]], in 1902 when Gustav Niebuhr became pastor of Lincoln's St. John's [[German Evangelical Synod]] church. Reinhold Niebuhr first served as pastor of a church when he served from April to September 1913 as interim minister of St. John's following his father's death.&lt;ref name="Reinhold Niebuhr A Biography"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Richard|title=Reinhold Niebuhr|year=1985|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-06-250343-X |pages=5–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niebuhr attended [[Elmhurst College]] in [[Illinois]] and graduated in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Elmhurst College has erected a statue in his honor.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at [[Eden Theological Seminary]] in [[Webster Groves, Missouri]], where, as he admitted, he was deeply influenced by Samuel D. Press in "biblical and systematic subjects",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lemert|first=Charles|title=Why Niebuhr Matters|year=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0-300-17542-4|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yale Divinity School]], where he earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1914 and a Master of Arts degree the following year. He always regretted not taking a doctorate. He said that Yale gave him intellectual liberation from the localism of his German-American upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Fox |title=Reinhold Niebuhr: A Biography |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
In 1931 Niebuhr married [[Ursula Keppel-Compton]]. She was a member of the Church of England and was educated at Oxford University in theology and history. She met Niebuhr while studying for her master's degree at Union Theological Seminary. For many years, she was on faculty at [[Barnard College]] (the women's college of [[Columbia University]]) where she helped establish and then chaired the religious studies department. The Niebuhrs had two children, Christopher Niebuhr and Elisabeth Niebuhr Sifton. Ursula Niebuhr left evidence in her professional papers at the Library of Congress showing that she co-authored some of her husband's later writings.&lt;ref&gt;Rebekah Miles, "Uncredited: Was Ursula Niebuhr Reinhold's Coauthor?" ''The Christian Century'', January 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detroit==
In 1915, Niebuhr was ordained a pastor. The German Evangelical mission board sent him to serve at Bethel Evangelical Church in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. The congregation numbered sixty-six on his arrival and grew to nearly 700 by the time he left in 1928. The increase reflected his ability to reach people outside the [[German American]] community and among the growing population attracted to jobs in the booming automobile industry. In the early 1900s Detroit became the fourth-largest city in the country, attracting many black and white migrants from the rural South, as well as Jewish and Catholic ethnics from eastern and southern Europe. They competed for jobs and limited housing, and the city's rapid changes and rise in social tensions contributed to the growth in numbers of [[Ku Klux Klan]] members in the city, which reached its peak in 1925, and to the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]]. During that year's city election campaign, in which the Klan publicly supported several candidates, including for the office of mayor, Niebuhr spoke out publicly against the Klan to his congregation,&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kenneth T. Jackson |title=The Ku Klux Klan in the City, 1915–1930 |origyear=1967 |year=1992 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing them as "one of the worst specific social phenomena which the religious pride of a people has ever developed". Only one of their several candidates gained a seat on the city council, and [[Charles Bowles]], the mayoral candidate, was defeated.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;

===World War I===
As America entered the World War in 1917, Niebuhr was the unknown pastor of a small German-speaking congregation in Detroit (it stopped using German in 1919). All [[German American]] culture in the United States and nearby Canada came under attack for suspicion of having dual loyalties. Niebuhr repeatedly stressed the need to be loyal to America, and won an audience in national magazines for his appeals to the German Americans to be patriotic.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, ''Reinhold Niebuhr'' ch 3&lt;/ref&gt; Theologically, he went beyond the issue of national loyalty as he endeavored to fashion a realistic ethical perspective of patriotism and pacifism. He endeavored to work out a realistic approach to the moral danger posed by aggressive powers, which many idealists and pacifists failed to recognize. During the war, he also served his denomination as Executive Secretary of the War Welfare Commission, while maintaining his pastorate in Detroit. A pacifist at heart, he saw compromise as a necessity and was willing to support war in order to find peace—compromising for the sake of righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;William G. Chrystal, "Reinhold Niebuhr and the First World War", ''Journal of Presbyterian History'' 1977 55(3): 285–298. 0022-3883&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins of Niebuhr's working class and labor class sympathy===
Several attempts have been made to explicate the origins of Niebuhr's sympathies from the 1920s to working class and labor class issues as documented by his biographer Richard W. Fox.&lt;ref name="Fox, Reinhold Niebuhr ch 4"&gt;Fox, ''Reinhold Niebuhr'' ch 4&lt;/ref&gt; One supportive example has concerned his interest in the plight of auto workers in Detroit. This one interest among others can be briefly summarized below.
 
After seminary, Niebuhr preached the [[Social Gospel]], and then initiated the engagement of what he considered the insecurity of Ford workers.&lt;ref&gt;See Reinhold Niebuhr, "Detroit" (radio interview [http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/niebuhr-rediscovered/b8.shtml online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809133030/http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/niebuhr-rediscovered/b8.shtml |date=August 9, 2009 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr had moved to the left and was troubled by the demoralizing effects of industrialism on workers. He became an outspoken critic of [[Henry Ford]] and allowed union organizers to use his pulpit to expound their message of workers' rights. Niebuhr attacked poor conditions created by the assembly lines and erratic employment practices.&lt;ref name="Fox, Reinhold Niebuhr ch 4-5"&gt;Fox, ''Reinhold Niebuhr'' ch 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his opinion about factory work, Niebuhr rejected liberal optimism. He wrote in his diary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We went through one of the big automobile factories to-day.... The foundry interested me particularly. The heat was terrific. The men seemed weary. Here manual labour is a drudgery and toil is slavery. The men cannot possibly find any satisfaction in their work. They simply work to make a living. Their sweat and their dull pain are part of the price paid for the fine cars we all run. And most of us run the cars without knowing what price is being paid for them.... We are all responsible. We all want the things which the factory produces and none of us is sensitive enough to care how much in human values the efficiency of the modern factory costs.&lt;ref&gt;Niebuhr, ''Leaves from the Notebook of a Tamed Cynic'' pp. 79–80)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The historian Ronald H. Stone thinks that Niebuhr never talked to the assembly line workers (many of his parishioners were skilled craftsmen) but projected feelings onto them after discussions with Rev. Samuel Marquis.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Stone, ''Professor Reinhold Niebuhr: A Mentor to the Twentieth Century'' (1992) pp 29–32&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr's criticism of Ford and capitalism resonated with progressives and helped make him nationally prominent.&lt;ref name="Fox, Reinhold Niebuhr ch 4-5"/&gt; His serious commitment to [[Marxism]] developed after he moved to New York in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, ''Professor Reinhold Niebuhr'' p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Niebuhr visited Europe to meet with intellectuals and theologians. The conditions he saw in Germany under the French [[occupation of the Rhineland]] dismayed him. They reinforced the [[pacifism|pacifist]] views that he had adopted throughout the 1920s after [[World War I]].

==1930s: Growing influence in New York==
Niebuhr captured his personal experiences in Detroit in his book ''Leaves from the Notebook of a Tamed Cynic''. He continued to write and publish throughout his career, and also served as editor of the magazine ''Christianity and Crisis'' from 1941 through 1966.

In 1928, Niebuhr left Detroit to become Professor of Practical Theology at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in New York. He spent the rest of his career there, until retirement in 1960. While teaching theology at Union Theological Seminary, Niebuhr influenced many generations of students and thinkers, including the German minister [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] of the anti-[[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Confessing Church]].

The Fellowship of Socialist Christians was organized in the early 1930s by Niebuhr and others with similar views.
Later it changed its name to Frontier Fellowship and then to Christian Action.
The main supporters of the Fellowship in the early days included [[Eduard Heimann]], [[Sherwood Eddy]], [[Paul Tillich]] and [[Rose Terlin]]. 
In its early days the group thought capitalist individualism was incompatible with Christian ethics.
Although not Communist, the group acknowledged [[Karl Marx]]'s social philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=115 |last=Stone|first=Ronald H.|title=Professor Reinhold Niebuhr: A Mentor to the Twentieth Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypy5Uz4qm5YC&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=2016-03-14 |date=1992-01-01|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25390-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Niebuhr was among the group of 51 prominent Americans who formed the International Relief Association (IRA) that is today known as the [[International Rescue Committee]] (IRC).&lt;ref&gt;Some others included philosopher [[John Dewey]] and writer [[John Dos Passos]].&lt;/ref&gt; The committee mission was to assist Germans suffering from the policies of the Hitler regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New German Relief Unit: American Branch Formed to Aid Work Headed by Einstein |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 24, 1933 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1933/07/24/105402056.pdf |page=11 |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niebuhr and Dewey===
In the 1930s Niebuhr was often seen as an intellectual opponent of [[John Dewey]]. Both men were professional polemicists and their ideas often clashed, although they contributed to the same realms of liberal intellectual schools of thought. Niebuhr was a strong proponent of the "Jerusalem" religious tradition as a corrective to the secular "Athens" tradition insisted upon by Dewey.&lt;ref&gt;Rice ''Reinhold Niebuhr and John Dewey: An American Odyssey'', (1993), page 146&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''[[Moral Man and Immoral Society]]'' (1932), Niebuhr strongly criticized Dewey's philosophy, although his own ideas were still intellectually inchoate.&lt;ref name="Rice, pages 43-58"&gt;Rice, ''Reinhold Niebuhr and John Dewey'' pages 43–58&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in a review of Dewey's book ''A Common Faith'' (1934), Niebuhr was calm and respectful towards Dewey's "religious footnote" on his then large body of educational and pragmatic philosophy.&lt;ref name="Rice, pages 43-58"/&gt;

==Neo-orthodox theology==
In 1939 Niebuhr explained his theological odyssey:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Niebuhr |first=Reinhold | title = Ten Years That Shook My World | journal = The Christian Century | date = April 26, 1939}} in {{Cite book | title = Sources of the American Mind | volume = II |editor-first=Loren | editor-last = Baritz | year = 1960 | pages = 542–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote |... About midway in my ministry which extends roughly from the peace of Versailles [1919] to the peace of Munich [1938], measured in terms of Western history, I underwent a fairly complete conversion of thought which involved rejection of almost all the liberal theological ideals and ideas with which I ventured forth in 1915. I wrote a book [''Does Civilization Need Religion?''], my first, in 1927 which ... contains almost all the theological windmills against which today I tilt my sword. These windmills must have tumbled shortly thereafter for every succeeding volume expresses a more and more explicit revolt against what is usually known as liberal culture.}}

In the 1930s Niebuhr worked out many of his ideas about sin and grace, love and justice, faith and reason, realism and idealism, and the irony and tragedy of history, which established his leadership of the [[Neo-orthodoxy|neo-orthodox]] movement in theology. Influenced strongly by [[Karl Barth]] and other dialectical theologians of Europe, he began to emphasize the Bible as a human record of divine self-revelation; it offered for Niebuhr a critical but redemptive reorientation of the understanding of humanity's nature and destiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Fox | title = Reinhold Niebuhr | chapter = 7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niebuhr couched his ideas in Christ-centered principles such as the [[Great Commandment]] and the doctrine of original sin. His major contribution was his view of sin as a social event—as pride—with selfish self-centeredness as the root of evil. The sin of pride was apparent not just in criminals, but more dangerously in people who felt good about their deeds—rather like Henry Ford (whom he did not mention by name). The human tendency to corrupt the good was the great insight he saw manifested in governments, business, democracies, utopian societies, and churches. This position is laid out profoundly in one of his most influential books, ''Moral Man and Immoral Society'' (1932). He was a debunker of hypocrisy and pretense and made the avoidance of self-righteous illusions the center of his thoughts.&lt;ref name="Hussain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorrien" /&gt;

Niebuhr argued that to approach religion as the individualistic attempt to fulfill biblical commandments in a moralistic sense is not only an impossibility but also a demonstration of man's original sin, which Niebuhr interpreted as self-love. Through self-love man becomes focused on his own goodness and leaps to the false conclusion—one he called the "[[Prometheus|Promethean]] illusion"—that he can achieve goodness on his own. Thus man mistakes his partial ability to transcend himself for the ability to prove his absolute authority over his own life and world. Constantly frustrated by natural limitations, man develops a lust for power which destroys him and his whole world. History is the record of these crises and judgments which man brings on himself; it is also proof that God does not allow man to overstep his possibilities. In radical contrast to the Promethean illusion, God reveals himself in history, especially personified in Jesus Christ, as sacrificial love which overcomes the human temptation to self-deification and makes possible constructive human history.&lt;ref name="Hussain"&gt;Khurram Hussain, "Tragedy and History in Reinhold Niebuhr's Thought", ''American Journal of Theology and Philosophy'', Volume 31, Number 2, May 2010, pp. 147–159 {{doi|10.1353/ajt.0.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorrien"&gt;Gary Dorrien, ''The Making of American Liberal Theology: Idealism, Realism, and Modernity 1900–1950'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

===Domestic===
During the 1930s, Niebuhr was a prominent leader of the militant faction of the [[Socialist Party of America]], although he disliked die-hard Marxists. He described their beliefs as a religion and a thin one at that.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, ''Niebuhr'' 169–70.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, he co-founded the [[Union for Democratic Action]], a group with a strongly [[Interventionism (politics)|militarily interventionist]], [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] foreign policy and a pro-[[trade union|union]], [[Liberalism|liberal]] domestic policy. He was the group's president until it transformed into the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Niebuhr and His Age: Reinhold Niebuhr's Prophetic Role and Legacy'', 2002, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
Within the framework of [[Christian realism]], Niebuhr became a supporter of American action in [[World War II]], [[anti-communism]], and the development of [[nuclear weapons]]. However, he [[opposed the Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Matthew Berke |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/03/004-the-disputed-legacy-of-reinhold-niebuhr-22 |title=The Disputed Legacy of Reinhold Niebuhr |work=First Things |date=November 1992 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610013648/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/03/004-the-disputed-legacy-of-reinhold-niebuhr-22 |archivedate=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Thompson, "An Exception to Exceptionalism: A Reflection on Reinhold Niebuhr's Vision of 'Prophetic' Christianity and the Problem of Religion and U.S. Foreign Policy", ''[[American Quarterly]]'', Volume 59, Number 3, September 2007, pp. 833–855 {{doi|10.1353/aq.2007.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], the pacifist component of his liberalism was challenged. Niebuhr began to distance himself from the pacifism of his more liberal colleagues and became a staunch advocate for the war. Niebuhr soon left the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]], a peace-oriented group of theologians and ministers, and became one of their harshest critics.

This departure from his peers evolved into a movement known as Christian realism. Niebuhr is widely considered to have been its primary advocate.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Meyer, ''The Protestant Search for Political Realism, 1919–1941''(1988), ch 13&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr supported the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during World War II and argued for the engagement of the United States in the war. As a writer popular in both the secular and the religious arena and a professor at the Union Theological Seminary, he was very influential both in the United States and abroad. While many clergy proclaimed themselves pacifists because of their World War&amp;nbsp;I experiences, Niebuhr declared that a victory by Germany and Japan would threaten Christianity. He renounced his socialist connections and beliefs and resigned from the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation. He based his arguments on the Protestant beliefs that sin is part of the world, that justice must take precedence over love, and that pacifism is a symbolic portrayal of absolute love but cannot prevent sin. Although his opponents did not portray him favorably, Niebuhr's exchanges with them on the issue helped him mature intellectually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Doenecke | first1 = Justus D. | authorlink = Justus Drew Doenecke| year = 1995 | title = Reinhold Niebuhr and his Critics: The Interventionist Controversy in World War II | url = | journal = Anglican and Episcopal History | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 459–481 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niebuhr debated [[Charles Clayton Morrison]], editor of ''[[The Christian Century]]'' magazine, about America's entry into World War II. Morrison and his pacifistic followers maintained that America's role should be strictly neutral and part of a negotiated peace only, while Niebuhr claimed himself to be a realist, who opposed the use of political power to attain moral ends. Morrison and his followers strongly supported the movement to outlaw war that began after [[World War I]] and the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] of 1928. The pact was severely challenged by the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931. With his publication of ''Moral Man and Immoral Society'' (1932), Niebuhr broke ranks with ''The Christian Century'' and supported interventionism and power politics. He supported the reelection of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] [[United States presidential election, 1940|in 1940]] and published his own magazine, ''Christianity and Crisis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bullert | first1 = Gary B. | year = 2002 | title = Reinhold Niebuhr and the Christian Century: World War&amp;nbsp;II and the Eclipse of the Social Gospel | url = | journal = [[Journal of Church and State]] | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 271–290 | doi=10.1093/jcs/44.2.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, however, Niebuhr charged that use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima was "morally indefensible".

[[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]]&lt;ref name="Arthur" /&gt; explained Niebuhr's influence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Traditionally, the idea of the frailty of man led to the demand for obedience to ordained authority. But Niebuhr rejected that ancient conservative argument. Ordained authority, he showed, is all the more subject to the temptations of self-interest, self-deception and self-righteousness. Power must be balanced by power. He persuaded me and many of my contemporaries that original sin provides a far stronger foundation for freedom and self-government than illusions about human perfectibility. Niebuhr's analysis was grounded in the Christianity of Augustine and Calvin, but he had, nonetheless, a special affinity with secular circles. His warnings against utopianism, messianism and perfectionism strike a chord today.... We cannot play the role of God to history, and we must strive as best we can to attain decency, clarity and proximate justice in an ambiguous world.&lt;ref name="Arthur"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Niebuhr's defense of Roosevelt made him popular among liberals, as the historian [[Morton White]] noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The contemporary liberal's fascination with Niebuhr, I suggest, comes less from Niebuhr's dark theory of human nature and more from his actual political pronouncements, from the fact that he is a shrewd, courageous, and right-minded man on many political questions. Those who applaud his politics are too liable to turn then to his theory of human nature and praise it as the philosophical instrument of Niebuhr's political agreement with themselves. But very few of those whom I have called "atheists for Niebuhr" follow this inverted logic to its conclusion: they don't move from praise of Niebuhr's theory of human nature to praise of its theological ground. We may admire them for drawing the line somewhere, but certainly not for their consistency.&lt;ref&gt;[[Morton White]], ''Religion, Politics, and the Higher Learning'', (1959) pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After [[Joseph Stalin]] signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with [[Adolf Hitler]] in August 1939, Niebuhr severed his past ties with any [[fellow-traveler]] organization having any known Communist leanings. In 1947, Niebuhr helped found the liberal [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA). His ideas influenced [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], and other realists during the [[Cold War]] on the need to [[contain Communist expansion]].

In his last cover story for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (March 1948), [[Whittaker Chambers]] said of Niebuhr:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most U.S. liberals think of Niebuhr as a solid socialist who has some obscure connection with Union Theological Seminary that does not interfere with his political work. Unlike most clergymen in politics, Dr. Niebuhr is a pragmatist. Says James Loeb, secretary of Americans for Democratic Action: "Most so-called liberals are idealists. They let their hearts run away with their heads. Niebuhr never does. For example, he has always been the leading liberal opponent of pacifism. In that period before we got into the war when pacifism was popular, he held out against it steadfastly. He is also an opponent of Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853293,00.html|work=Time|title=Religion: Faith for a Lenten Age|date=March 8, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1950s, Niebuhr described Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] as a force of evil, not so much for attacking civil liberties, as for being ineffective in rooting out Communists and their sympathizers.&lt;ref name="Fox, 1985 p 252"&gt;Fox, ''Reinhold Niebuhr'' (1985) p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, he supported the execution of the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Rosenbergs]], saying, "Traitors are never ordinary criminals and the Rosenbergs are quite obviously fiercely loyal Communists... Stealing atomic secrets is an unprecedented crime."&lt;ref name="Fox, 1985 p 252"/&gt;

==Views on race, ethnicity and other religious affiliations==
His views developed during his pastoral tenure in Detroit, which had become a place of immigration, migration, competition and development as a major industrial city. During the 1920s, Niebuhr spoke out against the rise of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in Detroit, which had recruited many members threatened by the rapid social changes. The Klan proposed positions that were anti-black, anti-Jewish and anti-Catholic. Niebuhr's preaching against the Klan, especially in relation to the 1925 mayoral election, gained him national attention.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (1992), ''The Ku Klux Klan in the City''&lt;/ref&gt;

Niebuhr's thoughts on racial justice developed slowly after he abandoned socialism. Niebuhr attributed the injustices of society to human pride and self-love and believed that this innate propensity for evil could not be controlled by humanity. But, he believed that a representative democracy could improve society's ills. Like [[Edmund Burke]], Niebuhr endorsed natural evolution over imposed change and emphasized experience over theory. Niebuhr's Burkean ideology, however, often conflicted with his liberal principles, particularly regarding his perspective on racial justice. Though vehemently opposed to racial inequality, Niebuhr adopted a conservative position on [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

While after World War&amp;nbsp;II most liberals endorsed integration, Niebuhr focused on achieving equal opportunity. He warned against imposing changes that could result in violence. The violence that followed peaceful demonstrations in the 1960s forced Niebuhr to reverse his position against imposed equality; witnessing the problems of the Northern [[ghettos]] later caused him to doubt that equality was attainable.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = Greg | year = 2000 | title = Reinhold Niebuhr: The Racial Liberal as Burkean | url = | journal = Prospects | volume = 25 | issue = 641–661| pages = 0361–2333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholicism===
[[Anti-Catholicism]] surged in Detroit in the 1920s in reaction to the rise in the number of Catholic immigrants from southern Europe since the early 20th century. It was exacerbated by the revival of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], which recruited many members in Detroit. Niebuhr defended pluralism by attacking the Klan. During the Detroit mayoral election of 1925, Niebuhr's sermon, "We fair-minded [[Protestants]] cannot deny", was published on the front pages of both the ''Detroit Times'' and the ''Free Press''.

This sermon urged people to vote against mayoral candidate [[Charles Bowles]], who was being openly endorsed by the Klan. The Catholic incumbent, [[John W. Smith (Detroit mayor)|John W. Smith]], won by a narrow 30,000 votes. Niebuhr preached against the Klan and helped to influence its decline in political power in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth T. Jackson, ''The Ku Klux Klan in the City'', 1915–1930'' (1992), pp. 129, 134&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr preached:
{{quote|that it was Protestantism that gave birth to the Ku Klux Klan, one of the worst specific social phenomena which the religious pride and prejudice of peoples has ever developed.... I do not deny that all religions are periodically corrupted by bigotry. But I hit Protestant bigotry the hardest at this time because it happens to be our sin and there is no use repenting for other people's sins. Let us repent of our own.... We are admonished in Scripture to judge men by their fruits, not by their roots; and their fruits are their character, their deeds and accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, ''Reinhold Niebuhr" (1985) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Martin Luther King Jr.===
In the "[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]" [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] wrote, "Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals." King drew more heavily upon Niebuhr's social and ethical ideals than on anyone else (including Gandhi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jessica McElrath|title=The Everything Martin Luther King, Jr. Book: The Struggle, The Tragedy, The Dream|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tvl-4Vr-ag4C&amp;pg=PA48|year=2007|publisher=Everything Books|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  King invited Niebuhr to participate in the third [[Selma to Montgomery March]] in 1965, and Niebuhr responded by telegram: "Only a severe stroke prevents me from accepting ... I hope there will be a massive demonstration of all the citizens with conscience in favor of the elemental human rights of voting and freedom of assembly" (Niebuhr, March 19, 1965). Two years later, Niebuhr defended King's decision to speak out against the [[Vietnam War]], calling him "one of the greatest religious leaders of our time". Niebuhr asserted: "Dr. King has the right and a duty, as both a religious and a civil rights leader, to express his concern in these days about such a major human problem as the Vietnam War."&lt;ref&gt;Ansbro, 261&lt;/ref&gt; Of his country's intervention in Vietnam, Niebuhr admitted: "For the first time I fear I am ashamed of our beloved nation."&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 285&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
As a young pastor in Detroit, he favored conversion of Jews to Christianity, scolding evangelical Christians who were [[anti-Semitic]] or ignoring them. He spoke out against "the unchristlike attitude of Christians", and what he described as his fellow Christians' "Jewish bigotry".&lt;ref name="Fox, Reinhold Niebuhr 1985"&gt;Fox, ''Reinhold Niebuhr" (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; His 1933 article in the ''[[Christian Century]]'' was an attempt to sound the alarm within the Christian community over Hitler's "cultural annihilation of the Jews".&lt;ref name="Fox, Reinhold Niebuhr 1985"/&gt; Eventually, his theology evolved to the point where he was the first prominent Christian theologian to argue it was inappropriate for Christians to seek to convert Jews to their faith.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote several articles regarding the pre- and post-World War II plight of European Jews: "Jews After the War" (in 2 parts ''Nation'', February 21 and February 28, 1942, pages 214–216 and 253–255), "It Might Have Been" (''Evangelical Herald'', March 29, 1923, page 202), "The Rapprochement Between Jews and Christians" (''Christian Century'', January 7, 1926, pages 9–11), "Germany Must Be Told" (''Christian Century'', August 9, 1933, pages 1014–1015, follow-up ''Letter to the Editor'' to this article, same journal, May 27, 1936, p. 771).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a preacher, writer, leader, and adviser to political figures, Niebuhr supported [[Zionism]] and the development of [[Israel]]. His solution to anti-Semitism was a combination of a Jewish homeland, greater tolerance, and assimilation in other countries. As early as 1942, he advocated the expulsion of Arabs from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and their resettlement in other Arab countries. His position may have related to his religious conviction that life on earth is imperfect, and his concern about German anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;Eyal Naveh, "Unconventional 'Christian Zionist': The Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and his Attitude toward the Jewish National Movement". ''Studies in Zionism'' 1990 11(2): 183–196; 1991 12(1): 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1952, Niebuhr published ''The Irony of American History'', in which he interpreted the meaning of the United States' past. Niebuhr questioned whether a humane, "ironical" interpretation of American history was credible on its own merits, or only in the context of a Christian view of history. Niebuhr's concept of irony referred to situations in which "the consequences of an act are diametrically opposed to the original intention", and "the fundamental cause of the disparity lies in the actor himself, and his original purpose." His reading of American history based on this notion, though from the Christian perspective, is so rooted in historical events that readers who do not share his religious views can be led to the same conclusion. Niebuhr's great foe was idealism. American idealism, he believed, comes in two forms: the idealism of the antiwar non-interventionists, who are embarrassed by power; and the idealism of pro-war imperialists, who disguise power as virtue. He said the non-interventionists, without mentioning [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]] by name, seek to preserve the purity of their souls, either by denouncing military actions or by demanding that every action taken be unequivocally virtuous. They exaggerate the sins committed by their own country, excuse the malevolence of its enemies and, as later polemicists have put it, inevitably blame America first. Niebuhr argued this approach was a pious way to refuse to face real problems.&lt;ref&gt;Martin E. Marty, "Reinhold Niebuhr and the Irony of American History: A Retrospective", ''History Teacher'' 1993 26(2): 161–174. 0018-2745&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serenity Prayer==
{{main article|Serenity Prayer}}
Niebuhr claimed he wrote the short ''Serenity Prayer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aahistory.com/prayer.html |title=The Origin of our Serenity Prayer |accessdate=2007-10-09}}; {{cite news |last=Goodstein |first=Laurie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/world/americas/11iht-prayer.4.14439421.html |title=Serenity Prayer faces challenge on authorship |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 11, 2008 |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred R. Shapiro]], who had cast doubts on Niebuhr's claim, conceded in 2009 that, "The new evidence does not prove that Reinhold Niebuhr wrote [the prayer], but it does significantly improve the likelihood that he was the originator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/28/us/28prayer.html |author=Laurie Goodstein |title=Serenity Prayer Skeptic Now Credits Niebuhr |newspaper=The New York Times  |date=November 27, 2009 |page=A11 |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known version of the prayer, from 1937, attributes the prayer to Niebuhr in this version:

"Father, give us courage to change what must be altered, serenity to accept what cannot be helped, and the insight to know the one from the other."

The most popular version, the authorship of which is unknown, reads:

:God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
:Courage to change the things I can,
:And the wisdom to know the difference.

==Influence==
Many political scientists, such as [[George F. Kennan]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], [[Kenneth Waltz]], and [[Samuel P. Huntington]] and [[political history|political historians]], such as [[Richard Hofstadter]], [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], and [[Christopher Lasch]], have noted his influence on their thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-intl-relations/ |title=Political Realism in International Relations |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=April 2, 2013 |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://philica.com/display_article.php?article_id=335 |last=Kamminga |first=Menno R. |title=Structure and Sin: The Niebuhrian Roots of Waltz's Neorealist Theory of International Politics |issn=1751-3030 |journal=Philica.com |date=9 July 2012 |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote box |width=30em | bgcolor=#ACE1AF |align=right|quote=The tragedy of man is that he can conceive self perfection but cannot achieve it.|salign=right |source=—Reinhold Niebuhr&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt; }}
Niebuhr exerted a significant influence upon [[mainline Protestant]] clergy in the years immediately following World War II, much of it in concord with the [[neo-orthodox]] and the related movements. That influence began to wane and then drop toward the end of his life.

The historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] in the late twentieth century described the legacy of Niebuhr as being contested between American liberals and conservatives, both of whom wanted to claim him.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Berke, [http://www.firstthings.com/article.php3?id_article=6188 "The Disputed Legacy of Reinhold Niebuhr"], ''First Things'' (November 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] gave credit to Niebuhr's influence. Foreign-policy conservatives point to Niebuhr's support of the [[containment]] doctrine during the [[Cold War]] as an instance of moral realism; progressives cite his later opposition to the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;Berke, "The Disputed Legacy of Reinhold Niebuhr", ''First Things'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, Niebuhr has enjoyed something of a renaissance in contemporary thought, although usually not in liberal Protestant theological circles. Both major-party candidates in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]] cited Niebuhr as an influence: Senator [[John McCain]], in his book ''[[Hard Call]]'', "celebrated Niebuhr as a paragon of clarity about the costs of a good war".&lt;ref&gt;Elie, Paul. "A Man for All Reasons", ''[[The Atlantic]]'', November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] said that Niebuhr was his "favorite philosopher"&lt;ref&gt;Paul Allen, [https://www.thestar.com/News/USElection/article/443383 "The Obama Niebuhr connection"], ''The Toronto Star'' (June 14, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and "favorite theologian".&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1268/reinhold-neihbuhr-obama-favorite-theologian "Obama's Favorite Theologian? A Short Course on Reinhold Niebuhr"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702140104/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1268/reinhold-neihbuhr-obama-favorite-theologian |date=July 2, 2009 }}, "Pew Research" (June 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine columnist [[Fred Kaplan (journalist)|Fred Kaplan]] characterized Obama's 2009 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] acceptance speech a "faithful reflection" of Niebuhr.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2238081/|title= Obama's War and Peace|author=Fred Kaplan|publisher=Slate| date=10 December 2009|accessdate=March 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Waltz]]'s seminal work on international relations theory, ''[[Man, the State, and War]]'', includes many references to Niebuhr's thought. Waltz emphasizes Niebuhr's contributions to [[political realism]], especially "the impossibility of human perfection".&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Waltz, ''Man, the State, and War'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Bacevich]]'s book ''The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism'' refers to Niebuhr 13 times.&lt;ref&gt;Bacevich Andrew, ''The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism p. 202 (index Niebuhr) ''&lt;/ref&gt; Bacevich emphasises Niebuhr's humility and his belief that Americans were in danger of becoming enamored of U.S.&amp;nbsp;power.

Other leaders of American foreign policy in the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century have acknowledged Niebuhr's importance to them, including [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Madeleine Albright]], and [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank A. Ruechel, "Politics And Morality Revisited: Jimmy Carter and Reinhold Niebuhr", ''Atlanta History'' 1994 37(4): 19–31; John McCain, ''Hard Call: Great Decisions and the Extraordinary People Who Made Them?'' (2007) pp. 321–38; also [http://pewforum.org/news/display.php?NewsID=14256 "Reinhold Niebuhr Is Unseen Force in 2008 Elections"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229175731/http://pewforum.org/news/display.php?NewsID=14256 |date=December 29, 2009 }}, September 27, 2007, Benedicta Cipolla, ''Religion News Service'' of the ''Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
* During his lifetime, Niebuhr was awarded several honorary doctorates.
* In 1964, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] awarded Niebuhr the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].
* In Niebuhr's honor, New York City named West 120th Street between [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] Reinhold Niebuhr Place.&lt;ref name="Kegley2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGBMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|title=Reinhold Niebuhr: His Religious, Social, and Political Thought|last=Kegley|first=Charles W.|date=2009|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-60899-128-0|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the site of [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in Manhattan, where Niebuhr taught for more than 30 years.&lt;ref name="Brown2002"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gABsAxlOsoEC&amp;pg=PA246|title=Niebuhr and His Age: Reinhold Niebuhr's Prophetic Role and Legacy|last=Brown|first=Charles C.|date=2002|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-56338-375-5|pages=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Elmhurst College, his ''alma mater'', established the Niebuhr Medal to honor him and his brother.&lt;ref name="Elmurst"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090704123905/http://public.elmhurst.edu/collections/niebuhrlegacy "The Niebuhr Legacy"], Elmhurst College&lt;/ref&gt;

Niebuhr's influence was at its peak during the first two decades of the Cold War. By the 1970s, his influence was declining because of the rise of liberation theology, antiwar sentiment, the growth of conservative evangelicalism, and postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://religionandpolitics.org/2017/04/25/reinhold-niebuhr-washingtons-favorite-theologian/ "Reinhold Niebuhr, Washington’s Favorite Theologian"] by Gene Zubovich, "Religion &amp; Politics", April 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Gene Zubovich, "It took the tragic events of September 11, 2001, to revive Niebuhr."&lt;ref&gt;[http://religionandpolitics.org/2017/04/25/reinhold-niebuhr-washingtons-favorite-theologian/ "Reinhold Niebuhr, Washington’s Favorite Theologian"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring of 2017, it was speculated&lt;ref name="Acts of Faith"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boorstein|first1=Michelle|title=Why did James Comey name his secret Twitter account ‘Reinhold Niebuhr’? Here’s what we know.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/10/23/why-did-james-comey-name-his-secret-twitter-account-reinhold-niebuhr-heres-what-we-know/|website=Washington Post Online|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and later confirmed&lt;ref name="Who is James Comey?"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vazquez|first1=Maegen|title=Case cracked: Comey reveals secret Twitter account|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/23/politics/james-comey-twitter-account/index.html|website=CNN Politics|publisher=CNN|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that former FBI director [[James Comey]] used Niebuhr's name as a screen name for his personal [[Twitter]] account. Comey, as a religion major at the [[College of William &amp; Mary]], wrote his undergraduate thesis on Niebuhr and televangelist [[Jerry Falwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cain|first1=Áine|title=FBI Director James Comey Reflects On His Time At The College|url=http://flathatnews.com/2014/11/17/fbi-director-james-comey-reflects-on-his-time-at-the-college/|website=Flat Hat News|publisher=The Flat Hat|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal style==
Niebuhr was often described as a charismatic speaker. The journalist [[Alden Whitman]] wrote of his speaking style:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He possessed a deep voice and large blue eyes. He used his arms as though he were an orchestra conductor. Occasionally one hand would strike out, with a pointed finger at the end, to accent a trenchant sentence. He talked rapidly and (because he disliked to wear spectacles for his far-sightedness) without notes; yet he was adroit at building logical climaxes and in communicating a sense of passionate involvement in what he was saying.&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7025">'''Walther Poppelreuter''' (also incorrectly written in the literature ''Walther Poppelreuther'' and ''Walter Poppelreuter''; born October 8, 1886 in [[Saarbrücken]]; died June 11, 1939 in [[Bonn]]&lt;ref name="Poppelreuter1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walther Poppelreuter|title=Disturbances of lower and higher visual capacities caused by occipital damage: with special reference to the psychopathological, pedagogical, industrial, and social implications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9H1sAAAAMAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-852190-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a German [[psychologist]] and [[neurologist]]. He dealt mainly with [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injuries]] of soldiers during the [[First World War]] and developed [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] examination procedures that were used in the treatment of brain-injured patients and in industrial [[aptitude test]]s. He was among the first high school teachers who advocated openly for [[Nazism]] before the "seizure of power" ([[Machtergreifung]]). His psychometric tests are often used in visual [[neuropsychology]], especially the Poppelreuter figure visual perceptual function test.&lt;ref name="Poppelreuter1990" /&gt;

==Biography==
The son of a high school director, Poppelreuter studied philosophy with a special emphasis on [[experimental psychology]] in [[Berlin]] and received his [[doctorate]] in 1908 in [[Königsberg]]. He then studied medicine and graduated in 1914.&lt;ref name="L1"&gt;Georg Lamberti: ''Die Psychotechnik in den zwanziger Jahren des 20. Jahrhunderts.'' In: Georg Lamberti (Hrsg.): ''Intelligenz auf dem Prüfstand: 100 Jahre Psychometrie.'' Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, Göttingen 2006, {{ISBN|3-525-46241-7}}, S. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; He came on as assistant to [[Gustav Aschaffenburg]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of Cologne, which during the First World War was the Cologne fortress hospital for head injuries.&lt;ref name="Wilson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara A. Wilson|title=Neuropsychological Rehabilitation: Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qlmgTN94BngC&amp;pg=PA13|date=23 September 2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-97101-7|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Poppelreuter moved to Bonn and became head of the newly founded "Institute for Applied Psychology"&lt;ref name="Geuter2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ulfried Geuter|title=The Professionalization of Psychology in Nazi Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teV-sPFbetQC&amp;pg=PA127|date=18 December 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-10213-1|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; - trade station for German brain-injured war victims. In 1922, he received a position at the [[University of Bonn]] as an associate professor of clinical psychology. Poppelreuter's work on brain injury gave him high professional recognition. He developed a series of psychometric examination methods that were used in industrial psychology and vocational counseling. His clinical interest was given to the possible treatment of neuropsychological dysfunction.

Against his resistance Poppelreuter's "Brain-Injured Institute" moved in 1925 to [[Düsseldorf]]; however, it had been vacant since 1924. Poppelreuter had given himself a sabbatical in 1923/24 and turned to ergonomic issues at Gelsenkirchen mine association. In 1925, he became head of the Institute of Work Psychology at RWTH Aachen University and founded in 1928 on Adolf Wallichs guided Chair for teaching a laboratory for industrial psycho-technique. Here he continued the experience he had gained from the inclusion of war-disabled in the rationalization of work processes in order.

In the winter semester 1931/32 he held a series of lectures on [[political psychology]] as applied psychology on the basis of Hitler's book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', which he in 1934 under the title Hitler, the political psychologist published. Hitler had told him in July 1932 in writing his joy that the first time his book will issue a lecture at a university.

In the Nazi period, Poppelreuter operated as a consultant of the National Socialist German Institute for Technical Work Research and Training in Düsseldorf. In Bonn, he served as Deputy Chairman of Psychology at the German Society. Shortly before his death, occupational and partisan judicial proceedings had been initiated against him for [[Alcohol use disorder|alcohol abuse]] and reprehensible means in a divorce dispute.

==Contributions to psychology==

===Poppelreuter's law===
Poppelreuter's Law is a law of [[physiology|physiological training]] that states that when teaching a skill requiring both speed and accuracy, it is better in the early stages to limit speed and practice until a certain degree of accuracy has been attained, and then gradually increase the speed.&lt;ref&gt;Hellebrandt, F. A. (1972). The physiology of motor learning. In R. N. Singer (Ed.), Readings in motor learning (pp. 397-409). Philadelphia, PA: Lea &amp; Febiger.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was invented and so named by Walther Poppelreuter in 1922. Subsequent research has invalidated the law, indicating that the neuromuscular patterns between the same activity performed slow and fast oftentimes are completely different and therefore unable to be trained simultaneously.

===Poppelreuter figure visual perceptual function test===
[[File:Poppelreuter probe.jpg|thumb|Poppelreuter overlapping figure]]
Poppelreuter invented the overlapping figures test in 1917 as one method of assessing brain injury incurred during World War I.&lt;ref name="Lezak2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Muriel Deutsch Lezak|title=Neuropsychological Assessment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FroDVkVKA2EC&amp;pg=PA403|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-511121-7|pages=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typical for people with [[apperceptive agnosia]] to have difficulty with the overlapping figures, but not for people with associative visual agnosia.&lt;ref name="Larner2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.J. Larner|title=Dementia in Clinical Practice: A Neurological Perspective: Studies in the Dementia Clinic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZS049u1S-yQC&amp;pg=PA48|date=10 January 2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4471-2361-3|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and criticism==
The Walther-Poppelreuter Medal was named in his honor. In addition, houses and streets were named after him. Poppelreuter's Nazi past was only noticed by the publication of a book on child euthanasia in the Bonn children's institution in the public consciousness. In 1990, [[Hannelore Kohl]] returned the Poppelreuter medal conferred in 1986. 

In the district of Cologne Ostheim, there was a Poppelreuter Street since 1957. Due to Poppelreuter's involvement in Nazism, the road was renamed Josef-Poppelreuter Street, after the first director of the Roman division of the [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]].

'''Yevgeny Fyodorovich Dragunov''' ({{lang-ru|Евге́ний Фёдорович Драгуно́в}}; February 20, 1920{{spaced ndash}}August 4, 1991) was a Soviet [[weapons]] designer, best known his role in helping invent the [[semi-automatic rifle]] bearing his name, the [[Dragunov sniper rifle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =The Gun |first= C. J.|last= Chivers |page=16|publisher =Simon and Schuster|location=New York| year=2011 |ISBN = 978-0-7432-7173-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
From a family of gunsmiths, Dragunov worked as a factory machinist before beginning military service in 1939.

==Career==
After 1941, Dragunov was a senior armourer, working on Soviet and also captured enemy weapons during wartime. After 1945 he returned to Izhevsk and joined the Arms Design Bureau, working as a project engineer on sporting and civilian target rifles through the 1950s. One of these, the Biathlon target rifle, went on to the Olympic Gold. In 1959 Dragunov submitted his design for a military sniping rifle, the SVD, which was accepted into Soviet military service in 1963, and later became known as the Dragunov rifle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shilin|first= Valery N. |title=Dragunov  The Man Behind the Rifle|journal= Soldier of Fortune magazine|location=Boulder, Colorado|issue=12|volume=26|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dragunov also participated in the competition that led to the adoption of [[AKS-74U]] with a gas-operated design called MA (malokalibrenii avtomat). Although Dragunov's avtomat was comparable in performance to Kalashnikov's, the latter had the advantage that it shared some parts with the [[AK-74]] rifle already in production. The non-metallic parts of the MA were made of [[polyamide]]s. The MA was Dragunov's last major design. The trigger mechanism used in the MA was fairly similar to the one previously used in the [[PP-71]] sub-machine gun,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/c1d/26_30.pdf МА - малокалиберный автомат]" ''КАЛАШНИКОВ.

==Legacy==
Dragunov was awarded the [[Lenin Prize]] and the [[State Prize of the Russian Federation]], the latter one posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;Юрий Пономарёв, [http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/9f9/80_83.pdf СВД постскриптум], Kalashnikov magazine, 2005/3, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;
