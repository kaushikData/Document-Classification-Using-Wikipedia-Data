== History ==
505 Montgomery was developed by the Empire Group of San Francisco.

The design was revised to a 24-story building based on floor area ratio calculations, and the final conditional use authorization was granted in June 1984.&lt;ref name=LSB98 /&gt; During construction, [[Mitsui Fudosan]] acquired a controlling interest in the unfinished building from The Empire Group and development was completed under the management of [[Prologis|AMB]].&lt;ref name=Prologis30 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/1999/01/18/story2.html?page=all |title=Tower selling for $95M |author=Robson, Douglas |date=17 January 1999 |newspaper=San Francisco Business Journal |accessdate=9 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrofitting projects, including a 1994 lighting retrofit, earned the building an Energy Star label.&lt;ref name=EStar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=%20labeled_buildings.showProfile&amp;profile_id=1003828 |title=ENERGY STAR Labeled Building Profile, 505 Montgomery |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=EnergyStar.gov |accessdate=9 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; National Office Partners (NOP), a partnership between [[Hines Interests Limited Partnership|Hines Interests LP]] and [[CalPERS]], acquired 505 Montgomery from Mitsui Fudosan and The Empire Group in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://newhines.myhines.com/press/releases/01-28-99.aspx |title=National Office Partners Acquires 505 Montgomery in Downtown San Francisco |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=28 January 1999 |publisher=Hines |accessdate=9 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was subsequently sold by NOP to [[RREEF]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=National Office Partners Limited Partnership Sells 12 Assets  | url=http://www.hines.com/press/releases/02-02-05.aspx | publisher=Hines Interests Limited Partnership | date=2 February 2005 | accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grabhorn Park (now Empire Park) is located in the 600 block of Commercial Street, and was provided by the developers of 505 Montgomery as a [[privately owned public space]].&lt;ref name=LSB98&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zySP4CRz2k4C&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Urban Design Downtown: Poetics and Politics of Form |author1=Loukaitou-Sideris, Anastasia |author2=Banerjee, Tridib |date=1998 |isbn=0-520-20930-3 |pages=115–118 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/empire-park.html |title=Empire Park |date=11 March 2013 |accessdate=9 March 2016 |website=Art and Architecture SF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial building design included a pedestrian arcade at the site of 505 Montgomery connecting Sacramento and Commercial streets. However, the arcade would have been rather small, expensive, shaded, and the commercial atmosphere was thought to be unwelcoming for the neighboring community of Chinatown. Therefore, the public open space was moved to a nearby property in 1988, which also freed up additional leasable floor space in 505 Montgomery.&lt;ref name=LSB98 /&gt;

'''A&amp;E Television Networks, LLC''', doing business as '''A+E Networks''', is an American broadcasting company that is a joint venture between [[Hearst Communications]] and [[Disney–ABC Television Group]], a unit of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. The company owns several non-fiction and entertainment-based television brands, including its namesake [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]], [[History (U.S. TV network)|History]], [[Lifetime (TV channel)|Lifetime]], [[FYI (U.S. TV network)|FYI]], and their associated sister channels, and holds stakes in or licenses their international branches.

== History ==

=== Arts and Entertainment ===
[[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] was formed from the merger of the [[Alpha Repertory Television Service]] and the Entertainment Channel, a premium cable channel, in 1984 with their respective owners keeping stakes in the new company. Thus A&amp;E's shareholders were [[Hearst Communications|Hearst]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (from ARTS) and [[Radio City Music Hall]] ([[Rockefeller Group]]) and [[RCA]], then the parent of [[NBC]] (from Entertainment Channel). The company launched [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|Arts &amp; Entertainment Network]], a cultural cable channel, on February 1, 1984.&lt;ref name=idc&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/a-e-television-networks-history/ A &amp; E Television Networks History]. International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 32. St. James Press, 2000. Hosted on Funding Universe.com. Retrieved on December 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vty1&gt;Dempsey, John. (June 16, 1993)  [https://variety.com/1993/tv/news/abc-nbc-hearst-buy-up-rest-of-a-e-107845/# ABC, NBC &amp; Hearst buy up rest of A&amp;E]. Variety. Accessed on December 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, after having aired episodes of its original 1960's version, A&amp;E acquired rights to, and started producing new episodes of the documentary series ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]''—which became the channel's flagship program. The network also introduced its own companion magazine, ''A&amp;E Monthly''.&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;

The company indicated that plans for a history channel were in the works in 1993; it purchased the Lou Reda Productions documentary library and long-term rights for the Hearst Entertainment documentaries archive.&lt;ref name=idc/&gt; In June 1993, the Rockefeller Group's Radio City Music Hall sold its 12.5% stake in A&amp;E to the other three partners (now including [[NBC]] in place of RCA after GE's purchase of the latter in 1986) with NBC owning 25% and the other two 37.5% each.&lt;ref name=vty1/&gt;  Also that month, a new production unit was set up.&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;

=== A&amp;E Networks ===
[[File:A&amp;E Networks.svg|200px|thumb|left|Original logo used from 2011 to 2017]]
The A&amp;E channel expanded to Canada, and later Mexico from 1993 to 1994. ''Biography'' began airing 5 nights a week in 1994. Also in 1994, A&amp;E, on its 10th anniversary, changed its name from Arts and Entertainment to A&amp;E.&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;

The A&amp;E company launched [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] on January 1, 1995, with its UK counterpart following on November 1 in partnership with [[British Sky Broadcasting]]. A&amp;E Networks considered History to be the driver in international expansion due to lack of international rights to A&amp;E international co-productions. As expected, the History Channel led A&amp;E's overseas expansion in Brazil with TVA (April 1996), the Nordic and Baltic regions with Modern Times Group (1997) and in Canada (1997).&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;

Formerly only direct sales, A&amp;E Home Video initiated a six-month trial in which [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] would sell the "Biography" line in stores and becoming permanent in 1996. THC debuted  in two other media in September 1996 with a radio program on [[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC Radio Networks]] and [[Border Books]] stocking THC videos.&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;

The 'Biography' franchise continued to expand with a website in July 1996, a children's version launched in fall 1996, an audio tape line in 1997, telefilm development, a [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown]] published short biography line and debuted its magazine which replaced A&amp;E Monthly. During the 1998-1999 season, ''Biography: American Justice'' and ''Biography Movies"'' debuted.&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;

History expanded in 1998 into tours of U.S. landmarks with Mayflower Tours having an affiliated website (historytravel.com), ''History Channel Traveler'', and a planned quarterly magazine. While in October, History and [[MSG Network]] teamed up to produce several short-form sports history programs.&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;

A+E spun out its first two digital cable channels in November 1998 with [[The Biography Channel]] and [[H2 (TV channel)|History Channel International]] from  A&amp;E and The History Channel. A&amp;E was spending $10 million per year to convert to the digital format and for digital distribution.&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;

AETN All Asia Networks was formed on April 2007 through a joint venture between A&amp;E Television Networks and Malaysia's pay TV provider [[Astro Holdings Sdn Bhd|Astro Overseas Limited]].&lt;ref name=dl&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tartaglione|first1=Nancy|title=Global Showbiz Briefs: Kris Kristofferson Pic 'Joe's Mountain' Gets Backers; A+E Nets Takes Over AETN All Asia; More|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/07/global-showbiz-briefs-kris-kristofferson-pic-joes-mountain-gets-backers-ae-nets-takes-over-aetn-all-asia-more/|accessdate=August 4, 2014|work=Deadline|publisher=PMC Media|date=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acquisition of Lifetime, further developments ===
In August 2009, A&amp;E Networks acquired [[Lifetime Entertainment Services]], which at the time was jointly owned by Disney and Hearst, each with 50% ownership. Following the deal, Disney and Hearst each held approximately 42% of the combined company, while [[NBC Universal]] retained approximately 16%. The deal included mechanisms by which NBCU could choose, or alternatively be forced to, exit the partnership over the subsequent 15 years.&lt;ref name=vty&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007820.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 A&amp;E Acquires Lifetime], ''Variety.com'', August 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/329151-A_E_Networks_Lifetime_Merger_Completed.php A&amp;E Networks, Lifetime Merger Completed], ''Broadcasting &amp; Cable'', August 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; AETN and [[Network 18|Network 18 Group]] In August 2010 formed a joint venture (49/51%), AETN-18 India, which would first launch the History and Bio channels in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=AETN forms alliance in India |url=https://variety.com/2010/biz/news/aetn-forms-alliance-in-india-1118022568/# |accessdate=December 6, 2013 |newspaper=Variety|date=August 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2011, A&amp;E Television Networks changed its brand name to A+E Networks. A&amp;E dropped TV as their brands had move beyond just the TV channel, while keeping Networks being contemporary to similar companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lafayette|first1=Jon|title=EXCLUSIVE: AETN Takes New Name -- A+E Networks -- And New Slogan|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/advertising-and-marketing/exclusive-aetn-takes-new-name-ae-networks-and-new-slogan/52603|accessdate=January 31, 2015|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media, LLC.|date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, NBC confirmed plans to divest its 15.8% stake in A&amp;E Networks by way of a [[share repurchase]] by A&amp;E Networks, making Disney and Hearst 50-50 partners in the joint venture.&lt;ref name=vty0&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldsmith |first=Jill |title=Comcast to sell A&amp;E stake for $3 billion: A&amp;E to redeem the 15.8% stake |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-10/entertainment/sns-201207101512reedbusivarietynvr1118056402-20120710_1_nbcuniversal-comcast-stake |accessdate=July 11, 2012|newspaper=Variety|date=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, A&amp;E announced that [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]] had acquired the home video distribution rights to its content, replacing [[New Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lieberman|first1=David|title=Lionsgate Picks Up Distribution Rights For A&amp;E Networks Home Videos|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/08/lionsgate-picks-up-distribution-rights-for-ae-networks-home-videos/#more-317000|accessdate=August 4, 2014|work=Deadline|publisher=PMC Media|date=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an early June 2013 promotion to A&amp;E Networks CEO, [[Nancy Dubuc]] launched a new in-house production unit, A&amp;E Studios, and hired veteran BBC executive [[Jana Bennett]] to serve as the president of Biography Channel and LMN.&lt;ref name=thr&gt;{{cite news|last=Rose  |first=Lacey |title=A&amp;E Executive Shuffle: DeBitetto to Run In-House Studio, New GMs at A&amp;E, Lifetime, History |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/a-e-executive-shuffle-debitetto-561909 |accessdate=December 5, 2013 |newspaper=Hollywood Reporter |date= June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, A+E Networks bought out Astro Overseas's stake in AETN All Asia Networks and renamed it to A+E Networks Asia.&lt;ref name=dl/&gt;

In December 2013, in response to stagnating viewership in comparison to its sister networks, it was announced that The Biography Channel would be re-launched as [[FYI (U.S. TV network)|FYI]], a lifestyle-oriented network, in 2014. The channel's new president, Jana Bennett, had previously overseen [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]'s early-2000's transition into a mainstream lifestyle channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thielman|first1=Sam|title=Bio to Rebrand as FYI, a 'Contemporary Lifestyle' Network|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/bio-rebrand-fyi-contemporary-lifestyle-network-154437|accessdate=July 7, 2014|work=Adweek|date=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/12/ae-networks-bio-renamed-fyi-as-it-converts-into-lifestyle-network|title=A+E Networks' Bio Renamed FYI As It Converts Into Lifestyle Network|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=December 11, 2013|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A&amp;E Networks Italy was established in December 2013, launching the local version of [[Crime &amp; Investigation]], as well as buying out the Italian version of History from its local partner, [[Fox International Channels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Briel|first1=Robert|title=A+E Networks establishes own Italian branch|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2013/12/09/ae-networks-establishes-own-italian-branch/|accessdate=March 27, 2017|work=Broadband TV News|date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, A&amp;E took a 10% stake in [[Vice Media]] for $250 million.

==== A+E Networks Latin America ====
A+E Networks Latin America is a joint venture between A+E Networks International and Ole Communications. The company started in 1996 when A&amp;E expanded into Latin America as '''Mundo Olé''', a joint venture between A&amp;E Television Networks and [[HBO Latin America Group]] with the Biography series. In 2000, the word Olé was dropped, causing Mundo Olé to become '''Mundo'''. The next year, Mundo was renamed to '''A&amp;E Mundo''' but continued airing the Biography series. The channel was renamed once more as '''A&amp;E''' in 2005. Back in 1992, History Latin America was launched as '''TVQuality'''. It continued to use that name until 2000, when it became '''The History Channel'''. From 2008, it is still '''History''' since then. The Biography Channel was launched in Latin America in 2007; however, when the US Bio. network became '''FYI''' in 2014, The Latin American network is now '''H2''' since then.

''“…I found somewhere to hide and tried to look back to see if I could see any sign of my father but I didn’t,”'' 

Fearing for his life, he said, he decided to "run for cover" and in the process lost communication and contact with the father during the chaos. In the process of running from the scene, seeking for cover, he was shot in the back but managed to make it to a hideout. After making it to the hideout, he looked around for signs of his father but couldn't find him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Arthur Witty Cotton''', also known as '''Don Arturo''', was a footballer, club president and businessman. Witty played for [[FC Barcelona]] in the first [[Copa del Rey]] final and later served as club president between 1903 and 1905. He was also a successful trader and his family company, the Witty Group, continues to operate today. He is the older brother of [[Ernest Witty]].

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Witty was the son of Frederick Witty, a British entrepreneur, who settled in [[Barcelona]]. Frederick, who belonged to a [[Yorkshire]] family, initially intended to emigrate to Argentina but was persuaded to go to Spain by friends. In 1873 he founded his own shipping agency under the name of F. Witty, subsequently establishing business links between Spain and the United Kingdom. Arthur and his brother, Ernest, were educated at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby|Merchant Taylors' School]] in Merseyside, where sport was regarded as a major part of a young man's development. While at Merchant Taylors, Arthur played as a forward for the local [[rugby union]] team, [[Waterloo FC]]. On their return to [[Barcelona]] the two brothers joined their father's company which now became known as ''Witty Sociedad Anónima'', Witty S.A.

=== FC Barcelona footballer ===
Arthur and Ernest returned to Spain with a love of sports. Unable to play [[rugby union]] due to a lack of suitable pitches, the Wittys began to organise [[association football|football]] games between company teams made up of employees. In 1899 Ernest also became a founding member of the [[Real Club de Tenis Barcelona]]. Ernest, a Spanish national tennis champion, played tennis with, among others, [[Joan Gamper]] and when Gamper founded [[FC Barcelona]] in October 1899, the Witty brothers quickly became involved. They used their company to imports regulation balls, referees whistles and nets from England. Legend also has it that the Witty brothers also imported the legendary club colours, the ''blaugrana'', from the original colours used by Merchant Taylors' rugby team. However [[FC Basel]] and other clubs that Gamper played for and his home canton of [[Zurich]] and have all been credited and/or claimed to be the inspiration. Either way, Old Merchant Taylors' BaaBarians hockey team carry FC Barcelona shirts as their away strip in tribute to Arthur Witty.

In early December 1899 the club played its first official game against an ''English Select'' at the ''Velòdrom de la Bonanova'', now known as ''Turó Park''. The teams only had ten men each and the ''English Select'' actually included several [[FC Barcelona]] players, among them, Arthur Witty. The ''English Select'' won the game 1–0 with Witty scoring the only goal. On Christmas Eve 1899 Witty made his official debut for the club in a 3–1 win over Català SC.

[[FC Barcelona]] was one of several football clubs formed in the city around this time and soon there was enough teams to organise a regular competition, the [[Copa Macaya]]. Witty was a member of the FC Barcelona team which won its first ever trophy, the Copa Macaya in 1902. He also played for FC Barcelona in 1902 when they were invited to enter the first ever [[Copa del Rey]]. After beating Madrid FC, later to become [[Real Madrid]], 3-1 in the first round, they lost 2–1 to [[Club Vizcaya]] in the final. Witty also helped the club win the [[Copa Barcelona]] in 1903. Between 1899 and 1905 Witty played 74 games, mainly as a full-back for FC Barcelona.

=== FC Barcelona President ===
Witty became president of [[FC Barcelona]] on 17 September 1903 after having previously served on the board of directors. During his presidency the club won the its first [[Catalan football championship|Championat de Catalunya]] with a squad that included Ernest Witty and [[Romà Forns]]. The latter was one of several young reserve players Witty introduced into the team. By now [[FC Barcelona]] had acquired a strong fan base within the city and Witty arranged for the club to play their home games at the ''Carrer Muntaner''. Witty also organised the club's first trip abroad which resulted in their first game against a non-Spanish team. On 1 May 1904 [[FC Barcelona]] beat [[Stade Toulousain|Stade Olympien des Étudiants Toulousains]] 3-2. The same opponents were then invited back to [[FC Barcelona]] to play the inaugural game at the ''Carrer Muntaner''. [[FC Barcelona]] won this game 4–0 with two goals from [[Joan Gamper]]. Witty stepped down as president on 6 October 1905.

=== After Barcelona ===
In June 1924 Witty briefly became involved in controversy when he invited the [[Royal Marines|British Royal Marine]] band that played ''[[God Save the Queen]]'' at [[Camp de Les Corts|''Les Corts'']], after their attempts to play the Spanish national anthem were jeered. As a result, Witty became disillusioned at the politicalisation of [[FC Barcelona]] club and, while remaining a fan, he gradually began to distance himself from the club. During the 1930s Witty and his son, Frederick Jr., established the family company as traders and helped introduce well known names such as [[Cadbury Schweppes|Cadburys]], [[Johnnie Walker]], [[Unilever]] and [[Bovril]] into the Spanish market. Witty also served as President of the Barcelona Ship Agents Association until 1936 and was a leader in the [[Barcelona]] and Spanish shipping communities. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] the company was exempted from a takeover by a workers committee as it was technically a British-owned company and it continued to trade successfully. During the [[Second World War]], Witty left Spain, leaving the business in hands of a lawyer. He returned during the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] years and regained his status as a leading shipping agent. Together with his brother he also opened a successful sports shop.

The European Commission's Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (previously the Return Fund, the Refugee Fund, and the Integration Fund) is a funding programme managed by the [[Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs]] which promotes the efficient management of migration flows and the implementation, strengthening and development of a common approach to asylum and immigration in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014R0516&lt;/ref&gt; All EU Member States except Denmark participate in the implementation of this Fund. Most of the funds are provided to the EU Member States for activities addressing previously agreed upon themes. A part of the funding is reserved for emergency assistance. A final part is reserved for Union Actions, which are European Commission managed projects that are developed as either calls for proposals, direct awards, procurements, or delegation agreements.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/financing/fundings/migration-asylum-borders/asylum-migration-integration-fund/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to providing funding for projects, the programme funds the activities and future development of the [[European Migration Network]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2198">A '''balanced job complex''' is a way of organizing a workplace or group that is both directly democratic and also creates relative equal [[empowerment]] among all people involved.

Specifically a balanced job complex is a collection of tasks within a given workplace that is balanced for its equity and empowerment implications against all other job complexes in that workplace. It was developed as an alternative to the corporate division of labor.

Each worker must do a share of rote tasks (unskilled work) for some time each work day or each week. All workers also share the most rewarding and empowering tasks in the workplace so it is coordinated with everyone's involvement. In this way workers share the burdens and benefits of work that impact each person's ability to participate in democratic decision-making within the workplace.

Balanced job complexes imply a lack of owners or formal managers involved in the workplace, as all tasks are balanced for empowerment.

Balanced job complexes are central to the theory of [[participatory economics]] which emerged from the work of radical theorist [[Michael Albert]] and that of radical economist [[Robin Hahnel]].

The concept of the balanced job complex was developed and put into practice at [[South End Press]] in the late 1970s.

In the 1990s, a series of worker-run collectives in [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada, were founded using parecon-inspired principles, including balanced job complexes, as part of their internal structures.  Most notable{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} in this regard have been [[Mondragon Bookstore]] and Coffee House, [[G7 Welcoming Committee Records]], and [[Arbeiter Ring Publishing]].

'''Business-IT alignment''' is a dynamic state in which a [[Company|business organization]] is able to use [[information technology]] (IT) to achieve business objectives - typically improved financial performance or marketplace [[competitiveness]].  Some definitions focus more on outcomes (the ability of IT to produce business value) than means (the harmony between IT and business [[decision-maker]]s within the organizations); for example, &lt;blockquote&gt; ''alignment is the capacity to demonstrate a positive relationship between information technologies and the accepted financial [[measures of performance]].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/alignment/ What is Alignment? Alignment is The Delivery Of The Required Results&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This alignment is in contrast to what is often experienced in organizations: IT and business professionals unable to bridge the gap between themselves because of differences in objectives, culture, and incentives and a mutual ignorance for the other group's [[body of knowledge]]. This rift generally results in expensive IT systems that do not provide adequate [[return on investment]].  For this reason, the search for business-IT alignment is closely associated with attempts to improve the business value of IT investments.

Business-IT alignment integrates the information technology to the strategy, mission, and goals of the organization. Key characteristics in order to achieve this alignment are:
#The organization must view information technology as an instrument to transform the business. This includes exploring other revenue streams and integrating other facets of their business into each other. For example, using one central [[data warehouse]] to combine two separate, but partnering businesses.
#An organization must hold customer service, both externally and internally, at the utmost importance. Communication between the organization and their customers must not be lost.
#An organization must rotate both IT and business professionals across different departments and job functions. They must have the knowledge and experience of both sides of the business so that understanding and communication is achieved. Once those three characteristics are achieved,
#An organization must provide clear and specific goals to both the IT and business employees. This will create the integration of both entities to achieve a common goal.
#Ensure that IT and business employees understand how the company makes or loses money. This is important so that money is not carelessly poured into the IT department and there is no return on that investment.
#Organizations must create a vibrant and inclusive [[company culture]]. There must not only be informational unity, but a company as whole.

It is not unusual for business and IT professionals within an organization to experience conflict and in-fighting as lack of mutual understanding and the failure to produce desired results leads to blaming and mistrust. The search for B/I alignment often includes efforts to establish trust between these two groups and a mechanism for consensus [[decision-making]].

== B/I alignment and IT governance ==

To achieve B/I alignment, organizations must make better decisions that take into account both business and IT disciplines. Establishing processes for decision-making and control is essentially what is meant by the term "governance"; so B/I alignment is closely related to [[information technology governance]].

A commonly cited definition by IT Governance Institute is:&lt;blockquote&gt;''IT governance is the responsibility of the board of directors and executive management. It is an integral part of enterprise governance and consists of the leadership and organisational structures and processes that ensure that the organisation’s IT sustains and extends the organization’s strategies and objectives''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sohanroy.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:BITAconcept.jpg]] --&gt;

Also related to the effort for better decision-making, and therefore often part of B/I alignment - is the area of [[IT portfolio management]], which has to do with decisions about which IT projects are funded and which are not.

== B/I alignment and business transformation ==

Ultimately, value must come not just from the IT tools that are selected, but also in the way that they are used in the organization. For this reason, the scope of B/I alignment also includes business transformation, in which organizations redesign how work is accomplished in order to realize efficiencies made possible by new IT.  Thus, implementing IT to achieve its full potential for business value includes not only a technical component, but also an organizational [[change management]] component (see the Risk3 model below).

It is important to consider the overall value chain in technology development projects as the challenge for the value creation is increasing with the growing competitiveness between organizations that has become evident ([https://web.archive.org/web/20101014034657/http://harvardbookstore.biz/ Bird, 2010]). The concept of value creation through technology is heavily dependent upon the alignment of technology and business strategies. While the value creation for an organization is a network of relationships between internal and external environments, technology plays an important role in improving the overall value chain of an organization. However, this increase requires business and technology management to work as a creative, synergistic, and collaborative team instead of a purely mechanistic span of control. Technology can help the organization recognize improved competitive advantage within the industry it resides and generate superior performance at a greater value, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101014034657/http://harvardbookstore.biz/] according to Bird (&lt;ref&gt;

== Alignment models ==

Henderson &amp; Venkatraman can be seen as the founding fathers of business/IT alignment and published an article called ''Strategic Alignment: Leveraging Information Technology for transforming organisations - IBM Systems Journal, vol32, NO1''.

Typical [[Enterprise architecture framework|EA Frameworks]] are used to achieve business-IT alignment, as these frameworks links business and technology layers of organization over common threads.

[[The Open Group Architecture Framework|TOGAF]] is a framework by Open Group which defines a very strong method of developing the enterprise architecture. The method is called ADM (architecture development method)

[[Zachman Framework|Zachman EA framework]] is developed by John Zachman and it defines which artifacts enterprises need to develop to be able to organize themselves better. It is also widely accepted framework in the industry.

In the Risk3&lt;ref&gt;[http://changethebusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/risk3.pdf Risk3 Assessment - Are You Managing the Three Risks that Threaten Your IT Implementation? (-- needs a paiement)]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; model, the objective of B/I alignment is to manage three separate risks associated with IT projects: technical risk (will the system function as it should?), organizational risk (will individuals within the organization use the system as they should?), and business risk (will the implementation and adoption of the system translate into business value?).  Business value is jeopardized unless all three risks are managed successfully.

'''Business acquisition''' is the process of acquiring a [[company]] to build on strengths or weaknesses of the acquiring company.  A [[merger]] is similar to an acquisition but refers more strictly to combining all of the interests of both companies into a stronger single company. The end result is to grow the business in a quicker and more profitable manner than normal organic growth would allow.  

==Process==
The process begins with defining the type of [[business]] that would make a good acquisition.  Generally businesses within the same segment or a highly complementary market segment are targeted. Once defined the target business is approached and if interest is shown [[due diligence]] is performed to ascertain the financial and other conditions of the business.

When the financial terms are agreed upon, and the contract is signed the merger portion of the acquisition begins.  Overlapping processes, personnel and products are evaluated and the better-performing pieces are retained.

==Single business acquisitions and split and sell==
A single acquisition refers to one company buying the assets and operations of another company and absorbing what is needed while simply discarding duplicated or unnecessary pieces of the acquired business.  "Split and sell" acquisitions involve buying an entire business in order to gain one or two pieces of the business.  The acquiring business may wish to retain the customer list and a product line, while moving manufacturing and other production related duties to an existing line.  In this case the excess is often sold off to recapture some of the acquisition cost.

==Affiliate acquisitions==
Businesses that use affiliates to sell and market their products may find themselves in the position of losing control of the marketing portion.  This presents a danger as the entire [[business cycle]] is dependent on the [[sales cycle]], which is now external to the business.  In this scenario the acquiring business may be forced into paying a premium to the affiliate, to regain control of the process without upsetting current customers and cash flow.  In rare instances the [[affiliate (commerce)|affiliate]] will gain so much influence that it can purchase the parent company.

== Risks ==
There are many risks related to business acquisition and a number of mergers or acquisition fail ending up inducing higher operating costs. There are a set of criteria that are usually followed to know if a business is a good target for acquisition such as : having operative processes, a profitable and documented customer acquisition strategy, good profits, a good customer retention strategy, etc.

'''Caspar Mathias Spoo''' (7 January 1837 – 17 March 1914) was a Luxembourgish industrialist and politician. 

Spoo was born in [[Echternach]] in 1837. His parents were workers in the earthenware factory, and died early. He joined the civil service from a young age, to make a living for himself and his siblings. He gave up his position in the postal service in order to open the ''Société Duchscher Frères et Spoo'' with André Duchscher, his old friend.&lt;ref name=industrie&gt;[http://www.industrie.lu/spooesch.html "Maschinenfabrik Spoo &amp; Co., Esch/Alzette"] industrie.lu&lt;/ref&gt; From 1886, he worked for two years as an accountant at the [[Dudelange]] foundry; he then struck out on his own in 1888 to open an ironmongery in [[Esch-Alzette]] with a workshop constructing ovens, cauldrons, etc.: the ''Maschinenfabrik Spoo &amp; Co''.

Additionally, he was politically active. He was elected to the communal council of Esch in 1893 and to the [[Chamber of Deputies (Luxembourg)|Chamber of Deputies]] in 1896.&lt;ref name=industrie /&gt; Along with [[Michel Welter]], he was one of the first people to engage in modern election campaigning in Luxembourg, by drafting and publishing a manifesto and giving speeches. Politically, he belonged to the left-liberal middle-class. Influenced by André Duchscher, he campaigned for [[universal suffrage]], progressive taxation and social security. He also called for the construction of an industrial school and a secondary school for girls in Esch, and demanded that the [[Esch-sur-Alzette (canton)|canton of Esch]], whose economic and demographic importance had increased due to industrialisation, should receive more seats in the Chamber. His social campaigning, in the [[paternalistic]] tradition of the 19th century, earned him the nickname "Pappa Spoo".

He was married to Barbe Kiesel, and was the father of Armand Spoo. At his funeral in Esch, Michel Welter gave a eulogy, calling Spoo the "conscience of Luxembourgish socialism."&lt;ref&gt;Muller, P.J. ''Tatsachen aus der Geschichte des Luxemburger Landes'', 1968. p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Luxembourgish language==

At his maiden speech in the Chamber on 9 December 1896, Spoo spoke in Luxembourgish, and demanded that Luxembourgish should be allowed in the Chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Speech in full in: Hoffmann, Fernand. ''Geschichte der Luxemburger Mundartdichtung, Bd. 1''. Luxembourg, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; His justification was the following: he argued that Luxembourgish was covered by Article 29 of the Constitution of 1868, which defined the official languages as German and French, and Luxembourgish was, after all, German — and indeed older and more venerable than so-called [[High German]]. He described it as one of the richest and healthiest idioms of the Germanic tongue, containing a treasure trove full of valuable language gems and words. The Chamber of Deputies voted on the question, whether Luxembourgish could be spoken in its sessions, and Spoo's proposition was almost unanimously rejected. 

Spoo was not the first one to speak Luxembourgish in a Chamber session: on 28 April 1848 in [[Ettelbrück]], while it was being debated if Luxembourg should participate in the [[Frankfurt Parliament]], Karl Mathias André changed in mid-speech from French to Luxembourgish, and received a reply from [[Norbert Metz]] in Luxembourgish, as "the public should understand everything." These were the first Luxembourgish words spoken in the Chamber. 

When the [[Education Law of 1912]] was being drafted, Spoo demanded that Luxembourgish should be an obligatory subject in primary schools, and was successful. He was supported in this by the prime minister [[Paul Eyschen]], and [[Nik Welter]] was tasked with writing the textbook ''Das Luxemburgische und sein Schrifttum''.

Spoo also wrote diverse articles on [[Michel Lentz]] and [[Dicks (writer)|Dicks]] in ''Ons Hémecht'' and the ''Natio'n'', and worked around the country to bring [[Michel Rodange]]'s satirical epic ''[[Rénert the Fox]]'', which had remained obscure until then, to a wider audience.

The doctors and scientists of Doheny Eye Institute undertake basic and clinical research, a role known as a [[physician-scientist]].

==History==
[[File:Carrie_painting.jpg|thumbnail|left|Painting of Carrie Estelle Doheny.|175px]]
In 1944, Carrie Estelle Doheny, wife of the prominent Los Angeles oilman [[Edward L. Doheny]], became blind in her left eye and began to suffer a progressive loss of sight in her right eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stein Eye Institute and Doheny Eye Institute Join Forces to Improve Patient Access to Top Vision Specialists|url=http://www.newswise.com/articles/stein-eye-institute-and-doheny-eye-institute-join-forces-to-improve-patient-access-to-top-vision-specialists|website=News Wise}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of vision inspired her to create and fund the organization named for her, the [[Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation]], in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carrie Estelle Doheny Foundation: Los Angeles Grants|url=http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/fundraising-los-angeles-grants/carrie-estelle-doheny-foundation-los-angeles-grants.html?SSScrollPosition=700|website=Inside Philanthropy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Foundation|url=http://www.dohenyfoundation.org/about/about-the-foundation/|website=Carrie Estelle Doheny Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation was formed with the purpose of supporting “the conservation, improvement and restoration” of human eyesight. The Doheny Pavilion, at [[St. Vincent Medical Center (Los Angeles)|St. Vincent Medical Center]] in Los Angeles, opened to patients in 1956. Drs. A. Ray Irvine, Sr., and [[S. Rodman Irvine]] served as co-Medical Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Narsing|title=Alexander Ray Irvine, Jr, MD|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1312084/pdf/taos00005-0043.pdf|website=National Institute of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. A. Ray Irvine, Sr., served as the personal ophthalmologist of Carrie Estelle Doheny, as well of American entrepreneur [[Walt Disney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander R. Irvine, MD|url=http://findingmickey.squarespace.com/disneyland-windows/single-gallery/2972732|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baby Care Center|url=http://disney-pal.com/Disneyland/baby_care_center2.htm|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, USC invited the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation Trustees to inspect an available parcel on the USC Health Sciences Campus, and negotiations to acquire the property began. In 1971, the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation finalized its formal affiliation agreement with USC, and named William H. Spencer, MD, as its new Medical Director, forming what was then called the "Doheny Eye Institute", known since 2013 as the [[USC Eye Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Courier-Journal|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/110135621/|website=Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Stephen J. Ryan became Medical Director and proposed the creation of the Doheny Eye Hospital, to serve as a new headquarters and provide clinical facilities for the ophthalmology faculty. The hospital was officially dedicated in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=$7.5-Million Doheny Eye Hospital to Be Dedicated|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-03-17/realestate/re-35605_1_facility|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keck School Dean Stephen J.

In 1987, the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation was renamed the Doheny Eye Institute, and a $32 million campaign was launched to build the Doheny Eye Institute building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Debs Hear Message of Inspiration From Cardinal-Elect|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-06/news/vw-408_1_patrick-doheny|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Stephen J.

In 2011, USC and the Doheny Eye Institute fell into a dispute over renovations, permits, and other matters related to the building, which led to litigation.&lt;ref name=Law360oct&gt;Alex Ortolani For Law360.

'''Edmund Jerome McCarthy''' (February 20, 1928 – December 3, 2015) was an American [[marketing]] professor and author. He proposed the concept of the [[Marketing mix|4 Ps marketing mix]] in his 1960 book ''Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach'', which has been one of the top textbooks in university marketing courses since its publication.&lt;ref name="Milestones"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Milestones in Marketing | journal=Business History Review | url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/Milestones%20in%20Marketing_Quelch_Jocz_cca1547e-d4e1-4470-8f92-edc877bebaf7.pdf|volume=82 |date=Winter 2008 | pages=827–838 | publisher= The President and Fellows of Harvard College | author1=[[John Quelch|John A.

In 1987, McCarthy received the [[American Marketing Association]]'s Trailblazer Award, and was voted one of the "top five" leaders in marketing thought by the field's educators.

==  Career ==
===Early career===
He was a professor of the College of Commerce at the [[University of Notre Dame]],&lt;ref name=PR /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scholar /&gt; beginning in 1956, where he taught courses about how statistics and mathematics applied to business problems.&lt;ref name=PR /&gt;

In the spring of 1959, while a professor of the College of Commerce, he was informed that he received a one-year [[Ford Foundation]] Fellowship at Harvard Business School and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=PR&gt;{{citation |url=http://archives.nd.edu/pr/pdf/PR_1959_03.pdf  |publisher=University of Notre Dame | title=University of Notre Dame, Department of Public Information (press releases) | author=James B.

=== Development of the 4Ps  ===
{{main|Marketing mix}}

At the time when McCarthy began his teaching career, the so-called ''functional school of thought'' dominated the discipline. The functional school was primarily concerned with asking questions about what are the functions of marketing, what activities does marketing perform, what is the role of marketing within organisations? Much of the theorising within the functional school focussed on the value adding services performed by intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;O'Malley, L. and Lichrou, M., "Marketing Theory," in Baker, M.J. and Hart, S., ''The Marketing Book,'' 7th ed., Routledge, Oxon, UK, 2016, pp 37-52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weitz|first1=Barton A|last2=Wensley|first2=Robin|title=Handbook of Marketing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjQb3xZoVe0C&amp;pg=PA19|date=October 16, 2002|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-0-85702-530-2|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the marketing discipline matured, scholars increasingly searched for a more managerial approach that focussed on solving the problems and challenges faced by marketing managers.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Constantinides"&gt;{{ cite journal | author=E. Constantinides | title=The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing | journal=Journal of Marketing Management |volume= 22 | year= 2006 | pages= 407–438| url= http://intranet.fucape.br/uploads/MATERIAIS_AULAS/25112-8.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1950s, a number of different approaches to managerial marketing emerged. However, some theorists clung to the functional approach, to the extent that both the functional approach and the managerial approach co-existed for a decade or so.&lt;ref&gt;Sheth, J. N. and Gardner, D.M., ''Marketing Theory: Evolution and Evaluation,'' New York, Wiley, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The demise of the functional approach has largely been attributed to McCarthy's contribution. According to Hunt and Goolsby, "The publication of McCarthy's ''Basic Marketing'' (1960) is widely cited as the 'beginning of the end' for the functional approach." The 1960s represent a transitional period wherein books adopting the managerial approach existed side by side with those using the more traditional functional approach.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Shelby D. and Goolsby, Jerry, "The Rise and Fall of the Functional Approach to Marketing: A Paradigm Displacement Perspective," in Historical Perspectives in Marketing: Essays in Honour of Stanley Hollander, Terence Nevett and Ronald Fullerton (eds), Lexington, MA, Lexington Books, pp 35-37, sdh.ba.ttu.edu/Rise%20and%20Fall%20(88).pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
[[File:4Ps.jpg|thumb|McCarthy defined the 4Ps conceptual framework for marketing decision-making, which used [[Product (business)|product]], [[pricing|price]], place (or [[distribution (business)|distribution]]), and [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] in the [[marketing mix]].]]

In 1960, McCarthy was the first to propose a marketing mix concept that resonated with both practitioners and academics.&lt;ref name=Dominic /&gt; In his textbook ''Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach'' (1960), McCarthy defined the 4Ps conceptual framework for marketing decision-making, which used [[Product (business)|product]], [[pricing|price]], place (or [[distribution (business)|distribution]]), and [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] in the marketing mix.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Constantinides" /&gt; McCarthy organized his text along managerial lines using the four Ps framework. The book's emphasis was on the problems facing the marketing manager, rather than looking at the characteristics of marketing systems and their functions. In addition to chapters devoted to the 4 Ps, the book also included chapters on consumer behaviour, marketing research and market segmentation to round out the tools available to marketers for use in problem-solving.

The managerial approach views marketing as a management science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laurent|first1=Gilles|last2=Lilien|first2=Gary L.|last3=Pras|first3=Bernard|title=Research Traditions in Marketing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwPsCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA386|date=December 6, 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-011-1402-8|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses problem-solving to "develop an optimum offering of products, prices, promotion, and place (distribution)," according to the ''Handbook of Marketing.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weitz|first1=Barton A|last2=Wensley|first2=Robin|title=Handbook of Marketing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjQb3xZoVe0C&amp;pg=PA54|date=October 16, 2002|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-0-85702-530-2|pages=19, 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key feature of the managerial approach is that it began to move away from its economics foundations and instead introduced ideas from the new and emerging fields of sociology and psychology, which offered useful insights for explaining aspects of consumer behaviour such as the influence of culture and social class.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Jones, D.G. and Shaw, E.H, "The History of Marketing Thought," in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Weitz, R. and Wensley, R.

Prior to the publication of McCarthy's text, the concept of a ''marketing mix'' was being debated, however, there was little consensus among marketers about what elements should comprise the marketing mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author=N.H. Borden | title=The Concept of the Marketing Mix | journal=Journal of Advertising Research | year=1964 | pages=2–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=N.H.

Borden of the Harvard Business School developed a complicated model in the late 1940s, based upon at least twelve different factors.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; In contrast, McCarthy's concept was a simplifed, memorable set of factors for managerial planning and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Dominic /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=W.A. Cohen | title=The Practical Drucker: Applying the Wisdom of the World's Greatest Management Thinker | publisher=American Management Association | year=2014 | page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy's marketing mix is based upon four controllable variables that a company manages in its effort to satisfy the corporation's objectives as well as the needs and wants of a [[target market]].&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; Once there is understanding of the target market's interests, marketers develop tactics, using the 4Ps, to encourage buyers to purchase product. The successful use of the model is predicated upon the degree to which the target market's needs and wants have been understood, and the extent to when the marketers developed the tactics accordingly.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;

McCarthy's 4Ps concept is particularly suited to most consumer products. The model needs modifications for high-end consumer products, in which case relationship management is a factor. Services have some unique marketing issues to be factored into decision-making. Tactics for marketing industrial products should consider elements of long-term contractual agreements.&lt;ref name="Sales Management" /&gt; Regardless of the modifications needed in some cases, the 4Ps remain a generally accepted marketing practice to influence buyers and its concepts still are espoused in contemporary textbooks.&lt;ref name="Milestones" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sales Management"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pundrik Mishra|title=Sales Management: Keys to Effective Sales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Gpa_kGJASMC&amp;pg=PA34|date=December 1, 2009|publisher=Global India Publications|isbn=978-93-80228-45-7|pages=34–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the 4Ps marketing mix that McCarthy popularized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael R.

Jocz wrote in their "Milestones in Marketing" (2008) article,  "Now, the marketing-mix concept is nearly always used in conjunction with the famous 'four Ps' categories... originated by E. Jerome McCarthy.&lt;ref name="Milestones" /&gt; They noted four years later that this book is one of the most widely adopted introductory texts in the history of marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=[[John Quelch|John A. Quelch]] | author2=Katherine E. Jocz | title=All Business is Local: Why Place Matters More than Ever in a Global, Virtual World | publisher=Penguin | year=2012 | page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} This is partly due to the simplicity of the model, which makes it adaptable for changes in the marketing area, such as internet commerce.&lt;!---"digital context", "digital technologies", "e-marketing", and "online companies" in the source---&gt; Rather than creating a new model, G. Dominic expressed that McCarthy's 4 Ps could be used with some "extension and adjustment" to develop tactics for the current, ever-changing marketing arena like internet commerce.&lt;ref name=Dominic /&gt;

===Planned Innovation Institute===
McCarthy played a pivotal role in the Planned Innovation Institute as founder, Advisory Board member, and consulting educator.&lt;ref name="PII" /&gt; Planned Innovation Institute was founded to identify causes and create solutions to address "major causes of new product failure in Michigan industry." It modeled its program's concepts after the University of Michigan Institute of Science and Technology research program.&lt;ref name="PII History"&gt;{{cite web | title= History | website=Planned Innovation Institute | url=http://plannedinnovationinstitute.com/History.html | accessdate=November 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy, with Frank R. Bacon, Jr., used the concepts from his ''Basic Marketing'' textbook to develop the institute's Product-Market Analysis component that first focused on new product innovation and then business retention strategies.&lt;ref name="PII History" /&gt; He traveled to India, South Africa, Latin America, and within the United States for its market-oriented planning and management educational programs. His clients included [[Dow Chemical Company]], [[Rockwell International]], [[Steelcase]], [[Bemis Manufacturing Company]], [[ALFA (Mexico)|Grupo Industrial Alfa]], Coredemex, [[Lear Siegler]], the Sarns division of [[3M]], and [[United Nations]] businessmen in Costa Rica.&lt;ref name="PII"&gt;{{cite web | title= Dr. E.

This term is often used synonymously with '''educational leadership''' in the United States and has supplanted [[educational management]] in the United Kingdom. Several universities in the United States offer graduate degrees in educational leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gradschools.com/search-programs/educational-leadership|title=Educational Leadership Graduate Programs and Graduate Schools|date=16 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''school leadership'' came into currency in the late 20th century for several reasons. Demands were made on schools for higher levels of pupil achievement, and schools were expected to improve and reform. These expectations were accompanied by calls for accountability at the school level. Maintenance of the ''status quo'' was no longer considered acceptable. ''Administration'' and ''management'' are terms that connote stability through the exercise of control and supervision. The concept of leadership was favored because it conveys dynamism and pro-activity. The [[Head teacher|principal]] or school head is commonly thought to be the school leader; however, school leadership may include other persons, such as members of a formal leadership team and other persons who contribute toward the aims of the school.

While ''school leadership'' or ''educational leadership'' have become popular as replacements for ''educational administration'' in recent years, ''leadership'' arguably presents only a partial picture of the work of school, division or district, and ministerial or state education agency personnel, not to mention the areas of research explored by [[Faculty (university)|university faculty]] in departments concerned with the operations of schools and educational institutions. For this reason, there may be grounds to question the merits of the term as a catch-all for the field.  Rather, the [[etiology]] of its use may be found in more generally and con-temporarily experienced [[neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] social and economic governance models, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom. On this view, the term is understood as having been borrowed from business.

In the United States, the [[Superintendent (education)|superintendency]], or role of the chief school administrator, has undergone many changes since the creation of the position—which is often attributed to the [[Buffalo Common Council]] that approved a superintendent on June 9, 1837. If history serves us correctly, the superintendency is about 170 years old with four major role changes from the early 19th century through the first half of the 20th century and into the early years of the 21st century. Initially, the superintendent's main function was clerical in nature and focused on assisting the board of education with day-to-day details of running the school. At the turn of the 20th century, states began to develop common [[curriculum]] for public schools with superintendents fulfilling the role of teacher-scholar or master educator who had added an emphasis on curricular and instructional matters to school operations. In the early 20th century, the [[Industrial Revolution]] affected the superintendent's role by shifting the emphasis to expert manager with efficiency in handling non-instructional tasks such as budget, facility, and transportation. The release of ''A Nation at Risk ''in 1983 directly impacted public school accountability and, ultimately, the superintendency. The early 1980s initiated the change that has continued through today with the superintendent viewed as chief executive officer, including the roles of professional adviser to the [[Board of education|board]], leader of reforms, manager of resources and communicator to the public.

==Graduate studies==
The term "educational leadership" is also used to describe programs beyond schools.  Leaders in community colleges, proprietary colleges, community-based programs, and [[University|universities]] are also ''educational leaders''.

Some United States university graduate [[Master's degree|masters]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral]] programs are organized with [[higher education]] and [[adult education]] programs as a part of an educational leadership department.  In these cases, the entire department is charged with educating ''educational leaders'' with specific specialization areas such as university leadership, [[community college]] leadership, and community-based leadership (as well as school leadership). [[Master's degree|Masters of education]] are offered at a number of universities around the United States in traditional and online formats including the [[University of Texas at El Paso]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coe.utep.edu/edlf/|title=College of Education|website=coe.utep.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Massachusetts]], [[Saint Mary's University of Minnesota]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Masters in Educational Leadership|url=http://onlineprograms.smumn.edu/mael/masters-in-educational-leadership|publisher=[[Saint Mary's University of Minnesota]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pepperdine University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsep.pepperdine.edu/masters-educational-leadership-administration/|title=MA in Administrative Services - Master of Arts in Educational Administration Degree Program - Pepperdine University GSEP|website=gsep.pepperdine.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Capella University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capella.edu/online-degrees/masters-leadership-educational-administration/|title=Masters in Educational Leadership &amp; Administration Online - Capella University|website=www.capella.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northcentral University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncu.edu/programs-degrees/education/educational-leadership|title=Educational Leadership}} {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520032503/https://www.ncu.edu/school-of-education/doctor-of-philosophy-in-education/educational-leadership/|archivedate=2013-05-20|url=https://www.ncu.edu/school-of-education/doctor-of-philosophy-in-education/educational-leadership/|title=Original link}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Scranton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Master of Educational Administration|url=http://www.uscranton.com/online-educational-administration/|publisher=[[University of Scranton]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some United States [[Graduate school|graduate programs]] with a tradition of graduate education in these areas of specialization have separate departments for them. The area of higher education may include areas such as student affairs leadership, academic affairs leadership, community college leadership, community college and university teaching, [[Vocational education|vocational]], adult education and university administration, and educational wings of nongovernmental organizations.

In Europe, similar degrees exist at the [[University of Bath]] and [[Apsley Business School - London]], where the focus is on the management systems of education, especially as British schools move away from state funding to semi-autonomous Free Schools and Academies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2304/rcie.2011.6.2.170|title=Free Choice, Free Schools and the Academisation of Education in England|first=Paul|last=Miller|date=1 June 2011|publisher=|journal=Research in Comparative and International Education|volume=6|issue=2|pages=170–182|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.2304/rcie.2011.6.2.170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apsley.eu/portfolio-view/mba-in-educational-leadership/|title=MBA in Educational Leadership|website=apsley.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact in these schools, the focus is on traditional MBA disciplines, such as HR, Change Management and Finance. The so-called "Academisation" of British education is highly contentious and political issue &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/feb/11/academies-schools-education-policy|title=The headteachers who fought off the academy brokers|first=Rhonda|last=Evans|date=11 February 2013|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many headteachers resisting moves to what they see as forced privatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schoolsweek.co.uk/schools-requiring-improvement-face-academisation/|title=Schools ‘requiring improvement’ face academisation - Schools Week|date=2 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mainland Europe, Educational Leadership is not taught formally, with senior educationalists having come through academic pathways, not administration &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X021004004|title=Educational Leadership and the Crisis of Democratic Government|first=Henry A.|last=Giroux|date=1 May 1992|publisher=|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=21|issue=4|pages=4–11|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.3102/0013189X021004004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature, research and policy==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
Educational leadership draws upon interdisciplinary literature, generally, but ideally distinguishes itself through its focus on [[pedagogy]], [[epistemology]] and [[Developmental psychology|human development]]. In contemporary practice it borrows from [[political science]] and business. Debate within the field relates to this tension.  Numerous educational leadership theories and perspectives have been presented and explored, such as: (a) [[instructional leadership]]; (b) [[Distributed Leadership|distributed leadership]]; (c) transformational leadership; (d) [[social justice educational leadership|social justice leadership]]; and (e) [[Teacher leadership]].  Researchers have explored how different practices and actions impact student achievement, teacher job satisfaction, or other elements related to school improvement.  Moreover, researchers continue to investigate the methodology and quality of principal preparation programs.

A number of publications and foundations are devoted to studying the particular requirements of leadership in these settings, and educational leadership is taught as an academic discipline at a number of universities.

Several countries now have explicit policies on school leadership, including policies and budgets for the training and development of school leaders.

In the USA, formal "curriculum audits" are becoming common, in which educational leaders and trained auditors evaluate school leadership and the alignment of curriculum with goals and objectives. Curriculum audits and [[curriculum mapping]] were developed by [[Fenwick W. English]] in the late 1970s.  The educational leaders and auditors who conduct the audits are certified by [[Phi Delta Kappa]]. Research shows how educational leadership influences student learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leithwood|first1=Kenneth|title=educational leadership|journal=educational leadership influences student learning|pages=3–36|url=http://www.wallacefoundation.org/knowledge-center/school-leadership/key-research/documents/how-leadership-influences-student-learning.pdf|ref=article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3944">'''FitzPatrick 1932''' is an early paper in the field of [[bankruptcy prediction]].  In a series of three articles in the monthly ''The Certified Public Accountant'' in 1932, Paul J. FitzPatrick presented data for 20 matched pairs of firms and discussed accounting ratios as indicators of bankruptcy.  It is historically significant as an early attempt in this field, and it is notable also for its publishing a data set, now in the public domain.  Beaver (1968), an important paper in accounting research which employs statistical analysis to a similar matched sample, cites the paper.

The dataset includes 13 accounting ratios calculated for 40 firms for each of three years.  However some fields are missing for some firm-year observations.

==History==
Gentiva Health Services was founded on August 6, 1999, when Olsten Corporation split off its healthcare assets to form an independent, public company. Olsten Corporation was founded in 1946 by William Olsten. The company grew through the 50s, 60s, and 70s, and in 1971, it began focusing on its health care division under the name Olsten Healthcare. In the 90s its health care division began acquiring other companies. The division acquired Upjohn Health Services, and after an acquisition of Lifetime Corporation, which included Office Angels, it became the largest provider of home healthcare services, operating as Olsten Kimberly QualityCare.&lt;ref name="Gentiva-History"/&gt; In 1995 Olsten Kimberly QualityCare launched CareCentrix, and a year later, the company entered the home infusion business by acquiring Quantum Health Resources.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reference for Business"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gentiva Health Services, Inc. - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Gentiva Health Services, Inc.|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/48/Gentiva-Health-Services-Inc.html#ixzz2sSwibpaw|publisher=Reference for Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year it acquired NeuroCare Rehab Without Walls, and became the sole national provider for Cigna HealthCare. It also acquired Nurses House Call, and in 1997, it changed its name to Olsten Health Services.

In 1999, Olsten Corporation split its healthcare division into an independent, publicly traded company, named Gentiva Health Services. In its first three years of independent operation, Gentiva launched its Gentiva Orthopedics, Gentiva Cardiopulmonary, and Safe Strides programs, it also sold its pharmaceutical services division to [[Accredo Health Inc.]]&lt;ref name="Newsday"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gentiva Makes $415M Deal|url=http://www.newsday.com/business/technology/gentiva-makes-415m-deal-1.458421|publisher=Newsday}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gentiva-Health-Services-Jan-2002-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1237/95016202000028/filing-main.htm |title=Gentiva Health Services, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Jan 7, 2002 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also sold its health care staffing unit to InteliStaf Holdings Inc. and the Carlyle Group.&lt;ref name="The New York Times1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gentiva Health Services to Sell Staffing Unit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/26/business/company-news-gentiva-health-services-to-sell-staffing-unit.html|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, it had acquired First HomeCare of Houston, Heritage Home Care Services, The Healthfield Group, Gilbert's Home Health and Hospice, Physicians Home Health Care and Hospice of Charleston. In 2008, it launched its Neurorehabilitation and Senior Health programs. In 2009, Gentiva moved its headquarters from [[Melville, New York]] to [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. In that same year, it acquired Mid-State Home Health, Magna Home Health, and Medicare-Certified offices of Coordinated Home HealthCare. In 2011, the company sold its majority stake in CareCentrix to Water Street Healthcare Partners.&lt;ref name="Gentiva"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gentiva to Separate CareCentrix Unit; Focus Exclusively on Home Care Operations |url=http://investors.gentiva.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=329351 |publisher=Gentiva |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222012236/http://investors.gentiva.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=329351 |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2011, the company closed or divested 34 home health branches and 9 hospice branches. It also sold its IDOA business to Premier Home Health Care Services, acquired [[Odyssey Healthcare]] of Augusta,&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gentiva to buy hospice care firm for $1 billion|url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/24/gentiva-to-buy-hospice-care-firm-for-1-billion/?src=busln|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold its Rehab Without Walls business to Southern Home Care Services. Its $1 billion purchase of Odyssey Healthcare was the largest hospice acquisition in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hallman|first1=Ben|title=Hospice, Inc.|url=http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/hospice-inc|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=24 March 2015|date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it acquired Advocate Hospice, Family Home Care Corporation and North Mississippi Hospice. In October 2013, the company acquired Harden Healthcare Holdings and Hope Hospice.&lt;ref name="Gentiva-History"&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Gentiva|url=https://gentivacareers.silkroad.com/gentivaext/About_Us/Company_History.html|publisher=Gentiva-History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2014, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. and Gentiva Health Services, Inc. announced that the companies entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Kindred would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Gentiva common stock for $19.50 per share in a combination of cash and stock. The agreement was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. Under the terms of the agreement, Gentiva shareholders will receive $14.50 per share in cash and $5.00 of Kindred common stock (which equates to 0.257 shares of Kindred common stock based upon an agreed upon fixed exchange ratio). The transaction is valued at $1.8 billion, including the assumption of net debt.&lt;ref name="Gentiva-Kindred"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kindred and Gentiva Reach Definitive Agreement |url=http://investors.gentiva.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=875404 |publisher=Gentiva |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012203504/http://investors.gentiva.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=875404 |archivedate=2014-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was officially signed into agreement effective January 31, 2015, with Gentiva becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Kindred.

'''''Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't''''' is a management book by [[Jim C. Collins]] that describes how companies transition from being good companies to great companies, and how most companies fail to make the transition. The book was published on October 16, 2001. "Greatness" is defined as financial performance several multiples better than the market average over a sustained period. Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. Collins finds the main reason certain companies become great is they narrowly focus the company’s resources on their field of key competence.

The book was a bestseller, selling four million copies and going far beyond the traditional audience of business books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bryant|first=Adam|title=For This Guru, No Question Is Too Big|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/business/24collins.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Collins used a large team of researchers who studied "6,000 articles, generated more than 2,000 pages of interview transcripts and created 384 megabytes of computer data in a five-year project".&lt;ref name=pw/&gt; Top members of this research team were:

==Seven characteristics of companies that went from "good to great"==
* Level 5 Leadership: Leaders who are humble, but driven to do what's best for the company.
* First Who, Then What: Get the right people on the bus, then figure out where to go. Find the right people and try them out in different seats on the bus (different positions in the company).
* Confront the Brutal Facts: The [[Stockdale paradox]]—Confront the brutal truth of the situation, yet at the same time, never give up hope.
* Hedgehog Concept: Three overlapping circles: What lights your fire ("passion")? What could you be best in the world at ("best at")? What makes you money ("driving resource")? 
* Culture of Discipline: Rinsing the cottage cheese.
* Technology Accelerators: Using technology to accelerate growth, within the three circles of the hedgehog concept.
* The Flywheel: The additive effect of many small initiatives; they act on each other like compound interest.

==Great companies==
Collins finds eleven examples of "great companies" and comparators, similar in industry-type and opportunity, but which failed to achieve the good-to-great growth shown in  the great companies:

{|

==Unsustained Companies==
Collins includes 6 examples of companies that did not sustain their change to greatness. These companies, "... are looked at separately as a clump":&lt;ref&gt;http://www.audiobooks.com/audiobook/good-to-great-why-some-companies-make-the-leap-and-others-dont/83046&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
The book was "cited by several members of [[The Wall Street Journal]]'s CEO Council as the best management book they've read."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Alan Murray | title=The Wall Street Journal Essential Guide to Management | publisher=New York: HarperCollins | year=2010 | pages=11 | isbn=978-0-06-184033-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called it "worthwhile", although "many of Collins' perspectives on running a business are amazingly simple and commonsense".&lt;ref name=pw&gt;{{cite news|title=GOOD TO GREAT: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... And Others Don't (Review)|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-662099-2|accessdate=2012-07-13|date=September 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Holt and Cameron state the book provides a "generic business recipe" that ignores "particular strategic opportunities and challenges."&lt;ref name=CultStrat&gt;{{cite book |last=Holt |first=Douglas |last2=Cameron |first2=Douglas |year=2010 |title=Cultural Strategy |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-958740-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven D. Levitt]] noted that some of the companies selected as "great" have since gotten into serious trouble, such as [[Circuit City]] and [[Fannie Mae]], while only [[Nucor]] had "dramatically outperformed the stock market" and "Abbott Labs and Wells Fargo have done okay". He further states that investing in the portfolio of the 11 companies covered by the book, in the year of 2001, would actually result in ''underperforming'' the [[S&amp;P 500]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.asmartbear.com/business-advice-plagued-by-survivor-bias.html&lt;/ref&gt; Levitt concludes that books like this are "mostly backward-looking" and can't offer a guide for the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levitt|first=Steven D.|title=From Good to Great … to Below Average|url=http://www.freakonomics.com/2008/07/28/from-good-to-great-to-below-average/|work=Freakonomics|date=2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins reaffirmed that "The books never promised that these companies would always be great, just that they were once great."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/by-the-book/2009/09/paranoia_your_best_friend.html|date=September 14, 2009|title=Paranoia: Your Best Friend|author=Clint Greenleaf|publisher=''[[Inc.

'''György Gordon Bajnai''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈɡordon ˈbɒjnɒi|pron}}; born 5 March 1968) is a Hungarian entrepreneur and economist, who served as the [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] from 2009 to 2010. Prior to that, he functioned as Minister of Local Government and Regional Development from 2007 to 2008, then as Minister of National Development and Economy from 2008 to 2009. In March 2009, following Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]]'s announced resignation, Bajnai was nominated by the ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] (MSZP) to become Hungary's next head of government.&lt;ref name="Edith Balazs and Charles Forelle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123840402537769209|title=Hungary's Ruling Party Picks Premier|author=Edith Balazs and Charles Forelle|date=31 March 2009|work=WSJ|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bajnai became prime minister when the parliament passed a constructive motion of no-confidence against Ferenc Gyurcsány on 14 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7972214.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Hungary parties back Bajnai as PM|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held the office until the formation of the [[Second Orbán Government]] following the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary election]].

Returning to politics, Bajnai established [[Together (Hungary)|Together 2014]], a coalition of left-wing and liberal political movements and civil organizations, in October 2012. The movement would have been an umbrella organization of centre-left parties to contrast Orbán's [[Fidesz]] in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2014|2014 parliamentary election]] with Bajnai as its prime minister-candidate, but negotiations have failed with the other opposition parties. Thereafter, the Together movement transformed itself into party on 8 March 2013, and Bajnai had gradually marginalized in the upcoming months. He retired from politics after the 2014 national and European Parliament elections.

== Studies and student politics ==
Bajnai was born in [[Szeged]] and raised in [[Baja, Hungary]], the son of György László Bajnai and Ágota Sóvári.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pesterlloyd.net/html/1326federvieh.html Politisiertes Federvieh – Hat Ungarn nur die Wahl zwischen “linker” und “rechter” Mafia?] Pester Lloyd / 26 - 2013, Politik 26.06.2013&lt;/ref&gt; He finished his secondary studies at the local [[Béla III High School]] in 1986. He graduated from the [[Budapest University of Economic Sciences]] (now Corvinus University) International Relations Department in 1991. For his public and professional activities he was rewarded Pro Universitate Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2014-01-15|url=http://www.demokrata.hu/ujsagcikk/a_csodbiztos_a_bajnai_gordon_sztori___resz/|title=A csődbiztos - A Bajnai Gordon-sztori 1. rész|date=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bajnai was very active in student-politics. In 1987, he organized a boycott of the University of Economics' canteen, and was the first chairman of the Independent Student Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nol.hu/archivum/archiv-469903 Antipolitikus politikus - Bajnai Gordon politikai portréja - A Political Capital elemzése], nol.hu&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the head of the History Department of Studium Generale, Admission Preparatory Studies College. In 1989, he, alongside [[András Schiffer]], participated in the establishment of the short-lived New Generation Movement (ÚNM), founded and led by [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/gazdasag/magyar/bajn060623/|title=Index - Gazdaság - Bajnai Gordon: A politika a legösszetettebb hivatás|author=Dudás Gergely|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entrepreneurial career ==
After earning his [[master's degree]], Bajnai took a job at Creditum Financial Consulting Ltd. In 1993, he undertook an internship at the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] in London. Later he also worked for Eurocorp International Finance Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;Bajnai Gordon&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1995 and 2000, Bajnai was the managing director of CA IB Securities Co., and was the Deputy Chief Executive Officer (at the same time when [[András Simor]], later head of [[National Bank of Hungary]], was the head of the company). Bajnai was leading, among others the IPO's of [[Richter Gedeon Co.|Gedeon-Richter]], [[MOL Group|MOL]], [[OTP Bank|OTP]], [[Magyar Telekom]], as well as some of the major [[M&amp;A]] transactions of this period.&lt;ref name=Business&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2000 and 2005, he was CEO of Wallis Rt., an investment company. His duty was to restructure  the holding-company, make it more efficient and to manage its investments. Wallis group member companies were at that time Graboplast Rt., Rába Rt., Elender Rt., Index.hu, WING, Wallis Auto Holding, Danubius Radio, Café Advertistment. In 2003, the National Association of Managers awarded Bajnai as the "Young Manager of the Year".&lt;ref name=Business/&gt;

Among the more than 100 Wallis-owned companies a poultry processing firm, Hajdú-Bét went bankrupt during 2003, against all efforts by its management and owners.&lt;ref name=Business/&gt; Many partners of Hajdú-Bét suffered serious losses during the time when the poultry market collapsed in 2003, Wallis group itself lost 10 billion forints (over 40 million Euros).&lt;ref name=Business/&gt;

Years later, when he started his political career, Bajnai was criticized for the Hajdú-Bét collapse, although won all the lawsuits against media-outlets for false accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/politika/belfold/baj627p/|title=Index - Belföld - Bajnai Gordon visszaszól|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20060703penzukert.html|title=A képviselők irodaházánál tüntettek a Hajdú-Bét károsultjai|author=ORIGO|work=origo.hu/|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he was Chairman of [[Budapest Airport]] (on behalf of [[BAA PLC|BAA]]), and member of the Supervisory Committee at [[Zwack]] Inc. He was a member of the Corvinus University of Budapest Economic Council. He resigned all of his company posts and board-memberships, when he entered the government as government commissioner, responsible for EU funds and national development.&lt;ref name=Business/&gt;

== Political career ==

=== Member of the Gyurcsány II Cabinet ===
Bajnai first received a government post in 2006. On 1 July, Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány's called on him to be the Government Commissioner for Development Policy. In this position, he was overseeing the National Development Agency, that controls EU Funds to Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2014-01-15|url=http://index.hu/gazdasag/magyar/8k060707/|title=Bajnai Gordon szétoszt 8000 milliárd forintot|date=2006-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became minister in July 2007, in the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development. After [[SZDSZ]] left the coalition government, in May 2008, he took over the newly formed Ministry of National Development and Economy. During his period as Minister, Hungary has won the right to host the [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]], and at the same time [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] has concluded a major FDI with the Hungarian Government in Kecskemét. From October 2008, Bajnai's activities had mainly focused on managing the evolving crisis in the real economy in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2014-01-15|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20090402-bajnai-gordon-tevekenysege-miniszteri-hivatali-ideje-alatt.html|title=Válság, adósság és az EU közt lavírozott Bajnai|date=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány resigned, announcing that he would hand over his position to a new premier with a higher support of the parties of the Hungarian Parliament.&lt;ref name="Hungary’s Premier Offers to Resign"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/world/22hungary.html?hp | work=The New York Times | title=Hungary's Premier Offers to Resign | first=Nicholas | last=Kulish | date=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hungarian PM offers to step down"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/03/21/hungary.pm/index.html|title=Hungarian PM offers to step down|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SZDSZ) opposed most candidates for the post proposed by the Hungarian Socialists. Although Bajnai was reluctant to give in, after a week, with no tangible results in sight, and being asked by the majority of party stakeholders, who also assured him of their support of the needed austerity measures, he took the job. Securing the backing of both parties, Bajnai became prime minister on 14 April 2009.&lt;ref name="Edith Balazs and Charles Forelle"/&gt;

=== Prime Minister ===
{{Further|Cabinet of Gordon Bajnai}}
[[File:GeithnerBajnai 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Bajnai met with [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary]] [[Timothy Geithner]] on 4 December 2009]]
The Hungarian [[Hungarian National Assembly|Parliament]] elected Bajnai as Hungary's Prime Minister with 204 votes for, 8 abstentions. The remaining 174 MPs did not vote.

In his first speech as PM, he promised drastic measures to stop the negative spiral of the Hungarian economy, and to ease the burden of the international crisis. He also stated that he would remain in power until he had the solid majority of Parliament behind his austerity package, but will stay no longer than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ca031bec-b468-11de-bec8-00144feab49a.html?nclick_check=1|title=Hungary remains vulnerable to turmoil, says PM|work=Financial Times|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=1157854921&amp;play=1|title=EU Pledged Support for Latvia: Hungary PM|website=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He did not want to nominate himself on [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|the next election]]; he undertook the task for only a year. [[Attila Mesterházy]] became the Hungarian Socialist Party's candidate for the position. The MSZP suffered its worst result since the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1990|1990 elections]]. The sixth [[National Assembly of Hungary]] formed on 14 May 2010. In accordance with the [[Constitution of Hungary]] Bajnai became "acting Prime Minister" for the following days. In his last speech he raised word against the [[Jobbik]] fearing for democracy given the party's radical views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blikk.hu/blikk_aktualis/vona-gardemellenyben-tett-eskut-2018558|title=Vona gárdemellényben tett esküt|work=blikk.hu/|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new cabinet formed on 29 May 2010. Bajnai was succeeded by [[Viktor Orbán]]. After that he retired from politics and returned to business life.

====Economic policy====
[[File:Papandreou and Bajnai 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Greek PM [[George Papandreou]] with Bajnai in March 2010]]
Bajnai took over an economy that was expected to contract by 6 percent in 2009 and was kept afloat by a $25.1 billion IMF-led lifeline. Foreign investors were declining to finance Hungary's high budget and then current account deficits, and the forint's weakness threatened hundreds of thousands of families who took out foreign currency mortgages. Bajnai must have had to cut spending to rescue the budget, keep within IMF guidelines and regain investor confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/world/europe/20iht-hungary.html?_r=1|title=In Hungary, Potential Lessons for Greece|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cabinet of Gordon Bajnai|Bajnai government]] had four main goals:
* Immediate crisis management (Activities: Stabilization of the financial system, Safeguarding jobs, supporting those who lose their jobs, Programmes to help the financing of SMS’s; Accelerating absorption of EU funds)
* Stimulating economic growth (Activities: Reforming the tax system; Extra-budgetary regulations; Extra-Measures to increase activity)
* Balancing the economy (Activities: Measures for the sustainable operation of the public sector; Improving the sustainability of the pension system; Creating a more targeted social system)
* Restoring Global trust (Activities: Restoring public order and confidence; Restoring confidence; Solidarity:state, politics, wealthy people; Anti-corruption measures; Helping pensioners; Providing continuous information to the public on Government activities; Establishing a national crisis Fund to help the most needy)

Handling the ruling Socialists might have been  his most difficult task. He needed their votes but a sizeable section of the party viewed Bajnai with contempt because cuts in welfare spending was seen as eroding the party's traditional voter base. Despite this, Bajnai made a reform in taxes, pensions, public sector bonuses, maternity support, mortgage subsidies, energy subsidies and public transport subsidies.

Within six months, he managed to present a new budget that reduced government spending by five percent of [[GDP]]. Hungarian economic policy has regained its credibility, CDS-spread was less than one third of the level of a year before.

In an interview given to Handelsblatt, Bajnai said: “Most of the painful decisions were taken during the first 100 days of my government” (…)“It was clear what Hungary had to do, even if it was not easy politically. (…) This required painful adjustments from the people. Our challenge was keeping things bearable while simultaneously creating better conditions for stable and sustainable development. We have accomplished that goal.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/europe/article2520313.ece/Pulling_Hungary_back_from_the_precipice|title=Pulling Hungary back from the precipice|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign policy====
His first visit abroad was in Brussels, where he debuted as Prime Minister. He had discussions with [[Jose Manuel Durao Barroso]], President of the European Commission, and with [[Jaap de Hoop Scheffer]], Secretary-General of [[NATO]].

[[File:I.brüssz.JPG|thumb|left|Gordon Bajnai with Barroso in Brussels.]]
In April he met with Austrian PM [[Werner Faymann]], in May, he attended the EU Partnership Summit in Prague. In May, he presented a speech on the Europe Forum, in Wachau, and in June, he attended the V4 summit in Kraków.  He made a two-day official visit to [[Israel]], where he met [[Shimon Peres]], [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and the Opposition Leader, [[Tzipi Livni]]. He also visited the [[Palestinian Authority]], where he met the Palestinian prime minister, [[Salam Fayyad]].

The Nabucco pipeline's intergovernmental agreement between [[Turkey]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], Hungary and Austria was signed by five Prime Ministers (including Bajnai) on 13 July 2009 in Ankara.&lt;ref name=bbc130709&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 August, he met with [[Angela Merkel]], Chancellor of Germany, in Sopron. The event  was the 20th anniversary of the [[Pan-European Picnic]]. In September he made a short official visit to Finland, where amongst others he met Prime Minister [[Matti Vanhanen]].
[[File:Wachajó.JPG|thumb|right|Gordon Bajnai presenting a speech in Wachau]]

On 10 September, he invited the Slovak PM [[Robert Fico]] to ease the tensions between Hungary and [[Slovakia]]. There were a clash of views between the two neighbors concerning the controversial amendment of the Slovak State Language Act. The two premiers expressed regret over the circumstances of a failed visit by President [[László Sólyom]] to [[Komárno]] on 21 August and agreed to accept all recommendations of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] high commissioner on national minorities. Prime Ministers Gordon Bajnai of Hungary and Robert Fico of Slovakia signed a joint statement during their meeting in [[Szécsény]].

Published on the [[Hungarian government]] spokesman's website, the statement declares the two countries' common interest in easing political tension. Bajnai and Fico agreed to direct the attention of all political parties to the social risks of confrontation, and called upon the citizens of both countries to show tolerance and understanding. They agreed to take resolute measures against extremist groups, and fight against all forms of [[xenophobia]], intolerance, [[chauvinism]], nationalism and violence, and the exportation thereof to one another's country. The two premiers declared that bilateral relations should be based on confidence, transparency and a pragmatic and constructive bilateral dialogue. They agreed to use all forms and instruments of cooperation, including further prime ministerial meetings.&lt;ref&gt;

In early October, Bajnai made a visit to the United Kingdom. He attended talks with [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Gordon Brown]] and gave a public lecture at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]]. Between 18–19 October, he made a short official visit to Paris, where he met president of France [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], PM [[François Fillon]], and many French investors.

Hungary sent more troops to [[Afghanistan]] in line with then current US strategy to enhance involvement there, Bajnai announced at a meeting with US Vice President [[Joe Biden]] in the [[White House]] on 4 December 2009. The pledge been made in several steps during 2010: Hungarian troops mainly serve in logistics and training operations, on top of helping to secure elections in Afghanistan, Bajnai told journalists after the talks.&lt;ref name=Afghanistan&gt;

At the beginning of 2010, Bajnai, as the Chairman of the [[Visegrád Four|Visegrád Four Grouping]] has invited ten countries from the [[Central and Eastern Europe|CEE]] region to sign a declaration for the support for stronger European energy policy cooperation and enhanced security of supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.neweurope.eu/article/visegrad-four-discuss-energy-cooperation-budapest-summit/|title=Visegrad Four discuss energy cooperation at Budapest summit|date=1 March 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months after retiring from public service, he founded the Patriotism and Progress Public Policy Foundation with some of his former government members and independent experts, which states on its website that its goal is "to shape the world view and attitudes of our citizens to build a better Hungary". "To realize this dream we will actively pursue a progressive agenda by learning from best practice and empowering communities to better themselves. We will amass and tutor the expertise and know-how to assist Hungary in facing the many tests it has to pass on the road to modernization."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hazaeshaladas.hu/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Autumn of 2011 he became adjunct professor at [[School of International and Public Affairs|SIPA]] Columbia University in New York, and held lectures and speeches at Rutgers University in New Jersey, Johns Hopkins University in Washington D.C., Princeton University, Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20110413/bajnais-office-confirms-former-pm-moving-to-new-york-for-two-months/|title=Bajnai’s office confirms former PM moving to New York for two months|work=Politics.hu|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.rutgers.edu/events/2011/10/13/politics-eurozone-crisis|title=The Politics of the Eurozone Crisis|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bajnai announced his return to politics on 23 October 2012, during the anti-government demonstration of the One Million for Press Freedom (Milla).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20121009/bajnai-said-to-announce-return-to-politics-on-october-23/|title=Bajnai said to announce return to politics on October 23|work=Politics.hu|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the protest, he called for an anti-Orbán coalition so as to form a supermajority in Parliament with the help of which the changes done by Orbán's ruling party, Fidesz could be undone.

In his speech, Gordon Bajnai repeatedly used a variant of the term ("''We may fail on our own, but together, we shall prove victorious!''"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazaeshaladas.hu/ftp/speech_of_mr_gordon_bajnai_-_23_october_2012.pdf|title=Gordon Bajnai's speech as published on the home page of his organization|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116131232/http://www.hazaeshaladas.hu/ftp/speech_of_mr_gordon_bajnai_-_23_october_2012.pdf|archivedate=2014-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he proclaimed his support for such a "''cooperation between hopeful left-wingers, disappointed rightwingers, politically abandoned free-thinkers and  committed  Greens''" that his organization along with two other civilian body named [[Together 2014]] (later simply known as "Together") as a reference to the date of the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2014|next general election]] in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20052322|title=BBC News - Mass rallies mark 1956 Hungary uprising|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, Bajnai announced his intention to be a parliamentarian candidate in the 2014 general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20121217/bajnai-says-plans-to-run-for-parliament-in-car-accident-in-budapest/|title=Bajnai says plans to run for Parliament; in car accident in Budapest|work=Politics.hu|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2014, five opposition parties entered into an electoral coalition and formed [[Unity (Hungary)|Unity]] alliance. In order to facilitate the creation of this alliance, Bajnai voluntarily gave up his candidacy of Prime Ministership, in favor of [[Attila Mesterházy]], the candidate of [[MSZP]], the largest party of this coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2014-01-14|url=http://www.politics.hu/20140114/quotable-antal-rogan-on-the-opposition-coalition/|title=Quotable: Antal Rogan on the opposition coalition|date=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unity, under the leadership of [[Attila Mesterházy|Mesterházy]] suffered a heavy defeat in the April election, nevertheless Bajnai was elected to the National Assembly from the second place of the alliance's joint list. Bajnai resigned from his parliamentary seat on 26 May 2014, and gradually withdrawn himself from domestic politics.

From September 2014, Gordon Bajnai returned to his original profession when he was named Group Chief Operating Officer of the [[Paris]]-based [[Meridiam]] infrastructure, a leading global investment fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2014-09-15|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20140902-multicegnel-helyezkedik-el-bajnai-gordon.html|title=Multicégnél helyezkedik el Bajnai Gordon|date=2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators on both the left and right political wing agreed that Bajnai was quitting politics with that step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2014-09-15|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20140915-veget-ert-bajnai-gordon-politikai-palyaja.html|title=Véget ért Bajnai Gordon politikai pályája|date=2014-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bajnai is currently in his second marriage. He has four children: Zsófia (1995), András (1998), Ágnes (2008) and Miklós (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://24.hu/belfold/2013/10/27/megmutatta-gyermekeit-bajnai-gordon/|title=Megmutatta gyermekeit Bajnai Gordon|date=27 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hafiz Mammadov ''' ({{lang-az|Hafiz Məmmədov|script=Latn|italic=no}}) (2 December 1964 in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], [[Azerbaijan]]), is a businessman who founded and owns the [[Baghlan Group]]. Mammadov also currently owns two [[football]] clubs across [[Europe]]: [[FC Baku]] in [[Azerbaijan]], [[RC Lens]] in [[France]].

==Biography==
Hafiz Mammadov founded the Baghlan Group in 1998 in [[Azerbaijan]]. The Baghlan Group is a company that specialises in oil, gas, construction and transportation, mainly in [[Azerbaijan]]. The Baghlan Group has grown since then and has seen Mammadov turn into a multi-millionaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.baghlangroup.com/?options=content&amp;id=6 |title=Chairman's message |work=Baghlan Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Mammadov turning into a multi-millionaire, it enabled him to invest in a sport that he loves - football. In 2004, he became owner of local football club [[FC Baku]], a team in the [[Azerbaijan Premier League]]. In 2013, he expanded his ownership of football clubs to two, when he bought [[RC Lens]] in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nord-pas-de-calais.france3.fr/2013/09/27/hafiz-mammadov-nouvel-actionnaire-majoritaire-du-rc-lens-fait-sa-premiere-apparition-publique-en-france-326835.html |title=Hafiz Mammadov, the new majority shareholder of RC Lens, made his first public appearance in France |work=Nord Pas-de-Calais |date=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RC Lens|Lens]] gained promotion that season under Mammadov's ownership from [[Ligue 2]] to [[Ligue 1]]. On 10 June 2014, Mammadov agreed to take ownership of another European football club - this time it was the English [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] . Mammadov looked to takeover over from the current Chairman [[Milan Mandarić]]. The bid for SWFC is rumoured to have been around €50 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southyorkshiretimes.co.uk/news/punters-embrace-new-boss-at-sheffield-wednesday-1-6666845&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.swfc.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-sheffield-wednesday-announce-takeover-confirmation-1628989.aspx |title=Sheffield Wednesday announce takeover confirmation |work=www.swfc.co.uk |date=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 28 August 2014, this takeover had still not been completed and at the beginning of September, due to failure to meet financial obligations and complete the takeover, Milan Mandarić called the deal off. He also owns shares in [[La Liga]] club [[Atlético Madrid]] and he still hasn't put £4 million into Lens for transfers resulting in Lens fans calling for a boycott of the clubs main shirt sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/nord-pas-de-calais/2014/08/26/rc-lens-lasses-par-mammadov-des-supporters-appellent-au-boycott-du-sponsor-maillot-azerbaidjanais-538314.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, it was announced by number of media that he is having financial difficulties, which forced number of players and personnel from [[Baku FC]] to seek new clubs, leaving club's future uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:СМИ: Клуб Хафиза Мамедова покупает форму на бакинской "толкучке"|url=http://sportbox.az/azerbaijan-soccer/97419/smi-klub-hafiza-mamedova-pokupaet-formu-na-bakinskoj-tolkuchke|website=sportbox.az|accessdate=24 July 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Клуб азербайджанского олигарха Хафиза Мамедова не выплачивает зарплаты футболистам|url=http://novosti.az/sport/20140507/300334140.html|website=novosti.az|accessdate=24 July 2014|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715124535/http://novosti.az/sport/20140507/300334140.html|archivedate=15 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horace Jansen Beemer''' ([[Circa|c.]] 1845 &amp;ndash; July 22, 1912) was a railway contractor and businessman.

There is little known of Beemer before he came to Canada in the 1870s and was employed on the [[Welland Canal]]. He was soon involved in contracts of his own including a municipal water system in [[Quebec City]]&lt;ref&gt;http://histoire-du-quebec.ca/horace-beemer-et-son-aqueduc/&lt;/ref&gt; and a railway contract with the [[:fr:Quebec and Lake St-John Railway]]&lt;ref&gt;http://hedley-junction.blogspot.com/2010/11/presentation-du-reseau.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Up until about 1900, his business interest grew and prospered. After that time, his activity and influence diminished.

While Horace Beemer never became a top level decision-maker and financier, he did contribute substantially to the construction of railways and operation of related businesses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25096">The '''International Electrical Congress''' was a series of international meetings, from 1881 - 1904, in the then new field of [[electrical engineering|applied electricity]]. The first meeting was initiated by the French government, including official national representatives, leading scientists, and others. Subsequent meetings also included official representatives, leading scientists, and others. Primary aims were to develop reliable standards, both in relation to electrical units and electrical apparatus.

==Historical background==
In 1881, both within and across countries, different electrical units were being used. There were at least 12 different units of electromotive force, 10 different units
of electric current and 15 different units of resistance.&lt;ref name=Petley483&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petley, B.W.|first= |date=1994-95 |title=A Brief History of the Electrical Units to 1964 |url=http://stacks.iop.org/0026-1394/31/i=6/a=007 |subscription=yes|journal=Metrologia |volume=31 |page=483 |doi= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other international Congresses were held, and sometimes referred to as International Electrical Congress, Electrical Conference, and similar variations. Secondary sources make different judgments about how to classify the Congresses.  In this article, the Congresses with representatives from national governments are identified as ''International Electrical Congress''. Other Congresses — often addressing the same issues  — are identified here as ''Concurrent Related International Electrical Congresses''. Some of these related conferences were devoted to preparing for an International Electrical Congress.

In 1906 the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title = Overview: Summary |work = IEC History
 |publisher  = International Electrotechnical Commission  |url = http://www.iec.ch/about/history/overview |accessdate = 2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congresses were organised under its auspices were also sometimes referred to as ''International Electrical Congress''. In this article, Congresses organized by the Commission are listed under ''International Electrotechnical Congresses'', while other related Congresses are listed under ''Related International Electrotechnical Conferences''.

===1905 in Berlin===
''Internationale Konferenz über Elektrische Masseinheiten'' (International Conference on Electrical Units)

Held 23-25 October at [[Physikalisch-Technischen Reichsanstalt]] at [[Charlottenburg]]. The 1904 Congress recommended holding an international conference to address discrepancies in the electrical units and their interpretation. [[Emil Warburg]], president of the [[Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt]] in Germany, invited representatives from corresponding national laboratories in the United States ([[National Bureau of Standards]]), the United Kingdom ([[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]]), and the official standards commissions in Austria and Belgium to an informal conference on electrical standards and units.&lt;ref name=L244&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Lagerstrom |first=L.R. |date=1992 |title=Constructing uniformity: The standardization of international electromagnetic measures, 1860-1912 |type=doctoral dissertation |chapter= |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url= |access-date=}}pp. 243-244&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally Mascart (France), Rayleigh (United Kingdom) and [[Henry Smith Carhart |Carhart]] (USA) were invited because of their expertise and influence.&lt;ref name=L244/&gt; Thirteen of the fifteen invited persons participated in the conference, six from the Reichsanstalt, two from the Belgian Commission on Electrical Units, two from the Austrian Commission on Standardization, [[Richard Glazebrook]] from the National Physical Laboratory, Mascart, and Carhart.

The '''Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada''' ('''IIROC'''; ''Organisme Canadien de réglementation du commerce des valeurs mobilières'' or ''OCRCVM'' in French) is a non-profit, national [[self-regulatory organization]] (SRO). Established through the merger of the [[Investment Dealers Association of Canada]] (IDA) and [[Market Regulation Services Inc.]] (RS) on June 1, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/MarketRegulation/SRO/sro_index.jsp|title=Self-regulatory organizations (SROs) |publisher=[[Ontario Securities Commission]] |accessdate=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  IIROC oversees all investment dealers and trading activity on debt and equity markets in [[Canada]].

The organization sets regulatory and investment industry standards and has quasi-judicial powers in that it holds enforcement hearings and has the power to suspend, fine and expel members and registered representatives, such as advisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investmentexecutive.com/client/en/News/DetailNews.asp?Id=45560&amp;cat=8&amp;IdSection=8&amp;PageMem=&amp;nbNews= |title=IIROC imposes $2 million fine on TD Waterhouse |first=Kate |last=Betts-Willmott |work=[[Investment Executive]] |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2008-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has often been criticized by investor advocates as ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investorvoice.ca/IDA/Comset/Comset_12Feb07.htm |title=Advocate flouts regulator |first=Gary |last=Norris |work=[[The Canadian Press]] |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2008-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

IIROC was formed on June 1, 2008 through the merger of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (IDA) and Market Regulation Services Inc. (RS).

The Bond Dealers Section of the [[Toronto Board of Trade]] was formed in 1916 as a trade organization to coordinate financing of Canada's war effort.  It was renamed the Investment Dealers Association of Canada in 1934.  Throughout most of its history, the IDA serve both as a regulator and as an advocacy organization for the securities dealers.  In 2006, IDA narrowed its focus to regulation and transferred its industry association role to a new separate and independent industry association, the Investment Industry Association of Canada.

Market Regulation Services Inc. was formed in 2008 in response to the implementation of National Instruments 21-101 ''Marketplace Operation'' and 23-101 ''Trading Rules'', which require an independent regulation services provider to regulate trading in all Canadian marketplaces, including the [[Toronto Stock Exchange|TSX]].

==Management==
Andrew J. Kriegler was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of IIROC on November 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://business.financialpost.com/2014/09/03/andrew-kriegler-iiroc/&lt;/ref&gt; Before joining IIROC, Kriegler was Deputy Superintendent at Canada's banking regulator, the [[Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (Canada)|Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions]], or OSFI, where he was responsible for supervising hundreds of federally regulated financial institutions.

Kriegler succeeds Susan Wolburgh Jenah, who headed IIROC's predecessor, the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (IDA) before becoming IIROC's first President and CEO in 2008. At the IDA, she had taken over the post from [[Joe Oliver (politician)|Joe Oliver]], who was alter elected as a Member of Parliament and went on to serve as federal [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]].

==Operations==
IIROC operates under Recognition Orders from the [[Canadian Securities Administrators]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investmentexecutive.com/client/en/News/DetailNews.asp?IdPub=163&amp;Id=44367&amp;cat=27&amp;IdSection=27&amp;PageMem=&amp;nbNews= |title=Long wait almost over for merged regulator |last=Langton |first=James |work=[[Investment Executive]] |date=May 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (CSA), which is the umbrella for Canada's provincial and territorial securities regulators. IIROC is subject to CSA oversight and regular operational reviews.

===Regulatory failures===
====Loss of unencrypted private investor data====
The CSA (Canadian Securities Administrators) investigated IIROC for the loss of personal financial data of thousands of brokerage clients after IIROC announced that it lost a mobile device containing the information.  The device had not been encrypted, which is in violation of IIROC policy.  The case reviewed IIROC's current policies, controls and procedures around information security.&lt;ref name="IE CSA Review"&gt;{{cite news | title = CSA reviewing IIROC data loss | publisher = [[Investment Executive]] | url = http://www.investmentexecutive.com/-/csa-reviewing-iiroc-data-loss | accessdate = 26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
More than 50,000 Canadian brokerage clients, from 32 investment firms, had personal financial information on the device.  At least one source has called the incident a cover up.&lt;ref name="FP Explanation"&gt;{{cite news | title = IIROC broke own rules by losing private data — can we believe its explanation | publisher = [[The Financial Post]] | url = http://business.financialpost.com/2013/04/29/iiroc-broke-its-own-rules-by-losing-data-device-can-we-believe-its-explanation/ | date = 29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charges against David Berry====
IIROC charged David Berry with securities law violations that were used by Scotiabank as grounds for his dismissal.  David Berry claims his dismissal and the reputation damage stemming from the IIROC charges have cost him $105M dollars. 
&lt;ref name="Scotiabank Fallout"&gt;{{cite news | title = Scotiabank explored fallout of cutting star trader's $15M pay months before he was fired, documents suggest | publisher = [[Financial Post]] | url = http://business.financialpost.com/2012/10/19/scotiabank-explored-fallout-of-cutting-star-traders-15m-pay-months-before-he-was-fired-documents-suggest/ |date = 19 Oct 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ruling on January 15, 2013, more than seven years after the initial accusation, a hearing panel of the IIROC dismissed all charges against Berry.
&lt;ref name="FP Broke Own"&gt;{{cite news | title = Former top Scotiabank trader cleared of allegations that led to his $100M wrongful dismissal lawsuit | publisher = [[The Financial Post]] | url =  http://business.financialpost.com/2013/01/15/iiroc-charges-against-david-berry-dismissed/ |date = 15 January 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charges against Blackmont Capital Inc. and Dean Shannon Duke====
In September 2010, IIROC contended that a Vancouver brokerage firm, Blackmont Capital Inc., and an employee, Dean Shannon Duke, acted against two IIROC rules in agreeing to share trading commissions with a third party.  In December 2010, IIROC imposed penalties on both Blackmont Capital and Duke for splitting commissions with people associated with a client without the client's written consent.  IIROC also imposed penalties for not disclosing the commission-sharing arrangement with its clients.  Blackmont Capital and Duke were assessed a total of $857,500 in fines by IIROC.&lt;ref name= blackmont/&gt;

In 2011, the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) overturned IIROC's decision and penalties against Blackmont Capital and Duke.  A BCSC appeal panel contended that Blackmont and Duke's act of not disclosing their commission-sharing arrangement was not against public interest.  The BCSC reversed IIROC's verdict and the imposing of its fines.&lt;ref name="blackmont"&gt;{{cite news | title = Investment Industry Regulatory Organization deserves credit for decision in Blackmont Capital case | publisher = canada.com | url = http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=b666e47b-f235-4d9b-a75c-18580f245a2a |date = 5 Nov 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charges against Evergreen Securities CCO====
An Oct. 2012 IIROC Hearing Panel dismissed all allegations made by IIROC against Evergreen Capital Partners Inc. executives Loretta Carbonelli and Gerald T.Conway. 
&lt;ref name="IIROC News Release"&gt;{{cite news | title = IN THE MATTER OF Loretta Carbonelli and Gerald Trevor Conway - Allegations Dismissed | publisher = [[IIROC]] | url = http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1055453/in-the-matter-of-loretta-carbonelli-and-gerald-trevor-conway-allegations-dismissed |date = 18 October 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charges against Vic Alboini and Northern Securities Inc.====
In 2012, IIROC contended that activist investor, Vic Alboini, and two other executives at Northern Securities Inc. had improperly obtained credit for Jaguar Financial Corporation and had risked Northern Securities as a result.  IIROC penalized Alboini with a suspension of two years, a permanent ban from being an "ultimate designated person" and fines totaling $750,000.

Northern Securities appealed IIROC's decision to the [[Ontario Securities Commission]] (OSC).  The OSC overturned one count against Alboini and Northern Securities, namely that Alboini and Northern Securities had not corrected deficiencies found in IIROC compliance reviews.  The OSC also overturned IIROC's penalties against Alboini and Northern Securities, saying that IIROC should not have announced serious penalties at the same time as their decision.&lt;ref name="northern"&gt;{{cite news | title = IIROC won’t hold new hearing into compliance issues, Alboini says | publisher = [[The Globe and Mail]] | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/iiroc-wont-hold-new-hearing-into-compliance-issues-says-alboini/article16920727/ |date = 5 Nov 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charges against Carolann Steinhoff====
IIROC imposed charges against broker, Carolann Steinhoff.  Focusing on Steinhoff's activities between 2004 and 2007, IIROC contended that Steinhoff had instructed her assistants to falsify client documents and that she had obstructed IIROC investigations.  Part of IIROC's contentions related to Steinhoff's instruction to her assistant to cut and paste a client's signature from an existing form to an unsigned guarantee.

In 2011, the BCSC overturned IIROC's decision against Steinhoff.  In overturning IRROC's decision, the BCSC stated that IIROC's ruling against Steinhoff was not supported by the objective evidence, but was made on the basis of character evidence.  The BCSC panel also concluded that Steinhoff was entitled to defend herself and therefore overturned the charges against her for obstructing IIROC's investigation.&lt;ref name="steinhoff"&gt;{{cite news | title = Victoria-based broker Carolann Steinhoff’s punishment too harsh, BCSC rules| publisher = [[The Vancouver Sun]] | url = http://www.vancouversun.com/business/Victoria+based+broker+Carolann+Steinhoff+punishment+harsh+BCSC+rules/8765577/story.html |date = 8 Aug 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jurisdiction over former members dispute====
The organization has been involved in litigation over its power to discipline former members for their conduct while they were members. An [[Ontario Divisional Court]] decision in the matter of Stephen Taub ruled the [[Ontario Securities Act]] does not allow this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://secure.globeadvisor.com/servlet/ArticleNews/story/gam/20080723/LAWCOLUMN23 |first=Jacquie |last=McNish |title=Lawyer finds gaping hole in securities law. |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2008-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] reached a different conclusion in the matter of [[Charles Dass]] and upheld a decision of the [[British Columbia Securities Commission]] that IIROC does have jurisdiction over former members.&lt;ref&gt;Investment Dealers Association of Canada v. Dass,  2008 BCCA 413&lt;/ref&gt; Later the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] reversed the [[Divisional Court]] decision and reached the same conclusion as the British Columbia Court.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taub v. Investment Dealers Association of Canada]], 2009 ONCA 628&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]], provincial securities regulations state explicitly that self-regulatory organizations have the power to pursue enforcement activities with regards to former members.

'''James Reynolds Bath''' (born August 18, 1936) is a Texas businessman who has business interests in aircraft sales and leasing and real estate. He is best known for his business relationships with Saudi businessmen [[Salem bin Laden]] and [[Khalid bin Mahfouz]].

==Biography==
Bath was born in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]]. In 1965, he moved to Houston, where he became an aircraft broker.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Craig. ''House of Bush House of Saud''. Scribner. 2004. 19. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-5339-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Bath met [[Salem bin Laden]] when bin Laden was interested in purchasing a used aircraft.&lt;ref name = "Coll"&gt;{{Cite book| edition = Reprint| publisher = Penguin Books| isbn = 978-0-14-311481-9| last = Coll| first = Steve| title = The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century| location = New York| date = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salem bin Laden was the son of [[Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden|Mohammed bin Laden]], founder of the [[Saudi Binladin Group]], one of the largest construction companies in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Salem was the oldest of Mohammed's 54 children, and a half brother of [[Osama bin Laden]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Through this acquaintance, Bath eventually became bin Laden's business representative in the United States, representing him in a number of business deals, including real estate, aircraft services, and banking. Through bin Laden, Bath also met Khalid bin Mahfouz, the son of Salem Bin Mahfouz, founder of [[National Commercial Bank]], now the largest bank in Saudi Arabia, and for a time represented him as well.&lt;ref name = Coll /&gt;

==Bath and George W. Bush==
Bath was also an acquaintance of former president [[George W. Bush]], whom he met when both men were serving in the Texas Air National Guard in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, 33&lt;/ref&gt;  After Bush started his first business, [[Arbusto Energy]], Bath invested $50,000 in the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, 116&lt;/ref&gt;  A former business partner of Bath, Charles White, who was involved in a number of suits against Bath, claimed in a 2003 interview with [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] that the investment in fact came from bin Mahfouz and bin Laden, and amounted to over a million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Conspiracy Theories: The Saudi Connection |work=CBC News: the fifth estate |accessdate=2015-10-18 |date=2003-10-29 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/conspiracytheories/saudi.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710092544/http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/conspiracytheories/saudi.html |archivedate=July 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Bush and Bath have denied this, and according to journalist Craig Unger, who examined the relationship between the Bushes and Saudi financiers in his 2004 book ''House of Bush, House of Saud'' there is no evidence to support it.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, 101&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7307">'''Jane Franklin Mecom''' (March 27, 1712 – May 7, 1794) was the youngest sister of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and was considered one of his closest confidants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/09/the-tale-of-benny-and-jenny/|title = The tale of Benny and Jenny|date = 21 September 2012|accessdate = 4 November 2015|website = news.harvard.edu|publisher = Harvard Gazette|last = Ireland|first = Corydon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mecom and Franklin corresponded throughout the course of their lives, and some of their letters survive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl van Doren]], ed., ''The Letters of Benjamin Franklin and Jane Mecom'' ([[Princeton University Press]], 1950); Carl van Doren, ''Jane Mecom, or, The Favorite Sister of Benjamin Franklin: Her Life here first narrated from their entire surviving correspondence'' (NY: Viking Press, 1950)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Mecom never attended school, she learned to read and write under the tutelage of Benjamin Franklin.&lt;ref name=almanac/&gt; In 1723 Benjamin ran away to become a printer in New York and escape his indenture to his brother, leaving his 11-year-old sister alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/01/01-01138.html?a=1&amp;n=Jane%20Franklin&amp;ia=-at&amp;ib=-bib&amp;d=10&amp;ss=0&amp;q=1|title=American National Biography Online|website=www.anb.org|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 15 she was married off, although the legal marrying age in Massachusetts was 16, and her brothers and most of her sisters had married by 24, none of them before 20. Even more startlingly, she was married to a nearly illiterate 22-year-old saddler, Edward Mecom, a poor Scottish immigrant whose swings of mental instability were inherited by at least two of his sons. Constantly in deep debt, he spent much of his marriage in debtors' prison, leaving his wife to be the family breadwinner. None of her letters reveal evidence that she had any affection for this man. Therefore, the motive for this marriage is a mystery. [[Jill Lepore]], the primary and only historian so far of Jane Franklin, theorizes that the young girl could have had an affair and become pregnant out of wedlock from it, and the marriage was an attempt to save the family dignity. Lepore bases this theory on interpretations of one of Benjamin’s earliest letters to Jane that scolds her for being overly sexual.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Susan. "The Other Franklin." Review of Book Of Ages: The Life And Opinions Of Jane Franklin, by Jill Lepore. The New York Review Of Books. Last modified 3013. Accessed October 27, 2016.&lt;nowiki&gt;https://web.williams.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;
humanities/sdunn/articles/The%20Other%20Franklin.pdf.
&lt;/ref&gt; If there had been a child she miscarried it; her first son, Josiah Mecom, was born two years later and she named him for her father. He died three weeks before his first birthday. While it has been suggested that Benjamin Franklin gave Mecom a spinning wheel as a wedding gift, Lepore argued that this was a misreading of a joke made by Franklin in a letter to his sister.&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Anne Firor|title=Making the Invisible Woman Visible|year=1984|publisher=University of Illinois Press|pages=5–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlJ6zp3kXGIC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lepore|first=Jill|title=Book of Ages: The Life and Opinions of Jane Franklin|date=2013|publisher=Knopf|isbn=9780307958341|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3QXdUL4CFIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=book%20of%20ages&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=book%20of%20ages&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jane and Edward Mecom had twelve children: Josiah Mecom I, Edward "Neddy" Mecom, Benjamin "Benny" Mecom, Ebenezer Mecom, Sarah "Sally" Mecom, Peter Franklin Mecom, John Mecom, Josiah Mecom, Jane Mecom, James Mecom, Mary "Polly" Mecom, and Abiah Mecom.

One son, Benjamin, disappeared during the Battle of Trenton.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt; Two of her sons struggled with mental illness. Mecom made efforts to keep her children out of debtors' prison, the almshouse, and asylums. Several of them succumbed to an illness now believed to be [[tuberculosis]]. The religious beliefs of the time taught people not to fear death. In fact, because many children (about 25%) did not live past the age of 10, children were taught not to fear death. To earn money, Mecom boiled soap and took in boarders, and in 1767 she and her daughters Jenny and Polly established a small shop to sell caps and bonnets that they created using materials sent from London by a friend of Benjamin Franklin. The shop failed when colonists boycotted imported products, a decision Benjamin Franklin could only encourage. It is to be noted that women could not earn money without the permission of their husbands, thus it can be believed that Jane's husband recognized the need for his wife to work, as they were not financially stable and he could not provide for them on his own. (Had he been able to Jane would have been considered a "feme covert", a woman taken care of by a man.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brouffard|first=James Charles|title=The Entrepreneurial Ben Franklin, 2nd ed.|year=2007|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=95sX14sTM_IC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one of Mecom's children outlived her. Edward Mecom died in 1765 after 38 years of marriage.&lt;ref name=almanac&gt;{{cite news|last=Lepore|first=Jill |title=Poor Jane’s Almanac|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/opinion/24lepore.html|accessdate=July 15, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Jane Mecom and Benjamin Franklin corresponded for six decades following his departure from their childhood home, letters written by Mecom before 1758 are lost. Prior to that date, the only record of her writing is a slim book that she made to chronicle her life. Mecom named her chronicle "Book of Ages."&lt;ref name=almanac/&gt;

When Benjamin Franklin died in 1790, his will stipulated that Mecom should continue to live in her house, which was owned by Franklin, until she died. He also arranged for an allowance of 50 pounds to be given to her each year, a sizable sum at the time. Jane died four years later in 1794 at 82, survived by her only remaining child, Jane Mecom. The house was later demolished to make room for a memorial to Paul Revere.&lt;ref name=almanac/&gt;

[[Image:Janusz Palikot Sejm 05.JPG|thumb|Janusz Palikot interwieved in the Sejm]]
'''Janusz Marian Palikot''' ({{IPAc-pl|'|j|a|n|u|sz|-|p|a|'|l|i|k|o|t}}, born 26 October 1964 in [[Biłgoraj]]) is a [[Poland|Polish]] politician, activist and businessman. Palikot studied philosophy and became wealthy as a businessman who dealt with crates and distilled beverages (dealt with international trade with tax havens in the Polish privatization period). He was elected to [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]] on 25 September 2005 in the [[Lublin (parliamentary constituency)|6 Lublin district]], running on the [[Civic Platform]] list, and was re-elected in 2007.

Palikot left Civic Platform in 2011 and founded Movement of Support, later renamed [[Palikot's Movement]], an [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] and liberal party, which won 10 percent of the vote in the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2011|2011 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref name = "NYT 10-10-2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kulish|first=Nicholas|title=Provocateur's Strong Showing Is a Sign of a Changing Poland|newspaper=The New York Times|date=10 October 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/world/europe/polands-palikot-movement-signals-a-changing-society.html|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private life==
Palikot studied Philosophy at [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin]] and earned a master's degree at [[Warsaw University]]. He is an entrepreneur and former co-owner of Polmos Lublin S.A. (a vodka business) and Ambra S.A. He is divorced from his first wife, Maria Nowińska, with whom he has two sons, Emil and Aleksander; he has since married Monika Kubat, with whom he has a son, Franciszek, and a daughter, Zofia.

==Controversies and publicity==
Palikot is known in Poland for being one of the more colourful and controversial politicians, famous for his publicity stunts. In April 2007 during a PO press conference, Palikot wore a T-shirt with "I am with the [[Democratic Left Alliance|SLD]]" ("Jestem z SLD") on the front and "I am gay" ("Jestem gejem") on the back. He later stated that he wanted to highlight the role PO should play in contemporary politics – as defenders of minorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nt.interia.pl/newsroom/news/po-powinna-bronic-gejow-zydow-i-ludzi-z-s  ld,896113 ''PO should defend gays, Jews and members of the SLD'' – interia.pl]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April 2007, he produced a [[gun]] and a [[dildo]] at a press conference about alleged [[rape]] by a few police officers from [[Lublin]]. Palikot presented the objects as modern "symbols of law and justice" (a pun referring to the socially conservative [[Law and Justice]] Party) in Poland and the Lublin's police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fakty.interia.pl/newsroom/news/palikot-z-silikonowym-penisem-w-rece,901145 ''Palikot with a silicon penis in his hand'' – interia.pl]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 2008 Palikot said in an interview "I consider the President to be an oaf" ("Uważam prezydenta za chama"), a potentially illegal act under Poland's anti-defamation laws. An investigation was launched,&lt;ref name=defonet&gt;{{cite web|title=Palikot defamed the president? |url=http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/1793827,12,1,1,,item.html |publisher=Onet.pl |accessdate=6 April 2011 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; then dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Palikot didn't defame the president.|url=http://www.newsweek.pl/artykuly/sekcje/polska/palikot-nie-bedzie-scigany-za-chama,36387,1|publisher=Newsweek.pl|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008 during a TV interview about the [[PZPN]] (Polish Football Association) Palikot produced a butchered pig's head, a [[Godfather Trilogy|Godfather]]-style sign of declaring war against what Palikot called "corrupt" PZPN officials.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvn24.pl/12690,1567885,0,1,palikot-podklada-swinie-listkiewiczowi-doslownie,wiadomosc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009 Palikot caused further controversy when he wrote in his blog questioning whether the Polish President's brother, [[Jarosław Kaczyński]], is gay: "I – unasked – declare unequivocally that I prefer women. And you, Mr Jarosław?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/Archive/09/Jan/1102.htm ''Polish Politician to Former Polish Prime Minister: Are You Gay?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202160831/http://ukgaynews.org.uk/Archive/09/Jan/1102.htm |date=2009-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Donald Tusk]], the leader of Palikot's party, the Civic Platform, launched an investigation into his behaviour.

On 5 July 2010, one day after the second round of the [[Polish presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential elections]] Palikot announced that the late president [[Lech Kaczyński]] "has blood on his hands", blaming Kaczyński for [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|the presidential airplane crash]] in Smolensk.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvn24.pl/-1,1663632,0,1,lech-kaczynski-ma-krew-na-rekach,wiadomosc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 January 2012, Janusz Palikot threatened to smoke a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]] in Parliament in an attempt to get softdrugs legalized in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h5IbBCNBrq1qjXZ4LKuaY0he30Wg?docId=709849a3364d413eb269f4e0bd474efc "Polish politician tries to smoke pot in parliament."] Associated Press. Retrieved 20th of January, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In April 2009, National Prosecutor's office announced that it would look carefully into financing of the 2005 electoral campaign of Janusz Palikot. At that time, he managed to collect 856,000 [[zloty]]s, but, according to the prosecutor's office, among sponsors of his campaign were students and pensioners, who handed over to his campaign office the sums reaching up to 20,000; the money they otherwise could never afford. Dariusz Piatek of local office of the Civic Platform in Lublin stated afterwards that Palikot's campaign was "illegally financed", but the case was never highlighted due to Palikot's influences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.se.pl/wydarzenia/kraj/prokurator-zajmie-sie-palikotem_95341.html Prokurator zajmie się Palikotem, Super Express, 16.04.2009]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In summer of 2011, authorities of [[Central Anticorruption Bureau]] announced that Palikot was suspected of tampering with his property statements in the years 2005–2010. Palikot allegedly reported lower wealth than he actually possessed, by millions of zlotys. His ex-wife supported the Bureau's efforts, stating that the politician provided false information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.se.pl/wydarzenia/kraj/maria-nowinska-wreszcie-wzieli-sie-za-palikota_195704.html Maria Nowińska – BYŁA ŻONA Janusza Palikota: Najwyższa pora, żeby Januszek poniósł karę, Super Express, 14.07.2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In an investigation, which was initiated by Maria Nowinska, prosecutor's office asked the government of The [[Netherlands Antilles]] for help, as Palikot is suspected of transferring part of his money to that country, which is a [[tax haven]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.se.pl/wydarzenia/kraj/palikot-wywiozl-fortune-do-podatkowego-raju_213340.html PALIKOT wywiózł FORTUNĘ do podatkowego raju?, Super Express, 09.11.2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, internet portal www.niezalezna.pl wrote that Palikot owes large sums of money to different companies, institutions and people. Among others, he owes 40,000 zlotys to a private contractor, Andrzej Kwapis, who renovated his office, but was never paid for the work. Palikot did not pay the money to a company that maintained his webpage, nor did he pay Piotr Tymochowicz, a public relations specialist, who helped with creating his image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://niezalezna.pl/18322-palikot-klamca-i-oszust "Palikot to kłamca i oszust", 2011-10-31]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, Electoral Committee of Palikot Movement lost a court case against Pawel Tanajna, who had stated in [[Wprost]] weekly, that Palikot and his party act "like a mafia", paying people who service them only "50 percent or nothing". Justice Tomasz Wojciechowski said that refusing to pay bills was not "accidental, but rather a frequent practice". Wojciechowski emphasized that Palikot had planned "to gull people who trusted him", citing an e-mail, written by Palikot to chairwoman of his office, in which he mentioned "building the capital at the expense of suppliers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://wolnapolska.pl/index.php/Polska/2011110814843/tajemnice-pienidzy-palikota/menu-id-247.html Tajemnice pieniędzy Palikota by Robert Wit Wyrostkiewicz]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Michał Majewski and Wojciech Cieśla of [[Dziennik Polska-Europa-Świat]] daily established that Palikot had received millions of zlotys in loans from anonymous companies, established in different tax havens. The politician owed back then 2 million euros to a company called Central European Private Investments (CEPI), which had belonged to him. CEPI had been founded by him in March 2007, with capital of 100,000 euros, but in the following months, Palikot borrowed from it 2 million euros. CEPI itself used to borrow money from a company called Decleora, whose address was a mail box in [[Limassol]], [[Cyprus]]. It is not known where Decleora's money came from, because Cyprus law allows to hide information about financial transactions of companies registered there. When asked about Decleora, Janusz Palikot stated that he did not know who owned the company from Cyprus. Michał Majewski and Wojciech Cieśla further established that Decleora's shares had been owned by New Age Private Foundation from [[Curacao]], whose address was the same as the address of JP Family Foundation – a company, through which Palikot had allegedly transferred money out of Poland in 2004. Furthermore, all mentioned companies were serviced by ATC, a managing company from [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/polityka/artykuly/90206,tajemnica-wielkich-pieniedzy-posla-palikota.html Tajemnica wielkich pieniędzy posła Palikota, 2009-05-29]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Andrew Boehner''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|n|ər}} {{respell|BAY|nər}};&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; born {{nowrap|November 17}}, 1949) is an American politician who served as the [[List of Speakers of the United States House of Representatives|53rd]] [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] from 2011 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/01/05/pelosi.boehner/index.html | work=CNN | title=Boehner takes charge as new Congress convenes | date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he was the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|OH|8}} from 1991 to 2015. The district included several rural and suburban areas near [[Cincinnati]] and [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]].

Boehner previously served as the [[Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] from 2007 until 2011, and [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] from 2006 until 2007. Boehner's almost nine years as the Republican Leader in the House (four years as Minority Leader and nearly five years as Speaker) was the longest consecutive tenure for a Republican Leader in the House since [[Robert H. Michel|Bob Michel]] of Illinois served 14 years as House Minority Leader between 1981 and 1995. Boehner resigned from the House of Representatives in October 2015 due to opposition from within the Republican caucus.

In September 2016, [[Squire Patton Boggs]], the third largest lobbying firm in the U.S., announced that Boehner would join their firm. It was also announced that Boehner would become a board member of [[Reynolds American]], the second biggest tobacco firm in the U.S., for an estimated annual salary of $400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/20/john-boehner-squire-patton-boggs/ |title=John Boehner Joins Squire Patton Boggs, Law Firm Known for Lobbying |publisher=Fortune.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life, education, and career ==
Boehner was born in [[Reading, Ohio]], the son of Mary Anne (née Hall; 1926–1998) and Earl Henry Boehner (1925–1990), the second of twelve children.

Shortly after his graduation in 1977, Boehner accepted a position with Nucite Sales, a small sales business in the packaging and [[plastics industry]]. He was steadily promoted and eventually became president of the firm, resigning in 1990 when he was elected to Congress.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

== Early political career ==
From 1981 to 1984, Boehner served on the board of trustees of [[Union Township, Butler County, Ohio]]. He then served as an [[Ohio House of Representatives|Ohio state representative]] from 1985 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/9538 Boehner, John Andrew].

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
[[File:Representative John Boehner in 1993 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Boehner in 1993]]
In 1990, Boehner ran against incumbent Congressman [[Buz Lukens]], who was under fire for having a sexual relationship with a minor. In a three-way Republican primary that included Boehner, Lukens, and former Congressman [[Tom Kindness]], Boehner won with 49 percent of the vote.&lt;ref name="talberta"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alberta|first1=Tim|title=John Boehner Unchained|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/29/john-boehner-trump-house-republican-party-retirement-profile-feature-215741|accessdate=30 October 2017|publisher=Politio|date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then handily beat his Democratic opponent, [[Greg Jolivette]], in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1990|November election]].  He was subsequently re-elected to Congress 12 times, each by a substantial margin.

=== Gang of Seven and ''Contract with America'' ===
During his freshman year, Boehner was a member of the [[Gang of Seven]] which was involved in bringing media attention to the [[House banking scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/us/politics/05boehner.html A Rabble-Rouser, Then and Now], New York Times, Carl Hulse, July 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The group also [[Congressional Post Office scandal|investigated]] the Congressional Post Office, leading to the indictment of Congressman [[Dan Rostenkowski]].&lt;ref name="talberta"/&gt; Later, he, along with [[Newt Gingrich]] and several other Republican lawmakers, was one of the engineers of the ''[[Contract with America]]'' in 1994 that politically helped Republicans during the [[United States elections, 1994|1994 congressional elections]] during which they won the majority in Congress for the first time in four decades.

From 1995 to 1999, Boehner served as [[Republican Conference Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference Chairman]], making him fourth-ranking House Republican behind Gingrich, [[House Majority Leader|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] and [[House Majority Whip|Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]].&lt;ref name="talberta"/&gt; During his time as Conference Chairman, Boehner championed the [[Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996|Freedom to Farm Act]] that, among other provisions, revised and simplified direct payment programs for crops and eliminated milk price supports through direct government purchases.

In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]]'s public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted "coup" began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman Boehner and Republican leadership chairman [[Bill Paxon]] of New York. According to their plan, [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]], [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]], Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/07/21/time/gingrich.html |publisher=CNN|title=Attempted Republican Coup: Ready, Aim, Misfire|accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats—along with dissenting Republicans—would vote in [[Dick Gephardt]] as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly. Paxon was the only unelected member of the leadership group, having been appointed to his position by Gingrich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lessons Learned the Hard Way |last=Gingrich |first=Newt |year=1998 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019106-1 |pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Republicans lost seats in the [[United States elections, 1998|1998 elections]], the House Republican leadership underwent a reorganization. Armey and DeLay kept their positions, but Gingrich was replaced by [[Dennis Hastert]], and Boehner lost his position as conference chairman to [[J.C. Watts]].&lt;ref name="talberta"/&gt;

=== Chairman of Committee on Education and Labor ===

Following the election of President [[George W. Bush]], Boehner was elected as chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Education and the Workforce Committee]], serving from 2001 until 2006. There he authored several reforms including the [[Pension Protection Act of 2006|Pension Protection Act]] and a successful school choice voucher program for low-income children in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=George F.

=== House Republican Leader ===
[[File:John Boehner portrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|2006 portrait of Boehner]]

Delay resigned as Majority Leader in 2005 after being indicted, and Boehner, House Majority Whip [[Roy Blunt]] of [[Missouri]], and Representative [[John Shadegg]] of [[Arizona]], all sought to succeed Delay.&lt;ref name="talberta"/&gt; Boehner campaigned as a reform candidate who wanted to reform the so-called "[[Earmark (politics)|earmark]]" process and rein in government spending. In the second round of voting by the House Republican Conference, Boehner defeated Blunt with 122 to 109 votes. Blunt kept his previous position as Majority Whip, the No. 3 leadership position in the House. (There was some confusion on the first ballot for Majority Leader as the first count showed one more vote cast than Republicans present,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/12015-1.html |title=Roll Call |accessdate=2006-02-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204102043/http://rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/12015-1.html |archivedate=February 4, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to a misunderstanding as to whether the rules allowed Resident Commissioner [[Luis Fortuño]] of Puerto Rico to vote).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/02/lol.01.html |title=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=February 2, 2006 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Republicans lost control of the House in the 2006 elections, the House Republican Conference chose Boehner as Minority Leader.  While as Majority Leader he was second-in-command behind Speaker Dennis Hastert, as Minority Leader he was the leader of the House Republicans. As such, he was the Republican nominee for Speaker in 2006 and 2008, losing both times to Pelosi.

According to the 2008 Congress.org Power Ranking, Boehner was the 6th most powerful congressman (preceded by Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Ways and Means Committee Chairman [[Sander M. Levin]], Dean of the House [[John Dingell]], and Appropriations Committee Chairman [[Dave Obey]], all Democrats) and the most powerful Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/overall.tt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918155340/http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/overall.tt |archivedate=September 18, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Minority Leader, Boehner served as an ''ex officio'' member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]].

The Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, with a net gain of 63 seats.

Boehner appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' on January 23, 2014. When asked by [[Jay Leno|Leno]] if he would ever run for president, the Speaker said no, adding, "I like to play golf.

On September 25, 2015, Boehner announced that he would step down as Speaker and resign from Congress at the end of October 2015. Boehner's resignation took place after [[Pope Francis]]' [[Pope Francis' visit to the United States|address to Congress the day before]], an event considered by Boehner personally as the highest point in his legislative career. Sources in his office indicated he was stepping aside in the face of increasing discord while trying to manage passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government.  Conservative opposition to funding [[Planned Parenthood]] as part of the resolution, and stronger threats to Boehner's leadership on account of the controversy, prompted the abrupt announcement.&lt;ref name="resign1"&gt;{{cite news|title=John Boehner Will Resign From Congress|first=Jennifer |last=Steinhauer |work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/us/boehner-will-resign-from-congress.html|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, House Majority Leader [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] of California had announced he would run for Speaker and was seen as the prohibitive favorite. On October 8, 2015, McCarthy abruptly announced he would not run for Speaker, citing that he felt he could not effectively lead a fractured Republican Caucus.

== Controversies ==
{{criticism section|date=June 2015}}

=== Connections to lobbyists ===
In June 1995, Boehner distributed campaign contributions from [[tobacco industry]] [[lobbyist]]s on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dana Milbank |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/02/AR2006020202571_pf.html |title=Boehner Makes His Political Comeback |work=Washington Post |date=February 3, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 documentary by [[PBS]] called ''The People and the Power Game'', Boehner said "They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before we got to the end of the month and I complied. And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a practice that's gone on here for a long time that we're trying to stop and I know I'll never do it again."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

A September 2010 ''[[New York Times]]'' story said Boehner was "Tightly Bound to Lobbyists" and "He maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggest businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R.J.

In November 2010, Boehner, along with Minority Whip Eric Cantor, called for the cancellation of an exhibit in the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] after he learned that it featured a video by [[David Wojnarowicz]], ''A Fire in My Belly'', that contained an image of a [[crucifix]] with ants crawling on it.

=== Hurricane Sandy relief bill ===
On January 1, 2013, after passing the [[fiscal cliff]] [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|deal]], Boehner adjourned the House without passing the $60 million [[Hurricane Sandy relief bill]].

According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'': "From [[illegal immigration]] to sanctions on China to an overhaul of the pension system, Boehner, as chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, took ardently pro-business positions that were contrary to those of many in his party.

On May 25, 2006, Boehner issued a statement defending his agenda and attacking his "[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] friends" such as Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]]. Boehner said regarding national security that voters "have a choice between a Republican Party that understands the stakes and is dedicated to victory, and a Democrat Party with a non-existent national security policy that sheepishly dismisses the challenges of a post-[[9/11]] world and is all too willing to concede defeat on the battlefield in [[Iraq]]."

Boehner is a signer of [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge|Americans for Tax Reform]]'s [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge]].&lt;ref name="ATR"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers 112th Congressional List|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/091411-federalpledgesigners.pdf|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Boehner labeled former NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]] a traitor after his [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|leaks]] went public.&lt;ref name=20130611sfchron&gt;{{cite news |title=John Boehner: Edward Snowden Is A 'Traitor' |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=June 11, 2013 |last= LoGiurato |first= Brett |url= http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/JOHN-BOEHNER-Edward-Snowden-Is-A-Traitor-4593261.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I'm not qualified to debate the science over [[climate change]]," Boehner said at a press conference on May 29, 2014 at which he criticized proposed federal regulations on [[Fossil-fuel power station|coal-fired power plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boehner 'not qualified' to debate climate change |first=Russell |last=Berman |url=http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/207580-boehner-not-qualified-to-debate-climate-change |publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=May 29, 2014 |accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Boehner: I'm 'not qualified' to debate climate change |date=May 29, 2014 |first=Aliyah |last=Frumin |url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/boehner-not-qualified-debate-climate-change |accessdate=March 20, 2015 |publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Republicans Keep Telling Everyone They're Not Scientists|first=Coral|last=Davenport|date=October 30, 2014|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=March 20, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/why-republicans-keep-telling-everyone-theyre-not-scientists.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Boehner opposed the NATO-led [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention in Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/06/22/war.powers.libya/ Boehner: House not with McCain on Libya campaign]".

=== Financial crisis ===
On September 18, 2008, Congressman Boehner attended a closed meeting with congressional leaders, then-Treasury Secretary [[Henry Paulson]] and [[Chair of the Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve Chairman]] [[Ben Bernanke]], and was urged to craft legislation to help financially troubled banks. That same day (trade effective the next day), Congressman Boehner cashed out of an equity mutual fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/lawmakers-inside-advantage-trading "Lawmakers' inside advantage to trading"] ''Marketplace.''

[[File:President Obama &amp; John Boehner debt ceiling negotions. JPG.JPG|thumb|left|Speaker Boehner meets with President Obama at the White House during the 2011 debt ceiling increase negotiations]]
On October 3, 2008 Boehner voted in favor of the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP),&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll681.xml Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008] Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives. October 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; believing that [[Article One of the United States Constitution|the enumerated powers]] grant Congress the authority to "purchase assets and equity from financial institutions in order to strengthen its financial sector."

Boehner has been highly critical of several initiatives by the Democratic Congress and President [[Barack Obama]], including the "[[cap and trade]]" plan that Boehner says would hurt job growth in his congressional district and elsewhere. He opposed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] and said that, if Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections, they would do whatever it takes to stop the act. One option would be to defund the administrative aspect of the Act, not paying "one dime" to pay the salaries of the workers who would administer the plan.&lt;ref name="Wereschagin" /&gt; He also led an opposition to the 2009 stimulus and to Obama's first budget proposal, promoting instead an alternative economic recovery plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://republicanleader.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=109659 |title=House GOP Economic Recovery Alternative Will Create 6.2 Million New American Jobs &amp;#124; Republican Leader John Boehner |publisher=Republicanleader.house.gov |accessdate=June 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608232152/http://republicanleader.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=109659 |archivedate=June 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Republican budget (authored by Ranking Rep.

Boehner favors making changes in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], such as by raising the retirement age to 70 for people who have at least 20 years until retirement, as well as tying cost-of-living increases to the [[consumer price index]] rather than [[inflation|wage inflation]], and limiting payments to those who need them.&lt;ref name="Wereschagin"&gt;{{Citation| last = Wereschagin| first = Mike| last2 = Zito| first2 = Salena| title = Obama's good for GOP, Boehner says| newspaper = [[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]| date = June 29, 2010| url = http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_688102.html| accessdate = September 12, 2010| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100702154122/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_688102.html| archivedate = July 2, 2010| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Boehner called the [[No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act]] "one of our highest legislative priorities."&lt;ref&gt;Somashekhar, Sandhya.

In 2013, Boehner led his caucus in a strategy to hold Defense spending hostage in order to avoid reducing the deficit with revenue increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2013/02/04/republicans-target-their-own-voters-in-defense-budget-switch/ |title=Republicans Target Their Own Voters In Defense Budget Switch |publisher=Forbes |date=January 18, 2012 |accessdate=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boehner was opposed by Democratic nominee [[Justin Coussoule]], [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] nominee Jim Condit, and [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] nominee David Harlow; but won the 2010 election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/upload/elections/2010/gen/usrep.pdf Official candidate list] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614222218/http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/upload/elections/2010/gen/usrep.pdf |date=June 14, 2011 }}, Ohio Secretary of State&lt;/ref&gt;

As Republican House Leader, Boehner was a Democratic target for criticism of Republican views and political positions. In July 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] began singling out Boehner for criticism during his speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Yunji de Nies and Sunlen Miller (July 30, 2010) [http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/06/target-gop-obama-takes-aim-at-boehner-barton-.html] ABC News&lt;/ref&gt; In one speech, Obama mentioned Boehner's name nine times&lt;ref&gt;Toby Harnden (September 17, 2010) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8009943/John-Boehner-the-second-of-12-kids-from-Ohio-who-is-Barack-Obamas-elitist-target.html John Boehner: the second of 12 kids from Ohio who is Barack Obama's elitist target] The Daily Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt; and accused him of believing that police, firefighters, and teachers were jobs "not worth saving."&lt;ref&gt;Frank James (September 12, 2010) [https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/09/08/129732461/obama-take-on-boehner-by-name-shades-of-clinton-gingrich Obama Takes Boehner On By Name; Shades Of Clinton-Gingrich] NPR&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-speakership ==

=== Politics ===
Boehner made headlines in April 2016 when he referred to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Ted Cruz]] as "[[Lucifer]] in the flesh" in an interview at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Kristina|title=John Boehner Calls Ted Cruz 'Lucifer in the Flesh'|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/04/28/john-boehner-calls-ted-cruz-lucifer-in-the-flesh/|accessdate=28 April 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 12, after [[Donald Trump]] became the presumptive Republican nominee, Boehner's support for him became public, though he distanced himself on several policies and expressed satisfaction with Cruz not securing the nomination: "Thank God the guy from Texas didn't win."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/politics/john-boehner-backs-donald-trump/|date=May 12, 2016|publisher=CNN|title=John Boehner backs Donald Trump, thanks God Cruz didn't win|first=Phil|last=Mattingly}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 23, 2017, Boehner predicted Republicans would "fix" the Affordable Care Act and give it a different name as opposed to their stated intent to repeal and replace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/23/politics/john-boehner-obamacare/|title=Boehner: Obamacare repeal and replace 'not what's going to happen'|date=February 24, 2017|publisher=CNN|first=Terence|last=Burlij}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business ===

Boehner joined the board of tobacco company [[Reynolds American]] on September 15, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Egan |first=Matt |url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/15/investing/john-boehner-smoking-joins-tobacco-company/ |title=Heavy smoker John Boehner joins tobacco company's board - Sep. 15, 2016 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2016-09-15 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, John Boehner announced his joining the board of Acreage Holdings, a [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] corporation, to "promote the use of [[Medical cannabis in the United States|medical marijuana]]" and to advocate for federal [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|decriminalization]] of it, a shift in his previously adamant opposition to [[cannabis in the United States|cannabis]] legalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gstalter|first1=Morgan|title=Boehner joins cannabis company board to push for medical use|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/382614-boehner-joins-board-of-cannabis-company-for-push-for-medical|website=The Hill|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In reporting his pending retirement, [[Politico]] summarized his Speakership:
:Boehner came into power on the momentum of the 2010 tea party wave. But it was that movement that gave him constant problems. He clashed with [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] over the debt limit, government funding, Obamacare and taxes. But his tenure will also be remembered for his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama. He and Obama tried — but repeatedly failed — to cut a deal on a sweeping fiscal agreement. But Boehner has had some significant victories, including the trade deal that Congress passed this year, and changes to entitlement programs.&lt;ref&gt;Jake Sherman, Anna Palmer, John Bresnahan and Lauren French, "Speaker John Boehner retiring from Congress at the end of October" [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/speaker-john-boehner-retiring-from-congress-at-the-end-of-october-214056#ixzz3mlVEHpBf ''POLITICO'' Sept. 25, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Kane in the ''Washington Post'' emphasizes how none of the "big deals" he sought were ever reached:
:Boehner never landed the really big deal he craved. Not the $4 trillion tax-and-entitlement deal he reached for in 2011, not the repackaged version a year later and not the immigration overhaul he sought in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kane, "After nearly five years, Boehner could never land the 'big deal' he wanted" [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/after-nearly-five-years-boehner-could-never-land-the-big-deal-he-wanted/2015/09/25/6bf22bd2-63b3-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html ''Washington Post'' Sept 25, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Kane argues,  Boehner's persona alienated conservative Republicans who demanded more vigorous attacks on Obama and instead perceived, "a country club Republican who loved to play 18 holes of golf and drink merlot afterward while cutting deals. In an era of shouting and confrontation, on talk radio or cable TV, Boehner's easygoing style did not fit."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kane, "After nearly five years, Boehner could never land the 'big deal' he wanted"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Boehner and his wife Debbie were married in 1973, and live in the [[Wetherington, Ohio|Wetherington]] section of [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|West Chester Township]]. They have two daughters, Lindsay and Tricia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=James Rowley |date=October 28, 2010 |title=Boehner's Blue-Collar Roots Frame Possible Next Speaker's Views |journal=Business Week |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |location=New York, NY |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-10-28/boehner-s-blue-collar-roots-frame-possible-next-speaker-s-views.html |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628225642/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-10-28/boehner-s-blue-collar-roots-frame-possible-next-speaker-s-views.html |archivedate=June 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Boehner and his wife bought a $835,000 condo in [[Marco Island, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.naplesnews.com/news/house-speaker-john-boehner-bringing-tan-tears-to-marco-island-after-buying-luxury-condo-ep-477587229-331048911.html |title=House Speaker John Boehner bringing tan, tears to Marco Island after buying luxury condo |date=February 20, 2014 |newspaper=[[Naples Daily News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Bender-produced films have received 36 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, resulting in eight wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.ucla.edu/people/lawrence-bender|title=Lawrence  Bender, UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability|website=www.environment.ucla.edu|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gala17&gt;{{cite web|url=https://losangelesballet.org/pdf/Gala_2017_Celebrities.pdf|title=Honoree Lawrence Bender}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former [[civil engineering|civil engineer]], Macri won the first presidential [[Two-round system|runoff]] [[Ballotage in Argentina|ballotage]] in Argentina's history (the runoff system had been introduced in 1994) and is the first democratically-elected non-[[Radical Civic Union|Radical]] or [[Justicialist Party|Peronist]] president since 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/article/mauricio-macri-el-primer-presidente-desde-1916-que-no-es-peronista-ni-radical|title=Mauricio Macri, el primer presidente desde 1916 que no es peronista ni radical|date=22 November 2015|publisher=Los Andes|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[List of mayors and chiefs of government of Buenos Aires|chief of government of Buenos Aires]] from 2007 to 2015, and represented [[Buenos Aires|the city]] in the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|lower house]] of the [[National Congress of Argentina|Congress of Argentina]] from 2005 to 2007. The reintegration of Argentina into the international community is central to Macri's agenda.

Born in Tandil, [[Buenos Aires Province]], Macri is the son of [[Francesco Macri]], a prominent [[Italian people|Italian]] businessman in the industrial and construction sectors, and was raised in an [[upper class]] home. He received a [[bachelor's degree]] in civil engineering from the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina]] and studied at [[Columbia Business School]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qué estudiaron y a qué universidades fueron los candidatos a Presidente|url=http://www.girabsas.com/nota/13864/|accessdate=7 October 2015|work=Girabsas|date=7 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012013732/http://www.girabsas.com/nota/13864/|archivedate=12 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macri became president of [[Boca Juniors]], one of Argentina's two most popular football clubs, in 1995. In 2005, he created the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] [[Republican Proposal]] party (Propuesta Republicana, also known as PRO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los momentos de Mauricio Macri en Boca que marcaron su perfil político |url=http://www.infobae.com/2015/11/23/1771739-los-momentos-mauricio-macri-boca-que-marcaron-su-perfil-politico|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=Girabsas|date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Macri was a potential presidential candidate in the [[Argentine general election, 2011|2011 general elections]], he ran instead for reelection as mayor. He received about 47 percent of the vote in the mayoral election, which led to a [[Two-round system|runoff]] election on 31 July 2011 against [[Daniel Filmus]] in which Macri was reelected for a second consecutive term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=El jefe de gobierno fue reelecto por amplio margen|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1393853-macri-y-filmus-se-enfrentan-una-eleccion-con-alto-impacto-a-nivel-nacional|website=www.lanacion.com.ar|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 November 2015, after a tie in the first round of the [[Argentine general election, 2015|presidential elections on 25 October]], he received 51.34 percent of the vote to defeat [[Front for Victory]] candidate [[Daniel Scioli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Balotaje: terminó el escrutinio definitivo y Macri ganó por una menor ventaja |url=http://www.minutouno.com/notas/1456464-balotaje-termino-el-escrutinio-definitivo-y-macri-gano-una-menor-ventaja|accessdate=10 December 2015|work=minutouno|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was inaugurated on 10 December 2015 in the Argentine Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Así juró Macri en el Congreso|url=http://tn.com.ar/politica/asi-juro-macri-en-el-congreso_641107|accessdate=10 December 2015|work=Todo Noticias|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Macri was named one of the [[Time 100|world's 100 most influential people]] and the most powerful president in [[Latin America]] by the U.S. news magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/collection/2016-time-100/|publisher=time.com|title=List of individuals included in the ''TIME'' 100 in 2016 |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Time" incluyó a Macri entre las 100 personas más influyentes del mundo|url=http://tn.com.ar/politica/time-incluyo-macri-entre-las-100-personas-mas-influyentes-del-mundo_667489|accessdate=21 April 2016|work=Todo Noticias|date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Macri was born in [[Tandil]] in the province of Buenos Aires, the son of Italian-born tycoon [[Francisco Macri|Fracisco "Franco" Macri]] (owner of the [[Philco]] affiliate in Argentina) and Alicia Blanco-Villegas Cinque.&lt;ref name="Villegas"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1947637-quien-es-alicia-blanco-villegas-la-madre-de-mauricio-macri|title= ¿Quién es Alicia Blanco Villegas, la madre de Mauricio Macri?|trans-title= Who is Alicia Blanco-Villegas, the mother of Mauricio Macri?|language= Spanish|author= |date= 16 October 2016|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to Buenos Aires a short time later, and kept their houses in Tandil as [[Holiday cottage|vacation properties]].&lt;ref name="Villegas" /&gt;&lt;!-- Was there more than one house in Tandil? --&gt; His father, and his uncle Jorge Blanco Villegas, influenced Macri to become a businessman, and Franco expected his son to succeed him as leader of his firms. Macri preferred his uncle's company to constant scrutiny by his father. He was educated at [[Colegio Cardenal Newman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1849283-los-amigos-de-macri-del-cardenal-newman-y-la-empresa-al-poder "Los amigos de Macri: del Cardenal Newman y la empresa, al poder", ''La Nacion'', 27 November 2015.] (Retrieved 17 June 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and received a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina]] (UCA). At this time Macri became interested in [[neoliberalism]] and joined the now-defunct [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Argentina)|Union of the Democratic Centre]] and a [[think tank]] led by former minister [[Álvaro Alsogaray]].&lt;ref&gt;''Todo Macri'', pp. 8-10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, he briefly attended [[Columbia Business School]], the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[Universidad del CEMA]] in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;[http://www.cema.edu.ar/cgc/download/2004/cvmacri.pdf Mauricio Macri's curriculum vitae], CEMA; accessed 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Macri's professional experience began at SIDECO Americana, a construction company which was part of his father's Socma Group [[holding company]], where he worked for three years as a junior analyst and became a senior analyst. In 1984, he worked in the credit department of [[Citibank]] Argentina in Buenos Aires. Macri joined Socma Group the same year, and became its general manager in 1985. In 1992, he became vice president of [[Sevel Argentina]] (then manufacturing [[Fiat]] and [[Peugeot]] automobiles under licence in Argentina as part of Socma), and became president two years later.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

In 1991, Macri was kidnapped for 12 days by officers of the [[Policía Federal Argentina|Argentine Federal Police]]. Kept in a small room with a [[chemical toilet]] and a hole in the roof to receive food, he was freed when his family reportedly paid a multimillion-dollar ransom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/world/argentina-finds-a-kidnapping-ring-of-policemen.html|title=Argentina Finds a Kidnapping Ring of Policemen
|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macri has said that the ordeal led him to enter politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.newstalk.com/Kidnapped-former-football-club-who-is-Argentinas-new-president|title= Kidnapped by police and the former chief executive of a football club: who is Argentina's new president?|author= Adrian Collins|date= November 23, 2015|publisher= News Talk|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Rolling Stones with Macri 02.jpg|thumb|Macri and his wife Juliana and their daughter with [[The Rolling Stones]], February 2016]]
His first wife was Ivonne Bordeu, daughter of race-car driver [[Juan Manuel Bordeu]]. They had three sons: Agustina, Jimena and Francisco. After they divorced, Macri married model [[Isabel Menditeguy]] in 1994; Franco requested a [[prenuptial agreement]]. Although the marriage reached a crisis when Macri became chairman of Boca Juniors, they did not divorce until 2005. He began a romance with María Laura Groba which did not lead to marriage. Macri left Groba in 2010, began a relationship with businesswoman [[Juliana Awada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/bellas-mujeres-pareja-Mauricio-Macri_0_H1CxltvQx.html|title= Las bellas mujeres que fueron pareja de Mauricio Macri|trans-title= The nice women who were couples of Mauricio Macri|language= Spanish|author= |date= 22 November 2015|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and married Awada that year. At the wedding reception, he wore a fake moustache as part of his impersonation of singer [[Freddie Mercury]]. Macri accidentally swallowed the moustache, and Minister of Health [[Jorge Lemus]] performed [[first aid]] to save his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elintransigente.com/argentina/2010/11/22/macri-trago-bigote-vivieron-momentos-panico-casamiento-62061.html|title= Macri, se tragó el bigote y se vivieron momentos de pánico en su casamiento|trans-title= Macri, swallowed a mustache and lived moments of panic at his wedding|language= Spanish|author= |date= 22 November 2010|publisher= El Intransigente|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newsweek.com/who-mauricio-macri-argentinas-new-president-403465|title= Who is Mauricio Macri, Argentina’s New President?|author= Moore, Jack|publisher= Newsweek|date=11 December 2015|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boca Juniors==
Macri intended to run for chairman of Boca Juniors in 1991, but his father convinced him to keep working at Sevel. He tried to buy the [[Deportivo Español]] team, but could not get support from the team's board of directors. Macri supported [[Boca Juniors]], paying coach [[César Luis Menotti]]'s salary and buying players for the team (including [[forward (association football)|forward]] [[Walter Perazzo]]). Franco, skeptical about his son's prospects for success, finally allowed him to run Boca Juniors. He instructed aide [[Orlando Salvestrini]] to work with Mauricio for two reasons: to help him and to monitor his activities. Mauricio met with former Boca Juniors chairmen [[Antonio Alegre]] and [[Carlos Heller]], and tried to convince them to work with him; both rebuffed him. Macri later sought the support of other groups in Boca Juniors, eventually winning the team's internal elections in 1995 with 7058 votes.&lt;ref&gt;''Todo Macri'', pp. 29-33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.clarin.com/deportes/dia-goles-primera-victoria-macri_0_SyMg_YktDQx.html|title= El día de los 10 goles y la primera victoria de Macri|trans-title= The day of the 10 goals and the first victory of Macri|language= Spanish|author= Guillermo Dos Santos Coelho|date= December 3, 2015|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first years were unsuccessful; the team's performance was poor, players frequently complained about salaries and bonuses, and Macri changed coaches three times. The only initial improvement was a partial reconstruction of the stadium. He arranged that the Boca Juniors institution worked in the [[stock exchange]], to earn enough money to buy new players. Macri's first coach was [[Carlos Salvador Bilardo]], who brought 14 new players to the team and finished the [[1996–97 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Apertura|1996 Apertura league]] in 10th place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ole.com.ar/boca-juniors/futbol/Boca-trajo-jugadores-salio-mitad_0_1303669672.html|title= En el 96 Boca trajo 15 jugadores y salió en la mitad|trans-title= In the '96 Boca brought 15 players and ended in the middle|language= Spanish|author= "En el 96 Boca trajo 15 jugadores y salió en la mitad"|date= 14 February 2015|publisher= Olé|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second coach, [[Héctor Veira]], also performed poorly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/111397-el-mejor-arranque-de-boca|title= El mejor arranque de Boca|trans-title= The best start of Boca|language= Spanish|first= Christian|last= Leblebidjian|date= 22 September 1998|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New coach [[Carlos Bianchi]] helped [[Juan Román Riquelme]] improve his performance, and had [[Martín Palermo]] and [[Guillermo Barros Schelotto]] as effective forwards. They won the first two tournaments, beginning a record 40-match unbeaten run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://tn.com.ar/deportes/esencial/cuanto-quedo-el-river-de-gallardo-del-record-invicto-del-boca-de-bianchi_902446|title= ¿A cuánto quedó el River de Gallardo del invicto del Boca de Bianchi?|trans-title= How far is River from the unbeaten's run of Bianchi's Boca?|language= Spanish|author= |date= October 3, 2018|publisher= TN|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
[[File:Mauricio Macri Foto de Prensa.jpg|thumb|alt=A smiling Macri in a light-blue shirt|Macri in 2007]]
Macri made his political debut in 2003, founding the centre-right party [[Commitment to Change]] ({{lang-es|Compromiso para el Cambio}}).&lt;ref name="confrontational"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ft.com/content/62219644-5807-11e6-9f70-badea1b336d4|title= Interview: Argentine president Mauricio Macri looks to end confrontational politics|author= Benedict Mander|date= September 9, 2016|publisher= Financial Times|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was intended to be a source of new politicians, since the major parties were discredited after the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/opinion/pro-cambiemos-macri-presidente-partidos-politicos_0_BkTdleFvXg.html|title= Macri y el PRO en el poder: una suma de novedades históricas|trans-title= Macri and the PRO in power: a sum of historical novelties|language= Spanish|author= Fabián Bosoer|date= November 23, 2015|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Macri ran for mayor of Buenos Aires, alongside [[Horacio Rodríguez Larreta]]. Although he won the first round of the election with 37 percent of the vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/522038-macri-le-gana-a-ibarra-y-hay-ballottage|title= Macri le gana a Ibarra y hay ballottage|trans-title= Macri defeats Ibarra and there is ballotage|language= Spanish|author= |date= 25 August 2003|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he lost the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] with 46 percent of the vote to the sitting mayor [[Aníbal Ibarra]], who was re-elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1393937-macri-establecion-una-nueva-marca-en-la-ciudad|title= Macri estableció un nuevo récord en la ciudad|trans-title= Macri set a new score in the city|language= Spanish|author= |date= 1 August 2011|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Macri joined [[Ricardo López Murphy]] of [[Recreate for Growth|Recrear]] in a political coalition, the [[Republican Proposal]] (PRO), and was elected to the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] with 33.9 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terra.com.ar/canales/elecciones2005/124/124688.html|title=Macri's profile|publisher=Terra.com.ar |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His campaigns were managed by [[Jaime Durán Barba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=El gurú de Macri y De Narváez reparte consejos a los políticos|url=hhttps://www.clarin.com/ediciones-anteriores/guru-macri-narvaez-reparte-consejos-politicos_0_BkOFhKATYg.html|website=clarin|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2007 report, Macri had participated in only 44 of 321 votings; he countered that he had become disappointed with Congress, since bills sent by the president were not open to debate or amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/885633-polemica-por-una-lista-de-ausencias-en-diputados|title= Polémica por una lista de ausencias en Diputados|trans-title= Controversy over a list of absences in the chamber of deputees|language= Spanish|first= Laura|last= Serra|date= 22 February 2007|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibarra was impeached and removed from office in 2006 as a result of the [[República Cromañón nightclub fire]], and his term was completed by vice-chief of government [[Jorge Telerman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/786946-la-legislatura-destituyo-a-ibarra|title= La Legislatura destituyó a Ibarra|trans-title= The legislature removed Ibarra|language= Spanish|first= Angeles|last= Castro|date= 8 March 2006|publisher= La Nacion|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2006, Macri worked both on his political activities as deputy and with his presidency of Boca Juniors. Before the [[Elections in Argentina, 2007|2007 national elections]], he negotiated with the likely presidential candidate [[Jorge Sobisch]], the [[governor of Neuquén Province]], to create a national right-wing political coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/687829-alianza-de-macri-y-sobisch-para-2007|title= Alianza de Macri y Sobisch para 2007|trans-title= Alliance of Macri and Sobisch for 2007|language= Spanish|author= Oliver Galak|date= March 16, 2005|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conflicted with Macri's alliance with Ricardo López Murphy, who also intended to run for president and had denounced Sobisch for corruption. Later that year, Sobisch's image was severely tarnished when teacher Carlos Fuentealba was killed during a union demonstration in [[Neuquén, Argentina|Neuquén]]. Macri immediately backed out of his pact with Sobisch and remained neutral during the national election,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/897913-macri-volvio-a-tomar-distancia-del-gobernador-jorge-sobisch|title=Macri volvió a tomar distancia del gobernador Jorge Sobisch |trans-title=Macri distanced himself again from governor Jorge Sobisch|language=Spanish|publisher=La Nacion |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was won by [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] of the [[Front for Victory]] (FPV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/29/argentina.rorycarroll|title=Argentina elects first woman president|first=Fred|last=Attewill|date=29 October 2007|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007 Macri announced that he would run again for mayor of Buenos Aires, heading the PRO slate with [[Gabriela Michetti]]. In the 2 June 2007 first round, he received 45.6 percent of the vote and defeated government-backed [[Daniel Filmus]] (who received 23.8 percent of the vote); incumbent Jorge Telerman finished third. In the 24 June 2007 runoff election, Macri defeated Filmus with 60.96 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 25 June 2007. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6222126.stm Profile: Mauricio Macri].&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Argentine legislative election, 2009|2009 midterm elections]], he allied with [[Francisco de Narváez]] and [[Felipe Solá]]. The alliance was successful; De Narvaez defeated the former president [[Néstor Kirchner]] in Buenos Aires Province and Gabriela Michetti won the city election. With this defeat, the Kirchners lost the majority of both chambers of the Congress that they had. Cristina Kirchner, whose public image was good after the [[death and state funeral of Néstor Kirchner]] in late 2010, ran for reelection. Macri, who was considered a likely candidate for the opposition, ran for reelection as mayor instead. He won the first round on 10 July 2011 with 47.08 percent of the vote against Filmus' 27.78 percent, and then the 31 July runoff against Filmus with 64.25 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1393937-macri-establecio-un-nuevo-record-en-la-ciudad%7CMacri|title= Macri estableció un nuevo récord en la ciudad|trans-title= Macri set a new high score in the city|language= Spanish|author= |date= 1 August 2011|publisher= La Naciòn|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buenos Aires administration==

===Public transport===

Macri's administration worked on public transport in an attempt to reduce auto traffic in Buenos Aires. One project was the [[Metrobus (Buenos Aires)|Metrobus]], a [[bus rapid transit]] system added to the city's main streets. By the end of Macri's term as mayor, the {{convert|50.5|km|mi|adj=on}} system had five lines and 113 stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barrett|first1=Chris|title=For Argentine Environmentalists, New President Macri Elicits Hope — and Skepticism|url=http://latindispatch.com/2015/12/10/for-argentine-environmentalists-new-president-macri-elicits-hope-and-skepticism/|accessdate=11 December 2015|work=Latin America News Dispatch|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other streets have bikeways to promote cycling, and the city created its [[EcoBici (Buenos Aires)|EcoBici]] bicycle-sharing scheme. By the end of Macri's administration, about {{convert|155|km|mi|abbr=on}} of bicycle lanes were constructed and 49 of the planned 200 automated bicycle-sharing stations were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecobici|url=http://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/ecobici|publisher=Buenos Aires Ciudad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several level crossings on the [[Rail transport in Argentina#Buenos Aires|city's commuter-rail network]] were replaced by tunnels to improve road and rail traffic flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tomino|first1=Pablo|title=Harán otros seis pasos bajo nivel en la ciudad, que serán estrenados en 2015|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1678988-haran-otros-seis-pasos-bajo-nivel-en-la-ciudad-que-seran-estrenados-en-2015|accessdate=11 December 2015|work=La Nacion|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Macri, the city committed to two large rail-infrastructure projects: running viaducts through the center of the city to extend the [[Belgrano Sur Line]], and raising the [[San Martín Line]] to eliminate level crossings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Castro|first1=Ángeles|title=Eliminarán 20 pasos a nivel de las líneas San Martín y Belgrano Sur|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1753016-eliminaran-20-pasos-a-nivel-de-las-lineas-san-martin-y-belgrano-sur|accessdate=11 December 2015|work=La Nacion|date=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macri proposed the [[Red de Expresos Regionales]] project to link the city's main railway terminals and lines with a series of tunnels; but as of 2018, in the term of [[Horacio Rodríguez Larreta]], the project is still in the planning stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2116466-red-de-expresos-regionales-rer-como-es-la-obra-que-hoy-presenta-horacio-rodriguez-larreta|title= Red de Expresos Regionales (RER): cómo es la obra que presentó el Gobierno|trans-title= Red de Expresos Regionales (RER): this is the project presented by the government|language= Spanish|author= |date= March 13, 2018|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Buenos Aires Underground]], initially maintained by the national government, was the subject of a year-long dispute between Macri and Kirchner. The national government sought to transfer it to the city, which Macri supported, but the budget and length of the transition period were contested. Macri announced that the city would take over the underground on 13&amp;nbsp;November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tn.com.ar/politica/traspaso-del-subte-un-ano-de-idas-y-venidas_286891|title= Traspaso del subte: un año de idas y vueltas|trans-title= Transfer of the underground: a year of comes and goes|language= Spanish|author= |date= 13 November 2012|publisher= TN|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Line A (Buenos Aires Underground)|Line A]], still using [[La Brugeoise cars (Buenos Aires Underground)|wooden cars almost a century old]], received a fleet of modern cars from the national government; [[Line H (Buenos Aires Underground)|Line H]] also received new cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preadjudican 105 coches a CNR para la línea A|url=http://enelsubte.com/noticias/preadjudican-105-coches-cnr-la-linea-2641/|accessdate=24 November 2015|work=EnElSubte|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Línea H: abrirán dos estaciones más antes de fin de año|url=https://www.perfil.com/noticias/sociedad/Linea-H-abriran-dos-estaciones-mas-antes-de-fin-de-ano-20151003-0032.phtml|accessdate=11 December 2015|work=Perfil|date=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madrid Metro]] rolling-stock purchases for [[Line B (Buenos Aires Underground)|Line B]] were criticised, despite their technical superiority, for having a limited compatibility with the line and costing more than [[CSR EMU (Argentina)|new trains for the city's commuter-rail network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bochorno: los trenes usados de la B ya costaron más que comprar 0 km|url=http://enelsubte.com/noticias/bochorno-los-trenes-usados-de-la-b-ya-costaron-mas-que-comprar-0-km/|accessdate=11 December 2015|work=EnElSubte|date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolitan police===
[[File:Macri cadetes de la PM de la CABA.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright=0.9|alt=Macri, in an overcoat, walks down a line of young police officers|Macri inspecting [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police|Metropolitan Police]] graduates]]
The main police force in the city at the time was the national police, the [[Argentine Federal Police]]. Buenos Aires, initially a [[federal district]] with limited autonomy, became an [[autonomous city]] with the [[1994 amendment of the Constitution of Argentina]]. The Federal Police, under national-government jurisdiction, still worked in the city and disputes over a potential transfer to a local force were unresolved when Macri was elected.
He unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a transfer with President Cristina Kirchner. As an alternative, in 2008 Macri proposed a bill for the creation of the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police]] to work with federal police in the city. The bill, supported by the [[Republican Proposal]] (PRO) party and the Kirchnerite blocs, was rejected by [[Civic Coalition]] blocs and those aligned with [[Aníbal Ibarra]]. [[Elisa Carrió]], leader of the Civic Coalition, thought that Macri had abandoned the transfer request, and Ibarra said that the forces' duties would overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/ediciones-anteriores/crearon-policia-metropolitana-calle-fines-2009_0_SyEG5qiApFx.html|title= Crearon la Policía Metropolitana y estaría en la calle a fines de 2009|trans-title= The new metropolitan police was created, and it will be in the streets by the ending of 2009|language= Spanish|first= Daniel|last= Gutman|date= 29 October 2008|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Metropolitan Police began with nearly 1,000 officers; the Federal Police had 17,000 officers working in the city. As a result, the metropolitan police worked on a small scale during the transition and more complex tasks were reserved for the federal police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/ediciones-anteriores/nueva-policia-podra-efectuar-desalojos-controlar-marchas_0_By2PqiR6Kx.html|title= La nueva Policía podrá efectuar desalojos y controlar marchas|trans-title= The new police will be able to control house usurpations and street protests|language= Spanish|first= Daniel|last= Gutman|date= 30 October 2008|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jorge Alberto Palacios]] was the first chief of the Metropolitan Police. Part of the police unit which rescued Macri from his kidnappers, Palacios was fired by Néstor Kirchner for his alleged involvement in the [[murder of Axel Blumberg]] (for which he was acquitted). His appointment was controversial; Palacios had been investigated for concealing evidence of the 1994 [[AMIA bombing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jta.org/2009/07/08/news-opinion/world/new-top-cop-in-buenos-aires-in-amia-probe|title= New top cop in Buenos Aires in AMIA probe|first= Florencia|last= Arbiser|date= 8 July 2009|publisher= Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he resigned a short time later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3767660,00.html|title= Investigator of Argentinean Jewish center attack resigns|author= |date= |publisher= Ynet|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of police protection to the city was completed during the administration of Macri's successor, [[Horacio Rodríguez Larreta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/222564/larreta-to-announce-new-city-police|title= Larreta to announce new City police|author= |date= 5 October 2016|publisher= Buenos Aires Herald|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex marriage===
[[File:Mauricio Macri asistió a la misa anual por la educación (7091688691).jpg|thumb|alt=Macri shaking hands with Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio (now Pope Francis)|Macri and Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio (now [[Pope Francis]])]]
A gay couple, José María Di Bello and Alex Freyre, wanted to get married in Buenos Aires, which was not legal by then, and so they started a judicial case. According to Di Bello and Freyre, articles 172 and 188 of the civil code, which restrict marriage to people of different genders, was unconstitutional. Judge Gabriela Seijas agreed, and they married in 2009. It was the first [[same-sex marriage in Argentina]]. Macri did not appeal the ruling, saying that same-sex marriage was becoming universally accepted and individuals had a right to happiness. He compared the controversy with the sanctioning of [[divorce]] during the 1980s after the restoration of democracy in Argentina; highly controversial at first, it was eventually accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/ediciones-anteriores/macri-dio-fuerte-respaldo-matrimonio-homosexuales_0_HJNgYfdC6Kx.html|title= Macri dio un fuerte respaldo al matrimonio entre homosexuales|trans-title= Macri gave a strong support to same-sex marriage|language= Spanish|first= Mariana|last= Iglesias|date= 14 November 2009|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|federal law]] permitting same-sex marriage was passed the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/world/americas/16argentina.html|title= Argentina Approves Gay Marriage, in a First for Region|first= Alexei|last= Barrionuevo|date= 15 July 2010|publisher= The New York Times|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macri's refusal to appeal the sentence affected his relationship with [[archbishop of Buenos Aires|Archbishop]] Jorge Bergoglio (who later became [[Pope Francis]]). Bergoglio opposed same-sex marriage, and expected Macri to appeal the ruling. According to the archbishop, it was not up to a lower-court judge to rule on the constitutionality of a law and Macri should have appealed the ruling in a higher court. Bergoglio was also annoyed by what he considered a lack of communication between him and Macri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1203956-tensa-reunion-entre-bergoglio-y-macri-por-el-matrimonio-gay|title= Tensa reunión entre Bergoglio y Macri por el matrimonio gay|trans-title= Tense meeting between Bergoglio and Macri over same-sex marriage|language= Spanish|first= Ángeles|last= Castro|date= 25 November 2009|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential elections==

[[File:Macri-Presidente.png|thumb|left|upright=.91|alt=Logo reading "Macri Presidente", with a multicolored horizontal bar|Macri's 2015 presidential campaign logo]]
Macri ran for president of Argentina in [[Argentine general election, 2015|2015]]. With President Cristina Kirchner unable to run, early opinion polls indicated a close three-way race between Macri, [[Kirchnerism|Kirchnerite]] governor [[Daniel Scioli]] and [[Tigre, Buenos Aires|Tigre]] mayor [[Sergio Massa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lapoliticaonline.com/nota/85201/|title= Las últimas encuestas confirman que sigue el triple empate entre Massa y Macri y Scioli|trans-title= The last polls confirm the triple draw between Massa, Macri and Scioli|language= Spanish|date=22 November 2014|publisher= La Política Online|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other minor parties, such as the [[Radical Civic Union]] (UCR), the [[Civic Coalition]] (CC) and some socialist parties, made a political coalition, the [[Broad Front UNEN]]. This coalition disbanded before the elections, and the UCR and CC made instead a coalition with the PRO, named [[Cambiemos]] ({{lang-es|Let's change}}). Macri supported [[Horacio Rodríguez Larreta]] against Gabriela Michetti in the PRO primary elections for mayor of Buenos Aires. Larreta won the primary and general elections, and Michetti was selected as the vice-presidential candidate. [[María Eugenia Vidal]], deputy mayor of Macri, was running for [[governor of Buenos Aires Province]] in the Cambiemos ticket. The populous province was a strategic district for the election. Macri and Massa negotiated a coalition against Kirchnerism, with Massa stepping down from the run to the presidency and running for governor of Buenos Aires instead, in the same ticket of Macri. Macri declined this proposal, kept [[María Eugenia Vidal]] as governor candidate, and Massa ran for president with his own party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1847774-macri-el-gladiador-del-cambio-que-suena-con-vencer-al-kirchnerismo|title=Macri: el gladiador del cambio que sueña con vencer al kirchnerismo|trans-title=Macri: the gladiator of change who dreams of defeating kirchnerism|language=Spanish|first=Jaime|last=Rosemberg|date=22 November 2015|work=La Nación|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macri, Carrió and [[Ernesto Sanz]] ran in the primary elections, which Macri won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resultados.gob.ar/web/dat99/DPR99999A.htm |title=Total nacional |language=Spanish |publisher=Elecciones argentinas |accessdate=1 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831055814/http://www.resultados.gob.ar/web/dat99/DPR99999A.htm |archivedate=31 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preelection polls indicated that Scioli would win by a wide margin, possibly avoiding a [[Ballotage in Argentina|ballotage]]. The final results showed Scioli finishing first with 37.08 percent, just ahead of Macri's 34.15 percent, leading to a [[ballotage in Argentina|ballotage]] round on 22 November. Massa finished third with 21 percent of the vote, and the other two candidates contended for his voters. Scioli and Macri were polarized about the presidency of Cristina Kirchner; Scioli wanted to keep most Kirchnerite policies, and Macri wanted to change them. In the legislative elections, the [[Front for Victory]] (FPV) lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies but kept it in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/argentinas-presidential-election-headed-for-second-round-after-no-clear-winner|title= Argentina's presidential election headed for second round after no clear winner|author= Jonathan Watts and Uki Goñi|date= 26 October 2015|publisher= The Guardian|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Rodríguez Machado y Macri de campaña en Córdoba.jpg|thumb|upright|Macri campaigning in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Cordoba]], in August 2015]]
Scioli did not participate in the first [[Presidential debates in Argentina|presidential debate]] before the elections, and it was held with the other five candidates. When the ballotage was confirmed, Macri agreed to a presidential debate with Scioli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1840173-argentina-debate-acelera-la-organizacion-del-debate-scioli-macri-no-tenemos-mucho-tiempo|title= Argentina Debate acelera la organización del debate Scioli-Macri: "No tenemos mucho tiempo"|trans-title= Argentina debate speeds up the organization of the Scioli-Macri debate: "We don't have enough time"|language= Spanish|author= |date= 27 October 2015|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two debates were planned: one by the Argentina Debate NGO and another by TV news channel [[Todo Noticias]]. Macri preferred a single debate, and opted for the one organized by Argentina Debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1840725-mauricio-macri-se-bajo-del-debate-organizado-por-el-canal-tn|title= Mauricio Macri se bajó del debate organizado por el canal TN|trans-title= Mauricio Macri stepped down from the debate organized by the channel TN|language= Spanish|author= |date= 28 October 2015|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He criticized Scioli for [[negative campaigning]] by the Front for Victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1841866-macri-hablo-de-una-estrategia-oscura-pero-se-centrara-en-sus-propuestas-de-gestion|title= Macri habló de una "estrategia oscura", pero se centrará en sus propuestas de gestión|trans-title= Macri talked about a "dark strategy", but will focus on his proposals|language= Spanish|first= Jaime|last= Rosemberg|date= 2 November 2015|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several politicians and FPV institutions issued warnings about what might happen if Macri were elected president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1842152-extienden-a-todas-las-areas-del-estado-la-campana-contra-macri-columnista-3x1-28-ropube-demin|title= Extienden a todas las áreas del Estado la campaña contra Macri|trans-title= They expand to all state areas the campaign against Macri|language= Spanish|first= Francisco|last= Olivera|date= 3 November 2015|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scioli, the campaign was intended to encourage public awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/politica/agravios-intmididaciones-campana_sucia-balotaje_0_1460853908.html|title= Con agravios e intimidaciones, comenzó una campaña sucia hacia el balotaje|trans-title= The dirty campaign towards the ballotage started with defamations and threats|language= Spanish|first= Alejandro|last= Alfie|date= 3 November 2015|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rumored that the campaign might have been suggested by Brazilian [[João Santana]], who organized a similar campaign in Brazil during the [[Two-round system|ballotage]] of [[Dilma Rousseff]] and [[Aécio Neves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1841865-santana-el-experto-en-el-centro-de-los-rumores|title= Santana, el experto en el centro de los rumores|trans-title= Santana, the expert in the middle of rumors|language= Spanish|author= |date= 2 November 2015|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballotage was held on 22 November. Scioli conceded with 70 percent of the votes counted and provisional results of 53 and 47 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/22/americas/argentina-elections/index.html|title= Argentina elections: Daniel Scioli concedes defeat|author= Catherine E.

Macri took office on 10 December. He left his apartment in the [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]] neighbourhood (at the corner of [[Avenida del Libertador]] and Cavia) at 11:00&amp;nbsp;am, walking to the [[National Congress of Argentina]] with wife [[Juliana Awada]] and four-year-old daughter via the Casa Rosada and the [[Plaza de Mayo]]. At 11:41 he entered the legislative chamber, taking the oath of office after Vice President [[Gabriela Michetti]]. Macri delivered a 27-minute speech pledging "support for an independent judiciary, to fight corruption and drug trafficking, the internal union of Argentina, universal social protection, a 21st-century style of education and for everyone to have a roof, water and sewer" and greeted his electoral rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Las 20 frases del discurso de Macri durante la asunción como presidente|url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/frases-discurso-Macri-asuncion-presidente_0_1483052017.html|work=Clarin|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later went to the [[Casa Rosada]] and received the presidential sash in the White Hall from Senate President Federico Pinedo, accompanied by Vice President [[Gabriela Michetti]], Chamber of Deputies President Emilio Monzó and Supreme Court President [[Ricardo Lorenzetti]]. Minutes later Macri went to the balcony where thousands of people waited in the [[Plaza de Mayo]], and said: "Argentines deserve to live better, and we are about to start a wonderful period for our country. I promise to always tell the truth and show where our problems are".

=== Economic policy ===

Macri began his presidency with economic difficulties carried over from previous governments. The [[Central Bank of Argentina]]'s [[bank reserves|reserves]] were depleted; inflation was over 30 percent, although the widely discredited [[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina]] (INDEC) provided a lower figure. The country had the highest fiscal pressure in history, &lt;!-- What is "fiscal pressure"? --&gt; but the [[government budget balance]] had an eight-percent deficit. There had been a [[sovereign default]] since 2001, and a conflict existed with [[hedge fund]]s; tight [[Argentine currency controls (2011–15)|currency controls]] had been in place since 2011. Since Argentina is a [[developing country]], a global drop in commodity prices reduced trade revenue.&lt;ref name="hopes"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ft.com/content/e4476904-beb6-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2|title= Macri raises hopes for Argentina’s economic renewal|author= Benedict Mander and Daniel Politi|date= 20 January 2016|publisher= Financial Times|accessdate=18 February 2017|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Macri's first economic policies was the removal of currency controls, allowing Argentines to freely buy and sell foreign currencies.

Macri wanted to negotiate with the holdouts and end the default to return to the international capital markets and strengthen the national economy.&lt;ref name="FT_DealHoldouts"/&gt; Argentina offered to pay $6.5&amp;nbsp;billion to settle lawsuits on 5 February 2016, requesting that the prior ruling on its payments be lifted.&lt;ref name="NYT_dealbook_2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/business/dealbook/hedge-funds-dealt-setback-as-us-sides-with-argentina.html?ref=world | title=Hedge Funds Dealt Setback as U.S. Sides With Argentina on Defaulted Bonds | publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' | date=24 March 2016 | accessdate=25 March 2016 | author=Stevenson, Alexandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal would still need to be ratified by the Argentine Congress.&lt;ref name="FT_DealHoldouts"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/02/29/argentina-reaches-4-65bn-deal-with-holdouts/|title=Argentina reaches $4.65bn deal with holdouts|date=29 February 2016|work=Financial Times|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Cambiemos]] did not have a majority in either house of Congress, the bill was approved in March and Argentina faced a court hearing in New York on 13 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1c1f696c-f6fc-11e5-9afe-dd2472ea263d.html#axzz44U7q7YSm|title=Argentina clears way for repayment of ‘holdout’ creditors|first=Benedict|last=Mander|date=31 March 2016|work=Financial Times|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court upheld judge [[Thomas P.

On 19 January 2016, Macri attended the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]] with opposition figure [[Sergio Massa]] and part of his cabinet in a search for investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-macri-davos-idUSKCN0UW1ZO|title= Argentina's Macri will attend Davos forum despite cracked rib|first= Hugh|last= Bronstein|date= 18 January 2016|publisher= Reuters|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the best-known figures at the meeting, along with Canadian prime minister [[Justin Trudeau]] and US vice president [[Joe Biden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/business/dealbook/trudeau-macri-and-biden-are-among-the-big-names-at-davos.html|title= Trudeau, Macri and Biden Are Among the Big Names at Davos|author= Michael J. de la Merced|date= 19 January 2016|publisher= The New York Times|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time Argentina had participated in the forum since 2003, and the last president to attend was [[Eduardo Duhalde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.mercopress.com/2016/01/07/macri-will-become-first-argentine-president-to-attend-davos-forum-in-twelve-years|title= Macri will become first Argentine president to attend Davos forum in twelve years|author= |date= 7 January 2016|publisher= Merco Press|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Macri's first year, the economy at large did not recover at the pace expected. Unemployment and inflation remained high and growth did not come as expected.&lt;ref name="change"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://time.com/4540098/argentina-mauricio-macri-challenge-of-change/|title= Argentina's Mauricio Macri on the Challenge of Change|first= Ian|last= Bremmer|date= 21 October 2016|publisher= Time|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirchner's [[Careful Pricing]] price-control program, which benefited [[small and medium-sized enterprises]], was kept with a revision of its included products. The government began several public-works projects to stimulate the economy and help the construction sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://panampost.com/raquel-garcia/2017/01/05/macri-maintains-kirchner-era-price-controls-argentina/|title= Macri Maintains Kirchner Era Price Controls in Argentina|first= Raquel|last= García|date= 5 January 2017|publisher= Panam Post|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political intervention in the INDEC figures ended, and the [[International Monetary Fund]] declared in November 2016 that Argentine statistics were again in accordance with international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://panampost.com/raquel-garcia/2016/11/10/imf-deems-argentinas-statistics-credible-again/ |title= IMF Deems Argentina’s Statistics Credible Again|first= Raquel|last= García|date= 10 November 2016|publisher= Panam Post|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) estimated that Argentina would emerge from recession in 2017 or 2018, and lowered its [[country risk]] classification from seven points to six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://panampost.com/raquel-garcia/2016/11/29/argentinas-economy-to-pull-out-of-recession-over-next-two-years/|title= Argentina’s Economy to Pull Out of Recession over Next Two Years|first= Raquel|last= García|date= 29 November 2016|publisher= Panam Post|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macri intends to increase trade with the United States, Europe and East Asia to aid national growth&lt;ref name="change" /&gt; and increase Argentina's [[digital economy]].&lt;ref name="change" /&gt; He planned to eliminate the country's 35-percent tariff on computer, laptop and tablet imports, which makes them three times more expensive in Argentina than in the US and 50% more expensive than in neighbouring Chile, in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.mercopress.com/2017/02/21/argentina-in-april-will-lower-35-tariff-on-computers-and-laptops-imports|title= Argentina in April will lower 35% tariff on computers and laptops imports|author= |date= 21 February 2017|publisher= Merco Press|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy policy===
[[File:Macri firma acuerdo Vaca Muerta 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Macri speaking to an audience from a podium|Macri announcing an investment deal for the Vaca Muerta shale deposit in Patagonia]]
Prices for [[Public utility|public utilities]] such as electricity, gas and water were fixed in 2002 by Eduardo Duhalde during the [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression]]. The Kirchners kept them fixed, and the state [[Subsidy|subsidized]] them to compensate for inflation, which rose by nearly 700% during their government.&lt;ref name="confrontational"/&gt; Investment in the sectors decreased, and their generation and distribution networks suffered. Argentina lost its self-sufficiency in energy, and had to import it instead of exporting its surplus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ft.com/content/f91f8318-ae42-11e0-8752-00144feabdc0|title= Argentina restricts foreign trade|first= Jude|last= Webber|date= 14 July 2011|publisher= Financial Times|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of energy imports increased the trade deficit and the inflation rate, and [[power outage]]s became frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.mercopress.com/2013/12/27/blackouts-continue-in-argentina-while-government-keeps-threatening-power-distributors|title= Blackouts continue in Argentina while government keeps threatening power distributors|author= |date= 27 December 2013|publisher= Merco Press|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kirchners left the grid on the brink of collapse.&lt;ref name="defends"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-macri-energy-idUSKCN0ZP0WH|title= Argentina's Macri defends energy rate hikes after court injunction|first= Jorge|last= Otaola|date= 9 July 2016|publisher= Reuters|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kirchners’ lavish subsidies were also a big factor in the huge fiscal deficit that harmed the national economy.&lt;ref name="confrontational"/&gt; 

Minister [[Juan José Aranguren]] arranged the removal of state subsidies for electricity, gas and water, which caused a huge increase in prices for those utilities. The increases were met with protests in a number of cities by people with banners, bugles and noise-making ''[[cacerolazo]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.mercopress.com/2016/08/15/argentina-s-economy-a-battle-over-utility-bills-is-president-macri-s-first-big-crisis|title= Argentina's economy: a battle over utility bills is president Macri’s first big crisis|author= |date= 15 August 2016|publisher= Merco Press|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several courts annulled the price increase, since it had been enacted without a public hearing, as required by law. The Supreme Court upheld a temporary halt of the price increase for residential customers in September 2016, which was greeted with relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1938443-protestan-contra-el-tarifazo-a-metros-de-la-audiencia-publica-por-el-gas|title= Protestan contra el tarifazo a metros de la audiencia pública por el gas|trans-title= Protests against the tax increase at meters of the public audience for the gas distribution|language= Spanish|author= |date= 16 September 2016|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to increase energy production, Macri signed an investment deal for the [[Vaca Muerta]] shale deposit in [[Patagonia]]. Roughly the size of [[Belgium]], Vaca Muerta has the second-largest reserve of shale gas in the world. To finalise the deal, the unions negotiated flexibility in labour costs (the main drawback to industrial development in the area). The [[Neuquén Province]] government pledged to improve roads and general infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ft.com/content/031d1674-d74f-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e|title= Argentina strikes $15bn a year shale investment deal|first= Benedict|last= Mander|date= 10 January 2017|publisher= Financial Times|accessdate=18 February 2017|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social issues===
Macri is [[Anti-abortion movements|pro-life]]. In a 2014 ''[[La Nación]]'' interview, he said: "I am in favor of life; I don't think we need to open that debate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mauricio Macri, sobre la despenalización del aborto: "Estoy a favor de la vida; no creo que haga falta abrir ese debate"|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1741452-mauricio-macri-no-crei-nunca-en-el-modelo-no-me-hace-falta-gritar|publisher=La Nacion|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he said that he would abide by any law sanctioned by Congress regardless of his personal views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1847224-mauricio-macri-desautorizo-a-duran-barba-por-sus-dichos-sobre-el-papa-francisco-y-el-aborto|title=Mauricio Macri desautorizó a Durán Barba por sus dichos sobre el papa Francisco y el aborto|trans-title=Macri discharges Durán Barba for his words about abortion|language=Spanish|date=20 November 2015|work=La Nación|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December Macri met with members of the [[Toba people|Qom]] community and 30 other groups of indigenous peoples. The meeting was held at the Casa Rosada Bicentennial Museum, and the delegation was headed by Qom community leader [[Félix Díaz (cacique)|Félix Díaz]]. Macri said that the recognition of indigenous communities and support for indigenous peoples are policies of his government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1855018-mauricio-macri-recibio-a-felix-diaz-y-otros-lideres-de-pueblos-originarios|title=Mauricio Macri: "Vamos a trabajar juntos para atender las necesidades de los pueblos originarios"|author= |date= 17 December 2015|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===
[[File:Mauricio Macri &amp; Donald Trump at the White House 05.jpg|thumb|Mauricio Macri, US president [[Donald Trump]] and their respective first ladies, at the [[White House]] in the United States.]]
During Macri's presidency, Argentina's foreign relations have shifted substantially from those under Kirchner. He immediately proposed action against [[Nicolás Maduro]] in Venezuela for human-rights abuses and tried to remove the country from [[Mercosur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/23/argentina-president-elect-mauricio-macri-iran-venezuela|title= Argentina president-elect pledges radical policy changes in shift to right|author= Jonathan Watts and Uki Goñi|date= 22 November 2015|publisher= The Guardian|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift is part of a change in the Latin American [[pink tide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35060390|title= Latin America: The pink tide turns|first= Nick|last= Caistor|date= 11 December 2015|publisher= BBC|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other countries in the bloc also opposed Maduro's socialist government, and prevented Venezuela from taking the ''pro tempore'' presidency of Mercosur. The bloc seeks a trade and cooperation agreement with the [[European Union]] and closer ties with the [[Pacific Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.mercopress.com/2016/08/02/mercosur-in-a-state-of-disarray-venezuela-s-presidency-disavowed-by-argentina-brazil-and-paraguay|title= Mercosur in a state of disarray; Venezuela's presidency disavowed by Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay|author= |date= 2 August 2016|publisher= Merco Press|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macri agreed with Brazilian president [[Michel Temer]] to guarantee [[free trade]] between their countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.mercopress.com/2017/02/04/temer-and-macri-meet-next-week-to-make-mercosur-an-effective-free-trade-space|title= Temer and Macri meet next week to make Mercosur an effective free trade space|author= |date= 4 February 2017|publisher= Merco Press|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macri and Temer increased their interest in better trade relations with Mexico, the second-largest economy in Latin America, when the country became involved a diplomatic conflict with US president Donald Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-argentina-mexico-idUSKBN15M2BK|title= Brazil, Argentina push for closer trade with Mexico in Trump era|first= Alonso|last= Soto|date= 7 February 2017|publisher= Reuters|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macri also shifted Argentina's relations with the United States. [[Barack Obama]] praised him during a 2016 two-day visit: "I'm impressed because he has moved rapidly on so many of the reforms that he promised, to create more sustainable and inclusive economic growth, to reconnect Argentina with the global economy and the world community". Obama announced that the US would declassify its military and intelligence records of the 1970s ''[[Proceso de Reorganización Nacional]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-argentina-idUSKCN0WP0B3|title= Obama praises Argentina's 'man in a hurry' Macri for reforms|author= Jeff Mason and Richard Lough|date= 24 March 2016|publisher= Reuters|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Minister [[Susana Malcorra]] supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US presidential election]], which was won by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Donald Trump]]. Macri forged diplomatic relations with Trump, tightening control of immigration, limiting the entry of convicted criminals and facilitating the deportation of foreigners who commit crimes. Those limits have been compared with [[Executive Order 13767|Trump's border policies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/americas/argentinas-trump-like-immigration-order-rattles-south-america.html?_r=0|title= Argentina’s Trump-Like Immigration Order Rattles South America|author= Simón Romero and Daniel Politi|date= 4 February 2017|publisher= The New York Times|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macri maintains the Argentine claim in the [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute]]. However, he took a less-confrontational stance towards the United Kingdom and allowed more flights between Argentina and the islands. Although relations between Argentina and the UK have improved, the United Kingdom maintains its claim to the islands and refuses to negotiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/21/argentine-president-mentions-falklands-in-brief-chat-with-theres/|title= Argentine president mentions Falklands in brief chat with Theresa May|author= |date= 21 September 2016|publisher= The Telegraph|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Macri Putin audiencia enero 2018 1.jpg|thumb|Macri with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] in January 2018]]
Macri changed Argentina's position on [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East|conflicts in the Middle East]]. During Macri's first week in office he voided the [[memorandum of understanding between Argentina and Iran]] which would have established a joint investigation of the 1994 [[AMIA bombing]], a terrorist attack on a Jewish organization for which Argentina has blamed [[Hezbollah]] and Iran. The memorandum had been ruled unconstitutional by the judiciary, a ruling which was appealed during Kirchner's presidency. Macri withdrew the appeal, upholding the original ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.timesofisrael.com/new-argentina-government-voids-pact-with-iran-on-amia-bombing/|title= New Argentina government voids pact with Iran on AMIA bombing|author= JTA|date= 14 December 2015|publisher= Times of Israel|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He distanced himself from Iran and encouraged continued investigations of the AMIA bombing and the [[death of Alberto Nisman]], a prosecutor investigating the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jta.org/2017/01/18/news-opinion/world/honor-alberto-nismans-sacrifice-by-continuing-his-probe-of-iran|title= Honor Alberto Nisman’s sacrifice by continuing his probe of Iran|author= Gardner Lange and Toby Dershowitz|date= 18 January 2017|publisher= Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those cases and Nisman's probe of Kirchner have special importance for [[Argentina–Israel relations]], and ambassador Carlos Faustino García and Israeli diplomat Modi Efraim praised Macri for encouraging the investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.timesofisrael.com/knesset-remembers-argentine-prosecutor-amid-hopes-for-breakthrough-in-case/|title= Knesset remembers Argentine prosecutor Nisman amid hopes for breakthrough|first= Marissa|last= Newman|date= 18 January 2017|publisher= The Times of Israel|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, it was announced that Argentina would grant asylum to 3,000 [[refugees of the Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://panampost.com/amanda-blohm/2016/07/07/argentina-will-receive-3000-syrian-refugees/|title= Argentina Will Accept 3,000 Syrian Refugees|first= Amanda|last= Blohm|date= 7 July 2016|publisher= Panam Post|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Scandals}}Controversies==
==={{anchor|Spy scandal}}Wiretapping case===
Sergio Burstein was the leader of a group of people whose relatives died in the AMIA bombing. Macri was charged in a 2010 [[Buenos Aires wiretapping case|wiretapping case]], suspected of spying on Burstein and his brother-in-law Néstor Daniel Leonardo. Macri denied the charges. Judge [[Norberto Oyarbide]] indicted him, and Federal Chamber members Eduardo Farah, Eduardo Freiler and Jorge Ballestero confirmed the indictment. It was suspected at the time that Macri had organized a clandestine spy network with the aid of [[Jorge Alberto Palacios]] and Ciro James. The case was transferred to judge [[Sebastián Casanello]], who ordered further investigation. It was learned that Macri had little knowledge about Palacios' daily activities and his minister, Mariano Narodowski, appointed James. [[Francisco Macri]] admitted hiring private agencies to spy on Daniel Leonardo.&lt;ref name="camara"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1909053-la-camara-confirmo-el-cierre-de-la-causa-contra-macri-por-las-escuchas|title= La Cámara confirmó el cierre de la causa contra Macri por las escuchas|trans-title= The chamber confirmed the closure of the case against Macri about wiretapping|language= Spanish|author= Paz Rodríguez Niell|date= 15 June 2016|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Casanello dismissed the charges in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/world/americas/mauricio-macri-argentine-president-is-cleared-of-wiretapping-charges.html?_r=0|title= Mauricio Macri, Argentine President, Is Cleared of Wiretapping Charges|first= Jonathan|last= Gilbert|date= 29 December 2015|publisher= The New York Times|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo appealed the ruling; the dismissal was upheld several months later in federal court. Farah, Freiler and Ballestero voted for acquittal; others involved in the case, including Palacios, are still under investigation.&lt;ref name="camara" /&gt;

===Panama Papers===
In 2016 the [[Panama Papers]], 11.5&amp;nbsp;million documents with details about offshore entities owned by people from many countries, were leaked. Macri was listed as a director of Fleg Trading from 1998 to 2009. He did not declare his involvement in 2007 (when he became mayor) or in 2015, when he became president. Prosecutor Federico Delgado asked the judiciary to determine if Macri "maliciously failed to complete his tax declaration". Macri argued that he did not report his involvement because he was not a [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] and did not receive money from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/argentina-president-maurio-macri-fights-back-after-panama-papers-reveal-offshore-links|title= Argentina's president Mauricio Macri fights back after Panama Papers reveal offshore links|first= Jonathan|last= Watts|date= 8 April 2016|publisher= The Guardian|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was established by his father to run a failed Brazilian business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-argentina-idUSKCN0X1202|title= Argentina's Macri denies wrongdoing at 'Panama Papers' offshore firm|first= Sarah|last= Marsh|date= 4 April 2016|publisher= Reuters|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macri owns other foreign accounts with properly-disclosed transactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/04/04/secret-panamapapers-files-who-did-what/82599656/|title= Panama Papers: Who's accused of what|first= Kim|last= Hjelmgaard|date= 4 April 2016|publisher= USA Today|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said that he would file a judicial "declaration of certainty" to affirm his statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35991155|title= Panama Papers: Argentina President Macri to go before judge|author= |date= 8 April 2016|publisher= BBC|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar company, Kagemusha, was discovered several months later.

On 20 September 2017, the civil judge Andrés Fraga determined that in the company Fleg Trading Ltd, of the Bahamas, Mauricio Macri only accepted the position of director for which he was appointed to the sole and only effect of designating a replacement and resigning, and that in Kagemusha he did not even accept tacitly the position of director for which he was appointed by Francisco Macri. The ruling adds that neither of the two companies he was a shareholder, that he did not receive any dividends or profits, did not participate in the business decisions or in any business, nor was he the owner or co-owner of any current bank account of the companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2064793-la-justicia-despego-a-mauricio-macri-de-los-panama-papers|title= La Justicia despegó a Mauricio Macri de los Panamá Papers |website=[[La Nación]] |language=Spanish |access-date= 6 November 2017  |date= 20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detention of Milagro Sala===
[[Gerardo Morales (politician)|Gerardo Morales]] of the [[Radical Civic Union|UCR]] was elected governor of [[Jujuy Province]] in the 2015 elections. Although the UCR was part of Cambiemos about federal politics, it was allied with [[Sergio Massa]] in the province. Morales was the first non-Peronist governor in the province since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/ultimo-momento/historico-batacazo-gerardo-morales-jujuy_0_SJJxGEWKPQe.html|title= Histórico batacazo del radical Gerardo Morales en Jujuy|trans-title= History surprise of the radical Gerardo Morales in Jujuy|language= Spanish|author= |date= 25 October 2015|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opposed activist [[Milagro Sala]], accusing her of leading a government parallel to that of [[Eduardo Fellner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1797984-con-criticas-a-fellner-y-a-milagro-sala-gerardo-morales-lanzo-su-candidatura|title= Con críticas a Fellner y a Milagro Sala, Gerardo Morales lanzó su candidatura|trans-title= Criticizing Fellner and Milagro Sala, Gerardo Morales launched his candidacy|language= Spanish|first= Amalia|last= Eizayaga|date= 1 June 2015|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Morales, Sala led a violent and coercive group and children were forced to join her party to attend school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lagacetasalta.com.ar/nota/28950/politica/para-gerardo-morales-milagro-sala-una-suerte-delia-schoklender-juntos.html|title= Para Gerardo Morales, Milagro Sala es "una suerte de D'Elia y Schoklender juntos"|trans-title= For Gerardo Morales, Milagro Sala is like "some kind of mix of D'Elía and Schoklender"|language= Spanish|author= |date= 22 August 2015|publisher= La Gaceta de Salta|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was elected governor, Morales ordered all organizations to operate though banks instead of on a cash basis to retain their legal standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1861894-gerardo-morales-emplazo-por-decreto-a-la-tupac-amaru-despues-del-14-que-les-pague-milagro-sala|title= Gerardo Morales emplazó por decreto a la Tupac Amaru: "Después del 14, que les pague Milagro Sala"|trans-title= Gerardo Morales pressured by the Túpac Amaru: "After the 14th, let them be paid by Milagro Sala"|language= Spanish|author= |date= 13 January 2016|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sala began a protest in front of the government plaza, but most of her supporters accepted Morales' edict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1976113-milagro-sala-un-ano-presa-y-cercada-por-la-justicia|title= Milagro Sala: un año presa y cercada por la Justicia|trans-title= Milagro Sala: one year jailed and surrounded by the judiciary|language= Spanish|first= Rosario|last= Agostini|date= 16 January 2017|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutor Viviana Montiel asked local judge Raúl Gutiérrez to order Sala's arrest for causing a disturbance and encouraging crime.

After Sala's arrest, she was charged with embezzlement in connection with housing construction. Although her initial charges were dropped, she remained in jail on the later ones.

[[File:View over the Botanical Garden in Brussels.JPG|thumb|Skyline of the Northern Quarter with the [[Botanical Garden of Brussels]] in the foreground]]
[[File:4752brusselsNorth.jpg|thumb|The [[Brussels-North railway station]]]]

The '''Northern Quarter''' ({{lang-fr|Quartier Nord (Espace Nord)}}, {{lang-nl|Noordruimte}}) is the [[central business district]] of [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. Like [[La Défense]] in [[Paris]], the Docklands in London or the [[Zuidas]] in [[Amsterdam]], the Northern Quarter consists of a concentrated collection of high-rise buildings.

The Northern Quarter roughly covers the area between [[Brussels–Scheldt Maritime Canal|Willebroek Quay]], railways along the [[Brussels-North railway station]] and the north side of the [[small ring (Brussels)|small ring]]. The territory is thus split between the municipalities of [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]], [[Schaerbeek]] and the [[Brussels (municipality)|City of Brussels]].

The area is characterized by high-rise buildings, most around 100 m tall. Over half of the 20 [[tallest buildings in Belgium]] are located in the Northern Quarter. The area has around 1,200,000 m² (13,000,000 sq ft) of office space occupied by 40,000 workers. It has an additional 8000 residents.

==History==
The creation of the business district was controversial. The demolition of a built-up and occupied residential area around [[Brussels-North railway station]] was not universally appreciated. Over 15,000 residents were forced out. Shortly after the first rows of residences were demolished, an economic crisis struck, leaving a gaping hole of open space in the city. The area has since filled up with skyscrapers.

The first new towers were completed in the 1970s and include [[World Trade Center (Brussels)|World Trade Center]]. Now that the area is an established business district, more and more companies in addition to federal and regional administrations have offices in the area.

After a lull in building in the 1990s projects began again in the 2000s. The 137 m tall [[Rogier Tower]], finished in 2006, gave more character to the skyline. The [[Zenith Tower]] anchors the area on its northern end.

==Background and education==
Munga was born in [[Kangema]] in [[Central Province (Kenya)|Kenya's Central Province]] in 1943.  
He went to Gaichanjiru high school. He received an honorary Doctor of Philosophy degree from University of Nairobi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The rise and rise and Equity Bank's founder Peter Munga|url=https://www.sde.co.ke/article/2000216434/the-rise-and-rise-and-equity-bank-s-founder-peter-munga|website=SDE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1984, Munga founded Equity Building Society (EBS) in his hometown of [[Kangema]], in Kenya's central highlands. With about KSh5,000 (about US$100 at that time) as starting capital, he convinced the Kenya government to issue him a license.

In 1993, Munga, as chairman, working in collaboration with the chief executive officer of EBS, hired [[James Mwangi]], age 31, to wind up the insolvent organisation. EBS was losing KSh5 million (approximately US$60,000 then) annually and had accumulated total losses of KSh33 million (approximately US$380,000 then). Mwangi, as director of finance at EBS, began to institute changes, resulting in the slow, but steady turn-around of the society. Also in 1993, Munga resigned as an assistant secretary in Kenya's Ministry of Water.

On 31 August 2004, EBS became [[Equity Bank]] and two years later was listed on the [[Nairobi Stock Exchange]] (NSE). On 18 June 2009, the bank's stock cross listed on the [[Uganda Securities Exchange]] and started trading that day, under the symbol EBL. {{asof|November 2014}}, the bank group has subsidiaries in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and South Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1736">'''Richard Burbidge''' (2 March 1847 – 31 May 1917) was an [[England|English]] [[merchant]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Wiltshire]], educated at [[Devizes]] and [[Melksham]], and at the age of 13 was apprenticed to a provision merchant in [[Oxford Street, London]], afterwards starting in business as a provision merchant at the age of 19. Fourteen years later he became general superintendent of the Army and Navy Auxiliary Stores. In 1882 he was appointed general manager of Whiteley's, [[Westbourne Grove]], and in 1891 entered the service of [[Harrods]], Brompton Road, of which he was afterwards managing director. By 1916, he had increased its profits from £16,000 to over £200,000, and it had become one of the largest of the London stores. He also did a good deal to ensure shorter working hours for shop assistants.

Burbidge was the “private citizen” who anonymously presented about £30,000 to the fund for acquiring [[the Crystal Palace]] for the public in 1913. During [[World War I]], he was responsible for the building and fitting up of two hospitals in [[Belgium]], and was a member of many government committees, including the advisory committee of the Ministry of Munitions and the committee of inquiry into the Royal Aircraft workings, of which he was chairman.

He was created a [[baronet]] in 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29483 |date=22 February 1916 |page=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Burbidge baronets]]). He died in [[London]].

'''Robert Francis Kennedy''' (November 20, 1925 – June 6, 1968) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 64th [[United States Attorney General]] from January 1961 to September 1964, and as a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] from January 1965 until [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|his assassination]] in June 1968. Kennedy, like his brothers [[John F. Kennedy|John]] and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward]], was a prominent member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and has come to be viewed by some historians as an icon of [[modern American liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/935987185|title=Bobby Kennedy : the making of a liberal icon|last=Larry,|first=Tye,|isbn=9780812983500|location=New York|oclc=935987185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], the seventh child of [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]] and [[Rose Kennedy]]. After serving in the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]] as a [[seaman apprentice]] from 1944 to 1946, Kennedy returned to [[Harvard College|Harvard University]] and graduated in 1948. He received his law degree from the [[University of Virginia School of Law|University of Virginia]] and was admitted to the [[Massachusetts]] bar in 1951. He began his career as a lawyer at the [[Department of Justice|Justice Department]] but later resigned to manage his brother John's successful [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1952|campaign]] for the U.S. Senate in 1952. The following year, he worked as an assistant counsel to the Senate committee chaired by Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]. He gained national attention as the chief counsel of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management|Senate Labor Rackets Committee]] from 1957 to 1959, where he publicly challenged [[Teamsters]] President [[Jimmy Hoffa]] over the corrupt practices of the union and authored ''[[The Enemy Within (Kennedy book)|The Enemy Within]]'', a book about corruption in organized labor.

Kennedy resigned from the committee to conduct his brother's campaign in the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]]. He was appointed [[United States Attorney General]] after the successful election and served as the closest advisor to the President from 1961 to 1963. His tenure is best known for its advocacy for the [[civil rights movement]], the fight against [[organized crime]] and the [[American Mafia|Mafia]], and involvement in U.S. foreign policy related to Cuba. After his [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|brother's assassination]], he remained in office in the [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson Administration]] for several months. He left to run for the United States Senate from [[United States Senate election in New York, 1964|New York in 1964]] and defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Kenneth Keating]]. In office, Kennedy opposed racial discrimination and U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. He was an advocate for issues related to [[human rights]] and [[social justice]] and formed relationships with [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Cesar Chavez]].

In [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]], Kennedy became a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for the presidency by appealing to [[Poverty|poor]], [[African Americans|African American]], [[Latinos in the United States|Hispanic]], [[Catholic]] and [[Youth vote in the United States|young]] voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tcf.org/content/report/inclusive-populism-robert-f-kennedy/?session=1|title=The Inclusive Populism of Robert F. Kennedy|last=Kahlenberg|first=Richard|date=2018-03-16|work=The Century Foundation|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main challenger in the race was Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]]. Shortly after winning the [[Robert F. Kennedy presidential campaign, 1968#California, South Dakota, and New Jersey primaries|California primary]] around midnight on June 5, 1968, Kennedy was [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|mortally wounded]] when shot with a pistol by [[Sirhan Sirhan]], a 24-year-old Palestinian, allegedly in retaliation for his support of Israel following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. Kennedy died the following day. Sirhan was arrested, tried, and convicted, though Kennedy's assassination, [[John F.

==Early life==
Robert Francis Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925, in suburban [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], the seventh of nine children to businessman/politician [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]] and philanthropist/socialite [[Rose Kennedy|Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (2002) [1978] p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His older brothers were [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.]] and [[John F. Kennedy|John F. "Jack" Kennedy]], who was elected the 35th President of the United States in 1960. His younger brother was longtime United States Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. "Ted" Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (2002) [1978] pp. 13, 220, 371.&lt;/ref&gt; All four of his grandparents were children of Irish immigrants.&lt;ref name="JFKlibrary.org misc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/John+F.+Kennedy+Miscellaneous+Information.htm |title=John F.

His father was a wealthy businessman and a leading Irish figure in the Democratic Party. After he stepped down as ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1940, Joe Sr. focused his attention on his oldest son, Joseph Jr., expecting that he would enter politics and be elected president. He also urged the younger children to examine and discuss current events in order to propel them to public service.&lt;ref&gt;Hilty, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; After Joseph Jr. was killed during [[World War II]], the senior Kennedy's hopes fell on his second son, John, to become president. Joseph Sr. had the money and connections to play a central role in the family's political ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, David (2012).

Kennedy's older brother John was often bedridden by illness and, as a result, became a voracious reader. Although he made little effort to get to know his younger brother during his childhood, John would take him for walks&lt;ref name=Thomas37-40 /&gt; and regale him with the stories of heroes and adventures he had read.&lt;ref name=Hilty15-16&gt;{{cite book|title=Robert Kennedy: Brother Protector |first=James|last=Hilty|year=2000| publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1566397667|pages=15–16.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of their favorite authors was [[John Buchan]], who wrote ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'', which influenced both Robert and John.&lt;ref name=Thomas37-40 /&gt; John sometimes referred to Robert as "Black Robert" due to his prudishness and disposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=President of the Other America: Robert Kennedy and the Politics of Poverty|pages=9–10.|first=Edward R.|last=Schmitt|year=2011|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=978-1558499041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike his older brothers, Kennedy took to heart their mother Rose's agenda for everything to have "a purpose," which included visiting historic sites during family outings, visits to the church during morning walks, and games used to expand vocabulary and math skills.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He described his position in the family hierarchy by saying, "When you come from that far down, you have to struggle to survive."&lt;ref name=Smith33&gt;{{cite book|title=Bad Blood: Lyndon B.

In September 1927, the Kennedy family moved to the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] neighborhood of New York City, then two years later to suburban [[Bronxville, New York|Bronxville]]. During his childhood, Kennedy spent summers and early autumns&lt;ref name=Kennedy37&gt;{{cite book|title=True Compass: A Memoir|first=Edward M. |last=Kennedy|page=37.|year=2009|isbn=978-0446539258|publisher=Twelve; First Edition edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his family at [[Kennedy Compound|their home]] (rented in 1926, then purchased in 1929)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=John F. Kennedy's Residences|accessdate=April 17, 2017 |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/Ready-Reference/JFK-Fast-Facts/Homes.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]], and Christmas and Easter holidays at their winter retreat in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], later purchased in 1933.

He attended [[Riverdale Country School]]—a private school for boys—from kindergarten through second grade. He then attended [[Bronxville Union Free School District|Bronxville Public School]] in lower Westchester County from third through fifth grade. He repeated the third grade.&lt;ref name="oppenheimer307"&gt;Oppenheimer, Jerry. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pLFNINq53NUC&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=kennedy%20repeated%20third%20grade&amp;pg=PA307#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Other Mrs. Kennedy]'', p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; A teacher at Bronxville reflected that he was "a regular boy". She added, "It seemed hard for him to finish his work sometimes. But he was only ten after all."&lt;ref name=Smith33 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hilty23-24&gt;Hilty, pp. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended Riverdale Country School for the sixth grade. Kennedy would later recall that during childhood he was "going to different schools, always having to make new friends, and that I was very awkward...[a]nd I was pretty quiet most of the time. And I didn't mind being alone."&lt;ref name=Schlesinger21-23 /&gt; He developed an interest in American history. He also decorated his bedroom with pictures of U.S. presidents and filled his bookshelves with volumes on the [[American Civil War]]. He also became an avid stamp collector and once received a handwritten letter from [[Franklin Roosevelt]], who was also a philatelist.&lt;ref name=Smith33 /&gt;

In March 1938, Kennedy sailed to [[London]] with his mother and four youngest siblings to join his father who had begun serving as Ambassador to the United Kingdom. He attended the private Gibbs School for Boys in London for seventh grade. In April 1939, he gave his first public speech at the placing of a cornerstone for a youth club in England. According to embassy and newspaper reports, his statements were pencilled in his own hand and were delivered in a "calm and confident" manner.&lt;ref&gt;Hilty, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bobby returned to the United States just before the outbreak of World War II in Europe.

===St. Paul's and Portsmouth Priory===
In September 1939, Kennedy began eighth grade at [[St. Paul's School (New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]], an elite Protestant private [[university-preparatory school|preparatory]] school for boys in [[Concord, New Hampshire]],&lt;ref name="RFK: A Memoir | Jack Newfield | August 27, 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m9m6b9i8SQQC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=robert+kennedy+st.+paul's+school+episcopalian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZqIPrW-plq&amp;sig=cmankTNYKL_fffdnxClm-uYSssU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KTVqUbr8CY21ywGEhICADQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=robert%20kennedy%20st.%20paul's%20school%20episcopalian&amp;f=false |title=RFK |work=google.com |accessdate=August 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821124759/https://books.google.com/books?id=m9m6b9i8SQQC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=robert%2Bkennedy%2Bst.%2Bpaul%27s%2Bschool%2Bepiscopalian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZqIPrW-plq&amp;sig=cmankTNYKL_fffdnxClm-uYSssU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KTVqUbr8CY21ywGEhICADQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgU |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that his father favored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/beran-patrician.html | title =Excerpt from Chapter one: The Last Patrician. Bobby Kennedy and the End of American Aristocracy | author =Michael Knox Beran | work =The New York Times | year =1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose Kennedy was unhappy with the school's use of the Protestant Bible. After two months, she took advantage of her ambassador husband's absence from Boston and withdrew Kennedy from St. Paul's. She enrolled him in [[Portsmouth Abbey School|Portsmouth Priory School]], a [[Benedictine]] Catholic boarding school for boys in [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island]], which held daily morning and evening prayers and Mass three times a week, with a High Mass on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy attended Portsmouth for eighth through tenth grade.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (2002) [1978] pp. 30, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Portsmouth Priory School, Kennedy was known as "Mrs. Kennedy's little boy Bobby" after he introduced his mother to classmates, who made fun of them. He was defensive of his mother, and on one occasion chased a student out of the dormitory after the boy had commented on her appearance.&lt;ref name=Thomas30 /&gt; He befriended Peter MacLellan and wrote to him, when his brother John was serving in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], that he would be visiting his brother "because he might be killed any minute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2014/08/29/john-kennedy-and-robert-kennedy-letters-auctioned/A3pZJQ7L9sek8L7WgNJVGO/story.html|title=John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy letters to be auctioned|date=August 30, 2014 |first=Matt|last=Viser|work=The Boston Globe }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy blamed himself when his grades failed to improve. In letters to her son, Rose urged him to read more and to strengthen his vocabulary.&lt;ref name=Hilty38 /&gt; Rose also expressed disappointment and wrote that she did not expect him to let her down.&lt;ref name=Mills34&gt;Mills, pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; He began developing in other ways, and his brother John noticed his increased physical strength, predicting that the younger Kennedy "would be bouncing me around plenty in two more years".&lt;ref name=Hilty38&gt;Hilty, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Monks at Portsmouth Priory School regarded him as a moody and indifferent student. Father Damian Kearney, who was two classes behind Kennedy, reflected that he "didn't look happy" and that he did not "smile much". According to Father Damian's review of school records, Kennedy was a "poor-to-mediocre student, except for history".&lt;ref name=Thomas30 /&gt;

===Milton Academy===
In September 1942, Kennedy transferred to his third boarding school, [[Milton Academy]], in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], for eleventh and twelfth grades.&lt;ref name=Schlesinger42&gt;Schlesinger (2002) [1978] p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Joseph Kennedy Sr., wanted Kennedy to transfer to Milton, believing it would better prepare his son for Harvard.&lt;ref name=Schlesinger42 /&gt; At Milton, he met and became friends with [[David Hackett]]. He invited Hackett to join him for Sunday mass. Hackett started accompanying him, and was impressed when Kennedy took it upon himself to fill in for a missing altar boy one Sunday.&lt;ref name=Thomas37-40 /&gt; Hackett admired Kennedy's determination to bypass his shortcomings, and remembered him redoubling his efforts whenever something did not come easy to him, which included athletics, studies, success with girls, and popularity.&lt;ref name=Mills34 /&gt; Hackett remembered the two of them being "misfits", a commonality that drew him to Kennedy, along with an unwillingness to conform to how others acted even if doing so meant not being accepted. Kennedy's grades improved.&lt;ref name=Thomas37-40 /&gt;

One of his first relationships was with a girl named Piedy Bailey. The pair was photographed together when he walked her home after chapel on a Sunday night. Bailey was fond of him and remembered him as being "very appealing". She recalled him being funny, "separate, larky; outside the cliques; private all the time". Soon after he transferred to Milton, he pressed his father to allow him to enlist, as he wanted to catch up to his brothers who were both serving in the military.&lt;ref name=Thomas37-40 /&gt; Kennedy had arrived at Milton unfamiliar with his peers and made little attempt to know the names of his classmates; he called most of the other boys "fella" instead. For this, he was nicknamed "Fella". Most of the school's students had come in eighth or ninth grade and cliques had already been formed. Despite this, his schoolmates would later say the school had no prejudice. He had an early sense of virtue; he disliked dirty jokes and bullying, once stepping in when an upperclassman tried bothering a younger student.&lt;ref name=Thomas37-40&gt;Thomas, pp. 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt; The headmaster at Milton would later summarize that he was a "very intelligent boy, quiet and shy, but not outstanding, and he left no special mark on Milton".&lt;ref name=Smith33 /&gt;

=== Relationship with parents ===
In Kennedy's younger years, his father dubbed him the "runt" of the family and wrote him off. Close family friend [[Lem Billings]] once remarked to Joe Sr. that he was "the most generous little boy", and Joe Sr. replied that he did not know where his son "got that". Billings commented that the only similarity between Robert and Joe Sr. was their eye color.&lt;ref name=Thomas30 /&gt; As Kennedy grew, his father worried that he was soft on others, conflicting with his ideology. In response, Kennedy developed a tough persona that masked his gentle personality, attempting to appease his father.&lt;ref name=Mills19&gt;Mills, pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Judie Mills wrote that Joe Sr.'s lack of interest in Robert was evident by the length of time it took for him to decide to transfer him to Milton Academy. Both Joe Jr. and John attended the exclusive Protestant prep school [[Choate School|Choate]] from their freshman year, while Robert was already a junior by the time he was enrolled at Milton. Despite his father's disdain, Kennedy continued to seek his approval, requesting that Joe Sr. write him a letter about his opinions on different political events and World War II.&lt;ref name=Mills34 /&gt;

As a child, Kennedy also strove to meet his mother's expectations to become the most dutiful, religious, affectionate, and obedient of the Kennedy children, but the father and son grew distant.&lt;ref name="Hilty15-16"/&gt; Rose found his gentle personality endearing, though this was noted as having made him "invisible to his father".&lt;ref name=Mills34 /&gt; She influenced him heavily and like her, he became a devout Catholic and throughout his lifetime he practiced his religion more seriously than the other boys in the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In His Own Right: The Political Odyssey of Senator Robert F. Kennedy|page=2.|first=Joseph A.|last=Palermo|year=2002 |publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231120692}}&lt;/ref&gt; He impressed his parents as a child by taking on a newspaper route, seeking their approval and wishing to distinguish himself. However, he had the family chauffeur driving him in a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] so that he could make his deliveries. His mother discovered this and the deliveries ceased.&lt;ref name=Mills19 /&gt;

Joe Sr. was satisfied with Kennedy as an adult, believing him to have become "hard as nails", more like him than any of the other children, while his mother believed he exemplified all she had wanted in a child. Mills wrote, "His parents' conflicting views would be echoed in the opinions of millions of people throughout Bobby's life. Robert Kennedy was a ruthless opportunist who would stop at nothing to attain his ambitions. Robert Kennedy was America's most compassionate public figure, the only person who could save a divided country."&lt;ref name=Mills19 /&gt;

==Naval service (1944–1946)==

Six weeks before his 18th birthday in 1943. Kennedy enlisted in the [[United States Navy Reserve|United States Naval Reserve]] as a [[seaman apprentice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/~/link.aspx?_id=ED4C953D8ECF46D9966C0AC50D254FEA&amp;_z=z |title=Ready Reference: Information about Robert F. Kennedy|publisher=jfklibrary.org |date =April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released from active duty in March 1944, when he left Milton Academy early to report to the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] at [[Harvard College]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. His V-12 training began at Harvard (March–November 1944) before he was relocated to [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]], Maine (November 1944–June 1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = July 1943: The Navy arrives {{!}} 150 Years {{!}} Bates College|url = http://www.bates.edu/150-years/months/july/navy-arrives/|website = www.bates.edu|accessdate = December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Harvard once again in June 1945 completing his post-training requirements in January 1946).&lt;ref name="Walter Isaacson"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RKzUqXc3BHgC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;lpg=PA285&amp;dq=bobby+kennedy+Portsmouth+Priory+School#v=onepage&amp;q=bobby%20kennedy%20Portsmouth%20Priory%20School&amp;f=false |title=Profiles in Leadership: Historians on the Elusive Quality of Greatness |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |author=[[Walter Isaacson]] |date=October 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821132649/https://books.google.com/books?id=RKzUqXc3BHgC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;lpg=PA285&amp;dq=bobby%2Bkennedy%2BPortsmouth%2BPriory%2BSchool&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VK_i4q8FJB&amp;sig=N8tSyjGVZnBB-JGhjc9Aey89Dns&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kUtqUb2xNerQyAGFloHwAw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAjgK |archivedate=August 21, 2016|deadurl=yes|isbn=9780393340761}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Bates he received a specialized V-12 degree along with 15 others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert F.

He talked of filling his free time by taking classes with other sailors and remarked that "things are the same as usual up here, and me being my usual moody self I get very sad at times." He added, "If I don't get the hell out of here soon I'll die." Aside from Hackett, who was serving as a paratrooper, more of his [[Campus of Bates College|Parker Hall]] dorm mates went overseas and left him behind. With others entering combat before him, Kennedy said this made him "feel more and more like a Draft Dodger (sic) or something". He was also frustrated with the apparent desire to shirk military responsibility by some of the other V-12 students.&lt;ref name="Thomas44" /&gt;

Kennedy's brother Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. died in August 1944,&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, August 15 and 17, 1944 (announcement of Kennedy's death) and October 25, 1945 (detailed account of the mission)&lt;/ref&gt; when his bomber exploded during a volunteer mission known as [[Operation Aphrodite]]. Robert was most affected by his father's reaction to his eldest son's passing. He appeared completely heartbroken and his peer Fred Garfield commented that Kennedy developed depression and questioned his faith for a short time. After his brother's death, Kennedy gained more attention, moving higher up the family patriarchy.&lt;ref name=Thomas44&gt;Thomas, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 15, 1945, the [[Navy|U.S. Navy]] commissioned the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.|DD-850|6}}, and shortly thereafter granted Kennedy's request to be released from naval-officer training to serve aboard ''Kennedy'' starting on February 1, 1946, as a seaman apprentice on the ship's [[shakedown cruise]] in the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]].&lt;ref name="Walter Isaacson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/maritime/jpk.htm | title =USS Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. | author =''[[U.S. National Park Service]]'' | publisher =nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 30, 1946, he received his [[honorable discharge]] from the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (2002) [1978] p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; For his service in the Navy, Kennedy was eligible for the [[American Campaign Medal]] and the [[World War II Victory Medal]].

==Further study and journalism (1946–1951)==
In September 1946, Kennedy entered Harvard as a junior, having received credit for his time in the V-12 program.&lt;ref name="E.W.

Joseph Sr. attended some of Kennedy's practices and saw his son catch a touchdown pass in an early-season rout of Western Maryland. His teammates admired his physical courage. He was five feet ten and 155 pounds, which made him too small for college football. Despite this, he was a fearless hitter and once tackled a 230-pound fullback head-on. Wally Flynn, another player, looked up in the huddle after one play to see him crying after he broke his leg.

Throughout 1946, Kennedy became active in his brother John's campaign for the U.S. Representative seat that was vacated by [[James Michael Curley|James Curley]]; he joined the campaign full-time after his naval discharge.

In November 1951, Kennedy moved with his wife and daughter to a townhouse in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] in Washington, D.C., and started work as a lawyer in the Internal Security Section of the [[United States Department of Justice Criminal Division|Criminal Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]; the section was charged with investigating suspected Soviet agents.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, Robert F., 1951 | Arthur J.

In December 1952, at the behest of his father, Kennedy was appointed by family friend [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] as assistant counsel of the [[United States Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]],&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (1978) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=savmappq&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bobby Kennedy: The Making of a Liberal Legend|last=Tye|first=Larry|publisher=Random House|year=2016|isbn=9780812993349|location=New York|pages=68|quote="It is unclear where the rumor began about McCarthy being godfather to Bobby's firstborn, Kathleen.

After a period as an assistant to his father on the [[Hoover Commission]], Kennedy rejoined the Senate committee staff as chief counsel for the Democratic minority in February 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (1978) p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; That month, McCarthy's chief counsel [[Roy Cohn]] subpoenaed [[Annie Lee Moss]], accusing her of membership in the Communist Party. Kennedy revealed that Cohn had called the wrong Annie Lee Moss and he requested the file on Moss from the FBI. FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] had been forewarned by Cohn and denied him access, referring to RFK as "an arrogant whipper-snapper".&lt;ref name=Hilty86&gt;Hilty, pp. 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Democrats gained the majority in the Senate in January 1955, Kennedy became chief counsel and was a background figure in the televised [[Army-McCarthy Hearings]] of 1954 into McCarthy's conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (1978) pp. 113, 115&lt;/ref&gt; The Annie Lee Moss incident turned Cohn into an enemy, which led to Kennedy assisting Democratic senators in ridiculing Cohn during the hearings.

=== Stevenson aide and focus on organized labor (1956–1960) ===
Kennedy went on to work as an aide to [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] during the [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956 presidential election]] which helped him learn how national campaigns worked, in preparation for a future run by his brother, Jack.&lt;ref&gt;Hilty, pp. 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt; Unimpressed with Stevenson, he reportedly voted for incumbent [[Dwight D.

Edgar Hoover.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; There seemed to be some improvement in their interactions, which came to be seen as "elemental political necessity" by Kennedy. This later changed after Kennedy was appointed attorney general, where Hoover saw him as an "unprecedented threat".&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (2002) [1978] pp. 254-256&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1957 to 1959 he made a name for himself while serving as the chief counsel to the Senate's [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management|McClellan Committee]] under chairman [[John L. McClellan]]. Kennedy was given authority over testimony scheduling, areas of investigation, and witness questioning by McClellan, a move that was made by the chairman to limit attention to himself and allow outrage by organized labor to be directed toward Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Cabell.

March 17, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; In a famous scene, Kennedy squared off with [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters Union]] President [[Jimmy Hoffa]] during the antagonistic argument that marked Hoffa's testimony.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (1978) pp. 137–91&lt;/ref&gt; During the hearings, Kennedy received criticism from liberal critics and other commentators both for his outburst of impassioned anger and doubts about the innocence of those who invoked the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Shesol, Jeff.

They believed Kennedy covered for [[Walter Reuther]] and the [[United Automobile Workers]], a union which typically would back Democratic office seekers. Amidst the allegations, Kennedy wrote in his journal that the two senators had "no guts" as they never addressed him directly, only through the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Robert Kennedy: His Life|first=Evan|last=Thomas|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2002|isbn=978-0743203296}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the committee in late 1959 in order to run his brother's presidential campaign.

=== JFK presidential campaign (1960) ===
In 1960, Kennedy published the successful book, which he had drafted over the summer of the previous year, ''The Enemy Within'', describing the corrupt practices within the Teamsters and other unions that he had helped investigate. Biographer Evan Thomas wrote that the book was a bestseller and could have launched a political career on its own, but "family duty called",&lt;ref name=Thomas88&gt;Thomas, pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kennedy went to work on the presidential campaign of his brother, John.  In contrast to his role in his brother's previous campaign eight years prior, Kennedy gave stump speeches throughout the primary season, gaining confidence as time went on.&lt;ref&gt;Hilty, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; His strategy "to win at any cost" led him to call on [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr.]] to attack [[Hubert Humphrey]] as a draft dodger; Roosevelt eventually did make the statement that Humphrey avoided service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=John F.

Concerned that John Kennedy was going to receive the Democratic Party's nomination, some supporters of Lyndon Johnson, who was also running for the nomination, revealed to the press that JFK had [[Addison's disease]], saying that he required life-sustaining cortisone treatments. Though in fact a diagnosis had been made, Kennedy tried to protect his brother by denying the allegation, saying that JFK had never had "an ailment described classically as Addison's disease".&lt;ref&gt;Sabato, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;  After securing the nomination, John Kennedy nonetheless decided to offer Lyndon Johnson the vice presidency. This did not sit well with some Kennedy supporters, and Robert tried unsuccessfully to convince Johnson to turn down the offer, leading him to view Robert with contempt afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/26/reviews/971026.26oshinkt.html |title=Fear and Loathing in the White House| date=October 26, 1997|first=David M.|last=Oshinsky| work=The New York Times | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822202643/https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/26/reviews/971026.26oshinkt.html | archivedate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; RFK had already disliked Johnson prior to the presidential campaign, seeing him as a threat to his brother's ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; RFK wanted his brother to choose labor leader [[Walter Reuther]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3491219/behind-the-picture-jfk-and-rfk-los-angeles-july-1960/|title=Head to Head: JFK and RFK, Los Angeles, July 1960|last=Cosgrave|first=Ben|date=May 24, 2014|website=Time Magazine|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Kennedy's attempts, Johnson became his brother's running mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1960: LBJ Vs.

Kennedy worked toward downplaying his brother's Catholic faith during the primary but took a more aggressive and supportive stance during the general election. These concerns were mostly calmed after JFK delivered a speech in September in Houston where he said that he was in favor of the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Kennedy was involved in securing the release of civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] from a jail in [[Atlanta]].

After winning the 1960 presidential election, President-elect John F. Kennedy appointed his younger brother attorney general.

According to [[Bobby Baker]], the Senate majority secretary and a protégé of Lyndon Johnson, President-elect Kennedy did not want to name his brother attorney general. However, their father overruled the president-elect. At the behest of Johnson, Baker persuaded the influential Southern senator [[Richard Russell Jr.|Richard Russell]] to allow a voice vote to confirm the president's brother in January 1961, as Kennedy "would have been lucky to get 40 votes" on a roll-call vote.&lt;ref name="BobbyBaker"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/836424-baker-text.html#document/p203 |title=Doing Business |last1=Baker |first1=Bobby |last2=Ritchie |first2=Donald |date=March 4, 2010|publisher=Senate Historical Office|accessdate=November 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy performed well in his confirmation hearing and chose what friend and biographer [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] called an "outstanding" group of deputy and assistant attorneys general, including [[Byron White]] and [[Nicholas Katzenbach]].&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"/&gt;

Author James W. Hilty concludes that Kennedy "played an unusual combination of roles—campaign director, attorney general, executive overseer, controller of patronage, chief adviser, and brother protector" and that nobody before him had had such power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James W.

He was relied upon as both the president's primary source of administrative information, and as a general counsel with whom trust was implicit. He exercised widespread authority over every cabinet department, leading the [[Associated Press]] to dub him "Bobby—Washington's No. 2-man".&lt;ref name="James W. Hilty 2000 408"/&gt;

The president once remarked about his brother, "If I want something done and done immediately I rely on the Attorney General.

===Berlin===
As one of the president's closest White House advisers, Kennedy played a crucial role in the events surrounding the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://instruct.westvalley.edu/kelly/PoliSci4_on_campus/Online%20Readings/stiles_cuban_missile.htm | title =The Cuban Missile Crisis: Rationality – Case Histories in International Politics, 5th Edition | author =Kendall Stiles | publisher =westvalley.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating mainly through a private [[backchannel]] connection to Soviet spy [[Georgi Bolshakov]], he relayed important diplomatic communications between the American and Soviet governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.reuters.com/berlin1961/2011/06/14/kennedys-showdown-at-checkpoint-charlie/ | title =Berlin 1961 Kennedy, Khrushchev and the most dangerous place on Earth Kennedy's showdown at Checkpoint Charlie | author =''[[Frederick Kempe]]'' | publisher =reuters.com | date =June 14, 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822204203/http://blogs.reuters.com/berlin1961/2011/06/14/kennedys-showdown-at-checkpoint-charlie/ | archivedate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most significantly, this connection helped the U.S. set up the [[Vienna Summit]] in June 1961, and later to defuse the tank standoff with the Soviets at Berlin's [[Checkpoint Charlie]] in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kempe|first=Frederick|title=Berlin 1961|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Group (USA)|isbn=0-399-15729-8|pages=478–479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organized crime and the Teamsters===
[[File:Hoover Kennedys 1961 by Abbie Rowe.jpg|thumb|J. Edgar Hoover (middle) with John and Robert Kennedy in 1961]]

As attorney general, Kennedy pursued a relentless crusade against [[organized crime]] and the [[American Mafia|Mafia]], sometimes disagreeing on strategy with [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. Convictions against organized crime figures rose by 800 percent during his term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/dec/10/patricia-scotland-robert-kennedy | title=My legal hero: Robert F Kennedy | publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | date=December 10, 2010 | accessdate=August 22, 2016 | author=Scotland, Patricia | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822205415/https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/dec/10/patricia-scotland-robert-kennedy | archivedate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy worked to shift Hoover's focus away from communism, which Hoover saw as a more serious threat, to organized crime. According to [[James Neff]], Kennedy's success in this endeavor was due to his brother's position, giving the attorney general leverage over Hoover.&lt;ref name=npr2015&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/07/06/420595057/vendetta-recalls-the-ruthless-rivalry-between-bobby-kennedy-jimmy-hoffa|title='Vendetta' Recalls The Ruthless Rivalry Between Bobby Kennedy, Jimmy Hoffa|date=July 6, 2015|publisher=npr.org | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822205623/http://www.npr.org/2015/07/06/420595057/vendetta-recalls-the-ruthless-rivalry-between-bobby-kennedy-jimmy-hoffa | archivedate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Richard Hack]] concluded that Hoover's dislike for Kennedy came from his being unable to control him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4638275/ns/dateline_nbc/t/secrets-j-edgar-hoover/#.Vv8d-GNhqqA|title=The secrets of J.

He was relentless in his pursuit of [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters Union]] president [[Jimmy Hoffa]], due to Hoffa's known corruption in financial and electoral matters, both personally and organizationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Fall05/slewis/Ch2.html | title =The Disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa | author =''[[University of Florida]]'' | publisher =jou.ufl.edu | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822210018/http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Fall05/slewis/Ch2.html | archivedate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enmity between the two men was intense, with accusations of a personal vendetta – what Hoffa called a "blood feud" – exchanged between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Hoffa__Jimmy.html | title =Hoffa, James Riddle | author =Jacqueline A.

===Civil rights===
Kennedy expressed the administration's commitment to civil rights during a 1961 [[Law Day Address|speech]] at the [[University of Georgia Law School]]:

{{quote|We will not stand by or be aloof—we will move. I happen to believe that [[Brown v. Board of Education|the 1954 decision]] was right. But my belief does not matter. It is now the law. Some of you may believe the decision was wrong. That does not matter. It is the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/rfkgeorgialawschool.htm | title=Law Day Address at the University of Georgia Law School | publisher=American Rhetoric | accessdate=23 August 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822211236/http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/rfkgeorgialawschool.htm | archivedate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In May 1961, he predicted that an African-American "can also achieve the same position that my brother has as President of the United States" over the course of the next thirty to forty years. Larry Sabato would later write that when RFK's family backed [[Barack Obama]] in 2008, they picked a candidate with great differences in upbringing from that of the privileged President Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;Sabato, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Kennedy CORE rally speech2.jpg|thumb|left|Robert Kennedy speaking to civil rights demonstrators in front of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] on June 14, 1963]]

FBI Director J.

In response, King agreed to ask suspected Communist [[Jack O'Dell]] to resign from the SCLC, but refused to heed to the request to ask [[Stanley Levison]], whom he regarded as a trusted advisor, to resign.&lt;ref name=rking /&gt; In October 1963,&lt;ref name=rking /&gt; Kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other leaders of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], King's civil rights organization.&lt;ref name="'70s 41"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York City|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's phones "on a trial basis, for a month or so",&lt;ref&gt;Herst, Burton (2007). ''Bobby and J. Edgar'', p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover extended the clearance so that his men were "unshackled" to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy.&lt;ref&gt;Herst, Burton, (2007) pp 372–374.&lt;/ref&gt; The wiretapping continued through June 1966 and was revealed in 1968, days before Kennedy's death.&lt;ref name="the atlantic"&gt;{{cite news |title= The FBI and Martin Luther King|last= Garrow|first= David J.|authorlink= David Garrow|date= July 8, 2002|work= The Atlantic Monthly|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200207/garrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy remained committed to civil rights enforcement to such a degree that he commented in 1962 that it seemed to envelop almost every area of his public and private life, from prosecuting corrupt Southern electoral officials to answering late night calls from [[Coretta Scott King]] concerning the imprisonment of her husband for demonstrations in Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahoney|first=Richard D.|title=Sons &amp; Brothers: The Days of Jack and Bobby Kennedy|year=1999|publisher=Arcade Publishing|isbn=978-1559704809|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as attorney general, he undertook the most energetic and persistent desegregation of the administration that Capitol Hill had ever experienced. He demanded that every area of government begin recruiting realistic levels of black and other ethnic workers, going so far as to criticize Vice President Johnson for his failure to desegregate his own office staff.  However, relations between the Kennedys and civil rights activists could be tense, partly due to the administration's decision that a number of complaints which King filed with the Justice Department between 1961 and 1963 be handled "through negotiation between the city commission and Negro citizens."&lt;ref name=rking&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_kennedy_robert_francis_19251968/|title=Kennedy, Robert Francis (1925-1968)|website=kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it has become commonplace to assert the phrase "[[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|The Kennedy Administration]]" or even "President Kennedy" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the civil rights movement, between 1960 and 1963 a great many of the initiatives that occurred during his tenure were the result of the passion and determination of an emboldened Robert Kennedy, who, through his rapid education in the realities of Southern racism, underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as attorney general. Asked in an interview in May 1962, "What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it crime or internal security?" Kennedy replied, "Civil rights."&lt;ref&gt;Bob Spivack, Interview of the Attorney General, May 12, 1962; published in "Robert Kennedy and His Times," by Arthur M. Schlesinger, p. 313, Ballantine Books (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The president came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters at hand to such an extent that it was at the attorney general's insistence that he made his famous [[Report to the American People on Civil Rights|June 1963 address to the nation on civil rights]].&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur M. Jr.|title=Robert Kennedy and His Times|year=1978|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RFK and MLK together.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy in Washington, D.C. on June 22, 1963]]

Kennedy played a large role in the response to the [[Freedom Riders]] protests. He acted after the [[Anniston, Alabama#The Civil Rights era|Anniston bus bombings]] to protect the Riders in continuing their journey, sending [[John Seigenthaler]], his administrative assistant, to Alabama to attempt to secure the Riders' safety there. Despite a work rule which allowed a driver to decline an assignment which he regarded as a potentially unsafe one, he persuaded a manager of [[The Greyhound Corporation]] to obtain a coach operator who was willing to drive a special bus for the continuance of the Freedom Ride from Birmingham, Alabama, to Montgomery, Alabama, on the circuitous journey to Jackson, Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;Rucker, Walter, Upton James (2007). ''Encyclopedia of American Race Riots''. Greenwood Publishing Press, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during the attack and burning by a white mob of the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, at which Martin Luther King Jr. and some 1,500 sympathizers were in attendance, the attorney general telephoned King to ask for his assurance that they would not leave the building until the force of [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] and [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] he sent had secured the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for "allowing the situation to continue". King later publicly thanked him for dispatching the forces to break up the attack that might otherwise have ended his life.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, Edward. Gould, Lewis. Oshinsky, David. (2008). American Passages: A History of the United States: Since 1865, Vol. 2, Cengage Learning, p. 853.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy then negotiated the safe passage of the Freedom Riders from the First Baptist Church to Jackson, Mississippi, where they were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Arsenault, Raymond (2006). Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice. Oxford UP. {{ISBN|978-0-19-513674-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He offered to bail the Freedom Riders out of jail, but they refused, which upset him, leading him to call any bandwagoners of the original freedom rides "honkers".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Kennedy's attempts to end the Freedom Rides early were tied to an upcoming summit with [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Charles de Gaulle]]. He believed the continued international publicity of race riots would tarnish the president heading into international negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, Arthur (2002). Robert Kennedy and His Times, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; This attempt to curtail the Freedom Rides alienated many of the civil rights leaders who, at the time, perceived him as intolerant and narrow-minded.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to better understand and improve race relations, Kennedy held a [[Baldwin–Kennedy meeting|private meeting in New York City in May 1963]] with a black delegation coordinated by prominent author [[James Baldwin]].

In September 1962, Kennedy sent U.S. marshals to [[Oxford, Mississippi]], to enforce a federal court order allowing the admittance of the first African-American student, [[James Meredith]], to the [[University of Mississippi]]. The attorney general had hoped that legal means, along with the escort of U.S. marshals, would be enough to force Governor [[Ross Barnett]] to allow Meredith's admission. He also was very concerned there might be a "mini-civil war" between U.S. Army troops and armed protesters.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (2002) [1978], pp. 317–320.&lt;/ref&gt; President Kennedy reluctantly sent federal troops after the situation on campus turned violent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bryant |first= Nick |date=Autumn 2006 |title= Black Man Who Was Crazy Enough to Apply to Ole Miss |journal= The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education |issue= 53 |page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ensuing [[Ole Miss riot of 1962|riots during the period of Meredith's admittance]] resulted in hundreds of injuries and two deaths,&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/10/01/161573289/integrating-ole-miss-a-transformative-deadly-riot |title=Integrating Ole Miss: A Transformative, Deadly Riot |work=NPR |date=October 1, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822214711/http://www.npr.org/2012/10/01/161573289/integrating-ole-miss-a-transformative-deadly-riot | archivedate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet Kennedy remained adamant that black students had the right to enjoy the benefits of all levels of the educational system. The Office of Civil Rights also hired its first African-American lawyer{{when|date=October 2017}} and began to work cautiously with leaders of the [[Civil Rights Movement]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Kennedy saw voting as the key to racial justice and collaborated with Presidents Kennedy and Johnson to create the landmark [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which helped bring an end to [[Jim Crow laws]]. Between December 1961 and December 1963, Kennedy also expanded the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division]] by 60 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Belknap| first = Michal R.| title = Federal Law and Southern Order: Racial Violence and Constitutional Conflict in the Post-Brown South| publisher = University of Georgia Press| series = Studies in the legal history of the South| edition = illustrated, reprint| date = 1995| pages = 72| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IIXxGKEqg_oC&amp;dq= | isbn = 9780820317359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Steel===
At the direction of the president, Kennedy also used the power of federal agencies to influence [[U.S. Steel]] not to institute a price increase.&lt;ref name="time steel"&gt;{{cite news |title= Smiting the Foe|date=April 20, 1962|work=Time|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/printout/0,8816,873526,00.html|accessdate=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that the administration had set prices of steel "by naked power, by threats, by agents of the state security police."&lt;ref name="jfk bio"&gt;{{cite book |title= John F.

===Death penalty issues===
During the Kennedy administration, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] carried out its last pre-[[Furman v. Georgia|''Furman'']] federal execution (of [[Victor Feguer]] in [[Iowa]], 1963),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usmarshals.gov/history/executions.htm |title=History: Historical Federal Executions |accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kennedy, as attorney general, represented the government in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/feguer3.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030727091512/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/feguer3.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 27, 2003 |title=The Smoking Gun: Public Documents, Mug Shots |work=thesmokinggun.com |accessdate=August 25, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Kennedy expressed his strong willingness to support a bill then under consideration for the abolition of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Robert+F.+Kennedy+Miscellaneous+Information.htm |date=January 17, 2006 |accessdate=May 3, 2009 |title=Robert F.

===Cuba===
As his brother's confidant, Kennedy oversaw the CIA's anti-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] activities after the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]. He also helped develop the strategy during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] to blockade Cuba instead of initiating a military strike that might have led to nuclear war. He had initially been among the more hawkish members of the administration on matters concerning Cuban insurrectionist aid. His initial strong support for covert actions in Cuba soon changed to a position of removal from further involvement once he became aware of the CIA's tendency to draw out initiatives, and provide itself with almost unchecked authority in matters of foreign covert operations.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

[[File:President with Attorney General. President Kennedy, Attorney General Kennedy. White House, Oval Office Doorway. - NARA - 194221.jpg|thumb|left|President Kennedy with his brother Robert, 1963]]

Allegations that the Kennedys knew of plans by the CIA to kill [[Fidel Castro]], or approved of such plans, have been debated by historians over the years. JFK's friend and associate, historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], for example, expressed the opinion that operatives linked to the CIA were among the most reckless individuals to have operated during the period—providing themselves with unscrutinized freedoms to threaten the lives of Castro and other members of the Cuban revolutionary government regardless of the legislative apparatus in Washington—freedoms that, unbeknownst to those at the White House attempting to prevent a nuclear war, placed the entire U.S.–Soviet relationship in perilous danger.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy proved himself to be a gifted politician with an ability to obtain compromises, tempering aggressive positions of key figures in the hawk camp. The trust the President placed in him on matters of negotiation was such that his role in the crisis is today seen as having been of vital importance in securing a blockade, which averted a full military engagement between the United States and Soviet Russia. His clandestine meetings with members of the Soviet Government continued to provide a key link to Nikita Khrushchev during even the darkest moments of the Crisis, in which the threat of nuclear strikes was considered a very present reality.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, "The Cuban Connection", Robert Kennedy and His Times&lt;/ref&gt; On the last night of the crisis, President Kennedy was so grateful for his brother's work in averting nuclear war that he summed it up by saying, "Thank God for Bobby."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_10_32/ai_66495286 Clarity Through Complexity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223120100/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_10_32/ai_66495286 |date=December 23, 2007 }}, October 2000, [http://findarticles.com/ FindArticles.com]{{cbignore}}, Retrieved June 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assassination of President John F. Kennedy ===
[[File:JFK's family leaves Capitol after his funeral, 1963.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Robert Kennedy at the funeral of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, November 25, 1963]]

At the time that President Kennedy [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|was assassinated]] in Dallas on November 22, 1963, RFK was at home with aides from the Justice Department. J. Edgar Hoover called and told him his brother had been shot;&lt;ref name=Palmero1-6 /&gt; before he could ask any questions, Hoover hung up. Kennedy later said he thought Hoover had enjoyed telling him the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=131457&amp;page=1|title=Robert Kennedy Struggled With JFK's Assassination|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy then received a call from Tazewell Shepard, a naval aide to the president, who told him that his brother was dead.&lt;ref name=Palmero1-6&gt;{{cite book|title=In His Own Right: The Political Odyssey of Senator Robert F. Kennedy|first=Joseph A.|last=Palmero|year=2002|pages=1–6.|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the call from Hoover, Kennedy phoned [[McGeorge Bundy]] at the White House, instructing him to change the locks on the president's files. He ordered the Secret Service to dismantle the Oval Office and cabinet room's secret taping systems. He scheduled a meeting with CIA director [[John McCone]] and asked if the CIA had any involvement in his brother's death. McCone denied it, with Kennedy later telling investigator Walter Sheridan that he asked the director "in a way that he couldn't lie to me, and they [the CIA] hadn't".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, pp. 276-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

An hour after the president was shot, Bobby Kennedy received a phone call from Vice President Johnson before Johnson boarded [[Air Force One]]. RFK remembered their conversation starting with Johnson demonstrating sympathy before the vice president stated his belief that he should be sworn in immediately; RFK opposed the idea since he felt "it would be nice" for President Kennedy's body to return to Washington with the deceased president still being the incumbent.&lt;ref&gt;Sabato, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the two concluded that the best course of action would be for Johnson to take the oath of office before returning to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lyndon B.

Kennedy was asked by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] leaders to introduce a film about his late brother at [[1964 Democratic National Convention|the 1964 party convention]]. When he was introduced, the crowd, including party bosses, elected officials, and delegates, applauded thunderously and tearfully for a full 22 minutes before they would let him speak.&lt;ref&gt;Grubin, David. ''RFK''. American Experience, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He was close to breaking down before he spoke about his brother's vision for both the party and the nation and recited a quote from Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (3.2) that Jacqueline had given him:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;When [he] shall die
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The ten-month investigation by the [[Warren Commission]] of 1963–1964 concluded that the president had been assassinated by [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] and that Oswald had acted alone. On September 27, 1964, Kennedy issued a statement through his New York campaign office: "As I said in Poland last summer, I am convinced Oswald was solely responsible for what happened and that he did not have any outside help or assistance. He was a malcontent who could not get along here or in the Soviet Union."&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; September 28, 1964"&gt;{{cite news|title=JFK Report Is Approved By Robert|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m9haAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hWwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3479%2C4668179|accessdate=July 19, 2015|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=September 28, 1964|agency=AP|location=Pittsburgh|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He added, "I have not read the report, nor do I intend to.

The killing was judged as having a profound impact on Kennedy. Beran assesses the assassination as having moved Kennedy away from reliance on the political system and become more questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/books/news/9806/05/last.patrician/index.html|title=Beran's 'Last Patrician' reconsiders Bobby Kennedy's politics|first=Jamie|last=Allen|date=June 5, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tye views Kennedy following the death of his brother as "more fatalistic, having seen how fast he could lose what he cherished the most."&lt;ref&gt;Tye, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vice presidential candidate ==
[[File:David Dubinsky with Robert F. Kennedy; sign in background reads, in part, "For President- Lyndon B. Johnson.".jpg|thumb|left|Robert Kennedy with [[David Dubinsky]] in an undated photo. The sign in the background reads, "For President - Lyndon B. Johnson".]]

In the wake of the assassination of his brother and Lyndon Johnson's ascension to the presidency, with the office of vice president now vacant, Kennedy was viewed favorably as a potential candidate for the position in the 1964 presidential election. Several Kennedy partisans called for him to be drafted in tribute to his brother; national polling showing that three of four Democrats were in favor of him as Johnson's running mate. Democratic organizers supported him as a write-in candidate in the New Hampshire primary and 25,000 Democrats wrote in Kennedy's name in March 1964, only 3,700 fewer than the number of Democrats who wrote in Johnson's name as their pick for president.&lt;ref name="Palmero1-6"/&gt;

Kennedy discussed the vice presidency with Arthur Schlesinger. Schlesinger thought that he should develop his own political base first, and Kennedy observed that the job "was really based on waiting around for someone to die". In his first interview after the assassination Kennedy said he was not considering the vice presidency. During this time he said of the coalescing Johnson administration, "It's too early for me to even think about '64, because I don't know whether I want to have any part of these people.... if they don't fulfill and follow out my brother's program, I don't want to have anything to do with them."&lt;ref name="Bohrer2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bohrer, John R.|title=The Revolution of Robert Kennedy: From Power to Protest After JFK|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zJqZDgAAQBAJ|accessdate=October 19, 2017|date=June 6, 2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-60819-982-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in January 1964 Kennedy did begin low key inquiries as to the vice-presidential position and by the summer was developing plans to help Johnson in cities and in the Northeast based on the 1960 JFK campaign strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Kennedy's Secret Campaign to Become Lyndon Johnson's Vice President|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/robert-kennedys-secret-campaign-to-become-lyndon-johnsons-vice-president|author=Bohrer, John R.|date=May 24, 2017|publisher=[[Daily Beast]]|access-date=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fanfare within the Democratic Party, President Johnson was not inclined to have Kennedy on his ticket. The two men disliked one another intensely, with feelings often described as "mutual contempt" that went back to their first meeting in 1953 and had only intensified during JFK's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Shesol, ''Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy, and the Feud that Defined a Decade'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Caro, ''The Passage of Power'' (2012) pp. 61–63, 243–249.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson instead chose [[Hubert Humphrey]] to be his running mate.&lt;ref name="Palmero1-6"/&gt;

During a post-presidency interview with historian [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]], Johnson claimed that Kennedy "acted like he was the custodian of the Kennedy dream" despite Johnson being seen as this after JFK was assassinated, arguing that he had "waited" his turn and Kennedy should have done the same. Johnson recalled a "tidal wave of letters and memos about how great a vice president Bobby would be" being swept upon him, but knowing that he could not "let it happen" as he viewed the possibility of having Kennedy on the ticket as ensuring that he would never know if he could be elected "on my own".&lt;ref name=Sabato269&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kennedy Half-Century: The Presidency, Assassination, and Lasting Legacy of John F. Kennedy|first=Larry J.|last=Sabato|year=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|isbn=978-1620402825|pages=269–271.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1964, Johnson issued an official statement ruling out all of his current cabinet members as potential running mates, judging them to be "so valuable ... in their current posts". In response to this statement, angry letters poured in directed towards both Johnson and his wife, [[Lady Bird Johnson|Lady Bird]], expressing disappointment at Kennedy being dropped from the field of potential running mates.&lt;ref name=Sabato269 /&gt; Johnson, worried that delegates at the convention would draft Kennedy onto the ticket, ordered the FBI to monitor Kennedy's contacts, actions, and to make sure that he could not speak until after Hubert Humphrey was confirmed as his running mate.&lt;ref name="Palmero1-6"/&gt;

Nine months after his brother's assassination, Kennedy left the cabinet to run for a seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] representing New York,&lt;ref&gt;Dallek (1998), ''Flawed Giant: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1961–1973'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; announcing his candidacy on August 22, 1964, two days before that year's Democratic National Convention. He had considered the possibility of running since early spring, but also giving consideration to leaving politics altogether after the plane crash and injury of his brother Ted in June, two months earlier. Positive reception in Europe convinced him to remain in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (1978), p. 666.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy was lauded during concurrent trips to Germany and Poland, the denizens of the latter country's greetings to Kennedy being interpreted by Leaming as evaporating the agony he had sustained since his brother's passing.&lt;ref name=Leaming178&gt;Leaming, Barbara (2014).

Despite their notoriously difficult relationship, Johnson gave considerable support to Kennedy's campaign.

===Tenure===
Kennedy drew attention in Congress early on as the brother of President Kennedy, which set him apart from other senators. He drew more than fifty senators as spectators when he delivered a speech in the Senate on nuclear proliferation in June 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Palermo, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also saw a decline in his power, going from the president's most trusted advisor to one of a hundred senators, and his impatience with collaborative lawmaking showed.&lt;ref name=Canellos /&gt; Though fellow senator [[Fred R.

While serving in the Senate, Kennedy advocated [[gun control]]. In May 1965 he co-sponsored S.1592, proposed by President Johnson and sponsored by Senator [[Thomas J. Dodd]], that would put federal restrictions on mail-order gun sales.&lt;ref name="cq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal65-1259893|title=Hearings Held on Administration Gun Control Bill|year=1965|work=CQ Almanac Online Edition|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}{{subscription required|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in support of the bill, Kennedy said, "For too long we dealt with these deadly weapons as if they were harmless toys. Yet their very presence, the ease of their acquisition and the familiarity of their appearance have led to thousands of deaths each year. With the passage of this bill we will begin to meet our responsibilities. It would save hundreds of thousands of lives in this country and spare thousands of families…grief and heartache…."&lt;ref name="cq"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gun Control|page=57.|first=Susan Dudley|last=Gold|year=2004|publisher=Cavendish Square Publishing|isbn=978-0761415848}}&lt;/ref&gt; In remarks during a May 1968 campaign stop in [[Roseburg, Oregon]], Kennedy defended the bill as keeping firearms away from "people who have no business with guns or rifles".

Kennedy and his staff had employed a cautionary "amendments–only" strategy for his first year in the senate. In 1966 and 1967 they took more direct legislative action, but were met with increasing resistance from the Johnson administration.&lt;ref&gt;Shesol (1997) p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Despite perceptions that the two were hostile in their respective offices to each other, ''[[U.S. News]]'' reported Kennedy's support of the Johnson administration's "[[Great Society]]" program through his voting record. Kennedy supported both major and minor parts of the program, and each year over 60% of his roll call votes were consistently in favor of Johnson's policies.&lt;ref&gt;Shesol (1997) p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 1966, Kennedy urged the United States to pledge that it would not be the first country to use nuclear weapons against countries that did not have them noting that China had made the pledge and the [[Soviet Union]] indicated it was also willing to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/1966-kennedy-seeks-nuclear-pledge/?_r=0|title=1966: Kennedy Seeks Nuclear Pledge|publisher=New York Times|date=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1966, he visited [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid-era South Africa]] accompanied by his wife, Ethel, and a few aides. The tour was greeted with international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. He spoke out against the oppression of the native population, and was welcomed by the black population as though he were a visiting head of state. In an interview with ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine he said:

{{quote|At the [[University of Natal]] in [[Durban]], I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve. 'But suppose God is black', I replied. 'What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?' There was no answer. Only silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Robert F.|url=http://www.rfksa.org/magazines/magazine.php?id=6|title=Suppose god is Black|date=August 23, 1966|work=Look|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041023010025/http://rfksa.org/magazines/magazine.php?id=6|archivedate=October 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
At the [[University of Cape Town]] he delivered the annual [[Day of Affirmation Address]]. A quote from this address appears on his memorial at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]: "Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfksa.org/contents/overview.php|work=Ripple of Hope in the Land of Apartheid: Robert F.

On January 28, 1967, Kennedy began a ten-day stay in Europe, meeting [[Harold Wilson]] in [[London]] and advising him to tell President Johnson about his belief that the ongoing Vietnam conflict was wrong. Upon returning to the U.S. in early February, he was confronted by the press who asked him if his conversations abroad had negatively impacted American foreign relations.&lt;ref&gt;Shesol (1997) pp. 364-365.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kennedy discusses school with young Ricky Taggart.jpg|thumb|Kennedy speaks with a youth while touring Bedford–Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, N.Y.]]

During his years as a senator, he helped to start [[Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation|a successful redevelopment project]] in poverty-stricken [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/nyregion/thecity/01disp.html?_r=0|title=Star Power, Still Shining 40 Years On|date=January 29, 2009|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlesinger wrote that Kennedy had hoped Bedford-Stuyvesant would become an example of self-imposed growth for other impoverished neighborhoods. Kennedy had difficulty securing support from President Johnson, whose administration was charged by Kennedy as having opposed a "special impact" program meant to bring about the federal progress that he had supported. [[Robert B. Semple Jr.]] repeated similar sentiments in September 1967, writing the Johnson administration was preparing "a concentrated attack" on Robert F. Kennedy's proposal that Semple claimed would "build more and better low-cost housing in the slums through private enterprise." Kennedy confided to journalist [[Jack Newfield]] that while he tried collaborating with the administration through courting its members and compromising with the bill, "They didn't even try to work something out together. To them it's all just politics."&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, p. 789.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also [[Joseph S. Clark's and Robert F. Kennedy's tour of the Mississippi Delta|visited]] the [[Mississippi Delta]] as a member of the Senate committee reviewing the effectiveness of 'War on Poverty' programs, particularly that of the [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ascend.aspeninstitute.org/blog/entry/mississippi-rising-building-two-generation-solutions1|title=Mississippi Rising: Building Two-Generation Solutions|publisher=Aspen Institute | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823140141/http://ascend.aspeninstitute.org/blog/entry/mississippi-rising-building-two-generation-solutions1 | archivedate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marian Wright Edelman]] described Kennedy as "deeply moved and outraged" by the sight of the starving children living in the economically abysmal climate, changing her impression of him from "tough, arrogant, and politically driven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://billmoyers.com/content/what-inspired-robert-f-kennedys-fight-against-hunger/|title=What Inspired Robert F.

Kennedy worked on the [[Senate Labor Committee]] at the time of the [[workers' rights]] activism of [[Cesar Chavez]], [[Dolores Huerta]], and the [[National Farm Workers Association]] (NFWA).&lt;ref&gt;Mills, pp. 339-340.&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of labor leader Walter Reuther, who had previously marched with and provided money to Chavez, Kennedy flew out to [[Delano, California]], to investigate the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/701015405|title=The 100 greatest Americans of the 20th century : a social justice hall of fame|last=1948-|first=Dreier, Peter,|date=2012|publisher=Nation Books|year=|isbn=9781568586816|location=New York|pages=339|oclc=701015405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the first two committee hearings in March 1966 for legislation to amend the [[National Labor Relations Act]] to include farm workers received little attention, Kennedy's attendance at the third hearing brought media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Crusades of Cesar Chavez: A Biography|first=Miriam|last=Pawel|pages=122–123.|year=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Press|isbn= 978-1608197101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Thomas wrote that Kennedy was moved after seeing the conditions of the workers, who he deemed were being taken advantage of.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, pp. 320-321.&lt;/ref&gt; Chavez stressed to Kennedy that migrant workers needed to be recognized as human beings. Kennedy later engaged in an exchange with [[Kern County]] sheriff Leroy Galyen where he criticized the sheriff's deputies for taking photographs of "people on picket lines."&lt;ref&gt;Pawel, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a senator, he was popular among African Americans and other minorities including Native Americans and immigrant groups. He spoke forcefully in favor of what he called the "disaffected",&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; the impoverished,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Politics in the Postwar Sunbelt: Conservative Growth in a Battleground Region|page=127.|first=Sean P.|last=Cunningham|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1107024526}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the excluded",&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby aligning himself with leaders of the civil rights struggle and social justice campaigners, leading the Democratic party in pursuit of a more aggressive agenda to eliminate perceived discrimination on all levels. He supported [[desegregation busing]], integration of all public facilities, the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], and anti-poverty social programs to increase education, offer opportunities for employment, and provide health care for African Americans. Consistent with President Kennedy's [[Alliance for Progress]], he also placed increasing emphasis on human rights as a central focus of U.S. foreign policy.

====Vietnam====
The JFK administration had backed U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world in the frame of the Cold War, but Kennedy was not known to be involved in discussions on the [[Vietnam War]] when he was his brother's attorney general.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (2002) [1978], p. 727.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilty, p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]], before choosing to run for the Senate, Kennedy had sought an ambassadorship to [[South Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Robert F. Kennedy|first=Steven K.|last=Schneider|page=72.|year=2001| publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0595137015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entering the Senate, Kennedy initially kept private his disagreements with President Johnson on the war. While Kennedy vigorously supported his brother's earlier efforts, he never publicly advocated commitment of ground troops. Though bothered by the beginning of the bombing of [[North Vietnam]] in February 1965, Kennedy did not wish to appear antipathetic to the president's agenda.&lt;ref name=Mills359&gt;Mills, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; But by April, Kennedy was advocating a halt to the bombing to Johnson, who acknowledged that Kennedy played a part in influencing his choice to temporarily cease bombing the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy, and the Feud that Defined a Decade|year=1998|page=265.|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn= 978-0393318555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy cautioned Johnson against sending combat troops as early as 1965, but Johnson chose instead to follow the recommendation of the rest of his predecessor's still intact staff of advisers. In July, after Johnson made a large commitment of American ground forces to Vietnam, Kennedy made multiple calls for a settlement through negotiation. The next month, [[John Paul Vann]], a [[lieutenant colonel]] in the [[U.S. Army]], wrote that Kennedy "indicat[ed] comprehension of the problems we face", in a letter to the senator.&lt;ref&gt;Palmero, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Senator Robert F. Kennedy and President Lyndon B. Johnson - NARA - 192487.tif|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Senator Robert F. Kennedy and President Lyndon B. Johnson in the [[Oval Office]], 1966]]

In April 1966, Kennedy had a private meeting with [[Philip Heymann]] of the [[United States Department of State|State Department's]] Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs to discuss efforts to secure the release of American prisoners of war in Vietnam. Kennedy wanted to press the Johnson administration to do more, but Heymann insisted that the administration believed the "consequences of sitting down with the Viet Cong" mattered more than the prisoners they were holding captive.&lt;ref&gt;Palmero, pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 29 of that year, Kennedy released a statement disavowing President Johnson's choice to bomb [[Haiphong]], but he avoided criticizing either the war or the president's overall foreign policy, believing that it might harm Democratic candidates in the 1966 [[midterm election]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Palmero, pp. 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' described Kennedy's popularity as outpacing President Johnson's, crediting Kennedy's attempts to end the Vietnam conflict which the public increasingly desired.&lt;ref name=NYTAugust2016&gt;{{cite news|url=https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/08/22/1966-surging-popularity-for-kennedy/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FKennedy%2C%20Robert%20Francis|

In the early part of 1967, Kennedy traveled to Europe, where he had discussions about Vietnam with leaders and diplomats. A story leaked to the State Department that Kennedy was talking about seeking peace while President Johnson was pursuing the war. Johnson became convinced that Kennedy was undermining his authority. He voiced this during a meeting with Kennedy, who reiterated the interest of the European leaders to pause the bombing while going forward with negotiations; Johnson declined to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2009/10/no-vietnam-secrets-between-rfk-lbj-028465|title=No Vietnam secrets between RFK, LBJ|date=October 20, 2009|publisher=POLITICO | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823205944/http://www.politico.com/story/2009/10/no-vietnam-secrets-between-rfk-lbj-028465 | archivedate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, Kennedy outlined a three-point plan to end the war which included suspending the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam, and the eventual withdrawal of American and North Vietnamese soldiers from South Vietnam; this plan was rejected by [[Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]], who believed North Vietnam would never agree to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/kennedy-proposes-plan-to-end-the-war|title=Kennedy proposes plan to end the war|date=March 2, 1967 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823210124/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/kennedy-proposes-plan-to-end-the-war | archivedate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 15, Kennedy debated [[Governor of California]] [[Ronald Reagan]] about the war.&lt;ref&gt;Sabato, p.340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/220949/great-forgotten-debate-paul-kengor|date=May 22, 2007|publisher=National Review|title=The Great Forgotten Debate|first=Paul|last=Kengor }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 26, 1967, during an appearance on ''[[Face the Nation]]'', Kennedy asserted that the Johnson administration had deviated from his brother's policies in Vietnam, his first time contrasting the two administrations' policies on the war. He added that the view that Americans were fighting to end communism in Vietnam was "immoral".&lt;ref&gt;Shesol, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 1968, Kennedy delivered an address in [[Chicago, Illinois]], where he critiqued [[Saigon]] "government corruption" and expressed his disagreement with the Johnson administration's stance that the war would determine the future of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1968/02/08/Kennedy-urges-compromise-in-Vietnam/3841557748231/|title=Kennedy urges compromise in Vietnam|date=February 8, 1968|publisher=upi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 14, Kennedy met with defense secretary [[Clark Clifford]] at the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] regarding the war. Clifford's notes indicate that Kennedy was offering not to enter the ongoing Democratic presidential primary if President Johnson would admit publicly to having been wrong in his war policy and appoint "a group of persons to conduct a study in depth of the issues and come up with a recommended course of action";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kennedy Half-Century: The Presidency, Assassination, and Lasting Legacy|pages=291–292.|first=Larry J.|last=Sabato| year=2014|isbn=978-1620402825|publisher=Bloomsbury USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson rejected the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Hilty, p. 614.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, after President Johnson halted bombing of North Vietnam, RFK said the decision was a "step toward peace" and though offering to collaborate with Johnson for national unity, opted to continue his presidential bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1968/04/02/page/2/article/bobby-calls-lbjs-move-a-step-to-peace|title=Bobby Calls LBJ's Move A Step To Peace|date=April 1, 1968|first=Joseph|last=Zullo|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, while in [[Lafayette, Indiana]], Kennedy said continued delays in beginning peace talks with North Vietnam meant both more lives lost and the postponing of the "domestic progress" hoped for by the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1968/05/02/page/12/article/kennedy-loses-ohio-senators-backing|title= Kennedy Loses Ohio Senator's Backing|date=May 2, 1968|publisher=Chicago Tribune|first=Russell|last=Freeburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Kennedy called the war "the gravest kind of error" in a speech in Corvallis, Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/02/newly-digitized-footage-reveals-an-rfk-speech-one-week-before-his-assassination/283971/|title=Newly Digitized Footage Reveals an RFK Speech One Week Before His Assassination|date=February 20, 2014|publisher=theatlantic.com|first=Rebecca J.|last=Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on June 4, hours before he was shot, Kennedy continued to advocate for a change in policy towards the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/video/nbc-news/24949903#24949903|title=In RFK's final hours, an interview|date=June 4, 1968|publisher=NBC News | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823210807/http://www.nbcnews.com/video/nbc-news/24949903 | archivedate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his criticism of the Vietnam War and the South Vietnam government, Kennedy also stated in his 1968 campaign brochure that he did not support either a simple withdrawal or a surrender in South Vietnam and favored instead a change in the course of action taken so it would bring an "honorable peace."&lt;ref name=uoooav&gt;[http://www.4president.org/brochures/rfk1968brochure.htm Robert F.

In 1968, President Johnson prepared to run for re-election. In January, faced with what was widely considered an unrealistic race against an incumbent president, Kennedy stated that he would not seek the presidency.&lt;ref name="The Last Good Campaign"&gt;{{cite web |year=2008 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/06/rfk_excerpt200806 |title=The Last Good Campaign |author=Thurston Clark |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|editor=The Last Campaign: Robert F.

Kennedy traveled to [[Delano, California]], to meet with civil rights activist [[César Chávez]], who was on a 25-day hunger strike showing his commitment to [[nonviolence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rfk/peopleevents/p_chavez.html | title =People &amp; Events: Cesar Chavez (1927–1993) | publisher =pbs.org | date =August 1, 2004 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823212306/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rfk/peopleevents/p_chavez.html | archivedate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on this visit to California that Kennedy decided he would challenge Johnson for the presidency, telling his former Justice Department aides, [[Edwin Guthman]] and [[Peter Edelman]], that his first step was to get lesser-known Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] of Minnesota to drop out of the presidential race.&lt;ref name="Thurston, 2008"&gt;{{cite book |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=87A0ZdEeWzoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thurston+clarke#v=onepage&amp;q=mccarthy&amp;f=false |author=Thurston Clarke |publisher=Henry Holt|title=The Last Campaign: Robert F.

The weekend before the New Hampshire primary, Kennedy announced to several aides that he would attempt to persuade McCarthy to withdraw from the race to avoid splitting the antiwar vote, but Senator [[George McGovern]] urged Kennedy to wait until after that primary to announce his candidacy.&lt;ref name="The Last Good Campaign"/&gt; Johnson won a narrow victory in the New Hampshire primary on March 12, 1968, against McCarthy, but this close second-place result dramatically boosted McCarthy's standing in the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mccarthy-does-well-in-the-democratic-primary | title =McCarthy does well in the Democratic primary | publisher =history.com | date =March 12, 1968 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823212553/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mccarthy-does-well-in-the-democratic-primary | archivedate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After much speculation, and reports leaking out about his plans,&lt;ref name="decides"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10911F83E541A7493C4A81788D85F4C8685F9 | title=Kennedy decides to run; will discuss plans today| location=paid archive| last=Witkin|first=Richard|date=March 16, 1968|work=The New York Times|pages=1, 14|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seeing in McCarthy's success that Johnson's hold on the job was not as strong as originally thought, Kennedy declared his candidacy on March 16, 1968, in the Caucus Room of the old Senate office building, the same room where his brother had declared his own candidacy eight years earlier.&lt;ref name="caucus"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB071EF73F541B7B93C5A81788D85F4C8685F9 |title=Scene is the Same, But 8 Years Later – Kennedy Brothers Declared for Race in Same Room |last=Herbers |first=John |date= March 17, 1968|work=The New York Times | location=paid archive| page=68 |accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated, "I do not run for the presidency merely to oppose any man, but to propose new policies.

McCarthy supporters angrily denounced Kennedy as an opportunist. They believed that McCarthy had taken the most courageous stand by opposing the sitting president of his own party and that his surprising result in New Hampshire had earned him the mantle of being the anti-war candidate.

Kennedy ran on a platform of racial and economic justice, non-aggression in foreign policy, decentralization of power, and social change. A crucial element of his campaign was an engagement with the young, whom he identified as being the future of a reinvigorated American society based on partnership and equality. His policy objectives did not sit well with the business community, where he was viewed as something of a fiscal liability, opposed as they were to the tax increases necessary to fund social programs. At one of his university speeches (Indiana University Medical School), he was asked, "Where are we going to get the money to pay for all these new programs you're proposing?" He replied to the medical students, about to enter lucrative careers, "From you."&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newfield, Jack. (1988) [1969]. Robert Kennedy: A Memoir. Plume&lt;/ref&gt;

It was this intense and frank mode of dialogue with which he was to continue to engage those whom he viewed as not being traditional allies of Democratic ideals or initiatives. In a speech at the University of Alabama, he argued, "I believe that any who seek high office this year must go before all Americans, not just those who agree with them, but also those who disagree, recognizing that it is not just our supporters, not just those who vote for us, but all Americans who we must lead in the difficult years ahead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://acumen.lib.ua.edu/u0008_0000001_0000013 | title =Emphasis (1968), Robert F. Kennedy, who discusses America at the crossroads | author =Robert F. Kennedy | publisher =University of Alabama | year =1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; He aroused rabid animosity in some quarters, with J. Edgar Hoover's Deputy [[Clyde Tolson]] reported as saying, "I hope that someone shoots and kills the son of a bitch."&lt;ref&gt;Clyde Tolson, qu. in: Thurston Clarke, 'The Last Good Campaign', Vanity Fair, No. 574, June 2008, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy's presidential campaign brought out both "great enthusiasm" and anger in people. His message of change raised hope for some and brought fear to others. Kennedy wanted to be a bridge across the divide of American society. His bid for the presidency saw not only a continuation of the programs he and his brother had undertaken during the president's term in office, but also an extension of Johnson's Great Society.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger 2002 1978, p. xvi"&gt;Schlesinger (2002) [1978], p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy visited numerous small towns and made himself available to the masses by participating in long motorcades and street-corner stump speeches, often in troubled inner cities. He made urban poverty a chief concern of his campaign, which in part led to enormous crowds that would attend his events in poor urban areas or rural parts of [[Appalachia]].&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (2002) [1978], pp. 863, 864, 882, 883.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination==
{{Main|Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy}}
Kennedy scored a major victory when he won the California primary. He addressed his supporters shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, in a [[ballroom]] at [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|The Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name="NYTjune61968"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/06/05/archives/kennedy-claims-victory-and-then-shots-ring-out.html|title=Kennedy claims victory; and then shots ring out|last=Morriss|first=John G.|date=June 6, 1968|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving the ballroom, he went through the hotel kitchen after being told it was a shortcut to a press room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taraborrelli |first=J.

===Burial===
{{main|Grave of Robert F. Kennedy}}
Kennedy was buried close to his brother John in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia, just across the [[Potomac River]] from Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="1968 Year In Review UPI.com"/&gt; Although he had always maintained that he wished to be buried in Massachusetts, his family believed Robert should be interred in Arlington next to his brother.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 19; Barnes, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; The procession left Union Station and passed the [[Dirksen Senate Office Building|New Senate Office Building]], where he had his offices, and then proceeded to the [[Lincoln Memorial]], where it paused. The [[Marine Corps Band]] played ''[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]''.&lt;ref name="Wicker" /&gt; The funeral motorcade arrived at the cemetery at 10:24&amp;nbsp;p.m. As the vehicles entered the cemetery, people lining the roadway spontaneously lit candles to guide the motorcade to the burial site.&lt;ref name="Wicker" /&gt;

The 15-minute ceremony began at 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Patrick O'Boyle]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington|Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington]], officiated at the graveside service in lieu of Cardinal [[Richard Cushing]] of Boston, who fell ill during the trip.&lt;ref name="ReedThousands"/&gt; Also officiating was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Archbishop of New York]] [[Terence Cooke]].&lt;ref name="Wicker" /&gt; On behalf of the United States, [[John Glenn]] presented the folded flag to Senator Ted Kennedy, who passed it to Robert's eldest son, Joe, who passed it to Ethel Kennedy. The [[United States Navy Band|Navy Band]] played ''[[Eternal Father, Strong to Save|The Navy Hymn]]''.&lt;ref name="Wicker" /&gt;

Officials at Arlington National Cemetery said that Kennedy's burial was the only night burial to have taken place at the cemetery.&lt;ref name="Night burial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/visitor_information/Robert_F_Kennedy.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000829150136/http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/visitor_information/Robert_F_Kennedy.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 29, 2000 |title=Robert F.

==Personal life==

===Family===
[[File:Kennedy bros.jpg|thumb|The Kennedy brothers. Presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]], Bobby, and Ted, July 1960]]
On June 17, 1950, Kennedy married socialite [[Ethel Kennedy|Ethel Skakel]], the third daughter of businessman [[George Skakel|George]] and Ann Skakel (née Brannack), at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Greenwich, Connecticut. The couple had 11 children; [[Kathleen Kennedy Townsend|Kathleen]] (b. 1951), [[Joseph P. Kennedy II|Joseph]] (b. 1952), [[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.|Robert Jr.]] (b. 1954), [[David A. Kennedy|David]] (1955–1984), [[Courtney Kennedy Hill|Courtney]] (b. 1956), [[Michael LeMoyne Kennedy|Michael]] (1958–1997), [[Kerry Kennedy|Kerry]] (b. 1959), [[Christopher G. Kennedy|Christopher]] (b. 1963), [[Max Kennedy|Max]] (b. 1965), [[Douglas Harriman Kennedy|Douglas]] (b. 1967), and [[Rory Kennedy|Rory]] (b. December 1968, after her father's assassination).&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"/&gt;

Kennedy owned a home at the well-known [[Kennedy compound]] on [[Cape Cod]], in [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]], but spent most of his time at his estate in [[McLean, Virginia]], known as [[Hickory Hill (McLean, Virginia)|Hickory Hill]], located west of Washington, D.C. His widow, Ethel, and their children continued to live at Hickory Hill after his death. She now lives full-time at the Hyannis Port home.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Attitudes and approach===
Kennedy was said to be the gentlest and shyest of the family, as well as the least articulate orally.&lt;ref name=Schlesinger21-23 /&gt; By the time he was a young boy, his grandmother, Josie Fitzgerald, worried he would become a "sissy". His mother had a similar concern,&lt;ref name=Thomas30 /&gt; as he was the "smallest and thinnest", but soon afterward, the family discovered "there was no fear of that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1120.html|title=Robert Francis Kennedy: Attorney General, Senator and Heir of the New Frontier|first=Alden|last=Whitman|date=June 6, 1968 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824125625/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1120.html | archivedate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family friend [[Lem Billings]] met Kennedy when he was 8 years old and would later reflect that he loved him, adding that Kennedy "was the nicest little boy I ever met".&lt;ref name=Schlesinger21-23 /&gt; Billings also said Kennedy was barely noticed "in the early days, but that's because he didn't bother anybody".&lt;ref name=Hilty15-16 /&gt; Luella Hennessey, who became the nurse for the Kennedy children when Kennedy was 12, called him "the most thoughtful and considerate" of his siblings.&lt;ref name=Schlesinger21-23&gt;Schlesinger, pp. 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy was teased by his siblings, as in their family it was a norm for humor to be displayed in that fashion. He would turn jokes on himself or remain silent.&lt;ref name=Thomas30&gt;Thomas, pp. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his gentle demeanor, he could be outspoken, and once engaged a priest in a public argument that horrified his mother, who later conceded that he had been correct all along. Even when arguing for a noble cause, his comments could have "a cutting quality".&lt;ref&gt;Hilty, pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Joe Kennedy's most ambitious dreams centered around Bobby's older brothers, Bobby maintained the code of personal loyalty that seemed to infuse the life of his family. His competitiveness was admired by his father and elder brothers, while his loyalty bound them more affectionately close.

A rather timid child, he was often the target of his father's dominating temperament. Working on the campaigns of older brother John, he was more involved, passionate, and tenacious than the candidate himself, obsessed with detail, fighting out every battle, and taking workers to task. He had always been closer to John than the other members of the family.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"/&gt;

Kennedy's opponents on [[Capitol Hill]] maintained that his collegiate magnanimity was sometimes hindered by a tenacious and somewhat impatient manner. His professional life was dominated by the same attitudes that governed his family life: a certainty that good humor and leisure must be balanced by service and accomplishment. Schlesinger comments that Kennedy could be both the most ruthlessly diligent and yet generously adaptable of politicians, at once both temperamental and forgiving. In this he was very much his father's son, lacking truly lasting emotional independence, and yet possessing a great desire to contribute. He lacked the innate self-confidence of his contemporaries yet found a greater self-assurance in the experience of married life, an experience that he stated had given him a base of self-belief from which to continue his efforts in the public arena.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"/&gt;

Upon hearing yet again the assertion that he was "ruthless", Kennedy once joked to a reporter, "If I find out who has called me ruthless I will destroy him." He also confessed to possessing a bad temper that required self-control: "My biggest problem as counsel is to keep my temper. I think we all feel that when a witness comes before the United States Senate, he has an obligation to speak frankly and tell the truth. To see people sit in front of us and lie and evade makes me boil inside. But you can't lose your temper; if you do, the witness has gotten the best of you."&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorney Michael O'Donnell wrote, "[Kennedy] offered that most intoxicating of political aphrodisiacs: authenticity. He was blunt to a fault, and his favorite campaign activity was arguing with college students. To many, his idealistic opportunism was irresistible."

&lt;blockquote&gt;In his earlier life, Kennedy had developed a reputation as the family's attack dog.  He was a hostile cross-examiner on Joseph McCarthy's Senate committee; a fixer and leg-breaker as JFK's campaign manager; an unforgiving and merciless cutthroat—his father's son right down to Joseph Kennedy's purported observation that "he hates like me."  Yet Bobby Kennedy somehow became a liberal icon, an antiwar visionary who tried to outflank Lyndon Johnson's Great Society from the left.&lt;ref name="o'donnell"&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Thug Became a Dove|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-thug-became-a-dove-1497042993|author=O'Donnell, Michael|date=June 9, 2017|publisher=''Wall Street Journal''|page=C7}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Thug Became a Dove|url=http://www.michael-odonnell.com/how-the-thug-became-a-dove/|author=O'Donnell, Michael|date=June 10, 2017|publisher=michael-odonnell.com|access-date=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Religious faith and Greek philosophy===
Kennedy's Catholicism was central to his politics and personal attitude to life and its purpose; he inherited his faith from his family. He was more religious than his brothers&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"/&gt; and approached his duties with a Catholic [[worldview]].

Throughout his life, he made reference to his faith, how it informed every area of his life, and how it gave him the strength to re-enter politics following his older brother's assassination. His was not an unresponsive and staid faith, but the faith of a Catholic Radical, perhaps the first successful Catholic Radical in American political history.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, p. 191 Cf. Murray Kempton, ''The Progressive'', September 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last years of his life, he also found great solace in the playwrights and poets of ancient Greece, especially the writings of [[Aeschylus]],&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"/&gt; suggested to him by Jacqueline after JFK's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Robert Kennedy: His Life|first=Evan|last=Thomas |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2013|page=22.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his Indianapolis speech on April 4, 1968, following the assassination of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], Kennedy slightly misquoted these lines from Aeschylus:

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="Kennedy's approach to national problems did not fit neatly into the idealogical categories of his time...His was a muscular liberalism, committed to an activist federal government but deeply suspicious of concentrated power and certain that fundamental change would best be achieved at the community level, insistent on responsibilities as well as rights, and convinced that the dynamism of capitalism could be the impetus for broadening national growth."|source=[[Edwin O.

In the months and years after Robert F. Kennedy's death, numerous roads, public schools, and other facilities across the United States have been named in his memory.

The [[Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights]] was founded in 1968, with an international award program to recognize human rights activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rfkcenter.org/robert-f-kennedy/ |title=Robert F.

In 1998, the [[United States Mint]] released a special dollar coin that featured his image on the obverse and the emblems of the [[United States Department of Justice]] and the [[United States Senate]] on the reverse.

On November 20, 2001, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] and Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] dedicated the Department of Justice headquarters building in Washington, D.C., as the [[Robert F.

===Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.===

Several public institutions jointly honor Kennedy and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]
* In 1969, the former Woodrow Wilson Junior College, a two-year institution and a constituent campus of the [[City Colleges of Chicago]], was renamed [[Kennedy–King College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-woodrow-wilson-western-avenue-chicago-flashback-per-1228-jm-20141226-story.html|title=Woodrow Wilson Road didn't go far|date=December 26, 2014|publisher=Chicago Tribune |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824183230/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-woodrow-wilson-western-avenue-chicago-flashback-per-1228-jm-20141226-story.html |archivedate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1994, the City of Indianapolis erected the ''[[Landmark for Peace Memorial]]'' in Robert Kennedy's honor near the space made famous by [[Robert F. Kennedy's speech on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|his speech from the back of a pickup truck the night King died]]. The monument in Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park depicts a sculpture of RFK reaching out from a large metal slab to a sculpture of King, who is part of a similar slab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landmark for Peace: A tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy|url=http://www.in.gov/visitindiana/blog/index.php/2011/01/14/landmark-for-peace-a-tribute-to-dr-martin-luther-king-and-robert-kennedy/|date=January 14, 2011|last=Nwiltrout|publisher=Indiana Office of Tourism Development|accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is meant to symbolize their attempts in life to bridge the gaps between the races—an attempt that united them even in death.

'''Verna Elisha Howard''' (September 29, 1911&amp;nbsp;– September 28, 2000), known as '''V.&amp;nbsp;E. Howard''', was an [[United States|American]] minister and [[radio]] [[Evangelicalism|evangelist]] based in [[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]], [[Texas]], who founded the ''International Gospel Hour''.

==Family background==

Howard was the second of seven children born in the Rocky Branch community near [[Farmerville, Louisiana|Farmerville]] in [[Union Parish, Louisiana|Union Parish]] in [[North Louisiana]], to a [[Church of Christ]] couple, Elisha John "Hardy" Howard (1889-1974) and the former Corinne Smith (1888-1971). Two of his younger brothers, [[W. L. "Jack" Howard]] and [[Alton Hardy Howard]], were the co-founders in 1946 of Howard Brothers Jewelry and in 1959 the [[chain store]], [[Howard Brothers Discount Stores]], based in [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], where Jack Howard was the [[mayor]] from 1956 to 1972 and 1976 to 1978. V. E. Howard was also an original partner of Howard Jewelers. The youngest of the Howard siblings, Kelton Leroy Howard (1928-1994), died exactly two weeks after the passing of former Mayor Jack Howard. The Howard brothers had two sisters, Euphra Irene Howard Terry (1914-1980) and Cassyle Duvonne Howard McMurry (1918-1989).&lt;ref name=cemetery&gt;{{cite web|url=http://la-cemeteries.com/Transcriptions/Union/RockyBranchGenealogyPage1.htm|title=Rocky Branch Cemetery records|publisher=la-cemeteries.com|accessdate=July 12, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504172836/http://la-cemeteries.com/Transcriptions/Union/RockyBranchGenealogyPage1.htm|archivedate=May 4, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, 1931, Howard married Ruth Moryne Jackson (1909-2000) in [[Corsicana, Texas|Corsicana]] in central Texas.&lt;ref name=cemetery/&gt; There are three Howard children, Jasper Smith Howard, Vernon Edgar Howard, and Marilyn Kay Howard.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therestorationmovement.com/_states/louisiana/howard,ve.htm|title=Verna Elisha Howard (1911-2000)|publisher=therestorationmovement.com|accessdate=July 30, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731224250/http://www.therestorationmovement.com/_states/louisiana/howard,ve.htm|archivedate=July 31, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry==

Howard attended [[Abilene Christian College]] in [[Abilene, Texas]], [[Harding University|Harding College]] in [[Searcy, Arkansas]], and what is now [[Arkansas State University]] in [[Jonesboro, Arkansas]]. In a preaching career of a half-century, he was based in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] and [[Conway, Arkansas]], and [[Greenville, Texas]] and [[Texarkana, Texas]]. His longest tenure was at the Walnut Street Church of Christ in Texarkana.&lt;ref&gt;''Preachers of Today'', Vol. 5, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard preached via radio for forty-six years. He was known for the question, "Are you listening?" which he used to emphasize important points or Scriptures in his lessons. His sermon entitled, "What Is The Church of Christ?" brought what is considered possibly the greatest response ever to a religious broadcast in radio history. He mailed more than 75,000 free copies of this particular sermon. Howard, at the age of eighty-four in 1995, on the advice of his physicians, transferred the ''International Gospel Hour'' to the West Fayetteville Church of Christ in [[Fayetteville, Tennessee|Fayetteville]] in [[Lincoln County, Tennessee|Lincoln County]] in southern [[Tennessee]], under the minister Winford Claiborne.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Howard led [[Revival meeting|revival]] meetings in twenty states and [[Baptism|baptized]] some eight thousand converts. Howard penned eighteen Christian books and more than fifty tracts. He was the president of the Central Printers and Publishers Company and Howard Foundations, Inc. Like his brother, Alton, V. E. Howard published a Christian hymnal;  V. E. Howard's "Gospel Songs and Hymns'' has 870 selections.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Howard died in Texarkana some eight months after the passing of his wife. His saying "Are You Listening?", from his book ''35 Years, Are You Listening?'' is inscribed on their gravestone at the Rocky Branch Cemetery in Union Parish.&lt;ref name=cemetery/&gt;

Wallace Skipper, a Howard associate, summarized the evangelist's career:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He was a valiant and energetic individual. In addition to being a successful businessman, he was a very able speaker, preacher, and gifted writer. It has been said "the search for truth is the noblest occupation of man, its publication a duty."&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Working Lunch''''' was a [[television programme]] broadcast on [[BBC Two]] which covered [[business]], [[personal finance]] and [[consumer]] news between 1994 and 2010. The programme was first aired on 19 September 1994. It had a quirky, relaxed style, especially when compared to other [[BBC]] business shows such as ''[[World Business Report]]''. In April 2010, the BBC announced that the programme was being cancelled at the end of July 2010. ''[[GMT (TV series)|GMT]]'' with [[George Alagiah]] took its place in the schedule at 12:30 on BBC Two.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8640504.stm BBC's Working Lunch show to end] BBC News, 23 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8871800.stm Goodbye message from Working Lunch] BBC News, 30 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graphics==
The original title sequence created by Piers Helm, featured a real goldfish and a rubber shark in a tank that contained the programme's subject matter represented as [[kitsch]] fish tank objects. These objects were a treasure chest, bank, factory and a version of the [[Richard Rogers]] [[Lloyds building]]. The title sequence led to a virtual set that was designed to look like a converted warehouse when in fact, the studio it came from was the smallest BBC News studio. By 2000, the title sequence had been changed by BBC Design to a computer generated sequence in which a goldfish is trying to escape from a shark on board a sunken ship. The programme graphics also reflected this style with a marine-themed studio background. Other graphics were in a "crude [[clipart]]" style.

==2008 relaunch==
The show was relaunched on 6 October 2008, with new titles, set and presenters. The familiar goldfish and shark were replaced by a piggy bank. Presenters [[Paddy O'Connell]], [[Adam Shaw (journalist)|Adam Shaw]] and Nik Wood, were replaced by [[Declan Curry]] and [[Naga Munchetty]], the latter joining from [[Bloomberg TV]]. The new format was unpopular with viewers and the vast majority of comments about it were negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=(Press release statement) | title= New presenter line-up as Working Lunch relaunches | date=17 July 2008  | publisher= BBC Press Office | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/07_july/17/working_lunch.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= BBC axes Working Lunch | publisher=Guardian News and Media|work=guardian.co.uk. | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/apr/23/bbc-axes-working-lunch | date = 23 April 2010 | first=James | last=Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Points of view|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/mbpointsofview/F1951566?thread=5962144| accessdate=23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presenters and reporters==
Originally, the show was presented by [[Adrian Chiles]] and [[Adam Shaw (journalist)|Adam Shaw]]. Chiles left the programme on 26 January 2007 after twelve-and-a-half-years, to become the co-host of the [[BBC One]] current affairs and lifestyle programme ''[[The One Show]]''. He was replaced by Nik Wood. On Fridays, [[Paddy O'Connell]] fronted the show with Shaw instead of Wood. Both O'Connell and Shaw bowed out on 26 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/working_lunch/5155118.stm Nik Wood] BBC News, 19 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, former footballer [[Graeme Le Saux]] presented a series of items recorded in his birthplace of [[Jersey]]. Jenny Culshaw, a senior producer on the show, also occasionally presented items.

Other members of the Working Lunch team included [[Rachel Burden]], Simon Gompertz, Rachel Horne, Rob Pittam and Gillian Lacey-Solymar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/working_lunch/5155268.stm Gillian Lacey-Solymar] BBC News, 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/working_lunch/5155214.stm Simon Gompertz] BBC News, 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/working_lunch/5155436.stm Rachel Horne] BBC News, 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/working_lunch/5155396.stm Rob Pittam] BBC News, 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 6 October 2008, a revamped lineup saw ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'''s former business presenter, [[Declan Curry]], and [[Naga Munchetty]] take over studio presentation, with Wood returning to his former role of roving reporter, alongside Rob Pittam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/working_lunch/7641491.stm Why we're off air this week ] BBC News, 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gillian Lacey-Solymar left the show on 29 January 2010.

The show had a regular cast of experts like [[Justin Urquhart Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/working_lunch/1458405.stm|title=''A couple of things before you invest....'' - BBC Working Lunch p.16 August 2001|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast schedule==
[[Image:Working Lunch 1.png|thumb|right|The former Goldfish programme titles.]]
The show had a regular weekday slot at 12.30{{nbsp}}pm until 1{{nbsp}}pm, except on Wednesdays when it was broadcast an hour later. The programme was broadcast for 42 weeks of the year, taking a break for [[Easter]], [[Christmas]] and some sports tournaments coverage, such as [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], the [[Olympic Games]] and [[golf]].

'''Zang Toi''' (born 11 June 1961) is a [[Malaysia]]n [[designer]].

==Early life==
He was born in the [[Kuala Krai]] district in the state of [[Kelantan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bio|url=http://www.houseoftoi.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=15&amp;phpMyAdmin=2cfe790f2f39b6d5648b3acbc1a559d0|work=House of Toi|accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 11 June 1961.
Toi left his native [[Malaysia]] at the age of eighteen, and via Toronto, landed in [[New York City]] a year later. There he attended [[Parsons The New School for Design|Parsons School of Design]] and apprenticed with [[Mary Jane Marcasiano]] and [[Ronaldus Shamask]]. In 1989, with a modest collection of bright sarongs, strong suits and regal dresses, he opened his own atelier.

==Achievements==
In 1991 Toi won the Mouton-Cadet Young Designers Award, surprising many considering the competition he faced that day. His most recent award of distinction was presented by [[New York City Public Advocate]] [[Mark J. Green]] for Toi’s artistic contributions and achievements. In March 1997, Toi was awarded a knighthood by the Sultan of Kelantan. Mr. Toi is also a recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence.

In 2013 he was awarded the title of [[Datuk]] by the King of Malaysia.&lt;ref name="ThestarStory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/6/1/nation/20130601174344&amp;sec=nation|title=Zang Toi: Datukship an acknowledgement of my hard work|publisher=The Star Online|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Toi has served several style arbiters including [[Sharon Stone]], [[Patti LaBelle]], [[Ivana Trump]], [[Hazelle Goodman]], [[Kelly Preston]], [[Kirstie Alley]], [[Jennifer Tilly]], Jill Zarin, [[Meg Ryan]], and [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]] from [[The Black Eyed Peas]]. Be it the House of Toi signature collection or the "Z" collection, his moderately priced bridge line, Toi’s creations are marketed as original and feminine pieces.

Zang Toi is available in globally fine stores including the Couture Department at [[Nordstrom]], fine specialty boutiques and Zang Toi Boutiques in Malaysia.

Zang Toi launched his new line of fine makeup with [[Amazingcosmetics]] at his Spring 2013 runway show.&lt;ref name="ibtimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/379544/20120831/zang-toi-spring-2012-fashion-week-photos.htm|title=Zang Toi Gives A Sneak Peek Into His Spring 2013 Collection Ahead of New York Fashion Week &amp;#91;PHOTOS&amp;#93;|publisher=ibtimes.com|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==
In most of his fashion shows, Toi has employed the services of another famous Malaysian, [[Ling Tan]], whose career he helped to kick-start.
