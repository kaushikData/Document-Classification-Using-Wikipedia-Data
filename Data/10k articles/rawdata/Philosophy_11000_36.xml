'''''A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain''''' is a philosophical pamphlet by [[Benjamin Franklin]], published in [[London]] in 1725 in response to ''The Religion of Nature Delineated''.

It argues that an omnipotent, benevolent God is incompatible with notions of human free will and morality. The second portion of the pamphlet goes on to formulate that all motivations are derived from pain and that pain is met with an equal amount of pleasure. He then concludes that this means that man cannot be superior to animals because we are all equal in God’s eyes. Franklin acknowledges how offensive this idea would be to the reader, and refuted it later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Papers of Benjamin Franklin|pages=57-71|edition=I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The point of the pamphlet seems to be that Christian [[Calvinism]], which Franklin was raised with as a child but turned against in teenage years as a [[Deism|Deist]], cannot logically be a moral way to live.

In 1779, Franklin came to disagree with the points he printed in ''Dissertation'' and burned all the copies he possessed of the pamphlet but one for historical purposes. However, since he had already come to give several copies to friends of his, four original copies still survive. They are in the possession of the British Museum, Library of Congress, John Carter Brown Library, and Yale University Library.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin, and Leonard Woods Labaree.

'''Apocryphon''' ("secret writing"), plural [[apocrypha]], was a Greek term for a [[genre]] of [[Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Early Christian]] writings that were meant to impart "secret teachings" or [[gnosis]] (knowledge) that could not be publicly taught. Such private instruction to the apostles figures in the canonical [[Gospel]]s of the [[New Testament]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[Messianic secret]] and [[Gnosticism and the New Testament]].&lt;/ref&gt; and furnishes the material of the "sayings" ''[[Gospel of Thomas]]'' and part of the material of the ''[[Gospel of Mary]]''. It is purportedly a secret teaching supposedly committed to a trusted disciple by Christ after his resurrection. The secret teaching in Gnostic literature refers to several things.&lt;ref&gt;Kripal, Jeffrey,'' The Serpent's Gift''. The University of Chicago Press: Chicago, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples &lt;!--that have their own entries or need to--&gt; include:
*[[Genesis Apocryphon]], from the [[Qumran]] [[The Qumran Caves|caves]]
*''[[Secret Gospel of Mark]]'' (''Apocryphon of Mark'')
*''[[Apocryphon of James]]'' (''Secret Book of James''), in the [[Nag Hammadi library]]
*''[[Apocryphon of John]]'' (''Secret Book of John''), in the Nag Hammadi library

&lt;!-- "Astrology" is an uncountable noun, and it is used as such throughout the lead. It is not meant to suggest a connection between unrelated astrological systems (eg. Chinese and Mayan), each of which could be referred to as "astrology". --&gt;
'''Astrology''' is the study of the movements and relative positions of [[celestial objects]] as a means of [[divination|divining]] information about human affairs and terrestrial events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Oxford University Press| title = astrology| encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionary of English| accessdate = 11 December 2015| url = https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/astrology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Merriam-Webster Inc.| title = astrology| encyclopedia = Merriam-Webster Dictionary| accessdate = 11 December 2015| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astrology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |first1=Nicholas |last1=Bunnin |first2=Jiyuan |last2=Yu |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2008 |p=57 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LdbxabeToQYC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=dictionary+philosophy+astrology#v=onepage&amp;q=dictionary%20philosophy%20astrology&amp;f=false|isbn=9780470997215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in [[Calendrical calculation|calendrical]] systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications.&lt;ref name="Koch-Westenholz 1995 Foreword, 11"&gt;{{cite book |last=Koch-Westenholz |first=Ulla |title=Mesopotamian astrology: an introduction to Babylonian and Assyrian celestial divination |year=1995 |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |location=Copenhagen |isbn=978-87-7289-287-0 |pages=Foreword, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some – such as the [[Hindu astrology|Indians]], [[Chinese astrology|Chinese]], and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] – developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations.

From a 15th-century Welsh manuscript]]

Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and the [[Hindu astrology|Indians]], [[Chinese astrology|Chinese]], and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. In the West, astrology most often consists of a system of [[horoscope]]s purporting to explain aspects of a person's [[personality]] and predict future events in their life based on the positions of the sun, moon, and other celestial objects at the time of their birth. The majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;{{rp|83}}

Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium [[BCE]], with roots in [[Calendrical calculation|calendrical]] systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications.&lt;ref name="Koch-Westenholz 1995 Foreword, 11"/&gt; A form of astrology was practised in the first dynasty of [[Mesopotamia]] (1950–1651 BCE). Chinese astrology was elaborated in the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BCE). [[Hellenistic astrology]] after 332 BCE mixed [[Babylonian astrology]] with Egyptian [[Decans|Decanic astrology]] in [[Alexandria]], creating [[horoscopic astrology]]. [[Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's]] conquest of [[Asia]] allowed astrology to spread to [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. In Rome, astrology was associated with '[[Chaldea]]n wisdom'. After the conquest of Alexandria in the 7th century, astrology was taken up by Islamic scholars, and Hellenistic texts were translated into Arabic and Persian. In the 12th century, Arabic texts were imported to Europe and [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]]. Major astronomers including [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo]] practised as court astrologers. Astrological references appear in literature in the works of poets such as [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], and of playwrights such as [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[William Shakespeare]].

Throughout most of its history, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition. It was accepted in political and academic contexts, and was connected with other studies, such as [[astronomy]], [[alchemy]], [[meteorology]], and medicine.&lt;ref name="Kassell"/&gt; At the end of the 17th century, new scientific concepts in astronomy and physics (such as [[heliocentrism]] and [[classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]]) called astrology into question. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in astrology has largely declined.&lt;ref name="Brit"/&gt;

Scattered evidence suggests that the oldest known astrological references are copies of texts made in the ancient world. The [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]] is thought to be compiled in [[Babylon]] around 1700 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Hobson, ''THE EXACT TRANSMISSION OF TEXTS IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM B.C.E.'', Published PhD Thesis. Department of Hebrew, Biblical and Jewish Studies. University of Sydney. 2009 [http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/5404/1/r-hobson-2009-thesis.pdf PDF File]&lt;/ref&gt;  A scroll documenting an early use of [[electional astrology]] is doubtfully ascribed to the reign of the [[Sumer]]ian ruler [[Gudea of Lagash]] (c. 2144 – 2124 BCE). This describes how the gods revealed to him in a dream the constellations that would be most favourable for the planned construction of a temple.&lt;ref&gt;From scroll A of the ruler Gudea of Lagash, I 17 – VI 13. O. Kaiser, ''Texte aus der Umwelt des Alten Testaments'', Bd. 2, 1–3. Gütersloh, 1986–1991. Also quoted in A. Falkenstein, 'Wahrsagung in der sumerischen Überlieferung', ''La divination en Mésopotamie ancienne et dans les régions voisines''. Paris, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is controversy about whether these were genuinely recorded at the time or merely ascribed to ancient rulers by posterity. The oldest undisputed evidence of the use of astrology as an integrated system of knowledge is therefore attributed to the records of the first dynasty of [[Mesopotamia]] (1950–1651 BCE). This astrology had some parallels with [[Hellenistic]] Greek (western) astrology, including the zodiac, a norming point near 9 degrees in Aries, the trine aspect, planetary exaltations, and the dodekatemoria (the twelve divisions of 30 degrees each).&lt;ref name="Rochberg-Halton"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Elements of the Babylonian Contribution to Hellenistic Astrology | author=Rochberg-Halton, F. | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | year=1988 | volume=108 | issue=1 | pages=51–62 | jstor=603245 | doi=10.2307/603245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Babylonians viewed celestial events as possible signs rather than as causes of physical events.&lt;ref name="Rochberg-Halton"/&gt;

The system of [[Chinese astrology]] was elaborated during the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BCE) and flourished during the [[Han Dynasty]] (2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE), during which all the familiar elements of traditional Chinese culture – the Yin-Yang philosophy, theory of the five elements, Heaven and Earth, Confucian morality – were brought together to formalise the philosophical principles of Chinese medicine and divination, astrology and alchemy.&lt;ref name=Kistemaker /&gt;{{rp|3,4}}

==== Ancient objections ====

[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|upright|The Roman orator [[Cicero]] objected to astrology]]

[[Cicero]] stated the twins objection (that with close birth times, personal outcomes can be very different), later developed by [[Saint Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that since the other planets are much more distant from the earth than the moon, they could have only very tiny influence compared to the moon's.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. pp.&amp;nbsp;173–174.&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that if astrology explains everything about a person's fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or the effects of the weather on people.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] argued that since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on human affairs should depend on their position with respect to the zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of its surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Favorinus]] argued that it was absurd to imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies in the same way as they affect the tides,&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates. [[Sextus Empiricus]] argued that it was absurd to link human attributes with myths about the signs of the zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carneades]] argued that belief in fate denies [[free will]] and [[morality]]; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Lament, Death, and Destiny | publisher=Peter Lang | author=Hughes, Richard | year=2004 | page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hellenistic Egypt ===
{{Main article|Hellenistic astrology}}

[[File:Quadritpartitum.jpg|thumb|upright|1484 copy of first page of [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy's]] ''Tetrabiblos'', translated into Latin by [[Plato of Tivoli]]|alt=Ptolemy's ''Tetrabiblos'', the Hellenistic text that founded Western astrology]]
In 525 BCE, [[Egypt]] was conquered by the Persians. The 1st century BCE Egyptian [[Dendera Zodiac]] shares two signs – the Balance and the Scorpion – with Mesopotamian astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the occupation by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BCE, Egypt became [[Hellenistic]]. The city of [[Alexandria]] was founded by Alexander after the conquest, becoming the place where [[Babylonian astrology]] was mixed with Egyptian [[Decans|Decanic astrology]] to create [[Horoscopic astrology]]. This contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary [[exaltation (astrology)|exaltation]]s, the triplicities of the signs and the importance of eclipses. It used the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, and the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and [[four elements]].&lt;ref&gt;Holden, 1996. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–13.&lt;/ref&gt; 2nd century BCE texts predict positions of planets in zodiac signs at the time of the rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[astrologer]] and astronomer [[Ptolemy#Astrology|Ptolemy]] lived in Alexandria. Ptolemy's work the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'' formed the basis of Western astrology, and, "...enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more."&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, 1940. 'Introduction' p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece and Rome ===

The conquest of [[Asia]] by [[Alexander the Great]] exposed the Greeks to ideas from [[Syria]], Babylon, Persia and central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Campion, 2008. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 280 BCE, [[Berossus]], a priest of [[Marduk|Bel]] from Babylon, moved to the Greek island of [[Kos]], teaching astrology and Babylonian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Campion, 2008. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1st century BCE, there were two varieties of astrology, one using [[horoscope]]s to describe the past, present and future; the other, [[theurgic]], emphasising the [[soul|soul's]] ascent to the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Campion, 2008. pp.&amp;nbsp;173–174.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek influence played a crucial role in the transmission of astrological theory to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref name=B32&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first definite reference to astrology in Rome comes from the orator [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], who in 160 BCE warned farm overseers against consulting with Chaldeans,&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p.&amp;nbsp;32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; who were described as Babylonian 'star-gazers'.&lt;ref name=Campion227&gt;Campion, 2008. pp.&amp;nbsp;227–228.&lt;/ref&gt; Among both Greeks and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], Babylonia (also known as [[Chaldea]]) became so identified with astrology that 'Chaldean wisdom' became [[synonym]]ous with [[divination]] using planets and stars.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, 1983. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2nd-century Roman poet and satirist [[Juvenal]] complains about the pervasive influence of Chaldeans, saying, "Still more trusted are the Chaldaeans; every word uttered by the astrologer they will believe has come from [[Jupiter (mythology)|Hammon's]] fountain."&lt;ref&gt;[[Juvenal]], Satire 6: ''[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/juvenal_satires_06.htm The Ways of Women]'' (translated by G. G. Ramsay, 1918, retrieved 5 July 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first astrologers to bring [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] astrology to Rome was [[Thrasyllus of Mendes|Thrasyllus]], astrologer to the [[emperor]] [[Tiberius]],&lt;ref name="B32"/&gt; the first emperor to have had a court astrologer,&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; though his predecessor [[Augustus]] had used astrology to help legitimise his [[Imperialism|Imperial]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main texts upon which classical Indian astrology is based are early medieval compilations, notably the ''[[Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra|{{IAST|Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra}}]]'', and ''[[Sārāvalī]]'' by {{IAST|Kalyāṇavarma}}.
The ''Horāshastra'' is a composite work of 71 chapters, of which the first part  (chapters 1–51) dates to the 7th to early 8th centuries and the second part (chapters 52–71) to the later 8th century. The ''Sārāvalī'' likewise dates to around 800 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Pingree]], ''{{IAST|Jyotiḥśāstra}}'' (J. Gonda (Ed.)

[[File:Isidor von Sevilla.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|The medieval theologian [[Isidore of Seville]] criticised the predictive part of astrology]]

In the seventh century, [[Isidore of Seville]] argued in his ''[[Etymologiae]]'' that astronomy described the movements of the heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific, describing the movements of the sun, the moon and the stars, while the other, making predictions, was theologically erroneous.&lt;ref name=Wood5&gt;Wood, 1970. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Isidore&gt;{{cite book | title=Etymologiae | author=Isidore of Seville | year=c. 600 | pages=L, 82, col. 170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[John Gower]] in the fourteenth century defined astrology as essentially limited to the making of predictions.&lt;ref name=Wood5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=3197718&amp;pageno=9 | title=Confessio Amantis | author=Gower, John | year=1390 | pages=VII, 670–84 | quote=Assembled with Astronomie / Is ek that ilke Astrologie / The which in juggementz acompteth / Theffect, what every sterre amonteth, / And hou thei causen many a wonder / To tho climatz that stonde hem under.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the stars was in turn divided into natural astrology, with for example effects on tides and the growth of plants, and judicial astrology, with supposedly predictable effects on people.&lt;ref name=Wood6&gt;Wood, 1970. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen148&gt;{{cite book | title=Star-crossed Renaissance | publisher=Duke University Press | author=Allen, Don Cameron | year=1941 | page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourteenth century sceptic [[Nicole Oresme]] however included astronomy as a part of astrology in his ''Livre de divinacions''.&lt;ref name=Wood8&gt;Wood, 1970. pp. 8–11&lt;/ref&gt; Oresme argued that current approaches to prediction of events such as plagues, wars, and weather were inappropriate, but that such prediction was a valid field of inquiry.

== Principles and practice ==
Advocates have defined astrology as a symbolic language, an [[art]] form, a [[science]], and a method of divination.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica,' v.5, 1974, p. 916&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, Thomas: 'The Origin of Culture and Civilization,'' Phenix &amp; Phenix Literary Publicists, 2005, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; Though most cultural astrology systems share common roots in ancient philosophies that influenced each other, many use methods that differ from those in the West. These include Hindu astrology (also known as "Indian astrology" and in modern times referred to as "Vedic astrology") and Chinese astrology, both of which have influenced the world's cultural history.

=== Western ===
[[Western astrology]] is a form of [[divination]] based on the construction of a [[horoscope]] for an exact moment, such as a person's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Philip P. Wiener |title=Dictionary of the history of ideas |year=1974 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-13293-8 |url=http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaBook/tei/DicHist1.xml;brand=default;}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the tropical zodiac, which is aligned to the [[Equinox|equinoctial points]].&lt;ref&gt;James R. Lewis, 2003. ''The Astrology Book: the Encyclopedia of Heavenly Influences''. Visible Ink Press. Online at Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Western astrology is founded on the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon and planets, which are analysed by their movement through [[Astrological sign|signs]] of the [[zodiac]] (twelve spatial divisions of the [[ecliptic]]) and by their [[Astrological aspect|aspects]] (based on geometric angles) relative to one another. They are also considered by their placement in [[House (astrology)|houses]] (twelve spatial divisions of the sky).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hone |first=Margaret |title=The Modern Text-Book of Astrology |year=1978 |publisher=L. N. Fowler |location=Romford |isbn=978-0-85243-357-7 |pages=21–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astrology's modern representation in western popular media is usually reduced to [[sun sign astrology]], which considers only the zodiac sign of the Sun at an individual's date of birth, and represents only 1/12 of the total chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Riske |first=Kris |title=Llewellyn's Complete Book of Astrology |year=2007 |publisher=Llewellyn Publications |location=Minnesota, USA |isbn=978-0-7387-1071-6 |pages=5–6; 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The horoscope visually expresses the set of relationships for the time and place of the chosen event. These relationships are between the seven 'planets', signifying tendencies such as war and love; the twelve signs of the zodiac; and the twelve houses. Each planet is in a particular sign and a particular house at the chosen time, when observed from the chosen place, creating two kinds of relationship.&lt;ref name=Kremer&gt;{{cite journal | title=Horoscopes and History. by J. D. North; A History of Western Astrology. by S. J. Tester | author=Kremer, Richard | journal=Speculum | year=1990 | volume=65 | issue=1 | pages=206–209 | jstor=2864524 | doi=10.2307/2864524}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third kind is the aspect of each planet to every other planet, where for example two planets 120° apart (in 'trine') are in a harmonious relationship, but two planets 90° apart ('square') are in a conflicted relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pelletier, Robert |author2=Cataldo, Leonard | title=Be Your Own Astrologer | pages=57–60 | publisher=Pan | year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Fenton, Sasha | title=Rising Signs | pages=137–9 | publisher =Aquarian Press | year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these relationships and their interpretations supposedly form  "...the language of the heavens speaking to learned men."&lt;ref name=Kremer/&gt;

Along with [[tarot divination]], astrology is one of the core studies of [[Western esotericism]], and as such has influenced systems of [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] belief not only among Western esotericists and [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]], but also belief systems such as [[Wicca]] that have borrowed from or been influenced by the Western esoteric tradition. [[Tanya Luhrmann]] has said that "all magicians know something about astrology," and refers to a [[table of correspondences]] in [[Starhawk|Starhawk's]] ''[[The Spiral Dance]]'', organised by [[planets in astrology|planet]], as an example of the astrological lore studied by magicians.&lt;ref name="Luhrmann"&gt;{{cite book | title=Persuasions of the witch's craft: ritual magic in contemporary England | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Luhrmann, Tanya | year=1991 | pages=147–151 | isbn=978-0-674-66324-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese and East-Asian ===
{{Details|Chinese zodiac}}
[[Chinese astrology]] has a close relation with [[Chinese philosophy]] (theory of the three harmonies: heaven, earth and man) and uses concepts such as [[yin and yang]], the [[Wu Xing|Five phases]], the 10 [[Celestial stem]]s, the 12 [[Earthly Branches]], and [[Chinese units of measurement|shichen]] (時辰 a form of timekeeping used for religious purposes). The early use of Chinese astrology was mainly confined to [[History of astrology|political astrology]], the observation of unusual phenomena, identification of [[Omen|portent]]s and the selection of auspicious days for events and decisions.&lt;ref name=Kistemaker&gt;{{cite book | first=Sun, Xiaochun | title=The Chinese sky during the Han: constellating stars and society | journal=The Chinese Sky During the Han: Constellating Stars and Society | year=1997 | publisher=Brill | location=Leiden | isbn=978-90-04-10737-3 | author=Kistemaker, Jacob| bibcode=1997csdh.book.....S }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22,85,176}}

The constellations of the Zodiac of western Asia and Europe were not used; instead the sky is divided into [[Chinese constellations|Three Enclosures]] (三垣 sān yuán), and [[Twenty-Eight Mansions]] (二十八宿 èrshíbā xiù) in twelve Ci ([[:zh:分野|十二次]]).&lt;ref&gt;F.

It is based on cycles of years, lunar months, and two-hour periods of the day (the shichen).

== Theological viewpoints ==
{{see also|Christian views on astrology|Jewish views on astrology|Muslim views on astrology}}

=== Ancient ===
[[St. Augustine]] (354{{ndash}}430) believed that the determinism of astrology conflicted with the Christian doctrines of man's free will and responsibility, and God not being the cause of evil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Magic and Divination at the Courts of Burgundy and France: Text and Context of Laurens Pignon's "Contre les Devineurs" (1411) | publisher=Brill | author=Veenstra, J.R. | year=1997 | isbn=978-90-04-10925-4|pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he also grounded his opposition philosophically, citing the failure of astrology to explain twins who behave differently although conceived at the same moment and born at approximately the same time.&lt;ref name=Hess&gt;{{cite book |last=Hess |first=Peter M.J. |title=Catholicism and science |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood |location=Westport |isbn=978-0-313-33190-9 |page=11 |edition=1st |author2=Allen, Paul L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval ===
[[File:Avicenna.jpg|thumb|upright|A drawing of Avicenna]]
Some of the practices of astrology were contested on theological grounds by medieval Muslim astronomers such as [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius), [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) and [[Avicenna]]. They said that the methods of astrologers conflicted with orthodox religious views of [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]], by suggesting that the Will of God can be known and predicted in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Saliba |first=George | authorlink=George Saliba | year=1994b | title=A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam | publisher=[[New York University Press]] | isbn=978-0-8147-8023-7 | pages=60, 67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Avicenna's 'Refutation against astrology', ''Risāla fī ibṭāl aḥkām al-nojūm'', argues against the practice of astrology while supporting the principle that planets may act as agents of divine causation. Avicenna considered that the movement of the planets influenced life on earth in a deterministic way, but argued against the possibility of determining the exact influence of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Catarina Belo, Catarina Carriço Marques de Moura Belo, ''Chance and determinism in Avicenna and Averroës'', p. 228. Brill, 2007. {{ISBN|90-04-15587-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, Avicenna did not deny the core dogma of astrology, but denied our ability to understand it to the extent that precise and fatalistic predictions could be made from it.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Saliba]], ''Avicenna'': 'viii. Mathematics and Physical Sciences'. Encyclopædia Iranica, Online Edition, 2011, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-viii&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] (1292–1350), in his ''Miftah Dar al-SaCadah'', also used [[physics|physical]] arguments in astronomy to question the practice of judicial astrology.&lt;ref name=Livingston&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah: A Fourteenth Century Defense against Astrological Divination and Alchemical Transmutation | first=John W. | last=Livingston | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | volume=91 | issue=1 | year=1971 | pages=96–103 | doi=10.2307/600445| jstor=600445}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recognised that the [[star]]s are much larger than the [[planet]]s, and argued: &lt;blockquote&gt;And if you astrologers answer that it is precisely because of this distance and smallness that their influences are negligible, then why is it that you claim a great influence for the smallest heavenly body, Mercury? Why is it that you have given an influence to al-Ra's and [[al-Dhanab]], which are two imaginary points [ascending and descending nodes]?&lt;ref name=Livingston/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Maimonides]], the preeminent Jewish philosopher, astronomer, and legal codifier, wrote that astrology is forbidden by Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Avodat Kochavim 11:9&lt;/ref&gt;

Named after the 19th-century showman Phileas T.

=== Demarcation ===

Under the criterion of [[falsifiability]], first proposed by the [[philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]], astrology is a pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=PopperStanford&gt;{{cite web |authors=Stephen Thornton, Edward N. Zalta (older edition)|title=Karl Popper|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper regarded astrology as "pseudo-empirical" in that "it appeals to observation and experiment," but "nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards."&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |last=Popper |first=Karl |title=Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-28594-0 |edition=Reprinted‌}}

In contrast to Popper, the philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Peter |title=Astrology and Science in Seventeenth-Century England |journal=Social Studies of Science |year=1975 |pages=399–422 | doi = 10.1177/030631277500500402 |pmid=11610221 |volume=5|issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|401}} Kuhn thought that, though astrologers had, historically, made predictions that categorically failed, this in itself does not make astrology unscientific, nor do attempts by astrologers to explain away failures by claiming that creating a horoscope is very difficult. Rather, in Kuhn's eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to [[medieval medicine]]; astrologers followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,&lt;ref name=Kuhn /&gt;{{rp|8}} and so "they had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise."&lt;ref name=Wright /&gt;{{rp|401;}}&lt;ref name=Kuhn&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|title=Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science [held at Bedford College, Regent's Park, London, from July 11th to 17th 1965] |year=1970 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-09623-2 |edition=Reprint |editor=[[Imre Lakatos]] |editor2=[[Alan Musgrave]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} While an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological [[hypothesis]] in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.&lt;ref name=Kuhn /&gt;{{rp|8}}

The philosopher [[Paul Thagard]] asserts that astrology cannot be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|228}} To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience is that the state-of-the-art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be "selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations."&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|227–228}} Progress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|228}}&lt;ref name=Hurley /&gt;{{rp|549}} To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in [[normal science]] believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the "many unsolved problems," and in the face of better alternative theories (psychology). For these reasons Thagard views astrology as pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurley&gt;{{cite book |last=Hurley|first=Patrick|title=A concise introduction to logic |year=2005 |publisher=Wadsworth |location=Belmont, Calif.|isbn=978-0-534-58505-1|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|228}}

For the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.&lt;ref name=EdwardJ /&gt;{{rp|34}}

{{quote|What if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierarchy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the effiacacy of explanation and so on? In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational.&amp;nbsp;... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning."|Edward W.

=== Effectiveness ===

Astrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in [[Experiment|controlled studies]] and has no scientific validity.&lt;ref name="Cosmic"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jeffrey Bennett |author2=Megan Donohue |author3=Nicholas Schneider |author4=Mark Voit |title=The cosmic perspective |year=2007 |publisher=Pearson/Addison-Wesley |location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-8053-9283-8 |pages=82–84 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85;}}&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt; Where it has made [[falsifiable]] predictions under [[Scientific control|controlled conditions]], they have been falsified.&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt;{{rp|424}} One famous experiment included 28 astrologers who were asked to match over a hundred natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the [[California Psychological Inventory]] (CPI) questionnaire.&lt;ref name=Muller&gt;{{cite web|last=Muller |first=Richard |title=Web site of Richard A.

In 1955, the astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that though he had failed to find evidence that supported indicators like [[Astrological signs|zodiacal signs]] and [[Astrological aspects|planetary aspects]] in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the [[Diurnal motion|diurnal positions]] of some [[Planets in astrology|planets]] and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets.&lt;ref name=Pont&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pont |first=Graham |title=Philosophy and Science of Music in Ancient Greece |journal=Nexus Network Journal |year=2004 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=17–29 |doi=10.1007/s00004-004-0003-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gauquelin-1955"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gauquelin |first=Michel |title=L'influence des astres: étude critique et expérimentale |year=1955 |publisher=Éditions du Dauphin |location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the [[natal chart]]s of successful athletes and became known as the ''[[Mars effect]]''.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll|first=Robert Todd|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions |year=2003 |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=978-0-471-27242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213}} A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence.&lt;ref name=Carroll /&gt;{{rp|213–214}} They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.&lt;ref name=Benski&gt;{{cite book |last=Benski |first=Claude|others=with a commentary by [[Jan Willem Nienhuys]] |title=The "Mars Effect: A French Test of over 1,000 Sports Champions |year=1995 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, NY |isbn=978-0-87975-988-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession.  The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs. The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations, where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information.&lt;ref name=CritThink/&gt;{{rp|116}}

Dean, a scientist and former astrologer, and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large scale scientific test that involved more than one hundred [[cognitive]], [[behavioural]], [[physiology|physical]], and other variables—but found no support for astrology.&lt;ref name=FailToPredict&gt;{{cite news |last=Matthews |first=Robert |title=Astrologers fail to predict proof they are wrong |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1439101/Astrologers-fail-to-predict-proof-they-are-wrong.html |accessdate=13 July 2012 |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=17 August 2003 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geoffrey /&gt; Furthermore, a [[meta-analysis]] pooled 40 studies that involved 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests—which involved 300 participants—had the astrologers pick the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results suggested there was any preferred chart.&lt;ref name=Geoffrey&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is Astrology Relevant to Consciousness and Psi? |author=Dean G. |author2=Kelly, I. W. |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |year=2003 |volume=10 |issue=6–7 |pages=175–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|190}}

=== Lack of mechanisms and consistency ===

Testing the validity of astrology can be difficult, because there is no consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict.&lt;ref name=Cosmic /&gt;{{rp|83}} Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.&lt;ref name="Cosmic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eysenck1982"/&gt;{{rp|83}}

Many astrologers claim that astrology is scientific,&lt;ref name=ChrisFrench&gt;{{cite news |last=Chris |first=French |title=Astrologers and other inhabitants of parallel universes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/07/astrologers-parallel-universes |publisher=The Guardian |work=7 February 2012 |accessdate=8 July 2012 |location=London |date=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some have proposed conventional [[Causality|causal agent]]s such as [[electromagnetism]] and [[gravity]].&lt;ref name=ChrisFrench/&gt; Scientists reject these mechanisms as implausible&lt;ref name=ChrisFrench /&gt; since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances.&lt;ref name=Shermer&gt;{{cite book |last=editor |first=Michael Shermer |title=The Skeptic encyclopedia of pseudoscience |year=2002 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, California |isbn=978-1-57607-653-8 |page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western astrology has taken the earth's [[Precession#Axial precession (precession of the equinoxes)|axial precession (also called precession of the equinoxes)]] into account since Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'', so the 'first point of Aries', the start of the astrological year, continually moves against the background of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Tester, 1999. Page 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated [[Astrological sign|sign]], astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations.&lt;ref name=Charpak /&gt; Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being "...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars."&lt;ref name=Charpak/&gt; Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the [[Age of Aquarius]], which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt;

Astrologers usually have only a small knowledge of astronomy, and often do not take into account basic principles—such as the precession of the equinoxes, which changes the position of the sun with time. They commented on the example of [[Élizabeth Teissier]], who claimed that, "The sun ends up in the same place in the sky on the same date each year," as the basis for claims that two people with the same birthday, but a number of years apart, should be under the same planetary influence. Charpak and Broch noted that, "There is a difference of about twenty-two thousand miles between Earth's location on any specific date in two successive years," and that thus they should not be under the same influence according to astrology. Over a 40 years period there would be a difference greater than 780,000 miles.&lt;ref name=Charpak&gt;{{cite book |last=Charpak |first=Georges |title=Debunked!: ESP, telekinesis, and other pseudoscience |journal=Physics Today |volume=58 |issue=5 |year=2004 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=978-0-8018-7867-1 |author2=Holland, Henri Broch |others=translated by Bart K. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpnWcMzeh8oC&amp;q=astrology#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=6, 7|bibcode=2005PhT....58e..67C |doi=10.1063/1.1995751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western politics and society ===

In the West, political leaders have sometimes consulted astrologers. For example, the British intelligence agency [[MI5]] employed [[Louis de Wohl]] as an astrologer after claims surfaced that [[Adolf Hitler]] used astrology to time his actions. The War Office was "...interested to know what Hitler's own astrologers would be telling him from week to week."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JrdVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5bADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6779,6948658&amp;dq=hitler-astrologer&amp;hl=en | title=The Strange Story Of Britain's "State Seer" | publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=30 August 1952 | accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, de Wohl's predictions were so inaccurate that he was soon labelled a "complete charlatan," and later evidence showed that Hitler considered astrology "complete nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/mar/04/nationalarchives.secondworldwar | title=Star turn: astrologer who became SOE's secret weapon against Hitler | publisher=The Guardian | date=4 March 2008 | accessdate=21 July 2012 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[John Hinckley|John Hinckley's]] [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|attempted assassination]] of US President [[Ronald Reagan]], first lady [[Nancy Reagan]] commissioned astrologer [[Joan Quigley]] to act as the secret White House astrologer.

There was a boom in interest in astrology in the late 1960s. The sociologist [[Marcello Truzzi]] described three levels of involvement of "Astrology-believers" to account for its revived popularity in the face of scientific discrediting. He found that most astrology-believers did not claim it was a scientific explanation with predictive power. Instead, those superficially involved, knowing "next to nothing" about astrology's 'mechanics', read newspaper astrology columns, and could benefit from "tension-management of anxieties" and "a cognitive belief-system that transcends science."&lt;ref name=Truzzi&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Occult Revival as Popular Culture: Some Random Observations on the Old and the Nouveau Witch | author=Truzzi, Marcello | journal=The Sociological Quarterly | year=1972 | volume=13 | issue=1 | pages=16–36 | jstor=4105818 | doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1972.tb02101.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those at the second level usually had their horoscopes cast and sought advice and predictions. They were much younger than those at the first level, and could benefit from knowledge of the language of astrology and the resulting ability to belong to a coherent and exclusive group. Those at the third level were highly involved and usually cast horoscopes for themselves. Astrology provided this small minority of astrology-believers with a "''meaningful'' view of their universe and [gave] them an ''understanding'' of their place in it."{{efn|Italics in original.}} This third group took astrology seriously, possibly as a ''sacred canopy'', whereas the other two groups took it playfully and irreverently.&lt;ref name=Truzzi/&gt;

In 1953, the sociologist [[Theodor W.

On February 2011, the [[Bombay High Court]] reaffirmed astrology's standing in India when it dismissed a case that challenged its status as a science.&lt;ref&gt;'Astrology is a science: Bombay HC', [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Astrology-is-a-science-Bombay-HC/articleshow/7418795.cms The Times of India], 3 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], strong belief in astrology has led to dramatic changes in the fertility rate and the number of abortions in the years of ''Fire Horse''. Adherents believe that women born in [[Bingwu|''hinoeuma'']] years are unmarriageable and bring bad luck to their father or husband. In 1966, the number of babies born in Japan dropped by over 25% as parents tried to avoid the stigma of having a daughter born in the hinoeuma year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=1bTGN21ev2MC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=hinoeuma | title=Japanese childrearing: two generations of scholarship | year=1996 | accessdate=22 July 2012| isbn=9781572300811 | last1=Shwalb | first1=David W. | last2=Shwalb | first2=Barbara J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=uAOrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=hinoeuma | title=The Political Economy of Japan: Cultural and social dynamics | year=1992 | accessdate=22 July 2012| isbn=9780804719919 | last1=Kumon | first1=Shumpei | last2=Rosovsky | first2=Henry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woman in the Moon.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Title page of [[John Lyly|John Lyly's]] astrological play, ''The Woman in the Moon'', 1597]]

The fourteenth-century English poets [[John Gower]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] both referred to astrology in their works, including Gower's ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' and Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;ref name=Wedel/&gt; Chaucer commented explicitly on astrology in his ''Treatise on the Astrolabe'', demonstrating personal knowledge of one area, judicial astrology, with an account of how to find the ascendant or rising sign.&lt;ref name=WoodAstrolabe&gt;Wood, 1970. pp.12–21&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fifteenth century, references to astrology, such as with [[simile]]s, became "a matter of course" in English literature.&lt;ref name=Wedel&gt;{{cite book | title=Mediæval Attitude Toward Astrology, Particularly in England | publisher=Kessinger | author=Wedel, Theodore Otto | year=2003 | origyear=1920 | pages=131–156 | chapter=9: Astrology in Gower and Chaucer | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9lVQVyb9M4C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=%22Confessio+Amantis%22+Gower+astrology#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Confessio%20Amantis%22%20Gower%20astrology&amp;f=false | quote=The literary interest in astrology, which had been on the increase in England throughout the fourteenth century, culminated in the works of Gower and Chaucer. Although references to astrology were already frequent in the romances of the fourteenth century, these still retained the signs of being foreign importations. It was only in the fifteenth century that astrological similes and embellishments became a matter of course in the literature of England.&lt;br&gt;Such innovations, one must confess, were due far more to Chaucer than to Gower. Gower, too, saw artistic possibilities in the new astrological learning, and promptly used these in his retelling of the Alexander legend—but he confined himself, for the most part, to a bald rehearsal of facts and theories. It is, accordingly, as a part of the long encyclopaedia of natural science that he inserted into his ''Confessio Amantis'', and in certain didactic passages of the ''Vox Clamantis'' and the ''Mirour de l'Omme'', that Astrology figures most largely in his works&amp;nbsp;... Gower's sources on the subject of astrology&amp;nbsp;... were Albumasar's ''Introductorium in Astronomiam'', the Pseudo-Aristotelian ''Secretum Secretorum'', Brunetto Latini's ''Trésor'', and the ''Speculum Astronomiae'' ascribed to Albert the Great.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixteenth century, John Lyly's 1597 play, ''The Woman in the Moon'', is wholly motivated by astrology,&lt;ref name=DeLacy&gt;{{cite journal | title=Astrology in the Poetry of Edmund Spenser | author=De Lacy, Hugh | journal=The Journal of English and Germanic Philology |date=October 1934 | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=520–543 | jstor=27703949}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Christopher Marlowe]] makes astrological references in his plays ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' and ''[[Tamburlaine]]'' (both c. 1590),&lt;ref name=DeLacy/&gt; and [[Sir Philip Sidney]] refers to astrology at least four times in his [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] ''[[The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia]]'' (c. 1580).&lt;ref name=DeLacy/&gt; [[Edmund Spenser]] uses astrology both decoratively and causally in his poetry, revealing "...unmistakably an abiding interest in the art, an interest shared by a large number of his contemporaries."&lt;ref name=DeLacy/&gt; [[George Chapman|George Chapman's]] play, ''[[The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron|Byron's Conspiracy]]'' (1608), similarly uses astrology as a causal mechanism in the drama.&lt;ref name=Camden&gt;{{cite journal | title=Astrology in Shakespeare's Day | author=Camden Carroll, Jr. | journal=Isis |date=April 1933 | volume=19 | issue=1 | pages=26–73 | jstor=225186 | doi=10.1086/346721}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] attitude towards astrology is unclear, with contradictory references in plays including ''[[King Lear]]'', ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', and ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''.&lt;ref name=Camden/&gt; Shakespeare was familiar with astrology and made use of his knowledge of astrology in nearly every play he wrote,&lt;ref name=Camden/&gt; assuming a basic familiarity with the subject in his commercial audience.&lt;ref name=Camden/&gt; Outside theatre, the physician and mystic [[Robert Fludd]] practised astrology, as did the quack doctor Simon Forman.&lt;ref name=Camden/&gt; In Elizabethan England, "The usual feeling about astrology&amp;nbsp;...

In seventeenth century Spain, [[Lope de Vega]], with a detailed knowledge of astronomy, wrote plays that ridicule astrology. In his pastoral romance ''La Arcadia'' (1598), it leads to absurdity; in his novela ''Guzman el Bravo'' (1624), he concludes that the stars were made for man, not man for the stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Attitude of Lope de Vega toward Astrology and Astronomy | author=Halstead, Frank G. | journal=Hispanic Review | volume=7 |issue=3 |date=July 1939 |pages=205–219 |jstor=470235 | doi=10.2307/470235}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] wrote the 1641 comedy ''Astrologo Fingido'' (The Pretended Astrologer); the plot was borrowed by the French playwright [[Thomas Corneille]] for his 1651 comedy ''Feint Astrologue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Calderon's Astrologo Fingido in France |author=Steiner, Arpad | journal=Modern Philology | volume=24 |issue=1 |date=August 1926 |pages=27–30 |jstor=433789 | doi=10.1086/387623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous piece of music influenced by astrology is the orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]''. Written by the British composer [[Gustav Holst]] (1874–1934), and first performed in 1918, the framework of ''The Planets'' is based upon the astrological symbolism of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;Campion, Nicholas.:''A History of Western Astrology: Volume II: The Medieval and Modern Worlds''. (Continuum Books, 2009) pp.&amp;nbsp;244–245 {{ISBN|978-1-84725-224-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the seven movements of the suite is based upon a different planet, though the movements are not in the order of the planets from the Sun.

{{Black-box}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}
In science, computing, and engineering, a '''black box''' is a device, system or object which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs (or [[Transfer function|transfer characteristics]]), without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its implementation is "opaque" (black). Almost anything might be referred to as a black box: a [[transistor]], an [[algorithm]], or the [[human brain]].

[[File:Blackbox3D-withGraphs.png|thumb|centre|595x595px|&lt;center&gt;Black box model&lt;/center&gt;]]

To analyse something modeled as an [[open system (systems theory)|open system]], with a typical "black box approach", only  the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) ''box''. The usual representation of this ''black box system''  is a [[data flow diagram]] centered in the box.

The opposite of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic are available for inspection, which is most commonly referred to as a [[white box (software engineering)|white box]] (sometimes also known as a "clear box" or a "glass box"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Holzinger|first=Andreas|last2=Plass|first2=Markus|last3=Holzinger|first3=Katharina|last4=Crisan|first4=Gloria Cerasela|last5=Pintea|first5=Camelia-M.|last6=Palade|first6=Vasile|date=2017-08-03|title=A glass-box interactive machine learning approach for solving NP-hard problems with the human-in-the-loop|eprint=1708.01104|class=cs.AI}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==History==

The modern meaning of the term "black box" seems to have entered the English language around 1945. In electronic [[circuit theory]] the process of [[network synthesis filters|network synthesis]] from [[transfer function]]s, which led to electronic circuits being regarded as "black boxes" characterized by their response to signals applied to their [[Port (circuit theory)|ports]], can be traced to [[Wilhelm Cauer]] who published his ideas in their most developed form in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Cauer, Wilhelm; ''Theorie der linearen Wechselstromschaltungen'', '''Vol.I''', Akademische Verlags-Gesellschaft Becker und Erler, Leipzig, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Cauer did not himself use the term, others who followed him certainly did describe the method as black-box analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Cauer, Emil; Mathis, Wolfgang; and Pauli, Rainer; "Life and Work of Wilhelm Cauer (1900&amp;nbsp;– 1945)", ''Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Symposium of Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS2000)'', p4, Perpignan, June, 2000. [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall03/cs323/links/cauer.pdf Retrieved online] 19 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vitold Belevitch]]&lt;ref&gt;Belevitch, Vitold; "Summary of the history of circuit theory", ''Proceedings of the IRE'', '''vol 50''', Iss 5, pp. 848-855, May 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; puts the concept of black-boxes even earlier, attributing the explicit use of [[two-port network]]s as black boxes to [[Franz Breisig]] in 1921 and argues that 2-terminal components were implicitly treated as black-boxes before that.

In [[cybernetics]], a full treatment was given by [[Ross Ashby]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="ash56"&gt;Ashby, W. Ross; ''An introduction to cybernetics'', London: Chapman &amp; Hall, 1956, chapter 6: ''The black box'', pp. 86{{ndash}}117.&lt;/ref&gt; A black box was described by [[Norbert Wiener]] in 1961 as an unknown system that was to be identified using the techniques of [[system identification]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Norbert; ''Cybernetics: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine'', MIT Press, 1961, {{ISBN|0-262-73009-X}}, page xi&lt;/ref&gt;  He saw the first step in [[Self organization#Self-organization in cybernetics|self-organization]] as being to be able to copy the output behavior of a black box. Many other engineers, scientists and epistemologists, as [[Mario Bunge]],&lt;ref name="Bunge63"/&gt;  used and perfected the black box theory in the 1960s.

The understanding of a ''black box'' is based on the "explanatory principle", the [[hypothesis]] of a [[causal relation]] between the ''input'' and the ''output'', and:&lt;ref name="gla09"&gt;Glanville, Ranulph; "Black Boxes", Cybernetics and Human Knowing, 2009, pp. 153-167.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''input'' and ''output'' being believed to be distinct,
* having observable (and relatable) inputs and outputs,
* being black to the observer (non-openable).

=== Recording of observed states ===
[[File:Hidrograma.png|thumb|252px|The observed [[hydrograph]] is a graphic of the response of a [[Drainage basin|watershed]] (a blackbox) with its [[Surface runoff|runoff]] (red) to an input of rainfall (blue).]]

An observer makes observations over time. All observations of inputs and outputs of a ''black box'' can be written in a table with the form:
{|border="1"
!↓Time
!States of input and output
|-
|...
|... ...
|-
|...
|... ...
|}

in which, at each of a sequence of times, the states of the ''box’s'' various parts, input and output, are recorded. Thus, using an example from [[William Ross Ashby|Ashby]], examining a box that has fallen from a [[flying saucer]] might lead to this protocol:&lt;ref name="ash56" /&gt;

{|border="1"
!↓Time
!States of input and output
|-
|11:18&amp;nbsp;a.m.
|I did nothing—the Box emitted a steady hum at 240&amp;nbsp;Hz.
|-
|11:19
|I pushed over the switch marked K: the note rose to 480&amp;nbsp;Hz and remained steady.
|-
|11:20
|I accidentally pushed the button marked “!”—the Box increased in temperature by 20&amp;nbsp;°C.
|-
|...
|... Etc.
|}
[[File:Blackbox3D-obs.png|thumb|252px|When the observer (an [[Multi-agent system|agent]]) can also do some stimulus (input), the relation with the black box is not only an observation, but an [[experiment]].]]

Thus every system, fundamentally, is investigated by the collection of a long protocol, drawn out in time, showing the sequence of input and output states. From this there follows the fundamental deduction that all knowledge obtainable from a Black Box (of given input and output) is such as can be obtained by re-coding the protocol (the ''observation table''); all that, and nothing more.&lt;ref name="ash56" /&gt;

If the observer also controls input, the investigation turns into an [[experiment]] (illustration), and hypotheses about [[Causality|cause and effect]] can be tested directly.

When the experimenter is also motivated to control the box, there is an active feedback in the box/observer relation, promoting what in [[Control system|control theory]] is called a [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] architecture.

===Modeling ===
The ''modeling process'' is the construction of a predictive [[mathematical model]], using existing historic data (observation table).

=== Testing the black box model===
A developed ''black box model'' is a validated model when ''[[black-box testing]]'' methods&lt;ref name="BS7925"&gt;See for ex. the British standard BS 7925-2 (Software component testing), or its 2001 work draft,&lt;br /&gt;BCS SIGIST (British Computer Society Specialist Interest Group in Software Testing), "Standard for Software Component Testing", Working Draft 3.4, 27 April 2001 [http://www.testingstandards.co.uk/bs_7925-2.htm webpage].&lt;/ref&gt; ensures that it is, based solely on [[Observation#Observation in science|observable]] elements.

With [[backtesting]], inputs for past events (not used in the "modeling effort") are entered into the model to see how well the output matches the known results.

==Other theories==
''Black box theories'' are things defined only in terms of their function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/black-box-theory Definition from Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1O98-blackboxtheory.html definition from highbeam]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''black box theory'' is applied to any field, [[philosophy]] and [[science]] or otherwise where some inquiry or definition is made into the relations between the appearance of something (exterior/outside), i.e. here specifically the thing's black box state, related to its  characteristics and behaviour within (interior/inner).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new-science-theory.com/isaac-newton.html Black box theory applied briefly to Isaac Newton]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 374288 | volume=9 | issue=2 | title=What's inside the black box: a case study of allocative politics in the Hill-Burton program | journal=Int J Health Serv | pages=313–39 | last1 = Feshbach | first1 = D | doi=10.2190/ltd9-c9c7-x1lf-pmnm| year=1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, the inquiry is focused upon a thing that has no immediately apparent characteristics and therefore has only factors for consideration held within itself hidden from immediate observation. The observer is assumed ignorant in the first instance as the majority of available [[data]] is held in an inner situation away from [[wikt:facile|facile]] investigations. The ''black box'' element of the definition is shown as being characterised by a system where observable elements enter a perhaps imaginary box with a set of different outputs emerging which are also observable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/186066 Physics dept, Temple University, Philadelphia]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adoption in humanities ===
In [[Humanities|humanities disciplines]] such as [[philosophy of mind]] and [[behaviorism]], one of the uses of black box theory is to describe and understand [[psychological]] factors in fields such as marketing when applied to an analysis of [[consumer behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcbowles.com/courses/adv_dip/module12/chapter4/amc12_ch4_two.htm Institute for working futures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626014001/http://www.marcbowles.com/courses/adv_dip/module12/chapter4/amc12_ch4_two.htm |date=26 June 2012 }} part of Advanced Diploma in Logistics and Management.

The ''black box theory of [[consciousness]]'' states that the [[mind]] is fully understood once the [[Information|inputs]] and outputs are well-defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.politicsprofessor.com/politicaltheories/black-box-model.php |title=the Professor network |access-date=6 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928220823/http://www.politicsprofessor.com/politicaltheories/black-box-model.php |archive-date=28 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- DROP non-soursed and generally couples this with a [[radical skepticism]] regarding the possibility of ever successfully describing the underlying structure, mechanism, and dynamics of the mind.{{clarify|date=May 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} --&gt;

==Examples==
* In [[computer programming]] and [[software engineering]], ''[[black box testing]]'' is used to check that the output of a program is as expected, given certain inputs.&lt;ref&gt;Beizer, Boris; ''Black-Box Testing: Techniques for Functional Testing of Software and Systems'', 1995, {{ISBN|0-471-12094-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "black box" is used because the actual program being executed is not examined.
* In [[computing]] in general, a ''black box program'' is one where the user cannot see the inner workings (perhaps because it is a [[closed source]] program) or one which has no side effects and the function of which need not be examined, a routine suitable for re-use.
* Also in [[computing]], a black box refers to a piece of equipment provided by a vendor, for the purpose of using that vendor's product. It is often the case that the vendor maintains and supports this equipment, and the company receiving the black box typically is hands-off.
* In [[neural network]]ing or [[heuristic algorithm]]s (computer terms generally used to describe 'learning' computers or 'AI simulations'), a black box is used to describe the constantly changing section of the program environment which cannot easily be tested by the programmers. This is also called a [[White box (software engineering)|white box]] in the context that the program code can be seen, but the code is so complex that it is functionally equivalent to a black box.
* In [[physics]], a black box is a system whose internal structure is unknown, or need not be considered for a particular purpose.
* In [[mathematical model]]ing, a limiting case.
* In [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]], the school of [[behaviorism]] sees the human mind as a black box;&lt;ref name="FriSil06"&gt;"Mind as a Black Box: The Behaviorist Approach", pp. 85-88, in Friedenberg, Jay; and Silverman, Gordon; ''Cognitive Science: An Introduction to the Study of Mind'', Sage Publications, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; see ''[[#Other theories|other theories]]''.
* In [[neorealism in international relations|neorealist]] [[international relations theory]], the [[sovereign state]] is generally considered a black box: states are assumed to be unitary, [[homo economicus|rational, self-interested actors]], and the actual decision-making processes of the state are disregarded as being largely irrelevant. [[Liberalism in international relations|Liberal]] and [[constructivism in international relations|constructivist]] theorists often criticize neorealism for the "black box" model, and refer to much of their work on how states arrive at decisions as "breaking open the black box".
* In [[cryptography]] to capture the notion of knowledge obtained by an algorithm through the execution of a [[cryptographic protocol]] such as a [[zero-knowledge proof]] protocol. If the output of an algorithm when interacting with the protocol matches that of a simulator given some inputs, it 'need not know' anything more than those inputs.

''Black Box theory'' is, however, even wider in application than these professional studies:

{{Quotation|The child who tries to open a door has to manipulate the handle (the input) so as to produce the desired movement at the latch (the output); and he has to learn how to control the one by the other without being able to see the internal mechanism that links them. In our daily lives we are confronted at every turn with systems whose internal mechanisms are not fully open to inspection, and which must be treated by the methods appropriate to the Black Box.|Ashby&lt;ref name="ash56" /&gt;}}

{{Quotation|(...) This simple rule proved very effective and is an illustration of how the Black Box principle in cybernetics can be used to control situations that, if gone into deeply, may seem very complex. &lt;br&gt;A further example of the Black Box principle is the treatment of mental patients. The human brain is certainly a Black Box, and while a great deal of neurological research is going on to understand the mechanism of the brain, progress in treatment is also being made by observing patients' responses to stimuli.|Duckworth, Gear and Lockett&lt;ref&gt;WE Duckworth, AE Gear and AG Lockett (1977), "A Guide to Operational Research". {{DOI|10.1007/978-94-011-6910-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other uses of the term==
* In [[aviation]], the [[flight recorder]] is often called a "black box", especially by the media, although it is usually bright orange to facilitate its discovery after a crash. In an [[airplane]] or [[helicopter]], the flight recorder consists of two independent devices that are usually combined in a single unit. The flight [[data recorder]] logs information about controls and sensors, and the [[cockpit]] voice recorder preserves the most recent sounds in the cockpit, including conversation of the pilots. If an accident happens, investigators can use the recordings to assist in the investigation.
** Similarly, the [[train event recorder]] in [[rail transport]] and the [[voyage data recorder]] in maritime transport are often called "black boxes".
* In [[amateur radio]] the term "black box operator" is a disparaging or self-deprecating description of someone who operates factory-made radios without having a good understanding of how they work. Such operators do not build their own equipment (an activity called "homebrewing") or repair their own "black boxes".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.g3ngd.talktalk.net/1950.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Van Dyck - Charity.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Allegory|Allegorical]] personification of ''Charity'' as a mother with three infants by [[Anthony van Dyck]] ]]

In [[Christian]] [[theology]], '''Charity''' ([[Latin]] '''''Caritas''''') is considered as one of the [[Seven virtues|seven virtues]] and is understood by [[Thomas Aquinas]] as "the friendship of man for God", which "unites us to [[God]]". He holds it as "the most excellent of the [[cardinal virtue|virtues]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3023.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: Charity, considered in itself (Secunda Secundae Partis, Q. 23)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Aquinas holds that "the habit of charity extends not only to the love of God, but also to the love of our neighbor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3025.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The object of charity (Secunda Secundae Partis, Q.25)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines "charity" as "the [[theological virtue]] by which we love God above all things for His own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#448/z|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|author=|date=|website=usccb.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caritas: the altruistic love==
The phrase ''Deus caritas est'' from {{bibleverse|1|John|4:8|4}}—or ''Θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν'' (Theos agapē estin) in the original Greek&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_john/4.htm|title=1 John 4  Interlinear Bible|author=|date=|website=biblehub.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is translated in the King James Version as: "God is love", and in the [[Douay-Rheims]] bible as: "God is charity" ({{bibleverse|1|John|4:8|63}}). Thomas Aquinas does not simply equate charity with "[[Love (religious views)#Christian|love]]", which he holds as a passion, not a virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2026.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The passions of the soul in particular: and first, of love (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 26)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King James Version]] uses both the words ''charity'' and ''love'' to translate the idea of ''caritas''/ἀγάπη (agapē): sometimes it uses one, then sometimes the other, for the same concept.  Most other English translations, both before and since, do not; instead, throughout they use the same more direct English word ''love''.  Love can have other meanings in English, but as used in the [[New Testament]] it almost always refers to the virtue of ''caritas''.

Many times when charity is mentioned in English-language bibles, it refers to "love of God", which is a spiritual love that is extended from God to man and then reflected by man, who is made in the image of God, back to God. God gives man the power to act as God acts (God is love), man then reflects God's power in his own human actions towards others. One example of this movement is "charity shall cover the multitude of sins" ({{bibleverse|1|Peter|4:8|KJV}}). "The practice of charity brings us to act toward ourselves and others out of love alone, precisely because each person has the dignity of a beloved child of God."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osv.com/Article/TabId/493/ArtMID/13569/ArticleID/10360/What-is-Virtue.aspx King, Will. "What is Virtue?", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', November 29, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a theological virtue==
[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Charity (1878).jpg|thumb|upright|''Charity'' by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] ]]

Charity is held to be the ultimate perfection of the human spirit, because it is said to both glorify and reflect the nature of God. Confusion can arise from the multiple meanings of the English word "love".  As other theological virtues, Charity is divinely infused into the soul; it resides in the ''will''.&lt;ref name=sollier&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm Sollier, Joseph. "Love (Theological Virtue)." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 21 Aug. 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Aquinas, charity is an absolute requirement for happiness, which he holds as man's last goal.

Charity has two parts: love of God and love of man, which includes both love of one's neighbor and one's self.&lt;ref name=sollier/&gt;

In [[1 Corinthians 13]], [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] places the greater emphasis on Charity (Love). "So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love." He describes it as:

{{quote|Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become ''as'' sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have ''the gift of'' prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed ''the poor'', and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

Charity never faileth: but whether ''there be'' prophecies, they shall fail; whether ''there be'' tongues, they shall cease; whether ''there be'' knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away....And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these ''is'' charity.}}

The fruits of charity are joy, peace, and mercy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#450/z|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|author=|date=|website=usccb.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] issued the encyclical ''[[Deus caritas est]]'', in which he discussed "... the love which God lavishes upon us and which we in turn must share with others."&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est.html Pope Benedict XVI, ''Deus caritas est'', December 25, 2005, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8250">[[File:Chemoton ATV.svg|thumb|right| Autocatalytic reaction of chemoton]]
The '''chemoton''' is an abstract model for the fundamental unit of life introduced by [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[theoretical biologist]] [[Tibor Gánti]]. It is the oldest known computational abstract of [[protocell]]. Gánti conceived the basic idea in 1952 and formulated the concept in 1971 in his book ''The Principles of Life'' (originally written in Hungarian, and translated to English only in 2003). He surmised the chemoton as the original ancestor of all organisms, or the [[last universal common ancestor]].&lt;ref name=hug&gt;{{cite book| author=Hugues Bersini  |chapter= Minimal cell: the computer scientist's point of view|title= Origins and Evolution of Life: An Astrobiological Perspective|editor=Muriel Gargaud|editor2=Purificación López-Garcìa|editor3=Hervé Martin |year= 2011 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m3oFebknu1cC&amp;dq=chemoton&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |pages= 60–61 | publisher= Cambridge University Press  |isbn= 9781139494595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic assumption of the model is that life should fundamentally and essentially have three properties: [[metabolism]], [[self-replication]], and a [[Cell membrane|bilipid membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Van Segbroeck S, Nowé A, Lenaerts T |title= Stochastic simulation of the chemoton |url= |journal= Artif Life |volume=15 |issue= 2 | pages= 213–226 |year= 2009 |pmid= 19199383|doi= 10.1162/artl.2009.15.2.15203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metabolic and replication functions together form an [[autocatalytic]] subsystem necessary for the basic functions of life, and a membrane encloses this subsystem to separate it from the surrounding environment. Therefore, any system having such properties may be regarded as alive, and it will be subjected to [[natural selection]] and contain a self-sustaining cellular information. Some consider this model a significant contribution to [[origin of life]] as it provides a philosophy of [[Unit of selection|evolutionary units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hoenigsberg HF |title=From geochemistry and biochemistry to prebiotic evolution...we necessarily enter into Gánti's fluid automata  |url= |journal= Genet Mol Res |volume= 6|issue= 2 | pages= 358–373 |year= 2007 |pmid= 17624859|doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property==

Chemoton is a protocell that grows by metabolism, reproduce by biological [[Fission (biology)|fission]], and has at least rudimentary genetic variation. Thus, it contains three subsystems, namely autocatalytic network for metabolism, a lipid bilayer for structural organisation, and a replicating machinery for information. Unlike cellular metabolic reactions, metabolism of chemoton in autonomous chemical cycle and is not dependent on enzymes. Autocatalysis produces its own structures and functions. Hence, the process itself has no hereditary variation. The model reaction however asserts that another molecule (''T'' in the diagram) is spontaneously produced that is incorporated into the structure. This molecule is [[amphipathic]] like [[membrane lipids]], but it is highly dynamic, leaving small gaps that close and open frequently. This unstable structure is important for new amphipathic molecules to be added, so that a membrane is subsequently formed. This will become a microsphere. Due to metabolic reaction, [[osmotic pressure]] will build up inside the microsphere, and this will generate a force for invaginating the membrane, and ultimately division. In fact, this is close to the cell division of cell wall-less bacteria, such as ''[[Mycoplasma]]''. Continuous reactions will also invariably produce variable polymers that can be inherited by daughter cells. In advanced version of the chemoton, the hereditary information will act as a genetic material, something like a [[ribozyme]] of the [[RNA world hypothesis|RNA World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=John Maynard Smith| author2=Eors Szathmary |title= The Major Transitions in Evolution|year=1997 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UGCmIVB5dhMC&amp;dq=chemoton&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |pages= 20–24 | publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=  9780198502944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

===Origin of life===

The primary use of the chemoton model is in the study of the chemical origin of life. Because chemoton itself can be, though in theory, as a primitive or minimal cellular life as it satisfies the definition of what a cell is (that it is a unit of biological activity enclosed by a membrane and capable of self-reproduction). Experimental demonstration showed that a synthesised chemotron can survive in a wide range of chemical solutions, it formed materials for its internal components, it metabolised its chemicals, and it grew in size and multiplied itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Csendes T |title=A Simulation study of the chemotron|url= |journal= Kybernetes |volume=13 |issue= 2 | pages= 79–85 |year= 1984 |pmid= |doi= 10.1108/eb005677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unit of selection===

As it is scientifically hypothesised that the first replicating systems must be simple structure, most likely before any enzymes or templates existed, chemoton provides a plausible scenario. As an autocatalytic but non-genetic entity, it predates the enzyme-dependent precursors of life, such as RNA World. But being capable of self-replication and producing variant metabolites, it possibly could be an entity with the first biological evolution, therefore, the origin of the unit of Darwinian selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Laurent Keller |title= Levels of Selection in Evolution|year= 1999 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5b_iEzNFlBUC&amp;dq=chemoton&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |page= 52 | publisher= Princeton University Press  |isbn= 9780691007045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Munteanu A, Solé RV  |title= Phenotypic diversity and chaos in a minimal cell model |url= |journal= J Theor Biol |volume= 240|issue= 3 | pages= 434–442 |year= 2006 |pmid= 16330052|doi= 10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Pratt AJ |title= Prebiological evolution and the metabolic origins of life |url= |journal= Prebiological evolution and the metabolic origins of life |volume= 17|issue= 3 | pages= 203–217 |year= 2011 |pmid= 21554111|doi= 10.1162/artl_a_00032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artificial life===

Chemoton has laid down the foundation of some aspects of [[artificial life]]. The computational basis has become a topic of software development and experimentation in the investigation of artificial life.&lt;ref name=hug/&gt; The main reason is that chemoton simplifies the otherwise complex biochemical and molecular functions of living cells. Since the chemoton is a system consisting of a large but fixed number of interacting molecular species, it can effectively be implemented in a process algebra-based [[Computer language|language]] such as the BlenX programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Zachar I, Fedor A, Szathmáry E |title= Two different template replicators coexisting in the same protocell: stochastic simulation of an extended chemoton model |url= |journal= PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue= 7 | pages= 1380 |year= 2011 |pmid=21818258 |pmc=3139576|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0021380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Dematté L, Larcher R, Palmisano A, Priami C, Romanel A |title= Programming Biology in BlenX |url= |journal= Systems Biology for Signaling Networks |volume=1 | pages= 777–820 |year= 2010 | doi= 10.1007/978-1-4419-5797-9_31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colloquial Welsh prepositions''' deals with the [[preposition]]s (Welsh: {{lang|cy|arddodiad}}) of the [[Colloquial Welsh morphology|colloquial Welsh language]], the spoken [[language register|register]] of the modern [[Welsh language]] as spoken in [[Wales]] by [[first-language]] speakers. This page does not deal with the literary standard forms of the prepositions nor any dialect which may have arisen outside of Wales. &lt;!-- SO PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO "CORRECT" THE FORMS GIVEN AS PER THE LITERARY STANDARD. --&gt; Welsh has two standardised forms: ''Literary Welsh'' – a conservative language reserved for literary purposes which retains some features of older Welsh; and ''Colloquial Welsh'' – the Welsh one will hear being spoken in Welsh speaking areas. For the most part the two languages share prepositions, though for some of them their usages can differ; there are also some which have lost their inflected forms in the colloquial language but is preserved in the literary standard. Colloquial Welsh also shows some variation in initial-consonant mutations, which is explained below, while the literary form retains the "proper" mutations in all cases. Welsh prepositions do (for the most part) perform the same rolls as English prepositions but there is variation and these must be learnt as they are encountered. For instance it is often taught that Welsh ''am'' "means 'for'" and ''i'' "means 'to'"; this is not incorrect but ''am'' can also mean 'about' or 'at' and ''i'' can mean 'for'. The usages given below outline how each preposition is used in modern colloquial Welsh.

==Definitions of Welsh prepositions==
Prepositions are words like [[List of English prepositions|''on, at, to, from, by'' and ''for'' in English]].&lt;ref name="KingPreps"&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Gareth |year=2016 |orig-year=1993 |chapter=443-476 Prepositions |title=Modern Welsh – A Comprehensive Grammar |language=English |edition=Third |location=London and New York |publisher=Routledge |pages=335-373 |isbn=978-1-138-82630-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often describe a relationship, spatial or temporal, between persons and objects.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; For example, 'the book is ''on'' the table'; 'the table is ''by'' the window'.

Welsh prepositions come in two categories: ''simple prepositions ({{lang|cy|arddodiad godidog}})'' and ''compound prepositions ({{lang|cy|arddodiad cyfansawdd}})''&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;; the former are single words, like English ''on, at, from, to'' etc. while the latter consist of a simple preposition + some other element (often a noun) like English ''in front of'' or ''in addition to''. Compound prepositions are less frequent than simple prepositions and are discussed below.

==Simple prepositions==

There are approximately two-dozen or so simple prepositions in modern colloquial Welsh. While some have clear-cut and obvious translations (''heb'' ‘without’), others correspond to different English prepositions depending on context (''i, wrth, am''). As with all areas of modern Welsh, some words are preferred in the North and others in the South.

The main prepositions used in modern colloquial Welsh are (alternative forms in parentheses):&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
* â / ag
* am
* ar
* at
* cyn
* dan (o dan)
* dros (tros)
* efo (hefo)
* gan
* ger
* gyda / gydag
* heb
* hyd
{{col-2}}
* i
* mewn
* o
* oddiar (oddi ar)
* oddiwrth (oddi wrth)
* rhag
* rhwng
* tan
* trwy (drwy)
* tua / tuag
* wrth
* yn
{{col-end}}
Most of these (but not all) share the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# they cause mutation of the following word
# they inflect for person and number, similar to verbs
# they can be used with a following verbal-noun

==Mutations after prepositions==

The majority of Welsh prepositions cause mutation to the following word – the most common, by far, is the soft mutation. Examples:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
* ''am ddim'' – ‘for nothing, free’ (&lt; ''dim'')
* ''dan ofal'' – ‘under care’ (&lt; ''gofal'')
* ''i Dreffynnon'' – ‘to [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]]’ (&lt; ''Treffynnon'')
{{col-2}}
* ''ar fwrdd'' – ‘on a table’ (&lt; ''bwrdd'')
* ''heb fynd'' – ‘without going’ ( &lt; ''mynd'')
* ''o gig'' – ‘of meat’ (&lt; ''cig'')
{{col-end}}

Several do not cause any mutation (most notably ''rhag, rhwng'' and ''mewn''&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;), while ''â, gyda'' and ''tua'' should cause aspirate mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; but in reality they are usually left unmutated&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; (except for set expressions&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;), since the aspirate mutation is dying out and for many speakers only mutation of ''c-'' /k/ is normal while mutation of ''p-'' /p/ and ''t-'' /t/ is not.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''Yn'' ‘in’ alone causes the nasal mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; which also is not as widespread as suggested by the literary standard&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and is often replaced by the soft mutation. It should also be noted that personal names are not mutated after prepositions but names of places and other nouns are: ''i ferch'' ‘to a girl’, ''o Fangor'' ‘from Bangor’, but ''i Dafydd'' ‘to Dafydd’, not ''*i Ddafydd''&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; (although mutation of personal names can be found in older texts).

==Inflected prepositions==

When used with a personal pronoun, most prepositions insert a linking syllable before the pronoun. This syllable changes for each preposition and results in an inflection pattern similar to that found in Welsh verbs. Broadly speaking, the endings for inflected prepositions ({{lang|cy|arddodiad rhagenwol}}) are as follows:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

:{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background: #efefef;"
| colspan="2" |
! scope="col" | Singular
! scope="col" | Plural
|-
! colspan="2" scope="row" | First Person
| {{lang|cy|-a i}}
| {{lang|cy|-on ni}}
|-
! colspan="2" scope="row" | Second Person
| {{lang|cy|-at ti}}
| {{lang|cy|-och chi}}
|-
! rowspan="2" scope="row" | Third Person
! scope="row" | Masculine
| {{lang|cy|-o fe/fo}}
| rowspan="2" | {{lang|cy|-yn nhw}}
|-
! scope="row" | Feminine
| {{lang|cy|-i hi}}
|}

There is some dialect variation between these endings, particularly with 1st and 2nd pers. sing., which can often end in ''-o i''&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and ''-ot ti''&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and 2nd pers. pl. ''-och chi'' is often heard as ''-ach chi''.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; 3rd pers. sing. and 3rd pers. pl. endings are always as shown but almost always omit the pronoun element, leaving the inflectional ending by itself to indicate person:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

* ''Gad lonydd iddo!'' – ‘Leave him alone!’ (instead of ''Gad lonydd iddo fe'')
* ''Na i hala llythyr ati bore fory'' – ‘I’ll send her a letter tomorrow morning’ (instead of ''… ati hi…'')
* ''Paid deud wrtho am y tro'' – ‘Don’t tell him for the time being’ (instead of ''…wrtho fo…'')

But note that the 3rd pers. pl. ''-yn nhw'' is never shortened in this manner.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

These differ from the literary standard where the 1st pers. sing. is ''-af i''; the 1st pers. pl. is ''-om ni''; the 3rd pers. sing. masc. is ''-o ef'' and the 3rd. pers. pl. is ''-ynt hwy''.&lt;ref name="ThomasPreps" /&gt; The literary standard also has the alternative 2nd pers. pl. pronoun ''chwi''.&lt;ref name="ThomasPreps" /&gt; Most of these are never encountered in the colloquial language and therefore will not be presented in the inflected forms in this article.

The linking element between the preposition and the ending is more complicated, however. Different prepositions use a different linking element. For example, ''am'' inserts ''-dan-'' before its endings (''amdana i, amdanat ti, amdani hi'' etc.),&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; while ''heb'' uses ''-dd-'' (''hebdda i, hebddo fo, hebddyn nhw'' etc.)&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''Rhwng'' changes its vowel (from ''w'' to ''y'') as well as inserting ''-dd-'' (''rhyngddyn nhw'')&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; while some, like ''at'' and ''wrth'' add the endings with no linking element (''ato fe, atoch chi, wrthyn nhw, wrthon ni'' etc.)&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and some, like ''gyda'' and ''efo'' do not inflect at all.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

==Prepositions and their uses==

===Â / ag===

''Â'' (''ag'' before vowels&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;) causes aspirate mutation.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; It means ‘with’, but note that there are other equivalents to ‘with’ in Welsh (''efo, gan'' and ''gyda'') Use of ''â/ag'' is fairly restricted:

# It indicates the means by which something is done or achieved, or the instrument of an action:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Nes i agor ‘y mys i â chyllell fara'' – ‘I cut [literally ‘opened’] my finger with a breadknife’&lt;br /&gt;This usage often uses ‘by’ in English as an alternative to ‘with’:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
##&lt;li value=2&gt;''Gawn ni dalu â siec fan hyn?'' – ‘Can we pay by cheque here?’
#&lt;li value=2&gt; Where the relationship between two objects is regarded as a close and permanent association, ''â/ag'' is more common than ''gyda'' or ''efo''.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# It means ‘as’ with equative forms of adjectives:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Mor ddu â’r fran'' – ‘As black as a crow’’
# Used idiomatically with the verbs ''mynd'' and ''dod'' to create ''mynd â'' ‘take’ and ''dod â'' ‘bring’ [literally ‘go with’ and ‘come with’].&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; The Welsh word ''cymryd'' 'take' strictly means 'take hold of, seize, grab' and cannot be used in place of ''mynd â''.
# ''Â/ag'' is used with many common verbs like ''siarad'' 'speak', ''cwrdd'' 'meet' and ''ymweld'' 'visit'&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; to make ''siarad â, cwrdd â'' and ''ymweld â'' in which case Welsh aligns more with [[American English]] than with [[British English]]:
## ''Dim ond ddoe o'n i'n siarad ag e'' – 'It was only yesterday I was speaking to him' [...speaking with him]
## ''Lle gwrddest ti â fe gynta?'' – 'Where did you first meet him?' [...meet with him?]
## ''Pa mor aml dach chi'n ymweld â'ch nain yn y Gogledd?'' – 'How often do you visit your grandmother up North?' [...visit with your grandmother...]
# The verb ''peidio'' 'stop, cease' is used to form negative commands and is followed by ''â/ag'' in the standard language&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ThomasPreps" /&gt; but its use is entirely optional in speech.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; with the exception of certain set phrases, e.g. ''paid â malu'' 'stop talking nonsense'. In the colloquial language both ''paid â phoeni'' [or ''paid â poeni'' without mutation] and ''paid poeni'' are commonly heard.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

===Am===

''Am'' is a very common preposition in spoken Welsh&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; with a range of English equivalents&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;:
#'Exchange for' – this meaning is used with verbs like ''talu'' 'pay' to give '' talu am'' 'pay for' [give money in exchange for]:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Dales i bedair punt am y rhain'' – 'I paid four pounds [£4] for these'
# In time expressions Welsh ''am'' is equivalent to English 'at':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
##''Ddo i'n ôl am saith'' – 'I'll come back at seven'&lt;br /&gt;
# ''Am'' means 'for' in expressions of duration of time:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Fuon nhw yng Ngogledd yr Eidal am fis'' – 'They were in Northern Italy for a month'
# ''Am'' means 'about/concerning' when used with the verbs ''siarad'' 'speak/talk', ''sôn'' 'speak/talk' and ''meddwl'' 'think':
## ''Am beth dych chi'n siarad?'' – 'What are you talking about?'
## ''Gawn ni weld be' mae'n feddwl am hynny'' – 'We will see what s/he thinks about that'
# Spatially, ''am'' means 'about/around' with a sense of something actually being surrounded or enclosed:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Rhowch rwymyn am ei ben o'' – 'Put a bandage around his head'&lt;br /&gt; Phrases like 'around the town' require a compound preposition like ''o amgylch'' or ''o gwmpas''.
# When ''am'' precedes a verbal-noun it means '... want to...':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Wyt ti am ddod 'da ni neu beidio, 'te?'' – 'Do you want to come with us or not, then?'
## ''Dw i am siarad ag e cyn iddo fynd'' – 'I want to talk to him before he goes'

Using ''am'' to mean 'about' with verbs have been discussed above. With most other verbs ''am'' usually means 'for':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
* ''Dw i wedi bod yn chwilio amdanat ti ers awr'' – 'I have been looking for you for an hour'

''Am'' also has other meanings in the [[Literary Welsh morphology|literary language]] which are not a feature of the spoken form, such as 'towards'.&lt;ref name="ThomasPreps"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Stephen J. |year=1980 |orig-year=1980 |chapter=Prepositions |title=A Welsh Grammar |language=English |edition=First |location=Cardiff |publisher=[[University of Wales|University of Wales Press]] |pages=127-143 |isbn=0-7083-0737-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ar===

''Ar'' has a number of English equivalents, but usually equates to 'on'.

# ''Ar'' means 'on' in a purely spatial sense with location and motion:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Mae'r llyfr ar y bwrdd'' – 'The book is on the table'
## ''Rho'r llyfr ar y bwrdd'' – 'Put the book on the table'
# It means 'about to' when followed by a verbal-noun:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Brysiwch, mae'r trên ar fynd!'' – 'Hurry up, the train's about to go!'
## ''Mae teledu lloeren ar ddod'' – 'Satellite TV is almost here' [literally 'about to come']
## ''Pan o'n i ar wneud hynny'' – 'When I was about to do that'
# ''Ar'' is used with expressions of temporary physical and mental states,&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; like illnesses. It often (but not always) corresponds to English 'have':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Mae'r ddannodd arna i'' – 'I've got toothache [literally 'toothache is on me']
## ''Roedd y ffliw arni'' – 'She had flu' [lit. 'the flu was on her']
## ''Oes ofn arnat ti?'' – 'Are you afraid?' [lit. 'is fear on you?]
# ''Ar'' can mean 'of' when talking about a part or sample:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Dim ond rhyw flas ges i arno fo'' – 'I only got a taste of it'
# ''Ar'' is often used with expressions of time and the weather where its English equivalent can change:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''ar Ddydd Llun'' – 'on a Monday, on Mondays'
## ''ar yr un adeg'' – 'at the same time'
## ''ar dywydd poeth'' – 'in hot weather'
# ''Ar'' is used with the verbs ''gwrando'' 'listen' and ''edrych'' 'look' to make ''gwrando ar'' 'listen to' and ''edrych ar'' 'watch'.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; A common mistake made by learners is to use the preposition ''i'' &lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;:
## ''Ar beth dych chi'n gwrando?'' – 'What are you listening to?'
## ''Ar beth wyt ti'n edrych?'' – 'What are you watching?'
## ''Dw i'n edrych ar y teledu'' – 'I'm watching TV'

===At===

While Welsh ''at'' often corresponds to English 'at', the field of scope of Welsh ''at'' is far wider.

# ''At'' is used for English 'to' when it implies motion ''up to'' (but not ''into'') a destination (''into'' is covered by ''i'' and the two are often confused by English speakers&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;). In Welsh we must say, for example, ''danfon llythyr at Sioned'' 'send a letter to Sioned' but ''danfon llythyr i Lundain'' 'send a letter to London' – Sioned is a person and takes ''at'', London is a place and takes ''i''. More examples:
## ''Rhaid ini fynd â ti at y deintydd bore fory'' – 'We must take you to the dentist tomorrow morning'
## ''Lluchiwch y bêl ata i!'' – 'Chuck the ball to me!'
#It can mean 'for' with the sense of 'benefit/good/purpose of':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''At beth mae hwnna i fod?'' – 'What's that supposed to be for?
## ''Mae'r arian i gyd yn mynd at achosion da'' – 'All the money is going to(wards) good causes'
# ''Tuag at'' is the usual expression corresponding to the literary term ''tua'' 'towards'.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; In the colloquial language ''tua'' now means 'about' in expressions of time.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Rhedwch chi i gyd tuag ata i!'' – 'All of you run towards me!'
# ''Hyd at'' is a variant of ''hyd'' 'up to':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; 
## ''Dyma hi wedyn yn cochi hyd at ei chlustiau'' – 'Then she blushed right up to her ears

Some verbs which use ''at'' include:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

* ''anelu at'' – 'aim for/at'
* ''anfon/danfon at'' – 'send to (a person)'
* ''cofio at'' – 'remember (a person to another person)'
* ''cyfeirio at'' – 'refer to'
* ''cyfrannu at'' – 'contribute to'
* ''dychryn at'' – 'be frightened at'
* ''edrych ymlaen at'' - 'look forward to'
* ''hala at'' – 'send to (a person)'
* ''paratoi at'' – 'prepare for'
* ''(y)sgrifennu/sgwennu at'' – 'write to (a person)'
* ''synnu at'' – 'be surprised at, marvel at'
* ''ychwanegu at'' – 'add to'

| {{lang|cy|ati hi}}
|}

===Cyn===

''Cyn'' means 'before' in expressions of time,&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; never in spatial expressions, e.g. ''cyn y Rhyfel'' 'before the War' or ''cyn deg o'r gloch'' 'before 10 o'clock'. It is also used as a conjunction.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''Cyn'' does not cause a mutation, nor does it have inflected forms. Examples of ''cyn'':

* ''Mi ddaw hi'n ôl cyn hynny'' – 'She'll come back before that'
* ''Gadewch ini orffen hwn cyn y bore'' – 'Let's get this finished before the morning'

It is important for anyone learning Welsh to understand that the compound preposition ''o flaen'' 'in front of' cannot be used instead of ''cyn''. The two are not interchangeable despite their interchangeability in English in sentences like 'to stand before/in front of the building':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

* ''Na i gwrdd â chi cyn y cyngerdd'' – 'I'll meet you before the concert' [temporal]
* ''Na i gwrdd â chi o flaen Canolfan y Celfyddydau'' – 'I'll meet you in front of the Arts Centre' [spatial]

As an adjectival prefix, ''cyn-'' always means 'ex-' or 'former'.

===Dan===

''Dan'' (sometimes heard as ''o dan'') causes soft mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and means 'under':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''dan y dŵr'' 'under the water', ''dan ddylanwad ei reini'' 'under the influence of his parents'. It should be noted that the related compound preposition ''oddidan'' (also ''odditan'') means 'from under'.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

The term ''dan ofal'' 'under care', abbreviated to ''d/o'' is the norm for 'care of' when addressing letters.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

The two most important idioms using ''dan'' are:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# ''Dan ei sang'' – 'full to bursting, packed' (used of rooms, buildings, etc.)
# ''Dan haul'' – 'under (the) sun'

The unmutated form, ''tan'' is now, to all intents and purposes, obsolete in this meaning and has become a separate preposition in its own right and means 'until'.

===Dros===

''Dros'' has two variants:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''tros'' (regarded as particularly literary nowadays&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;) and ''drost'' (still very common in speech all over Wales). ''Dros'' causes soft mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and means:

# 'Over' in a purely spatial sense.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; For example, ''dros y bont'' 'over the bridge', ''edrych dros y clawdd'' 'look over the hedge'. It can also mean 'all over' when speaking about a large area:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''Mae caneuon Meinir Gwilym yn boblogaidd dros Gymru gyfan'' 'Meinir Gwilym's songs are popular all over Wales'.
#'Over' in the sense of 'more than' (as in English):&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''Mae dros fil o bobol yn y neuadd yn barod'' 'There are over a thousand people in the hall already'.
# 'For' in the sense of 'on behalf of':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Nei di fynd lawr i'r siop drosta i?'' – 'Will you go to the shop for me?'
## ''Dan ni i gyd yn teimlo drostat ti'' – 'We all feel for you''
# When used with nouns like ''rheswm'' 'reason' and ''esgus'' 'excuse' (and usually with a verbal-noun) equates to English 'for':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Alla i'm gweld unrhyw reswm dros ymddwyn fel 'ny'' – 'I can see no reason for behaving like this'
## ''Barn Huw ydy fod 'na ddim esgus dros ragrith'' – 'Huw is of the opinion that there is no excuse for hypocrisy'

Idioms using ''dros'' tend to be adverbial. Two very common and useful set phrases using ''dros'' are:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# ''Dros ben llestri'' – 'Over the top'
## '''Sdim eisiau mynd dros ben llestri, nag oes?'' – 'There's no need to go over the top, is there?'
# ''Dros ben'' – 'Exceedingly'
## ''Mae'r sefyllfa yn un ddifrifiol dros ben'' – 'The situation is (an) exceedingly serious (one)'

===Efo===

''Efo'' (also ''hefo''&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; in some areas of North Wales) does not cause mutation and is a general word meaning 'with' and is restricted to Northern dialects of the spoken language.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; In the South ''gyda'' is always used instead.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; The only appearance of ''gyda'' in the North is in set phrases like ''gyda'r nos'' 'in the evening'. ''Efo'' and ''gyda'' are not, however, always interchangeable as ''gyda'' (or its contracted form '''da'') is used in the South to express possession;&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; in the North this is not achieved by ''efo'' but by ''gan''.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; The following examples are all Northern dialect where ''(h)efo'' can be substituted for ''gyda'' in the South:
# ''Dan ni'n mynd i'r Swisdir efo'r Jonesiaid eleni'' – 'We are going to Switzerland with the Jonses this year'
# ''Hefo pwy dach chi'n rhannu tro 'ma, 'ta?'' – 'Who are you sharing with this time, then?'
# ''Mi ddo i hefo chdi rŵan'' – 'I'll come with you now'

''Efo'' does not have inflected forms.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

===Gan===

''Gan'' (often heard as ''gyn''&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;) causes soft mutation.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; It is another Northern dialect word used to express possession and is replaced by ''gyda'' in the South.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''Mae gan Mrs Williams gath fawr'' 'Mrs Williams has a large cat'. Although ''gan'' and ''gyda'' are interchangeable in this context, the structure of the sentences differs and it is not as simple as substituting one word for the other.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; The following example sentence is translated using ''gan'' (Northern) and ''gyda'' (Southern) and means 'do you have enough money?':
# ''Oes gen ti ddigon o arian?'' (Northern)
# ''Oes digon o arian gyda ti?'' (Southern)

There are, however, other uses for ''gan'' not involving possession and are therefore common in both the North and the South:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

# 'by' in passive sentences&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Fe geith copïau o'r llyfr eu harwyddo gan yr awdur bore fory'' – 'Copies of the book will be signed by the author tomorrow morning'
## ''Ges i mrathu gan gi ar y ffordd adre'' – 'I got bitten by a dog on the way home'
# By extension of 1 (above) it is also used to mean 'by' as in the author of a work:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''The Lord of the Rings gan J. R. R. Tolkien''
# Equates to English 'from' or 'off' where something is handed over or transmitted from one thing to another:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; (Compare with ''oddiwrth'')
## ''Ges i bunt gynno fo'' – ''I got a pound off him'
## ''Pa newyddion gaethon nhw gynni hi?'' – 'What news did they get from her?'
## ''Gyn bwy gest ti fenthyg ono fo?'' – 'Who did you borrow it from?'
# When used with verbal-nouns ''gan'' can imply a simultaneous action:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Aethon nhw lawr y stryd gan guro ar y drysiau i gyd'' – 'They went down the street banging on all the doors'
## ''Gan feddwl, dw i ddim yn siwr fyddai hynny'n syniad da'' – 'Thinking about it, I'm not sure (if) that would be a good idea'&lt;br /&gt;In this sense the pronunciation is usually ''gan'' and not ''gyn''.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

Some common idioms using ''gan'':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# ''Mae'n ddrwg gen i'' – 'I'm sorry'
# ''(Mae'n) well gen i'' – 'I prefer' (c.f. ''well imi...'' 'I had better...')
# ''Mae'n dda gen i gwrdd â chi'' – 'I'm pleased to meet you'

===Ger===

''Ger'' does not cause a mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and is used with geographical locations (usually town and city names) to mean 'in the vicinity of':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# ''Ger Barcelona mae Mark a'i deulu'n byw bellach'' – 'Mark and his family live near Barcelona now'
# ''Dan ni'n byw mewn pentre bach ger Harlech'' – 'We live in a small village near Harlech'

It should be noted that ''ger'' is related to the term ''gerbron'' which means 'before' in the sense of 'in the presence of' or 'for the attention of' and is used with nouns like ''llys'' 'court' or ''bwrdd'' 'board':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# ''Daethpwyd â chwe achos gerbron y llys bore 'ma'' – 'Six cases were brought before the court this morning' [formal]
# ''Bydd y bwrdd yn rhoi ystyriaeth fanwl i'r holl dystiolaeth a roddwyd gerbron yr wythnos hon'' – 'The board will carefully consider all the evidence that has been presented this week' [formal]

''Ger'' has no inflected forms.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

===Gyda / gydag===

''Gyda'' (''gydag'' before vowels&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;) causes aspirate mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and is the general term for 'with' in the South (c.f. ''efo'' in the North). With the exception of idioms, it is usually heard as '''da'' in speech:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''Oes amser 'da chi i brynu'r tocynnau?'' 'Have you got time to buy the tickets?'

''Gyda/gydag'' is used in the South to show possession, as ''gan'' is used in the North,&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; but their forms differ, compare the following sentence 'do you have enough food?':
# ''Oes digon o fwyd 'da ti?'' (South)
# ''Oes gen ti ddigon o fwyd?'' (North)

''Gyda/gydag'' does not have inflected forms&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;, so ''gyda fi, gyda ti, gyda nhw'' but note that 'with him' can be either ''(gy)da fe'' or ''(gy)dag e''.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

===Heb===

''Heb'' causes soft mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and in its primary meaning, ''heb'' means 'without':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''heb arian'' 'without money', ''peidiwch mynd hebdda i!'' 'don't go without me!'. 

''Heb'' can be used with a verbal-noun to make a negative construction in the perfect tense – equivalent to ''ddim wedi'':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''Dan ni heb benderfynu'' 'We haven't decided' (=''Dan ni ddim wedi penderfynu''); ''Mae o heb fynd eto'' 'He hasn't gone yet' (=''Dydy o ddim wedi mynd eto'').

''Heb'' + possessive adjective + verbal-noun corresponds to 'which/who has/have not been' or an adjectival 'un....ed':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''pobol heb eu cofrestru'' 'people who have not been registered' [lit. 'people without their registering']; ''pryd o fwyd heb ei fwyta'' 'an uneaten meal' [lit. 'a meal of food without its eating'].

Some idioms using ''heb'':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# ''Heb ei ail'' (feminine: ''heb ei hail'') – 'second-to-none, first-rate'
## ''Dyma bortread heb ei ail o fywyd y glowyr yn y tridegau'' – This is a first-rate portrayal of miners' lives in the thirties'
# ''Yn amlach na heb'' or ''yn fyw na heb'' – 'more often than not'
## ''Yn amlach na heb, mae'r fath ymddygiad yn arwain at drychineb'' – 'More often than not, this kind of behaviour leads to disaster'

===Hyd===

''Hyd'' causes soft mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and has the following meanings:

# 'up to, until' in a temporal sense.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; In this sense it is often interchangeable with ''tan''.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Mae'r cyrsiau'n para hyd ddiwedd mis Mehefin'' – 'The courses go on until the end of June'
# 'up to' in a spatial sense&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and is often expanded to ''hyd at'':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Oedd e hyd at ei wddw yn y dŵr'' – 'He was up to his neck in the water'
## ''Wedson nhw 'tha i am dalu hyd at ugain punt a dim mwy'' – 'I was told to pay up to twenty pounds (£20) and no more'

Pronouns are not normally used with this preposition.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

The following are all commonly used idioms using ''hyd'',&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; though it is not strictly a preposition in all cases:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# ''Cael hyd i'' – 'find'
## ''Gest ti hyd iddo?'' – 'Did you find it?'
# ''Dod o hyd i'' – 'find'
## ''Daethpwyd o hyd i gorff'' – 'A body has been found' [formal]
# ''Hyd yn oed'' – 'even'
## ''Mae hyd yn oed Gareth wedi dod'' – 'Even Gareth has come'
# ''Hyd yn hyn'' (or ''hyd yma'') – 'so far, up till now'
## '''Sdim sôn am fynd at y llysoedd hyd yn hyn'' – 'There's no talk of going to the courts so far'
# ''O hyd'' – 'still; all the time'
## ''Dyn ni yma o hyd'' – 'We're still here'
## ''Mae o'n siarad o hyd am ei ffôn symudol'' – 'He's always going on about his mobile phone'
# ''Hyd y gwela i'' – 'as far as I can see'
## ''Fydd 'na ddim problemau hyd y gwela i'' – 'There'll be no problems as far as I can see'
# ''hyd y gwn i'' – 'as far as I know'
## ''Mae popeth wedi'i drefnu, hyd y gwn i'' – 'Everything's set, as far as I know'
# ''Hyd'' also appears as a conjunction meaning 'until' with a following verb&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Ewch ymlaen ffordd 'ma hyd gwelwch chi faes chwarae ar y dde'' – 'Go on this way until you see you see a playing field on the right'
# The compound preposition ''ar hyd'' 'along, the length of...' and with units of time 'all....... long'&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Ewch ar hyd y ffordd 'ma am ddeng munud, yna trowch i'r dde'' – 'Go along this road for ten minutes, then turn left'
## ''Ar hyd y nos'' – 'All night long'

''Hyd'' does not have inflected forms.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

===I===

''I'' causes soft mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and often, but by no means always, corresponds to English 'to'.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; It is possibly the most frequently used preposition in the spoken Welsh language.

''I'' corresponds to English 'to' in the following senses:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# Motion towards or into a place
## ''Dych chi'n mynd i'r dre heddiw?'' – 'Are you going to town today?'
# Used with the indirect object (giving something to somebody). Note that English can (and often does) omit this preposition but Welsh always requires ''i''.
## ''Roddes i'r llyfr i Fred'' – 'I gave the book to Fred'
## ''Elli di ddangos hwnna i mi am eilliad?'' – 'Can you show me that a moment?'
# Equates to English 'to' with the sense of 'purpose' or 'in order to' when followed by a verbal-noun:
## ''Fe adawodd y ddwy onyn nhw'n gynnar i ddal y bws'' – 'They both left early to catch the bus'
## ''Ddaethon ni â'r pris lawr i ddenu mwy o bobol'' – 'We brought the price down to attract more people'&lt;br /&gt;In this sense the compound preposition ''er mwyn'' 'in order to' is often used as an alternative:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''... er mwyn dal y bws...'' and ''...er mwyn denu mwy o bobol'' etc.

Other common uses for ''i'' which do not correspond to 'to':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

# English 'for'
## ''Mae gen i lythyron i chi'' – 'I've got some letters for you'
## ''Nes i'r holl waith paratoi i ti bore 'ma'' – 'I did all the preparation for you this morning'
## ''Arhoswch funud - na i llnau nhw i chi'' – 'Wait a minute - I'll clean them for you' &lt;small&gt;[''llnau'' is a colloquial contracted form of ''glanhau'' 'to clean']&lt;/small&gt;
# ''I'' can denote possession – especially when ''gyda/gan'' is not possible due to the nature of the sentence:
## ''Mae'r bobol 'na'n ffrindiau i mi'' – 'Those people are friends of mine' [lit. 'friends to me']
# Used after verbs of making or causing:
## ''Paid gwneud i Eleri chwerthin wrth iddi fwyta'' – 'Don't make Eleri laugh while she is eating'
## ''Yr unig esboniad a roddwyd oedd mai taro rhewfryn a achosodd iddi suddo'' – 'The only explanation given was that it was hitting an iceberg that caused her to sink'
# Used after conjunctions (usually of time) to introduce the subject:
## ''...cyn i mi fynd'' – '...before I go'
## ''...er mwyn iddo ddeall'' – 'so that he can/could understand'
# Means 'that' in past tense sentences + subject + verbal-noun:
## ''Dw i'n eitha siwr iddi ffonio rywbryd ddoe'' – 'I'm pretty sure (that) she phoned some time yesterday'

When 'i' follows a verb its meaning usually parallels English but it should be noted that the English preposition can often be omitted.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; It should also be noted that ''gofyn'' 'ask' must also take ''i'' which may be unexpected by English speakers.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# ''Gofynnwch iddo fo ydy o'n dod'' – 'Ask him if he is coming' [lit. 'ask to him...']
# ''Efallai y byddwch chi eisiau gofyn i'r plant am eu syniadau nhw'' – 'Perhaps you will want to ask the children for their ideas'

The idiom ''rhoi gwybod i'' means 'inform' or 'let..... know':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# ''Rhowch wybod i mi os glywch chi rywbeth'' – 'Let me know if you hear anything'

The idiom ''yn dal i'' is used to mean 'still ....ing':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# ''Mae Seren yn dal i deimlo'n sâl'' – 'Seren is still feeling ill'
# ''Mae'n dal i fwrw'' – 'It's still raining'

Even though ''i'' can cover 'into' (''i'r tŷ'' '(in)to the house'; ''i Gymru'' '(in)to Wales' etc.) the expanded form ''i mewn i'' (and rarely ''i fewn i'') can be used where this is the central idea or where it is emphasised:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# ''Drychon ni o amgylch yr ardd, wedyn mynd i mewn i'r tŷ ei hun'' – 'We had a look around the garden, then we went into the house itself'

Notes:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# ''i mi'' and ''i fi'' are interchangeable but ''i fi'' is much more common in the South.
# An older form of the 2nd pers. pl. ''iwch'' is still heard in the expression ''Nos dawch!, 'sdawch!'' 'Good night!' (contraction of ''nos da iwch'' 'good night to you') and is heard in the North.

===Mewn===

''Mewn'' does not cause mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and should not be confused with ''i mewn''. It means 'in' but is only used where the following noun is non-specific. Specific nouns require the use of ''yn''.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; Compare:
# ''mewn tŷ'' – 'in a house'; but ''yn y tŷ'' – 'in the house'
# ''mewn ardaloedd gwledig'' – 'in rural areas'; but ''yn yr ardaloedd gwledig'' – 'in the  rural areas'
# ''mewn gwladwriaeth ddemocrataidd'' – 'in a democratic state'; but ''yn Israel'' – 'in Israel'
# ''mewn gwlad estron'' – 'in a foreign country'; but ''yn Lloegr'' – 'in England'

''Mewn'' does not have inflected forms.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

===O===

''O'' causes soft mutation.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; It equates to English 'from' and 'of',&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; but care must be taken – ''o'' cannot be used for genitive constructions (those showing possession) for which Welsh has a specific method of constructing. ''O'' has the following meanings:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

# 'From' in most English senses, whether motion is implied or not.
## ''Dw i'n dod o Fangor yn wreiddiol'' – 'I come from Bangor originally'
## ''O Lanfairpwll ar Ynys Môn mae'r gantores Elin Fflur yn dod'' – 'The singer Elin Fflur comes from Llanfairpwll on Anglesey'
## ''Mae mrawd i'n llogi tŷ yn Nyfnaint o fis Mehefin tan fis Medi'' – 'My brother's renting a house in Devon from June to September'
# 'Of' in quantity expressions or where part of something is implied
## ''Wi'n moyn hanner pwys o gaws a dwy botel o laeth'' – 'I want half a pound of cheese and two bottles of milk'
# ''O'' can also be used with verbal-nouns:
## ''O ystyreid mai dyma'r tro cynta iddo siarad yn gyhoeddus, mae'n edrych yn hyderus iawn'' – 'Considering (or: When you consider...) that this is the first time he's spoken in public, he looks very confident' [lit. 'From considering...']
## ''O'n i'n mynd i fod yn grac, ond o siarad â nhw mae'n amlwg fod 'na ryw gamddealltwriaeth wedi bod yn rhywle'' – 'I was going to be cross, but (after) speaking to them it's clear that there's been some misunderstanding somewhere' [lit. '..., but from speaking...']
# ''O'' can convey adverbial '-ly' where it qualifies and adjective – ''arbennig o dda'' 'especially good', ''hynod o galed'' 'extraordinarily hard'

Notes:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# Variants ''ono i'' and ''onot ti'' are common.
# Extended variants adding ''-ho-'' are also used (these are, strictly speaking, more "correct" forms, but they are usually not encountered in rapid speech), so ''ohonoch chi'' = ''onoch chi'' etc. These extended forms also more like the literary standard forms with the exceptions of 1st pers. sing. and 3rd pers. pl.
# A negative variant ''mo'' is also in use and is a contraction of ''dim o''. This can be heard as ''monoch chi'' = ''dim ohonoch chi''.

===Oddiar===

''Oddiar'' (also seen as ''oddi ar''&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;) causes soft mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and is a compound of ''o'' + ''ar'' (with ''o'' in its 3rd pers. sing. fem. form). ''Oddiar'' also takes the same inflections as ''ar'',&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; e.g. ''oddiarno fo''. It is basically the opposite of ''ar'' and describes motion in the opposite direction of ''ar''.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; It therefore means 'off' in the sense of 'from upon':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''Cymer dy bethau oddiar y bwrdd, nei di?'' 'Take your things off the table, will you?'. ''Oddiar'' is not used to translate adverbial use of English 'off' ('turn off the TV', 'buzz off'), for which Welsh uses ''i ffwrdd'' (North) and ''bant'' (South).

===Oddiwrth===

''Oddiwrth'' (also ''oddi wrth''&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;) causes soft mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and is a compound of ''o'' + ''wrth'' (with ''o'' in its 3rd pers. sing. fem. form). ''Oddiwrth'' inflects in the same way as ''wrth''&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;, so ''oddiwrthi hi'' etc. It means 'from' but is restricted to sentiments sent from one person to another – the opposite of ''at'': ''Gaethon ni ddim cerdyn oddiwrth dy reini eleni, naddo?'' 'We didn't get a card from your parents this year, did we?; or ''Penblwydd Hapus oddiwrth bawb yn y swyddfa'' 'Happy Birthday from everyone at the office'.

Where a verb of receiving (like ''cael'') is used – as in the first example above, ''gan'' is a possible alternative to ''oddiwrth''.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

===Rhag===

''Rhag'' is a lesser used preposition in colloquial Welsh&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and its usage is very restricted.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''Rhag'' causes no mutations&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and has the following meanings:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

# 'from' but only after certain verbs, like ''atal'' 'stop', ''rhwystro'' 'prevent', ''gwahardd'' 'forbid, prohibit':
## ''Bydd rhaid ceisio atal y bobol 'ma rhag dod yn rhy agos'' – 'We'll have to try to stop these people from coming too close''
## ''Dw i am rwystro chi rhag niweidio'ch hunan'' – 'I want to try to prevent you (from) hurting yourself'
## ''Fe waharddwyd y teithwyr rhag mynd ymhellach'' – 'The travellers were forbidden to go any further'
# ''Rhag'' is used as part of the conjunction ''rhag ofn'' 'in case, for fear that...':
## ''Dere di ag un yfory hefyd, rhag ofn i mi anghofio'' – 'You bring one tomorrow too, in case I forget'
# It can appear in set expressions such as ''rhag cywilydd!'' 'for shame!', which is a less common version of ''cywilydd arant ti!'' (or ''arnoch chi!'') 'shame on you!'

As a prefix, ''rhag-'' usually equates to English 'pre-' or 'fore-': ''rhagfarn'' 'prejudice', ''rhagweld'' 'foresee'.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

'''Inflected forms of ''rhag'''''

The table below gives the inflected forms of ''rhag'' with their accompanying pronouns:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

:{| class="wikitable"

| {{lang|cy|rhagddo fe/fo}}
| rowspan="2" | {{lang|cy|rhagddyn nhw}}
|-
! scope="row" | Feminine
| {{lang|cy|rhagddi hi}}
|}

Note that these inflected forms are often pronounced as ''rhactha i, rhacthat ti, rhacthi hi'' etc.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

===Rhwng===

''Rhwng'', which causes no mutation,&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; means 'between' and its usage is more-or-less the same as its English equivalent.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; Examples:
# ''Bydd y gêm rhwng Cymru a Lloegr yn cael ei haildrefnu'' 'The game between Wales and England will be rescheduled'.
# ''Dewch draw rywbryd rhwng tri a pedwar'' &lt;!-- The aspirate mutation of 'pedwar' to 'phedwar' has been omitted to reflect actual spoken Welsh, not to reflect the literary standard. Do not change! --&gt;  'come around between three and four''

Inflected forms of ''rhwng'' (which has the stem ''rhyng-'') are used to make idiomatic expressions like ''Rhyngddat ti a fi...'' and ''Rhyngddoch chi a fi...'' 'Between you and me...'.

'''Inflected forms of ''rhwng'''''

The table below gives the inflected forms of ''rhwng'' with their accompanying pronouns:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

:{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background: #efefef;"
| colspan="2" |

|-

| {{lang|cy|rhyngddo fe/fo}}
| rowspan="2" | {{lang|cy|rhyngddyn nhw}}
|-
! scope="row" | Feminine
| {{lang|cy|rhyngddi hi}}
|}

Note that these are often heard as ''rhyngtha i, rhyngthat ti'' etc.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; Also, variants using the stems ''rhwngdd-, rhynth-'' and ''rhyng-'' are in use.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

===Tan===

''Tan'', which causes soft mutation, means 'until, till' &lt;!-- Please note that UNTIL and TILL are correct forms. 'TIL with an apostrophe is a hypercorrection - do not change! --&gt; and is found with time expressions:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# ''Fyddwn ni ffwrdd tan fis Tachwedd'' – 'We'll be away till November'
# '''Dda i 'ma tan hanner awr wedi pedwar'' – 'I'll be here until quarter past four'

''Tan'' can also be used when taking leave of someone:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''Tan yfory 'te!'' 'Till tomorrow, then!', ''Tan hynny!'' 'Till then!', ''Tan y tro nesa!'' 'Till the next time!', ''Tan Ddydd Llun!'' 'Till Monday!' etc.

Where English 'until' is used as a conjunction, that is when it is followed by a whole phrase with a verb in it, then ''nes'' is the preferred translation:
# ''Na i aros tan ar ôl cinio'' – 'I'll wait until after lunch'
# ''Na i aros nes iddo ffonio'' – 'I'll wait until he phones'

However, ''tan'' can be heard to be used as a conjunction in some areas, so it is possible to hear (and therefore say) ''Na i aros tan iddo ffonio''; but there are also speakers who would consider this to be substandard&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; or "bad Welsh".

''Tan'' has no inflected forms.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

===Trwy===

''Trwy'' (also ''trw'' and ''drwy''&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;), which causes soft mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;, means 'through' in the spatial sense, e.g. ''cyllell boeth trwy fenyn'' 'a hot knife through butter', ''edrych trwy'r twll'' 'look through the hole'. ''Trwy'' also has other uses:
# When used with a verbal-noun, it equates to English 'by (means of)... ing':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
## ''Ceisiwch ymlacio trwy anadlu'n ddwfn am funud neu ddau'' – 'Try and relax by breathing deeply for a minute or two'
## ''Fedrwn ni ennill trwy ganolbwyntio'n fwy ar dactegau'' – 'We can win by concentrating more on tactics'
# When used with time expressions it means 'all' (not 'every' which is ''bob'' (&lt; ''pob'')):
## ''trwy'r dydd'' – 'all day'&lt;br /&gt;(''bob dydd'' – 'every day')
## ''trwy'r wythnos'' – 'all week'
## ''trwy'r flwyddyn'' – 'all year'&lt;br /&gt;In this sense ''gydol'' is sometimes heard with ''trwy'':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''trwy gydol y flwyddyn' 'all year' etc.

===Tua / tuag===

''Tua'' (''tuag'' before vowels&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;) causes the aspirate mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and means 'towards' in a spatial sense,&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; but this meaning has been taken over by ''tuag at'' in the modern language, except for set expressions like ''tuag adre'' 'home(wards)'. Its primary use in the modern colloquial language is for conveying approximation.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; For example, 'about' with both time and quantity expressions: ''tua naw o'r gloch'' '(at) about nine o'clock', ''tua pum pwys o datws'' 'about five pounds of potatoes'. With expressions of time ''tua/tuag'' can be replaced with the compound preposition ''o gwmpas'': ''o gwmpas naw o'r gloch''. Some examples of the use of ''tua/tuag'':
# ''Mae tua hanner y boblogaeth leol wedi ffoi'' – 'About half the local population have fled'
# ''Mae e tua'r un fath fel arfer'' – 'It's usually about the same'

''Tua/tuag'' has no inflected forms.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

===Wrth===

''Wrth'' causes soft mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; and is almost always heard as ''wth'' in normal speech&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; has a number of uses:

# In purely spatial expressions ''wrth'' means 'by' or 'at' where there is a sense of close proximity:
## ''Wrth y ddesg'' – 'By the desk'
## ''Mae rhywun wrth y drws'' – 'Someone is at the door'
# It also means 'by' when used after verbs of knowing or recognising:
## ''Nes i adnabod ti wrth dy ffordd o gerdded'' – 'I recognised you by the way you walk'
# After ''dweud ('' or ''deud)'' 'say, tell' and other similar verbs:
## ''Beth yn union wedest ti wrth y ferch druan?'' – 'What exactly did you tell the poor girl?'
# When used with a verbal-noun, ''wrth'' means 'while..... ing' and refers the action back to the subject:
## ''Pwy welson ni wrth ddod allan o'r siop ond dy gyn-wraig!'' – 'Who did we see (while) coming out of the shop but your ex!' [i.e. we were the ones coming out from the shop]
# ''Wrth'' means 'for' after ''rhaid'' 'need'. ''Rhaid wrth'' '..... is needed':
## ''Rhaid wrth gyfaddawdu mewn sefyllfaoedd felly'' – 'There is a need for compromise in such situations'
## ''Rhaid wrth gefnogaeth'' – '(We) need support; Support is needed'
# ''Wrth (i)'' is also a conjunction 'as, while':&lt;ref name="King1"&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Gareth |year=2016 |orig-year=1993 |chapter=Conjunctions |title=Modern Welsh – A Comprehensive Grammar |language=English |edition=Third |location=London and New York |publisher=Routledge |page=396 |isbn=978-1-138-82630-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
## ''Wrth i Iolo ddod allan, es i i mewn'' – 'As Iolo came out, I went in'
# ''Wrth'' can form a compound preposition ''wrth ymyl'' 'beside'.


'''Inflected forms of ''wrth'''''

The table below gives the inflected forms of ''wrth'' with their accompanying pronouns:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

:{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background: #efefef;"
| colspan="2" |
! scope="col" | Singular

| {{lang|cy|wrtho fe/fo}}
| rowspan="2" | {{lang|cy|wrthyn nhw}}
|-
! scope="row" | Feminine
| {{lang|cy|wrthi hi}}
|}

These inflected forms are routinely shortened to '''tha i, 'that ti'' etc. in speech in all parts of Wales,&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; especially after forms of ''dweud/deud'':
# ''Mae isio deud 'thyn nhw be' 'dy be', on'd oes?'' – 'They need telling what's what, don't they?' [Northern dialect]
# ''Be' wedodd hi 'thoch chi?'' – 'What did she say to you?'

Some idiomatic uses of ''wrth'':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;
# ''Wrth'' + a possessive adjective + ''bodd'' means 'delighted' or 'in one's element':
## ''Dw i wrth 'y modd'' – 'I'm as happy as can be'
## ''Mae e wrth ei fodd'' – 'He's in his element'
# The 3rd pers. sing. f. form ''wrthi'' is used with ''yn'' + a verbal-noun to mean 'busy..... ing':
## ''Mae'r plant i gyd wrthi'n codi castell tywod draw fan 'na'' – 'The kids are all busy building a sand castle over there'

===Yn===

''Yn'' causes nasal mutation&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; (though soft mutation is often heard instead&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;) and means 'in'. ''Yn'' 'in' is a true preposition and must not be confused with the complement marker particle ''yn'' seen after the verb ''bod''. It is only used when a definite (specific) noun follows (c.f. ''mewn''). ''Yn'' is therefore often seen preceding the definite article or the names of places: ''yn y car'' 'in the car' or ''yn Llandudno'' 'in Llandudno'. Compare the difference between the use of ''yn'' and ''mewn'': ''yn yr ardd'' 'in the garden' (specific), but ''mewn gardd'' 'in a garden' (non-specific).

'''Mutations after ''yn'''''

''Yn'' causes the nasal mutation, but it undergoes a change itself depending on what follows. Therefore ''yn'' often appears as ''ym'' and ''yng'', though ''ym'' only appears before a word beginning with 'm-' or 'mh-' and ''yng'' only appears before words beginning with 'ng-' or 'ngh-' whether this is the result of mutation or not:
# ''ym Mangor'' – 'in Bangor'
# ''yng Ngheredigion'' – 'in Ceredigion'
# ''yn Nolgellau'' – 'in Dolgellau'
# ''yng Ngogledd Cymru'' – 'in North Wales'
# ''ym mhwllheli'' – 'in Pwllheli'
# ''yn Nhalybont' – 'in Talybont'
# ''ym Machynlleth'' - 'in Machynlleth''
# ''yn Llandudno'' – 'in Llandudno'
# ''yn yr Alban'' – 'in Scotland'

The examples above are all place-names, but the rule holds true for all words following ''yn''.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; For example, ''yng nghanol y dre'' 'in the middle of the town'. It should be noted, however, that mutation of place names not of Welsh origin (often English) is often avoided, but not always. The following are all possible in colloquial Welsh for 'in Camden' (an area of London):
# ''yng Nghamden'' [Nasal mutation]
# ''yn Gamden'' [Soft mutation]
# ''yn Camden'' [no mutation]

It should also be noted that 'in Welsh' is always ''yn Gymraeg'', even in the literary language and is never ''*yng Nghymraeg''; it is sometimes heard as ''yn y Gymraeg'', it is because of this definite article being omitted that ''yn Gymraeg'' is used and not ''*yng Nghymraeg''.&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

'''Inflected forms of ''yn'''''

The table below gives the inflected forms of ''yn'' with their accompanying pronouns:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt;

Note that variants with ''-d-'' are often heard instead of ''-dd-'':&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''ynda i, yndo fe'' etc., as are variants with no linking element:&lt;ref name="KingPreps" /&gt; ''yna i, yno fe'' etc.

'''Cupid plc''' was the owner and operator of multiple high-volume [[online dating]] websites, covering the range from mainstream to niche audiences. The full network of websites is available worldwide in a variety of languages, and by the end of the first half of 2012 more than 54 million users had created profiles in the company's websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Dating Leader Cupid Sees Members Increase Six-Fold During First Half of 2012 |url=http://www.virtual-strategy.com/2012/06/20/online-dating-leader-cupid-sees-members-increase-six-fold-during-first-half-2012 |publisher=PRWeb |accessdate=13 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415084805/http://www.virtual-strategy.com/2012/06/20/online-dating-leader-cupid-sees-members-increase-six-fold-during-first-half-2012 |archivedate=15 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As is customary among all internet dating companies, all of their products are available across multiple devices (web, mobile, [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]]) and platforms (on [[web browsers]], within [[Facebook Platform|Facebook]]).

==History==

Founded in 2005 by Bill Dobbie and Max Polyakov, the company was originally made up of a range of dating websites operated from and off-shore base. In 2006, Polyakov and Dobbie acquired the EasyDate business and brand to complement and serve as an umbrella for their network of sites, which had been experiencing a steady growth in user base. The company quickly grew its user base – by 2007 they had their first million paying users, and a few years after that they hit an impressive 13 million paying users across all networks.

By early March 2010, the user base was growing at a rate of 300,000 per month, and new products were succeeding in increasing these numbers and expanding the user base. A year later, in May 2011, the company boasted 23 million members in 39 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ashcroft |first=Jamie |title=Cupid Plc says it's beating market expectations as online dating gains credibility |url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/28629/cupid-plc-says-its-beating-market-expectations-as-online-dating-gains-credibility-28629.html |publisher=ProActive Investors UK |accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was named as Scotland's fastest growing technology firm by [[Deloitte]] in its October 2011 Fast 500 listing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-15341387 |title=BBC News - Cupid named Scotland's fastest-growing technology firm |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in May 2012, went on to be awarded the UK Stock Market Awards 2012 award for Best Travel &amp; Leisure PLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stockmarketawards.com/winners/ |title=Winners &amp;#124; Stock Market Awards 2012 |publisher=Stockmarketawards.com |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This success, and the desire to fund further growth, prompted the company to become listed in the [[Alternative Investment Market]] of the [[London Stock Exchange]] (AIM). Upon admission, the company had an approximate market capitalisation of £45 million. The fresh capital brought about by the listing enabled the company to perform some strategic acquisitions in markets where it had detected potential, like France, Germany, the US, and Brazil. On 24 July 2012, Cupid plc announced that it had acquired the French dating site Assistance Genie Logiciel (AGL) for the sum of €3.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-18969004 |title=Cupid finds amour with French acquisition |publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal to buy the 1986-founded company includes French dating sites amour.com, serencontrer.com and ulla.com. Also in 2012 Cupid acquired Uniform Dating, a niche website aimed at uniformed services personnel such as firefighters, nurses, armed forces and police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Online dating firm Cupid buys uniform dating site |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-19597698 |newspaper=BBC News |date=14 September 2012 |accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BBC investigation===

In February 2013, the company was the subject of [[BBC Radio 5 Live|BBC Radio 5live Investigates]] programme. Users told the BBC that they had received many messages from potential dates as free users of the site but that, when they paid for membership to be able to reply, the volume of messages dramatically decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21366326|title=Online dating firm denies creating profiles to tempt clients |publisher=BBC News |date=24 February 2013 |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company denied that it was sending the messages to entice users to pay for membership and has commissioned an independent audit into its operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21904616 |title=Online dating firm Cupid plc sees share value plunge |publisher=BBC News |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a subsequent investigation into these claims, one of the sources of the accusations made a public apology regarding factual inaccuracies in his blog postings on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brontecapital.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/apology-to-cupid-plc.html |title=Source' apology to Cupid Plc |publisher=John Hempton |date=8 April 2013 |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigation by Ukrainian newspaper Kyivpost in March 2013 proved usage of fake profiles by the company and confirmed that the company's 'social media managers', whose job was to tempt users, were actually located in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine/deceptive-love-agency-hires-women-to-encourage-men-to-pay-321741.html|title=Deceptive Love: Agency hires women to encourage men to pay|publisher=Kyivpost}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-23409947|title=Concerns raised over web dating 'fake profiles'|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed that only about 20 employers of Cupid plc actually worked in the United Kingdom, and around 1500 staff members were located in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/544/147999.html|title=The insecurity of today's internet|publisher=Bizcommunity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company stated that its auditors KPMG had found 'no evidence of a company organised practice of staff enticing registered members to subscribe through the use of fake profiles'. Nevertheless, Cupid recognized that existing staff profiles 'were not clearly identifiable' to users and said it had replaced the motivation teams with dating advisors. In July 2013, BBC published new investigation, claiming that problem of fake profiles still existed, and the company used real persons' data without their knowledge.&lt;ref name=bbcnews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-23425366|title='I'm used to playing different people, but with my consent'|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such kind of semi-legal activities is a subject to legal prosecution in some countries. Björn and Benjamin Bak, founders of German dating application Lovoo, and twelve members of their staff were arrested and accused of commercial deception because of using similar scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20160608/police-arrest-founders-of-popular-berlin-dating-app-lovoo|title=Police raid premises of popular Berlin dating app|publisher=The Local}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avid Life Media]], founder of dating site AshleyMadison.com, was accused of using 'fembots' on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/ashley-madison-admits-tricking-men-with-fake-fembots/|title=Ashley Madison admits tricking men with fake fembots|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; British-based JDI Dating Ltd was fined by US Federal Trade Commission for using fake profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2815488/Dating-website-fined-using-fake-computer-generated-profiles-trick-users-spending-paid-memberships.html|title=Dating website fined for using fake computer-generated profiles to trick users into spending more on paid memberships|publisher=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and products==
Cupid's business can be split into two main areas: [[mainstream]] dating websites, aimed at the general public with some level of differentiation between them (for example, Cupid.com is aimed at people looking for a steady partner in a more long-term relationship, whereas BeNaughty.com is geared towards users looking for more [[casual relationship|casual dating]]); and niche websites, where the whole concept fundamentally hinges on the users looking for partners of a similar background and tastes.

The [[business model]] varies slightly depending on the website. In most cases, users can join for free – this gives them access to the website and allows them to browse the profiles of other users. Once they are ready to begin interacting with someone, the website charges depending on the level of access the user wants. This is a fairly common practice across the industry. Cupid makes most of their business through the charging of these fees, as there is no advertising on their websites.

In addition to this, Cupid also partners with other companies in order to provide a branded, specifically targeted [[online dating]] experience.

Cupid plc disposed of its casual dating sites in July 2013. It sold the remaining mainstream dating sites to [[NSI Holdings Ltd]]. in December 2014 and is no longer involved in online dating.

==Name change==
The company had been trading as EasyDate since 2006, when it acquired the name. Because of this, it was under that name that it became initially listed in the markets (as EasyDate plc). However, in December 2010, as a result of pressure from [[easyGroup]] founder Sir [[Stelios Haji-Ioannou]], the company changed its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Nick |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/sir-stelioss-arrows-turn-easydate-into-cupid-2159694.html |title=Sir Stelios's arrows turn EasyDate into Cupid |publisher=The Independent |date=14 December 2010 |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Cupid plc was chosen as it had been acquired in September of that year, along with all associated domains for £4.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Scuffham|first=Matt |title=EasyDate buys Cupid.com to kick off expansion |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/09/22/easydate-idUSLDE68L08820100922 |accessdate=14 November 2012 |newspaper=Reuters |date=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of Cupid plc==
The investigations by BBC and Kyivpost caused a sharp decline in the share prices. In Summer 2013, the company sold part of its 'casual dating business' to Grendall Investment Limited, controlled by co-founder and shareholder of Cupid plc Max Polyakov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-23319313 |title=Cupid plc sells 'casual dating business' for £45.1m |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Cupid plc suffered heavy losses and was forced to call in part of money owed by Grendall. The company preferred to take a reduced £12,5 million instead of around £20 million to get it a year earlier. Late Cupid plc announced that it sold final dating businesses for just £3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/tinder-breaks-cupids-heart-as-firm-completes-sale-of-dating-businesses-at-massive-discount-9910363.html |title=Tinder breaks Cupid's heart as firm completes sale of dating businesses at massive discount|publisher=Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/how-tinder-shot-down-cupid-9911664.html |title=How Tinder shot down Cupid |publisher=Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that assets were bought by the companies connected to Max Polyakov. Cupid pls was renamed Castle Street Investment and realigned as an investment company.

'''Daniel Kolak''' (born 1955 in [[Zagreb]], [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]]) is a [[Croatia]]n-American [[philosopher]] who works primarily in [[philosophy of mind]], [[personal identity]], [[cognitive science]], [[philosophy of science]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], [[philosophy of logic]], [[philosophy of religion]], and [[aesthetics]]. He is professor of philosophy at the [[William Paterson University]] of New Jersey and an Affiliate of the Rutgers University Center for Cognitive Science (RuCCS). Kolak is the founder of the philosophical therapy known as [[cognitive dynamics]].

==Biography==

Kolak is a prolific philosopher, with over thirty-five authored books and nearly two hundred books edited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpunj.edu/cohss/departments/philosophy/faculty/daniel-kolak.dot|title=Dr. Daniel Kolak|work=wpunj.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is professor of philosophy at the [[William Paterson University of New Jersey]] (WPUNJ), where he chaired the Philosophy Department and founded and directed the [http://www.wpunj.edu/cohss/departments/philosophy/the-philosophy-program/cogsci/ WPUNJ cognitive science laboratory]. He also directs research at the Brain Behavior Center and is an affiliate of [[Rutgers University]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20080509135833/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ruccs/ Center for Cognitive Science (RuCCS)]. Kolak's numerous articles, stories, essays, books and other creative works bridge traditional philosophy with all areas of inquiry and expression, from neuroscience to quantum mechanics, from logic and mathematics to art, music and literature. Among his best known recent works are ''I Am You: The Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics'', ''Principles of Cognitive Science'', ''[[Wittgenstein]]'s Tractatus'', ''Wisdom Without Answers'', ''From the Presocratics to the Present'', ''In Search of God: The Language and Logic of Belief'', ''The Experience of Philosophy'', ''Self, Cosmos, God'', ''Self and Identity'', and the novel ''In Search of Myself: Life, Death and Personal Identity''. He is editor, chief programmer and designer of the interactive electronic library ''The Philosophy Source'' on CD-ROM, and was Series Editor of the Wadsworth Philosopher Series and Philosophical Topics. As Series Editor at Longman, he is currently bringing out new editions of the complete canon of philosophy from ancient times to the present. Translated into over a dozen languages, collectively his books have sold over a million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croatia.org/crown/articles/8910/1/Famous-Croatian-American-Philosopher-Prof-Dr-Daniel-Kolak.html|title=Famous Croatian American Philosopher Prof. Dr. Daniel Kolak|work=croatia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kolak is the originator of the philosophy known as [[Open individualism|Open Individualism]], which he developed along with his view of metaphysical subjectivism and the nonlocality of consciousness, according to which there exists but one numerically identical individual subject who is everyone. In his groundbreaking ''I Am You: the Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics'', he writes: "The central thesis of ''I Am You'' - that we are all the same person - is apt to strike many readers as obviously false or even absurd. How could you be me and Hitler and Gandhi and Jesus and Buddha and Greta Garbo and everybody else in the past, present and future? In this book I explain how this is possible. Moreover, I show that this is the best explanation of who we are for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that it provides the metaphysical foundations for global ethics." Variations on Kolak's theme have been voiced periodically throughout the ages (the [[Upanishads]], [[Averroes]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Josiah Royce]]); more recently, physicists such as [[Erwin Schrödinger]], [[Fred Hoyle]], and [[Freeman Dyson]] have espoused it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kolak|first1=Daniel|title=I Am You: The Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics. (Volume 25 of the Synthese Library: Studies in Epistemology, Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science.)|date=2004|publisher=Synthese Library, Springer|location=Dordrecht, the Netherlands|isbn=1-4020-2999-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kolak continues to work on the logical foundations of quantum mechanics and a mathematical model of consciousness (e.g. Stone-Čech compactification) that integrates relativity and quantum mechanics using an "Ultra-Strong (Open World) Nonlocality" variation on a (spinning, with closed timelike paths) Gödel universe, and other such foundational issues in mathematics, physics and logic further refined with Jaakko Hintikka's IF ([[Independence-friendly logic|Independence-Friendly]]) and [[epistemic logic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eklund|first1=Matti|last2=Kolak|first2=Daniel|title=Is Hintikka's Logic First-Order?|journal=Synthese|date=2002-06-01|volume=131|issue=3|pages=371-388|doi=10.1023/A:1016184410627|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers; Springer Netherlands|location=The Netherlands|issn=0039-7857}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kolak|first1=Daniel|last2=Symons|first2=John|editor1-last=Kolak|editor1-first=Daniel|editor2-last=Symons|editor2-first=John|title=Quantifiers, Questions, and Quantum Physics: Essays on the Philosophy of Jaakko Hintikka|date=2004|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands|isbn=978-1-4020-3210-3|chapter=Forward and Acknowledgements (p. 1-2); The Results are in: The Scope and Import of Hintikka's Philosophy (p. 209-271)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also made original contributions to the philosophy of religion, the history of philosophy, and the teaching of philosophy.

Kolak is the founder of the philosophical therapy known as cognitive dynamics, which has been used to create new paradigms and technologies for expanding human consciousness, increasing intelligence, and improving creativity. It is still under development. More information about this aspect of Kolak's research in cognitive science (cognitive neuroscience; self-representation; information processing; knowledge representation; mental models; the logic and mathematics of mental processes; autism, confabulation, self-deception, MPD; dreaming), philosophy of mind (personal identity, consciousness, and self; philosophical psychology; psychoanalytic theory) can be found at the [http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ruccs/index.php/people/affiliates Rutgers University Center for Cognitive Science (RuCCS)].

Kolak is an expert on dreams, particularly about how the brain synthesizes experience and creates the virtual world we call reality. His unique work on lucid dreams has recently been featured in a documentary, produced by NBC/Universal, which aired in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Afterlife|journal=SCI FI Investigates [TV Show]|date=1 November 2006|volume=Season 1|issue=Episode 4|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0957186/?ref_=nm_flmg_slf_1|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a composer and musician he has performed in concert on numerous occasions, both solo and with leading musicians such as [[Charlie Byrd]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Frank Zappa]]. As a theatrical director and composer he has won the coveted [[Helen Hayes]] Creativity Award for productions such as [[Sartre]]'s ''[[No Exit]]'' at the Source Theater in Washington, D.C. Among his film work is the teleplay ''Id-Entity'', about multiple personality disorder as seen through the eyes of four patients, which Kolak wrote, directed, and produced, and the score and soundtrack for ''Forsaken Cries: the Case of Rwanda'' which he produced for [[PBS]], by [[Amnesty International]] and narrated by [[Danny Glover]]. Most recently Kolak served as special advisor to [[Martin Scorsese]] in the making of the [[Academy Award]]-winning film ''[[The Departed]]''.

In the United States, Kolak successfully lobbied the U.S. government on behalf of the children and retirees of the [[United Nations]] and its sister institutions the IMF and [[World Bank]]. As president and co-founder of the [[G-4 Coalition]] in Washington, D.C., Kolak helped write a bill, sponsored by US Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], allowing the children and retirees of the IMF and World Bank to become permanent U.S. residents. He testified before Congress and worked together with former World Bank President [[Robert S. McNamara]] to lobby successfully for the bill's passage. For his efforts on behalf of the international community living in the United States, he received a personal commendation from the Secretary General of the United Nations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9900">{{about|a declaration in the medical profession||Geneva Declaration (disambiguation)}}

The '''Declaration of Geneva''' (Physician's Pledge) was adopted by the General Assembly of the [[World Medical Association]] at [[Geneva]] in 1948, amended in 1968, 1983, 1994, editorially revised in 2005 and 2006 and amended in 2017.

It is a declaration of a [[physician]]'s dedication to the [[humanitarian]] goals of [[medicine]], a declaration that was especially important in view of the medical crimes which had just been committed in [[German-occupied Europe]]. The Declaration of Geneva was intended as a revision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wma.net/news-post/public-consultation-opens-on-wma-declaration-of-geneva/ |title=World Medical Association (2017) press release 12 May |publisher=Wma.net |date=2017-05-08 |accessdate=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Hippocratic Oath]] to a formulation of that oath's moral truths that could be comprehended and acknowledged in a modern way.&lt;ref name="wma.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-international-code-of-medical-ethics/|publisher=World Medical Association |title=International Code of Medical Ethics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920142540/https://www.wma.net/news-post/modern-physicians-pledge-approved-by-world-medical-association/ |archivedate=2017-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the case of the Oath of Hippocrates, the World Medical Association calls the statement a "pledge".

==Creation==
During the post [[World War II]] era and immediately after its foundation, the World Medical Association (WMA) showed concern over the state of medical ethics in general and all over the world, taking the responsibility for setting ethical guidelines for the world physicians. The details of the Nazi [[Doctors' Trial]] at Nuremberg which ended August 1947 and the revelations about what the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] had done at [[Unit 731]] in China during the war clearly demonstrated the need for reform, and for a re-affirmed set of guidelines regarding both human rights and the rights of patients.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

A study committee was appointed to prepare a "Charter of Medicine" which could be adopted as an oath or promise that every doctor in the world would make upon receiving his/her medical degree or diploma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wma.net/who-we-are/history/ |title=The Story of WMA/ who we are/History |publisher=Cirp.org |date=2002-06-06 |accessdate=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took two years of intensive study of the oaths and promises submitted by member associations to draft a modernized wording of the ancient oath of [[Hippocrates]] which was sent for consideration at the WMA's second general assembly in [[Geneva]] in 1948. The medical vow was adopted and the assembly agreed to name it the "Declaration of Geneva."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wma.net/en/60about/70history/index.html |title=WMA History |publisher=WMA |accessdate=2013-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206154153/http://www.wma.net/en/60about/70history/index.html |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This document was adopted by the World Medical Association only three months before the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948) which provides for the security of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/geneva/ |title=The Oath |publisher=Cirp.org |date=2002-06-06 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

===Changes from original===
The original oath read "My colleagues will be my brothers," later changed to "sisters and brothers." Age, disability, gender, and sexual orientation have been added as factors that must not interfere with a doctor's duty to a patient; some rephrasing of existing elements has occurred. Secrets are to remain confidential "even after the patient has died." The violation of "human rights and civil liberties" replaces "the laws of humanity" as a forbidden use of medical knowledge. "The health" in general of a patient is now the doctor's first consideration compared to the "health and life" as stated in the original declaration. This was apparently changed to free the medical profession from extending life at all cost.
The 68th WMA General Assembly in October 2017 approved revisions including: respecting the autonomy of the patient; mutual respect for teachers, colleagues and students  physicians to share medical knowledge for the benefit of their patients and the advancement of healthcare; a requirement for physicians to attend to their own health as well as their patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=World Medical Association |title=MODERN PHYSICIANS’ PLEDGE APPROVED BY WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION |url=https://www.wma.net/news-post/modern-physicians-pledge-approved-by-world-medical-association/ |publisher=WMA |accessdate= 14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the revised text is meant to be used by all active physicians ("as member of the medical profession") while before the text was used by beginners only ("At the time of being admitted as a member of the medical profession").

===Discussion about the declaration changes===
The Declaration of Geneva was originally adopted by the WMA General Assembly in 1948&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.wma.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Decl-of-Geneva-v1948.pdf, ''WMA'' , The modern Hippocritic Oath, April 1956]
&lt;/ref&gt; right after one year of the formation of World Medical Association,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wma.net/who-we-are/history/ ''World Medical Association'', The story of WMA]&lt;/ref&gt; and has undergone a series of amendments throughout the years, until 2006 and the latest amendments, made at the 68th WMA General Assembly in Chicago in October 2017, make several significant additions—most notably that, in order to provide a high standard of care to patients, doctors must look after their own health

The newly revised Declaration of Geneva, released in October, contains some modifications in terms of words throughout but also three entirely new points.:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-geneva/  ''World Medical Association'' WMA Geneva Declaration, 06 November, 2017]
&lt;/ref&gt;
*	I WILL RESPECT the autonomy and dignity of my patient.
*	I WILL SHARE my medical knowledge for the benefit of the patient and the advancement of healthcare.
*	I WILL ATTEND TO my own health, well-being, and abilities in order to provide care of the highest standard.

The new Geneva Declaration version gives respect to patient and the community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loebclassics.com/view/hippocrates_cos-oath/1923/pb_LCL147.299.xml;jsessionid=B19DB9EE3CEA5FEC9831C35DB1CADBFD,  ''Loeb''Classical library, 6 october 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2638728/The_Hippocratic_Oath_in_Latin_with_English_translation,  'Claude Pavur'' , 22 September 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4612">'''Desiring-production''' ({{lang-fr|production désirante}}) is a term coined by the French thinkers [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in their book ''[[Anti-Œdipus]]'' (1972).

==Overview==
Deleuze and Guattari oppose the [[Freud]]ian conception of the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] as a representational "theater", instead favoring a productive "factory" model: [[desire (psychoanalysis)|desire]] is not an [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] force based on [[Lack (manque)|lack]], but a real, productive force. They describe the machinic nature of desire as a kind of "desiring-machine" that functions as a circuit breaker in a larger "circuit" of various other machines to which it is connected. Meanwhile, the desiring-machine is also producing a flow of desire from itself. Deleuze and Guattari conceptualize a multi-functional universe composed of such machines all connected to each other: "There are no desiring-machines that exist outside the social machines that they form on a large scale; and no social machines without the desiring machines that inhabit them on a small scale&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9826668|title=Anti-Oedipus : capitalism and schizophrenia|last=1925-1995.|first=Deleuze, Gilles,|date=1983|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|others=Guattari, Félix, 1930-1992.|year=|isbn=0816612250|location=Minneapolis|pages=340|oclc=9826668}}&lt;/ref&gt;." Desiring-production is explosive: "there is no desiring-machine capable of being assembled without demolishing entire social sectors".

The concept of desiring-production is part of Deleuze and Guattari's more general appropriation of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s formulation of the [[Will to Power]].  In both concepts, a pleasurable force of appropriation of what is outside oneself, incorporating into oneself what is other than oneself,  characterizes the essential process of all life.  Similarly, a kind of reverse force of "forgetting" in Nietzsche and the [[body without organs]] in Deleuze and Guattari disavows the Will to Power and desiring-production, attempting to realize the ideal of an hermetic subject.

Thenceforth, while very interested by [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s fundamental question &amp;mdash; ''why did the masses desire fascism?'' &amp;mdash; they criticized his dualist theory leading to a rational social reality on one side, and an irrational desire reality on the other side. ''Anti-Œdipus'' was thus an attempt to think beyond [[Freudo-Marxism]]; and Deleuze and Guattari tried to do for [[Freud]] what Marx had done for [[Adam Smith]].

Published in the same year as ''Anti-Œdipus'', [[Guy Hocquenghem]]'s ''Homosexual Desire'' re-articulated desiring-production within the emergent field of [[queer theory]].

'''Dosan Seowon''' (alternatively, '''''Tosansowon''''') was established in 1574 in what is present day [[Andong]], South Korea, in memory of and four years after the death of [[Korean Confucian]] scholar [[Yi Hwang]] by some of his disciples and other Korean Confucian authorities. Yi Hwang had retired to the location in 1549 and begun construction on the facility, a private [[Seowon|Korean Confucian academy]] offering instruction in the classics and honouring the sages with regular memorial rites.

Like other Korean Confucian academies, Dosan Seowon serves two purposes: education and commemoration.  The site was well known in [[Korea]] as one of the leading academies and was home to the [[Toegye School of Thought]] for over 400 years.  Although the educational function of the facility has long since ceased, the commemorative ceremonies have been and are still held twice a year.

The ancient academy was royally chartered in 1575 by [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]] and was featured on the reverse of the South Korean 1,000 [[South Korean won|won]] bill from 1975 to 2007 ([[South_Korean_won#Banknotes_2|BOK Series Designation Series II (나) 1983–2002]]).

==Construction==

The Dosan Seowon complex consists of "Dosan Seodang" (lecture hall), which Toegye built and where he taught his students and where a tablet reading "Dosan Seowon", that was a gift from King Seonjo, still hangs, "Nongun Jeongsa," (dormitory for the students), and "Jeongyodang," (square lotus pond). 

Dosan Seodang is composed of three parts; an exposed floor, a large room, and a kitchen. As Toegye was not wealthy, it took him four years to complete the construction of this building. A small signboard reading "Dosan Seowon", whose calligraphy Toegye he himself wrote, still hangings on one of the pillars at the end of Dosan Seodang.

Looking carefully at the Dosan Seodang floor, you will see an extension made of wooden planks. One of Toegye’s students, Jeonggu, recommended that Toegye extend the building's floor to accommodate more students. But although Toegye turned down Jeonggu's recommendation, Jeonggu and his fellow students hastily attached wooden planks to the floor while Toegye was out. Consequently, this part of the floor is not very elegant in construction and appearance (see Gallery photo below).

The garden is small but Toegye dug a small square pond called "Jeongudang" in the eastern part of the compound where he raised lotus flowers, and planted apricot trees in the western part. Toegye used to call apricots, bamboos, chrysanthemums, and pine trees his "friends", but he loved apricot trees most.

His final words were, "Water the (ume) tree".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Herbert 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury by Larkin.jpg|thumb|Edward Herbert, by [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]], c.1609–10]]

'''Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury''' (or '''Chirbury''') [[Knight of the Bath|KB]] (3 March 1582 – 5 August 1648&lt;ref&gt;Herbert's date of death has been the source of confusion. The date 5 August appears in the burial registers of [[St Giles in the Fields]], and is corroborated by independent documentary evidence. However, his tombstone, erected some years later, apparently bore the date 20 August, and this date was subsequently accepted by many biographers. It is now believed to have been an error: see {{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=Dunstan |title=The death of Lord Herbert of Cherbury revisited |journal=Notes and Queries |volume=63 |issue=1 |year=2016 |pages=44–45 |doi=10.1093/notesj/gjv228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[Anglo-Welsh]] soldier, diplomat, historian, poet and religious philosopher of the [[Kingdom of England]].

==Life==

===Early life===
Edward Herbert was the eldest son of [[Richard Herbert, Lord of Cherbury|Richard Herbert]] of [[Montgomery Castle]] (a member of a collateral branch of the family of the [[Earl of Pembroke|Earls of Pembroke]]) and of Magdalen, daughter of [[Richard Newport (died 1570)|Sir Richard Newport]], and brother of the poet [[George Herbert]]. He was born within England at [[Eyton-on-Severn]] near [[Wroxeter]], [[Shropshire]]. After private tuition, he matriculated at [[University College, Oxford]], as a [[gentleman commoner]], in May 1596. On 28 February 1599, at the age of 14, he married his cousin Mary, then aged 21, ("notwithstanding the disparity of years betwixt us"&lt;ref&gt;''Autobiography''.&lt;/ref&gt;), who was daughter and heiress of [[William Herbert (MP died 1593)|Sir William Herbert]] (d. 1593). He returned to [[Oxford, England|Oxford]] with his wife and mother, continued his studies, and learned French, Italian and Spanish, as well as music, riding and fencing. During this period, before he was 21, he started a family.

Herbert entered Parliament as [[knight of the shire]] for [[Montgomeryshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] in 1601. On the accession of [[James I of England|King James I]] he presented himself at court and was created a [[Knight of the Bath]] on 24 July 1603. From 1604 to 1611 he was Member of Parliament for [[Merioneth (UK Parliament constituency)|Merioneth]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedford, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1605 he was magistrate and appointed [[High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire|sheriff]] in Montgomeryshire for 1605.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-HERB-EDW-1583.html ''Welsh Biography Online'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soldier===
[[File:Edward Herbert 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury by Isaac Oliver.jpg|thumb|Edward Herbert, [[miniature portrait]] c. 1613–1614 by [[Isaac Oliver]], now in [[Powis Castle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/1183954 |title=Sir Edward Herbert, later 1st Lord Herbert of Cherbury (1581/2–1648) |publisher=National Trust Collections, Places, Articles |accessdate=2 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1608, Edward Herbert went to Paris, with [[Aurelian Townshend]], enjoying the friendship and hospitality of the old [[Henri Ier de Montmorency|Constable de Montmorency]] at [[Merlou]] and meeting [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]]; he lodged for many months with [[Isaac Casaubon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedford, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; On his return, as he wrote of himself, he was "in great esteem both in court and city, many of the greatest desiring my company". At this period he was close to both [[Ben Jonson]] and [[John Donne]], and in Jonson's ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman]]'' Herbert is probably alluded to.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dutton (editor), ''Epicene, Or, The Silent Woman: By Ben Jonson'' (2003), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Donne and Jonson honoured him in poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Bedford, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1610, Herbert served as a volunteer in the [[Low Countries]] under the [[Prince of Orange]], whose intimate friend he became, and distinguished himself at the capture of [[Juliers]] from the emperor. He offered to decide the war by engaging in single combat with a champion chosen from among the enemy, but his challenge was declined. During an interval in the fighting he paid a visit to [[Ambrosio Spinola, marqués de los Balbases|Spinola]], in the Spanish camp near [[Wezel]], and afterwards to the [[elector palatine]] at [[Heidelberg]], subsequently travelling in Italy. At the instance of the [[Duke of Savoy]] he led an expedition of 4,000 [[Huguenots]] from [[Languedoc]] into [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] to help the Savoyards against Spain, but after nearly losing his life in the journey to [[Lyon]] he was imprisoned on his arrival there, and the enterprise came to nothing. Thence he returned to the [[Netherlands]] and the Prince of Orange, arriving in England in 1617.

===Diplomat===
In 1619, Herbert was made ambassador to Paris, taking in his entourage [[Thomas Carew]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=81305&lt;/ref&gt; A quarrel with [[Charles de Luynes|de Luynes]] and a challenge sent by him to the latter occasioned his recall in 1621. After the death of de Luynes, Herbert resumed his post in February 1622.

He was popular at the French [[Noble court|court]] and showed considerable diplomatic ability. His chief objects were to accomplish the marriage between [[Charles I of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]] and [[Henrietta Maria]], and to secure the assistance of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] for [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]]. He failed in the latter, and was dismissed in April 1624.

Herbert returned home greatly in debt and received little reward for his services beyond the Irish peerage of [[Castleisland|Castle Island]] on 31 May 1624 and the English barony of Cherbury, or [[Chirbury]], on 7 May 1629.

===Later life===
In 1632, Herbert was appointed a member of the council of war. He attended the king at [[York]] in 1639, and in May 1642 was imprisoned by the parliament for urging the addition of the words "without cause" to the resolution that the king violated his oath by making war on parliament. He determined after this to take no further part in the struggle, retired to Montgomery Castle, and declined the king's summons, pleading ill-health.

On 5 September 1644 he surrendered the castle, by negotiation, to the Parliamentary forces led by [[Thomas Myddelton (younger)|Sir Thomas Myddelton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=37605&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to London, submitted, and was granted a pension of £20 a week. In 1647 he paid a visit to [[Pierre Gassendi]] at Paris, and died in London the following summer, aged 65, being buried in the church of [[St Giles in the Fields]].

===Family===
Lord Herbert left two sons, [[Richard Herbert, 2nd Baron Herbert of Chirbury|Richard]] (c. 1600–1655), who succeeded him as [[Baron Herbert of Cherbury|2nd Lord Herbert of Cherbury]], and Edward. Richard's sons, [[Edward Herbert, 3rd Baron Herbert of Chirbury|Edward Herbert]] (d.1678) and [[Henry Herbert, 4th Baron Herbert of Chirbury|Henry Herbert]] (d.1691), each succeeded to the title, after which it became extinct. It was revived in 1694 when [[Henry Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Chirbury|Henry Herbert]] (1654–1709), son of Sir [[Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)|Henry Herbert]] (1595–1673), brother of the 1st Lord Herbert, was created Lord Herbert of Cherbury. Lord Herbert's cousin and namesake, Sir [[Edward Herbert (politician)|Edward Herbert]], was also a prominent figure in the [[English Civil War]].

==''De Veritate''==
Herbert's major work is the ''[[De Veritate]], prout distinguitur a revelatione, a verisimili, a possibili, et a falso (On Truth, as It Is Distinguished from Revelation, the Probable, the Possible, and the False)''&lt;ref&gt;''On Truth, as it is Distinguished from Revelation, the Probable, the Possible, and the False'') (Paris, 1624; London, 1633; translated into French in 1639 and into English in 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; He published it on the advice of [[Grotius]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/herbert.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''De veritate'', Herbert produced the first purely [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] treatise, written by an Englishman. Herbert's real claim to fame is as "the father of English [[Deism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.covenantseminary.edu/worldwide/en/CC310/CC310_T_24.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807174913/http://www.covenantseminary.edu/worldwide/en/CC310/CC310_T_24.html |archivedate=7 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The common notions of religion are the famous five articles, which became the charter of the English deists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/deismeng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sullivan-county.com/nf0/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Blount (deist)|Charles Blount]], in particular, acted as a publicist for Herbert's idea.

It has been placed on the [[index of forbidden books]] of the Catholic Church.

==Other works==
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Lord Herbert of Cherbury.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Lord Herbert of Cherbury by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]]]]
The ''De religione gentilium''&lt;ref&gt;Completed 1645, published Amsterdam, 1663, translated into English by William Lewis, London, 1705.&lt;/ref&gt; was a posthumous work, influenced by the ''De theologia gentili'' of [[Gerardus Vossius]], and seen into print by [[Isaac Vossius]]. It is an early work on [[comparative religion]], and gives, in [[David Hume]]'s words, "a natural history of religion." It is also to some extent dependent on the ''De dis Syris'' of [[John Selden]], and the ''Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim'' of [[Marin Mersenne]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedford, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; By examining pagan religions Herbert finds the universality of his five great articles, and that these are clearly recognisable. The same vein is maintained in the tracts ''De causis errorum'', an unfinished work on logical fallacies, ''Religio laici'', and ''Ad sacerdotes de religione laici'' (1645).

Herbert's first historical work was the ''Expedition Buckinghami ducis'',&lt;ref&gt;Published in a Latin translation in 1656 and in the original English by the [[Earl of Powis]] for the [[Philobiblon Society]] in 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; a defence of the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]]'s conduct on the [[La Rochelle expedition]] of 1627. ''The Life and Raigne of King Henry VIII'' (1649) is considered good for its period, but hampered by limited sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://historymedren.about.com/od/hentries/a/11_henryviii_4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

His poems, published in 1665 (reprinted and edited by [[John Churton Collins]] in 1881), show him in general a faithful disciple of Donne. His satires are poor, but a few of his lyrical verses show power of reflection and true inspiration, while his use of the metre afterwards employed by [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] in his "In Memoriam" is particularly happy and effective. His [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]] poems are evidence of his scholarship. Three of these had appeared together with the ''De causis errorum'' in 1645.

To these works must be added ''A Dialogue between a Tutor and a Pupil'',&lt;ref&gt;1768; a treatise on education, manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; which is of disputed authenticity;&lt;ref&gt;Upheld by Günter Gawlick in his 1971 facsimile edition, after this had been cast in doubt by Rossi.&lt;/ref&gt; and a treatise on the king's supremacy in the Church (manuscript in the Record Office and at [[the Queen's College, Oxford]]). His autobiography, first published by [[Horace Walpole]] in 1764, a naïve and amusing narrative, is much occupied with his duels and amorous adventures, and breaks off in 1624. Missing from it are his friendships and the diplomatic side of his embassy in France, in relation to which he described only the splendour of his retinue and his social triumphs.

He was a [[lutenist]], and ''Lord Herbert of Cherbury's Lute-Book'' survives in manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~wbc/julia/ch7/7a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Waligore, in his article "The Piety of the English Deists"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Waligore |first=Joseph |date=2012 |title=The Piety of the English Deists |journal=Intellectual History Review |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=181–197 |doi=10.1080/17496977.2012.693742 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that Herbert was one of the most pious of the deists, as he fervently prayed to God and believed God gave signs in answer to our prayers. He was so sure God answered our prayers that he said prayer was an idea God put into every human. He said that:

{{quote|every religion believes that the Deity can hear and answer prayers; and we are bound to assume a special Providence —to omit other sources of proof—from the universal testimony of the sense of divine assistance in times of distress.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, ''De Veritate'', 292–94, as cited in Waligore p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Herbert, this universal testimony of God answering our prayers meant that it was a common notion or something engraved into our heart by God.

Herbert was speaking from experience. In his autobiography, Herbert said he once prayed for and received a divine sign. He had written ''De Veritate'' and was wondering whether he should publish it. So he got down on his knees and prayed fervently to God for a sign instructing him what to do. Even though it was a clear, sunny day with no wind, Herbert said he heard a gentle noise in the clear sky that so comforted him that he decided it was a sign from God that he should publish his book. Herbert wrote:

{{quote|Being thus doubtful in my Chamber, one fair day in the Summer, my Casement being opened towards the South, the Sun shining clear and no Wind stirring, I took my book, ''De Veritate'', in my hand, and, kneeling on my Knees, devoutly said these words: "O Thou Eternal God, Author of the Light which now shines upon me, and Giver of all inward Illuminations, I do beseech Thee, of Thy infinite Goodness, to pardon a greater Request than a Sinner ought to make; I am not satisfied enough whether I shall publish this Book, ''De Veritate''; if it be for Thy glory, I beseech Thee give me some Sign from Heaven, if not, I shall suppress it." I had no sooner spoken these words, but a loud 'tho yet gentle Noise came from the Heavens (for it was like nothing on Earth) which did so comfort and cheer me, that I took my Petition as granted, and that I had the Sign I demanded, whereupon also I resolved to print my Book.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, ''The Life of Edward Lord Herbert of Cherbury'' (Dublin, 1771), 244–245, as cited in Waligore p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Herbert was attacked by orthodox Protestant ministers of the eighteenth century as a religious enthusiast. One minister, John Brown, said his claim to have received a sign from God was "enthusiastic".&lt;ref&gt;John Brown, ''A General History of the Christian Church'', 2 vols. (Edinburgh, 1771), 2: 278.&lt;/ref&gt; Another minister, [[John Leland (Presbyterian)|John Leland]], said even asking for such a sign was improper, as God does not become involved like that in people’s lives.  Leland said that Herbert’s claim "passed for a high fit of enthusiasm. ... I think it maybe justly doubted, whether an address of such a particular kind, as that made by his Lordship, was proper or regular.  It does not seem to me, that we are well-founded to apply for or to expect an extraordinary sign from heaven."&lt;ref&gt;John Leland, ''A View of the Principal Deistical Writers'', 3rd ed., 3 vols. (1757; reprint, New York: Garland, 1978), 1:25.&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly these two eighteenth-century Christian commentators did not see Herbert's understanding of God as distant and uninvolved. Rather, Herbert was attacked for believing in an overly-involved deity who had an overly-intimate relationship with people.

Modern scholars of deism often have difficulty fitting Herbert's religious views into their scheme of what deists believed. For example, [[Peter Gay]] said that Herbert – who lived in the early seventeenth century – was atypical of the later deists because Herbert thought he had received a divine sign.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Deism: An Anthology'' (Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., 1968), 30, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;  But Waligore argues that instead of saying Herbert was not a deist, we should change our notions about the deists and their relationship to God through prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Waligore 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides believing in prayers and divine signs, Herbert also believed in miracles, revelation, and direct divine inspiration. Herbert was so sure God performed miracles that he thought this doctrine, and the related notion that God answered our prayers, was an idea God put into every human.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, ''De Veritate'', 292–294, as cited in Waligore p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert said his emphasis on natural religion did not mean revelation was superfluous. He said he thought the Bible was a "surer source of consolation and support" than any other book and reading it stirred "the whole inner man" to life.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, ''De Veritate'', 316, as cited in Waligore, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert thought that divine inspiration generally happened through "the medium of spirits ... variously called angels, demons, intelligences and geniuses".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert of Cherbury, ''De Veritate'', trans. Meyrick H. Carre (Bristol: J. W. Arrowsmith, 1937), 308–309.&lt;/ref&gt; He said that we could be sure we had divine inspiration if we prepared ourselves for it and it met certain conditions. To begin with, said Herbert, "we must employ prayers, vows, faith and every faculty which can be used to invoke" the divine. Then "the breath of the Divine Spirit must be immediately felt" and the recommended course of action must be good. When these conditions were met, "and we feel the Divine guidance in our activities, we must recognize with reverence the good will of God".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert of Cherbury, ''De Veritate'', 308–9, as cited in Waligore p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eino Sakari Kaila''' (August 9, 1890 – July 31, 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date= 1978|title=Otavan Suuri Ensyklopedia |volume=4|trans-title= Otava’s Grand Encyclopædia |chapter=Kaila, Eino | language= fi |page =2539 |publisher= Otava Publishing Company |isbn= 951-1-04658-6}}&lt;!--|accessdate= 2014-07-10--&gt; In some reference books there is an incorrect death date 1958-08-01.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] philosopher, critic and teacher. He worked in numerous fields including [[psychology]] (sometimes considered to be the founder of Finnish psychology), [[physics]] and [[theater]], and attempted to find unifying principles behind various branches of human and natural sciences.

== Life ==
Eino Kaila was born in [[Alajärvi]], Finland. Kaila's father, [[Erkki Kaila]] was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Minister (religion)|minister]] and later [[archbishop]]. He graduated from the [[University of Helsinki]] in 1910. In the 1920s he worked in the field of [[literary criticism]] and [[psychology]] as a professor at the [[University of Turku]] and is said to have been the first to introduce [[gestalt psychology]] to Finland. He was a part of the cultural circles of the time with the likes of [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Frans Eemil Sillanpää]].  In  1916 he married the painter [[Anna Lovisa Snellman]], who was granddaughter of [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]]. He had University positions as lecturer in Helsinki and professor in Turku, and in 1930 he was appointed professor of theoretical philosophy at the University of Helsinki. In the 1930s, Kaila was closely associated with the  [[Vienna Circle]].&lt;ref name="BW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://authorscalendar.info/ekaila.htm |title=Eino Sakari Kaila (1890-1958) |last=Liukkonen |first=Petri |date=2008 |website=Books and Writers |publisher=Kuusankosken kaupunginkirjasto |access-date=27 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Kaila lectured in Germany.&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; In 1948 Kaila became a member of the [[Finnish Academy]]. He died in [[Kirkkonummi]] on July 31, 1958.&lt;ref name="HUM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://375humanistia.helsinki.fi/en/eino-kaila/more-about-eino-kaila |title=Eino  Kaila - a pioneering philosopher and psychologist, and a brilliant lecturer  |last=Hurmerinta |first=Riitta-Ilona |date=2015 |website=375 humanists |publisher=University of Helsinki |access-date=13 November 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideas ==
Despite being greatly influenced by the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] and critical of unempirical speculation, an aspect common to all of Kaila's work was in strive for a holistic, almost [[pantheism|pantheistic]] understanding of things. He also maintained a more [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] approach to psychology. His book ''Persoonallisuus'' (1934, Personality) was a psychological study with philosophical dimensions, in which emphasized the biological nature of psychological phenomena.  During the last years of his life he attempted to construct a [[theory of everything]] in ''Terminalkausalität Als Die Grundlage Eines Unitarischen Naturbegriffs'', but this, what was meant to be the first installment in a more extensive study, was not met with much enthusiasm outside of Finland.

Though he withdrew his support of the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] before the end of the Second World War, he wrote about the differences between "western" and "eastern" thought and claimed that the homogeneity of the people was a necessity for a functioning democracy.&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; After the war his close friendships with [[Edwin Linkomies]] and [[Veikko Antero Koskenniemi]] put a political shadow even over Kaila.&lt;ref name="AVOIN"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.avoin.helsinki.fi/oppimateriaalit/sosiaalipsykologia/kaila.htm |title=Eino Kaila (1934): Persoonallisuus  |last=Ahokas |first=Marja |date=2015 |website=Avoin yliopisto |publisher=University of Helsinki |access-date=13 November 2017 |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Kaila's most famous pupil was [[Georg Henrik von Wright]], who was the successor of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The tradition of highly German-influenced [[analytical philosophy|analytical]]-[[idealism|idealist]] philosophy which Kaila championed remained unchallenged in Finnish philosophy until the appearance of [[continental philosophy|continental]] influences in the 1980s. 

Kaila founded the psychological laboratory at the University of Helsinki, and educated the next generation of psychologists. He contributed to founding professorship in psychology, and to establishment of  the Faculty of Political Science together with [[Edwin Linkomies]].&lt;ref name="HUM"/&gt;

[[Embodied cognition]] occurs when an organism’s sensorimotor capacities (ability of the body to respond to its senses with movement), body and environment play an important role in thinking. The way in which a person’s body and their surroundings interacts also allows for specific brain functions to develop and in the future to be able to act.&lt;ref name=Cowart&gt;Cowart, M. (2005, Jul. 8 ). Embodied Cognition. http://www.iep.utm.edu/embodcog/&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that not only does the mind influence the body’s movements, but the body also influences the abilities of the mind, also termed the [[Bi-directional hypothesis of language and action|bi-directional hypothesis]].   
There are three generalizations that are assumed to be true relating to embodied cognition.  A person's [[motor system]] (that controls movement of the body) is activated when (1) they observe manipulable objects, (2) process action verbs, and (3) observe another individual's movements.&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, B. Z, and A. Caramazza. (2008). A critical look at the embodied cognition hypothesis and a new proposal. Journal of Physiology - Paris, 102 pp. 59–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Embodied [[semantics]] is one of two theories concerning the location and processing of sensory motors inputs within the human brain. The theory of embodied semantics involves the existence of specialized hubs where the meaning of a word is tied with the sensory motor processing unit associated with the word meaning. For example, the concept of kicking would be represented in the sensory motor areas that control kicking actions.&lt;ref name = Rueschemeyer&gt;Rueschemeyer, S. et al. (2010). Effects of Intentional Motor Actions on Embodied Language Processing. Experimental Psychology, 57 (4), pp. 260−66. doi:10.1027/1618-3169/a000031&lt;/ref&gt;   As a result, the theory assumes that individuals must possess a body to understand English.

== Neural Circuitry ==
The overlap between various semantic categories with sensory motor areas suggests that a common mechanism is used by neurons to process action, perception, and semantics. The correlation principle states that neurons that fire together, wire together. Also, neurons out of sync, delink. When an individual pronounces a word, the activation pattern for articulatory motor systems of the speaker leads to activation of auditory and [[Somatosensory system|somatosensory]] systems due to self-perceived sounds and movements. If a word meaning is grounded in the visual shapes of the objects, the word form circuit is active together with neural activity in the ventral-temporal visual stream related to processing of visual object information. Correlation learning links the word and object circuits, resulting in an embodied object-semantic relationship.

==Semantic Hubs==
A semantic hub represents a focal point in the brain where all semantic information pertaining to a specific word is integrated. For example, the color, shape, size, smell, and sound associated with the word “cat” would be integrated at the same semantic hub. Some candidate regions for semantic hubs include:
# Inferior Frontal Cortex: the anterior part of Broca’s area and adjacent tissue in the left Inferior Frontal Cortex including Brodmann’s areas 44, 45, and 47 are activated for semantic processing and functional changes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Superior Temporal Cortex: contains Wernicke’s area which controls the classic posterior language area in and adjacent to the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus. This area is thought to be a semantic processor on the basis of lesion, perfusion, and imaging data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Inferior Parietal Cortex: angular and adjacent to supramarginal gyrus in inferior parietal cortex is thought to be most strongly activated during semantic processing of cross-modal spatial and temporal configurations.
# Inferior and middle temporal cortex: a general semantic binding site between words and their meaning in left or bilateral medial/inferior temporal cortex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Anterior temporal cortex: thought to be involved in semantic dementia. which is a severe and specific semantic deficit characterized by lesions to both temporal poles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Semantic integration mechanisms involve various hub sites listed above, which contradicts the idea that there is one center where all integration occurs. However, each individual hub is compliant with the amodal model. Collectively, all of the hubs provide evidence for the theory that there are areas within the brain where emotional, sensory, and motor information all converge in one area.

==Semantic Category Specificity==
Each potential semantic hub is activated to a specific degree according to the category that the perceived word belongs to. For example, lesions to each of the five potential hubs do not affect all words. Instead, experimental data determines that one semantic category suffers more than another as it pertains to the word.
# Left Inferior Frontal Cortex and bilateral frontocentral motor systems: these two areas are strongly activated in response to action related words or phrases. Lesions to these two areas produces impairments in the processing of action related words and action related concepts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Bilateral superior temporal Cortex: this area is strongly activated in response to words related to sounds. Lesions to this area produce impairment in sound word processing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Left Inferior Parietal Cortex: especially near the supramarginal gyrus, this area is activated by spatial language. Lesions to the Inferior Parietal Cortex produced impairment involving spatial language such as prepositions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Medial/Inferior Temporal Cortex: this area is strongly activated by category-specific words animals, tools, person’s names, color, and form. Lesions show impairment in category-specific words for these categories as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Anterior Temporal Cortex: this area is associated with processing the differences between semantic categories.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Some of the category differences are thought to be produced by the adjacent hubs. For example, category specificity is greatest close to the piriform and anterior insular olfactory cortex. Here, odor words such as “cinnamon” lead to greater activation than control words. In the gustatory cortex in the anterior insula and frontal operculum, taste words such as “sugar” lead to a stronger activation.

==Experiential Trace Hypothesis==
Experiential Trace Hypothesis states that each time an individual interacts with the world, traces of that particular experience are left in our brain.&lt;ref name = ZwannPecher&gt;Zwaan R.A. &amp; Pecher, D. The grounding of cognition: The role of perception and action in memory, language, and thinking. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  These traces can be accessed again when a person thinks of words or sentences that remind them of that experience.  Additionally, these traces in our brain are linked to the action that they are related to.&lt;ref name = ZwannPecher /&gt;   Words and sentences become those cues that retrieve these traces from our mind.  Researchers have studied if the previous experience with a word, such as its location (up or down) in space, affects how people understand and then respond to that word.&lt;ref name = Lachmair&gt;Lachmair, M. et al. (2011). Root versus roof: automatic activation of location information during word processing. Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 18 pp. 1180–88. doi:10.3758/s13423-001-0158-x&lt;/ref&gt;  In one experiment, researchers hypothesized that if reading an object word also activates a location that is linked to that noun, then the following action response should be compatible with that association.&lt;ref name = Lachmair /&gt;  They found that participants were faster to push a button higher than another button when the word was associated with being "up" or "above" than when the button was lower than the other for words associated with "up" and "above".  The results of this study displayed that participants were faster to respond when the location of the word and the action they had to perform were similar.  This demonstrates that language processing and action are connected.  This research also found that the location information of a word is automatically activated after seeing the word.&lt;ref name = Lachmair /&gt;  In a similar study, it was discovered that participants were equally as fast at responding to words that were associated with either an upward or downward location when the buttons to respond to these words were horizontal – meaning that the experiential trace effect was ruled out when the responding action did not link to either of the locations that were activated.&lt;ref name="Zwann"&gt;Zwann, R. A. (2002). Language Comprehenders Mentally Represent the Shape of Objects. Psychological Science, 13 (2), pp. 168–71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experiential-Simulation Theory of Language Understanding===
Some theorists have proposed an experiential-simulation approach of language understanding. They argue that previous experiential traces related to a word may be reactivated at a later stage when accessing the meaning of the same word. This has been highlighted through the example of encountering the word ‘airplane’ in a situation where someone points to an airplane in the sky, thus making one look upwards. These experiential traces, e.g. ‘looking upwards’ are later reactivated when accessing the meaning of the word ‘airplane'. Similarly, another example might be when a person accesses the meaning of the word ‘snail’, they might also access experiential traces associated with this word, e.g. ‘looking downwards’ (likely towards the ground).&lt;ref&gt;Zwaan, R. A., &amp; Madden, C. J. (2005). Embodied sentence comprehension. Grounding cognition: The role of perception and action in memory, language, and thinking, 224-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language Comprehension and Motor Systems Involved in Action==

===Concrete verbs===
As a result of previous experience to certain words, several studies have found that the action associated with a certain word is also activated in the motor cortices when processing that same word. For example, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it was discovered that exposure to concrete action verbs referring to face, arm, or leg actions (e.g., to lick, pick, kick) activated motor regions that are stimulated when making actions with the foot, hand, or mouth.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hauk, O., Johnsrude, I., &amp; Pulvermüller, F. (2004). Somatotopic representation of action words in human motor and premotor cortex. Neuron, 41(2), 301-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstract verbs===
However, findings are not as clear cut when abstract verbs are involved. Embodied theories of language comprehension assume that abstract concepts, as well as concrete ones, are grounded in the sensorimotor system (Jirak et al., 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Jirak, D., Menz, M. M., Buccino, G., Borghi, A. M., &amp; Binkofski, F. (2010). Grasping language–A short story on embodiment. Consciousness and Cognition, 19(3), 711-720.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have investigated the activation of motor cortices using abstract and also concrete verbs, examining the stimulation of the motor cortices when comprehending literal action verbs (concrete) vs. the metaphorical usage of the same action verbs (abstract). One such study used fMRI to study participants whilst they viewed actions performed by the mouth, hand or foot, and read literal and metaphorical sentences related to the mouth hand or foot. This study found activation in the premotor cortex for literal action (e.g. “grasping the scissors”) but not for metaphorical usage (e.g. “grasping the idea”).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Aziz-Zadeh, L., Wilson, S. M., Rizzolatti, G., &amp; Iacoboni, M. (2006). Congruent embodied representations for visually presented actions and linguistic phrases describing actions. Current Biology, 16(18), 1818-1823.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that the assumption of embodied theories that abstract concepts, as well as concrete ones, are grounded in the sensorimotor system may not be true.

However, in contrast, other research has found motor cortex activation for the metaphorical usage of action verbs. One such study investigated cortical activation during comprehension of literal and idiomatic sentences using Magnetoencephalography (MEG). During a silent reading task, participants were presented with stimuli which included both literal and metaphorical arm-related action verbs, e.g. “Mary caught the fish” versus “Mary caught the sun”, and also literal and metaphorical leg-related action verbs, e.g. “Pablo jumped on the armchair” versus “Pablo jumped on the bandwagon”. This study found that processing of abstract verbs (idioms in this case) did indeed activate motor regions of the brain, activating anterior fronto-temporal activity very early compared to literal verbs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boulenger, V., Shtyrov, Y., &amp; Pulvermüller, F. (2012). When do you grasp the idea? MEG evidence for instantaneous idiom understanding. Neuroimage, 59(4), 3502-3513.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embodied Semantics Using fMRI for Concrete and Abstract Words===
Hauk and colleagues found that reading words associated with foot, hand, or mouth actions (examples: kick, pick, lick) activated by motor areas adjacent or overlapping with areas activated by making actions with the hand, foot, or mouth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, neurolinguist Tettmanti and colleagues found that listening to action related sentences activated the premotor cortex in a somatotopic fashion.&lt;ref name="Rueschemeyer" /&gt; Example: leg sentences showed premotor activity dorsal to hand sentences dorsal to mouth sentences.

Aziz-Zadeh and colleagues localized foot, hand, and mouth premotor regions of interest in each subject by having subjects watch actions associated with each effector and read phrases associated with the foot, hand, and mouth. In each subject, regions most activated for watching a foot action were also most active for language related to foot actions. The same was true for the hand and mouth. Rizzolatti and colleagues have suggested that action plan (manipulating, reaching) is more important than the actual effector involved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other studies have investigated activation of the motor system during comprehension of concrete and abstract sentences. Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and a behavioural paradigm, one study investigated whether listening to action-related sentences activated activity within the motor cortices. This was investigated using Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) from the TMS which were recorded from hand muscles when stimulating the hand motor area, and from foot and leg muscles when stimulating the foot motor area. Participants were presented with sentences relating to hand or foot actions. As control, participants listened to sentences containing abstract content. The study found there was indeed activation of the motor cortices whilst listening to sentences expressing foot/leg and hand/arm actions. This activation specifically concerned the areas of the motor system ‘where the effector involved in the processed sentence is motorically represented’ (pp.&amp;nbsp;360). Specifically, the results showed that listening to hand-action-related sentences prompted a decrease of MEP amplitude recorded from hand muscles and listening to foot-action-related sentences prompted a decrease of MEP amplitude recorded from foot muscle.&lt;ref&gt;Buccino, G., Riggio, L., Melli, G., Binkofski, F., Gallese, V., &amp; Rizzolatti, G. (2005). Listening to action-related sentences modulates the activity of the motor system: a combined TMS and behavioral study. Cognitive Brain Research, 24(3), 355-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Embodied Semantics in BA44 ==
Aziz-Zadeh found that although both action observation and reading phrases about actions caused activity in premotor and prefrontal regions in the vicinity of Broca’s area, the activated regions largely did not overlap. Activations for reading phrases were anterior and medial to activations for action observation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Aziz-Zadeh’s research contradicts that of Hamzei who stressed the overlap of language and action observation activations in the inferior frontal gyrus. However, the difference in results most likely was due to the difference in language tasks. Hamzei used a verb generation task that caused widespread activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and the premotor cortex. The action observation task led to a small activation area within the larger activation area. Therefore, Hamzei noticed the overlap between areas. Aziz-Zadeh used a less extensive frontal activation task which allowed for areas activated by reading and by action observation to be clearly distinguished.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)==
''See also:'' [[Bi-directional hypothesis of language and action|The Bi-Directional Hypothesis of Language and Action]]

Sentence processing can facilitate activation of motor systems based on the actions referred to in the sentence.  In one study, researchers asked participants to make judgments on whether a sentence was sensible or not.  For example, "You handed Courtney the notebook" versus "Courtney handed you the notebook".  They asked participants in one condition to push a button farther away from their body if the sentence was logical and a button close to their body when it wasn't logical.  The results of this study demonstrated that participants were faster at pushing the "sentence is logical" button when the action in the sentence matched the action required by them to push the correct button.&lt;ref name="Havas"&gt;Havas, D. A. et al. (2007). Emotion simulation during language comprehension. Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 14 (3), pp. 436−41.&lt;/ref&gt;  This means if the sentence read "you handed Courtney the notebook", the participants were faster to push the button that was farther away from them when this button meant the sentence was logical.   The depicted motion in these sentences affected the amount of time required to understand the sentences that described the motion that is in the same direction.  This effect has been shown to apply to sentences that describe concrete actions (putting a book on a shelf) as well as more abstract actions (you told the story to the policeman).&lt;ref name="GlenbergK"&gt;Glenberg, A. M, and M. Kaschak. (2002). Grounding Language in Action. Psychnomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 9 (3), pp. 558–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have tried to understand the ACE phenomenon by examining the modulation of motor resonance during language comprehension. In one study participants were asked to read sentences containing a frame of between one and three words. The participants had to rotate a knob, in one direction for half of the experiment and in the other direction for the other half. Each 5° of rotation induced the presentation of a new frame. Each of the sentences described actions involving manual rotation. In these, the rotation direction would or would not match the rotation direction implied by the sentence. Earlier studies, such as that by Glenberg &amp; Kaschak (2002), examined motor resonance in responses to sentences presumably given after the sentence was read. In contrast, results of this study revealed that motor resonance had dissipated before the end of the sentence, with motor resonance occurring on the verb. This study made use of comprehension questions rather than sensibility sentences. The researchers have argued that this created a more naturalistic reading situation, so it could be argued that the results of this study are deemed more suitable because they are in regards to more naturalistic language. Overall, the researchers have concluded that motor resonance is quite immediate and short-lived and that duration of the effect is modified by linguistic context.&lt;ref&gt;Zwaan, R. A., &amp; Taylor, L. J. (2006). Seeing, acting, understanding: motor resonance in language comprehension. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 135(1), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurophysiological evidence has also been presented to prove an ACE. This research used a behavioural paradigm as well as Event-Related Potential (ERP) to record brain activity, allowing the researchers to explore the neural brain markers of the ACE paradigm in semantic processing and motor responses. ERP was particularly beneficial in helping the researchers to investigate the [[Bi-directional hypothesis of language and action|bi-directional hypothesis of action-sentence comprehension]], which proposes that language processing facilitates movement and movement also facilitates language comprehension. In the study participants listened to sentences describing an action that involved an open hand, a closed hand or no manual action. They were then required to press a button to indicate their understanding of the sentence. Each participant was assigned a hand-shape, either closed or open, which was required to activate the button. As well as two groups (closed or open hand-shapes), there were three different categories relating to hand-shape: compatible, incompatible and neutral. Behavioural results from the study showed that participants responded quicker when the hand-shape required to press the response-button was compatible with the hand-shape inferred by the sentence. ERP results provided evidence to support the bi-directional hypothesis, showing that cortical markers of motor processes were affected by sentence meaning, therefore providing evidence for a semantics-to-motor effect. ERP results also demonstrated a motor-to-semantics effect as brain markers of comprehension were modified by motor effects.&lt;ref&gt;Aravena, P., Hurtado, E., Riveros, R., Cardona, J. F., Manes, F., &amp; Ibáñez, A. (2010). Applauding with closed hands: neural signature of action-sentence compatibility effects. PLoS One, 5(7), e11751.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Action-Compatibility Effect also states that the brain resources used to plan and carry out actions are also used in language comprehension; therefore, if an action implied in a sentence is different from the suggested response, there is interference within these brain resources.&lt;ref name = GlenbergK /&gt;

==Word Activation== 
Other studies have demonstrated that reading an object name interferes with how a person plans on grasping that object.&lt;ref name = Fischer&gt;Fischer, M., &amp; Zwann, R. (2008). Embodied language: A review of the role of the motor system in language comprehension. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 61(6), 825–50. doi:10.1080/17470210701623605&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also found that similar words can prime similar actions.  Playing the piano and using a typewriter both utilize similar motor actions; these words prime each other in a word decision task.&lt;ref name = Fischer /&gt;  These studies have concluded that activation of motor decisions occur automatically when exposed to action-related words.&lt;ref name = Fischer /&gt;

== Metaphorical Language ==
Aziz-Zadeh investigated congruent somatotopic organization of semantic representations for metaphorical sentences in either hemisphere. Aziz-Zadeh presented subjects with stimuli such as “kick the bucket” or “bite the bullet” to read and then followed by presenting subjects with videos of hand, foot, and mouth actions. Evidence could not be found in either hemisphere to support this theory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The metaphors used in the experiment are common in the English language however. Therefore, the argument stands that if a metaphor is heard often enough it will not activate the same network of processing that it did initially.

==Actions emphasize meaning==
Many studies have shown how body movements and speech can be combined to emphasize meaning (often called [[gesturing]]).  A person can observe the actions of another to help them comprehend what that person is saying.&lt;ref name="Gibbs"&gt;Gibbs, R. W. (2006). Language and Communication. Embodiement and Cognitive Science, pp. 158–207.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a person is pointing repeatedly, it helps the listener to understand that the direction being inferred is very important; whereas if it was a casual point in the general direction, the location of the object may not be as necessary to comprehend what the speaker is saying.  Another example may be the stomping of one’s foot.  This can help the listener to understand the anger and frustration being conveyed by the speaker.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Implications==
Many studies have demonstrated that people’s understanding of words and sentences can influence their movements and actions as well as the opposite – peoples’ actions can influence how quickly they can comprehend a word or sentence.&lt;ref name="Paradowski2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB |title=Storytelling in language teaching – re-evaluating the weight of kinaesthetic modality for brain-compatible pedagogy |journal=Storytelling: An Interdisciplinary Journal |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=13–52 |year=2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10407960/Storytelling_in_language_teaching_re-evaluating_the_weight_of_kinaesthetic_modality_for_brain-compatible_pedagogy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This knowledge is important for many reasons. One study looked at the impact of embodied cognition in a classroom setting to facilitate and enhance language learning.  For a child, there is a difference between oral language learning and reading. In oral language learning, the mapping between a symbol (word) and the object is common – often brought about by gesturing to the object.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG&gt;Glenberg, A. M, and A. Goldberg. (2011). Improving early reading comprehension using embodied CAI. Instructional Science, 39 pp. 27–39. doi:10.1007/s11251-009-9096-7&lt;/ref&gt; However, when a child is learning to read, they focus on the letter-sound combinations and the correct pronunciation of the words.  Usually, the object the words are referring to, are not immediately connected with the word so an association between the word and object isn't immediately made.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  The researchers of this study suggest the ''Moved by Reading'' intervention which consists of two parts – Physical Manipulation stage and an Imagined Manipulation stage.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  In physical manipulation, the child reads a sentence and then is instructed to act out that sentence with available toys.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  This forces the child to connect words with objects and their actions. In the imagined manipulation stage, the child reads the sentence and is then asked to imagine how they would interact with toys to act out the sentence.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  They studied this further and discovered that it is possible for these children to still benefit from the effects of embodied cognition when they manipulate objects on a computer screen.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  This embodied cognition software can help children facilitate language comprehension.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Other implications for language instruction that would enhance acquisition and retention are to offer activities which invite learners to actively use their body in the process, or at least observe the teacher doing so, thus activating their mirror neurons.&lt;ref name="Paradowski2014"/&gt;

{{Five Articles}}
{{Arminianism}}
The '''Five Articles of Remonstrance''' were theological propositions advanced in 1610 by followers of [[Jacobus Arminius]] who had died in 1609, in disagreement with interpretations of the teaching of [[John Calvin]] then current in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]].  Those who supported them chose to call themselves "[[Remonstrants]]".

==Background==
Forty-six preachers and the two leaders of the [[Leyden]] state college for the education of [[preacher]]s met in [[The Hague]] on 14 January 1610, to state in written form their views concerning all disputed [[doctrine]]s. The document in the form of a [[Wiktionary:remonstrance|remonstrance]] was drawn up by [[Jan Uytenbogaert]] and after a few changes was endorsed and signed by all in July.

The Remonstrants did not reject [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and [[catechism]], but did not acknowledge them as permanent and unchangeable [[canon law|canons]] of [[faith]]. They ascribed authority only to the [[Divine revelation|word of God]] in [[Holy Scripture]] and were averse to all [[Religious formalism|formalism]]. They also maintained that the secular authorities have the right to interfere in theological disputes to preserve peace and prevent [[Schism (religion)|schism]]s in the [[Christian Church|Church]].

The Five Articles of Remonstrance were subject to review by the Dutch National [[Synod]] held in [[Dordrecht]] in 1618–19 (see the [[Synod of Dort]]). The judgements of the Synod, known as the [[Canons of Dort]] (Dordrecht), opposed the Remonstrance with Five Heads of Doctrine. Each in answer to one of the Articles of the Remonstrance. It was this response which gave rise to what has since become known as the [[Five Points of Calvinism]]. Modified to form the acrostic TULIP they covered the soteriological topics within Calvinism, summarizing the essence of what they believe constitutes an orthodox view on each of sin: [[total depravity]], the basis of God's choice of the saved: [[unconditional election]], the application of the benefits of the atonement: [[limited atonement]], how the Holy Spirit brings man to repentance and faith: [[irresistible grace]], and the assurance that the saints will bring forth the fruits of the Spirit: [[perseverance of the saints]].

==The Five Articles==
The Five Articles of Remonstrance contrast with the [[Five Points of Calvinism]] on most points.  Article I disagrees that election into Christ is unconditional.  Rather, in this article the Remonstrants assert that election is [[conditional election|conditional]] upon faith in Christ, and that God elects to salvation those He knows beforehand will have faith in Him.  Article II espouses [[unlimited atonement]], the concept that Christ died for all.  This stands in contrast to the limited atonement of Calvinism, which asserts that Christ only died for those God chooses to be saved.  Article III affirms the [[total depravity]] of man, that man cannot save himself.  Article IV repudiates the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] concept of irresistible grace, contending that mankind has the [[Free will in theology|free will]] to [[Prevenient grace|resist]] God's [[Divine grace|grace]].  Article V, rather than outright rejecting the notion of perseverance of the saints, argues that it may be [[conditional preservation of the saints|conditional]] upon the believer remaining in Christ.  The writers explicitly stated that they were not sure on this point, and that further study was needed. The text of the articles is public domain (not copyrighted) and is provided below:

* '''Article I''' — That God, by an eternal, unchangeable purpose in [[Jesus Christ]], his Son, before the foundation of the world, hath determined, out of the fallen, sinful race of men, to save in Christ, for Christ's sake, and through Christ, those who, through the [[Divine grace|grace]] of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Ghost]], shall believe on this his Son Jesus, and shall persevere in this faith and obedience of faith, through this grace, even to the end; and, on the other hand, to leave the incorrigible and unbelieving in [[sin]] and under wrath, and to condemn them as alienate from Christ, according to the word of the [[Gospel]] in [[Gospel of John|John]] iii. 36: "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him," and according to other passages of Scripture also.
*'''Article II''' — That, agreeably thereto, Jesus Christ, the [[Salvation|Savior]] of the world, died for all men and for every man, so that he has obtained for them all, by his [[Death of Jesus|death on the cross]], [[salvation|redemption]], and the [[forgiveness]] of sins; yet that no one actually enjoys this forgiveness of sins, except the believer, according to the word of the Gospel of John iii. 16: "God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life"; and in the [[First Epistle of John]] ii. 2: "And he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world."
* '''Article III''' — That man has not saving grace of himself, nor of the energy of his [[Free will in theology|free will]], inasmuch as he, in the state of [[apostasy]] and sin, can of and by himself neither think, will, nor do anything that is truly good (such as having faith eminently is); but that it is needful that he be [[Born again Christianity|born again]] of God in Christ, through his Holy Spirit, and renewed in understanding, inclination, or will, and all his powers, in order that he may rightly understand, think, will, and effect what is truly good, according to the word of Christ, John xv. 5: "Without me ye can do nothing."
* '''Article IV''' — That this grace of God is the beginning, continuance, and accomplishment of a good, even to this extent, that the regenerate man himself, without that [[prevenient grace|prevenient]] or assisting, awakening, following, and co-operative grace, can neither think, will, nor do good, nor withstand any [[temptation]]s to [[evil]]; so that all good deeds or movements, that can be conceived, must be ascribed to the grace of God in Christ. But, as respects the mode of the operation of this grace, it is [[resistible grace|not]] [[irresistible grace|irresistible]], in as much as it is written concerning many that they have resisted the Holy Ghost,—[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|vii|KJV}}, and elsewhere in many places.
* '''Article V''' — That those who are incorporated into Christ by a [[faith in Christianity|true faith]], and have thereby become partakers of his life-giving Spirit, have thereby full power to strive against [[Satan]], [[sin]], the world, and their own [[flesh (theology)|flesh]], and to win the victory, it being well understood that it is ever through the assisting grace of the Holy Ghost; and that Jesus Christ assists them through his Spirit in all temptations, extends to them his hand, and if only they are ready for the conflict, and desire his help, and are not inactive, keeps them from falling, so that they, by no craft or power of Satan, can be misled, nor plucked out of Christ's hands, according to the word of Christ, John x. 28: "Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." But whether they are capable, through negligence, of forsaking again the first beginnings of their life in Christ, of again returning to this present evil world, of turning away from the holy doctrine which was delivered them, of losing a good conscience, of becoming devoid of grace, that must be more particularly determined out of the Holy Scriptures before they can teach it with the full persuasion of their minds.&lt;ref&gt;Text available in {{cite book| last=Bray| first=Gerald| title=Documents of the English Reformation| publisher=James Clark &amp; C°| location=Cambridge| year=1994| page=453,4}} note there is an error in the preamble which gives the year as 1615.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Counter-Remonstrance of 1611==
The Remonstrants' Five Articles of Remonstrance was met with a response written primarily by Festus Hommius, called '''The Counter-Remonstrance of 1611'''. The Counter-Remonstrance of 1611 defended the [[Belgic Confession]] against theological criticisms from the followers of late [[Jacob Arminius]], although Arminius himself claimed adherence to the [[Belgic Confession]] and [[Heidelberg Catechism]] till his death.&lt;ref&gt;Document translated in {{cite book| last=DeJong| first=Peter Y.| title=Crisis In The Reformed Churches: Essays in Commemoration of the Synod of Dort (1618-1619)| publisher=Reformed Fellowship, Inc.| location=Grand Rapids, Michigan| year=1968| pages=52–58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

1.	As in Adam the whole human race, created in the image of God, has with Adam fallen into sin and thus become so corrupt that all men are conceived and born in sin and thus are by nature children of wrath, lying dead in their trespasses so that there is within them no more power to convert themselves truly unto God and to believe in Christ than a corpse has power to raise itself from the dead; so God draws out of this condemnation and delivers a certain number of men who in his eternal and immutable counsel He has chosen out of mere grace, according to the good pleasure of his will, unto salvation in Christ, passing by the others in his just judgment and leaving  them in their sins.

2.	that not only adults who believe in Christ and accordingly walk worthy of the gospel are to be reckoned as God’s elect children, but also the children of the covenant so long as they do not in their conduct manifest the contrary; and that therefore believing parents, when their children die in infancy, have no reason to doubt the salvation of these their children.

3.	that God in his election has not looked to the faith or conversion of his elect, nor to the right use of his gifts, as the grounds of election; but that on the contrary He in his eternal and immutable counsel has purposed and decreed to bestow faith and perseverance in godliness and thus to save those whom He according to his good pleasure has chosen to salvation.

4.	that to this end He has first of all presented and given to them his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ, whom He delivered up to the death of the cross in order to save his elect, so that, although the suffering of Christ as that of the only-begotten and unique Son of God is sufficient unto the atonement of the sins of all men, nevertheless the same, according to the counsel and decree of God, has its efficacy unto reconciliation and forgiveness of sins only in the elect and true believer.

5.	that furthermore to the same end God the Lord has his holy gospel preached, and that the Holy Spirit externally through the preaching of that same gospel and internally through a special grace works so powerfully in the hearts of God’s elect, that He illumines their minds, transforms and renews their wills, removing the heart of stone and giving them a heart of flesh, in such a manner that by these means they not only receive power to convert themselves and believe but also actually and willingly do repent and believe.

6.	that those whom God has decreed to save are not only once so enlightened, regenerated and renewed in order to believe in Christ and convert themselves to God, but that they by the same power of the Holy Spirit by which they were converted to God without any contribution of themselves are in like manner continually supported and preserved; so that, although many weaknesses of the flesh cleave to them as long as they are in this life and are engaged in a continual struggle between flesh and Spirit and also sometimes fall into grievous sins, nevertheless this same Spirit prevails in this struggle, not permitting that God’s elect by the corruption of the flesh should so resist the Spirit of sanctification that this would at any time be extinguished in them, and that in consequence they could completely or finally lose the true faith which was once bestowed on them and the Spirit of adoption as God’s children which they had once received.

7.	that nevertheless the true believers find no excuse in this teaching to pursue carelessly the lusts of the flesh, since it is impossible that those who by a true faith are ingrafted into Christ should not produce the fruits of thankfulness; but on the contrary the more they assure themselves and feel that God works in them both to will and to do according to this good pleasure, the more they persist in working their own salvation with fear and trembling, since they know that this is the only means by which it pleases God to keep them standing and to bring them to salvation. For this reason He also employs in his Word all manner of warnings and threatenings, not in order to cause them to despair or doubt their salvation but rather to awaken in them a childlike fear by observing the weakness of their flesh in which they would surely perish, unless the Lord keep them standing in his underserved grace, which is the sole cause and ground of their perseverance; so that, although He warns them in his Word to watch and pray, they nevertheless do not have this of themselves that they desire God’s help and lack nothing, but only from the same Spirit who by a special grace prepares them for this and thus also powerfully keeps them standing.&lt;ref&gt;Document translated in {{cite book| last=DeJong| first=Peter Y.| title=Crisis In The Reformed Churches: Essays in Commemoration of the Synod of Dort (1618-1619)| publisher=Reformed Fellowship, Inc.| location=Grand Rapids, Michigan| year=1968| pages=209–213}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Félix Varela y Morales''' (November 20, 1788 – February 27, 1853) was a [[Cubans|Cuban]] [[Catholic]] [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|prelate]] and independence leader in his homeland who is regarded as a notable figure in the [[Catholic Church]] in both his native [[Cuba]] and the [[United States]].

==Life==
Varela was born in [[Havana]], Cuba, then still part of [[New Spain]], and grew up in [[St. Augustine, Florida]], the grandson of Lieutenant [[Bartolomé Morales]], the commander of military forces in [[Spanish Florida]], who was stationed there and who helped to raise Felix after the death of his mother in childbirth. As a teenager, he refused his grandfather's offer to send him to a military academy in Spain, returning to Cuba, where he studied to become a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] at [[San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary]] in Havana, the only seminary in Cuba.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/religion/faith-and-values/fl-fv-varela-venerable,0,6054999.story|first=James D.|last=Davis|title=Cuban priest: On a track to sainthood? Father Felix Varela declared 'venerable'|work=[[Sun Sentinel]]|date= April 10, 2012|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also studied at the [[University of Havana]]. At the age of 23 he was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] in the [[Cathedral of Havana]] for the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Cristóbal de la Habana|Diocese of San Cristóbal de la Habana]].

Joining the seminary faculty within a year of his ordination, he taught [[philosophy]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. In his position there, he taught many illustrious Cubans, including [[José Antonio Saco]], [[Domingo del Monte]], [[José de la Luz y Caballero]] and [[Felipe Poey]]. Referring to Varela, De la Luz said: "As long as there is thought in Cuba, we will have to remember him, the one who taught us how to think". [[José Martí]]'s teacher, [[Rafael María de Mendive]], was also Varela's student. During this period, Varela established a literary society and published ''Miscelánea filosófica'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dloc.com/?b=UF00081322&amp;v=00001 ''Miscelánea filosófica, escrita por el pbro. don Félix Varela y Morales'']&lt;/ref&gt; a popular book on philosophy, before he was 30 years old.&lt;ref name=SS /&gt;
[[File:Bust of Félix Varela.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bust of Félix Varela on the grounds of the University of Havana campus.|A [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Félix Varela on the grounds of the [[University of Havana]] campus.]]
In 1821 Varela was chosen to represent Cuba in the [[Cortes Generales]] of Spain in [[Madrid]], where he joined in a petition to the [[monarch|Crown]] for the [[independence]] of Latin America, and also published an essay which argued for the [[Abolitionism|abolition]] of [[slavery in Cuba]]. For such ideas, after the French invasion of Spain in 1823 overthrew the [[Trienio Liberal|liberal government]] of Spain and restored King [[Ferdinand VII]] who then brutally suppressed all opposition, he was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by the government. Before he could be arrested, however, he fled, first to [[Gibraltar]], then to the United States, where he spent the rest of his life, settling in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=SS /&gt;

In New York, Varela founded ''[[El Habanero]]'', the first [[Spanish-language]] newspaper in the United States, though it produced only seven issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Alfredo José|last=Estrada| title=Havana: An Autobiography | page=105| publisher=Palgrave Macmillan| year=2007|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published other newspapers in Spanish, including ''El Mensajero Semanal'', and also in English ''The Protestant's Abridger and Annotator''. He published many articles about [[human rights]], as well as multiple essays on [[religious tolerance]], cooperation between the English and Spanish-speaking communities, and the importance of education.

After spending some months studying English, he served as an assistant at [[St. Peter Catholic Church (Manhattan)|St. Peter's Church]] on Barclay Street from 1825 to 1827.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a19KAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=Rev.+Philip+O'Reilly+O.P.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Eenc-P1USx&amp;sig=5mUuoYE_iapefdRnifoQ6yZXhL4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB5MX84OzYAhWlc98KHYUODrgQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Rev.%20Philip%20O'Reilly%20O.P.&amp;f=false Corrigan, Michael. "Register of Clergy", ''Historical Records and Studies'', Vol. 2, United States Catholic Historical Society, 1901, p. 47]{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, Varela founded the Church of the Immigrant in the poor [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]]. The area later became known as [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] and the congregation as the [[Church of the Transfiguration, Roman Catholic (Manhattan)|Church of the Transfiguration]]. It continues to serve a largely immigrant community as of 2017, and it houses a memorial to Varela.&lt;ref name="Transfig"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.transfigurationnyc.org/parish/en/about-us/our-history|publisher=Church of the Transfiguration, NYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837, Varela was named [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Diocese of New York]], which then covered all of [[New York State]] and the northern half of [[New Jersey]]. In this post, he played a major role in the way the American Church dealt with the tremendous influx of Irish refugees, which was just beginning at the time. His desire to assist those in need coupled with his gift for languages allowed him to master the [[Irish language]] in order to communicate more efficiently with many of the recent Irish arrivals.

Varela served as a theological consultant to the committee of American bishops which drew up the famous [[Baltimore Catechism]], which began a standard teaching tool for Catholic children in the nation until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=SS /&gt; He was later awarded a [[doctorate of Theology]] by [[St. Mary's Seminary]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].

In 1848, worn out by his labors, Varela developed severe [[asthma]], which led him to retire to St. Augustine, dying there five years later.&lt;ref name=SS /&gt; Nearly sixty years after his death, Varela's body was dis-interred from [[Tolomato Cemetery]] and returned to Cuba to be laid to rest in the University of Havana's Aula Magna.

==Honors==
The Cuban government has created an award bearing his name, entitled the '''Orden Félix Varela''', which is given to those whom the government deems to have contributed to Cuban and worldwide culture. (See [https://web.archive.org/web/20041225084127/http://www.cubarte.cult.cu/global/loader.php?&amp;cat=premio&amp;cont=premiados.php&amp;premioid=41 List of people awarded the Varela award].)

His name is currently associated with a project proposed by the [[Christian Liberation Movement]] in Cuba, named [[Proyecto Varela]], which was announced to the Cuban people on government-owned TV and radio stations in Cuba by United States President [[Jimmy Carter]]. In 1997 the [[United States Postal Service]] honored Varela by issuing a 32-cent [[List of people on stamps of the United States#V|commemorative stamp]]. Because of his experiences, many in the [[Cuban American]] exile community identify with him.

===Places named after Varela===
* [[Felix Varela High School]], opened on August 28, 2000, in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], United States, is dedicated to the memory of Varela.
* "Varella Avenue" in St. Augustine, Florida, is a misspelled tribute to the priest who spent his early and last years there.
* "Padre Varela" street, more commonly known by its old name of Belascoaín, is a main north-south street in [[Centro Habana]].

==Cause for canonization==
Currently, Varela is being considered for [[canonization]] as a Catholic saint, and was declared a [[Servant of God]], recognizing his life as a devoted Catholic and a model for others in and out of the faith, and officially beginning the process.

On Easter Sunday, April 8, 2012, both the [[Archdiocese of New York]] and the [[Archdiocese of Miami]] (each having significant Catholic Cuban-American populations) announced that the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s [[Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] had declared Varela "[[Venerable]]", meaning he lived a virtuous life within the Catholic faith to a heroic degree and as such is worthy of praise (veneration).&lt;ref name=SS /&gt;

Now, for him to be [[beatified]], the next stage of the process, since he is not a martyr a miracle (officially deemed to be so from an impartial theological and scientific point of view) must be proved attributable to his direct intercession. Canonization would then follow if another such miracle is declared to have occurred after the first. If canonized, he would be the first Cuban-born person to be honored on the [[altar]]s of the Catholic church.

On October 30, 2015, Cardinal Jaime Ortega, Archbishop of Havana, appointed Archbishop [[Vincenzo Paglia]] as [[Postulator]] in the Process for Father Varela's [[Beatification]] and [[Canonization]].  Archbishop Paglia is also President of the Holy See's [[Pontifical Council for the Family]], as well as Postulator for the Process of Canonization of Blessed [[Óscar Romero]], the martyred Archbishop of San Salvador in El Salvador.

'''Gerald Ralph Fink''' (born July 1, 1940) is an American biologist, who was Director of the [[Whitehead Institute]] at MIT from 1990–2001.&lt;ref name=whitehead&gt;{{cite web |title=Gerald R. Fink, PhD |url=http://www.wi.mit.edu/research/faculty/fink.html |work=Faculty Profiles |publisher=Whitehead Institutute |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated from Amherst College in 1962 and received a Ph.D. from [[Yale University]] in 1965, having elucidated the histidine pathway in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  After postdoctoral study at the [[National Institutes of Health]] with Bruce Ames on the regulation of the histidine operon of Salmonella, in 1967 he joined Cornell University where he became a Professor of Genetics and pursued the study of the HIS4 region of yeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2781982 | pmid=19515841 | doi=10.1074/jbc.X109.029389 | volume=284 | title=Getting along with a little help from my friends | year=2009 | journal=J. Biol. Chem. | pages=23885–90 | last1 = Fink | first1 = GR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1982 he became a member of the Whitehead Institute and Professor of Genetics at MIT.  Dr. Fink was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] in 1981, to the [[Institute of Medicine]] in 1996, and to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2003.

Fink taught a course in the Molecular Biology of Yeast at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory for 17 years.  Many of these students as well as his university students went on to have successful careers in molecular biology.

In 1977, Fink and his students Albert Hinnen and Jim Hicks, discovered a method to [[transformation (genetics)|transform]] yeast cells, a procedure that allows scientists to introduce genetic material (DNA) from another organism into living yeast cells so that the expression and hereditability of the introduced DNA can be studied.&lt;ref&gt;"Transformation of yeast." Hinnen A, Hicks JB, and Fink GR, "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", 1978 Apr;75(4):1929-33. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC392455]&lt;/ref&gt;  This transformation procedure is not only essential for basic research, but is used to produce vaccines and other medically important products in yeast.&lt;ref&gt;Harman, Robin J. "Development and Control of Medicines and Medical Devices". Pharmaceutical Press, 2004, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Fink and his students discovered that bakers’ yeast could switch from a cellular form to a filamentous form.&lt;ref&gt;"Unipolar cell divisions in the yeast S. cerevisiae lead to filamentous growth: Regulation by starvation and RAS", Gimeno CJ, Ljungdahl PO, Styles CA, and Fink GR, "Cell", 1992 Mar 20;68(6):1077-90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feldmann, Horst. "Yeast: Molecular and Cell Biology". Wiley-VCH, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://gruber.yale.edu/genetics/gerald-fink&lt;/ref&gt;  This switch is important for many disease-causing fungi of both plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;Calderone, Richard A. and Cihlar, Ronald L. "Fungal Pathogenesis: Principles and Clinical Applications". CRC Press, 2002, p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Fink chaired a National Research Council Committee that resulted in a highly influential report, Biotechnology Research in an Age of Terrorism: Confronting the Dual Use Dilemma (http://download.nap.edu/cart/deliver.cgi?record_id=10827).   This report recommended practices that could improve the capacity to prevent the destructive application of biotechnology research while still enabling legitimate research to be conducted.

Fink has won the National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology  (1981), the Genetics Society of America Medal, (1982), the Emil Christian Hansen Award for Microbiology (1986), the George W. Beadle Award (2001),  and the Gruber Prize in Genetics (2010).

Fink is the husband of Rosalie Fink, an educator and author of books on learning disabilities.  They have two daughters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40353">The '''Gettier problem''', in the field of [[epistemology]], is a landmark [[philosophy|philosophical]] problem concerning our understanding of [[descriptive knowledge]]. Attributed to American philosopher [[Edmund Gettier]], Gettier-type counterexamples (called "Gettier-cases") challenge the long-held [[justified true belief]] (JTB) account of knowledge. The JTB account holds that knowledge is equivalent to justified true belief; if all three conditions (justification, truth, and belief) are met of a given claim, then we have knowledge of that claim. In his 1963 three-page paper titled "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?", Gettier attempts to illustrate by means of two counterexamples that there are cases where individuals can have a justified, true belief regarding a claim but still fail to know it because the reasons for the belief, while justified, turn out to be false. Thus, Gettier claims to have shown that the JTB account is inadequate; that it does not account for all of the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge.

The term "Gettier problem", "Gettier case", or even the adjective "Gettiered", is sometimes used to describe any case in the field of epistemology that purports to repudiate the JTB account of knowledge.

Responses to Gettier's paper have been numerous; some reject Gettier's examples, while others seek to adjust the JTB account of knowledge and blunt the force of these counterexamples. Gettier problems have even found their way into sociological experiments, where the intuitive responses from people of varying demographics to Gettier cases have been studied.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==History==
The question of what constitutes "knowledge" is as old as philosophy itself. Early instances are found in Plato's dialogues, notably ''[[Meno]]'' (97a–98b) and ''[[Theaetetus_(dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.  Gettier himself was not actually the first to raise the problem named after him; its existence was acknowledged by both [[Alexius Meinong]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], the latter of which discussed the problem in his book ''Human knowledge: Its scope and limits''.

Russell's case, called the stopped clock case, goes as follows:&lt;ref&gt;'Conditions of Knowledge' (1965). Chicago: Scott, Foresman&lt;/ref&gt; Alice sees a clock that reads two o'clock and believes that the time is two o'clock.  It is, in fact, two o'clock. There's a problem, however: unknown to Alice, the clock she's looking at stopped twelve hours ago.  Alice thus has an accidentally true, justified belief. Russell provides an answer of his own to the problem. Edmund Gettier's formulation of the problem was important as it coincided with the rise of the sort of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|philosophical naturalism]] promoted by [[W. V. O. Quine]] and others, and was used as a justification for a shift towards [[Internalism and externalism|externalist]] theories of justification.&lt;ref name="McGrews_on_Gettier"&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Routledge |publication-place = Abingdon, Oxon |author = Timothy McGrew |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24647810M/Internalism_and_Externalism |title = Internalism and Externalism |publication-date = 2007 }}, chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John L. Pollock]] and Joseph Cruz have stated that the Gettier problem has "fundamentally altered the character of contemporary epistemology" and has become "a central problem of epistemology since it poses a clear barrier to analyzing knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |isbn = 0-8476-8936-0 |publication-place = Lanham, Md |title = Contemporary theories of knowledge |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL31726M/Contemporary_theories_of_knowledge |author1 = John L.

[[Alvin Plantinga]] rejects the historical analysis:
{{Quote|According to the inherited lore of the epistemological tribe, the JTB [justified true belief] account enjoyed the status of epistemological orthodoxy until 1963, when it was shattered by Edmund Gettier...  Of course, there is an interesting historical irony here: it isn't easy to find many really explicit statements of a JTB analysis of knowledge prior to Gettier.  It is almost as if a distinguished critic created a tradition in the very act of destroying it.&lt;ref name="PlantingaWCD"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Alvin Plantinga|title=Warrant: The Current Debate|publication-date=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-507862-4|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite this, Plantinga ''does'' accept that some philosophers before Gettier have advanced a JTB account of knowledge, specifically [[C. I. Lewis]] and [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref name="PlantingaWCD" /&gt;

==Knowledge as justified true belief (JTB)==

The JTB account of knowledge is the claim that knowledge can be conceptually analyzed as justified true belief, which is to say that the ''meaning'' of sentences such as "Smith knows that it rained today" can be given with the following set of conditions, which are [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient]] for knowledge to obtain:

:A subject &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; ''knows'' that a proposition &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; is true [[if and only if]]:

:# &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; is true, and
:# &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; believes that &lt;var&gt;P &lt;/var&gt; is true, and
:# &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; is [[theory of justification|justified]] in believing that &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; is true

The JTB account was first credited to [[Plato]], though Plato argued against this very account of knowledge in the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' (210a). This account of knowledge is what Gettier subjected to criticism.

==Gettier's two original counterexamples==

Gettier's paper used counterexamples (see also [[thought experiment]]) to argue that there are cases of beliefs that are both true and justified—therefore satisfying all three conditions for knowledge on the JTB account—but that do not appear to be genuine cases of knowledge. Therefore, Gettier argued, his counterexamples show that the JTB account of knowledge is false, and thus that a different conceptual analysis is needed to correctly track what we mean by "knowledge".

Gettier's case is based on two counterexamples to the JTB analysis. Each relies on two claims. Firstly, that justification is preserved by [[entailment]], and secondly that this applies coherently to Smith's putative "belief". That is, that if Smith is justified in believing P, and Smith realizes that the truth of P entails the truth of Q, then Smith would ''also'' be justified in believing Q. Gettier calls these counterexamples "Case I" and "Case II":

===Case I===
: Suppose that Smith and Jones have applied for a certain job. And suppose that Smith has strong evidence for the following conjunctive proposition: (d) Jones is the man who will get the job, and Jones has ten coins in his pocket.

: Smith's evidence for (d) might be that the president of the company assured him that Jones would, in the end, be selected and that he, Smith, had counted the coins in Jones's pocket ten minutes ago. Proposition (d) entails: (e) The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.

: Let us suppose that Smith sees the entailment from (d) to (e), and accepts (e) on the grounds of (d), for which he has strong evidence. In this case, Smith is clearly justified in believing that (e) is true.

: But imagine, further, that unknown to Smith, he himself, not Jones, will get the job. And, also, unknown to Smith, he himself has ten coins in his pocket. Proposition (e) is true, though proposition (d), from which Smith inferred (e), is false. In our example, then, all of the following are true: (i) (e) is true, (ii) Smith believes that (e) is true, and (iii) Smith is justified in believing that (e) is true. But it is equally clear that Smith does not ''know'' that (e) is true; for (e) is true in virtue of the number of coins in Smith's pocket, while Smith does not know how many coins are in Smith's pocket, and bases his belief in (e) on a count of the coins in Jones's pocket, whom he falsely believes to be the man who will get the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gettier|first1=Edmund L.|title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?|journal=Analysis|date=1 June 1963|volume=23|issue=6|pages=121–123|doi=10.1093/analys/23.6.121|url=https://academic.oup.com/analysis/article-abstract/23/6/121/109949?redirectedFrom=fulltext|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case II===
: Smith, it is claimed by the hidden [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]], has a justified belief that "Jones owns a Ford". Smith therefore (justifiably) concludes (by the rule of [[disjunction introduction]]) that "Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Barcelona", even though Smith has no information whatsoever about the location of Brown.

: In fact, Jones does not own a Ford, but by sheer coincidence, Brown really is in Barcelona. Again, Smith had a belief that was true and justified, but not knowledge.

==False premises==
In both of Gettier's actual examples (see also [[counterfactual conditional]]), the justified true belief came about, if Smith's purported claims are disputable, as the result of entailment (but see also [[material conditional]]) from justified false beliefs that "Jones will get the job" (in case I), and that "Jones owns a Ford" (in case II). This led some early responses to Gettier to conclude that the definition of knowledge could be easily adjusted, so that knowledge was justified true belief that does not depend on [[false premise]]s.

==More general Gettier-style problems==

{{anchor|The sheep in the field}}In a 1966 scenario known as "The sheep in the field", [[Roderick Chisholm]] asks us to imagine that someone is standing outside a field looking at something that looks like a sheep (although in fact, it is a dog disguised as a sheep). They believe there is a sheep in the field, and in fact, they are right because there is a sheep behind the hill in the middle of the field. Hence, they have a justified true belief that there is a sheep in the field. But is that belief knowledge? {{anchor|Cow in the Field}}A similar problem which seeks to be more plausible called the "Cow in the Field" appears in [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]]'s book ''[[101 Philosophy Problems]]'', where it is supposed that a farmer checking up on his favourite cow confuses a piece of black and white paper caught up in a distant bush for his cow. However, since the animal actually is in the field, but hidden in a hollow, again, the farmer has a justified, true belief which seems nonetheless not to qualify as "knowledge". 

{{anchor|The Pyromaniac}}Another scenario by [[Brian Skyrms]] is "The Pyromaniac",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skyrms|first1=Brian|title=The Explication of 'X knows that p'|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=22 June 1967|volume=64|issue=12|pages=373–389|doi=10.2307/2024269|jstor=2024269}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a struck match lights not for the reasons the pyromaniac imagines but because of some unknown "Q radiation". 

{{anchor|Fake barns}}A different perspective on the issue is given by [[Alvin Goldman]] in the "fake barns" scenario (crediting [[Carl Ginet]] with the example).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldman|first1=Alvin I.|title=Discrimination and Perceptual Knowledge|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=18 November 1976|volume=73|issue=20|pages=771–791|doi=10.2307/2025679|jstor=2025679}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this one, a man is driving in the countryside, and sees what looks exactly like a barn. Accordingly, he thinks that he is seeing a barn. In fact, that is what he is doing. But what he does not know is that the neighborhood generally consists of many fake barns — [[Potemkin village|barn facades]] designed to look exactly like real barns when viewed from the road, as in the case of a visit in the countryside by [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of Russia, just to please her. Since if he had been looking at one of them, he would have been unable to tell the difference, his "knowledge" that he was looking at a barn would seem to be poorly founded. A similar process appears in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' as an example of [[Stranger in a Strange Land#Fair Witness|Fair Witness]] behavior.

The "no false premises" (or "no false lemmas") solution which was proposed early in the discussion proved to be somewhat problematic, as more general Gettier-style problems were then constructed or contrived in which the justified true belief does not seem to be the result of a chain of reasoning from a justified false belief.

For example:

: After arranging to meet with Mark for help with homework, Luke arrives at the appointed time and place. Walking into Mark's office Luke clearly sees Mark at his desk; Luke immediately forms the belief "Mark is in the room. He can help me with my logic homework". Luke is justified in his belief; he clearly sees Mark at his desk. In fact, it's ''not'' Mark that Luke saw; it was a marvelous hologram, perfect in every respect, giving the appearance of Mark diligently grading papers at his desk. Nevertheless, Mark ''is'' in the room; he is crouched under his desk reading [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]. Luke's belief that Mark is in the room is true (he is in the room, under his desk) and justified (Mark's hologram is giving the appearance of Mark hard at work).

Again, it seems as though Luke does not "know" that Mark is in the room, even though it is claimed he has a justified true belief that Mark is in the room, but it is not nearly so clear that the ''perceptual belief'' that "Mark is in the room" was inferred from any premises at all, let alone any false ones, nor led to significant conclusions on its own; Luke did not seem to be reasoning about anything; "Mark is in the room" seems to have been part of what he ''seemed to see''.

To save the "no false lemmas" solution, one must logically say that Luke's inference from sensory data does not count as a justified belief unless he consciously or unconsciously considers the possibilities of deception and self-deception. A justified version of Luke's thought process, by that logic, might go like this:
#That looks to me like Mark in the room.
#No factor, right now, could deceive me on this point.
#Therefore, I can safely ignore that possibility.
#"Mark is in the room" (or, "I can safely treat that as Mark").

The second line counts as a false premise. However, by the previous argument, this suggests we have fewer justified beliefs than we think we do.

==Constructing arbitrary Gettier problems==

The main idea behind Gettier's examples is that the justification for the belief is flawed or incorrect, but the belief turns out to be true by sheer luck. Thus, a general scenario can be constructed as such:

Bob believes A is true because of B. Argument B is flawed, but A turns out to be true by a different argument C. Since A is true, Bob believes A is true, and Bob has justification B, all of the conditions (JTB) are satisfied. However, Bob had no knowledge of A.

==Responses to Gettier==

The Gettier problem is formally a problem in first-order logic, but the introduction by Gettier of terms such as ''believes'' and ''knows'' moves the discussion into the field of epistemology. Here, the sound (true) arguments ascribed to Smith then need also to be valid (believed) and convincing (justified) if they are to issue in the real-world discussion about ''justified true belief''.
&lt;ref&gt;James Pryor. [http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/courses/epist2004/notes/gettier.html Theory of Knowledge - The Gettier Problem] (archive)&lt;/ref&gt;

Responses to Gettier problems have fallen into one of three categories:

* '''Affirmations of the JTB account:''' This response affirms the JTB account of knowledge, but rejects Gettier cases. Typically, the proponent of this response rejects Gettier cases because, they say, Gettier cases involve insufficient levels of justification. Knowledge actually requires higher levels of justification than Gettier cases involve.
* '''Fourth condition responses:''' This response accepts the problem raised by Gettier cases, and affirms that JTB is ''necessary'' (but not ''sufficient'') for knowledge. A proper account of knowledge, according to this type of view, will contain some fourth condition (JTB + ?). With the fourth condition in place, Gettier counterexamples (and other similar counterexamples) will not work, and we will have an adequate set of criteria that are both necessary and sufficient for knowledge.
* '''Justification replacement response:''' This response also accepts the problem raised by Gettier cases. However, instead of invoking a fourth condition, it seeks to replace Justification itself for some other third condition (?TB) (or remove it entirely) that will make counterexamples obsolete.

One response, therefore, is that in none of the above cases was the belief justified because it is impossible to justify anything that is not true.  Conversely, the fact that a proposition turns out to be untrue is proof that it was not sufficiently justified in the first place.  Under this interpretation, the JTB definition of knowledge survives. This shifts the problem to a definition of justification, rather than knowledge.  Another view is that justification and non-justification are not in [[binary opposition]].  Instead, justification is a matter of degree, with an idea being more or less justified.  This account of justification is supported by mainstream philosophers such as Paul Boghossian &lt;ref name="Boghossian on Justification"&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Clarendon Press |publication-place = Oxford, UK |author = Paul Boghossian |url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/fear-of-knowledge-9780199230419?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; |title = Fear of Knowledge: Against relativism and constructivism |publication-date = 2007 }}, Chapter 7, p 95-101.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTYzyzRt70&amp;feature=youtu.be] and [[Stephen Hicks]][https://web.archive.org/web/20141222000209/http://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/hicks-ep-full.pdf][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhK6XOT3uAA].  In common sense usage, an idea can not only be more justified or less justified, but it can also partially justified (Smith's boss told him X) and partially unjustified (Smith's boss is a liar).  Gettier's cases involve propositions that were true, believed, but which had weak justification.  In case 1, the premise that the testimony of Smith's boss is "strong evidence" is rejected.  The case itself depends on the boss being either wrong or deceitful (Jones did not get the job) and therefore unreliable.  In case 2, Smith again has accepted a questionable idea (Jones owns a Ford) with unspecified justification.  Without justification, both cases do not undermine the JTB account of knowledge.

Other epistemologists accept Gettier's conclusion. Their responses to the Gettier problem, therefore, consist of trying to find alternative analyses of knowledge. They have struggled to discover and agree upon as a beginning any single notion of truth, or belief, or justifying which is wholly and obviously accepted. Truth, belief, and justifying have not yet been satisfactorily defined{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}, so that JTB (justified true belief) may be defined satisfactorily is still problematical, on account or otherwise of Gettier's examples. Gettier, for many years a professor at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] later also was interested in the [[epistemic logic]] of [[Jaako Hintikka|Hintikka]], a Finnish philosopher at [[Boston University]], who published ''Knowledge and Belief'' in 1962.
[http://www.umass.edu/chronicle/archives/00/08-25/philosopher41.html]

===Fourth condition (JTB+G) approaches===
The most common direction for this sort of response to take is what might be called a "JTB+G" analysis: that is, an analysis based on finding some ''fourth'' condition—a "no-Gettier-problem" condition—which, when added to the conditions of justification, truth, and belief, will yield a set of necessary and jointly sufficient conditions.

====Goldman's causal theory====
One such response is that of [[Alvin Goldman]] (1967), who suggested the addition of a ''causal'' condition: a subject's belief is justified, for Goldman, only if the truth of a belief has ''caused'' the subject to have that belief (in the appropriate way); and for a justified true belief to count as knowledge, the subject must ''also'' be able to "correctly reconstruct" (mentally) that causal chain. Goldman's analysis would rule out Gettier cases in that Smith's beliefs are not caused by the truths of those beliefs; it is merely ''accidental'' that Smith's beliefs in the Gettier cases happen to be true, or that the prediction made by Smith: " The winner of the job will have 10 coins", on the basis of his putative belief, (see also [[Bundle theory|bundling]]) came true in this one case. This theory is challenged by the difficulty of giving a principled explanation of how an appropriate causal relationship differs from an inappropriate one (without the circular response of saying that the appropriate sort of causal relationship is the knowledge-producing one); or retreating to a position in which justified true belief is weakly defined as the consensus of learned opinion. The latter would be useful, but not as useful nor desirable as the unchanging definitions of scientific concepts such as momentum. Thus, adopting a causal response to the Gettier problem usually requires one to adopt (as Goldman gladly does) some form of [[reliabilism]] about justification. See ''Goldman''s [[Theory of justification]].

====Lehrer–Paxson's defeasibility condition====
[[Keith Lehrer]] and [[Thomas Paxson]] (1969) proposed another response, by adding a ''[[defeasibility]] condition'' to the JTB analysis. On their account, knowledge is '''''undefeated''' justified true belief'' — which is to say that a justified true belief counts as knowledge if and only if it is also the case that there is no further truth that, had the subject known it, would have defeated her present justification for the belief. (Thus, for example, Smith's justification for [[Epistemic modality|believing]] that the person who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket is his justified belief that Jones will get the job, combined with his justified belief that Jones has ten coins in his pocket. But if Smith had known the truth that Jones will ''not'' get the job, that would have defeated the justification for his belief.) However, many critics (such as Marshall Swain [1974]) have argued that the notion of a ''defeater'' fact cannot be made precise enough to rule out the Gettier cases without also ruling out ''a priori'' cases of knowledge {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.

====Pragmatism====
[[Pragmatism]] was developed as a philosophical doctrine by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S.Peirce]] and [[William James]] (1842–1910). In Peirce's view, the truth is nominally defined as a sign's correspondence to its object and pragmatically defined as the ideal final opinion to which sufficient investigation ''would'' lead sooner or later. James' [[William James#Epistemology|epistemological]] model of truth was that which ''works'' in the way of belief, and a belief was true if in the long run it ''worked'' for all of us, and guided us expeditiously through our semihospitable world.
Peirce argued that [[metaphysics]] could be cleaned up by a pragmatic approach.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Consider what effects that might ''conceivably'' have practical bearings you ''conceive'' the objects of your ''conception'' to have.  Then, your ''conception'' of those effects is the whole of your ''conception'' of the object.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 481 in Peirce, C.&amp;nbsp;S. (1905), "Issues of Pragmaticism", The ''Monist'', vol. 15, pp. 481–499, ''Google Book Search Beta'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;jtp=501 Eprint], ''Internet Archive'' [https://archive.org/details/monistquart15hegeuoft Eprint]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' v. 5 paragraphs 438–463, see 438, and in ''Charles S. Peirce: Selected Writings'', pp. 203–226)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From a pragmatic viewpoint of the kind often ascribed to James, defining on a particular occasion whether a particular belief can rightly be said to be both true and justified is seen as no more than an exercise in [[pedant]]ry, but being able to [[Decision making|discern]] whether that belief led to fruitful outcomes is a fruitful [[action (philosophy)|enterprise]]. Peirce emphasized [[fallibilism]], considered the assertion of absolute certainty a barrier to inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1899), "F.R.L." &amp;#91;First Rule of Logic&amp;#93;, unpaginated manuscript, c. 1899, CP 1.135–140. [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm Eprint] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106071421/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm |date=January 6, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1901 defined truth as follows: "Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1901), "Truth and Falsity and Error" (in part), pp. 718–720 in J.M. Baldwin. ed., ''[[James Mark Baldwin#dpp|Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]]'', vol. 2. Reprinted, CP 5.565–573.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, any unqualified assertion is likely to be at least a little wrong or, if right, still right for not entirely the right reasons. Therefore one is more veracious by being Socratic, including a recognition of one's own ignorance and knowing one may be proved wrong. This is the case, even though in practical matters one sometimes must act, if one is to act at all, with decision and complete confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1898), "Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", Lecture 1 of the Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, published in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' v. 1, paragraphs 616–48 in part and in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner (ed., intro.) and Putnam (intro., commentary), 105–22, reprinted in ''The Essential Peirce'', v. 2, 27–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revisions of JTB approaches===
The difficulties involved in producing a viable fourth condition have led to claims that attempting to repair the JTB account is a deficient strategy. For example, one might argue that what the Gettier problem shows is not the need for a fourth independent condition in addition to the original three, but rather that the attempt to build up an account of knowledging by conjoining a set of independent conditions was misguided from the outset. Those who have adopted this approach generally argue that epistemological terms like [[Theory of justification|justification]], [[evidence]], [[certainty]], etc. should be analyzed in terms of a primitive notion of ''knowledge,'' rather than vice versa. Knowledge is understood as ''factive,'' that is, as embodying a sort of epistemological "tie" between a truth and a belief. The JTB account is then criticized for trying to get and encapsulate the factivity of knowledge "on the cheap," as it were, or via a circular argument, by replacing an irreducible notion of factivity with the conjunction of some of the properties that accompany it (in particular, truth and justification). Of course, the introduction of irreducible primitives into a philosophical theory is always problematical (some would say a sign of desperation), and such anti-reductionist accounts are unlikely to please those who have other reasons to hold fast to the method behind JTB+G accounts.

==== Fred Dretske's conclusive reasons and Robert Nozick's truth-tracking ====
[[Fred Dretske]] (1971) developed an account of knowledge which he called "conclusive reasons", revived by [[Robert Nozick]] as what he called the ''subjunctive'' or truth-tracking account (1981). Nozick's formulation posits that proposition P is an instance of knowledge when:

#p is true
#S believes that p
#if p were true, S would believe that p
#if p weren't true, S wouldn't believe that p

Nozick's definition is intended to preserve Goldman's intuition that Gettier cases should be ruled out by disacknowledging  "accidentally" true justified beliefs, but without risking the potentially onerous consequences of building a causal requirement into the analysis. This  tactic though, invites the riposte that Nozick's account merely hides the problem and does not solve it, for it leaves open the question of ''why'' Smith would not have had his belief if it had been false. The most promising answer seems to be that it is because Smith's belief was ''caused'' by the truth of what he believes; but that puts us back in the causalist camp.

Criticisms and counter examples (notably the ''Grandma case'') prompted a revision, which resulted in the alteration of (3) and (4) to limit themselves to the same method (i.e. vision):

#p is true
#S believes that p
#if p were true, S ''(using M)'' would believe that p
#if p weren't true, S ''(using method M)'' wouldn't believe that p

[[Saul Kripke]] has pointed out that this view remains problematic and uses a counterexample called the ''Fake Barn Country example'', which describes a certain locality containing a number of fake barns or facades of barns.  In the midst of these fake barns is one real barn, which is painted red.  There is one more piece of crucial information for this example: the fake barns cannot be painted red.

Jones is driving along the highway, looks up and happens to see the real barn, and so forms the belief

*I see a barn

Though Jones has gotten lucky, he could have just as easily been deceived and not have known it.  Therefore it doesn't fulfill premise 4, for if Jones saw a fake barn he wouldn't have any idea it was a fake barn.  So this is not knowledge.

An alternate example is if Jones looks up and forms the belief

*I see a red barn.

According to Nozick's view this fulfills all four premises.  Therefore this is knowledge, since Jones couldn't have been wrong, since the fake barns cannot be painted red.  This is a troubling account however, since it seems the first statement ''I see a barn'' can be inferred from ''I see a red barn''; however by Nozick's view the first belief is ''not'' knowledge and the second is knowledge.

===Robert Fogelin's perspectival account===
In the first chapter of his book ''Pyrronian Reflexions on Truth and Justification''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.example Oxford, Oxford University Press], 1994&lt;/ref&gt;,  [[Robert Fogelin]] gives a diagnosis that leads to a dialogical solution to Gettier's problem. The problem always arises when the given justification has nothing to do with what really makes the proposition true. Now, he notes that in such cases there is always a mismatch between the information disponible to the person who makes the knowledge-claim of some proposition p and the information disponible to the evaluator of this knowledge-claim (even if the evaluator is the same person in a later time). A Gettierian counterexample arises when the justification given by the person who makes the knowledge-claim cannot be accepted by the knowledge evaluator because it does not fit with his wider informational setting. For instance, in the case of the fake barn the evaluator knows that a superficial inspection from someone who does not know the peculiar circumstances involved isn't a justification aceptable as making the proposition p (that it is a real barn) true.&lt;ref&gt;For a precise formulation of Fogelin's view, see Claudio Costa [http://www.example ''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''], CSP, 2014, ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
====Richard Kirkham's skepticism====
[[Richard Kirkham]] has proposed that it is best to start with a definition of knowledge so strong that giving a counterexample to it is logically impossible. Whether it can be weakened without becoming subject to a counterexample should then be checked. He concludes that there will always be a counterexample to any definition of knowledge in which the believer's evidence does not logically necessitate the belief. Since in most cases the believer's evidence does not necessitate a belief, Kirkham embraces skepticism about knowledge. He notes that a belief can still be rational even if it is not an item of knowledge. (see also: [[fallibilism]])

===Attempts to dissolve the problem===

One might respond to Gettier by finding a way to avoid his conclusion(s) in the first place. However, it can hardly be argued that knowledge is justified true belief if there are cases that are justified true belief without being knowledge; thus, those who want to avoid Gettier's conclusions have to find some way to defuse Gettier's counterexamples. In order to do so, within the parameters of the particular counter-example or [[wikt:exemplar|exemplar]], they must then either accept that

# Gettier's cases are not really cases of justified true belief, or
# Gettier's cases really are cases of knowledge after all,

or, demonstrate a case in which it is possible to circumvent surrender to the exemplar by eliminating any necessity for it to be considered that JTB apply in just those areas that Gettier has rendered obscure, without thereby lessening the force of JTB to apply in those cases where it actually is crucial.
Then, though Gettier's cases ''stipulate'' that Smith has a certain belief and that his belief is true, it seems that in order to propose (1), one must argue that Gettier, (or, that is, the writer responsible for the particular form of words on this present occasion known as case (1), and who makes assertion's about Smith's "putative" beliefs), goes wrong because he has the wrong notion of ''justification.'' Such an argument often depends on an [[externalism|externalist]] account on which "justification" is understood in such a way that whether or not a belief is "justified" depends not just on the internal state of the believer, but also on how that internal state is related to the outside world. Externalist accounts typically are constructed such that Smith's putative beliefs in Case I and Case II are not really justified (even though it seems to Smith that they are), because his beliefs are not lined up with the world in the right way, or that it is possible to show that it is invalid to assert that "Smith" has any significant "particular" belief at all, in terms of JTB or otherwise. Such accounts, of course, face the same burden as causalist responses to Gettier: they have to explain what sort of relationship between the world and the believer counts as a justificatory relationship.

Those who accept (2) are by far in the minority in analytic philosophy; generally those who are willing to accept it are those who have independent reasons to say that more things count as knowledge than the intuitions that led to the JTB account would acknowledge. Chief among these are [[epistemic minimalism|epistemic minimalists]] such as [[Crispin Sartwell]], who hold that all true belief, including both Gettier's cases and lucky guesses, counts as knowledge.

===Experimental research===

Some early work in the field of [[experimental philosophy]] suggested that traditional intuitions about Gettier cases might vary cross-culturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinberg|first1=Jonathan M.|last2=Nichols|first2=Shaun|last3=Stich|first3=Stephen|title=Normativity and Epistemic Intuitions|journal=Philosophical Topics|date=Spring–Fall 2001|volume=29|issue=1–2|pages=429–460|doi=10.5840/philtopics2001291/217}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent studies have consistently failed to replicate these results, instead finding that participants from different cultures do share the traditional intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Minsun|last2=Yuan|first2=Yuan|title=No cross-cultural differences in the Gettier car case intuition: A replication study of Weinberg et al. 2001|journal=Episteme|date=2015|volume=12|issue=3|pages=355–361|doi=10.1017/epi.2015.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seyedsayamdost|first1=Hamid|title=On Normativity and Epistemic Intuitions: Failure of Replication|journal=Episteme|date=2014|volume=12|issue=1|pages=95–116|doi=10.1017/epi.2014.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nagel|first1=Jennifer|title=Intuitions and Experiments: A Defense of the Case Method in Epistemology|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=November 2012|volume=85|issue=3|pages=495–527|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2012.00634.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, more recent studies have actually been providing evidence for the opposite hypothesis, that people from a variety of different cultures have surprisingly similar intuitions in these cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Machery|first1=Edouard|last2=Stich|first2=Stephen|last3=Rose|first3=David|last4=Chatterjee|first4=Amita|last5=Karasawa|first5=Kaori|last6=Struchiner|first6=Noel|last7=Sirker|first7=Smita|last8=Usui|first8=Naoki|last9=Hashimoto|first9=Takaaki|title=Gettier Across Cultures|journal=Noûs|date=August 2015|doi=10.1111/nous.12110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ignorance''' is a lack of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ignorance|title=Ignorance|last=|first=|date=|website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ignorant|title=Ignorant meaning|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Dictionary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ignorant is an adjective that describes a person in the state of being [[Awareness|unaware]], and can describe individuals who deliberately ignore or disregard important information or facts, or individuals who are unaware of important information or facts. Ignorance can appear in three different types: factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), objectual ignorance (unacquaintance with some object), and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge of how to do something).&lt;ref&gt;Nottelmann, Nikolaj. "ignorance." ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', edited by Robert Audi, Cambridge University Press, 3rd edition, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for ignorance ==
People do not experience instant gratification and therefore they do not invest time and effort in learning and developing. Eradicating ignorance completely from an individual’s life is an impossible task but reducing the gap can truly benefit the individual in a long term.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, Bryan, and BRYAN CAPLAN. "Rational Ignorance." ''The Encyclopedia of Public Choice'', edited by Charles K. Rowley, and Friedrich Schneider, Springer Science+Business Media, 1st edition, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, making the decision to remain ignorant by committing to an ideology despite scientific proof is a dangerous mindset that can inhibit an individual from discovering the truth and therefore developing as an individual.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, Lee. "The attack on truth: we have entered an age of willful ignorance." ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', 12 June 2015, p. B10+.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignorance can stifle learning, especially if the ignorant person believes it is not ignorant. A person who falsely believes it is knowledgeable, does not try to clarify its beliefs, but rather relies on the ignorant position. It may also reject valid but contrary information, neither realizing its importance nor understanding it. This concept is elucidated in Justin Kruger and [[David Dunning]]'s work, "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments"{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}, otherwise known as the [[Dunning–Kruger effect]].

Another reason why people are not able to obtain knowledge is inaccessibility to education. In some parts of the world, educational infrastructure is insufficient and therefore people are not able to seek for knowledge. The phenomenon can be observed widely in underdeveloped countries where many children either cannot afford to go to school or live too far from a school. On the other hand, in developed countries most children have access to a K12 education but once they graduate high school they encounter obstacles to pursue a higher education due to high costs. This lack of education can contribute to individuals not being able to practice critical thinking and seek for knowledge for themselves.

==Consequences==
Remaining in a state of ignorance can lead to serious economic downfalls, relationship crises, legal issues, and more. It is important for human survival to be knowledgeable on different topics. For example, one must be aware of ways to prevent certain diseases, avoid certain poisonous foods, avoid war, etc..

Individuals who are financially literate can manage finances wisely and therefore create a more stable life for themselves and their families. People who understand finance and economics can vote better on local and national economic regulations that benefit the whole society.

Another important aspect is ignorance in the legal field. People must be aware of laws so they can live free and in harmony with others. Ignorance of the law is not accepted as a legal defense, so it is the responsibility of the individual to know the law. Willingly ignoring the law can lead to arrest or isolated living.

Ignorance can have a negative effects on individuals and societies, but can also benefit them by creating within them the desire to know more. For example, ignorance within science opens the opportunity to seek knowledge and make discoveries by asking new questions.&lt;ref&gt;[null Firestein], Stuart. ''Ignorance: How It Drives Science''. Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This though can only take place if the individual possesses a curious mind.

Studies suggest that adults with an adequate education who perform enriching and challenging jobs are happier, and more in control of their environment.&lt;ref&gt;Schieman, Scott and Gabriele Plickert. "How Knowledge Is Power: Education and the Sense of Control." ''Social Forces'', vol. 87, no. 1, Sept. 2008, pp. 153-183.&lt;/ref&gt; The confidence that adults obtain through the sense of control that education provides allows those adults to go for more leadership positions and seek for power throughout their lives.

The writer, [[Thomas Pynchon]], articulated the following about the scope and structure of one's ignorance: "Ignorance is not just a blank space on a person's mental map. It has contours and coherence, and for all I know rules of operation as well. So as a corollary to [the advice of] writing about what we know, maybe we should add getting familiar with our ignorance, and the possibilities therein for writing a good story."{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

He is perhaps best known for his writings on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], and his association with the [[New Wittgenstein]] school of Wittgenstein interpretation initiated by [[Cora Diamond]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New Wittgenstein.'' [[Alice Crary]] and Rupert Read (eds.). Routledge, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  He is currently Chester D.

==Life==
Conant was born in [[Kyoto, Japan]] to American parents. He is the grandson of former Harvard University president [[James Bryant Conant]]. At 14, he attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]].  He received his A.B. in Philosophy and History of Science from [[Harvard College]] in 1982, and his Ph.D. in Philosophy from [[Harvard University]] in 1990. He joined the philosophy faculty at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1990-1999, and then became Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]]. In December, 2012, he became co-director of the Center for Analytic German Idealism&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; at Leipzig University, and in July, 2017 he was appointed Humboldt Professor of Philosophy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sozphil.uni-leipzig.de/cm/philosophie/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-james-ferguson-conant/|title=Prof. Dr. James Ferguson Conant {{!}} Philosophie|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sozphil.uni-leipzig.de|language=de-DE|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Leipzig University.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release of 27.10.2016|url=http://www.uni-leipzig.de/service/kommunikation/medienredaktion/nachrichten.html?ifab_modus=detail&amp;ifab_id=6813|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
Since the mid 1990s Conant, together with  [[Cora Diamond]] has advanced a “resolute reading” of Wittgenstein's early work which seeks to expose neglected underlying continuities between the philosopher's early and later approaches to philosophy, especially between his early ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' and his later ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''. This resolute reading is meant to show that even in the ''Tractatus'', the purpose of philosophy is the clarification of philosophical problems, aimed at the elucidation of the sentences of the language through which we express ourselves rather than at propounding philosophical theses.&lt;ref name="Conant and Diamond"&gt;Conant, James and Diamond, Cora "On reading the Tractatus Resolutely", in ''The Lasting Significance of Wittgenstein's Philosophy'', edited by Max Kölbel and Bernhard Weiss, Routledge, 2004. [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fphilosophy.uchicago.edu%2Ffaculty%2Ffiles%2Fconant%2F03ConantDiamond.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This reading subjects the traditional interpretations of Wittgenstein, particularly that of [[Peter Hacker]] and [[Gordon Baker]], to severe criticism.  Hacker, as well as others like [[Ian Proops]] and [[Michael Forster]] have in turn criticized Conant's representation of them.&lt;ref name=Controversy&gt;The controversy has been pursued especially in the form of contributions to a series of collections of essays devoted to the topic, the most influential of these is probably ''The New Wittgenstein'' (op. cit.), and more recently ''Beyond the Tractatus Wars'' (ed. Rupert Read and Matthew Lavery, Routledge, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Conant has contributed to other areas in the history of analytic philosophy, writing particularly about the work of [[Gottlob Frege]], of [[Rudolf Carnap]], as well as about the relation between the views of both of these figures and those of Wittgenstein. A related theme running throughout Conant's work is the relation between the ideas of [[Immanuel Kant]], and the Kantian tradition more broadly, and the analytic tradition.&lt;ref name=analytickantianism&gt;See James Conant (ed.) ''Analytic Kantianism'', ''Philosophical Topics'', Vol. 34, Nos. 1 &amp; 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
Although his philosophical orientation is largely that of someone trained in the analytic tradition, Conant has also written a series of essays on various so-called “Continental" Philosophers, most notably on [[Kierkegaard]] and on [[Nietzsche]]. In his readings of specific texts by Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Wittgenstein, he explores the theme of how the literary form of a philosophical text is intertwined with its philosophical content.&lt;ref name=KierkegaardNietzsche&gt;See, for example, "Putting Two and Two Together: Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein and the Point of View for Their Work as Authors", in ''The Grammar of Religious Belief'', edited by D.Z. Phillips, St. Martins Press, NY: 1996; "Must We Show What We Cannot Say?" in ''The Senses of Stanley Cavell'', edited by R. Fleming and M. Payne, Bucknell University Press, 1989; "Nietzsche's Perfectionism: A Reading of Schopenhauer as Educator," in ''Nietzsche's Postmoralism'', edited by Richard Schacht, CUP, 2000; "The Dialectic of Perspectivism" in ''Sats - Nordic Journal of Philosophy'', Vol 6, No 2 (2005) and Vol 7, No 1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, Conant has written a number of essays exploring the treatment of philosophical ideas in literary texts, ranging from the short stories of [[Franz Kafka]] to the novels of [[George Orwell]].&lt;ref name=KafkaOrwell&gt;"In the Electoral Colony: Kafka in Florida," in ''Critical Inquiry'', Vol. 27, No. 4 (Summer, 2001), pp. 662-702; "Freedom, Cruelty and Truth: Rorty versus Orwell," in ''Richard Rorty and His Critics'', edited by Robert Brandom, Blackwell, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
A recurring topic throughout Conant’s work is that of philosophical [[skepticism]]. In this connection, he has drawn a distinction between two varieties of skepticism, which he calls “Cartesian skepticism” and “Kantian skepticism” respectively.&lt;ref name=varieties&gt;"Varieties of Skepticism," in ''Wittgenstein and Skepticism'', ed. by Denis McManus, (Routledge Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major research area of Conant’s is the history of analytic philosophy. In 2017, together with Jay Elliott, he brought out a comprehensive volume in the Norton Anthologies series, titled ''After Kant: The Analytic Tradition'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/914594581|title=The Norton anthology of western philosophy : after Kant|others=Schacht, Richard, 1941-, Rukgaber, Mathew,, Conant, James,, Elliott, Jay,|isbn=9780393929072|edition= First|location=New York|oclc=914594581}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering the entire range of the analytic tradition in philosophy from its beginnings to the present.

==Awards==
In 2016, Conant was one of three academics from abroad selected to receive Germany’s top international research award, the Alexander von Humboldt Professorship Research Prize.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2012 James Conant received the Humboldt Foundation Anneliese Maier Research Award, a five-year award to promote the internationalisation of the humanities and social sciences in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;
In summer 2011, the Institute of Philosophy of the University of Porto in Portugal hosted a conference titled ''The Logical Alien at 20'', dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the publication of James Conant's paper "The Search for Logically Alien Thought".

''' John Laird''' (17 May 1887 &amp;ndash; 5 August 1946) was a philosopher, in the school of [[Critical realism (philosophy of perception)|New British Realism]], who later turned to [[metaphysical idealism]].

John Laird was born at [[Durris]], [[Kincardineshire]], a parish adjacent to the birthplace of famous Scottish philosopher [[Thomas Reid]]. He was the son of Rev. D.M.W. Laird, a Church of Scotland minister, and Margaret Laird (née Steward).

He attended the grammar school of [[Aberdeen]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]], where in 1908 he graduated with a first class M.A. degree in philosophy.  He spent a brief interval at Heidelberg before entering Trinity College, Cambridge, as a Scholar. He graduated from Cambridge with a B.A.,1st class in both parts of the Moral Sciences tripos. (He received his Cambridge M.A. in 1920.) He was an Assistant Lecturer at the [[University of St. Andrews]] in 1911 and took up a Professorship of Philosophy at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1912. In the following year he returned to the United Kingdom as Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at Queen's University, Belfast (1913–24). In 1924 he was appointed as Regius Professor of Moral Philosophy at the [[University of Aberdeen]], a position which he held until his death. He was Mills Lecturer, [[University of California]], 1923-4 and Gifford Lecturer, Glasgow University, 1939-40.

In 1913 he met Helen Ritchie. They married in 1919 and had one son, who died in childhood. After the move to Aberdeen the Lairds
lived in Powis Lodge, Old Aberdeen.

Laird was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1929 to 1930. He was a prolific writer and public speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. DeLashmutt (University of Glasgow), "Gifford Lecture Series Author Biography: John Laird," available at: {{cite web|url=http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID%3D102 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505145123/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=102 |archivedate=2012-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Konstantin Sergeyevich Aksakov''' ({{lang-ru|Константи́н Серге́евич Акса́ков}}) (10 April 1817, [[Buguruslansky District|Novo-Aksakov]], [[Orenburg Governorate]] – 19 December 1860, [[Zakynthos]], [[United States of the Ionian Islands|US of the Ionian Islands]]) was a [[Russia]]n critic and writer, one of the earliest and most notable [[Slavophile]]s. He wrote plays, social criticism, and histories of the ancient Russian social order.&lt;ref name="Russell Bova"&gt;Russia and Western Civilization: Cultural and Historical Encounters By Russell Bova&lt;/ref&gt; His father [[Sergey Aksakov]] and his sister [[Vera Aksakova]] were writers,&lt;ref name="Ledkovskai͡a-AstmanRosenthal1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marina Ledkovskai͡a-Astman|author2=Charlotte Rosenthal|author3=Mary Fleming Zirin|title=Dictionary of Russian Women Writers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lI4hPO8u3ecC&amp;pg=PA613|year=1994|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-26265-4|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his younger brother, [[Ivan Aksakov]], was a journalist. 

Konstantin was the first to publish an analysis of [[Gogol]]'s ''[[Dead Souls]]'', comparing the Russian author with [[Homer]] (1842). After Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]'s accession to the throne, he sent him a letter advising to restore the [[zemsky sobor]] (1855). Aksakov also penned a number of articles on Slavonic [[linguistics]].

==Personal life==
Aksakov was born into a family of prominent Russian writer [[Sergei Aksakov|Sergey Timofeevich Aksakov]] (1791—1859) and his wife Olga Semyonovna Zaplatina (1793—1878). His paternal grandfather Timofey Stepanovich Aksakov belonged to an old [[Russian nobility|noble]] Aksakov family whose members claimed to be the decedents of [[Šimon]]. Their first documented ancestor was Ivan Feodorivich Velyaminov nicknamed Oksak who lived during the 15th century. His family crest was based on the Polish [[Przyjaciel coat of arms]] (also known as Aksak) which is considered to be of [[Tatar]] origin in Poland (the word «oksak» means «lame» in [[Turkic languages]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Andrei Kuleshov (2009)''. [http://aksakoff.ru/2010/01/chapter1/ Aksakovs. The History of Broken Fates. Chapter I: Origins]. — Moscow: Territory, 328 pages {{ISBN|978-5-98393-018-6}} at the official Aksakov family website (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; All this led some researches to believe that the Aksakov family also originated from Tatars,&lt;ref&gt;Peter K. Christoff, ''K.S. Aksakov, A Study in Ideas, Vol. III: An Introduction to Nineteenth-Century Russian Slavophilism'', [[Princeton University Press]] (2014), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; despite they had no relation to the Polish noble house. Aksakov's maternal grandfather was a Russian General Semyon Grigorievich Zaplatin who fought under the command of [[Alexander Suvorov]] and who married a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] captive Igel-Syum.&lt;ref&gt;''Kuleshov A. S., Naumov O. N. (2009)''. [http://aksakoff.ru/genealogy/gen25/ Aksakovs. Ahnentafel. Generation XXV]. — Moscow: Territory {{ISBN|978-5-98393-019-3}} at the official Aksakov family website (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aksakov was raised on a country estate before he moved to Moscow with his family. He remained with his parents his entire life, without ever marrying or moving out of the house.&lt;ref name="Russell Bova"/&gt; He studied at [[Moscow State University]], and he became a member of the Stankevitch Circle, a group of Russian [[Hegelianism|Hegelians]] and early believers of Russian democracy.

Aksakov eventually made the acquaintance of [[Ivan Kireyevsky]] and [[Aleksey Khomyakov]], adopted their philosophy of [[Slavophilism]] and broke off all contact with the Stankevitch Circle.

==Philosophy==
Aksakov's thesis on [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (1846) attempted to synthesize his view of the Russian peasant's religious and historical mission with Hegel's philosophy. Later in his career, Aksakov abandoned Hegelian philosophy and became radically anti-European.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1107277 Everything2.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Locke}}

The '''labor theory of property''' (also called the '''labor theory of appropriation''', '''labor theory of ownership''', '''labor theory of entitlement''', or '''principle of first appropriation''') is a theory of [[natural law]] that holds that property originally comes about by the exertion of labor upon natural resources. The theory has been used to justify the [[homestead principle]], which holds that one may gain whole permanent ownership of an unowned natural resource by performing an act of original appropriation.

In his ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise on Government]]'', the philosopher [[John Locke]] asked by what right an individual can claim to own one part of the world, when, according to the [[Bible]], God gave the world to all humanity in common. He answered that persons own themselves and therefore their own labor. When a person works, that labor enters into the object. Thus, the object becomes the property of that person.

However, Locke held that one may only appropriate property in this fashion if the [[Lockean proviso]] held true, that is, "... there is enough, and as good, left in common for others".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7370|title=Second Treatise of Government|last=Locke|first=John|publisher=|year=1690|isbn=|location=|pages=Sect. 27|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusive ownership and creation==
Locke argued in support of [[private property|individual property]] rights as [[natural rights]]. Following the argument the fruits of one's labor are one's own because one worked for it. Furthermore, the laborer must also hold a natural property right in the resource itself because — as Locke believes — exclusive ownership was immediately necessary for production.

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] later criticized this second step in [[Discourse on Inequality]], where he effectively argues that the natural right argument does not extend to resources that one did not create. Both philosophers hold that the relation between labor and ownership pertains only to property that was unowned before such labor took place.

==Enclosure vs mixing labor==
Land in its original state would be considered unowned by anyone, but if an individual applied his labor to the land by farming it, for example, it becomes his property. Merely placing a fence around land rather than using the land enclosed would not bring property into being according to most natural law theorists.

For example, economist [[Murray Rothbard]] stated (in ''[[Man, Economy, and State]]''):
{{quote|If Columbus lands on a new continent, is it legitimate for him to proclaim all the new continent his own, or even that sector 'as far as his eye can see'? Clearly, this would not be the case in the free society that we are postulating. Columbus or Crusoe would have to use the land, to 'cultivate' it in some way, before he could be asserted to own it.... If there is more land than can be used by a limited labor supply, then the unused land must simply remain unowned until a first user arrives on the scene. Any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be.}}

==Acquisition vs mixing labor==
The labor theory of property does not only apply to land itself, but to any application of labor to nature. For example, natural-rightist [[Lysander Spooner]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy|McElroy, Wendy]] (2006). [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/mcelroy/mcelroy107.html ''Lysander Spooner''], [[LewRockwell.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; says that an apple taken from an unowned tree would become the property of the person who plucked it, as he has labored to acquire it. He says the "only way, in which ["the wealth of nature"] can be made useful to mankind, is by their taking possession of it individually, and thus making it private property."&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander, [http://www.lysanderspooner.org/bib_new.htm "Law of Intellectual Property", How is the Right of Property acquired?.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718055020/http://www.lysanderspooner.org/bib_new.htm |date=2009-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]] have not seen this as creating property in all things. Tucker argued that "in the case of land, or of any other material the supply of which is so limited that all cannot hold it in unlimited quantities," these should only be considered owned while the individual is in the act of using or occupying these things.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin, [http://fair-use.org/benjamin-tucker/instead-of-a-book/more-questions#art14n1 "Instead of a Book", page 61, footnote.]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a rejection of [[Absentee ownership]] for land.

Locke held that individuals have a exclusive right to homestead private property from nature by working on it, but that they can do so only "...at least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others".&lt;ref&gt;Second Treatise of Government, Chapter V, paragraph 33&lt;/ref&gt; The proviso maintains that appropriation of unowned resources is a diminution of the rights of others to it, and would be acceptable only so long as it does not make anyone worse off than they would have been before. The phrase "Lockean Proviso" was coined by political philosopher Robert Nozick, and is based on the ideas elaborated by John Locke in his Second Treatise of Government.

==Criticism==
Aside from critiques of natural rights as a whole, Locke's labor theory of property has been singled out for critique by modern academics who doubt the idea that mixing something owned with something unowned could imbue the object with ownership:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite SEP |url-id=libertarianism|title=Libertarianism|first=Bas|last=van der Vossen|date=Sep 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mancilla |first1=Alejandra |title=A Can of Tomato Juice in the Sea {{!}} Issue 107 {{!}} Philosophy Now |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/107/A_Can_of_Tomato_Juice_in_the_Sea |website=philosophynow.org |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=[W]hy isn't mixing what I own with what I don't own a way of losing what I own rather than a way of gaining what I don't? If I own a can of tomato juice and spill it in the sea so that its molecules (made radioactive, so I can check this) mingle evenly throughout the sea, do I thereby come to own the sea, or have I foolishly dissipated my tomato juice?|author=[[Robert Nozick]]|source=[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]}}

[[Jeremy Waldron]] believes that Locke has made a [[category mistake]], as only objects can be mixed with other objects and laboring is not an object, but an activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mossoff |first1=Adam |title=Locke's Labor Lost |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2003 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.446780 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.446780 |language=en |issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Waldron |first1=Jeremy |title=Two Worries About Mixing One's Labour |journal=The Philosophical Quarterly (1950-) |date=1983 |volume=33 |issue=130 |pages=37–44 |doi=10.2307/2219202 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2219202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judith Jarvis Thomson]] points out that the act of laboring makes Locke's argument either an appeal to [[Desert_(philosophy)|desert]], in which case the reward is arbitrary ''"Why not instead a medal and a handshake from the president?"'', or little different than first possession theories that existed before Locke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite SEP |url-id=libertarianism|title=Libertarianism|first=Bas|last=van der Vossen|date=Sep 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fairfield |first1=Paul |title=Public/private |date=2005 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |isbn=978-0742549586 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomson |first1=Judith |title=The realm of rights |date=1992 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674749498 |page=325-330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental criticism of Locke's labor theory of property is that it, in practice, values a particular type of labor and land use (i.e.: agriculture) over all others. It thus does not recognise usage of land, for example, by hunter-gatherer societies as granting rights to ownership. In essence, the Lockean proviso depends on "the existence of a frontier, beyond which lies boundless usable land. This in turn requires the erasure (mentally and usually in brutal reality) of the people already living beyond the frontier and drawing their sustenance from the land in question." Locke's theories of property rights are often interpreted in the context of his support for chattel slavery of "prisoners captured in war" as a philosophical justification for the enslavement and genocides committed by early American colonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/06/locke-treatise-slavery-private-property/ |title=John Locke Against Freedom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9964">In [[Catholic moral theology]], the '''law of graduality''',  the '''law of gradualness''' or '''gradualism''', is the notion that people improve their relationship with God and grow in the virtues gradually, and do not jump to perfection in a single step.&lt;ref name=akin/&gt;&lt;ref name=twist/&gt;&lt;ref name=confused/&gt;  In terms of [[pastoral care]], it suggests that "it is often better to encourage the positive elements in someone's life rather than to chastise their flaws".&lt;ref name=twist/&gt;&lt;ref name=vademecum/&gt;  It is "as old as Christianity itself",&lt;ref name=confused/&gt; being referred to in several [[New Testament]] passages.&lt;ref name=akin/&gt;

It is distinct from "gradualness of the law",&lt;ref name=Familiaris/&gt; an idea that would tend to diminish the demands of the law.&lt;ref name=vademecum/&gt; It does not mean "that we compromise on the content of the law" but that we recognize our failings and strive to correspond to its demands over time.&lt;ref name=confused/&gt;

==Gradations of evil==
The law of graduality recognizes that the lives and relationships of people with morally unacceptable lifestyles may have some elements of good, even of great good, such as sacrificial love and consistent respect. It recognizes that virtues are not all-or-nothing propositions, and that elements of good may be found even in the context of morally unacceptable situations.&lt;ref name=twist/&gt;

Gradualism recognizes elements of good in what on the whole is blameworthy, so as to encourage steps towards greater perfection, instead of simply chastising people for their mistakes.&lt;ref name=twist/&gt;  In this sense, gradualism is recognition that even in matters of grave evil there can be gradations of objective depravity, although the grave evil does not cease to be a grave evil.&lt;ref name=Fessio/&gt;

==Growth towards goodness==
In a Christian sense, conversion does not happen once and is over.  It is "a fundamental change in one's direction — a new path or way of life in which one must learn to walk."&lt;ref name=process/&gt;  In his [[apostolic exhortation]] ''Familiaris consortio'' of 1981, [[Pope John Paul II]] declared: "What is needed is a continuous, permanent conversion" that "is brought about concretely in steps which lead us ever forward. Thus a dynamic process develops, one which advances gradually."&lt;ref name=Familiaris/&gt;  He added that man "day by day builds himself up through his many free decisions; and so he knows, loves and accomplishes moral good by stages of growth.”&lt;ref name=Familiaris/&gt;

In effect, he said that the Christian life can always be attained through God's grace, and our striving for it becomes easier according as we put it into practice. What Pope John Paul called the law of gradualness in human behavior is the step-by-step perfecting of the person in that person's practice of the Christian life.&lt;ref name=Marriage/&gt;

Writing on ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' about the 1986 letter of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] on [[Homosexualitatis problema|the pastoral care of homosexual persons]], Bartholomew Kiely stated: "The 'law of gradualness' implies that when there exists a genuine (unfeigned) weakness in following a moral norm, the person is obliged to 'endeavour to place [or establish] the conditions for its observance' (''Familiaris consortio'', 34, par. 4). In other words, a person must be protected from discouragement even if the journey towards a life of Christian chastity involves special difficulties and is accompanied by repeated failures."&lt;ref name=Psychological/&gt;

==Gradualness of the law==
Much more controversial has been the use that some theologians have made of the concept as grounds for a permissive attitude to moral norms, treating them merely as ideals.&lt;ref name=akin/&gt;&lt;ref name=twist/&gt; Some have invoked this understanding on matters such as the Catholic Church's ban on artificial contraception,&lt;ref name=akin/&gt;&lt;ref name=twist/&gt; or cohabitating couples.&lt;ref name=process/&gt; This "lower[ing] the bar" of Church teachings that are deemed to be too difficult&lt;ref name=process/&gt; has been denigrated as [[moral relativism]].&lt;ref name=twist/&gt;  Some believed this interpretation seemed to be mentioned in an interim discussion document presented at the [[Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops]] in October 2014,&lt;ref name=akin/&gt; but it was excluded from the Synod's final report.&lt;ref name="process"/&gt;

Pope John Paul II cautioned that "what is known as 'the law of gradualness' cannot be identified with 'gradualness of the law'".&lt;ref name=Familiaris/&gt; And in guidelines for [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confessors]] in 1997, the [[Pontifical Council for the Family]] stated that they should not be led by the law of gradualness to give people the impression that repentance does not require a decisive break with sin.&lt;ref name=akin/&gt;&lt;ref name=vademecum/&gt;

While the Catholic Church opposes the use of artificial contraceptives, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] said that, when a prostitute uses a condom to help stop the spread of AIDS, it could be "a first step in a movement toward a different way, a more human way, of living sexuality."&lt;ref name=condoms/&gt;  This could be, the pope said, "a first assumption of responsibility, on the way toward recovering an awareness that not everything is allowed and that one cannot do whatever one wants."&lt;ref name=condoms/&gt;  The concern for others thus suggested is laudable, but it does not mean that either prostitution or condoms are in themselves good.&lt;ref name=twist/&gt;&lt;ref name=process/&gt;&lt;ref name=condoms/&gt;

In the concept of "the law of gradualness", Bartholomew Kiely wrote, those who are genuinely unable to observe the norm are nonetheless obliged to try, as Pope Paul said, "to place the conditions for its observance". They are always free to attempt, even if they lack the freedom to succeed. On the contrary, in the concept of "gradualness of the law", they would be under no obligation even to make an attempt.&lt;ref name=Impracticality/&gt;

What Pope John Paul said is that the moral teachings are always binding (no "gradualness of the law"), and practice makes them easier to observe ("the law of gradualness").&lt;ref name=Marriage/&gt;

[[File:Matrimandir1.JPG|300px|thumb|right|Matrimandir and the banyan tree, the centre of [[Auroville]]]]

The '''Matrimandir''' (Sanskrit for ''Temple of The Mother'') is an edifice of spiritual significance for practitioners of [[Integral yoga]], situated at the centre of [[Auroville]]  initiated by [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]] of the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]]. It is called ''soul of the city'' and is situated in a large open space called ''Peace''. Matrimandir does not belong to any particular religion or sect.

==Structure and surroundings==
{{Sri Aurobindo}}

The Matrimandir took 37 years to build, from the laying of the foundation stone at sunrise on 21 February 1971 - the Mother’s 93rd birthday - to its completion in May 2008. It is in the form of a huge sphere surrounded by twelve petals. The [[Geodesic dome]] is covered by golden discs and reflects sunlight, which gives the structure its characteristic radiance. Inside this central dome is a meditation hall known as the ''inner chamber'' - this contains the largest optically-perfect glass globe in the world. The Matrimandir, and its surrounding gardens in the central Peace Area, is open to the public by appointment.

The four main pillars that support the structure of Matrimandir, and carry the Inner Chamber, have been set at the four main directions of the compass. These four pillars are symbolic of the four aspects of the mother as described by [[Sri Aurobindo]], and are named after these four aspects.

==Controversies==

'''Matthew of Aquasparta''' (Matteo di Aquasparta, 1240 – 29 October 1302) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Franciscans|Friar Minor]] and [[scholastic philosopher]]. He was elected [[Minister General]] of the Order.

==Life==
Born in [[Acquasparta]], [[Umbria]], he was a member of the [[Bentivenghi]] family, to which belonged his fellow Franciscan, Cardinal [[Bentivenga de' Bentivenghi]], bishop of Albano (died 1290). Matthew entered the Franciscan Order at [[Todi]], took the degree of Master of Theology at Paris, and taught also for a time at Bologna.

Friar [[John Peckham]] having become [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1279, Matteo was in 1280 made Peckham's successor as ''Lector sacri Palatii apostolici'', i.e. he was appointed reader (teacher) of theology to the [[papal Curia]]. In 1287 the [[General Chapter]] of the Order held at [[Montpellier]] elected him Minister General in succession to [[Arlotto of Prato]].

When [[Girolamo Masci]] of Ascoli, who had previously been Minister General of the Franciscan Order, became pope as Nicholas IV, 15 February 1288, he created Matthew cardinal with the ''[[Titular church|titulus]]'' of [[San Lorenzo in Damaso]] that May. After this Matteo was made [[Cardinal Bishop of Porto]], and ''[[penitentiarius major]]'' (Grand Penitentiary). He still, however, retained the direction of the Order until the chapter of 1289. Matthew had summoned this chapter to meet at [[Assisi]], but Nicholas IV caused it to be held in his presence at [[Rieti]]; here [[Raymond Gaufredi]], a native of Provence, was elected Minister General.

As Minister General of the Order, Matthew maintained a moderate, middle course; among other things he reorganized the studies pursued in the order. In the quarrel between [[Pope Boniface VIII]] and the [[Colonna]] family, from 1297 onwards, he strongly supported the pope, both in official memorials and in public sermons. Pope Boniface  appointed him, both in 1297 and 1300, to important embassies to Lombardy, the Romagna, and to [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] Florence, where the  Neri and Bianchi Guelph factions were violently at issue with each other.

In 1301 Matthew returned to Florence, following [[Charles of Valois]], but neither peace nor reconciliation was brought about. The Blacks finally obtained the upper hand, and the chief Whites were obliged to go into exile; among these was the poet [[Dante]]. In a famous passage of the ''Divina Commedia'' (Paradiso, XII, 124-26), Dante certainly speaks as a partisan of the Bianchi against Matthew of Aquasparta, calling Cardinal Matthew a [[Sodomy|sodomite]]. Matthew, however, had died before this, on 28 October, 1302. He was buried in Rome, in the Franciscan church of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli]], where his monument is still to be seen.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo Cardella, ''Memorie de' Cardinali della Santa Romana Chiesa'' (Rome 1793), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Matteo was a learned philosopher and theologian and a personal pupil of St. [[Bonaventure]], whose teaching, in general, he followed, or rather developed. In this respect he was one of what is known as the older Franciscan school, who preferred [[Augustinianism]] to the more pronounced [[Aristoteleanism]] of [[Thomas Aquinas]].

His principal work is the acute ''Quæstiones disputatæ'', which treats of various subjects. Of this one book appeared at [[Quaracchi]] in 1903, namely: "Quæstiones disputatæ selectæ", in "Bibliotheca Franciscana scholastica medii ævi", I; the "Quæstiones" are preceded by a "Tractatus de excellentia S. Scripturæ" (pp.&amp;nbsp;1–22), also by a "Sermo de studio S. Scripturæ" (pp.&amp;nbsp;22–36); it is followed by "De processione Spiritus Sancti" (pp.&amp;nbsp;429–53). Five "Quæstiones de Cognitione" had already been edited in the collection called "De humanæ cognitionis ratione anecdota quædam" (Quaracchi, 1883), 87-182.

The rest of his works, still unedited, are to be found at Assisi and Todi. Among them are: "Commentarius in 4 libros Sententiarum" (autograph); "Concordantiæ super 4 ll. Sententiarum"; "Postilla super librum Job"; "Postilla super Psalterium" (autograph); "In 12 Prophetas Minores"; "In Danielem"; "In Ev. Matthæi"; "In Apocalypsim" (autograph); "In Epist. ad Romanos"; "Sermones dominicales et feriales" (autograph).

{{refimprove|date=October 2015}}

In [[philosophy of mind]], '''mentalism''' is the view that the [[mind]] and mental states exist as causally efficacious inner states of persons. The view should be distinguished from [[substance dualism]], which is the view that the mind and the body (or brain) are two distinct kinds of things which nevertheless interact with one another. Although this dualistic view of the mind–body connection [[Logical consequence|entails]] mentalism, mentalism does not entail dualism. [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] have been two of mentalism's most ardent recent defenders.

In [[linguistics]], mentalism represents rationalistic philosophy (as opposed to behaviouristic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornbury|first1=Scott|title=An A-Z of ELT (Methodology)|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan Education|location=Oxford|isbn=1405070633|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nguyễn Trãi''' (阮廌), [[pen name]] '''Ức Trai''' (抑齋); (1380–1442) was an illustrious Vietnamese [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[Scholarly method|scholar]], a noted [[poet]],&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Pelley ''Postcolonial Vietnam: New Histories of the National Past'' 2002 - Page 125 "One of the most celebrated poets was Nguyễn Trãi, whose famous victory poem, poems addressed to military personnel, poems in classical Chinese, and, most critically, his poems in Nom were granted a place of special honor in the literary canon."&lt;/ref&gt; a skilled [[politician]] and a master [[strategist]]. He was at times attributed with being capable of almost miraculous or mythical deeds in his designated capacity as a close friend and principal advisor of [[Lê Lợi]], Vietnam's hero-emperor, who fought to free the country from [[China|Chinese]] rule. He is credited with writing the important political statements of Lê Lợi and inspiring the Vietnamese populace to support open rebellion against the [[Ming Dynasty]] rulers. He is also the author of "Great Proclamation upon the Pacification of the Wu" ([[Bình Ngô đại cáo]]).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Nguyễn Trãi originally was from [[Hải Dương Province]], he was born in 1380 in Thăng Long (present day [[Hanoi]]), the capital of the declining [[Trần Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;''Renowned Vietnamese Intellectuals'', p.48 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the brief [[Hồ Dynasty]], he passed examination and served for a time in the government.  In 1406, [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] force invaded and conquered Vietnam.  Under the occupation, the Ming China attempted to convert Vietnam into a Chinese province and ruthlessly quashed all rebellions.

===War of independence===
[[File:National Museum Vietnamese History 65.jpg|thumb|Vĩnh Lăng stele (replica). Stone, erected in the 6th year of [[Lê Lợi|Thuận Thiên]] reign (1433). Early Lê dynasty, ancient capital of [[Lam Kinh]], [[Thanh Hóa Province]], central Vietnam. Inscribed by Nguyễn Trãi. Commemorative element. Inscription showed on biography of [[Lê Lợi]], leader of Lam Son uprising (1418-1427) against Ming invaders from China, from beginning to final victory and him becoming the first emperor of the Early Lê dynasty in 1428. This stele is also one of typical stone sculptures of Vietnam fine art in the 15th century. [[National Museum of Vietnamese History]], Hanoi.]]

In 1417, Nguyễn Trãi joined a rebel leader named Lê Lợi, who was [[Lam Sơn uprising|resisting the occupation]] from a mountainous region in [[Thanh Hóa Province]] south of Hanoi.  Nguyễn Trãi served as the chief advisor, strategist and propagandist for the movement.

The war of independence leading to the defeat of the Ming and the inauguration of the [[Lê Dynasty]] lasted from 1417 to 1427.&lt;ref&gt;''Renowned Vietnamese Intellectuals'', p.55 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1417 until 1423, Lê Lợi conducted a classic guerilla campaign from his bases in the mountains.  Following a negotiated truce, Lê Lợi, following the advice of Nguyễn Chích, led his army to the southern prefecture of [[Nghệ An]]. From Nghệ An, Vietnamese forces won many battles and gained control over the whole part of Vietnam from [[Thanh Hóa]] southwards. The Ming sent a series of military reinforcements in response to bolster their positions.  In 1426, the army of a [[China|Chinese]] general named [[Wang Tong (Ming Dynasty)|Wang Tong]] arrived in the [[Red River Delta]].  However, Vietnamese forces were able to [[Battle of Tot Dong|cut supply lines]] and control the countryside, leaving Chinese presence totally isolated in the capital and other citadels.  During this period, Nguyễn Trãi sought to undermine the resolve of the enemy and to negotiate a favorable peace by sending a series of missives to the Ming commanders.&lt;ref&gt;An English translation of one such letter, under the title "New Letter to Wang Tong", has been published in ''Renowned Vietnamese Intellectuals'', p.69 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1427 the Ming emperor [[Xuande Emperor|Xuande]] sent two large reinforcing armies to Vietnam. Lê Lợi moved his forces to the frontier, where they confronted and utterly defeated Chinese reinforcements in a series of bloody battles, most notably the battle of Chi Lăng-Xương Giang. Wang Tong sued for peace.  The numerous Chinese prisoners of war were all given provisions and allowed to return to China.  Nguyễn Trãi penned a famous proclamation of victory.&lt;ref&gt;An English translation of the proclamation, under the title "Proclamation of Victory over the Wu", has been published in ''Renowned Vietnamese Intellectuals'', pp.63 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
After the war Nguyễn Trãi was elevated by Lê Lợi to an exalted position in the new court but internal intrigues, sycophantic machinations and clannish nepotism meant he was not appointed regent upon the emperor's death. Instead that position was bestowed upon [[Lê Sát]], who ruled as regent on behalf of the young heir [[Lê Thái Tông]].{{fact|date=January 2018}}

At some point during the regency of Lê Sát, having found life at court increasingly difficult, Nguyễn Trãi retired to his country home north of [[Hanoi]] in the tranquil mountains of [[Chí Linh]], where he enjoyed poetry writing and [[meditation]]. Today, visitors can visit this site where a large [[shrine]] of remembrance, covering from the foot of the mountain to the top is erected to honour the national hero. The site of Nguyễn Trãi's house still exists, however only the tiled floors remain original. Close by is an ancient Buddhist temple, which has stood there several centuries before his time.

==Death==
{{Main article|Mystery of Lệ Chi Viên}}
Nguyễn Trãi's  death resulted from a scandal involving the young emperor, Lê Thái Tông, and the wife or concubine of Nguyễn Trãi, named Nguyễn Thị Lộ. Early in 1442, the young emperor began an affair with Nguyễn Thị Lộ. This affair continued when the emperor visited the old scholar at his home. Not long after having left, Lê Thái Tông suddenly became ill and died. The nobles at the court blamed Nguyễn Trãi and Nguyễn Thị Lộ for the young emperor's death, accused them of regicide and had both, [[Nine exterminations|along with most members of their extended families, executed]].

Twenty years later, Lê Thái Tông's son, emperor [[Lê Thánh Tông]] officially pardoned Nguyễn Trãi, saying that he was wholly innocent in the death of Thánh Tông's father.

==Legacy==
[[File:Nguyen Trai Quebec.JPG|thumb|Nguyễn Trãi, monument in [[Quebec City]]]]
According to Loren Baritz ("Backfire: A History of How American Culture Led Us Into Vietnam and Made Us Fight the Way We Did", 1985), Trai set down the Vietnamese strategy against the Chinese in an essay.  This essay would prove to be very close to the Communists' strategy of insurgency.  Specifically you must, "subordinate military action to the political and moral struggle...better to conquer hearts than citadels."

Most cities in Vietnam have named major streets after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Vietnam Country Map |publisher=Periplus Travel Maps |year=2002&amp;ndash;03 |isbn=0-7946-0070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Nguyễn Trãi had 5 wives (or concubines) and 7 sons. 

'''Wive/Concubines:''' &lt;br /&gt;

• Lady Phạm Đỗ Minh Hiển&lt;br /&gt;

• Lady Phùng Thị&lt;br /&gt;

• Lady Nguyễn Thị Lộ&lt;br /&gt;

• Lady Phạm Thị Mẫn &lt;br /&gt;

• Lady Trần Anh Minh

'''Sons:'''&lt;br /&gt;

• Nguyễn Khuê (Lady Trần's)&lt;br /&gt;

• Nguyễn Ứng (Lady Trần's)&lt;br /&gt;

• Nguyễn Phù (Lady Trần's)&lt;br /&gt;

• Nguyễn Bảng (Lady Phùng's)&lt;br /&gt;

• Nguyễn Tích (Lady Phùng's)&lt;br /&gt;

• Nguyễn Anh Vũ (Lady Phạm's)&lt;br /&gt;

• Forefather of a Nguyễn family's branch in Quế Lĩnh, Phương Quất, Kinh Môn District, Hải Dương Province. (Lady Lê's)

== Work ==
Being both a military tactician and a poet, Nguyễn Trãi's works varied in many areas ranging from literature, history, geography, ceremony and propriety; many of them were missing after his execution. Most of his poems that survive until today were collected in ''Ức Trai Thi Tập'' (Ức Trai's Poems Collection) by Dương Bá Cung, printed in 1868 under Nguyễn Dynasty. His poems, written in both ancient Chinese (Hán) and Vietnamese (Nôm), were highly regarded by notable philosophers, poets, and politicians{{who|date=April 2016}} in Vietnamese history. 

In 2010, Vietnamese poet [[Nguyễn Đỗ]] and American poet [[Paul Hoover]] published the first collection of Nguyễn Trãi's poetry in English translation, titled ''Beyond the Court Gate: Selected Poems''. The collection reflects Nguyễn Trãi's metaphysical contemplation of tiny details in everyday life,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} but at the same time set him apart from [[Li Po]]'s uses of extreme imaginary{{huh|date=July 2017}} and formal poetic rules.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Nguyễn Trãi's poems demonstrate wit, humility, and a conversational tone, and express his personal perception and experience.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} 

An example of Nguyễn Trãi's writing is his poem ''To a Friend'' (Traditional Chinese: 記友, Sino-Vietnamese: ''Kí Hữu'', Vietnamese: ''Gửi Bạn''), as translated and edited by Nguyễn Đỗ and Paul Hoover: 

&lt;br /&gt;
'''記友'''
&lt;br /&gt;
半生世路嘆屯邅， 
&lt;br /&gt;
萬事惟應付老天。 
&lt;br /&gt;
寸舌但存空自信， 
&lt;br /&gt;
一寒如故亦堪憐。 
&lt;br /&gt;
光陰焂忽時難再， 
&lt;br /&gt;
客舍凄涼夜似年。 
&lt;br /&gt;
十載讀書貧到骨， 
&lt;br /&gt;
盤惟苜蓿坐無氈。

&lt;br /&gt;
'''''To a Friend'''''
''&lt;br /&gt;
''My fate naturally has many twists and sharp turns,''
&lt;br /&gt;
''So in everything I trust in the wisdom of Heaven.''
&lt;br /&gt;
''I still have my tongue—believe me, I am able to talk,''
&lt;br /&gt;
''Even though I’m still poor and, as we know, pathetic.''
&lt;br /&gt;
''Never to return, the past flies too quickly and the time is short,''
&lt;br /&gt;
''But, wandering in this cold room, the night is far too long.''
&lt;br /&gt;
''I’ve been reading books for ten years, but I’m poor from clothes to bone''
&lt;br /&gt;
''From eating only vegetables and sitting without a cushion.''

'''On Social Freedom: or the Necessary Limits of Individual Freedom Arising Out of the Conditions of Our Social Life''' is an essay regarding individual and societal freedom initially thought to have been written by the British philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]],&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Oswald. "On Social Freedom." In Oxford and Cambridge Review (London: Archibald Constable &amp; Co. Ltd., 1907) pp. 57-83.&lt;/ref&gt; but later found to have been falsely attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, J.C. ''Mill and His Early Critics'' (Leicester: University College, 1956), pp. 38-54&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovered in 1907 among the possessions left in the home at which Mill died in [[Avignon, France]], it was published in June 1907 as a special article in [[The Oxford and Cambridge Review]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford and Cambridge Review on Google Books, "John Stuart Mill: On Social Freedom: or the Necessary Limits of Individual Freedom Arising Out of the Conditions of Our Social Life", June 1907&lt;/ref&gt;  The work was republished by Columbia University Press in 1941, but failed to attract much attention. In 1955, the Liberal Arts Press intended to republish it in a volume also containing ''[[On Liberty]]'', but decided against doing so in view of the doubts surrounding its authorship raised by the Mill scholar J.C. Rees. He then set out the full case against attributing the work to Mill in his 1956 work ''Mill and His Early Critics''.

Rees's explanation for how the manuscript ended up among Mill's possessions is summarised by J.P. Scanlan:&lt;ref&gt;Scanlan, J.P. "J.S. Mill and the Definition of Freedom", Ethics, Vol. 68, No. 3 (University of Chicago Press, April 1958), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In September, 1862, Mill wrote a letter from Avignon to a certain E.R. Edger, acknowledging receipt of a manuscript entitled "Social Freedom." Apparently Edger hoped to elicit from Mill an appraisal of his capacity for philosophical inquiry, and had sent the manuscript as a sample of his work. Mill replies politely and with his usual care that he finds many signs of competence in the work - mostly, however, in the form of "promise rather than performance" - and he exhorts Edger to continue thinking and writing, though not "to the neglect of other modes of gaining a subsistence." Concerining Edger's views Mill says only that, if he were to comment in detail, he "should have much to say against several of your positions, and especially against your definition of liberty."&lt;ref&gt;The Letters of John Stuart Mill, ed. Hugh S.R. Elliot (London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1910), Volume 1, pp. 259-61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The letter is included in Mill's ''Collected Works''&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Vol. XV: The Later Letters 1849-1873 Part II, (University of Toronto Press 1963), p. 792&lt;/ref&gt; where Edger is identified as "probably Ebenezer R. Edger, associate of [[George Holyoake|G.J. Holyoake]] in the promoting of the [[history of the cooperative movement|co-operative movement]], writer for ''The Secular World'' and author of tracts on co-operation." Holyoake briefly mentions Edger in ''The History of Co-operation'':&lt;ref&gt;Holyoake, George Jacob, The History of Co-operation (T. Fisher Unwin, 1906 [Vol. 1: 1875, Vol. 2: 1879])&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ten years later my colleague, Mr E. R. Edger, visited Mr. Crisell, the manager of the farm whom the Rev. Mr. Robinson had found to be "manly, open, and ingenious appearance," beyond what he expected of one belonging to the "depressed" class. Mr. Edger sent me this report:-

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I paid a visit to Assington, and had a conversation with the manager, Mr. Crisell (pronounced with i long, 'Cry-sell').  I can feel no enthusiasm at all about the Assington Farm.  There seems no 'co-operation' in the right sense of the term, but only ''bounty'' of the squire towards poor neighbours.

(1) It is limited to inhabitants of the parish.
(2) Each member can hold only one share.
(3) Members have no voice in the management.
(4) Wages to workmen same as usual.
(5) No special inducement offered to the workmen to become shareholders.  The manager remarked that they did not care particularly to employ the members; this seems to me very significant.
It has been in existence forty-one years, so it will take a long time to renovate society that way.  Remember, I only give my impressions."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An E.R. Edger is also listed in The British Medical Journal on the 24th of April 1869 as having passed a primary examination in anatomy and physiology at the Royal College of Surgeons of England.&lt;ref&gt;The British Medical Journal, April 24, 1869, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pascal Etcheber''' (born August 2, 1963) is a [[France|French]] [[author]] and [[philosopher]].  He co-edited “Managing Sensitive Projects” published by Macmillan in the UK and Routledge in the US in 1998.
In "The Strength of Becoming: a philosophical treatise on the new art &amp; science of living", Pascal Etcheber argues that there is a positive outlook in [[Existentialism]] through creating. Since only individuals can bring meaning into the world “Creativism” allows individuals to both find themselves and fulfillment.
His Philosophy is further outlined in “Vagabond Earth” (published by Substance Publishing in 2004). He purports that [[Human beings]] are driven by three essential needs: [[Freedom (philosophy)|Freedom]], Actions and [[Ethics]], that the [[world]] is organized with [[Religions]], [[Economics]] and [[Politics]] to apparently fulfill those needs. However, human beings can never find fulfillment because Freedom is lost by the obedience to [[laws]]; Actions are made useless by the belief that this world is meaningless compared to a higher, [[Spirit|spiritual world]] or [[afterlife]]; [[Ethics]] is never attained because participation in [[economics]] does not lead into abundance for all but the success of a few to the detriment of the majority. “Vagabond Earth” proposes a blue print for a moneyless society of one world with no [[governments]] with people actively engaged in making this world a good place to live. In 2012, "7 principles for an Economic Revolution" marks a less utopian outlook and proposes new hopes for full employment and higher standards of living, even in mature economies, despite globalization.

The [[British Philosophical Association]] listed Pascal Etcheber in their success stories as one of 38 people who graduated in [[Philosophy]] and achieved success in their subsequent careers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpa.ac.uk/resources/careers-and-success-stories Success stories]
&lt;/ref&gt;
He graduated in [[Philosophy]] with a Dean's commendation from [[Exeter University]] in the [[UK]]. He also holds a diploma in [[English Literature]] from [[Exeter University]].

Pascal Etcheber is a Management consultant who has worked in 18 countries. He has been an active speaker notably in the nuclear world to encourage the successful development of difficult projects that are necessary. In 1999, he spoke at the [[Uranium Institute]] on “Unlocking local knowledge to benefit public acceptance work”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/sym/1999/etchbio.htm World Nuclear Symposium 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he spoke at the [[World Nuclear Association]] on “Controversial projects can succeed in today’s world…even from the brink of defeat”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-nuclear.org/sym/2003/etcheber.htm[World Nuclear Symposium 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Pascal Etcheber wrote “Freeing the Organization”,a business book that exposes the myths of management consultants, uncovers the root causes of the inefficiencies crippling large organizations and explains how to overcome these issues quickly without large teams of consultants settling in.
Pascal Etcheber, a member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]] in [[France]] and in the [[UK]], described a simplified method for calculating any day of the [[Gregorian calendar]] explained in [[Determination of the day of the week]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://calculatingday.blogspot.fr/p/easy-method-for-calculating-dates-day.html Easy method for mentally calculating a date's day of the week in seconds]
&lt;/ref&gt; and made available for free on [[scribd]] a knowledge acquisition method that is both fast, fun and effective in the practical guide entitled " The Hard Way or the Easy Way? Fast Fun Learning" &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/112781749/The-Hard-Way-or-the-Easy-Way-A-Practical-Guide-to-Fast-Fun-Learning]
&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2009, Pascal Etcheber was charged with making a false statement to the FBI 18 months earlier. [[The Post and Courier]] reported the case on the front page over the 15 months court case. Officially, Pascal Etcheber was prosecuted for his link to [[Thomas Ravenel]]. Unofficially, Pascal Etcheber was being investigated for being an agent of the [[French Secret Service]]. Eventually, all charges against Pascal Etcheber were dismissed and he pleaded guilty to the fact that a chef who was cooking for a party of 12 people in his house smoked a joint in the kitchen without his consent in the summer of 2004. After passing a [[polygraph test]] with the [[FBI]], the prosecutor recognized in court that all National security issues regarding Pascal Etcheber had been cleared.

'''Reasonism''' (similar to [[rationalism]]) is an [[epistemology|epistemological]] [[theory]] that holds that reliance on [[reason]] is the best guide for [[belief]] and [[Action (philosophy)|action]]. [[Philosophy|Philosophically]], it is the theory that the exercise of reason, rather than [[experience]], [[authority]], or [[spiritual revelation]], provides the primary basis for [[knowledge]].

The term reasonist is used interchangeably with rationalist, both terms being used to distinguish them as true reasoners and rational inquirers.

A number of writers and thinkers have used the terms reasonist or reasonism to identify themselves or their philosophy respectively, often preferentially to the labels such as atheist or atheism. During the Beyond Belief Symposium (Enlightenment 2.0) in October 2007, UCLA historian Robert Winter explains to speaker Sam Harris that he refers to themselves (non-believers) as "reasonists", and others (religionists) as "areasonists", based on the historical fact that the prefix a- is always supplied by those who have the power within a given paradigm, to describe those who don't have that paradigm.

The '''right to protest''' is a human right arising out of a number of recognized [[human rights]]. While no human rights instrument or national constitution grants the absolute right to [[protest]], such a right to protest may be a manifestation of the right to [[freedom of assembly]], the right to [[freedom of association]], and the right to [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourrights.org.uk/your-rights/chapters/the-right-of-peaceful-protest/the-historic-right-of-peaceful-protest/the-historic-right-of-peaceful-protest.shtml|title=The Historic Right to Peaceful Protest|date=19 September 2006|publisher=YourRights.org.uk ([[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]])|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430160441/http://www.yourrights.org.uk/your-rights/chapters/the-right-of-peaceful-protest/the-historic-right-of-peaceful-protest/the-historic-right-of-peaceful-protest.shtml|archivedate=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;Additionally, protest and restrictions on protest have lasted as long as governments have.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183q56g|title="The Right to Peaceful Protest" in Your Rights: The Liberty Guide to Human Rights|last=Cooper|first=Jo|date=2005|publisher=Pluto Press|year=|isbn=9780745322766|editor-last=Addis|editor-first=Megan|edition=8|location=|pages=|editor-last2=Morrow|editor-first2=Penelope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many international treaties contain clear articulations of the right to protest and it is crucial for individuals who are interested in protesting to stay up to date and aware. Such agreements include the 1950 [[European Convention on Human Rights]], especially Articles 9 to 11; and the 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], especially Articles 18 to 22. Articles 9 enunciates the "right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms] and/or ''[https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]'' Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights&lt;/ref&gt; Article 10 enunciates the "right to freedom of expression."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Article 11 enunciates the "right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, in these and other agreements the rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of association, and freedom of speech are subject to certain limitations. For example, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] contains prohibitions on "[[propaganda]] of war" and advocacy of "national, racial or religious [[hatred]]"; and it allows the restriction of the freedom to assembly if it is necessary "in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others." (Articles 20 and 21)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is important for people interested in protest to note that different places have passed their own clarification of these rights.

Protesting, however, is not necessarily violent or a threat to the interests of national security or public safety. Nor is it necessarily [[civil disobedience]], because most protest does not involve violating the laws of the state. Also, since it is an expression of a universal right, choosing to lawfully protest is not a violation of state laws. Protests, even campaigns of [[nonviolent resistance]] or [[civil resistance]], can often have the character (in addition to using nonviolent methods) of positively supporting a democratic and constitutional order. This can happen, for example, when such resistance arises in response to a military [[coup d'état]];&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]], "Civil Resistance to Military Coups", ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'', Oslo, vol. 12, no. 1, 1975, pp. 19-36.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the somewhat similar case of a refusal of the state leadership to surrender office following defeat in an election. During points of widespread tension or controversy within a society, it is important for government institutions to recognize this right. A democracy's ability to preserve its citizen's right to protest is a result of that democracy's "political health."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''S. Barry Cooper''' (9 October 1943 – 26 October 2015) was a British mathematician and [[computability theory|computability theorist]]. He was a professor of [[Pure Mathematics]] at the [[University of Leeds]]. 

==Biography==
Cooper grew up in [[Bognor Regis]] and attended Chichester High School for Boys, during which time he played scrum-half for the under-15s England rugby team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-d0cc-World-leading-mathematician-and-activist-Barry-Cooper-dies Obituary by Peter Lazenby in the Morning Star]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper graduated from [[Jesus College, Oxford]] in 1966, and in 1970 received his PhD from [[University of Leicester]] under the supervision of [[Reuben Goodstein]] and C.E.M. Yates, with a thesis entitled ''Degrees of Unsolvability''. In the 1970s, he was also a leading figure in the Chile Solidarity Campaign, welcoming Chilean refugees to Leeds.

Cooper was appointed Lecturer in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds in 1969, where he remained for the rest of his career.  He was promoted to [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Mathematical Logic in 1991 and to Professor of Pure Mathematics in 1996. In 2011, he was awarded an honorary doctorate 
at the [[University of Sofia]] "St. Kliment Ohridski".

His book ''Computability Theory'' made the technical research area accessible to a new generation of students.  He was a leading mover of the return to basic questions of the kind considered by [[Alan Turing]], and of interdisciplinary developments related to computability. He was President of the Association [[Computability in Europe]], and Chair of the Turing Centenary Advisory Committee (TCAC) which 
co-ordinated the [[Alan Turing Year]]. The book ''Alan Turing: His Work and Impact'', edited by Cooper and [[Jan van Leeuwen]], won the [[Association of American Publishers]]' R. R. Hawkins Award.

He was a keen long-distance runner, and was also interested in jazz and improvised music, founding Leeds Jazz and being involved in the Termite Club. Cooper died on 26 October 2015 after a short illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/forstaff/news/article/4935/Professor_Barry_Cooper University of Leeds, obituary announcement, published 30 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper was a member of the [[editorial board]] for ''[[The Rutherford Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Editorial board | url=http://www.rutherfordjournal.org/editorial.html | work=[[The Rutherford Journal]] | accessdate=19 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scott Soames''' ({{IPAc-en|s|oʊ|m|s}}; born August 11, 1946) is an American philosopher. He is a professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Southern California]].  He specializes in the [[philosophy of language]] and the history of [[analytic philosophy]]. He is well known for defending and expanding on the program in the philosophy of language started by [[Saul Kripke]] as well as being a major critic of [[Two dimensionalism|two-dimensionalist]] theories of meaning.

==Life and career==
Scott Soames was born in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Daily Princeton'' article [http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2004/03/08/news/9870.shtml "Soames leaves for USC, weakening philosophy dept."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020030203/http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2004/03/08/news/9870.shtml |date=2006-10-20 }} of March 8, 2004 reported that he was 58 at that time (2004 - 58 = 1946).&lt;/ref&gt;  He did his undergraduate work in philosophy at [[Stanford University]] and his graduate work at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in linguistics and philosophy.  He received his Ph.D. in philosophy from MIT in 1976.&lt;ref name="usc"&gt;From Soames's web page at USC: http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~soames/{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soames taught briefly at [[Yale University]] (from 1976–1980) and, then, from 1980 to 2004 at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name="usc"/&gt;  His departure from Princeton in 2004 was seen as a major loss at the philosophy department there.  [[Gilbert Harman]], one of Soames's colleagues, was quoted at the time saying that "He's one of the most distinguished people we've got."&lt;ref&gt;The ''Daily Princeton'', [http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2004/03/08/news/9870.shtml "Soames leaves for USC, weakening philosophy dept."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020030203/http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2004/03/08/news/9870.shtml |date=2006-10-20 }}, March 8, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2004, he has been a professor at the [[University of Southern California]], Department of Philosophy.  He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/716/braudy-soames-elected-to-american-academy-of-arts-and-sciences/&lt;/ref&gt;

Soames is a public advocate and supporter of [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarsandwritersforamerica.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
Soames specializes in the [[philosophy of language]] and the history of [[analytic philosophy]]. He has published books and articles primarily on issues concerning [[truth]], [[reference]], and meaning. Fairly early in his career, he and [[Nathan Salmon]] edited a book entitled ''Propositions and Attitudes'' (1989), a collection of readings that investigates philosophical issues surrounding the nature of propositions. Later in his career, Soames has been known for expanding on the anti-descriptivist philosophy of language developed by [[Saul Kripke]] in ''Naming and Necessity'' (1972/1980)—see Soames's ''Beyond Rigidity: The Unfinished Semantic Agenda of 'Naming and Necessity''' (2002).  He is also a major critic of [[Two dimensionalism|two-dimensionalist]] theories of [[semantics]]—see his ''Reference and Description: The Case against Two-Dimensionalism'' (2005).

''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century'' (2003), his two-volume history of analytic philosophy developed from a lecture course regularly given at Princeton, has been the subject of significant controversy among historians of analytic philosophy, with exchanges, often heated, on the ''Notre Dame Philosophical Review'', [[Brian Weatherson]]'s [[blog]], the journal ''The Philosophical Quarterly'', and Soames's own web page.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Soames's [http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~soames/replies/Rep_APA.pdf "Reply to Critics of ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century'': Christopher Pincock, Thomas Hurka, Michael Kremer, and Paul Horwich"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}

'''Sincerity''' is the [[virtue]] of one who communicates and acts in accordance with  their feelings, beliefs, thoughts, and desires.

== Etymology ==
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and most scholars state that ''sincerity'' from ''sincere'' is derived from the Latin ''sincerus'' meaning ''clean, pure, sound'' (1525–35). ''Sincerus'' may have once meant "one growth" (not mixed), from ''sin-'' (one) and ''crescere'' (to grow).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sincerity&amp;searchmode=none Etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Crescere'' is cognate with "[[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]," the goddess of grain, as in
"cereal."&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;Bob Edwards. ''Origin of the word cereal.'' [[National Public Radio]] (NPR). Show: Morning Edition (11:00 AM on ET) October 21, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Heritage Dictionary]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE223.html Bartleby.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017122344/http://bartleby.com/61/roots/IE223.html |date=2007-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Latin word ''sincerus'' is derived from the Indo-European root ''*sm̥kēros'', itself derived from the zero-grade of ''*sem'' (''one'') and the suffixed, lengthened e-grade of ''*ker'' (''grow''), generating the underlying meaning ''of one growth'', hence ''pure, clean.''

=== Controversy ===
An often repeated [[false etymology|folk etymology]] proposes that ''sincere'' is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''sine'' = ''without'', ''cera'' = ''wax''.  According to one popular explanation, dishonest sculptors in [[Rome]] or [[Greece]] would cover flaws in their work with wax to deceive the viewer; therefore, a sculpture "without wax" would mean honesty in its perfection. In its early days the word could refer to the immaterial and material. "One spoke of sincere wine...simply to mean that it had not been adulterated, or, as was once said, sophisticated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sincerity and Authenticity|last=Trilling|first=Lionel|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1972|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another explanation is that this etymology "is derived from a Greeks-bearing-gifts story of deceit and betrayal. For the feat of victory, the Romans demanded the handing over of obligatory tributes. Following bad advice, the Greeks resorted to some faux-marble statues made of wax, which they offered as tribute. These promptly melted in the warm Greek sun."&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Wajnryb. "[http://www.smh.com.au/news/words/if-you-hear-buzzing-get-the-wax-out-of-your-ears/2006/11/16/1163266707150.html If you hear buzzing, get the wax out of your ears]"; Words. ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' (Australia). Spectrum; Books; Pg. 32. November 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] states, however, that "there is no probability in the old explanation from sine cera 'without wax'".

The popularity of the ''without wax'' etymology is reflected in its use as a minor subplot in [[Dan Brown]]'s 1998 thriller novel ''[[Digital Fortress]]'', though Brown attributes it to the [[Spanish language]], not Latin. Reference to the same etymology, this time attributed to Latin, later appears in his 2009 novel, ''[[The Lost Symbol]]''.

==In Western societies==
First discussed by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics#Book 4: Other virtues|Nicomachean Ethics]]'', it resurfaced to become an ideal ([[virtue]]) in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 17th century; and it gained considerable momentum during the [[Romantic movement]], when sincerity was first celebrated as an [[artistic]] and social ideal.  Indeed, in middle to late nineteenth century America, sincerity was an idea reflected in mannerisms, hairstyles, women's dress, and the literature of the time.

More recently sincerity has been under assault by several modern developments such as [[psychoanalysis]] and [[postmodern]] developments such as [[deconstruction]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Some scholars view sincerity as a [[wikt:construct|construct]] rather than a moral virtue—although any virtue can be construed as a 'mere construct' rather than an actual phenomenon{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Because knowledge of self is necessarily subjective, the philosopher Harry Frankfurt has argued that "sincerity itself is bullshit"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56632137|title=On bullshit|last=Frankfurt|first=Harry G.,|date=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691122946|location=Princeton, NJ|oclc=56632137}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Literary critic [[Lionel Trilling]] dealt with the subject of sincerity, its roots, its evolution, its moral quotient, and its relationship to [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] in a series of lectures published under the title ''[[Sincerity and Authenticity]]''.

===Aristotle's views===
According to Aristotle "[[Honesty|truthfulness]] or sincerity is a desirable mean state between the deficiency of [[irony]] or [[self-deprecation]] and the excess of [[boast]]fulness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/ethics/section4.rhtml Sparknotes.com, Ethics, Section 4. Last visited, April 25, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bwq6k-MunOAC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=nicomachean+ethics+and+sincerity&amp;source=web&amp;ots=60d52vT2aj&amp;sig=EppbqkTveUFX6TKx2l0eHMhZwgI&amp;hl=en Google Books Nicomachean Ethics, Book 4, p. 103, 1127b3-31 by Aristotle]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Confucian societies==
''See'' '''''[[w:The Analects|The Analects]]'''''

Beyond the [[Western culture]], sincerity is notably developed as a virtue in [[Confucian]] societies ([[China]], [[Korea]], and [[Japan]]). The concept of ''chéng'' (誠、诚) — as expounded in two of the Confucian classics, the ''Da Xue'' and the ''Zhong Yong'' — is generally translated as ''sincerity''. As in the West, the term implies a congruence of avowal and inner feeling, but inner feeling is in turn ideally responsive to ritual propriety and [[social hierarchy]]. Specifically, Confucian's ''Analects'' contains the following statement in Chapter I: (主忠信。毋友不如己者。過，則勿憚改。) "Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Then no friends would not be like yourself (all friends would be as loyal as yourself). If you make a mistake, do not be afraid to correct it."

Thus, even today, a powerful leader will praise leaders of other realms as "sincere" to the extent that they ''know their place'' in the sense of fulfilling a role in the drama of life. In Japanese the character for ''cheng'' may be pronounced ''makoto'', and carries still more strongly the sense of loyal avowal and belief.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3523">[[File:Tapovan.jpg|thumb|Origin of holy river Ganga]]
'''Tapovan''' ([[Sanskrit]]) comes from the two root words ''tapas'' - meaning penance and by extension religious mortification and austerity, and more generally [[spiritual practice]], and ''vana,'' meaning forest or thicket. ''Tapovan'' then translates as ''forest of austerities or spiritual practice''.

In Honour to the great saint [[Tapovan Maharaj]] this area was named as Tapovan. He authored two books on his travels through the Himalayas: "Wanderings in the Himalayas" (Himagiri Viharam) and "Kailasa Yatra." Tapovan Maharaj exhibited a deep love for nature and his accounts of his travels demonstrate such.[citation needed] His autobiography, written in Sanskrit is titled "Ishvara Darshana". After observance of rites and rituals following the Master's last earthly breath (1957), Shri Swami Tapovan Maharaj's body was interred into the holy Ganga by a procession of Sadhus. To this present day, there is a simple, solemn and dignified way in which the Uttarkashi monks mark the samaadhi of any sadhu and Swami Tapovan Maharaj represents the ideal of austerity and pinnacle of wisdom which all anchorites aspire to.

Traditionally in India, any place where someone has engaged in serious spiritual retreat may become known as a tapovan, even if there is no forest. As well as particular caves and other hermitages where sages and [[sadhu]]s have dwelt, there are some places, such as the western bank of the northern [[Ganges]] river around [[Rishikesh]], that have been so used by hermits that the whole area has become known as a ''tapovan''.

==Tapovan (place)==
[[File:Tapovan from above Aditya Asopa.jpg|alt=panoramic view of Tapovan from 100 metres above|thumb|Tapovan from 100 metre above. Alt. 4478 metre ASL.]]
The most well known ''tapovan'' in India is the area above the [[Gangotri Glacier]] at one of the primary [[River source|sources]] of the [[Ganges]], in [[Uttarakhand]], [[India]]. At the foot of [[Shivling (Garhwal Himalaya)|Shivling]] peak, a barren area at about 4,463m (14640 feet) elevation, is a seasonal home to several sadhus living in caves, huts etc. and it has become a trekking destination also.&lt;ref name=trek&gt;{{cite web|title=Gomukh Tapovan Trek|url=http://www.tourmyindia.com.au/tour-pdf/Gomukh-Tapovan-Trek.pdf|publisher=Tourmyindia.com|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trekking usually starts from [[Gomukh]] and the trek was considered moderate to difficult &lt;ref name=trek/&gt; prior to the destruction of much of the trail from Gangotri to Gamukh by the [[2013 North Indian Floods]].  Tapovan area is base camp for several mountaineering expeditions including Shivling peak, Bhagirathi peak etc. Tapovan area is full of meadows, streams and flowering plants and the meadows are considered as one of the best high altitude meadow in India.&lt;ref name=trek/&gt; There is also a place named Nandanvan near Tapovan, and Nandanvan is also trekked by trekkers and pilgrims.&lt;ref name=trek/&gt; Nandanvan is also a spacious meadow located at the base of Bhagirathi massif.&lt;ref name=source&gt;{{cite web|title=The Source of the Ganges Trek|url=http://www.exotic-himalayas.com/sources-ganges-trekking.html|publisher=the exotic himalayas.com|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion''''' is a 2012 [[social psychology]] book by [[Jonathan Haidt]], in which the author describes [[human]] [[morality]] as it relates to politics and religion.

==Summary==
In the first part of the book, the author uses research to demonstrate [[social intuitionism]], how people's beliefs come primarily from their intuitions, and rational thought often comes after to justify initial beliefs. In the second portion of the book, he presents [[moral foundations theory]], and applies it to the political beliefs of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]], [[conservatives]], and [[libertarians]] in the [[US]].

Haidt argues that people are too quick to denigrate other points of view without giving those views full consideration, and attempts to reach common ground between liberals and conservatives. He makes the case in the book for morality having multiple foundations (more than just harm and fairness), and said in an interview that morality "is at least six things, and probably a lot more than that"&lt;ref name="POI20120319"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jonathan Haidt — The Righteous Mind|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/jonathan_haidt_the_righteous_mind/|website=[[Point of Inquiry]]|publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]]|accessdate=12 December 2016|format=MP3 Podcast|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8:55}} and "[religion and politics are] ... expressions of our tribal, groupish, righteous nature".&lt;ref name="POI20120319"/&gt;{{rp|13:06}} Haidt himself acknowledges that while he has been a liberal all his life,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/01/jonathan_haidt.html&lt;/ref&gt; he is now more open to other points of view.&lt;ref name="Saletan.2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/the-righteous-mind-by-jonathan-haidt.html?pagewanted=all | title=Why Won't They Listen?

'''Upaviṣṭa Koṇāsana''' ([[Sanskrit]] उपविष्टकोणासन), also written '''Upavistha Konasana''' or "wide-angle seated forward bend"&lt;ref name="Rosen 2007"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Richard |title=Wide-Angle Seated Forward Bend |url=https://www.yogajournal.com/poses/wide-angle-seated-forward-bend |publisher=Yoga Journal |accessdate=18 November 2018 |date=28 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ekhart/&gt; is a [[hatha yoga]] pose, sitting upright with the legs as wide apart as possible, grasping the toes and leaning forward.&lt;ref name="Mehta 1990"&gt;Mehta, 1990 p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name of the pose is from the [[Sanskrit]] उपविष्ट (upavishta) meaning "open", कोण (kon) meaning "angle", and आस (asana), meaning "seat" or "pose".&lt;ref name="Mehta 1990"/&gt;

==Description==
The pose may be entered from [[dandasana]] (staff pose) by moving the legs apart as far as possible. The big toes may then be grasped with the hands, or with a belt around each foot. The back is lightly arched by raising the coccyx, and the body is inclined forwards.&lt;ref name="Botur 2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Botur |first1=Amanda |title=Wide-Angle Seated Forward Bend • Upavistha Konasana |url=https://www.yogatoday.com/poses/wide-angle-seated-forward-bend |publisher=Yoga Today |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehta 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iyengar 1979"&gt;Iyengar, 1979, pp. 163–165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ekhart&gt;{{cite web |title=Wide-Angle Seated Forward Bend - Upavishta Konasana |url=https://www.ekhartyoga.com/resources/poses/wide-angle-seated-forward-bend |publisher=Ekhart Yoga |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the completed pose, the body leans forwards until the chin and nose touch the ground.&lt;ref name="Mehta 1990"/&gt; People who cannot sit on the floor in dandasana can sit on a folded blanket for the pose.&lt;ref name="Rosen 2007"/&gt;

A variation is to lean forward and to place the hands, palms up, on the ground in front of the body.&lt;ref name="Rosen 2007"/&gt;

==Claimed benefits==
The pose provides a stretch for the hamstrings,&lt;ref name="Iyengar 1979"/&gt; and is stated without evidence in ''[[Light on Yoga]]'' to assist the circulation in the pelvic region and to relieve sciatica.&lt;ref name="Iyengar 1979"/&gt; The pose is stated, again without evidence, to be useful for "gynaecological problems",&lt;ref name="Mehta 1990"/&gt; and safe in both menstruation and pregnancy provided no strain is applied.&lt;ref name="Mehta 1990"/&gt; However, the ashtanga yoga master K. Pattabhi Jois states that it should not be performed in pregnancy, though agreeing on its benefit for the sciatic nerve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jois |first=K. Pattabhi |title=Yoga Mala: The Seminal Treatise and Guide from the Living Master of Ashtanga Yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hPMEgVYgTeoC&amp;pg=PA96 |year=2010 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-1-4299-6506-4 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;
