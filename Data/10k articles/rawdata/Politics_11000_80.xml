The killings have been described as a political purge without precedent in modern Iranian history, both in terms of scope and coverup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abrahamian|first=Ervand|title=Tortured Confessions Prisons and Public Recantations in Modern Iran|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=210|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft3s2005jq;chunk.id=0;doc.view=print}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the exact number of prisoners executed remains a point of contention. [[Amnesty International]] recorded the names of over 4,482 disappeared prisoners during this time,&lt;ref name="amnesty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/021/1990/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then-[[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]'s deputy, [[Hussein-Ali Montazeri]] put the number between 2,800 and 3,800 in his memoirs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Schwerin|first=Ulrich|title=The Dissident Mullah: Ayatollah Montazeri and the Struggle for Reform in Revolutionary Iran|year=2015|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857737748}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an alternative estimation suggests that the number exceeded 30,000.&lt;ref name="Lamb"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Christina|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/1321090/Khomeini-fatwa-led-to-killing-of-30000-in-Iran.html|title=Khomeini fatwa 'led to killing of 30,000 in Iran'|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2001-02-04|accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Great care was taken to keep the killings undercover, and the government of Iran currently denies their having taken place. Justifications offered for the alleged executions vary, but one of the most common theories advanced is that they were in retaliation for the 1988 [[Operation Mersad|attack]] on the western borders of Iran by the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]]. However, this does not fully account for the targeting of other leftist groups who opposed the Mujahedin invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Survivors of the massacre have made various calls for justice&lt;ref name=UNCall /&gt; and prosecution for the event. Canada has called the event a [[crimes against humanity|crime against humanity]],&lt;ref name=Canadrec /&gt; and Italy has made similar declarations for justice to be served.&lt;ref name=Italyrec /&gt;

[[File:Gholamreza Hassani (Left) and Ruhollah Khomeini.jpg|thumb|Ruhollah Khomeini]]

=== Khomeini's order ===
Shortly before the executions commenced, Iranian leader [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] issued "a secret but extraordinary order – some suspect a formal [[fatwa]]." This set up "Special Commissions with instructions to execute members of People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran as ''[[Moharebeh|moharebs]]'' (those who war against [[Allah]]) and [[leftist]]s as ''[[Apostasy in Islam|mortads]]'' (apostates from Islam)."&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, Ervand 1999, p.210"&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Tortured Confessions'', University of California Press, 1999, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In part the letter reads:

{{blockquote|از آنجا که منافقین خائن به هیچ وجه به اسلام معتقد نبوده و هر چه میگویند از روی حیله و نفاق آنهاست و به اقرار سران آنها از اسلام ارتداد پیدا کرده‌اند، با توجه به محارب بودن آنها و جنگ کلاسیک آنها در شمال و غرب و جنوب کشور با همکاری‌های حزب بعث عراق و نیز جاسوسی آنها برای صدام علیه ملت مسلمان ما و با توجه به ارتباط آنان با استکبار جهانی و ضربات ناجوانمردانهٔ آنان از ابتدای تشکیل نظام جمهوری اسلامی تا کنون، کسانی که در زندانهای سراسر کشور بر سر موضع نفاق خود پافشاری کرده و میکنند، محارب و محکوم به اعدام میباشند.&lt;ref&gt;Upholding the truth (''Pasdasht e Haghighat'') (رضایی و سلیمی نمین، پاسداشت حقیقت) by [[Mohsen Rezaee]] and Abbas Salimi-Namin.

[''In the Name of God,
''The Compassionate, the Merciful,'']&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:67letter.gif|thumb|Khomeini's order]]
''As the treacherous Monafeqin [Mojahedin] do not believe in Islam and what they say is out of deception and hypocrisy, and &lt;br /&gt;
''As their leaders have confessed that they have become renegades, and &lt;br /&gt;
''As they are waging war on God, and &lt;br /&gt;
''As they are engaging in classical warfare in the western, the northern and the southern fronts, and &lt;br /&gt;
''As they are collaborating with the Baathist Party of Iraq and spying for Saddam against our Muslim nation, and &lt;br /&gt;
''As they are tied to the World Arrogance, and in light of their cowardly blows to the Islamic Republic since its inception,&lt;br /&gt;
''It is decreed that those who are in prison throughout the country and remain steadfast in their support for the Monafeqin [Mojahedin] are waging war on God and are condemned to execution.''

=== Administering of the executions ===
[[File:Evin Prison, 1980's.jpg|thumb|left|[[Evin prison]] in 1980's.]]
In [[Tehran]] the special commission for the executions had 16 members representing the various authorities of the Islamic government – Imam Khomeini himself, the president, the chief prosecutor, the [[Islamic Revolutionary Court|Revolutionary Tribunals]], the Ministries of Justice and [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran|Intelligence]], and the administration of [[Evin Prison|Evin]] and [[Gohardasht Prison|Gohar Dasht]], the two prisons in the Tehran area from which the prisoner were eliminated. The chair of the commission was Ayatollah [[Morteza Eshraqi]]. His two special assistants were Hojatt al-Islam [[Jaafar Nayyeri|Hossein-Ali Nayyeri]] and Hojjat al-Islam [[Ali Mobasheri (judge)|Ali Mobasheri]]. The commission shuttled back and forth between Evin and Gohar Dasht prisons by helicopter. In the provinces similar commissions were established, but less is known about them.&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, Ervand 1999, p.210" /&gt;

Another description of the administration of the executions has it implemented by a "four-man commission, later known as the 'death committee'."&lt;ref name=sotoudeh&gt;{{cite web|title=Nasrin Sotoudeh: Investigate Iranian Presidential Hopeful Ebrahim Raisi for 1988 Mass Executions|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2017/04/nasrin-sotoudeh-investigate-iranian-presidential-hopeful-ebrahim-raisi-for-1988-mass-executions/|website=Center for Human Rights in Iran|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members were [[Jaafar Nayyeri|Hossein-Ali Nayyeri]] (who was then a judge), [[Morteza Eshraqi]] (then Tehran Prosecutor), [[Ebrahim Raisi]] (then Deputy Prosecutor General) and [[Mostafa Pourmohammadi]] (then the representative of the Intelligence Ministry in Evin Prison).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2017/05/an-interview-with-scholar-and-historian-ervand-abrahamian-on-the-islamic-republics-greatest-crime/|title=An Interview with Scholar and Historian Ervand Abrahamian on the Islamic Republic's "Greatest Crime"|last=Abrahamian|first=Ervand|date=4 May 2017|website=Center for Human Rights in Iran|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ebrahim Raisi]], went on to campaign for [[Iranian presidential election, 2017|president of Iran in 2017]] as a hard-line conservative where he was criticized for his role in the executions.&lt;ref name=sotoudeh /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The prisoners were not executed without any proceedings, but were "tried" on charges totally unrelated to the charges that had landed them in prison. They were interviewed by commissions with a set list of questions to see if they qualified as ''[[Moharebeh|moharebs]]'' or ''[[Apostasy in Islam|mortads]]'' to the satisfaction of that commission. Many, if not most, of the prisoners were unaware of the true purpose of the questions, although later some were warned by the prison [[Grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]].

Some of the victims were killed because of their beliefs about religion – because they were atheists or because they were Muslims who followed different versions of Islam.

=== Isolation of the prisoners ===
Some scholarly examinations of the massacre argue that the planning stages of the 1988 Massacre began months before the actual executions started. According to one report: "prison officials took the unusual step in late 1987 and early 1988 of re-questioning and separating all political prisoners according to party affiliation and length of sentence."&lt;ref&gt;Kaveh Sharooz, "With Revolutionary Rage and Rancor: A Preliminary Report on the 1988 Massacre of Iran's Political Prisoners", ''Harvard Human Rights Journal'', Volume 20, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual execution process began in the early hours of 19 July 1988 with the isolation of the political prisoners from the outside world. Prison gates were closed, scheduled visits and telephone calls were canceled, letters, care packages, and even vital medicines from the outside were turned away, the main law courts went on an unscheduled vacation. Even relatives of prisoners were forbidden to congregate outside the prison gates.

Inside the prison, cell blocks were isolated from each other and cleared of radios and televisions. Places where prisoners gathered communally, such as lecture halls, workshops, infirmaries, were all closed down and inmates were confined to their cells. Prison guards and workers were ordered not to speak to prisoners. One prisoner constructed a homemade wireless set to listen to the radio news from the outside but found news broadcasters were saying nothing at all about the lockdown.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), pp. 209-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People's Mujahedin of Iran ===
The first prisoners to be interviewed or "tried" were the male members of the ''[[People's Mujahedin of Iran]]'', including those who had repented of their association with the group. The commission prefaced the proceedings with the false assurance that this was not a trial but a process for initiating a general amnesty and separating the Muslims from the non-Muslims.

It first asked their organisational affiliation; if they replied "''[[Mojahedin]]''", the questioning ended there. If they replied ''monafeqin'' (hypocrites), the commission continued with such questions as:

*'Are you willing to denounce former colleagues?'
*'Are you willing to denounce them in front of the cameras?'
*'Are you willing to help us hunt them down?'
*'Will you name secret sympathizers?'
*'Will you identify phony repenters?'
*'Will you go to the war front and walk through enemy [[minefields]]?'

Not surprisingly, almost all the prisoners failed to answer in the affirmative to all the questions. These were then taken to another room and ordered to write their last will and testament and to discard any personal belongings such as rings, watches, and spectacles. They were then blindfolded and taken to the gallows where they were hanged in batches of six. Since "hanging" did not mean death by breaking of the neck by drop through a trap door, but stringing up the victim by the neck to suffocate, some took fifteen minutes to die.

After the first few days, the overworked executioners requested [[firing squad]]s. These requests were rejected on the claim that the Shari'a mandated hanging for apostates and enemies of Allah, though it is thought that the real reason may have been that hanging was quieter than gunfire and would thus better preserve the secrecy of the operations.

At first this secrecy was effective. "One survivor admits that he thought he was being processed to be released in time for the forthcoming peace celebrations."&lt;ref&gt;'Interview with Two Survivors of the Mass Killings,' ''Ettehad-e Kar'' 41 (August 1997), quoted in Abrahamian,  ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dealing with leftists ===
After 27 August, the commission turned its attention to the leftist [[prisoner]]s, such as members of the [[Tudeh]], Majority [[Fedayeen#Iran|Fedayi]], Minority Fedayi, other Fedayi, Kumaleh, Rah-e Kargar, [[Peykar]]. These were also assured they were in no danger and asked: {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

*'Are you a [[Muslim]]?'
*'Do you believe in [[Allah]]?'
*'Is the [[Holy Qur'an]] the Word of Allah?'
*'Do you believe in [[Jannah|Heaven]] and [[Jahannam|Hell]]?'
*'Do you accept the Holy [[Muhammad]] to be the [[Seal of the Prophets]]?'
*'Will you publicly recant historical materialism?'
*'Will you denounce your former beliefs before the cameras?'
*'Do you [[Fasting in Islam|fast]] during [[Ramadan]]?'
*'Do you pray and read the [[Holy Qur'an]]?'
*'Would you rather share a cell with a Muslim or a non-Muslim?'
*'Will you sign an affidavit that you believe in Allah, the Prophet, the Holy Qur'an, and the Resurrection?'
*'When you were growing up, did your father pray, fast, and read the Holy Qur'an?'

Prisoners were told that authorities were asking them these questions because they planned to separate practicing Muslims from non-practicing ones. However, the real reason was to determine whether the prisoners qualified as apostates from Islam, in which case they would join the ''moharebs'' in the gallows.

Some prisoners saved from execution by answering the questions properly returned to their cells and passed along what the commission was asking. A leftist prisoner "who had at one time attended a seminary quickly grasped the theological significance of the questions" and "spent the night of August 30 sending [[morse code]] messages to other cells" by knocking on the prison walls. He pointed "out the hidden dangers." The questioners wanted to know if prisoners' fathers prayed, fasted, and read the Qur'an because the sons of devout men could be called apostates. If they had not been raised in proper Muslim homes first and "exposed to true Islam," they could not be apostates. Another wrong answer was refusing to reply "on the grounds of 'privacy'," which "could itself be taken as an admission of 'apostasy'."&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian,  ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

All this was a surprise to the prisoners, with one commenting: "In previous years, they wanted us to confess to spying. In 1988, they wanted us to convert to Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, 'The Islamic Law of Repentance,' Aksariyat 18 May 1989 quoted in Abrahamian,  ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), pp. 212-3.&lt;/ref&gt; It also meant there was no correlation between the length of sentence being served and the likelihood of death. "The first leftist to go before the Evin commission were those with light, and even completed, sentences." These had no warning of what was in store and many died.

=== Dealing with women ===
Mojahedin women were given equal treatment with Mojahedin men, almost all hanged as 'armed enemies of Allah' However, for apostasy the punishment for women was different and lighter than that for men.  Since according to the commission's interpretation of Islamic law, women were not fully responsible for their actions, "disobedient women – including apostates – could be given discretionary punishments to mend their ways and obey male superiors."

Leftist women—even those raised as practicing Muslims—were given another 'opportunity' to recant their 'apostasy.'  "After the investigation, leftist women were all given five lashes for every one of the five daily prayers missed, half the punishment meted out to the men. After a while, many agreed to pray, but some went on hunger strike, refusing even water. One died after 22 days and 550 lashes, and the authorities certified her death as suicide because it was 'she who had made the decision not to pray.'"&lt;ref&gt;E. Mahbaz (pseudonym, 'The Islamic Republic of Iran – The Hell for women: Seven Years in Prison" (unpublished paper, 1996), quoted in Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Families ===
According to Iranian human rights lawyer [[Shirin Ebadi]], executed prisoner's families were told: 'For one year you shall refrain from holding a [[funeral]], or mourning his death in any public way. If after one year your conduct is deemed acceptable, we will reveal to you his place of burial.' The justification given to these families for the execution of their loved ones was that the prisoner's name had appeared on notes pinned to PMOI members killed in the Mersad attack whose bodies had been recovered by Iranian Islamic officials. The notes listing the PMOI's supporters' in prison so the prisoners had been guilty of aiding the attack. Ebadi complained that aside from being improbable, this did not explain why the prisoners had not received a trial for the charge of giving support to the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Ebadi, Shirin, ''Iran Awakening'', by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House New York, 2006, pp. 87, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; A report by [[Geoffrey Robertson]] QC accused Tehran of continuing to deny relatives of the victims their right to know where their loved ones are buried.&lt;ref name= Geoffrey&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.doughtystreet.co.uk/files/Iran%20Massacre%20Report.pdf |format=pdf |title=The Massacre of Political Prisoners in Iran, 1988 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705022536/http://www.doughtystreet.co.uk/files/Iran%20Massacre%20Report.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-05 |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estimates of fatalities ===
One anonymous ex-prisoner places the death toll in the 'thousands.'  Another eyewitness puts in between 5000 and 6000 – 1000 from the left and the rest from the Mojahedin.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, 'I Was Witness to the Slaughter of Political Prisoners in Gohar Dasht,' Cheshmandaz, n.14 (Winter 1995): 68, quoted in Abrahamian,  ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another estimates it in the 'thousands', with as many as 1500 killed at Gohar Dasht prison alone.&lt;ref&gt;K. Homayun, 'The Slaughter at Gohar Dasht', Kar 62, (April 1992), quoted in Abrahamian,  ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study using scattered information from the provinces places the figure at 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;N. Mohajer, 'The Mass Killings in Iran' Aresh 57 (August 1996): 7, quoted in Abrahamian,  ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International estimates that the national total is more than 2500 and describes the vast majority of the victims as 'prisoners of conscience' as they had not been charged with actual deeds or plans of deeds against the state.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International. Iran: Violations of Human Rights, 1987–1990 (London, 1991) 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is extremely difficult to get an accurate number since many killings were carried out in remote Kurdish and Baluchi cities. It could be as high as 30,000 according to figures provided by Iranian defectors.&lt;ref name="Lamb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ncr-iran.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncr-iran.org/en/editorial/16518-ex-khamenei-crony-33-000-executed-during-1988-massacre-of-political-prisoners-in-iran|title=NCRI – National Council of Resistance of Iran – Ex-Khamenei crony: 33,000 executed during 1988 massacre of political prisoners in Iran|author=Super User|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the 2009 uprisings in Iran, a defector of the Iranian regime Mohammad Nurizad stated over 33,000 people were massacred within 2–3 months in the summer of 1988.&lt;ref name="ncr-iran.org" /&gt; It is estimated that most of the executed were either high school or college students or fresh graduates, and over 10% were women.&lt;ref&gt;Ebadi, Shirin, ''Iran Awakening'', by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House New York, 2006, pp. 90-1.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Christina Lamb, writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'': "Secret documents smuggled out of Iran reveal that, because of the large numbers of necks to be broken, prisoners were loaded onto forklift trucks in groups of six and hanged from cranes in half-hourly intervals."&lt;ref name="Lamb" /&gt;

=== International reaction and criticism ===
On 30 August 2017, the [[The United Nations|United Nations]] [[Human Rights Council]] highlighted the 1988 massacre and distributed a written statement by three [[non-governmental organizations]] titled, "The 1988 Massacre of Political Prisoners in Iran: Time for the Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence"&lt;ref&gt;[http://iranprobe.com/crime-against-humanity/2117.html United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and NGOs condemned human rights violations in Iran]&lt;/ref&gt; The  statement  points to the following: In 1988, the government of Iran massacred 30,000 political prisoners. The executions took place based on a fatwa by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Three-member commissions known as a ‘Death Commission’ were formed across Iran sending political prisoners who refused to abandon their beliefs to execution. The victims were buried in secret mass graves. The perpetrators continue to enjoy impunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://undocs.org/A/HRC/36/NGO/42 On the 29th anniversary of the 1988 mass extra-legal executions of political prisoners in the Islamic Republic of Iran]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another  joint written statement by five NGOs with consultative status with the United Nations was circulated during the UN Human Rights Council in February 2018 urged “UN to launch fact-finding mission to investigate Iran’s 1988 [[Mass murder|massacre]] in order to end [[impunity]] and prevent the same fate for detained protesters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G18/042/97/PDF/G1804297.pdf?OpenElement Written statement by NGOs on Iran, during Human Rights Council ]&lt;/ref&gt;”

== Response ==

=== Montazeri ===
[[File:Montazeri khomeyni.JPG|thumb|Deputy Supreme Leader [[Hussein Ali-Montazeri]] condemned the executions. He was dismissed by Khomeini and later placed under [[house arrest]]]]
One of the consequences of the killings was the resignation of [[Hussein-Ali Montazeri]] as the heir-designate to Ayatollah Khomeini as Supreme Leader of Iran.
Prior to the killings, Montazeri "had taken issue with the diehard cleric on a number of subjects – the trial of [[Mehdi Hashemi]], the anti-hoarding campaign ..." When he heard of the killings Montazeri rushed off three public letters – two to Khomeini, one to the Special Commission – denouncing the executions "in no uncertain terms." He also took the Special Commission "to task for violating Islam by executing repenters and minor offenders who in a proper court of law would have received a mere reprimand."&lt;ref&gt;editor, 'Montazeri's Letters,' Cheshmandaz, n.6 (Summer 1989), 35-37, quoted in Abrahamian,  ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), p.220&lt;/ref&gt; Montazeri warned Khomeini: "The execution of several thousand prisoners in a few days will not have positive repercussions and will not be mistake-free."&lt;ref name="Lamb" /&gt;

Montazeri was asked to resign, with Khomeini maintaining he had always been doubtful of Montazeri's competence and that 'I expressed reservations when the Assembly of Experts first appointed you.'" But the Assembly of Experts had insisted on naming Montazeri the future Supreme Leader.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian,  ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

The regime published letters between the two Ayatollahs but "the selection dealt only with the Hashemi affair and scrupulously avoided the mass executions – thus observing the official line that these executions never took place."&lt;ref&gt;''Ranjnameh-e Hazrat Hojjat al-Islam va al-Muslman Aqa-ye Hajj Sayyed Ahmad Khomeini beh Hazrat Ayatollah Montazeri'' (Tehran, 1990), quoted in Abrahamian,  ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August 2016, a website run by followers of Montazeri published an audio recording from a meeting he held on August 15, 1988 with the special judicial tribunal (Tehran Prosecutor Morteza Eshraghi, Judge Hossein-Ali Nayeri, Deputy Prosecutor General [[Ebrahim Raeesi]] and [[Ministry of Intelligence|MOIS]] representative in Evin [[Mostafa Pourmohammadi]]).&lt;ref name="Audio file"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://audio.rferl.org/FRD/2016/08/09/f2720a29-b951-4fc6-855a-c18cd25baef0.mp3|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|accessdate=12 August 2016|title=audio.rferl.org/FRD/2016/08/09/f2720a29-b951-4fc6-855a-c18cd25baef0.mp3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICHR: Recording taken off"&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran's Intelligence Ministry Tries to Hide Evidence of Massacre of Thousands of Political Prisoners in 1988|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/08/ahmad-montazeri/|website=International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran|publisher=N/A|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can hear Montazeri condemning the mass executions.

=== Other criticism ===
[[File:Mostafa Pourmohammadi portrait (3).jpg|thumb|left|[[Mostafa Pourmohammadi]], one of the judges who known as "Judges of Death". He was later became minister of justice under President [[Hassan Rouhani]]]]
One complaint made against the mass killings was that almost all the prisoners executed had been arrested for relatively minor offenses, since those with serious charges had already been executed. The 1988 killings resembled the 'disappearances' of prisoners in 20th-century Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian,  ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kaveh Shahrooz, writing in Gozaar, a publication sponsored by [[Freedom House]], "it is baffling that two of the world's most powerful human rights organizations, [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], have simply never written full reports on a crime as widespread as the 1988 extermination campaign."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gozaar.org/template1.php?id=1078&amp;language=english Twenty Years of Silence: The 1988 Massacre and the Quest for Accountability] {{Webarchive|url=https://swap.stanford.edu/20090128162654/https://www.gozaar.org/template1.php?id=1078&amp;language=english |date=2009-01-28 }}, Gozaar&lt;/ref&gt;

While Amnesty International's report "Iran: Violations of Human Rights 1987-1990" published in 1990 devotes a few pages to the massacre, the human rights organization has never written a full report on the killings.&lt;ref name="amnesty" /&gt; The Amnesty International report states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The political executions took place in many prisons in all parts of Iran, often far from where the armed incursion took place. Most of the executions were of political prisoners, including an unknown number of prisoners of conscience, who had already served a number of years in prison. They could have played no part in the armed incursion, and they were in no position to take part in spying or terrorist activities. Many of the dead had been tried and sentenced to prison terms during the early 1980s, many for non-violent offences such as distributing newspapers and leaflets, taking part in demonstrations or collecting funds for prisoners' families. Many of the dead had been students in their teens or early twenties at the time of their arrest. The majority of those killed were supporters of the PMOI, but hundreds of members and supporters of other political groups, including various factions of the PFOI, the Tudeh Party, the KDPI, Rah-e Kargar and others, were also among the execution victims.&lt;ref name="amnesty" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, Human Rights Watch devotes a mere handful of pages to the massacre in a background report concerning President Ahmadinejad's cabinet picks.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;[http://hrw.org/backgrounder/mena/iran1205/2.htm HRW – ''Pour-Mohammadi and the 1988 Prison Massacres'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) has described the executions as "deliberate and systematic ... extrajudicial killings," and has condemned them as [[crimes against humanity]]. HRW has also accused Mustafa Pour-Mohammadi, Iran's Interior Minister from 2005–2008, of direct involvement in the killings.&lt;ref name="hrw.org" /&gt;

UN Judge and leading human rights lawyer, [[Geoffrey Robertson]] QC has urged the UN [[Security Council]] to set up a special court, along the lines of the International Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, to try the men involved "for one of the worst single [[human rights]] atrocities since the [[Second World War]]."&lt;ref name= Geoffrey /&gt;

== Motivation ==
Scholars disagree over why the prisoners were killed. Ali Akbar Mahdi believes the intense overcrowding of Iranian prisons and the July 1988 Mojahedin [[Operation Mersad]] offensive "had much to do" with the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Review by Ali Akbar Mahdi of ''Tortured Confessions: Prison and Public Recantations in Modern Iran'', in ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' © 2000, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; Ervand Abrahamian believes the "regime's internal dynamics" were responsible – the need for "a glue" to hold "together his disparate followers" and a "bloodbath" to "purge" moderates like Montazeri and prevent any future "détente with the West" from destroying his legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian,  ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the killings destroyed any ties, or possibility of ties, between populists in the Khomeini movement on the one hand, and non-Khomeiniist Islamist and secular leftists on the other. Khomeini had been concerned that "some of his followers had toyed with the dangerous notion of working with the [[Tudeh Party]] to incorporate more radical clauses into the Labor Law as well as into the Land Reform Law" earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''History of Modern Iran'', Columbia University Press, 2008, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iran Tribunal ==
In 2012 the families of the victims, along with the survivors of the mass executions initiated an international Commission, the [[Iran Tribunal]], in order to investigate the mass killing of Iran's political prisoners. "Iran Tribunal" is aiming to hold the Iran's Islamic Regime accountable for its crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name="Iran Tribunal"&gt;[http://www.irantribunal.com/Eng/EnHome.html – ''"May this Tribunal prevent the crime of silence"…?'']&lt;/ref&gt; The first session of court hearing was organized in London and the second one at The Hague Peace Palace.&lt;ref name="Persian Dutch Network"&gt;[http://persiandutch.com/2012/10/27/photo-gallery-court-hearing-in-the-hague-for-1980s-massacre-in-persia/ - ''"Court Hearing in The Hague for 1980s Massacre in Persia"…?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iranian Authorities Position ==
Pour Mohammadi, who was speaking in the administrative council meeting in the city of Khorram-Abad in Lorestan province, on 28 August said: "We are proud we have implemented God’s order about Mojahedin (PMOI or MEK)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/persian/iran/2016/08/160828_l26_pormohammadi_iran_executions_67_mojahedin_mko |title=پورمحمدی درباره اعدام‌های ۶۷: افتخار می‌کنیم حکم خدا را اجرا کردیم |language=Persian |trans-title=67 executions: proud to have performed the commandment of God |date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Armed Forces of Malta.png|right|thumb|445px|Structure of the Armed Forces of Malta]]

The '''Armed Forces of Malta''' is the name given to the combined armed services of [[Malta]]. The AFM is a [[brigade]] sized organisation consisting of a headquarters and three separate [[battalion]]s, with minimal air and naval forces. Since Malta is the guardian of the [[European Union]]'s most southerly border, the AFM has an active role in border control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/doc_centre/borders/docs/List%20of%20national%20services%20responsible%20for%20border%20control.pdf List of national services responsible for border control]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In April 1800, while the [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|blockade of Valletta]] was underway, [[Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch|Thomas Graham]] raised the first official Maltese Troops in the British Army, which became known as the [[Maltese Light Infantry]]. This battalion of men was disbanded in 1802 and succeeded by the [[Maltese Provincial Battalions]], the [[Malta Coast Artillery]] and the [[Maltese Veterans]]. In 1815, Lieutenant Colonel Count Francis Rivarola was entrusted with the task of raising the [[Royal Malta Fencible Regiment]] following the disbandment of the Provincials, Veterans and Coast Artillery. The Royal Malta Fencible Regiment was converted to an artillery regiment in 1861, and became known as the [[Royal Malta Fencible Artillery]]. Twenty-eight years later, the worthy predecessors of the Armed Forces of Malta came into existence following the formation of the [[Royal Malta Artillery]] on March 23, 1889.

The King's Own Malta Regiment was a territorial infantry regiment on the [[British Army]] colonial list. It was formed in 1801 as the "[[Maltese Militia#1801–1802|Regiment of Maltese Militia]]", existing only until the following year. It was reformed as the "[[Maltese Militia#1852–1857|Maltese Militia]]" by Sir [[Adrian Dingli]] in 1852 before disbanding again in 1857. It was raised again, this time as the "Royal Malta Regiment of Militia" in 1889; this regiment was considered to be the successor to the "Maltese Chasseurs" of the early 19th century. The regiment was renamed the "King's Own Royal Malta Regiment of Militia" in 1903, and was disbanded in 1921. The regiment was raised for a fourth time in 1931 as the "King's Own Malta Regiment". Initially on the British Establishment, in 1951 it was transferred to the Malta Territorial Force before becoming part of the Malta Land Force on Malta's independence in 1970. The regiment was disbanded in 1972.

The AFM was formed upon Malta becoming a [[republic]] in 1974, when 1 Regiment [[Royal Malta Artillery]] was renamed as 1 Regiment, AFM. This initially continued the artillery role, with 2 Regiment formed as an engineers unit. In 1980, 1 Regiment became a mixed unit, with infantry, aircraft and maritime responsibilities, the artillery element being transferred to 2 Regiment. In 1992, there was a major re-organisation, which led to the formation of 3 Regiment and the current structure.

== Equipment ==
On land, 1 Regiment is the designated home of the Maltese Infantry with C (Special Duties) Company being at the cutting edge of this unit. The company is being trained and equipped to be able to contribute a platoon for overseas humanitarian and rescue missions attached to an Italian regiment on missions mandated by the UN or the OSCE. Malta has to ensure that the troops are adequately trained and equipped up to Italian army standards for seamless integration within an Italian regiment, able to tackle any foreseeable problems for up to a year. C (Special Duties) Company is also being geared for a quick reaction role, ready for action at a moment’s notice should an emergency, such as terrorism, arise.

The kit used by the Maltese foot soldier has changed drastically in recent years. The fiat for change was given to C Company prior to its successful participation in the multi-national Partnership for Peace exercise in 1996. Following Malta’s pledge towards the EU’s Military Headline Goal in 2000, procurement received another boost.

With funding being a perennial problem, over the years the Force had to rely on varied equipment transferred or financed by several countries. Standardisation was a headache. But matters have improved considerably, especially with regard to light infantry weapons. At one time there were as many as eight different types of pistol and associated ammunition, now there are two, principally the Beretta FS and some Makarov. The army has also bought Heckler and Koch sub-machine guns and, thanks to Chinese assistance, all infantrymen now have their own individual AKM rifle.

The Maltese Infantry soldier is equipped with the latest British Army issue Personal Load Bearing Equipment including both the webbing and bergen as well as the woodland pattern battle dress uniform, Avon S10 respirator and Kevlar ballistic helmet. Protective ballistic vests and night vision goggles are carried when required.

Infantry soldiers have a number of weapons at their disposal including the Kalashnikov AK-47 and AKM rifles, the Heckler and Koch MP 5 sub-machine guns, the Beretta 92 FS pistols, the PKM machine gun, as well as the General Purpose Machine Gun L7A1. Sniper teams are equipped with the Accuracy International sniper rifle while the anti-tank troops embedded within the infantry platoons carry the RPG-7 rocket launcher.

Eight-man sections are deployed either on Landrovers or Iveco VM-90 trucks.The AFM also operates a number of Bedford trucks which, despite their age, still give excellent service. Suffice to say that these trucks were driven in convoys all the way to Kosovo and back three times in 2001 and not one of them broke down. The Explosives Ordnance Disposal Unit is equipped with two remote controlled Explosive Ordnance Disposal Vehicles – robots used to disable a bomb from a safe distance. The first was bought in 1989 and a second, much more sophisticated one, was bought last year.

The Air Defence Battery forms part of 2nd Regiment and operates Bofors 40L/70 anti-aircraft guns and four barrelled ZSU-4 heavy machine guns. The Bofors guns can be operated either manually or electrically and they can be laid on their targets either visually or through radar. The 14.5mm machine guns can only be operated manually but they provide a high rate of fire. Air defence posed particular problems because of the passage of time on the Bofors guns, built in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 Regiment Maltese Infantry|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/mt-afm-infantry.htm|website=Global Security|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El-Abnoudy is considered to be one of the pioneer Arab female movie directors as her films have inspired the works of many Arab women in the industry. She has been nicknamed the "poor people's filmmaker" due to the subject matter that inspired her to make films: civil rights issues and the unfortunate living circumstances of impoverished Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valassopoulos|first=Anastasia|date=2013-09-13|title=Arab Cultural Studies|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315873206|journal=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=en|doi=10.4324/9781315873206}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ateyyat El Abnoudy has been the recipient of many awards for her films. Her film, ''Horse of Mud (1971)'' won her three international prizes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1972, Abnoudy also won the French Critics Prize at Grenoble Film Festival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; El-Abnoudy was one of the earliest Arab women filmmakers to have been working in Egypt, and led the way for many other film-making Arab women to pursue a career in the industry. 

==Early Life and Education==
Ateyyat El Abnoudy began her early life being raised in a small village by her two parents in a working class family. El-Abnoudy attended the [[Cairo University|University of Cairo]] where she began working at a theatre and as an actress to put herself through school and to attain her law degree. This is where she met her first husband, a journalist and poet named [[Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi|Abdel-Rahman El Abnoudy]]. Because of Abdel's career, Atteyyat was in the arts circle which meant networking with many writers, poets, and the artistic types of Egypt. She gives thanks to one of the people who helped her in her journey Nasser, his coming into power allowed for the filmmaker to attend post-secondary and take further steps to beginning her career.

While deciding on where she fits in the film world, Ateyyat worked in many different roles in the theater, such as stage manager and assistant. When she found her passion in film-making she decided to continue her education. In 1972 she attended Cairo’s Higher Film Institute to finish her film studies. In the two years she spent there, she created her first two films called ''Horse of Mud'', which she received awards for.  At the time that film was created to filmmaker was still new to the industry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

While Abnoudy was nearing her graduation date she was also in the process of creating her first documentary ''Horse of Mud'' &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van de Peer|first=Stefanie|date=January 2011|title=ThePhysicalities ofDocumentaries byAfricanWomen|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19301944.2011.10781405|journal=Critical Interventions|volume=5|issue=1|pages=135–153|doi=10.1080/19301944.2011.10781405|issn=1930-1944|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Abnoudy stated that she wanted to have what she referred to as a style of poetic realism. The ways in which she captured the images of her actresses was a way she states would show that the best. According to Van de Peer, the ''Horse of Mud'' wasn’t only Abnoudy’s first documentary, but it was also Egypt’s first documentary by a woman.

Abnoudy worked on creating original work. Work that circulates are the lives that people in third world countries are living in as Van de peer states in his piece. She likes to focus on the things in our everyday lives that influence us. The impacts that society has on our lives. In terms of a poetic approach, a few of her movies are short films. Like the saying: a little says a lot, that is the way in which Abnoudy’s films speak to her viewers. She wants her audience to understand the message she is using her films to relay. Every time her films are watched she wants the viewer to learn her message and relate to the film in a new way each time&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

At the time that Abnoudy was in the process of sculpting her craft, according to Van de Peer in his articles, Egypt was undermining the freedom of expression, especially of women. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Van de Peer states that the feminist documentary writer expresses her poetic realism, along with that Abnoudy uses her films ''Permissible Dreams'' (1982) and ''Responsible Women'' (1994) to make her viewers feel empathy and appropriation.

&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;The interest that she had in law, her work as an actress, and the circle of people she surrounded herself with inspired her to become a filmmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=notjDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Permissible+Dissidence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtndWrtf3dAhVRjlkKHUgPADkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ateyyat&amp;f=false|title=Negotiating Dissidence: The Pioneering Women of Arab Documentary|last=Peer|first=Stefanie Van de|date=2017-03-08|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748696079|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ateyyat El Abnoudy started her acting career as a means to financially support herself in school while she studied journalism. When El-Abnoudy's career as a journalist began, she took a particular interest in the poor people of Egypt, specifically [[Cairo]]. This later inspired her to take up production and become a filmmaker who shined a light on some of the unfortunate life circumstances of those in Egypt. El-Abnoudy quickly became known by two titles: the "poor people's filmmaker" and the "mother of documentaries" as she inspired many Arab women filmmakers to follow in her footsteps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peer|first=Stefanie Van de|date=2017-04-01|title=Ateyyat El Abnoudy: Poetic Realism in Egyptian Documentaries|url=http://edinburgh.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.3366/edinburgh/9780748696062.001.0001/upso-9780748696062-chapter-002|language=en-US|doi=10.3366/edinburgh/9780748696062.001.0001/upso-9780748696062-chapter-002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

El-Abnoudy started making films since 1971, most of which are known for dealing with political, social, and economic issues in Egypt. During the time she began making films Egypt had just overcome a long and complex colonial history with Britain. The film industry in Egypt was known for being very cultural and state endorsed, specifically to promote Arab filmmakers and censor what was being published in the country. Ateyyat El Abnoudy saw this as a challenge and, as one of the first female filmmakers, she directed her first documentary called ''Horse of Mud'' in ''1971.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19301944.2011.10781405|title=The Physicalities of Documentaries by African Women|last=|first=|date=|website=Taylor &amp; Francis Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; El-Abnoudy further contested the censorship of Egypt filmmakers when she became the first female to establish her own production company, Abnoud Film, supporting small filmmakers similar to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=yv1BH5Wz-ekC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Ateyyat+El+Abnoudy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o-swHoo0HB&amp;sig=_mMiXrzGpKQW1ihoeanE0sApHNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjR9oH1t7veAhXzrIMKHZwyAWoQ6AEwBHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ateyyat%20El%20Abnoudy&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Arab Women Filmmakers|last=Hillauer|first=Rebecca|date=2005|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=9789774249433|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Her first film, ''Horse of Mud (1971),'' is considered to capture the dignity of Cairo's poorest peoples. This film follows the process of brick-making, a repetitive, painful, yet necessary task. ''Horse of Mud,'' illuminates the struggles of surviving in Cairo as an impoverished person by intertwining brick-makers personal stories to the work they do to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=2C2wzBbTzfQC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Horse+of+Mud+El-Abnoudy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqtuiP5rveAhVMqlkKHVyqBCAQ6AEIPjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Horse%20of%20Mud%20El-Abnoudy&amp;f=false|title=French-speaking Women Documentarians: A Guide|last=Pallister|first=Janis L.|last2=Hottell|first2=Ruth A.|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9780820476148|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''B'nai Brith Canada''' (BBC) ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|b|ə|ˌ|n|eɪ|_|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|θ}}, from {{lang-he-n|בני ברית}} ''b'né brit'', "Children of the [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenant]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Judaism |page=61 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2006|author=Sara E. Karesh, Mitchell M. Hurvitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the Canadian section of [[B'nai B'rith]] (the Canadian organization uses no apostrophe in "B'rith"), the oldest [[Judaism|Jewish]] service organization in the world. It is committed to the security and continuity of the [[Jews|Jewish people]] and the State of [[Israel]] and combating [[antisemitism]] and bigotry.

==Mission==
The Mission of B'nai Brith Canada, as stated in the preamble to its constitution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;B'nai Brith has taken upon itself the mission of uniting person of the Jewish faith in the work of promoting their highest interest and those of humanity; of developing and elevating the mental and moral character of the people of our faith; of inculcating the purest principles of philanthropy, honour and patriotism; of supporting science and art; alleviating the wants of the poor and needy; visiting and caring for the sick; coming to the rescue of the victims of persecution; providing for, protecting and assisting the aged, the widow and the orphan on the broadest principles of humanity.&lt;ref name="Selick 1964 118"&gt;{{cite book|last=Selick|first=Abel|title=History of B'nai B'rith in Eastern Canada|year=1964|publisher=Apex Press Limited|location=Montreal|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early history==

B'nai Brith Canada has had a presence in this country since its earliest days, with roots stretching back to 1875. It is Canadian Jewry's most senior human rights advocacy organization and is the only national independent voice speaking out on behalf of grassroots Jewish Canadians.

In 1875, Lodge No. 246 was the first lodge founded in [[Toronto]] [[Canada]], followed soon after by another in [[Montreal]]. Many community leaders were associated with these lodges. Over time, a team of dedicated volunteers and professional staff engaged in combating antisemitism, bigotry and racism in Canada and abroad in addition to wide-ranging educational and social programming, community and volunteer services, and human initiatives. These and other activities undertaken are meant to reflect the organization's commitment to "People Helping People."&lt;ref name="Selick 1964 118"/&gt;

Just as B'nai Brith has grown and evolved over the years in order to respond to the particular needs of the time, so has Canadian Jewry undergone many transformations. Throughout, B'nai Brith has consistently employed its successful advocacy model of strong community, results-oriented grassroots activism.

==20th century to present==

In the first two decades of the 20th century B'nai B'rith launched three of today's major Jewish organizations: The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life|Hillel]] and [[BBYO]] (originally B'nai B'rith Youth Organization). Later they would take on a life of their own with varying degrees of autonomy.

In January 2004, Shahina Siddiqui, executive director of the Islamic Social Services Association, filed a formal complaint against B'nai Brith Canada under the "discriminatory signs and statements" section of the Manitoba Human Rights Code. After speaking with several people who attended a Winnipeg conference on terrorism hosted by B'nai Brith Canada in October 2003, she wrote that the event was biased against Muslims and would encourage the response teams in attendance to engage in racial profiling. The Manitoba Human Rights Commission (MHRC) accepted the complaint and began an investigation that would last five years. In 2009, the MHRC issued a report that dismissed the complaint due to a lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=nobasis&gt;[http://databank.isranet.org/article.asp?article=46966 'No basis' for B'nai Brith hate charge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103124651/http://databank.isranet.org/article.asp?article=46966 |date=2014-01-03 }} by Joseph Brean, National Post, March 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; MHRC vice-chairwoman Yvonne Peters subsequently wrote that "the full investigation of the complaint that took place was warranted" and that "the decision was based solely on the insufficiency of the evidence with respect to this particular section of the Human Rights Code."&lt;ref name=nobasis/&gt;&lt;ref name=accused&gt;[https://nationalpost.com/related/links/story.html?id=755930 B'nai Brith accused of hate speech] by Joseph Brean, August 29, 2008.{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2008, [[David Matas]], B'nai Brith's senior counsel, sharply criticized the MHRC for its conduct during the investigation, stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [Manitoba] Human Rights Commission itself is supposed to be promoting human rights, but in our view in this process it's violating some pretty basic rights: a secret proceeding, a faceless accuser, failure to disclose documents. These are basic procedural rights that are being violated.&lt;ref name=accused/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing in the ''[[National Post]]'', Joseph Brean made several criticisms of the investigation:
*The MHRC accepted the complaint despite the fact that the complainant, Shahina Siddiqui, did not actually attend the event.
*B'nai Brith Canada was never told of the identity of the individuals whose claims Shahina Siddiqui based her complaint on.
*It has never been revealed what exactly is alleged to have been said at the conference.
*MHRC investigator, Tracy Lloyd, spoke with seven anonymous witnesses, including one as late as November 2006. However, only one, a city of Winnipeg employee, shared Siddiqui's criticism that the conference was "one-sided." One of the witnesses, a diversity relations officer, stated that it was "pretty professional," and said police in general are capable of putting almost anything they hear into proper context.
*The MHRC commissioned a "secret expert report" but refused B'nai Brith's request to know the expert's identity, mandate or material provided. The secret report has still not been made public.&lt;ref name=nobasis/&gt;&lt;ref name=accused/&gt;

Following the release of the MHRC report, Matas accused MHRC vice-chairwoman Yvonne Peters of taking a contradictory position, stating that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;So what they're saying is that a full investigation is warranted even when there's no evidence, as long as the accusation is within the jurisdiction of the board. There's a lot of problems with this. What basically happened is that Siddiqui heard a rumour. She makes a complaint, as a result of which the commission goes on a five-year [[fishing expedition]]. They don't find anything. We're co-operating with them. And then they dismiss the complaint. That's not a proper procedure, in my view.&lt;ref name=nobasis/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Matas also criticized the procedures of the MHRC, stating that they will "take an allegation, without evidence, and just run with it to see if it's true." The previous year, Matas in a submission in a Moon Report on Internet hate speech, Matas charged that Canada's human rights commissions have demonstrated "a disastrous combination of investigative zeal and substantive ignorance." Although Matas stated that he does not believe Siddiqui acted in bad faith, he added that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The people who run these procedures have to have a more objective viewpoint than the people who make the complaint.&lt;ref name=nobasis/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 2009, B'nai Brith Canada issued a press release&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnaibrith.ca/prdisplay.php?id=1520 B’nai Brith Canada raises the alarm over Carleton’s reinstatement of alleged synagogue bomber (Canada)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702041407/http://www.bnaibrith.ca/prdisplay.php?id=1520 |date=2012-07-02 }}, B'nai Brith Canada. July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; denouncing [[Carleton University]] for hiring [[Hassan Diab]], who was alleged by French authorities to have been responsible for the [[1980 Paris synagogue bombing]]. Diab was living under virtual house arrest at the time (he had been granted bail but under very strict conditions) due to an extradition request from France. Diab, who has denied any involvement with the synagogue bombing, has not been convicted of any crime. Within a few hours of the B'nai Brith Canada complaint, Carleton University announced that it would "immediately replace the current instructor, Hassan Diab" in order to provide students "with a stable, productive academic environment that is conducive to learning." B'nai Brith executive vice-president Frank Dimant later stated that "the university did the right thing."&lt;ref&gt;[https://edmontonjournal.com/news/Brith+complaint+preceded+university+withdrawal/1838268/story.html B’nai Brith complaint preceded university’s job withdrawal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823010727/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Brith+complaint+preceded+university+withdrawal/1838268/story.html |date=2009-08-23 }}, ''Edmonton Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2009, B'nai Brith Canada ran a full page ad in the ''National Post'' comparing radical Islam with [[Nazi]]sm. [[Frank Dimant]], CEO of B'nai Brith, said "overall, feedback from the ad has been very positive."  At the same time, the ad drew the ire of the group Canadian Jewish Holocaust Survivors and the Canadian Association of Jews and Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2009/11/12/1009147/bnai-brith-ad-raises-survivors-ire "B’nai Brith ad raises survivors’ ire"], ''[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]'', November 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Ontario lawyer Michael Mostyn was appointed CEO of B'nai Brith Canada, succeeding [[Frank Dimant]] upon his retirement after 36 years with the organization. In 2015, the organization indefinitely suspended publication of ''Jewish Tribune'' and announced the sale of its heavily mortgaged headquarters at 15 Hove Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=B'nai Brith Canada to sell its national HQ |url=http://www.cjnews.com/canada/bnai-brith-canada-sell-its-national-hq |accessdate=June 30, 2015 |work=Canadian Jewish News |date=June 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701085855/http://www.cjnews.com/canada/bnai-brith-canada-sell-its-national-hq |archivedate=July 1, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance and financial issues===
In 2007, a group calling itself Concerned Members of B'nai Brith Canada charged that a new constitution had been passed despite a majority of members having voted against it at a general meeting.  Henry Gimpel, a former Toronto lodge president, told ''[[The Forward]]'' that "[t]here's too much of [B'nai Brith Canada] being run by one person."&lt;ref name=Forward&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Sheldon|title=B'nai Brith Canada Faces Revolt|url=http://forward.com/news/12003/b-nai-brith-canada-faces-revolt-00771/|accessdate=July 10, 2015|work=Forward|date=November 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Dimant, CEO of BBC, responded to the criticism over the constitution by saying that BBC followed proper governance procedures and that B'nai Brith International's Court of Appeal determined that the constitution was properly enacted.  Gimpel and seven other BBC members were expelled in June 2008 for what a disciplinary committee determined to be "conduct unbecoming a member." Gimpel referred to the committee as a [[kangaroo court]].&lt;ref name="cjnews.com"&gt;[http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14190&amp;Itemid=86 Paul Lungen, "B’nai Brith expels members for ‘conduct unbecoming’"], ''Canadian Jewish News''&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2015, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported that Dimant has demanded an annual retirement payout of $175,000, representing 75% of his former salary, which the B'nai Brith believes is too lucrative and will require the struggling charity to direct  fundraising dollars to pay for Dimant's pension. Dimant has stated that the payout was approved by the organization's board, however, the ''Star'' cites an unnamed source as stating that the deal was arranged with little oversight while Dimant was still in charge. In the year following Dimant's retirement, B'nai Brith Canada put its "state of the art" care facility for [[Alzheimer's]] patients under insolvency protection while also trying to sell it. The project,  initiated and led by Dimant, is a $16 million facility opened in 2013 but that been unable to attract enough patients, due to high fees for patients of $7,500 a month and the fact that it was not designed to be wheelchair accessible; the facility is losing $50,000 a month and owes $11 million to creditors.&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/07/08/state-of-the-art-alzheimers-facility-in-toronto-lacks-money-patients.html|title=State of the art Alzheimer's facility in Toronto lacks money, patients|last=Donovan|first=Kevin|date=8 July 2015|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Toronto Star'' article also claimed that other issues left by Dimant's former management of B'nai Brith are a lack of records and record keeping and failure to always issue charitable tax receipts and poor corporate governance with approximately 50 people who had believed they were on various boards of B'nai Brith organizations learning that this is not the case, as Dimant's management had failed to file the correct paperwork with government agencies.&lt;ref name="Donovan"/&gt;

Due to financial difficulties, including a decline in charitable donations in recent years, B'nai Brith also ceased publication of its newspaper, ''[[The Jewish Tribune (Canada)|Jewish Tribune]]'' in 2015, and is selling its headquarters which carries two mortgages totalling nearly $4 million, though the building itself is assessed at slightly over $3 million.&lt;ref name=forwardfrank&gt;{{cite news|title=B'nai B'rith Canada Plans To Sell Headquarters|url=http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/311697/bnai-brith-canada-plans-to-sell-headquarters/|accessdate=July 10, 2015|work=Forward|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported by ''The Forward'' in 2007 that the organization was struggling financially and mortgaged its head office in order to raise $850,000 to meet expenses.&lt;ref name = Forward/&gt;

==Initiatives==

===Hezbollah terror designation===
On November 29, 2002, B'nai Brith Canada sued the Canadian government for "failing to crack down on the fundraising efforts of [[Hezbollah]]", by not adding Hezbollah's charity wing to the list of banned terrorist organizations; the military wing of Hezbollah was already listed, but not the entire organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1038831792871_2 B'nai Brith Sues Canadian Government Over Hezbollah], ''CTV News''&lt;/ref&gt;  About a week later, Canada made the decision to designate all of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.meforum.org/meib/articles/0301_l3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Hate Hotline===
B'nai Brith Canada operates a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week 'Anti-Hate Hotline'. The hotline receives calls from those who feel they have suffered from antisemitism or discrimination and is one of the sources of the organisation's statistics for its [http://www.bnaibrith.ca/audit2016 Annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents.]

===Investigations of Antisemitism in the Media===
B'nai Brith Canada has a notable track-record in uncovering instances of hate speech and antisemitism in the media. In February 2016, B'nai Brith exposed the Windsor, Ontario newspaper 'al Forqan' for calling terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians as "sacred duty of JIhad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.torontosun.com/2017/02/17/time-to-get-serious-about-anti-semitism&lt;/ref&gt;" In July 2016, B'nai Brith Canada, together with the [[London Police Service]]s, exposed 'al-Saraha,' a London, Ontario newspaper for denying the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bnaibrith.ca/2016_b_nai_brith_canada_s_year_in_review&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union ''' or the '''Hramada''' ({{lang-be|Беларуская Сялянска-Работніцкая Грамада}} ([[Lacinka]]: ''Biełaruskaja Sialanska-Rabotnickaja Hramada''), {{lang-pl|Białoruska Włościańsko-Robotnicza Hromada}} was a socialist agrarian political party created in 1925 by a group of [[Sejm#Sejm of the Second Polish Republic|Belarusian deputies to the Sejm]] of the [[Second Polish Republic]] that included [[Branislaw Tarashkyevich]], Symon Rak-Michajłoŭski ''[[:be:Сымон Рак-Міхайлоўскі|(be)]]'', Piotra Miatła ''[[:be:Пётра Мятла|(be)]]'', and the founder of ''Hramada'' Pavieł Vałošyn ''[[:be:Павел Пятровіч Валошын|(be)]]''.&lt;ref name="kresy24.pl"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://kresy24.pl/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Glos_znad_Niemna_7-2011.pdf |title=Białostocki ulubieniec Stalina |trans-title=Stalin's protégé from Białystok |journal=Głos znad Niemna |publisher=Ogólnokrajowy tygodnik SZ «Związek Polaków na Białorusi» (Association of Poles in Belarus) |year=2011 |number=7 (60) |accessdate=24 May 2014 |author=Andrzej Poczobut |author2=Joanna Klimowicz |via=PDF file, direct download 1.79 MB |pages=6&amp;ndash;7 of current document}}{{vn|date=August 2016}} ''[no source of data provided]'' &lt;!-- Kresy24 is a Polish nationalist irredentist website that cannot be seen as a reliable source --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The group received logistical help from the Soviet Union,&lt;ref name="kresy24.pl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AnS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuferak"/&gt; and financial aid from the Comintern.&lt;ref name="Kuferak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Savchenko"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oce"/&gt;

==Ideology==
The main points of BPWU's program were:&lt;ref name=150pytanniau/&gt; the democratic self-governance for [[West Belarus]] within Poland, introduction of an eight-hour [[working day]], the recognition of the [[Belarusian language]] in Poland as a second official language, the cancellation of the "colonization of Belarus" by the Polish [[Osadnik]]s, and the free distribution to peasants of land owned by landlords upon its confiscation. There was also a semi-official goal to unite all of Belarusians of [[West Belarus]] and [[East Belarus]] within one Soviet state,&lt;ref name=150pytanniau/&gt; which in all practicality, was an act of treason against Poland.&lt;ref name="Oce"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Journal of Belarusian Studies |author=Dorota Michaluk |author2=Per Rudling |author2-link=Per Anders Rudling |year=2014 |publisher=Ostrogorski Centre |ISBN=1291893253 |page=27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aOtDCwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Mironowicz+Russophiles |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Flag_of_Belarus_(1918,_1991-1995).svg|thumb|200px|right|The Belarusian national flag as used by the Hramada and other Belarusian organizations in interwar Poland.]]

''Hramada'' was formed legally in July 1925.&lt;ref name="kresy24.pl"/&gt; Its leaders were among prominent members of the Belarusian national liberation movement of the early 20th century: Symon Rak-Michajloŭski has previously been a high-ranking diplomat for the [[Belarusian Democratic Republic]], Branisłaŭ Taraškievič is known as the creator of the first modern Belarusian grammar.

The Polish authorities began to suppress the activities of the Hramada in late 1926 due to its policy coordination with the delegalized [[Communist Party of Western Belarus]].&lt;ref name=150pytanniau/&gt; Belarusian media in Poland faced increased pressure and censorship from the authorities.&lt;ref name=karenieuskaja&gt;{{cite journal |author=Кореневская, О. |url=http://pdf.kamunikat.org/download.php?item=2190-5.pdf |title=Особенности Западнобелорусского возрождения (на примере периодической печати) |pages=69–89 |journal=Białoruskie Zeszyty Historyczne |number=20 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership and structure==
[[File:Br.Tarashkevich.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Branisłaŭ Taraškievič, one of the leaders of the BPWU]]
Membership numbers of the Hramada grew on a very fast pace with sometimes entire Belarusian villages becoming members.&lt;ref name="kresy24.pl"/&gt; By November 1926 the party has enrolled 120,000 members, which is believed to be the largest political party in Belarusian history today,&lt;ref name=150pytanniau/&gt; and one of the largest revolutionary-democratic organizations of its time.&lt;ref name=karenieuskaja/&gt;

The ''Hramada'' had party cells in the following [[powiat]]s of the [[Nowogródek Voivodeship (1919–39)|Nowogródek Voivodeship]] in Second Polish Republic: [[Baranovichi]] (Baranowicze), [[Bielsk Podlaski|Bielsk]], [[Valozhyn]] (Wołożyn), [[Vawkavysk]] (Wołkowysk), [[Vileyka]] (Wilejka), [[Vilnius|Wilno]], [[Grodno]], [[Dzisna]], [[Kosava, Belarus|Kosava]], [[Lida]], [[Maladzyechna]], [[Navahrudak]], [[Pastavy]], [[Pinsk]], [[Slonim]], [[Stouptsy]] and [[Sokółka]].&lt;ref name="Kuferak"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kuferak.iatp.by/text11.htm|author=Васіль Гарбачэўскі |title=ЗНІТАВАНЫЯ ЛЁСАМ |work=Куфэрак Віленшчыны |date=September 2, 2002 |language=be |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030712041604/http://kuferak.iatp.by/text11.htm|archivedate=12 July 2003 |quote="Магчыма, што ў Косаве не дайшло б да расстрэлу мірнай дэманстрацыі, каб не “памаглі” камуністы...

The Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union ''Hramada'' established several periodicals devoted not only to politics, but also to culture and business, including ''Zyccio bielarusa'', ''Bielaruskaja niva'', ''Bielaruskaja sprava'', ''Narodnaja sprava'', and ''Nasa sprava''. The total circulation of publications of the Hramada in early 1927 was above 10,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Kuferak"/&gt;&lt;ref name=karenieuskaja/&gt;

==Radicalization and dissolution==
The Belarusian national movement in [[West Belarus]] (called [[Kresy]] [[macroregion]] in interwar Poland) grew more loyal to the Soviet regime and its communist ideology as the years went on. The Soviets also gained increasingly more control over the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union, and gave the Belarusian national liberation movement in Poland a communist context.&lt;ref name=150pytanniau/&gt; According to Polish sources in Belarus,&lt;ref name="kresy24.pl"/&gt; the Hramada received not only logistical, but also physical help from the Soviet Union,&lt;ref name="kresy24.pl"/&gt; and financial aid from the Comintern.&lt;ref name="Savchenko"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmld75blKCwC&amp;q=%22stated+goals+of+the+Hramada%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22stated%20goals%20of%20the%20Hramada%22&amp;f=false |title=Belarus: A Perpetual Borderland |publisher=BRILL |author=Dr Andrew Savchenko |year=2009 |pages=106&amp;ndash;107 |isbn=9004174486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection between ''Hramada'' and the delegalized Communist Party of Western Belarus aided by Moscow was inevitably discovered by the Polish authorities.&lt;ref name="kresy24.pl"/&gt; On 15 January 1927 some top activists of ''Hramada'' were arrested under the charge of subversive anti-Polish activities. The trial of the leaders of ''Hramada'' became known as the ''Trial of the Fifty Six'' ({{lang-be|Працэс 56-ці}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pawet.net/library/history/bel_history/paskevich/17/%D0%A1%D1%8B%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BD_%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%BA-%D0%9C%D1%96%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%9E%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%96:_%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%96_%D0%B6%D1%8B%D1%86%D1%86%D1%8F_%D1%96_%D0%B4%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%86%D1%96.html Алесь Пашкевіч. Сымон Рак-Міхайлоўскі: старонкі жыцця і дзейнасці.] (Alieś Paškievič, Symon Rak-Michajloŭski: staronki žyccia i dziejnasci.)&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders including [[Branisłaŭ Taraškievič]], Symon Rak-Michajłoŭski, Piotra Miatła, and Pavieł Vałošyn, were each sentenced to 12 years in prison. The Polish authorities handed them over to the Soviets in 1930 (Rak-Michajłoŭski, Vałošyn, Miatła) and 1933 (Taraškievič) in exchange for political prisoners held in the USSR (including the West Belarusian journalist and playwright [[Francišak Alachnovič]]). A few years later, all four former leaders of the ''Hramada'' were either executed by the Soviet regime as "Polish spies" or sent to perish in the [[GULAG]].&lt;ref name=150pytanniau/&gt;

In the aftermath of the party's de-legalisation, on February 3, 1927 a riot erupted in [[Kosava, Belarus|Kosava]] where the Soviet ''diversionist'' cell was already formed by Moscow with all required help.&lt;ref name="Kuferak"/&gt; Polish police responded to attacks with fire, killing 6 people and wounding several dozens.&lt;ref name="Kuferak"/&gt;

==Historical role, legacy and criticism==
According to historian Andrew Savchenko, by 1927 the ''Hramada'' organization was controlled entirely by agents deployed from Moscow, whose aim was to destabilize the region and recruit partisans.&lt;ref name="Savchenko"/&gt; According to Polish media, the Hramada turned into a cover for infiltration of Poland by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="kresy24.pl"/&gt; According to Savchenko, BPWU only theoretically demanded independence for Belarus, but in practice promoted only the idea of incorporating the ethnically Belarusian lands into the Soviet Union which meant yet another partition of Poland.&lt;ref name="Savchenko"/&gt; The Russian agents attempted to isolate the Belarusian ethnic minority in Poland from the political process in the country.&lt;ref name="AnS"/&gt; In turn, ''Hramada'' leaders did exactly what their Moscow advisers suggested they do, and disseminated Comintern propaganda,&lt;ref name="AnS"&gt;{{cite book |title=Belarus - A Perpetual Borderland |author=Andrew Savchenko |publisher=BRILL |year=2009 |ISBN=9047427947 |page=106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ESGwCQAAQBAJ&amp;q=Comintern+Hramada |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the rapid growth of its rank and file. By March 1927 the party had 120,000 members.&lt;ref name="Kuferak"/&gt; The membership of the Communist Party decreased at the same time by a thousand.&lt;ref name="Savchenko"/&gt;

In Belarus, the BPWU is viewed positively by both the official regime and the opposition. It is seen as a mass democratic party that emerged in [[West Belarus]] as a response to harsh ethnic discrimination of the Belarusians in mid-war Poland. It is being pointed out that the Hramada was persecuted by both the Polish regime and by the Stalinist USSR.&lt;ref name=150pytanniau/&gt;

'''Building the Education Revolution''' ('''BER''') is an [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] program administered by the [[Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations]] (DEEWR) designed to provide new and refurbished infrastructure to all eligible Australian schools.&lt;ref name="DEEWR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deewr.gov.au/Schooling/BuildingTheEducationRevolution/Pages/default.aspx |title=Building the Education Revolution |work=Nation Building: Economic Stimulus Plan |publisher=Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations |accessdate=16 April 2010 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417041604/http://www.deewr.gov.au/schooling/buildingtheeducationrevolution/Pages/default.aspx |archive-date=17 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was part of the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd government]]'s [[economic stimulus]] package designed as a response to the [[Late-2000s recession in Australasia|2007–2010 global financial crisis]].

The program, totalling A$16.2&amp;nbsp;billion has three elements:&lt;ref name="DEEWR" /&gt;
*Primary Schools for the 21st Century ($14.2b): providing new and refurbished halls, libraries and classrooms
*Science and Language Centres for 21st Century Secondary Schools ($821.8m): providing new and refurbished science laboratories and language learning centres
*National School Pride program ($1.28b): providing new and refurbished covered outdoor learning areas, shade structures, sporting facilities and other environmental programs.

The program has attracted attention from critics of the government for alleged "[[wikt:rort|rorting]]" (misappropriation of public funds) and for not delivering value-for-money outcomes. Instances of inflated quotes or new buildings that were not particularly useful to the school were reported.  The [[Leader of the Opposition]] [[Tony Abbott]] called for a judicial inquiry into the BER and the [[Energy Efficient Homes Package|Home Insulation Program]], described by the opposition [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] as  "failed programs" and a "waste of public money".&lt;ref name="Abbott"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/abbott-demands-schools-batts-inquiry-20100405-rmqh.html|title=Abbott Demands Schools Batts Inquiry|date=5 April 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=16 April 2010|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2010, the government announced the formation of the BER Implementation Taskforce "to ensure projects are providing value for money". Gillard defended the BER saying that it was "already one of the most heavily scrutinised programs in the nation's history" and that the program was the "centerpiece" of an economic stimulus package that helped to "ensure that a generation of Australians weren't consigned to months or years of joblessness".&lt;ref name="Gillard"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/new-taskforce-an-extra-check-on-schools-spending/story-e6frg6zo-1225852928045|title=New taskforce an extra check on spending |last=Gillard|first=Julia|date=13 April 2010|work=The Australian|accessdate=16 April 2010|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2010 election BER moved under the portfolio of Senator [[Chris Evans (Australian politician)|Chris Evans]]. 

The Taskforce, headed by Brad Orgill, former chairman and chief executive of UBS Australasia, delivered its report to Senator Evans on 15 December 2010. The report found that most of BER projects had been successfully delivered, with only 3% of the schools involved in the program making complaints. Projects in NSW received the most complaints. The third and final report by Brad Orgill found that BER projects in NSW, QLD and VIC overpaid for buildings by more than 25% on average compared to Catholic schools and more than 55% compared to Independent schools.&lt;ref name="Orgill"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/ber-waste-tops-15b/story-fn59niix-1226090622303|title=BER waste tops $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion|date=8 July 2011|work=The Australian|accessdate=8 July 2011|location=Brisbane|first=Anthony|last=Klan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian National Audit Office|ANAO]] investigation into the project ruled that comparison with those projects were not valid as the standards applied to government school facilities were higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keane|first=Bernard|title=Read all about it: the BER program worked, and worked well|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2010/05/05/read-all-about-it-the-ber-program-worked-and-worked-well/|accessdate=23 June 2013|newspaper=Crikey|date=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building the Education Revolution – Primary Schools for the 21st Century|url=http://www.anao.gov.au/Publications/Audit-Reports/2009-2010/Building-the-Education-Revolution---Primary-Schools-for-the-21st-Century|publisher=Australian National Audit Office|accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] commented in August 2010 that the government's stimulus package, including the BER, was well-designed by world standards and that some waste was inevitable.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/06/2975865.htm|title=Stimulus 'served Australia well' despite waste|date=10 August 2010|work=ABC news|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 2014 three Australian academics published a paper in the ''International Journal of Public Administration'' that
argued that the BER program represents a "'case study' of how governments should not pursue large-scale public expenditure programs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building the Education Revolution: Another Case of Australian Government Failure?|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01900692.2013.836660|date=25 March 2014|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper says that the BER illustrates the pitfalls of large-scale public expenditure programs, and that it did not provide value for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/labors-ber-reforms-a-case-study-of-failure/story-fn59nlz9-1226870368714#|title=Labor's BER reforms "a case study of failure" |date=1 April 2014|work=The Australian|accessdate=1 April 2014|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:2013-08-05 Adenauerallee 81-83, Bonn- Bundesrechnungshof IMG 0515.jpg|thumb|300px|Seat of the Federal Court of Auditors in Bonn]]
The '''Bundesrechnungshof''' (Federal Court of Auditors; also Federal Audit Office) is the supreme federal authority for federal [[audit]] matters in [[Germany]]. There are equivalent bodies at [[States of Germany|state]] level. The status of the Bundesrechnungshof, its members and its essential functions are guaranteed by the German Constitution ([http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P114 art. 114 paragraph 2] of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]]), and regulated by other legislation (i.e. Bundesrechnungshof Act, Federal Budget Code). It is an independent judicial body, with around 600 employees. Its current President is [[Kay Scheller]].

The institution is a supreme federal authority only as far as it administers internal tasks such as personnel affairs, management of buildings or clearance of travel expenses and the like.
Processing its core duties - auditing, reporting and counseling as external financial controllers - it is not part of the executive branch of Germany, but is positioned beyond the three classical constitutional powers.
The Bundesrechnungshof is not subordinated to the federal government.
Even the legislative (parliament) cannot instruct it. At best, the parliament can ask the authority to audit certain issues.
From the third power, justice, it differs firstly by freely choosing the subject matters it intends to audit and secondly by not delivering legally binding rules, but by issuing recommendations.
Bundesrechnungshof’s exact placement within a classical system of the division of powers is disputed.

== Role ==

The Bundesrechnungshof examines the financial management of the federal government, its various property funds and state-owned companies, carrying out sample audits of revenue and expenditure totalling over 500 billion Euros. Its audit mandate also covers [[social security]] institutions and the activities of the federal government in private-law enterprises of which it is a shareholder. This includes areas such as defence, roadworks, taxation, and the federal government's activity as a minority shareholder of the formerly nationalised railways, post, and phone companies ([[Deutsche Bahn]] AG, [[Deutsche Post]] AG and [[Deutsche Telekom]] AG respectively).

The Bundesrechnungshof makes recommendations on the basis of its audit experience and provides advice to the audited bodies, to the German Parliament and the Federal Government. Its consulting activities have steadily increased and set out significant recommendations for quality improvement, pointing out the potential for savings or increases in revenue.

The Bundesrechnungshof reports on its audit findings in management letters which are sent to the audited bodies for comment. In addition the Bundesrechnungshof submits an annual report ("Observations") to both Houses of the German Parliament, the [[Bundestag]] and the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]], as well as to the Federal Government. The annual report is also used as a basis for Parliament authorising the Federal Government's budget. The annual report is presented to the public at a federal press conference. The Bundesrechnungshof may at any time submit special reports on matters of major significance to both Houses of Parliament, and to the Federal Government.

The Bundesrechnungshof provides advice to the executive and legislative branches by including recommendations for improvement in its management letters and annual reports, as well as by commenting - orally or in writing - on topical issues such as government bills and major procurement projects, or in the course of the annual budget procedure.

By virtue of legislation regarding [[German reunification]], the Bundesrechnungshof's new headquarters were transferred from [[Frankfurt am Main]] to [[Bonn]], effective 1 July 2000. The Bundesrechnungshof also has a branch office in [[Potsdam]].

== History ==
The first precursor of that auditory branch in Germany is the Prussian Audit Office. Its name as "{{lang|de|Rechnungskammer}}" comes from the medivial concept of a [[Court of Auditors (France)|Chambres des Comptes]] overseeing the spending of the state. In medieval times it did have regulatory functions which it did loose to various administrative offices, so much that only reporting functions were left. The installation of a high office is influenced by the mismanagement of the [[Cabinet of Three Counts]] in Prussia (1702-1710).

The "{{lang|de|Preußische Oberrechnungskammer}}" (Prussian High Audit Office) was founded in 1714 by King [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] as the "{{lang|de|General-Rechen-Kammer}}" (General Audit Office), given more powers in 1723 becoming the "{{lang|de|Ober-Kriegs- und Domänen-Rechenkammer}}" (High War and Domains Audit Office).&lt;ref&gt;Albert Manke: [http://www.schouwer-online.de/dokumente/1935_Manke-Entwicklung_Pruefungsdienst.pdf ''Die Entwicklung des Prüfungsdienstes bei der Preussischen Oberrechnungskammer und dem Rechnungshof des Deutschen Reichs''] (PDF; 180 kB) Vortrag, gehalten am 18. Dezember 1935. Auf der Webseite von H. Schouwer, aufgerufen am 4. Februar 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This office did exist until 1945. It is the basis of the "{{lang|de|Rechnungshof des Norddeutschen Bundes}}" (Court of Auditors of the North German Confederation) founded in 1868, which was soon to be come the "{{lang|de|Rechnungshof des Deutschen Reiches}}" (Court of Auditors of the German Reich) in 1871. It was reestablished in 1948 as the "{{lang|de|Rechnungshof im Vereinigten Wirtschaftsgebiet}}" (Court of Auditors of the United Economic Area), and with the foundation of the West-German Federal Republic it became the "{{lang|de|Bundesrechnungshof}}" (Federal Court of Auditors).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesrechnungshof.de/de/bundesrechnungshof/geschichte www.bundesrechnungshof.de] Geschichte. Aufgerufen am 4. Februar 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the Bundesrechnungshof hosted XIII [[International Congress of Supreme Audit Institutions|INCOSAI]], the thirteenth triennial convention of the [[International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The '''Central Unitaria de Traballadores''' ('''CUT''', ''Workers Unitary Central'' or ''Workers Unitary Confederation'' in English language) is a [[Galiza|Galician]] union created in the December 1998 after a split with the [[Confederación Intersindical Galega]]. The CUT has very close ties with the [[Galician People's Front]].

The founding congress was held in [[Vigo]] on 19 April 1999. The CUT defines itself as a class union, which aims to defend the interests of the working class. The organization also defends active and combative unionism, as opposed to the mild tactics of the main unions, specially [[Workers Commissions]] and the [[Unión General de Trabajadores]]. It has a [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalist]] and socialist ideology. The CUT has offices in [[Santiago de Compostela]], [[A Coruña]], [[Vigo]], [[Cangas, Pontevedra|Cangas do Morrazo]] and [[Ribeira, Galicia|Ribeira]]. In 2009 600 members of the CUT split (including the majority of the militants of [[A Coruña]] and [[Ferrol (comarca)|Ferrolterra]]) and formed the [[Central Obreira Galega]] (''Galician Workers Central'').&lt;ref&gt;http://old.kaosenlared.net/noticia/galiza-nace-central-obreira-galega-cog-co-fin-ser-sindicato-nacionalis&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45588">[[Image:MondayClub logo.jpg|thumb|200px|Club header from the 1970s]]

The '''Conservative Monday Club''' (usually known as the '''Monday Club''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]] political pressure group, aligned with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], though no longer endorsed by it. It also has links to the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and [[Ulster Unionist Party]].

Founded in 1961, in the belief that the [[Conservative government, 1957–1964|Macmillan ministry]] had taken the party too far to the [[left-wing politics|left]], the club became embroiled in the [[Decolonization|decolonisation]] and [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom|immigration]] debate, inevitably highlighting the controversial issue of [[Racism in the United Kingdom|race]], which has dominated its image ever since. By 1971, the club had 35 MPs, six of them ministers, and 35 [[House of Lords|peer]]s, with membership (including branches) totalling about 10,000.

In 1982, the constitution was re-written, with more emphasis on support for the Conservative Party, but subsequent in-fighting over the club’s "hard right" agenda led to many resignations. In 2001, the Conservatives formally severed relations with the club, which has ceased to exercise significant influence, with full membership below 600.

==History==

===Foundation and early years===
The club was founded on 1 January 1961, by four young Conservative Party members, Paul Bristol (a 24-year-old [[Shipbroking|shipbroker]] and the club's first chairman,&lt;ref&gt;Seyd, Patrick, ''Factionalism within the Conservative Party: The Monday Club'' in ''Government and Opposition'', volume 7, no. 4., 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; who left the club in 1968), Ian Greig (Membership Secretary until 1969), Cedric Gunnery, (later President of the Eton Ramblers Cricket Club) (Treasurer until 1992) and Anthony Maclaren. The club was formed "to force local party associations to discuss and debate party policy". Its first general policy statement deplored the tendency of recent Conservative governments to adopt policies based upon expediency and demanded that instead Tory principles should be the guiding influence. It believed that the principles needing to be reasserted included the preservation of the constitution and existing institutions, the freedom of the individual, the private ownership of property, and the need for Britain to play a leading part in world affairs.&lt;ref&gt;''Policy and Aims''. The Monday Club, December 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; It disliked what it regarded as the expediency, cynicism and materialism which motivated [[Harold Macmillan]]'s government. In addition it was concerned that during this period "the left wing of the Party (had) gained a predominant influence over policy" and that as a result the Conservative Party had shifted to the left, so that "the floating voter could not detect, as he should, major differences between it and the Socialists" and, furthermore, "loyal Conservatives had become disillusioned and dispirited".&lt;ref&gt;''The Aims of the Monday Club'', Executive Council publication, Monday Club, 1970, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The club’s published aims stated that it “seeks to evolve a dynamic application of traditional Tory principles".&lt;ref&gt;''The Monday Club - Organization &amp; Membership'' published on the back cover of the Club's 1968 booklet ''Student Power'' by [[Patrick Wall]], MC, MP.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group brought together supporters of White [[Rhodesia]] and [[apartheid|South Africa]]; the main impetus for the group's formation was the Conservatives' new [[decolonisation]] policies, in particular as a general reaction to Macmillan's '[[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]]' speech made in South Africa. The club stated that Macmillan had "turned the Party Left", and its first pamphlet opposed these policies, as indicative of the Conservative Party's move towards liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Copping, Robert, ''The Story of The Monday Club - The First Decade'', Current Affairs Information Unit, London, April 1972: 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The club is notable for having promoted a policy of voluntary, or assisted, repatriation for non-white immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/oct/19/uk.race Tories cut Monday Club link over race policies]." ''The Guardian''. 19 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20010829/ai_n14419054 ''The Independent'' - Five more names go in purge of Tory right] {{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Arthur James Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|The 5th Marquess of Salisbury]] (1893&amp;ndash;1972), who had resigned from Macmillan's Cabinet over the Prime Minister's liberal direction, became its first president in January 1962, when he stated "there was never a greater need for true conservatism than there is today".&lt;ref&gt;Copping, 1972, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1963 there were eleven Members of Parliament in the Club, which then had an overall membership of about 300.&lt;ref&gt;Copping, 1972, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, Richard, ''Fascism in Britain'', London, 1st edition 1987, revised reprint 2006, p.246, {{ISBN|1-86064-337-X}} where the author also refers to "traditional party supporters feeling intensely alienated by the Heath administration and made their opposition felt through their support of [[Enoch Powell]]".&lt;/ref&gt;
The club was courted by many Conservative politicians, including the Conservative Party leader [[Sir Alec Douglas-Home]] who was guest-of-honour at the club's annual dinners of 1964 and 1969, and [[Enoch Powell]], who, in a speech in 1968, claimed that "it was due to the Monday Club that many are brought within the Conservative Party who might otherwise be estranged from it".&lt;ref name="Copping, 1972 p.26"&gt;Copping, 1972, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

That year [[Alan Clark]] joined the club and was soon chairman of its Wiltshire branch.&lt;ref name="Trewin, Ion 2009"&gt;[[Trewin, Ion]], ''Alan Clark – The Biography'', London, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-297-85073-1}}, pps: 230 &amp; 246-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Under its chairman from 1964 to 1969, [[Paul Williams (Conservative politician)|Paul Williams]], who until 1964 had been MP for Sunderland South, the club enjoyed significant growth and influence. Some argued that the club had a disproportionate influence within Conservative circles, especially after six of its members who were MPs joined the Cabinet in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Messina, Anthony M., ''Race and Party Competition in Britain'', Clarendon Press, 1989, p. 138, {{ISBN|0-19-827534-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold Wilson]], twice Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], described the club as "the guardian of the Tory conscience".&lt;ref name="Copping, 1972 p.26"/&gt; Oxford political scholar [[Roger Griffin]] referred to the club as practising an anti-socialist and elitist form of conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Griffin|Griffin, Roger]], ''The Nature of Fascism'', London, 1991, p. 161, {{ISBN|0-86187-112-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other Monday Club members contested Labour-held seats, some of which had large majorities, and although the challenge was unsuccessful the majorities were reduced. These included Tim Keigwin, who almost unseated the Liberal leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]] at [[North Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|North Devon]], and David Clarke whose personal campaign assistant was the Chairman of the Club's Young Members' Group, Christopher Horne, and who failed by only 76 votes at [[Watford (UK Parliament constituency)|Watford]].&lt;ref name="Copping, 1972 p.22"&gt;Copping, 1972, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1971, the club "undoubtedly had the largest membership of any conservative group and included 55 different groups in universities and colleges, 35 Members of Parliament with six in the government, and 35 Peers". At the club’s Annual General Meeting on 26 April 1971, in [[Westminster Central Hall]], the Chairman, George Pole, announced that "our membership, including national, branches and universities is around 10,000."&lt;ref&gt;Monday Club 'Newsletter'. May/June 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Biggs-Davison]], MP, in his foreword to Robert Copping's second book on the history of the club,&lt;ref&gt;Copping, Robert, ''The Monday Club - Crisis and After'', Current Affairs Information Unit, London, May 1975&lt;/ref&gt; stated that "by its principles [the club] has kept alive true Tory beliefs and held within its ranks many who contemplated defecting from the Conservative and Unionist Party".  The club's chairman in June 1981, David Storey, described it as "an anchor to a ship", referring to the Conservative Party.

===The Thatcher years===
[[Image:Young Monday Clubbers.jpg|thumb|250px|Three of the Young Members' Group at a Club Conference at [[Chilham Castle]], 1980: [[John R. Pinniger]] (YMG Chairman), Richard Turnbull and Gregory Lauder-Frost.]]
The club's revised constitution (21 May 1984) stated that "the objects of the Club are to support the Conservative &amp; Unionist Party in policies designed:
* to maintain loyalty to the Crown and to uphold the sovereignty of Parliament, the security of the realm, and defence of the nation against external aggression and internal subversion;
* to safeguard the liberty of the subject and integrity of the family in accordance with the customs, traditions, and character of the British people;
* to maintain the British constitution in obedience and respect for the laws of the land, freedom of worship and our national heritage;
* to promote an economy consistent with national aspirations and Tory ideals;
* to encourage members of the club to play an active part, at all levels, in the affairs of the Conservative and Unionist Party."

[[Image:MC Party.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Members gather for the club's 20th anniversary riverboat party organised by the Young Members' Group, 15 July 1981.]]
During the period that [[Margaret Thatcher]] led the Conservative Party, the Monday Club were prolific publishers of booklets, pamphlets, policy papers, an occasional newspaper, ''Right Ahead'', and a magazine ''Monday World'' edited for some years by [[Adrian FitzGerald|Sir Adrian FitzGerald, Bart.]], Sam Swerling, and later, Eleanor Dodd. In the October 1982 edition MP [[Harvey Proctor]] called for the scrapping of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]], Sir [[Patrick Wall]] commented on the [[Falklands War]], [[James Molyneaux]] had an article "What Future for Ulster", and Dr. [[Harvey Ward]] had an article on "Zimbabwe Today". The September 1984 edition of ''Monday News'' carried the headline "Kinnock Talks to Terrorists", quoting former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Neil Kinnock]]'s declaration to the [[African National Congress]]'s [[Oliver Tambo]] that the ANC in South Africa could expect financial and material assistance from a future Labour government. Other attacks were made upon then-[[Greater London Council]] leader [[Ken Livingstone]] inviting [[Sinn Féin]] leader [[Gerry Adams]] to visit London in 1982.

===Old Guard departs===
[[Image:MC Russia Dinner.jpg|thumb|250px|The Foreign Affairs Committee were responsible for the club's Russia Dinner on 11 January 1990, with [[Vladimir Cyrillovich, Grand Duke of Russia]], pretender to the Imperial throne, being the guest-of-honour.&lt;ref&gt;''The [[Daily Telegraph]]'', 12 January 1990, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Independent]]'', 13 January 1990, article: "Tsar's heir plans for day of Restoration".&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1988&amp;ndash;9, a group of longstanding members led by Gregory Lauder-Frost, the club's Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, succeeded in getting elected to the key posts on the Executive Council, with Dr. Mark Mayall as Deputy Chairman, and Lauder-Frost as the Political Secretary.

&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Monday01.jpg|thumb|300px|Executive Committee members Gregory Lauder-Frost, Denis Walker, Sam Swerling, Dr.Mark Mayall, April 1991.]] --&gt;
At the beginning of January 1991, the ''Monday Club News'' announced the abolition of the only salaried position, that of Director (then held by the Club's Treasurer, Cedric Gunnery, one of the Club's founders). Although this was due to the club's precarious financial state,&lt;ref&gt;''Monday Club News'', January 1991 (circular)&lt;/ref&gt; some felt more sinister moves afoot. Negative news stories began emerging&lt;ref&gt;''Mail on Sunday'', 3 February 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 24 February 1991, major article by [[David Rose (journalist)|David Rose]].&lt;/ref&gt; and resignations followed. An internal investigation followed. The chairman, David Storey, lost an almost unanimous vote of no confidence on 17 January 1991, and his membership was terminated by the club's Executive Council on 11 February on the grounds that "he has engaged in behaviour prejudicial to the best interests, reputation, objects, and other members of the Monday Club; by abusing his position as Chairman in encouraging members to leave the Monday Club and to join a new political group".&lt;ref&gt;Club Minutes&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Mayall became Acting Chairman until the May AGM when he was confirmed in that post by election. By 1992, the new team had the national (as opposed to branches) membership over 1600 again.

Personal legal problems forced Lauder-Frost's departure on 31 May 1992 and subsequently the club descended into in-fighting, with more departures and failed expulsion attempts resulting in huge legal bills. Dr. Mark Mayall's term as chairman expired in April 1993 and he left the group. Control passed effectively into the hands of [[Denis Walker]], a former Minister for Education in the Rhodesian government. He changed the role of the club from a pressure group to a Conservative Party support group, bringing in a rule that all members must firstly be members of the party, something that prior to 1992 had been constantly opposed.

==Organisation==

===Premises===
The national club established its offices at 51-53 Victoria Street, a few minutes walk from the [[Palace of Westminster]]. The club was, however, always a pressure group, remaining separate from the Conservative Party organisation. Around 1980, the Victoria Street building was cleared for demolition, and the club moved its offices to 122 Newgate Street, London, EC1, opposite the [[Old Bailey]]. High rents forced another move to 4 Orlando Road, Clapham Common, and finally, in 1991, the club's office was moved to an office belonging to W. [[Denis Walker]], opposite [[Highams Park railway station]], with new telephone numbers, and a new Post Office Box number in central London. The newsletter stated that "it is our long-term aim to relocate back to the very heart of London".

===Branches===
In addition to the national club, which operated through an elected Executive Council and numerous policy groups or committees, there were semi-autonomous county branches, a Young Members Monday Club, and numerous university Monday Clubs, the most prominent and active being at the [[University of Oxford]].

===Policy committees===
The Monday Club had various study groups (later renamed policy committees) including:
* Immigration and Repatriation: notable chairmen being [[George Kennedy Young]] &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]&lt;/small&gt;; [[Harvey Proctor]] MP; [[The Honourable]] [[Jonathan Guinness]]; ([[John Bercow]], now an MP and [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]], was committee secretary 1981-82);
* Africa and Rhodesia: [[Harold Soref]] MP
* Home Affairs;
* Aviation;
* Economics: [[George Kennedy Young]] &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]&lt;/small&gt;; Geoffrey Baber, [[Piers Dixon]], MP&lt;ref&gt;Monday Club Newsletter, July 1968, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Taxation: David Rowell, LL.B.
* Universities Group; Graham Webster-Gardiner,&lt;ref&gt;Graham Webster-Gardiner was elected Chairman of the Club's Universities Group in 1969; he was later the [[UKIP]] Candidate for Epsom and Ewell in the 2001 General Election.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Turnbull, Michael Clack&lt;ref&gt;Monday Club Newsletters, 1990-91&lt;/ref&gt;
* Young Members Group; Christopher Horne, the Conservative Party candidate in both 1974 General Elections in the Manchester Central and Meriden Constituencies, Dr. [[Anna Bramwell]], David Rowell, Eleanor Dodd, [[John R. Pinniger]], AVR Smith, Rod Morris.
* Defence: [[The Honourable]] [[Archie Hamilton, Baron Hamilton of Epsom|Archibald Hamilton]] MP; [[Major]] [[Patrick Wall|Sir Patrick Wall]] MP &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Volunteer Reserve Decoration|VRD]]&lt;/small&gt;; Commander [[Anthony Courtney]] MP &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]&lt;/small&gt;; [[Rear-Admiral]] Martin Wemyss &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the Bath|CB]]&lt;/small&gt;
* Foreign Affairs: [[Geoffrey Stewart-Smith]] MP; [[John Wodehouse, 4th Earl of Kimberley|The Earl of Kimberley]],&lt;ref name="Dod p.172"/&gt; [[John Russell Carlisle|John Carlisle]] MP and Gregory Lauder-Frost.

==Foreign affairs==

===Anti-communism===
[[Image:WGI Dinner.jpg|thumb|250px|left|At the [[Western Goals Institute]]'s El Salvador Dinner, London, 25 September 1989. L to R: [[Denis Walker]], [[Merlin Hanbury-Tracy, 7th Baron Sudeley|Lord Sudeley]], [[El Salvador]]'s Foreign Minister, Andrew Smith (yellow tie), Dr [[Harvey Ward]]]]
The club was [[anti-communist]] and had an active Defence Committee chaired for over 15 years by Sir [[Patrick Wall]], MP, MC, and produced much literature on the perceived threat posed by Soviets and communists everywhere.

When it appeared that communism was failing in the [[Eastern Bloc]], the club's Foreign Affairs Committee called upon Members of Parliament to be ready and to argue for the German borders to be restored to the position they stood at on 1 January 1938, saying there must be no gains for communism.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Independent]]'', 4 March 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Club officers, including Gregory Lauder-Frost, [[Denis Walker]], and Lord Sudeley, attended a [[Western Goals Institute]] dinner in September 1989 in honour of [[El Salvador|Salvadorian]] president [[Alfredo Cristiani]], whose military was at the time fighting the [[FMLN]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'', Court &amp; Social pages, both on 26 September 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The club also took a hard line on the return of White Russians by the British Army to Joseph Stalin's Red Army in 1945&amp;ndash;6, who executed nearly all of them. In this respect it gave its support to Count [[Nikolai Tolstoy]], historian and author of ''[[Victims of Yalta]]'' and ''[[The Minister and the Massacres]]'', who was then being sued for libel, by holding a dinner for him at London's [[Charing Cross Hotel]] on 26 October 1988.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Court &amp; Social columns, 27 October 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===

The club opposed what it described as the "premature" independence of [[Kenya]], and the breakup of the [[Central African Federation]], which was the subject of its first major public meeting in September 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Copping, 1972 p.6&lt;/ref&gt; It was fundamentally opposed to decolonisation, and defended [[white minority rule]] in [[South Africa]] and [[Rhodesia]].

During the [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] (UDI) period in [[Rhodesia]], the club strongly backed the White minority government of [[Ian Smith]] and the [[Rhodesian Front]], being seen as its strongest supporters in Britain. In November 1963, the club had hosted a large reception for Smith at the Howard Hotel in London.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} That was followed the next year by receptions for [[Clifford Dupont]] and [[Moise Tshombe]]. The club continued its support for white minority rule in South Africa, with Lauder-Frost organising a large dinner in central London, on 5 June 1989, for its guest-of-honour Dr [[Andries Treurnicht]], Leader of the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party of South Africa]], and his delegation. [[Tim Janman]], MP, and the Lord Sudeley were amongst those present from Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]'', Court &amp; Social columns, 6 June 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===

[[Denis Walker]], Rod Morris.]]
The government of [[Franjo Tuđman]] in [[Croatia]] invited the Monday Club to send a delegation to observe its conflict with [[Serbia]], in October 1991, when the war for Croatian independence from the tottering [[Yugoslavia]] was at its height, with the armies of both sides engaged in serious fighting. The Club delegation arrived just days after the Yugoslav Air Force bombing of the historic upper city in [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref&gt;Almond, Mark, ''Europe's Backyard War - The War in the [[Balkans]]'', Heinemann, London, 1994, pps:223-9.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first British political delegation to go to Croatia during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 5 May 1992, carried a letter from Gregory Lauder-Frost on behalf of the Club about this delegation and its findings.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Debate within the club was intense on the European issue. In the early days of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) one of the club's MPs, [[Geoffrey Rippon]], was so pro-EEC that he was known as "Mr. Europe". Because of the divisions within the club on this issue the decision was taken not to have a policy on it. However, by 1980 the mood had changed. A club discussion paper in October 1980 was entitled "Do Tories Really want to Scrap 80% of Britain's Fishing Fleet", and the club adopted a firm anti-[[European Union]] (EU) position. [[Teddy Taylor]], an anti-EEC MP, became chairman of the club's EEC Affairs Policy Committee and authored a club policy paper in December 1982 entitled "Proposals to Rescue the British Fishing Industry". The club's Scottish branch's newspaper, ''The Challenger'', carried a further article against the EU by Taylor in September 1985 entitled "Swallowing the Nation".

[[Enoch Powell]] also spoke against the EU at one of the Monday Club's fringe meetings at the Conservative Party Conference at Blackpool on 8 October 1991, with Lauder-Frost presiding, which was filmed and broadcast on [[BBC Television|BBC TV]]'s ''[[Newsnight]]'' that night. In 1992, the chairman, Dr. Mark Mayall, authored another club booklet entitled: ''Maastricht: The High Tide of European Federalism'', a fierce attack on the EU.

==Immigration==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:MC Facts.jpg|thumb|200px|right|First of a six page paper from the Club's Immigration Committee in 1989, chaired by Jonathan Guinness]] --&gt;
In September 1972, the club held a "Halt Immigration Now!" public meeting in [[Westminster Central Hall]], opposite Parliament, at which the speakers [[Ronald Bell (UK politician)|Ronald Bell]], QC, MP, [[John Biggs-Davison]], MP, [[Harold Soref]], MP, and [[John Heydon Stokes]], MP, (all club members) called on the government to halt all immigration, repeal the [[Race Relations Act 1968|Race Relations Act]], not the separate [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]], and start a full repatriation scheme. A resolution was drafted, approved by the meeting, and delivered to the Prime Minister, [[Edward Heath]], who replied that "the government had no intention of repealing the Race Relations Act". When [[Reginald Maudling]] resigned from the Cabinet, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] leader, [[Jeremy Thorpe]], commented that "Mr. Heath has been left to wrestle with the Monday Club single-handed."&lt;ref&gt;Copping, 1975, pp. 6&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1982, the Monday Club published its latest, slightly revised, policy on immigration. It called for:
# Scrapping of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]] and Community Relations Councils.
# Repeal of the race relations laws.
# An end to the use of race or colour as criteria for the distribution of state benefits &amp; loans.
# An end to positive discrimination and all special treatment based upon race or colour.
# An end to all further large-scale permanent immigration from the [[New Commonwealth]].
# An improved repatriation scheme with generous resettlement grants for all those from New Commonwealth countries who wish to take advantage of them.
# The redesignation of the Ministry of Overseas Aid as a Ministry for Overseas Resettlement.

The club's position on immigration was reiterated in a letter in ''[[The Times]]'' from Lauder-Frost on the club's behalf in October 1991 where he stated that the annual levels of immigration "were unacceptable" and called for "the strictest possible entry to Britain for those of other cultures".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' (letters), 9 October 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Ireland==
Following an [[Official Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) bombing at [[Aldershot]], [[Hampshire]], in February 1972, club member and MP [[Jill Knight]] called for legislation to outlaw the Official IRA and its political wing, [[Official Sinn Féin]]. The club was opposed to the dismantling of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont government]] in Northern Ireland and the imposition of direct rule.&lt;ref&gt;Copping, 1975, pp. 5, 6, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September 1989, Lauder-Frost, on behalf of the Club, denounced "the disgraceful [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]]" in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ansionnachfionn.com/2016/06/17/the-killer-of-jo-cox-the-springbok-club-and-its-unionist-associations/|title=The Killer Of Jo Cox, The Springbok Club And It’s Unionist Associations|date=17 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and criticism==
''The Guardian''  claimed in 1968 that the organisation was "probably the nearest British equivalent to the American [[John Birch Society]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Powell and His Allies'', Labour Research Department, (p. 12) 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed by opponents of the club that many members had drawn closer to the [[British National Front|National Front]], it being reported as early as 1973 that NF members were moving to take over branches of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907114,00.html|title=Domain Inquiry|website=jcgi.pathfinder.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bad publicity led to a crisis culminating in a series of purges, mainly in Club branches.&lt;ref&gt;Copping, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Diaries'', [[Alan Clark]] describes speaking to the Monday Club in 1982: "I really cannot bear the Monday Club. They are all mad, quite different from its heyday, when it was a right-wing pressure group at the time of Ted Heath's Government. Now they are a prickly residue in the body politic, a nasty sort of gallstone."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Clark]], ''Diaries: Into Politics'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2000, p. 337, {{ISBN|0-297-64402-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The playwright [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] described the Monday Club, in 1986, as "proselytis[ing] the ancient and venerable conservative traditions of [[paternalism]], [[imperialism]] and [[racism]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Levitas|Levitas, Ruth]], (editor), ''The Ideology of the New Right'', Cambridge, 1986, p. 60, {{ISBN|0-7456-0190-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 February 1991, ''[[The Observer]]'' ran a lengthy article entitled "Far Right takes over the Monday Club", stating that a number of senior members had tendered their resignations in protest at the club's "takeover" by "extreme right-wingers", some of whom were also members of the [[Western Goals Institute]]. The Club's solicitors, Rubenstein, Callingham &amp; Gale, sent a formal letter of protest to the editor of the ''Observer'' about the article, and demanded a right of reply for the Club. The editor agreed and Lauder-Frost, writing on behalf of the club, subsequently challenged the article's accusations in a [[Letter to the Editor]], which was published the following Sunday. He denied that a takeover had occurred, claimed that none of the club's policies had changed and that its direction was consistent with its aims and historical principles.

After the defeats in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], the Conservative Party began decisive moves towards becoming more centrist; the 2002&amp;ndash;2003 party chairman and future Prime Minister, [[Theresa May]], would later state that it had been perceived by voters as the "Nasty Party". The then party leader, [[Iain Duncan Smith]], suspended the Monday Club's longstanding links with the party in October 2001,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1607279.stm Tories suspend link with Monday Club]." ''BBC News''. 18 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; saying his party would have nothing to do with the organisation unless it stopped making "distasteful" remarks on race and immigration.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1978846.stm Right-wing club appeals for Tory return]." ''BBC News''. 10 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1993 new full members of the club must be members of the Conservative Party, though there is no such requirement for associate membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservativeuk.com/mcapp.pdf Monday Club membership application form] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412125537/http://www.conservativeuk.com/mcapp.pdf |date=2016-04-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Monday Club observers, such as [[Denis Walker]], have attended [[Democratic Unionist Party]] conferences.

The club has been sometimes described as "far-right" by journalists in newspapers across the political spectrum from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' to ''[[The Guardian]]'' and, in 2002, as a "bastion on the Tory hard right" by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1978846.stm | work=BBC News | title=Right-wing club appeals for Tory return | date=10 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurlow, however, stated that it was doubted that members of the Monday Club were secret or even potential fascists.&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, 2006, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; The club's agenda stresses support for what it calls "traditional Conservative values", including "resistance to '[[political correctness]]{{'"}}.

==Suspension of links by the Conservative Party (2001)==
Faction fighting within the club following Lauder-Frost's departure led to a period of instability and a resulting loss of membership. The club's influence declined. Although the Monday Club was a completely autonomous pressure-group and not part of the Conservative Party organisation, Conservative Party chairman [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] informed the club's National Executive in 2001 that links between it and the party were being severed until it stopped promoting several of its (long-held and established&lt;ref&gt;Messina, 1989, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;) policies such as the voluntary repatriation of ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name=TGraph&gt;{{cite news|last=Sparrow|first=Andrew|title=Duncan Smith orders Monday Club to suspend Tory links|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1359863/Duncan-Smith-orders-Monday-Club-to-suspend-Tory-links.html|accessdate=16 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=19 October 2001|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis later told the media: "I have told them that until a number of things are concluded&amp;mdash;particularly some concerns about the membership of the club, and a review of the club's constitution and a requirement that the club will not promulgate or discuss policies relating to race&amp;mdash;the club is suspended from any association with the Conservative party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/oct/19/uk.race|title=Tories cut Monday Club link over race policies|first=Nicholas|last=Watt|date=19 October 2001|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three MPs, [[Andrew Hunter (British politician)|Andrew Hunter]], [[Andrew Rosindell]] and [[Angela Watkinson]], were ordered to resign from the club.

On 10 May 2002, the [[BBC]] reported that the club sought to restore its links with the Conservative Party.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /&gt; At the following club Annual General meeting in April 2002, members approved two motions proposed by [[Michael Keith Smith]], (also Chairman of the [[Conservative Democratic Alliance]]); one reaffirming the club's opposition to mass immigration, and another empowering Club officers to institute legal action against the Conservative Party following the club's 'suspension' by them. A third motion, asking the club to call for the sacking of [[John Bercow]], then [[Shadow Cabinet|Shadow]] [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and former Monday Club member, for his "hypocrisy", was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Independent]]'', 18 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' reported (2 June 2006) that, as the club "is now slowly nudging back into the mainstream, many members feel that it is time to return to the fold".

The Monday Club, having changed its original ''raison d'être'' as a pressure group in 1993, and whose membership is now said to be back below 600, now has very little influence on the agenda of the Conservative Party. Many of its former members joined the (now-defunct) [[Conservative Democratic Alliance]] and the Traditional Britain Group.

Council of Europe's Group of State Against Corruption (GRECO) in its evaluation report noted that specificities of Switzerland's institutions which enjoy considerable public confidence. It underlines, however, that the very organisation of the system allows subtle pressure to be exerted on politicians and the judiciary'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/greco/-/council-of-europe-s-anti-corruption-body-calls-on-switzerland-to-develop-ethical-rules-applicable-to-federal-members-of-parliament-judges-and-prosecut|title=Council of Europe's Anti-Corruption body calls on Switzerland to develop ethical rules applicable to federal members of parliament, judges and prosecutors|work=Group of States against Corruption|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 3rd place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extent ==
[[Switzerland]] has a strong legal framework to combat corruption and several authorities are in charge of curbing the levels of it, particularly when it comes to corruption within [[Swiss financial institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snapshot of the Switzerland Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/switzerland/snapshot.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several sources suggest that the country's fight against corruption has been effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Investment Climate Statement - Switzerland (Including Lichtenstein)|url=https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2013/204740.htm|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Report 2012- Switzerland|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204346|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Transparency International]] Global Barometer 2013 shows that 58% of the surveyed households believe that corruption has not changed over the past two years, and 28% believe that it has actually increased. The same survey also shows that [[Political parties in Switzerland|political parties]] are considered the most corrupt institution in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding business and corruption, companies do not consider corruption a problem for doing business in Switzerland, and Swiss companies are active in [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] that are generally in line with [[OECD]] Guidelines for multinational enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snapshot of the Switzerland Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/switzerland/snapshot.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the Swiss system has also enabled some types of organisation to operate with little or no transparency or oversight. For example, International sporting organisations (ISO's) can have the legal status of an international Non Governmental Organisation. Encouraged by the resulting range of legal and fiscal privileges, something like 50 such ISO's are based in the Canton of Vaud alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7772">'''Cyber Essentials''' is a UK government information assurance scheme operated by the [[National Cyber Security Centre (United Kingdom)|National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)]] that encourages organisations to adopt good practice in information security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government scheme shows who can be trusted on cyber security|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet-security/10877217/Government-scheme-shows-who-can-be-trusted-on-cyber-security.html|accessdate=1 July 2014|work=Telegraph|date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes an assurance framework and a simple set of security controls to protect information from threats coming from the internet. 

It was developed in collaboration with industry partners, including the Information Security Forum ([[Information Security Forum|ISF]]), the Information Assurance for Small and Medium Enterprises Consortium ([[IASME]]) and the British Standards Institution ([[BSI Group|BSI]]), and is endorsed by the UK Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317481/Cyber_Essentials_Requirements.pdf|title=Cyber Essentials Scheme|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=HM Government|access-date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 2014 by the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Cyber Essentials' scheme launched|url=http://ico.org.uk/news/current_topics/cyber-essentials|publisher=ICO|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assurance framework==
Organisations can earn two levels of certification, or badges:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber Essentials Scheme Assurance Framework|url=https://www.cyberstreetwise.com/cyberessentials/files/assurance-framework.pdf|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hotchin|first1=Jenny|title=Mitigating the risks created by cyber attacks|url=http://www.smeweb.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4891:mitigating-the-risks-created-by-cyber-attacks&amp;catid=64:features&amp;Itemid=102|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cyber Essentials: Organisations self-assess their systems, and this assessment is independently verified.
* Cyber Essentials Plus: Systems are independently tested, and Cyber Essentials is integrated into the organisation's information risk management. 

Annual recertification is recommended. Certifying Bodies are, in turn, licensed by Accreditation Bodies, which have been appointed by UK government.The five current accreditation bodies are [https://apmg-cyber.com/products/cyber-essentials APMG], [http://www.crest-approved.org/ CREST], [https://www.iasme.co.uk/ IASME], [https://irmsecurity.com/ IRM security] and [http://www.qgstandards.co.uk/ QG].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cyberaware.gov.uk/cyberessentials/get.html|title=Cyber Essentials - OFFICIAL SITE|website=www.cyberaware.gov.uk|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Council of Registered Ethical Security Testers|CREST]] has developed an assessment framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CREST supports UK Government Cyber Essentials scheme|url=http://www.crest-approved.org/industry-government/cyber-essentials/|publisher=CREST|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IASME]], one of the Accreditation Bodies, has incorporated the Cyber Essentials into the wider IASME information assurance standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iasme.co.uk/cyber-essentials-scheme/|title=Cyber Essentials Scheme – IASME|website=www.iasme.co.uk|access-date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with [[ISO/IEC 27001]], organisations may choose to limit the scope of certification to a certain subset of their business.

==Controls==
The five main technical controls are:
#Boundary [[firewall (computing)|firewall]]s and internet gateways
#[[Configuration management|Secure configuration]] 
#[[Access control]]
#[[Malware]] protection
#[[Patch (computing)|Patch]] management

Cyber Essentials guidance breaks these down into finer details. These controls can be mapped against the controls required by [[ISO/IEC 27001]], the [[Standard of Good Practice]], and [[IASME Governance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Requirements for basic technical protection from cyber attacks|url=https://www.cyberstreetwise.com/cyberessentials/files/requirements.pdf|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Cyber Essentials has a narrower focus, emphasising technical controls rather than governance, risk, and policy.

==History==
The Cyber Essentials scheme was launched on 5 June 2014. Several organisations were quickly certified by the end of June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First seven SMEs bite on Government's flagship Cyber Essentials scheme|url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/security/3527693/first-seven-smes-bite-on-governments-flagship-cyber-essentials-scheme/|accessdate=1 July 2014|work=Computer World|date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since October 2014, Cyber Essentials certification has been required for suppliers to central UK government who handle certain kinds of sensitive and personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber essentials scheme: overview|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-essentials-scheme-overview|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is intended to encourage adoption by businesses wishing to bid for government contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cyber risk and the UK’s Cyber Essentials Scheme|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Cyber-risk-and-the-UKs-Cyber-Essentials-Scheme|accessdate=1 July 2014|work=Computer Weekly|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insurers have suggested that certified bodies may attract lower insurance premiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government launches Cyber Essentials security scheme|url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2348676/government-launches-cyber-essentials-security-scheme|accessdate=1 July 2014|date=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 6,000 Cyber Essentials certificates have been awarded to businesses and organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matt Hancock's Cyber Security Speech|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/matt-hancocks-cyber-security-speech-at-the-institute-of-directors-conference|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[WannaCry ransomware attack]] [[NHS Digital]] refused to finance the £1 billion which was the estimated cost of meeting the Cyber Essentials Plus standard, saying this would not constitute value for money and that it had invested over £60 million and planned  plan to spend a further £150 million to address key cyber security weaknesses over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Health chiefs refuse to foot £1bn bill to improve NHS cyber security |url=https://www.buildingbetterhealthcare.co.uk/news/article_page/Health_chiefs_refuse_to_foot_1bn_bill_to_improve_NHS_cyber_security/147855/cn164706 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |publisher=Building Better Healthcare |date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Demico Boothe''' is an [[African American|African-American]] bestselling author of several books.

==Biography==
Born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], he spent nearly 13 years in [[List of U.S. federal prisons|federal prison]] and was released in 2003. He wrote his first book, entitled ''Why Are So Many Black Men in Prison?'' while incarcerated, and to date has written and published two other books entitled, ''Getting Out &amp; Staying Out: A Black Man's Guide to Success After Prison'' and ''The Top 25 Things Black Folks Do That We Need To Stop!!!''. The latter was published in January 2009 and received much critical acclaim within the [[African-American]] community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fullsurfacepublishing.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Demico Boothe is a noted expert on many subjects and issues concerning the African-American community, with an emphasis on the U.S. [[Criminal justice|criminal justice system]] as it relates to [[Black people|black males]]. On the back of his book ''Why Are So Many Black Men in Prison?'', he states that he read and studied over 500 books while he was incarcerated, including the entire [[Webster's dictionary]], [[Bible]], [[Qur'an]], and every alphabetic entry of the 1998 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].

He is slated to release his fourth title with Full Surface Publishing in late 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10456">A '''director general''' or ''director-general'' (plural: ''directors generals'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/director+general Random House Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/director-general Collins English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/director_general ]&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes ''director generals'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/director%20general ]&lt;/ref&gt;  or '''general director''' is a senior [[executive (government)|executive]] officer, often the [[chief executive officer]], within a [[government]]al, statutory, [[NGO]], [[Voluntary sector|third sector]] or [[not-for-profit]] [[institution]]. It is commonly used in many countries worldwide, but with various meanings.

==Australia==
In most Australian states, the director-general is the most senior civil servant in any government department, reporting only to the democratically elected [[minister (government)|minister]] representing that department. In Victoria and the [[Australian Government]], the equivalent position is the [[Departmental secretary|secretary]] of the department.

The [[Australian Defence Force Cadets]] has three Directors-General which are all [[one-star rank]]s:
*Director-General of the [[Australian Navy Cadets]]
*Director-General of the [[Australian Army Cadets]]
*Director-General of the [[Australian Air Force Cadets]]

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], the title director general is used in the federal civil service, known as the [[Public Service of Canada]].  A director general in the federal government is typically not the most senior civil servant in a department.  Directors general typically report to a more senior civil servant, such as an assistant deputy minister or associate deputy minister.  The title "director general" is not usually used within the civil services of the ten provincial governments, nor the three territorial governments; instead, these civil services usually use the title "executive director", or "director".  [[Deputy minister (Canada)|Deputy ministers]] are the highest level bureaucrat within the [[Canadian civil service]] at the federal, provincial and territorial levels.  Deputy ministers are not politicians but professional bureaucrats.  Outside the federal, provincial and territorial civil services, some public sector agencies such as school boards in [[Quebec]] use the title "director general".

==European Union==
[[File:ESO and ESA Directors General sign cooperation agreement.jpg|thumb|[[ESO]] and [[ESA]] Directors-general sign cooperation agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ESO and ESA Directors General Sign Cooperation Agreement|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15064/|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the [[European Commission]] and the [[Council of the European Union]], each department (called a [[directorate-general]]) is headed by a non-political director-general. This is roughly equivalent to a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[permanent secretary]].

==France==
In [[France]], the similar word '''président-directeur général''' (PDG) means the highest person in a company, who is at the same time [[chairman]] (''président'') of board of directors and [[CEO]] (''directeur général''). From 2001 the two charges may be disjointed. The ''directeur général délégué'' has a role similar to that of a chief operating officer.

French [[ministry (government department)|ministries]] are divided in general directorates (''directions générales''), sometimes named central directorates (''directions centrales'')  or simply directorates (''directions''), headed respectively by a ''directeur général'', a ''directeur central'', or a ''directeur''.

==Germany==
In [[Germany]], ''Generaldirektor'' may be used for the CEO of a large and established concern, corporation, company or enterprise, particularly if subordinates have the title [[Director (business)|director]]. The title is, however, unofficial (theoretically any person, and even practically every entrepreneur with one employee, may call himself director-general) and by now largely out of use. Officially a [[GmbH]] has a ''Geschäftsführer'' ("managing director"), an [[Aktiengesellschaft]], and a board of executive directors (Vorstand) with a chairman (Vorstandsvorsitzender).

The term is also used by [[German Institute Taipei]], Germany's informal representative mission to the [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]], to refer to its [[head of mission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Director General and the individual sections |url=http://www.taipei.diplo.de/Vertretung/taipei/en/02-GI/Generaldirektor__und__Abteilungen/Behoerdenleiter__und__Abteilungen.html |work=[[German Institute Taipei]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
In [[India]], there is a [[Director General of Police]] and Director General of Income Tax in each state. The Assam Rifles is headed by the Director General of Assam Rifles.{{cn|date=October 2017}} The Indian Coast Guard is headed by the [[Director General of Indian Coast Guard]] (DGICG). The [[National Security Guard]] is headed by the [[Director General of National Security Guard]]. The [[Central Armed Police Force]] are also headed by their respective Director Generals.

==Italy==
In [[Italy]], the ''direttore generale'' of a company is a [[corporate officer]] who reports to the CEO (''amministratore delegato'') and has duties similar to a [[chief operating officer]].

Some Italian [[ministry (government department)|ministries]] are divided into departments (''dipartimenti'') who are in turn divided into general directorates (''direzioni generali'') headed by a ''direttore generale''. Other ministries, who do not have departments, are directly divided into general directorates. In [[provinces of Italy|Italian provinces]] and greatest [[communes of Italy|communes]], ''direttore generale'' is a [[chief administrative officer]] nominated by the president of province or by the mayor. The title of ''direttore generale'' is also given to the chief executive of an ''azienda sanitaria'', a local public agency for health services.

== Philippines ==
The word '''Director-General''' was used in the Philippines as a highest ranking law enforcer, which means the head of a law enforcement agency. Such agencies are:
* [[Philippine National Police]]
* [[Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency]]
* [[Bureau of Corrections (Philippines)|Bureau of Corrections]]

==Russia==
A '''general director''' is the highest executive position in a [[Russia]]n company, analogous to a US chief executive officer (CEO), or a UK managing director. The position exists for all [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) legal forms (e.g. [[Joint-stock company|joint stock companies]] (AO) and [[Limited liability company|limited-liability companies]] (OOO)), except for [[sole proprietorship]]s (IP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bird|first=Richard|title=Improving Tax Administration in Developing Countries, Том 19|year=1992|publisher=International Monetary Fund|location=Russia|page=344|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klh2osNYC94C&amp;pg=PA34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general director is the "single-person executive body" of a company. He or she acts without [[power of attorney]] to represent the company, and issues powers of attorney to others. His or her powers are defined by the company charter, by decision of the general meeting of [[shareholder]]s (AO) or participants (OOO), and by the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aT4htmBySKoC&amp;pg=PA192 |title=Russia Company Laws and Regulations Handbook |publisher=International Business Publications, USA |first= |last= |isbn=1433070529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
In [[Spain]], [[México]], and other Spanish-speaking countries, the term "director general" of a company (similar to a US corporation) is either the general manager or CEO of the company.

==Sweden==
In [[Sweden]], the cognate word '''Generaldirektör''' (GD) is the generic title for the head of a [[Government agencies in Sweden|State agency]], unless otherwise prescribed by higher authority. For purposes of English translations, the word '''Director-General''' is officially used.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom|UK's]] [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]], a '''director-general''' is now usually a Senior Civil Servant (SCS) at Pay Band 3 Level who heads up a group of other Directors and reports directly to the Permanent Secretary of a department.

For historical reasons it has also been retained as the professional title of the chief executive officers in some organisations which predate the current SCS structure and therefore may be used by those people despite them working at different pay bands. For example, the head of the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s internal Security Service [[MI5]] is also called a Director-General, despite the fact that the post is at [[Permanent Secretary]] (Pay Band 4) level. (See [[Her Majesty's Civil Service#Grading schemes]] for details.) Other organisations include the chief executive of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], who also use the title but have no link to the civil service grading structure.

==United States==
This term is used in [[international organisation]]s and government departments, although this sort of position is more commonly called an "executive director" or "managing director" in the [[United States]].

Typically, the chief administrative officer of an [[opera]] company in the US holds the title of "General Director". Such is the case with singer and conductor [[Plácido Domingo]], who currently functions in that capacity for the [[Los Angeles Opera]], as he had previously for the [[Washington National Opera]]. In another prominent example, [[Speight Jenkins]] served as the general director of the [[Seattle Opera]] for over three decades. General directors are often responsible for artistic decisions, such as which operas to perform and which singers to hire, in addition to financial matters. The [[Metropolitan Opera]] is one of the few exceptions among US opera houses; the head of its administration is known as a "[[general manager]]" rather than a general director.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3946">[[File:Feliks Volkhovskiy.jpg|thumb|Feliks Volkhovsky, late 19th century]] '''Feliks Vadimovich Volkhovsky''' ({{lang-ru|Феликс Вадимович Волховский}}; 1846 in [[Poltava]] &amp;ndash; July 21 (August 3), 1914) was a Russian revolutionary, journalist and writer.  Volkhovsky became involved in radical student politics in St Petersburg in the 1860s. In 1867, he co-founded the 'One Rouble Society' with [[German Lopatin]]; it was dedicated to propaganda and educational work among the masses. After several arrests, Volkhovsky moved to Odessa in 1873, where he organised a circle affiliated with the [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]]. One of the members of Volkhovsky's Odessa group was [[Andrei Zhelyabov]], later one of the principal organisers of the assassination of [[Tsar Alexander II]].

Volkhovsky was arrested again in 1874 and was a defendant at the 1878 'Trial of the 193'. Banished to Siberia, he escaped in 1889 via America. Volkhovsky was involved in '[[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]]' and, when that group split in 1879, in '[[The People's Will]]'. After escaping from Siberia, he made his way to Western Europe, eventually settling in [[London]]. He worked for the ''Free Russian Press'' and was a close friend and collaborator of the revolutionary writer [[Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky|S.M. Stepniak-Kravchinsky]]. In fact, Stepniak was on his way to visit Volkhovsky when he was killed by a train in 1895. Volkhovsky thereafter took over Stepniak's editorial duties at the journal ''Free Russia''.

Volkhovsky served as a bridge-builder within the Russian opposition movement and between Russian radicals and the Western European public. He was in contact with older Russian émigrés of the generation of [[Alexander Herzen|A.I. Herzen]] and young 'nihilists', with anarchists as well as political revolutionaries, with Russian social revolutionaries as well as liberals. He helped bring together Russian and Ukrainian social revolutionaries, protested against pogroms in Russia and resisted anti-Semitic tendencies in the Russian revolutionary movement.   He also did his best to represent the Russian opposition movement to the West, maintaining contacts with British, French and German socialist parties, contributing articles to British and Americal papers (including the ''[[New York Times]]'') and writing pamphlets aimed at the Western audience. He was involved in the Anglo-American [[Society of Friends of Russian Freedom]].   In the early 1900s (decade), Volkhovsky joined the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]].

{{English Feudalism}}
Under [[feudalism|the feudal system]] in [[England]], a '''feoffee''' is a [[trustee]] who holds a [[fief]] (or "fee"), that is to say an [[estate in land]], for the use of a beneficial owner. The term is more fully stated as a '''feoffee to uses''' of the beneficial owner. The use of such trustees developed towards the end of the era of feudalism in the [[middle ages]] and became obsolete with the formal ending of that social and economic system in 1660. Indeed the development of feoffees to uses may have hastened the end of the feudal system, since their operation circumvented vital feudal fiscal mechanisms.

==Development==
The practice of [[Enfeoffment|enfeoffing]] feoffees with fees, that is to say of granting legal [[seizin]] in one's land-holdings ("holdings" as only the king himself "owned" land by his [[allodial title]]) to a group of trusted friends or relatives or other allies whilst retaining use of the lands, began to be widespread by about 1375.&lt;ref name="McFarlane-p146"&gt;McFarlane, p.146&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of such an action was two-fold:
*Akin to modern [[tax avoidance]], it was a legal loop-hole to avoid the suffering of the customary [[feudal incident]]s, namely the payment of [[feudal relief]] on an inheritance, the temporary loss of control of a [[fiefdom]] through [[ward (law)|wardship]] where the landholder was under the age of [[majority]] of 21, and the forcible marriage of a young heiress. Nor could the land-holding [[escheat]], that is to say revert permanenly to the overlord, as was customary where the land-holder died without a legal heir. When the fiefdom was held by a group of feoffees, the death of the beneficial holder was legally irrelevant to its continued holding by them. They simply allowed the lands to continue to be used by the deceased's heir. The feoffees were "an undying corporation which never suffered a minority and could not be given in marriage" (McFarlane, p.&amp;nbsp;146). The feudal overlord, the king himself if the land was held [[Tenant-in-chief|in-chief]], was not entitled to exact feudal relief from the new beneficiary nor was he entitled to seize control of the lands and their revenues until such heir was of full-age, nor was he entitled to sell the heiress in marriage or to marry her to one of his own sons. This had a considerably deleterious effect on the royal finances, which state of affairs was rectified by the aggressive and imaginative new fiscal measures taken by [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]] after his accession in 1485.
*The land-holder was able effectively to bequeath his land to whomsoever he wished, and was no longer bound by the custom of ''[[primogeniture]]'' where the eldest son alone had the right, on payment of the appropriate [[feudal relief]], to inherit, that is to demand to be re-enfeoffed with his father's land-holdings by his father's overlord.

The effect was that on a man's death he appeared to hold little or no land, whilst in reality he had full use of it and of the revenues derived from it. If he was thought by the county [[escheator]] to have been a [[tenant-in-chief]], a jury for an [[Escheat roll|Inquisition ''post mortem'']] would be convened to enquire into what manors he held from the king and who was his legal heir. Frequently the verdict of such inquisitions even in the case of the decease of the most influential men of the county, was "he holds no lands of the king in this county". Such reports can be a major source of confusion to the modern historian or biographer who is unaware of the operation of feoffees to uses. As McFarlane summarised "it can make a great landowner (sic) appear to die a landless man".&lt;ref name="McFarlane-p146" /&gt;

==Procedure for creation==
To effect such an arrangement a sealed charter was usually drawn up which specified all relevant matters, such as who the feoffees were to be, to whose use the feoffees were to hold the lands, for what period, who were the desired heirs of the settlor, what provision should be made for his widow, etc. Such charter appears as a conveyance or alienation, and may be mistaken as such by the unwary modern researcher. Likewise, such a charter may be misinterpreted by the modern observer as signifying that those named as recipients of the conveyance are themselves beneficial owners in the form of a commercial partnership, and therefore may be mistaken for wealthy men.

==Legal status==
Feoffee is thus a [[Legal history|historical]] term relating to the law of [[Trust law|trusts]] and [[Equity (law)|equity]], referring to the owner of a legal title of a [[property]] when he is not the [[equity (legal concept)|equitable]] owner. Feoffees essentially had their titles stripped by the [[Statute of Uses]] 1535, whereby the legal title to the property being held by the feoffee was transferred to their ''[[cestui que]] use''. The modern equivalent of a ''feoffee to uses'' is the [[trustee]], one who holds a legal and managerial ownership in [[Trust law|trust]] for the enjoyment benefit and use of the [[beneficiary]].

==Modern usage==
The term is still in occasional use today to mean a trustee invested with a freehold estate held in possession for a purpose, typically a charitable one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/feoffee|title=feoffee|last=Anon|work=oxforddictionaries.com|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples include: the trustees of the [[Chetham's Hospital]] charity in [[Manchester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chethams.com/about-chets/governance|title=Governance|last=Anon|work=www.chethams.com|publisher= Chetham's School of Music|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the towns of [[Colyton, Devon]] and [[Bungay]] in Suffolk, and the trustees of the Sponne and Bickerstaffe charity in [[Towcester]], Northamptonshire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://193.132.104.74/nra/onlinelists/GB0154%20TC1-853.pdf Towcester Charities deposit in Northamptonshire Records Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704024729/http://193.132.104.74/nra/onlinelists/GB0154%20TC1-853.pdf |date=4 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Feoffees of [[St Michael's Church, Spurriergate, York|St Michael's Spurriergate]] are the trustees of a charity that helps with the restoration of churches in [[York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2006/9-june/gazette/no-faffing-about-by-feoffees|title=No faffing about by Feoffees|date=2 November 2006|work=Church Times|publisher=Church Times|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]], the Feoffees of the Grammar School have been trustees of a piece of land donated for the use of the town since the 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.town.ipswich.ma.us/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=321&amp;Itemid=474|title=New Feoffees|last=Anon|work=Town of Ipswich|publisher=Town of Ipswich|accessdate=6 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209011302/http://www.town.ipswich.ma.us/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=321&amp;Itemid=474|archivedate=9 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the village of Ecclesfield, South Yorkshire, the feoffees contribute to looking after the fabric of the church, [[Church of St Mary, Ecclesfield]] and also make other donations for the benefit of the local population but in the past they used to have responsibility for law and order, punishment of the guilty and upkeep of the roads.

The '''Food Additives Amendment of 1958''' is a 1958 amendment to the United States' [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Food, Drugs, and Cosmetic Act of 1938]]. It was a response to concerns about the safety of new food additives. The amendment established an exemption from the "food additive" definition and requirements for substances "[[generally recognized as safe]]" by scientific experts in the field, based on long history of use before 1958 or based on scientific studies. New food additives would be subject to testing including by the "Delaney clause". The Delaney clause was a provision in the amendment which said that if a substance were found to cause cancer in man or animal, then it could not be used as a [[food additive]].

=="Generally recognized as safe"==
{{main|Generally recognized as safe}}
Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) is a [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) designation that a chemical or substance added to food is considered safe by experts, and so is exempted from the usual [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] (FFDCA) food additive tolerance requirements.&lt;ref name="GRASfda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GRAS/ucm2006850.htm|title=Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of food additives being "generally recognized as safe" was first described in the Food Additives Amendment of 1958, and all additives introduced after this time had to be evaluated by new standards.

==Delaney Clause==
The Delaney Clause is a [[Provision (contracting)|provision]] in the amendment named after Congressman [[James J. Delaney|James Delaney]] of New York. 
It said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the Secretary of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] shall not approve for use in food any chemical additive found to induce cancer in man, or, after tests, found to induce cancer in animals.&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;Merrill, Richard A. "Food Safety Regulation: Reforming the Delaney Clause" in ''Annual Review of Public Health'', 1997, 18:313-40.[http://aseh.net/teaching-research/teaching-unit-better-living-through-chemistry/historical-sources/lesson-2/Merrill-Food%20Safety%20Regulation-1997.pdf] This source includes a useful historical survey of prior food safety regulation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Delaney Clause applied to [[pesticide]]s in [[processed food]]s, but only when the concentration of a residue of a cancer-causing pesticide increased during processing; for example when more of a pesticide was present in [[ketchup]] than in the raw tomatoes used to make it. (It never applied to pesticides in raw foods.) When the law was passed, "neither advocates nor opponents of the policy, including FDA officials, believed it would have broad application, for only a handful of chemicals had then been shown to be animal [[carcinogen]]s."&lt;ref name=Merrill /&gt;

The Delaney Clause was invoked in 1959 when [[Arthur Sherwood Flemming]], the Secretary of the [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] issued a statement advising the public about the possible contamination of substantial quantities of cranberries in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] with the [[herbicide]] [[aminotriazole]], which the FDA had recently determined was a carcinogen (see [[Arthur Sherwood Flemming#Cranberry scare of 1959|Cranberry scare of 1959]]). Taking place the week of [[Thanksgiving]], the announcement was referred to by many in the cranberry industry as "Black Monday" − sales plummeted, even though many government officials attempted to defuse the [[health scare|scare]] by declaring their intention to eat cranberries anyway. This episode is regarded as one of the first modern food scares based on a chemical additive.

As [[analytical chemistry]] became more powerful and able to detect smaller quantities of chemicals, and as chemicals became more widely used, regulatory agencies had an increasingly difficult time administering the Delaney Clause as it "recognizes no distinctions based on carcinogenic [[Potency (pharmacology)|potency]] and, at least in theory, it applies equally to additives used in large amounts and to those present at barely detectable levels. It thus takes no account of the actual risk a carcinogenic additive might pose."&lt;ref name=Merrill /&gt;

The FDA was the first agency to have to confront this problem, with respect to the use of [[diethylstilbestrol]] to promote the growth of livestock used in meat production, which remained present in the meat. It addressed the issue by using quantitative [[risk assessment]], declaring that if a carcinogenic food additive was present at a concentration of less than 1 part in 1,000,000, the risk was negligible. This standard became known as the "[[de minimis]]" exception to the Delaney Rule and was used throughout the FDA and other agencies.&lt;ref name=Merrill /&gt;

In 1988 the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] eased restrictions on several pesticides which posed a "de minimis" risk to humans. This change was challenged by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], and overturned in 1992 by the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]].

Pesticide use was removed from the Delaney Clause in 1996 by an amendment to Title IV of the [[Food Quality Protection Act of 1996]] (P.L. 104-170, Sec. 404).

The Delaney prohibition appears in three separate parts of the FFDCA: Section 409 on food additives; Section 512, relating to animal drugs in meat and poultry; and Section 721 on color additives. The Section 409 prohibition applied to many pesticide residues until enactment of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. This legislation removed pesticide residue tolerances from Delaney Clause constraints.

Many foods contain natural substances which are carcinogenic, for example [[safrole]], which occurs in [[sassafras]] and sweet [[basil]]. Even these substances are covered by the Delaney clause, so that, for example, safrole may not be added to [[root beer]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fennema, Owen R. |title=Food chemistry |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York, N.Y |year=1996 |page=827 |isbn=0-8247-9691-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GERB''' ({{lang-bg|ГЕРБ}}, Граждани за европейско развитие на България, "Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria") is a [[conservative]],&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt; [[Populism|populist]]&lt;ref name="FT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WP1"/&gt; [[List of political parties in Bulgaria|Bulgarian political party]] established on 13 March 2006. The initials of the party ''[[wikt:герб|герб]]/gerb'' also translate as "[[coat of arms]]" in Bulgarian. It is Bulgaria's second-largest party by membership.&lt;ref name="24chasa"/&gt;

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
GERB is headed by [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria]] [[Boyko Borisov]], former [[List of mayors of Sofia|mayor of Sofia]], former member of the [[National Movement Simeon II]], former personal guard of [[Todor Zhivkov]] in the 90s of the last century. They were close friends. The establishment of the party followed the creation of a non-profit organization with the [[acronym]] (in Bulgarian) GERB&amp;nbsp;— ''Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria'', earlier the same year. The name of the party is not stated to be an acronym, but is spelled in [[all caps]] nonetheless.

In early January 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/14267 |title=Socialists Lead GERB in Bulgarian Politics: Angus Reid Global Monitor |work=Angus Reid Public Opinion |publisher=Vision Critical |accessdate=October 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708093638/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/14267 |archivedate=July 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and early February 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/14698 |title=Socialists Gain, GERB Second in Bulgaria: Angus Reid Global Monitor |work=Angus Reid Public Opinion |publisher=Vision Critical |accessdate=October 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002010621/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/14698 |archivedate=October 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the party came second in [[opinion poll|public polls]] on party support with around 14%, trailing the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] which had around 25%. Its stated priorities are fighting crime and corruption, preserving [[family values|family as the cornerstone of society]] and achieving [[Energy development#Resilience|energy independence]].

GERB won the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Bulgaria)|2009 European Parliament election in Bulgaria]] with 24.36% of the vote. The party elected five [[Members of the European Parliament|MEPs]] and joined the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party-European Democrats Group]] in the [[European Parliament]] (in the [[European People's Party|EPP]] section). On June 6, 2007 GERB applied formally to join as a member-party the [[European People's Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gerb-bg.com/index1.php?menu=news&amp;id_news=50 |title=Лидерът на ПП ГЕРБ е на двудневно посещение в Брюксел |date=June 6, 2007 |work=ГЕРБ |language=Bulgarian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235516/http://gerb-bg.com/index1.php?menu=news&amp;id_news=50 |archivedate=September 26, 2007 |accessdate=October 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined EPP on February 7, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bulgaria's GERB joins European People's Party |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2008/02/08/nb-06 |newspaper=SEtimes.com |date=February 8, 2008 |accessdate=October 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GERB won the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2009|2009 parliamentary elections]], held a month after the European ballot, winning 39.7% of the popular vote and 117 seats (out of 240). After the elections, a new government was formed, [[First Borisov Government|led by Borisov]], primarily with GERB members and with 5 independent ministers around Deputy Prime Minister [[Simeon Djankov]]. The reformist wing was responsible for some of the most significant legislative victories, including a Constitutional reform to ban tax increases. On 20 February 2013, the government resigned after [[2013 Bulgarian protests against the Borisov cabinet|nationwide protests]] demanding it to step down.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|last=New York Times|first=The|title=After Bulgarian Protests, Prime Minister Resigns|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/world/europe/bulgarian-government-is-reported-set-to-resign.html?_r=0|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GERB's candidates for the [[Bulgarian presidential election, 2011|2011 presidential election]], [[Rosen Plevneliev]] and [[Margarita Popova]] (presidential nominee and running mate, respectively), won the elections on the second ballot with 52.6% of the popular vote.

GERB won the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2013|2013 parliamentary elections]] with 97 seats, receiving 30.5% of the popular vote. This made GERB the first governing party to be re-elected in the history of the post-communist Bulgaria. However, with lack of support from the other parties and designated to form a new government, Borisov refused the offer and so GERB went in the opposition. However, due to the collapse of the coalition government in 2014, GERB backed into power after the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2014|snap elections]].

'''''Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning''''' (''GHT'') was a daily [[newspaper]] published in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]], from 1832 to 1985. 

==History and profile==
''GHT'' was founded in 1832 by publisher [[Magnus Prytz]] and had a liberal alignment from the later part of the 19th century after [[Sven Adolf Hedlund]] became [[Editing|editor]] in 1852.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;John Solheim: [http://snl.no/G%C3%B6teborgs_Handels-_och_Sj%C3%B6farts-Tidning Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfarts-Tidning] {{no icon}} ''[[Store norske leksikon]]'', Retrieved 30 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The author [[Viktor Rydberg]] worked for the newspaper and several of his novels were published as series in the paper.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

During [[World War II]], ''GHT'' was one of few Swedish newspapers that held a decidedly anti-[[Nazism|Nazi]] profile, which made its [[Editor-in-chief|editor in chief]] (since 1917) [[Torgny Segerstedt]] a controversial figure in neutral Sweden. The Norwegian illustrator [[Ragnvald Blix]] became known for his anti-Nazi caricatures published in the paper during that time under the pseudonym "Stig Höök".&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; The paper ceased publication in 1985 (but was only published weekly 1973-1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Håkan Lindgren|title=On Virgin Soil.

'''Historiography in the Republic of Macedonia''' is the methodology of historical studies used by the historians in the country. It has been developed since 1991 when the republic proclaimed its independence. According to [[Stefan Troebst]] it has preserved nearly the same agenda as the [[marxist historiography]] from the times of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Troebst, Historical Politics and Historical 'Masterpieces' in Macedonia before and after 1991, [http://www.newbalkanpolitics.org.mk/item/Historical-Politics-and-Historical-%E2%80%9CMasterpieces%E2%80%9D-in-Macedonia-before-and-after-1991#.Wz5pB9UzYdU New Balkan Politics, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in the field of historiography, [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav communism]] and Macedonian nationalism are closely related.&lt;ref&gt;Roumen Daskalov, Diana Mishkova as ed., Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume Two: Transfers of Political Ideologies and Institutions, BRILL, 2013, {{ISBN|9004261915}}, p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ulf Brunnbauer]], modern Macedonian historiography is highly politicized, because the Macedonian nation-building process is still in development. There is no place of diverging approaches in it for several reasons as economic limitations;  failure of academic career and stigmatization as “national traitor”.&lt;ref&gt;Ulf Brunnbauer,  “Serving the Nation: Historiography in the Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) after Socialism“, Historien, Vol. 4 (2003-4), [http://history-of-macedonia.com/2009/11/28/historiography-in-fyrom-nationalism-myth-creations-and-nation-building/ pp. 174-175.]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently a [[nation-building]] project has been promoted to impose the deceptive idea, Macedonian nation is the oldest on the Balkans, with unbroken continuity from the antiquity to the modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Roth, Asker Kartarı as authors and ed., Cultures of Crisis in Southeast Europe, Volume 2, LIT Verlag Münster, 2017, {{ISBN|3643907915}}, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Some domestic and foreign scholars have criticized this agenda, leading to the creation of a [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|denialist historiography]], whose goal has been to affirm the continuous existence of a separate Macedonian nation throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Sinisa Jakov Marusic, New Statue Awakens Past Quarrels in Macedonia. BalkanInsight, 13 July 2012, cited in War in the Balkans: Conflict and Diplomacy before World War I by James Pettifer, I.B.Tauris, 2015, {{ISBN|0857739689}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This controversial masterpiece is [[ahistorical]], as it projects modern ethnic distinctions into the past.&lt;ref&gt;Kyril Drezov, Macedonian identity: an overview of the major claims in The New Macedonian Question with J. Pettifer as ed., Springer, 1999, {{ISBN|0230535798}}, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an enhanced, [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] reading of history contributes to the distortion of the Macedonian national identity and degrades history as an academic discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Irena Stefoska, Nation, Education and Historiographic Narratives: the Case of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia (1944-1990); Introduction In discussions of identities (ethnic, national, religious, gender, etc.), Fragments of the History of Macedonian Nationalism: An Introduction to the Research Problem, pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The contemporary Macedonian historical narrative is rooted in [[IMRO (United)|communist groups]] active during the [[interwar period]], especially in the 1930s, when the Comintern issued a [[Resolution of the Comintern on the Macedonian Question|special resolution]] in their support. Those circles were however not the first ones to develop separate Macedonian historical interpretations. In 1892 [[Georgi Pulevski]], the first Macedonian national activist, completed a "General History of the Macedonian Slavs." It was only after the Second World War, however, that those writings were widely appreciated, as prior to the establishment of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], the existence of a separate [[Ethnic Macedonians|Macedonian nation]] was still not recognized. 

The gloriﬁcation of the Yugoslav Partisan movement became one of the main components of the post-war Yugoslav political propaganda. As result, the leader of the new [[SR Macedonia]] – [[Lazar Koliševski]], initially proclaimed that its history has begun with the start of the [[NLWM|communist struggle during the Second World War]], while early 20th century events and organizations as the [[Ilinden Uprising]] and the [[IMRO]] were mere Bulgarian conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;Мичев. Д. Македонският въпрос и българо-югославските отношения&amp;nbsp;– 9 септември 1944–1949, Издателство: СУ Св. Кл. Охридски, 1992, стр. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Initially the membership in the IMRO was restricted only for Bulgarians. Its first name was "Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees", which was later changed several times. IMRO was active not only in Macedonia but also in [[Thrace]] (the [[Vilayet of Adrianople]]). Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria, these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography. They suggest that IMRO revolutionaries in the Ottoman period did not differentiate between ‘Macedonians’ and ‘Bulgarians’. Moreover, as their own writings attest, they often saw themselves and their compatriots as ‘Bulgarians’. All of them wrote in standard Bulgarian language. For more see: ''Brunnbauer, Ulf (2004) Historiography, Myths and the Nation in the Republic of Macedonia. In: Brunnbauer, Ulf, (ed.) (Re)Writing History. Historiography in Southeast Europe after Socialism. Studies on South East Europe, vol. 4. LIT, Münster, pp. 165-200 {{ISBN|382587365X}}.''&lt;/ref&gt; Following direct political instructions from Belgrade, those historical studies were expanded.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Troebst, “Die bulgarisch-jugoslawische Kontroverse um Makedonien 1967-1982”. R. Oldenbourg, 1983, {{ISBN|3486515217}}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; New Macedonian historiography held, as a central principle, that Macedonian history was distinctively different from that of [[Bulgaria]]. Its primary goal was to create a separate Macedonian national consciousness, with “anti-Bulgarian" or "de-Bulgarizing" trend, and to sever any ties to Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Palmer, Robert R. King, Yugoslav communism and the Macedonian question, Archon Books, 1971, {{ISBN|0208008217}}, pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinct Slavic consciousness would inspire identification with [[Yugoslavia]].
[[File:Bitolski nadpis.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The [[Bitola inscription]] from 1016/1017 when the town served as capital of Bulgaria. Originally exhibited in the local museum, it was locked away when Bulgarian scientists became aware of its content, confirming the [[Cometopuli]] considered their state Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;J. Pettifer ed., The New Macedonian Question, St Antony's Series, Springer, 1999, {{ISBN|0230535798}}, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The first national scientific institution in this field – the Institute for National History of the [[Federated state|federate republic]] was established in 1948. The historiographic narrative in the first two decades afterwards was expanded to the early 19th century, in which, as it was believed then, was launched the history of the Macedonian people. However the  personalities from the area included into the new masterpiece, played also significant role in the [[Bulgarian National Revival]]. Numerous prominent activists with [[Bulgarophiles|pro-Bulgarian]] sentiments from the 19th and the early 20th centuries were described as (Ethnic) Macedonians. Because in many documents of that period, the local Slavic population is not referred to as "Macedonian" but as "Bulgarian", Macedonian historians argue that it was Macedonian, regardless of what is written in the records. They have claimed also that "Bulgarian" at that time was a term, not related to any ethnicity, but was used as a synonym for "Slavic", "Christian" or "peasant".&lt;ref&gt;Blaze Ristovski, Istorija na makedonskata nacija [History of the Macedonian Nation], Skopje, 1969, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Efforts were made since the late 1960s to include there also the Middle Ages. As result in 1969, the first academic "History of the Macedonian nation" was published, where many historical figures from the area, who lived in the last millennium as [[Samuel of Bulgaria]], were described as people with "Macedonian (Slavic) identity". When the historians from the [[Skopje University]] published in 1985 their collection with documents on the struggle of the Macedonian people, they included into the excerpts of the medieval chronicles, a footnote for every use of the term [[Bulgaria]]n.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Kostov, Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996, Peter Lang, 2010, {{ISBN|3034301960}}, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all of the new historical agenda was traditionally claimed by the Bulgarian national historiography and till today it disputes the Macedonian historical readings.&lt;ref&gt;Tchavdar Marinov, Historiographical Revisionism and Re-Articulation of Memory in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Sociétés politiques comparées, issue 25, May 2010, [http://www.fasopo.org/sites/default/files/article_n25.pdf p. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;

== After independence ==

[[File:Ustavmakodr.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The statute of the [[IMRO]] from the eve of the 20th century. Its membership then was restricted only for Bulgarians. For that reason most of today Macedonian historians reject its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Mishkova Diana as ed., We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe, Central European University Press, 2009, ISBN 9639776289, [https://books.google.bg/books?id=pbi_wzu7QAMC&amp;dq=party+bulgarian+section+1909+sandanski+statute&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s pp. 113-114.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After the [[Republic of Macedonia]] gained independence in the late 20th century, the picture has not changed significantly. Macedonian historiography has not revised much of the Yugoslav past, because almost all of its historical myths were constructed during the [[communist era]]. The reluctance for a thorough reevaluation of Yugoslav communist historiography was mainly caused by the fact that the very Macedonian nation, state and language were a result of Yugoslav communist policies, where this historiography had played a crucial role. For the mainstream local establishment, an attitude against Communist Yugoslavia is seen as anti-[[Macedonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulf Brunnbauer, “Pro‐Serbians” vs. “Pro‐Bulgarians”: Revisionism in Post‐Socialist Macedonian Historiography, first published on 21 December 2005  https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00130.x &lt;/ref&gt; 

Macedonian historiography became urgent in the early 21st century in the face of an unsure reevaluation of the Yugoslav past and of an uneasy articulation of a new anticommunist narrative. It has sought a new horizon behind the mythological symbolism of [[ancient Macedon]]. For that purpose the borders of the ancient entity were extended towards the north, much further than the borders of the historical state. According to this history, most of the cultural achievements of the Ancient Macedonians were actually (ethnic) Macedonian and therefore, [[Hellenistic period|Hellenism]]'s true name would be [[Macedonism]]. This new historical trend is called [[antiquization]], making the Macedonian nationality a thousand years older. In this narrative [[Ancient Macedonians]] were not [[Ancient Greek]] people and it maintains a separate existence of Ancient Macedonians in the [[Early Middle Ages]], 800 years after the fall of the their kingdom, as well as, their admixture in the [[Byzantine Empire]], with the arriving at that time [[early Slavic]] migrants.

In 2009 the first [[Macedonian Encyclopedia]] was issued by the [[Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. The issuance of the encyclopaedia caused  international and internal protest because of its content and its authors have been subjected to severe criticism. Even some Macedonian academics criticised the book as hastily prepared and politically motivated. Soon the scandalous encyclopaedia  was withdrawn from the bookstores. [[Macedonian Canadian]] historian [[Andrew Rossos]] has published in 2008 the first professional English language overview of the history of Macedonia, however Stefan Troebst suggests that his narrative is enough affected by the views in the R. Macedonia and thus is representing the latest developments in the Macedonian historiography as viewed in Skopje.

== Alternative views==
After the [[fall of Communism]], [[Historical revisionism|historical revisionists]] in the Republic of Macedonia questioned the narrative established in Communist Yugoslavia. People such as [[Ivan Mikulčić]], [[Zoran Todorovski]] and [[Slavko Milosavlevski]] tried to openly oppose to popular historical myths in the Republic of Macedonia. Mikulčić for example, proved through archaeological evidence that there weren't any ancient Macedonians when the Early Slavs arrived in Macedonia. He also found several [[Bulgars]]' settlements on the territory of the modern republic and argued the Slavs in Macedonia adopted the [[ethnonym]] ''Bulgarians'' in the 9th century. Todorovski has argued that all Macedonian revolutionaries from the early 20th century and beyond identified themselves as Bulgarians. Milosavlevski challenged the myth of the significant communists partisans resistance movement against the Bulgarian "''fascistic occupiers''" during the [[Second World War]]. Their studies became only exception for the new Macedonian historiography and most historians left loyal to the political elite with publications appropriating the Hellenistic part from the Macedonian past and that of the medieval [[Bulgarian Empire]] and Bulgarian national revival from the Ottoman period. 

The policy to claim Ethnic Macedonian past during Ancient, Medieval and Ottoman times, is facing criticism by other academics and politicians in the country itself, as [[Denko Maleski]], [[Miroslav Grčev]], [[Ljubcho Georgievski]] and others. It demonstrates feebleness of archaeology and historiography, as well some kind of ethnic marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;Ludomir R. Lozny (2011). Comparative Archaeologies: A Sociological View of the Science of the Past. Springer, {{ISBN|1441982248}}, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; These intellectuals from Macedonian elite, admit the distinct Macedonian nation is a recent phenomenon developed in the years around the Second World War. Such views are spread among  well educated citizens that search for the scientific resolution of the nation-building problematic. Despite the leading establishment strongly opposes the articulation of such views, some prominent members of the elite disclose their rational views.

==Foreign historiographic studies ==
The mainstream European historiography maintains the idea of separate Macedonian nation was developed mainly during the Second World War and was adopted en masse immediately after it.&lt;ref&gt;Naoum Kaytschev, Being Macedonian: different types of ethnic identifications in the contemporary  Republic of Macedonia. No. 30, Macedonia in 20th and 21st century (2014), pp. 123-132, Księgarnia Akademicka, URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/24919720 .&lt;/ref&gt; Whether in antiquity the [[Ancient Macedonians]] were originally a Greek tribe or not, is ultimately a redundant question, claims [[Loring Danforth]], while with the ongoing [[hellenization]] of Macedonia, they came to be regarded as "northern Greeks".&lt;ref&gt;Danforth, Loring M. (1997). The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World. Princeton, Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-04356-6}}, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Van Antwerp Fine]] states that throughout the Middle ages and Ottoman era today Bulgarians and Macedonians comprised a single people.&lt;ref&gt;John Van Antwerp Fine, "The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century"; University of Michigan Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0472081497}}, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Per [[Bernard Lory]] the ethnic divergence between them occurred mainly in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lory, The Bulgarian-Macedonian Divergence, An Attempted Elucidation, INALCO, Paris in Developing Cultural Identity in the Balkans: Convergence Vs. Divergence with Raymond Detrez and Pieter Plas as ed., Peter Lang, 2005, {{ISBN|9052012970}},  pp. 165-193.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Maxwell (historian)|Alexander Maxwell]] maintains that scarcely by the middle of that century, Macedonians began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Maxwell, Slavic Macedonian Nationalism: From "Regional" to "Ethnic"' in Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Part 1. with Klaus Roth and Ulf Brunnbauer as ed., LIT, Münster, 2008. {{ISBN|3825813878}}, pp. 127-154.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Eugene N. Borza]], the Macedonians, who are recently emergent people, and have had no history, are in search of their past. This search is an attempt to help legitimize their unsure present, surviving in the disorder of the Balkan politics.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene N. Borza, Macedonia Redux in The Eye Expanded: Life and the Arts in Greco-Roman Antiquity with Frances B. Titchener, and Richard F. Moorton as ed. University of California Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0520210298}}, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivaylo Dichev]] claims that the Macedonian historiography has the impossible task of filling the huge gaps between the ancient kingdom of Macedon, that collapsed in 2th cent. BC, the 10th-11th cent. state of the [[Cometopuls]], and the [[Yugoslav Macedonia]] established in the middle of the 20th cent.&lt;ref&gt;Dichev, Ivaylo, Eros Identiteta, In: Dušan Bjelić, Obrad Savić (eds.), Balkan kao metafora: između globalizacije i fragmentacije. Beograd: Beogradski krug, 2003, pp. 269-284.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the myths of national purity and continuity that came to dominate the official Macedonian historiography, what is usual on the Balkans, [[Ipek Yosmaoglu]] affirms there is not much to be gained from a search for Macedonian national lineage, because the Macedonian nationhood was shaped mainly in the decades following World War II.&lt;ref&gt;İpek Yosmaoğlu, Blood Ties: Religion, Violence and the Politics of Nationhood in Ottoman Macedonia, 1878–1908, Cornell University Press, 2013, {{ISBN|0801469791}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent development ==
Surveys on the effects of the controversial [[nation-building]] project [[Skopje 2014]] on the perceptions of the population of Skopje revealed a high degree of uncertainty regarding its national identity. Following the results of a supplementary national poll they show that there is a great discrepancy between the population’s sentiment and the narrative the state seeks to promote.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[F.A.K. Yasamee]] the Macedonians are a striking instance of the mutability of national identity.&lt;ref&gt;F.A.K. Yasamee, Nationality in the Balkans: The case of the Macedonians in Balkans: A Mirror of the New World Order, Istanbul: EREN, 1995; pp. 121-132.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Skopje on November 13, 1944.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Bulgarian forces entering [[Skopje]] in November 1944 after the ejection of the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Steve. The Eastern Front Day by Day, 1941-45: A Photographic Chronology, Potomac Books, 2006, {{ISBN|1597970107}}, p. 170: "November 13, 1944, ''...The Bulgarian First Army ejects Army Group E from Skopje...''"&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonian sources claim no Bulgarian troops participated in the capture of the city, even as observers.&lt;ref&gt;Livanios, Dimitris, The Macedonian Question: Britain and the Southern Balkans 1939-1949, Oxford University Publishing, 2008, {{ISBN|0191528722}}, pp. 134-135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palairet, Macedonia: A Voyage through History (Vol. 2), Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016, {{ISBN|1443888494}}, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Recently Macedonian political elite seems interested in some debates about the national historical narrative with Bulgaria and Greece. With respect to the Macedonian narrative, both Greek and Bulgarian historiography have questioned its factual basis, because it was constructed to come into conflict with these older historiographies. Per [[Michael R. Palairet]] in the three-way dispute about Macedonia, the Bulgarian view is closer to the objective facts of the history than either the Greek or Macedonian, but the Macedonian historiographical version violates common sense and the historical record much more than the Bulgarian or the Greek ones.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palairet, Macedonia: A Voyage through History (Vol. 1, From Ancient Times to the Ottoman Invasions), Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016, {{ISBN|1443888435}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The governments of Bulgaria and Macedonia signed a friendship treaty to bolster the complicated relations between the two Balkan states in August 2017. On its ground a joint commission on historical and educational issues was formed in 2018. This intergovernmental commission is a forum where controversial historical issues will be raised and discussed, to resolve the problematic readings of history. In June 2018, [[Greece]] and Macedonia also signed an agreement to end [[Macedonia naming dispute|their long disputes]], which would result in Macedonia being renamed the Republic of North Macedonia. It also provides for the creation of a "historical" commission similar to that of the treaty signed with [[Bulgaria]]. 

However with nationalism in three countries rising, there are still Greek and Bulgarian scholars to attempt to claim a Macedonian nation did not exist until middle of the 20th. century and therefore, it could not exist at the present. In Skopje, meanwhile, there are growing concerns, that the negotiations with the country’s neighbors over its history, may jeopardize the Macedonian government or, even lead to violence and internal clashes.

'''Left Unity''' is a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom|political party in the United Kingdom]] founded in 2013 when film director [[Ken Loach]] appealed for a new party to replace the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] (which according to him failed to oppose [[austerity]] and had shifted towards [[neoliberalism]]).&lt;ref name=LoachGuardian&gt;{{cite web|title=The Labour party has failed us. We need a new party of the left|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/25/labour-party-left|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=4 December 2013|date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seymour|first1=Richard|title=Left Unity: A Report From The Founding Conference|url=http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/article_comments/left_unity_a_report_from_the_founding_conference|website=newleftproject.org|publisher=New Left Project|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpmSDc1nBvE |title=RT News reports on Left Unity's founding conference |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 10,000 people supported Loach's appeal.&lt;ref name=LoachHuffpost&gt;{{cite web|title=Ken Loach Discusses His Hopes for Left Unity|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/salman-shaheen/ken-loach-left-unity_b_4302871.html|publisher=The Huffington Post UK|accessdate=4 December 2013|date=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the party had 2,000 members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New party Left Unity to hold first annual conference|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29799731|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=6 March 2015|date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 70 branches across Britain.&lt;ref name="LU conference"&gt;{{cite web|title=Left Unity conference – some important steps forward and challenges still ahead|url=http://socialistresistance.org/6911/left-unity-conference-some-important-steps-forward-and-challenges-still-ahead|publisher=Socialist Resistance|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation is affiliated at the [[European Union]] level with the [[Party of the European Left]].

=={{anchor|Party views}}Ideology==
The party's primary aim is the followig:
{{quote|[...] unite the diverse strands of radical and socialist politics in the UK including workers' organisations and trade unions; ordinary people, grass root organisations and co-operatives rooted in our neighbourhoods and communities; individuals and communities facing poverty, discrimination and social oppression because of gender, ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality, unemployment or under-employment; environmental and green campaigners; campaigners for freedom and democracy; all those who seek to authentically voice and represent the interests of ordinary working people.|Left Unity|Party constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution|url=http://leftunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Constitution-as-of-7-12-13.pdf|website=leftunity.org|publisher=Left Unity|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Left Unity was founded by [[Ken Loach]], who believed that there was an "absence of a strong voice on the left" and that "[[Green Party of England and Wales|the Greens]] are alone among the political parties in not standing up for the interests of big business". Loach wanted a "[[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] of the left", "a successful party to the left of Labour as UKIP appears to be a successful party to the right of the Tories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shaheen|first1=Salman|title=Ken Loach Discusses His Hopes for Left Unity|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/salman-shaheen/ken-loach-left-unity_b_4302871.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|publisher=Huffington Post|date=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Economy}}Economics===
Left Unity is an [[anti-capitalist]] party, firmly opposed to "[[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity programmes]] which make the mass of working people, the old, the young and the sick, pay for a systemic crisis of [[capitalism]]" and believes that such measures protect bankers and not ordinary people.&lt;ref name="founding statements"&gt;{{cite web|title=Left Unity - Founding Statements|url=http://leftunity.org/founding-conference-decisions-1/|website=leftunity.org|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Loach, "an anti-austerity alliance is good, but the problem with [the [[Scottish National Party]], [[Plaid Cymru]] and [[Green Party of England and Wales|the Green Party]] is that] they're mainly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties". Nick Eardley wrote for BBC News: "Parties like his are needed to peddle a more radical message".&lt;ref name=2015Elections/&gt;

Left Unity wants to end [[zero-hour contract]]s and the [[privatisation]] of public services in education and health. The party advocates common ownership and democratic control of "the means of producing wealth" and the reversal of what it sees as 30 years of [[neoliberalism]], aiming to "build international networks of solidarity to support any government introducing such measures within Europe and elsewhere".&lt;ref name=economics&gt;{{cite web|title=Left Unity - Economics Policy|url=http://leftunity.org/economics-policy/|website=leftunity.org|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supports full employment "through measures such as reduced working hours for all; spending on public housing, infrastructure and services; and the public ownership of, and democratic collective control over, basic utilities, transport systems and the financial sector" and opposes "the [[wikt:casualization|casualization]] of employment conditions and laws which restrict the right of workers to organise effectively and take [[industrial action]]".&lt;ref name="founding statements"/&gt;

The party has been criticised by far-left political organisations who say that the party has a "commitment to govern within the framework of capitalism" and its economic programme "is a left-Keynesian, reformist programme, which would leave more than half of the [[FTSE 100]] companies still in private hands, despite phrases in it about a "strategic vision of structural change" and the principle "[[from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs]]", lifted from the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]''".&lt;ref name = "Report Left Unity"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yorke|first1=Andy|title=Report of Left Unity Policy Conference 29 March|url=http://www.workerspower.co.uk/2014/04/report-of-left-unity-policy-conference-29-march/|publisher=Workers' Power|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Left Unity's 2014 constitution, the party aims to build a society with (at least in the medium term) a private sector within the framework of a radical Left National Plan. In 2014, the organisation was committed to a [[Mixed economy|mixed economic structure]], stressing the need for "a democratically planned economy that is environmentally sustainable, within which all enterprises, whether privately owned, co-operatives, or under public ownership, operate in ways that promote the needs of the people and wider society".&lt;ref&gt;Left Unity 2014 Constitution, section 2) b), Aims.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 pre-general election Left Unity manifesto appears instead to pursue a more [[far-left]] line and refers to the needs for an economy "run democratically, not controlled by the few in the interests of 1% of the population. This means the principle of common ownership of all natural resources and means of producing wealth".&lt;ref&gt;2015 Left Unity Election  Manifesto, Economy section.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Loach, {{as of|2015|alt=the party supports a £10 [[minimum wage]]}} and wishes to [[wikt:emulate|emulate]] "the kind of economy that [[Syriza]] in Greece and [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in Spain are calling for".&lt;ref name=2015Elections&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eardley|first1=Nick|title=Election 2015: Ken Loach launches 'radical' Left Unity manifesto|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32128790|website=BBC.co.uk|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 April 2015|date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing===
{{as of|2015|alt=Left Unity opposes}} the [[bedroom tax]], the [[Right to Buy]] and other sales of social homes. Left Unity would [[History of rent control in England and Wales|reintroduce rent controls]] and [[security of tenure]], using compulsory purchase powers to take over empty homes and end the criminalisation of [[squatting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Liz|title=Political Parties: The Housing Crisis|url=https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-f7ff-POLITICAL-PARTIES-THE-HOUSING-CRISIS#.WFUJ2YXXKP8|accessdate=17 December 2016|work=[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|The Morning Star]]|date=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmentalism===
Left Unity calls their party "red and green", with "red" referring to [[left-wing politics]] and "green" to [[environmentalism]]. The party believes that capitalism ignores the [[ecosystem]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ecological devastation, resulting from the insatiable need to increase profits, is not an accidental feature of capitalism: it is built into the system’s DNA and cannot be reformed away. Capitalism is increasingly demonstrating its total incompatibility with the maintenance of our ecosystem through its ruthless exploitation of ever scarcer natural resources, its pollution of the environment, the growing loss of biological and agricultural diversity and increasing climate change....
When the politicians propose using market mechanisms to limit carbon emissions, it is clear that they cannot see a more democratic or sane way out of the climate crisis. International policies like carbon "cap and trade" that allow companies to buy the "rights" to pollute, or an ecotax that end up punishing the poor, are all measures that will not work in the long term to save the planet – instead giving the rich and powerful nations and individuals the right to continue to pollute legally.
Climate change is now inevitable, the question is how much and for how long and how much damage will it do. For us, socialism is the best way to manage the resources of the planet and ensure their democratic distribution in such a way that we are not destroying the environment to make a profit – as the corporations and energy companies are. No more "business as usual" means ending business as the driving force of the economy and instead looking to human – and environmental – need not corporate greed. If we want to save the planet we need socialism and we need it soon.&lt;ref name="Environment Policy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Left Unity - Environment policy|url=http://leftunity.org/environment-policy/|website=leftunity.org|publisher=Left Unity|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Equality===
Left Unity is [[anti-racist]], pro-{{abbr|LGBT rights|lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights}}, [[feminist]], opposes [[religious discrimination]] and [[ableism]] and supports the rights of [[asylum seekers]] and "all those in need".&lt;ref name="founding statements"/&gt; Left Unity's position on [[safe space]]s has been criticised by some on the left and a draft amendment was proposed by the Communist Platform of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Macnair|first1=Mike|title=Left unity: Safe spaces are not liberating - Weekly Worker|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1012/left-unity-safe-spaces-are-not-liberating/|accessdate=16 December 2016|work=[[Weekly Worker]]|issue=1012|publisher=[[Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)|CPGB (PCC)]]|date=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Macnair|first1=Mike|title=‘Speaking bitterness’ and Left Unity|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1015/speaking-bitterness-and-left-unity/|accessdate=16 December 2016|work=[[Weekly Worker]]|issue=1015|publisher=[[Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)|CPGB (PCC)]]|date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====LGBT equality and feminism====
The party has been defined as a "radical socialist party with strong positions on ecology and feminism" and "has a commitment to women comprising at least 50% of its leadership". Speeches deemed as supporting [[male privilege]] have been received negatively and it is claimed that "Left Unity is set to be a self-consciously feminist organisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Left Unity Launched|url=http://socialistresistance.org/5678/left-unity-launched|publisher=Socialist Resistance|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immigration and xenophobia====
Left Unity is opposed to xenophobia&lt;ref name="Playing it safe"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Demarty|first1=Paul|title=Left Unity: Playing it safe|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/977/left-unity-playing-it-safe/|publisher=Weekly Worker|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Luke Cooper of the Anticapitalist Initiative introduced socialist policies on immigration and racism. According to Cooper, there is no non-racist immigration control:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Left Unity completely rejects all anti-immigration arguments and rhetoric. We believe mass migration has had, and always will have, an overwhelmingly positive impact on society... challenge[s] ideas in the labour movement, and even sections of the socialist movement, that openly support or implicitly endorse the idea of "British Jobs for British Workers". Immigration controls divide and weaken the working class and [are] therefore against the interests of all workers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The party overwhelmingly voted in favour of this policy.&lt;ref name = "Report Left Unity"/&gt;

==={{anchor|The European Union}}European Union===
Left Unity has rejected left-wing [[Eurosceptic]] groups such as [[No2EU]],&lt;ref name = "Report Left Unity"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2009/03/10/exclusive-tommy-sheridan-to-stand-for-euro-elections-86908-21185994/ |title=Exclusive: Tommy Sheridan to stand for Euro elections |publisher=Daily Record |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2014-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111160344/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2009/03/10/exclusive-tommy-sheridan-to-stand-for-euro-elections-86908-21185994/ |archivedate=11 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a stance criticised by some other organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hyland|first1=Julie|title=Britain's Left Unity lays out its right-wing policies|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/04/14/left-a14.html|website=[[World Socialist Web Site]]|publisher=[[International Committee of the Fourth International]]|accessdate=7 March 2015|date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the organisation has allied itself with the [[pro-European]] Another Europe is Possible during the [[Campaigning in the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit referendum campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marsden|first1=Chris|title=Left Unity endorses pro-EU offensive to overturn Brexit referendum|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/07/09/left-j09.html|accessdate=17 December 2016|work=[[World Socialist Web Site]]|publisher=[[International Committee of the Fourth International]]|date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its conference in November 2015, the party adopted documents describing the EU as "a reactionary anti-working class unreformable institution", but recognising that the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]] "can only produce a reactionary exit that would benefit only the xenophobic right wing of the Tory party and of UKIP".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motions passed at Left Unity conference|url=http://leftunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Conference-motions-with-results.doc|publisher=Left Unity|accessdate=4 January 2016|pages=10|date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the party described the vote to leave the EU as "a disastrous outcome", saying the following:
{{quote|We deeply regret that the working people of Britain have been deceived and manipulated into believing that [[Brexit]] will bring about relief from the grinding austerity that is destroying lives and communities. We will now work tirelessly to oppose those who would divide us further. We will fight to defend the rights of working class communities and rebuild support for socialist ideas.|||Left Unity, quoted in ''[[Green Left Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Left Unity on 'Brexit' vote: 'A disastrous outcome'|url=https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/left-unity-brexit-vote-disastrous-outcome|accessdate=15 December 2016|work=[[Green Left Weekly]]|issue=1099|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Middle East===
The party "stands in solidarity with the Palestinian people in their struggle against oppression and dispossession". It supports the [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign, calls for the return of [[Palestinian refugees]] and "resolutely oppose[s] any expression of antisemitism, whether within the solidarity movement or elsewhere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minutes of November 2014 Conference|url=http://leftunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/minutes-final.doc|website=Left Unity|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
            
In 2014, Left Unity was criticised by media outlets worldwide after a motion that called [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] a "stabilising force" with "progressive potential" was proposed by two members at the party's annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic State's 'Progressive Potential' As 'Stabilising Force' Debated By New Left Unity Party|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/11/17/islamic-state-left-unity_n_6171252.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion received three votes (two from its proposers) and the conference overwhelmingly passed another motion that "the people of Syria including the Kurds of Syria have the right to defend themselves against the Assad regime and against ISIS.... ISIS is a reactionary and gruesome organisation which has caused suffering and death to the civilian populations of large parts of Syria and Iraq".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motions and amendments: record of outcomes|url=http://leftunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/minutes-final.doc|publisher=Left Unity|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Tummon, one of the proponents of the motion, later joined the Hazel Grove [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in March 2016.&lt;ref name="FisherTimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Lucy|title=Activist who defended Isis joins party|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4719350.ece|accessdate=15 December 2016|work=The Times|subscription=yes|date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its November 2015 conference, Left Unity agreed a motion condemning [[Russian military intervention in Syria|Russian attacks in Syria]], calling for an end to all foreign intervention and opposing any British military intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motions passed at Left Unity conference|url=http://leftunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Conference-motions-with-results.doc|publisher=Left Unity|accessdate=14 January 2016|pages=32|date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Socialist Network's Autumn 2014 Discussion Bulletin, it was then part of Left Unity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IS Network - Downloads|url=http://internationalsocialistnetwork.org/index.php/downloads|website=internationalsocialistnetwork.org|publisher=International Socialist Network|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with members elected to the party's national council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Admin|title=IS Network members standing in Left Unity National Council elections|url=http://internationalsocialistnetwork.org/index.php/ideas-and-arguments/organisation/left-unity/356-isn-members-standing-in-left-unity-national-council-elections|website=internationalsocialistnetwork.org|publisher=International Socialist Network|accessdate=3 March 2015|date=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)|CPGB (PCC)]] Communist Platform supporters within Left Unity (Jack Conrad and Yassamine Mather) announced that platform's dissolution on 20 February 2016 following Left Unity's refusal to accept their motion. The CPGB (PCC) issued a statement condemning Left Unity's support for [[Labourism]], [[Momentum (organisation)|Momentum]] and [[Jeremy Corbyn]], emphasising the need for "a real communist party", adding that by its "refusal to rethink its perspective [...] Left Unity has condemned itself to permanent irrelevance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why we're out of Left Unity|url=http://cpgb.org.uk/pages/news/100/why-were-out-of-left-unity/|accessdate=16 December 2016|work=CPGB (PCC)|date=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Left Unity is generally based on individual membership rather than organisational affiliation.&lt;ref name="HudsonLewis1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hudson|first1=Kate|last2=Lewis|first2=Ed|title=A New Party of the Left?|url=http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/article_comments/a_new_party_of_the_left|accessdate=15 December 2016|work=New Left Project|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral activity==

===2014 local elections===
In [[United Kingdom local elections, 2014|local elections on 22 May 2014]], Left Unity stood 11 candidates in four districts: [[Wigan]], [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]], [[Exeter]] and [[Norwich]]. They received 1,038 votes out of 74,126 cast, or an average of 3.2 percent.{{ref|nb1|[note 1]}} In Wigan West, party candidate Hazel Duffy received 8.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leftunity.org/local-election-results/|title=Local election results|publisher=Left Unity|date=23 May 2014|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left Unity had its first council seat in [[Stoke-on-Trent City Council election, 2010|Stoke-on-Trent]] between March and May 2015 after a councillor defected from the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Duncan|title=Stoke-on-Trent councillor Duncan Walker: why I left Labour and joined Left Unity|url=http://leftunity.org/stoke-on-trent-councillor-duncan-walker-why-i-left-labour-and-joined-left-unity/|publisher=Left Unity|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 general election===
The party stood ten candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]] on 7 May 2015, seven of which were jointly candidates of Left Unity and of the [[Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition]] (TUSC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leftunity.org/candidates-2015/|title=Candidates 2015 - Left Unity|website=leftunity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of party candidates (some jointly with TUSC) also stood in local elections that day.

===Following Labour leadership elections ===
Left Unity was profoundly impacted by the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|Labour Party leadership election of September 2015]], when [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2015|Jeremy Corbyn was elected]].&lt;ref&gt;Left Unity website - article by Salman Shaheen, Tom Watson, Pete Green, "The impossible has happened...."&lt;/ref&gt; During the leadership election, Left Unity opposed what it saw as a "witch hunt" against left-wingers who were not Labour Party members, but were allowed to vote for Corbyn as leader because of election rules that were changed under former leader [[Ed Miliband]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Labour leadership: Left Unity 'witch hunt' claims|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33819614|accessdate=14 January 2016|work=BBC News|date=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33849773 "How is Labour vetting new members?"], BBC News; retrieved 20 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been calculated that Corbyn would have won in the first round with 51% of votes, even without "£3 registered supporters", having gained the support of 49.6% of full members and 57.6% of affiliated (trade union) supporters.&lt;ref name=IndyIndy&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Jon|title=Jeremy Corbyn won a landslide with full Labour party members, not just £3 supporters|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-won-a-landslide-with-full-labour-party-members-not-just-3-supporters-10498221.html|accessdate=20 September 2015|work=The Independent|date=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34221155|title=Labour leadership results in full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanying Corbyn's campaign and unexpected election was a significant influx of several hundred thousand of new members and supporters, shifting the political direction and membership base of the party leftwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=George|last2=Pickard|first2=Jim|title=Corbyn defends shift to left as he tries to lift shattered morale|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f763ebec-66ce-11e5-a57f-21b88f7d973f.html|accessdate=25 November 2015|work=Financial Times|date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the weeks following Corbyn's election as Leader of the Labour Party, approximately 300 Left Unity members, including many prominent leadership figures, resigned and joined the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;Weekly Worker online issue 1083, "Charting our Future"&lt;/ref&gt; The November 2015 Left Unity Party Conference was dominated by the issue of what to do now that the Labour Party was led by Corbyn, a leader with politics similar to those of Left Unity, but with a mass membership of socialists, compared to Left Unity's then 1,500 members—down from its 2014 peak of 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;Tendance Coatesy Blog Nov 2015 on forthcoming Left Unity Conference&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the motions discussed the possible dissolution of Left Unity as a political party, with party members joining either the Labour Party itself or [[Momentum (organisation)|Momentum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wintour|first1=Patrick|title=Left Unity party to consider joining Labour|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/19/left-unity-party-ken-loach-to-consider-joining-labour-jeremy-corbyn|accessdate=16 December 2016|work=The Guardian|date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2016, membership had fallen further to 1,230 members.&lt;ref&gt; http://leftunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/LU-NC-minutes-16-July-2016.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the Labour leadership election [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|one year later]], individuals who had retweeted Left Unity were accused of supporting rival parties and therefore expelled from the party, therefore being unable to vote in the leadership election. Left Unity and others on social media saw this as hypocritical and contributed to the rise of the [[hashtag]] #LabourPurge on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mackey|first1=Robert|title=For @UKLabour, RT = Endorsement, Apparently|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/world/europe/britains-labour-party-accused-of-purging-members.html|accessdate=16 December 2016|work=The New York Times|date=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 general election===
Left Unity called for a victory for Labour in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leftunity.org/general-election-left-unity-calls-for-a-labour-victory/|title=General election: Left Unity calls for a Labour victory - Left Unity|website=leftunity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==
In 2014, the organisation protested at then Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]] following the decision by two examination boards ([[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]] and [[Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations|OCR]]) within the United Kingdom to remove American literature from their set texts with a short [[sit-in protest]] in the [[Department for Education]] (DfE) headquarters in central London. Left Unity accused the new curriculum of propagating "a more narrow teaching agenda in our schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burns|first1=Judith|title=Left Unity protest reads US books at Michael Gove's department|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-27643098|accessdate=15 December 2016|work=BBC News|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
# {{note|nb1}} This total includes votes cast in the multiple-candidate ward of Oakleigh, where Left Unity only stood one candidate; the percentage calculation is not adjusted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="139345">This page is a list of attacks undertaken (or believed to have been undertaken) by the '''Euskadi Ta Askatasuna''' ([[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]), an armed [[Basque nationalist|Basque terrorist]] movement, mainly in Spain. The list includes attacks by all the branches and divisions that ETA had through its history, as well as some [[kale borroka]] attacks. Important failed attacks are also included.

Since 1961, ETA conducted many attacks against a variety of targets.  Because these attacks number in the hundreds over a span of more than 45 years, not all can be included here.  This incomplete list may include attacks noted for being the first of their kind made by the organization, first in a particular area, notability of targets, large number of victims, unique method of attack, or other historic significance. The list is of those attacks described above between 1961 and 2011.

The number of people killed by ETA is sometimes highly disputed. The Spanish Interior Ministry, the Basque government, and major news agencies state that 829 people were killed in ETA attacks. Some victims' organizations such as the [[Asociación de Víctimas del Terrorismo]] and the ''Colectivo de Víctimas del Terrorismo en el País Vasco'' place the death toll of ETA's victims at 952, including in the list [[DRIL]]'s victim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Long Table''' is an "experimental open public forum that is a hybrid performance-installation-roundtable-discussion-dinner-party designed to facilitate dialogue through the gathering together of people with common interests"&lt;ref name=LADA&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Table on Live Art and Feminism with Lois Weaver|url=http://www.thisisliveart.co.uk/blog/long-table-on-live-art-and-feminism-with-lois-weaver/|work=LADA|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by the artist and academic [[Lois Weaver]]. The Long Table is part of Weaver's [[Public Address Systems]] project, under the strand "Strategies for Engaging the Public Through the Everyday".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TfSAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=public+address+systems+lois+weaver&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FiPofDrAcm&amp;sig=L5xQYmaGvCQ3VE1RkHaTeROEArs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAuZXh9oLaAhUumeAKHcCwB5A4FBDoAQguMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=public%20address%20systems%20lois%20weaver&amp;f=false|title=Performance and Community: Commentary and Case Studies|date=2013-12-19|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781408147252|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was inspired by the 1995 Dutch film ''[[Antonia's Line]]'', directed by [[Marleen Gorris]]. The film won many awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].&lt;ref name=LADA /&gt;

==Development==
The Long Table development was funded by grants from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] in 2003, and the Regional Lottery Program and the [[Arts Council of England]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web|title=Lois Weaver|url=http://splitbritches.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/lois-weaver-resumc3a91.pdf|work=Split Britches|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Long Table a "Long Table on Feminism", was held as part of the [[Live Art Development Agency]]'s (LADA) third Restock Rethink Reflect initiative, and constituted a discussion on what and who is missing from historical accounts, and what to do about it. The event was attended by over 100 artists and thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisisliveart.co.uk/blog/long-table-on-feminism-documentation|title=Long Table on Feminism Documentation - Blog - Live Art Development Agency|website=Live Art Development Agency|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common Elements ==
The Long Table was designed to stage public conversations around difficult subjects. Long Tables begin with a group of people sitting around a table that is set with empty chairs. To begin the conversation a question is asked, and participants are able to take a seat at the table if they wish to speak. Participants are not allowed to speak unless they are sitting at the table, and they may join or leave the table at any time. If there are no seats available they are permitted to ask for a seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.intermissionmagazine.ca/artist-perspective/queer-culture-generation-gap/|title=Intermission {{!}} Queer Culture’s Generation Gap|date=2017-06-01|work=Intermission|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event has been described as 'a performance of a dinner party where conversation is the only course.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sasahblog.com/mental-health-and-the-importance-of-long-table-discussion/|title=Mental Health and the Importance of Long-Table Discussion|date=2017-02-03|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
The Long Table has been installed in many location, including [[Casa de Lapa]], Rio de Janeiro; [[Museumsquartier|Tanzquartier Wein]], Vienna; [[National Review of Live Art]], Glasgow; [[University of Indiana]], Illinois; [[Queen Mary University of London]], Space Gallery, [[Battersea Arts Centre]], [[London International Festival of Theatre]], and South Bank, London; [[Hemispheric Institute]]’s Encuentro in Buenos Aires, Argentina.&lt;ref name=CV /&gt;

{{Democracy}}
{{Electoral systems}}
{{Politics}}
'''Majority rule''' is a decision rule that selects alternatives which have a [[majority]], that is, more than half the votes. It is the binary decision rule used most often in influential decision-making bodies, including the [[legislature]]s of [[Electoral democracy|democratic nation]]s.

== Distinction with plurality ==
Though [[Plurality voting system|plurality]] (first-past-the post) is often mistaken for majority rule, they are not the same.&lt;ref name="Tyranny" /&gt; Plurality makes the option with the most votes the winner, regardless of whether the fifty percent threshold is passed. This is equivalent to majority rule when there are only two alternatives. However, when there are more than two alternatives, it is possible for plurality to choose an alternative that has less than fifty percent of the votes cast in its favor.

== Use ==

Majority rule is used pervasively in many modern western democracies. It is frequently used in legislatures and other bodies in which alternatives can be considered and amended in a process of deliberation until the final version of a proposal is adopted or rejected by majority rule.&lt;ref name="Tyranny" /&gt; It is one of the basic rules prescribed in books like ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 4|edition = 11th|quote = The basic principle of decision in a [[deliberative assembly]] is that, to become the act or choice of the body, a proposition must be adopted by a ''majority vote''. . .|ref = harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules in such books and those rules adopted by groups may additionally prescribe the use of a [[Supermajority|supermajoritarian]] rule under certain circumstances, such as a two-thirds rule to close debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[referendum]]s are decided by majority rule.

== Properties ==

=== May's Theorem ===
{{main|May's Theorem}}
According to May, majority rule is the only reasonable decision rule that is "fair", that is, that does not privilege voters by letting some votes count for more or privilege an alternative by requiring fewer votes for its passing. Stated more formally, majority rule is the only binary decision rule that has the following properties:&lt;ref name="May"&gt;May, Kenneth O. 1952. "A set of independent necessary and sufficient conditions for simple majority decisions", ''Econometrica'', Vol. 20, Issue 4, pp. 680–684.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fey"&gt;Mark Fey, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20030806231803/http://troi.cc.rochester.edu/~markfey/papers/May.pdf May’s Theorem with an Infinite Population]", ''Social Choice and Welfare'', 2004, Vol. 23, issue 2, pages 275–293.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Fairness:''' This can be further separated into two properties:
** '''Anonymity:''' The decision rule treats each voter identically. When using majority rule, it makes no difference who casts a vote; indeed the voter's identity need not even be known.
** '''Neutrality:''' The decision rule treats each alternative equally. This is unlike [[Supermajority|supermajoritarian]] rules, which can allow an alternative that has received fewer votes to win.
* '''Decisiveness:''' The decision rule selects a unique winner.
* '''Monotonicity:''' The decision rule would always, if a voter were to change a preference, select the alternative that the voter preferred, if that alternative would have won before the change in preference. Similarly, the decision rule would never, if a voter were to change a preference, select a candidate the voter did not prefer, if that alternative would not have won before the change in preference.

Strictly speaking, it has been shown that majority rule meets these criteria only if the number of voters is odd or infinite. If the number of voters is even, there is the chance that there will be a tie, and so the criterion of neutrality is not met. Many deliberative bodies reduce one participant's voting capacity—namely, they allow the chair to vote only to break ties. This substitutes a loss of total anonymity for the loss of neutrality.

=== Other properties ===
In group decision-making it is possible for a [[voting paradox]] to form. That is, it is possible that there are alternatives a, b, and c such that a majority prefers a to b, another majority prefers b to c, and yet another majority prefers c to a.
Because majority rule requires an alternative to have only majority support to pass, a majority under majority rule is especially vulnerable to having its decision overturned. (The minimum number of alternatives that can form such a cycle (voting paradox) is 3 if the number of voters is different from 4, because the [[Nakamura number]] of the majority rule is 3. For supermajority rules the minimum number is often greater, because the Nakamura number is often greater.)

As Rae argued and Taylor proved in 1969, majority rule is the rule that maximizes the likelihood that the issues a voter votes for will pass and that the issues a voter votes against will fail.&lt;ref name="Tyranny" /&gt;

Schmitz and Tröger (2012) consider a collective choice problem with two alternatives and they show that the majority rule maximizes utilitarian welfare among all incentive compatible, anonymous, and neutral voting rules, provided that the voters’ types are independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Patrick W.|last2=Tröger|first2=Thomas|date=2012|title=The (sub-)optimality of the majority rule|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geb.2011.08.002|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=74|issue=2|pages=651–665|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2011.08.002|issn=0899-8256|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, when the votersʼ utilities are stochastically correlated, other dominant-strategy choice rules may perform better than the majority rule. Azrieli and Kim (2014) extend the analysis for the case of independent types to asymmetric environments and by considering both anonymous and non-anonymous rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azrieli|first=Yaron|last2=Kim|first2=Semin|date=2014|title=Pareto efficiency and weighted majority rules|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/iere.12083|journal=International Economic Review|language=en|volume=55|issue=4|pages=1067–1088|doi=10.1111/iere.12083|issn=0020-6598|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Limitations ==

=== Arguments for limitations ===

==== Minority rights ====

Because a majority can win a vote under majority rule, it has been commonly argued that majority rule can lead to a "[[tyranny of the majority]]". Supermajoritarian rules, such as the three-fifths supermajority rule required to end a [[filibuster]] in the [[United States Senate]], have been proposed as preventative measures of this problem. Other experts argue that this solution is questionable. Supermajority rules do not guarantee that it is a minority that will be protected by the supermajority rule; they only establish that one of two alternatives is the [[status quo]], and privilege it against being overturned by a mere majority.  To use the example of the US Senate, if a majority votes against [[cloture]], then the filibuster will continue, even though a minority supports it. Anthony McGann argues that when there are multiple minorities and one is protected (or privileged) by the supermajority rule, there is no guarantee that the protected minority won't be one that is already privileged, and if nothing else it will be the one that has the privilege of being aligned with the status quo.&lt;ref name="Tyranny"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=csd | title = The Tyranny of the Supermajority: How Majority Rule Protects Minorities | accessdate = 2008-06-09 | author = Anthony J. McGann | year = 2002 | format = PDF | work = | publisher = Center for the Study of Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The ref to "Tyranny" covers the entire paragraph as of 2009 Jan. 17 --&gt;

Another way to safeguard against tyranny of the majority, it is argued{{by whom|date=December 2013}}, is to guarantee certain rights. Inalienable rights, including who can vote, which cannot be transgressed by a majority, can be decided beforehand as a separate act,&lt;ref&gt;A Przeworski, JM Maravall, I NetLibrary ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EMB-F6Forx8C Democracy and the Rule of Law]'' (2003) p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; by charter or constitution. Thereafter, any decision that unfairly targets a minority's right could be said to be [[majoritarian]], but would not be a legitimate example of a majority decision because it would violate the requirement for [[civil rights|equal rights]]. In response, advocates of unfettered majority rule argue that because the procedure that privileges constitutional rights is generally some sort of supermajoritarian rule, this solution inherits whatever problems this rule would have. They also add the following: First, constitutional rights, being words on paper, cannot by themselves offer protection. Second, under some circumstances, the rights of one person cannot be guaranteed without making an imposition on someone else; as Anthony McGann wrote, "one man's right to property in the antebellum South was another man's slavery". Finally, as [[Amartya Sen]] stated when presenting the [[liberal paradox]], a proliferation of rights may make everyone worse off.&lt;ref name="Logic"&gt;McGann, Anthony J.  The Logic of Democracy: Reconciling, Equality, Deliberation, and Minority Protection. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. 2006. {{ISBN|0-472-06949-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Erroneous priorities====
The '''erroneous priorities effect''' ('''EPE''') states that groups acting upon what they initially consider important are almost always misplacing their effort.  When groups do this they have not yet determined which factors are most influential in their potential to achieve desired change.  Only after identifying those factors are they ready to take effective action. EPE was discovered by [[Kevin Dye]] after extensive research at the [[Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Dye, K.M. and Conaway, D.S. (1999) 'Lessons learned from five years of application of the cogniscope', Approach to the Food and Drug Administration, CWA Report, Interactive Management Consultants, Paoli.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dye, K. (1999). Dye's law of requisite evolution of observations, in Christakis, A.N. and Bausch, K. (Eds.): How People Harness their Collective Wisdom and Power, Information Age Publishing, Greenwich, CT, pp.166–169.&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of EPE led to the recognition that even with good intentions for [[participatory democracy]], people cannot collectively take effective actions unless they change the paradigm for languaging and voting.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, T.R., and Christakis, A.N. (2010) The Talking Point: Creating an Environment for ExploringComplex Meaning, Information Age Publishing, Greenwich, CT.&lt;/ref&gt; EPE is a negative consequence of phenomena such as [[spreadthink]] and [[groupthink]]. Effective priorities for actions that are dependent on recognizing the influence patterns of global interdependencies, are defeated by the EPE, when priorities are chosen on the basis of aggregating individual stakeholder subjective voting that is largely blind to those interdependencies. Dye's work resulted in the discovery of the 6th law of the science of [[structured dialogic design]],&lt;ref&gt;Christakis, A.N. and Bausch, K. (2006).

Some argue that majority rule can lead to poor deliberation practice or even to "an aggressive culture and conflict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://seedsforchange.org.uk/free/consens#wrong| title = What's wrong with majority voting?| accessdate = 2006-01-17 | year = 2005 | work = Consensus Decision Making | publisher =  Seeds for Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, some{{Who|date=April 2010}} have asserted that majority rule fails to measure the [[intensity of preference]]s.  For example, the authors of ''An Anarchist Critique of Democracy'' argue that "two voters who are casually interested in doing something" can defeat one voter who has "dire opposition" to the proposal of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thoughtcrime.org/writings/democracy.html | title = An Anarchist Critique of Democracy | accessdate = 2008-06-09 | year = 2005 | work = | publisher = |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20080429224620/http://www.thoughtcrime.org/writings/democracy.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voting theorists have often claimed that cycling leads to debilitating instability.&lt;ref name="Tyranny" /&gt;    Buchanan and Tullock argue that unanimity is the only decision rule that guarantees economic efficiency.&lt;ref name="Tyranny" /&gt;

Supermajority rules are often used in binary decisions where a positive decision is weightier than a negative one. Under the standard definition of special majority voting, a positive decision is made if and only if a substantial portion of the votes support that decision—for example, two thirds or three fourths.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008|reason=What is the standard definition of special majority voting? Who defined it?}}    For example, US jury decisions require the support of at least 10 of 12 jurors, or even unanimous support. This supermajoritarian concept follows directly from the [[presumption of innocence]] on which the US legal system is based. [[Rousseau]] advocated the use of supermajority voting on important decisions when he said, "The more the deliberations are important and serious, the more the opinion that carries should approach unanimity."&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau. The Social Contract. bk. 4, ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments against limitations ===

==== Minority rights ====

McGann argues that majority rule helps to protect [[minority rights]], at least in settings in which deliberation occurs. The argument is that cycling ensures that parties that lose to a majority have an interest to remain part of the group's process, because the decision can easily be overturned by another majority. Furthermore, if a minority wishes to overturn a decision, it needs to form a coalition with only enough of the group members to ensure that more than half approves of the new proposal. (Under supermajority rules, a minority might need a coalition consisting of something greater than a majority to overturn a decision.)&lt;ref name="Tyranny" /&gt;

To support the view that majority rule protects minority rights better than supermajority rules McGann points to the cloture rule in the US Senate, which was used to prevent the extension of civil liberties to racial minorities.&lt;ref name="Tyranny" /&gt; Ben Saunders, while agreeing that majority rule may offer better protection than supermajority rules, argues that majority rule may nonetheless be of little help to the most despised minorities in a group.&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://oxford.academia.edu/documents/BenSaunders_SubmittedThesis.pdf | title = Democracy-as-Fairness: Justice, Equal Chances, and Lotteries | accessdate = September 8, 2013 | author = Ben Saunders | year = 2008 | format = PDF | work = | publisher = |archivedate=September 10, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910032028/http://oxford.academia.edu/documents/BenSaunders_SubmittedThesis.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other arguments against limitations ====
Some argue{{Who|date=April 2010}} that deliberative democracy flourishes under majority rule. They argue that under majority rule, participants always have to convince more than half the group at the very least, while under supermajoritarian rules participants might only need to persuade a minority.&lt;ref name="Saunders" /&gt; Furthermore, proponents argue that cycling gives participants an interest to compromise, rather than strive to pass resolutions that only have the bare minimum required to "win".&lt;ref name="Logic" /&gt;

Another argument for majority rule is that within this atmosphere of compromise, there will be times when a minority faction will want to support the proposal of another faction in exchange for support of a proposal it believes to be vital. Because it would be in the best interest of such a faction to report the true intensity of its preference, so the argument goes, majority rule differentiates weak and strong preferences. McGann argues that situations such as these give minorities incentive to participate, because there are few permanent losers under majority rule, and so majority rule leads to systemic stability. He points to governments that use majority rule which largely goes unchecked—the governments of the [[Netherlands]], [[Austria]], and [[Sweden]], for example—as empirical evidence of majority rule's stability.&lt;ref name="Tyranny" /&gt;

[[File:Hungarian warriors.jpg|thumb|Ancient Hungarian warriors]]
The '''male warrior hypothesis''' ('''MWH''') is an [[evolutionary psychology]] hypothesis by Professor [[Mark van Vugt]]  which argues that human psychology has been shaped by between-group competition and conflict. Specifically, the evolutionary history of coalitional [[aggression]] between groups of men may have resulted in sex-specific differences in the way outgroups are perceived, creating [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup vs. outgroup]] tendencies that are still observable today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.professormarkvanvugt.com/images/files/malewarrior.pdf|title = Gender Differences in Cooperation and Competition:The Male-Warrior Hypothesis|last = Vugt|first = Mark Van|date = 2006|journal = Psychological Science|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01842.x|pmid = 17362372|volume=18|issue = 1|pages=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evolution and the psychology of intergroup conflict: the male warrior hypothesis|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date = 2012-03-05|issn = 0962-8436|pmc = 3260849|pmid = 22271783|pages = 670–679|volume = 367|issue = 1589|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2011.0301|first = Melissa M.|last = McDonald|first2 = Carlos David|last2 = Navarrete|first3 = Mark|last3 = Van Vugt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this hypothesis, intergroup conflict represents an opportunity for men to gain access to mates, territory, and increased status. As such, conflicts may have created [[Evolutionary pressure|selection pressures]] for psychological mechanisms in men to initiate intergroup aggression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In women, [[Group conflict|intergroup conflict]] substantially increases the risk of sexual assault by outgroup men, and may have created selection pressure for psychological mechanisms that bias women against outgroup men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Violence and warfare ===
[[Violence]] and [[aggression]] are universal across human societies, and have likely been features of human behavior since prehistory. Archaeologists have found mass graves dating to the late [[Pleistocene]] and early [[Holocene]] that contain primarily male skeletons showing signs of blunt force trauma, indicating the cause of death was by weapons used in combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Did warfare among ancestral hunter–gatherer groups affect the evolution of human social behaviors|last = Bowles|first = S.|date = 2009|journal = Science|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence among humans occurs in distinct patterns, differing most obviously by sex. [[Ethnography|Ethnographic]] findings and modern [[crime]] data indicate that the majority of violence is both perpetrated by and targeted at males, and males are the most likely to be victims of violence. This male-male pattern of violence has been observed so repeatedly and in so many cultures that it may qualify as a [[human universal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Human Universals|last = Brown|first = D. E.|publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 1991|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tribal behavior ===
[[File:African Warriors CNE-v1-p58-C.jpg|thumb|Men preparing for a raid.]]
Humans are a social species with a long history of living in [[Tribe|tribal groups]]. The psychological mechanisms that evolved to handle the complexities of group living have also created heuristics for quickly categorizing others as ingroup or outgroup members, with different behavioral strategies for each: treat ingroup members (those in one’s own group) favorably, and react to outgroup members (those who belong to a different group) with fear and aggression. These tendencies arise with little motivation, and have been provoked over superficial groups in lab studies—for example, by showing paintings to participants and creating groups based on which painting participants prefer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Arousal of ingroup–outgroup bias by a chance win or loss.|last = Rabbie|first = J. M.|date = 1969|journal = J. Pers. Soc. Psychol.|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Horowitz|first2 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Social categorization and intergroup behavior|last = Tajfel|first = H.|date = 1971|journal = Eur. J. Soc. Psychol.|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Billig|first2 = M. G.|last3 = Bundy|first3 = R. P.|last4 = Flament|first4 = C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingroup and outgroup preferences have also been observed in other social primates, such as the [[rhesus macaque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The evolution of intergroup bias: perceptions and attitudes in rhesus macaques|last = Mahajan|first = N.|date = 2011|journal = J. Pers. Soc. Psychol.|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Martinez|first2 = M. A.|last3 = Gutierrez|first3 = N. L.|last4 = Diesendruck|first4 = G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The male warrior hypothesis suggests that the ease with which individuals discriminate against members of other groups is an adaptation resulting from a long history of being threatened by outgroup males, who are in competition for resources.

=== Sex differences in parental investment ===
The MWH argues that the sex differences in attitudes towards outgroup members may be a result of the different reproductive strategies used by males and females—specifically, the greater competition among males for mates. In mammals, males and females have distinct reproductive strategies based on the physiology of reproduction. Because females gestate, birth, feed, and invest more overall resources in each of their offspring, they are more selective with their mates but have greater certainty of being able to reproduce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Males, in contrast, can mate at a very low energetic cost once they have found a partner, but are only able to attract a female if they have physical or social characteristics that can be converted into resources—e.g., territory, food resources, status, power, or influence—or the strength and alliances to coerce females to mate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, there is typically much greater variability in the reproductive success of males within a species and higher competition among males for mates. The strongest, best adapted, and most powerful males may have a [[Harem (zoology)|harem]], while less fit males never reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Male, female: The evolution of human sex differences, 2nd edn|last = Geary|first = D. C.|publisher = American Psychological Association.|year = |isbn = |location = Washington, D.C.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For more details on this topic, see [[Robert Trivers|Trivers]]' theory of [[parental investment]].

=== Male attitudes towards groups ===
The male warrior hypothesis predicts that because males may have historically remained in the groups in which they were born rather than moving away at adulthood (see [[Patrilocal residence|patrilocality]]), they have a higher overall relatedness to their group than the female members, who would have moved to their new husbands’ group upon marriage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Males may have a stronger interest in defending their group, and will be more likely to act aggressively towards outgroup males they encounter who may be attempting to steal resources or weaken the group with violence.

For men at risk of never finding a mate, the fitness benefit to engaging in aggressive, violent behavior could outweigh the potential costs of fightings, especially if fighting alongside a coalition. Furthermore, the groups with more individuals who formed coalitions and acted altruistically to in-group members but aggressively to outgroup members would prosper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Multilevel selection theory and its implications for psychological science|last = Wilson|first = D.

== Observational evidence/studies ==

=== Sex differences ===
Consistent with the expectations of the male warrior hypothesis, several studies have shown more [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sex differences in socio-political attitudes revisited|last = Ekehammar|first = B|date = 1985|journal = Educ.

Studies have also tested the responses of women to outgroups, and have shown that women are most likely to fear outgroup males during the [[Ovulation|periovulatory]] phase of the [[menstrual cycle]], when [[fertility]] is at its peak.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Race bias tracks conception risk across the menstrual cycle.|last = Navarrete|first = C.

A. |volume=12 |issue = 5|pages=729–738|type = Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, women who feel most at risk of sexual coercion are more likely to fear outgroup males,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fear extinction to an outgroup face: the role of target gender|last = Navarrete|first = C.

K.|last4 = Mendes|first4 = W.|last5 = Thomsen|first5 = L.|last6 = Sidanius|first6 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aligns with the predictions of the MWH.

=== Non-human evidence ===
Coalitionary violence has also been observed in social species besides humans, including other primates. Chimpanzee ([[Common chimpanzee|''Pan troglodytes'']]) males demonstrate similar violent behavior: groups of males form coalitions that patrol the borders of their territory and attack neighboring bands. Chimpanzees also have patrilocal living patterns, which aid with forming close coalitions, as all males are likely kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Intergroup relations in chimpanzees.|last = Wilson|first = M. L.|date = 2003|journal = Annu. Rev. Anthropol.|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Wrangham|first2 = R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prepared learning studies ===
In studies of [[Preparedness (learning)|prepared learning]], conditioned fear responses to images of outgroup males were far more difficult to extinguish than conditioned fear responses to outgroup females or ingroup members of either sex, as measured by conductivity tests of perspiration on the skin. These results held true whether the participant was male or female.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because the neural circuitry for fear responses are more developed towards stimuli that have posed a larger threat for most of human history (snakes and spiders, for example, which were dangers frequently encountered by foragers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fear, phobias and preparedness: toward an evolved module of fear and fear learning|last = Öhman|first = A.|date = 2001|journal = Psychol. Rev.|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Mineka|first2 = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), these findings suggest that outgroup males may have been more of a threat to physical safety than outgroup women or ingroup members, supporting the male warrior hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Criticism/conflicting findings ==
While the male warrior hypothesis is supported by a number of experimental studies in [[neuroscience]] and [[social psychology]], the [[effects of war]] and aggression on human psychology are still up for debate. General questions include: A) why are sex differences found in some laboratory experiments or field studies but not in others? (B) do females prefer warrior behavior in males regardless of its risk? and (C) is female [[sexual selection]] for male peacefulness also conceivable?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The evolutionary interplay of intergroup conflict and altruism in humans: a review of parochial altruism theory and prospects for its extension|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date = 2014-11-07|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 4211448|pmid = 25253457|volume = 281|issue = 1794|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2014.1539|first = Hannes|last = Rusch|page=20141539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are dealing with voting systems that work in the following way: Each voter reports his entire [[preference (economics)|preference relation]] over the set of alternatives. The set of reports is called a ''preference profile''. A ''social choice rule'' maps the preference profile to the selected alternative.

'''Maskin monotonicity''' is the following property of a social choice rule: Suppose that, for preference profile P1, the chosen alternative is A1. Consider another preference profile P2 such that, the position
of A1 relative to each of the other alternatives either improves
or stays the same as in P1. Then, A1 should still be chosen at P2.&lt;ref name="dk15"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00355-014-0835-6|title=Maskin-monotonic scoring rules|journal=Social Choice and Welfare|volume=44|issue=2|pages=423|year=2014|last1=Doğan|first1=Battal|last2=Koray|first2=Semih}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maskin monotonicity is a necessary condition for implementability in [[Nash equilibrium]].
Moreover, any social choice rule that satisfies Maskin-monotonicity and another property called "no veto power" can be implemented in Nash equilibrium form if there are three or more voters.&lt;ref name="m98"/&gt;

'''Mission Innovation''' is a global initiative to accelerate public and private [[clean energy]] innovation to address [[climate change]], make clean energy affordable to consumers, and create [[green jobs]] and commercial opportunities.&lt;ref name="White House" /&gt;

==Foundation==
It was announced by [[Bill Gates]] at [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP21]] on 30 November 2015, on stage with [[Barack Obama|President Obama]], [[François Hollande|President Hollande]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chhabra|first1=Esha|title=Bill Gates Rallies With Tech Leaders To Launch A Multi-Billion Dollar Energy Fund|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eshachhabra/2015/11/30/bill-gates-rallies-with-tech-leaders-to-launch-a-multi-billion-dollar-energy-fund/|website=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes, Inc.|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Narendra Modi|Prime Minister Modi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PM Modi attends Mission Innovation event hosted by President Obama|url=http://www.narendramodi.in/pm-modi-attends-mission-innovation-event-hosted-by-president-obama-385256|website=Narendra Modi: official site|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the launch, 20 countries committed to double their respective [[clean energy]] [[research and development]] over the five years to 2020. For the [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]], this translates into an additional $4&amp;nbsp;billion by the end of 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Ernest Moniz|Moniz]]|first1=Ernest|title=Government, private sector need to invest in clean energy|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/11/30/government-private-sector-need-invest-clean-energy/nSjYWGp3iuxcrhNaegguvN/story.html|accessdate=30 November 2015|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=Boston Globe Media|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The countries include the five most populous (as at 2015): China, India, the United States, Indonesia, and Brazil. All 20 launch partner countries represent 75 percent of the world's [[CO2 emissions]] from electricity, and over 80 percent of the world's clean energy R&amp;D investment.&lt;ref name="White House"&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcing: "Mission Innovation"|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/11/29/announcing-mission-innovation|website=[[The White House]]|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its link to [[private sector]] investment is via the [[Breakthrough Energy Coalition]] group of private investors, also spearheaded by Bill Gates and which formed in parallel at [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP21]].&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clarke|first1=Melissa|last2=Phillips|first2=Sara|title=Mission Innovation: Bill Gates behind drive to tip billions into clean energy research |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-01/gates-behind-mission-innovation-push/6990154 |accessdate=1 December 2015|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Several of Mission Innovation's aims are compatible with those of [[Global Apollo Programme]], announced earlier in 2015. What Mission Innovation's lacks in comparison, at least at launch, is a clear, dated, target; and a committee to co-ordinate research efforts across the globe and to identify successful opportunities.&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt;

==Technology focus==
The initiative is open in its focus and will, according to Gates, "pursue literally dozens and dozens of paths".&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;

Several example technologies were mentioned at the launch of the initiative: [[biofuel]], [[carbon capture and storage]], [[airborne wind turbines]], [[nuclear fission]] and [[nuclear fusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheadle|first1=Bruce|title=COP21: Trudeau pledges $300-million-a-year commitment to clean energy technology|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/canada/2015/11/30/trudeau-keeps-election-promise-in-paris-with-300m-a-year-clean-tech-commitment.html|accessdate=1 December 2015|work=Metro|publisher=[[Metro International]]|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates has also mentioned the potential of liquid [[hydrocarbons]] being produced from [[sunlight]] via [[artificial photosynthesis]] (''[[solar fuel]]'') by 2025.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Pilita|title=November 30, 2015 4:55&amp;nbsp;pm COP21: Gates fund to back development of liquid hydrocarbons|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/169dd758-976b-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc.html|accessdate=1 December 2015|work=[[The Financial Times]]|publisher=[[The Nikkei|Nikkei Group]]|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallace|first1=Bruce|title=Gates Joins Big Wigs in Paris to Push Clean Energy Initiative|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gates-joins-big-wigs-in-paris-to-push-clean-energy-initiative/|website=[[Scientific American]]|publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]]|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of South Africa}}

South Africa has a liberal constitution that protects all basic political freedoms. However, there have been many incidents of political repression, dating back to at least 2002,&lt;ref name="antieviction.org.za"&gt;[http://antieviction.org.za/related-writing-and-resources/housing-battles-in-post-apartheid-south-africa-the-case-of-mandela-park-khayelitsha/ Housing battles in post-Apartheid South Africa: The Case of Mandela Park, Khayelitsha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524193411/http://antieviction.org.za/related-writing-and-resources/housing-battles-in-post-apartheid-south-africa-the-case-of-mandela-park-khayelitsha/ |date=24 May 2012 }}, by Martin Legassick, ''South African Labour Bulletin'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt; as well as threats of future repression in violation of this constitution leading some analysts, [[civil society]] organisations and popular movements to conclude that there is a new climate of political repression&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacsis.org.za/site/article/489.1 The Return of State Repression], Professor J.

It has been argued that "Zuma has enhanced the coercive capacity of the state"&lt;ref name="The 'Gatvol' Factor"&gt;[http://www.sacsis.org.za/site/article/599.1 The 'Gatvol' Factor], Jane Duncan, ''SACSIS'', January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and that he has focused on "building a state based on fear".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/columnists/2012/09/11/electing-for-lesser-evil-will-not-get-us-very-far Electing for lesser evil will not get us very far], Palessa Morudu, ''Business Day'', 11 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that repression has affected poor people's organisations most seriously but that repression directed against poor people has been systemically under-reported in the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/sundayindependent/media-underplaying-police-state-brutality-1.1369675#.UDpA2cHibgy Media underplaying police, state brutality], Jane Duncan, ''Sunday Independent'', 26 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that senior ANC politicians are responsible for the repression of grassroots activists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/07/20/protestors-are-killed-on-instructions-of-politicians-in-kzn-and_a_23038922/ Protestors Are Killed On Instructions Of Politicians In KZN And Society Turns A Blind Eye -- Inquiry], Marc Davis, ''The Huffington Post'', 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats to media freedom==
Under [[Jacob Zuma]] the ANC has expressed open opposition to media freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-06-18-jacob-zuma-and-the-second-transition-the-print-media Jacob Zuma and the second transition: The print media], Mandy de Waal, ''The Daily Maverick'', 18 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Serious concern has been expressed about the proposed [[Media Appeals Tribunal]] and [[Protection of Information Bill]] which, if passed, would significantly reduce press freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fxi.org.za/content/view/217/1/|title=Maintaining and creating a safe space for freedom of expression in South Africa - Freedom Of Expression Institute|first=|last=fxi.org.za|website=www.fxi.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacsis.org.za/site/article/652.1 The Real Fear Factor: Secrecy as the Mask of Power], Dr. Dale T.

There have been a number of reports of serious intimidation of journalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailymaverick.co.za/article/2011-07-06-anc-ratchets-up-its-anti-media-campaign-in-provinces ANC ratchets up its anti-media campaign in provinces], Mandy de Waal, ''The Daily Maverick'', 6 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Freedom of Expression Institute and ''[[The Mercury (South Africa)|The Mercury]]'' newspaper reported a death threat against a journalist in Durban by controversial local businessman Ricky Govender who claims close links with [[Jacob Zuma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abahlali.org/node/2183 Police repression in Protea South an indicator of a national trend], Freedom of Expression Institute, 5 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In Durban in 2009 the editor of ''The Mercury'', Philani Makhanya, laid a charge of intimidation against S'bu Mpisani, a politically connected contractor for the housing department in that city who had allegedly threatened the newspaper for its investigations into his activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-02-11-the-rise-and-fall-of-shauwn-and-sbu-mpisane-durbans-teflon-couple/ The rise and fall of Shauwn and S’bu Mpisane, Durban’s Teflon Couple], Nikki Moore, ''The Daily Maverick'', 11 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Port Elizabeth]] the branch chairperson of the ruling [[African National Congress]] (ANC), Nceba Faku, called for party supporters to burn down the offices of the local newspaper the ''[[Daily Dispatch]]'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.co.za/news/article/1297 Faku: Burn down the press], LUYOLO MKENTANE, ''The Daily Dispatch'', 20 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Piet Rampedi and Adriaan Bassoon, journalists at the ''[[City Press (South Africa)|City Press]]'', were subject to various threats and forms of intimidation while covering a story on corruption by [[Julius Malema]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-07-23-the-price-of-investigating-malema The price of investigating Julius Malema], Greg Nicholson, ''The Daily Maverick'', 23 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2012 ANC supporters publicly burnt copies of the ''City Press'' newspaper in Durban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/spear-fury-shatters-haffajee-1.1306097?ot=inmsa.ArticlePrintPageLayout.ot ‘Spear’ fury shatters Haffajee], Shain Germaner, ''IOL'', 28 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats to artistic freedom==
Poet Mbongeni Khumalo has claimed "that his no-holds barred lyricism attracted the attention of state security".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/entertainment/2013/01/18/poetry-must-reflect-south-africa-today Poetry must reflect South Africa today], GOODENOUGH MASHEGO, ''The Sowetan'', 18 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 leading figures in the ruling party called for a painting, ''[[The Spear (painting)|The Spear]]'', to be destroyed and publicly endorsed the defacement of the painting.

==Unlawful state bans on protests==
There have been a number of independently documented cases where the constitutionally protected right to protest has not been honoured by the state.&lt;ref name="The 'Gatvol' Factor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fxi.org.za/content/view/83/ Amandla!

==Breakdown in the rule of law==

In Durban  in 2013 the shack dwellers' movement [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] secured five High Court injunctions against evictions which were "systemically ignored by state actors who have repeatedly torn down the shacks of local residents".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tcr.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/11/18/1362480614557306.abstract ''Theoretical Criminology''] November 19, 2014 1362480614557306, Olly Owen &amp; Sarah-Jane Cooper Knock&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling party attitudes to independent organisations==
According to [[Zwelinzima Vavi]], [[COSATU]] Secretary General, "The [ruling] party unfortunately has adopted in our view an unnecessarily hostile posture to some progressive civil organisations and coalitions, painted a number of organisations with the same brush and has tended to take the view that they are the product of external agendas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-09-report-hammers-self-serving-anc Cosatu report hammers 'self-serving' ANC], MATUMA LETSOALO, ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 9 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Preparatory Committee for an Arms Trade Treaty''', known as '''PrepCom''', will meet a total of four times; they have already met twice.  The first PrepCom occurred from July 12 to July 23, 2010 at the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City]]. The second PrepCom occurred from February 28 to March 4, 2011 also in New York City.  A third meeting is scheduled for July, 2011.  The preparatory committees were designed to prepare [[United Nations member states|member states]], international organizations and [[non-governmental organization]]s for the Arms Trade Treaty negotiation in 2012. The Preparatory Committees are intended to prepare delegates and non-governmental organizations for the eventual Arms Trade Treaty negotiations, and is concerned with logistical, procedural and thematic issues.

== History ==
Countries in the [[United Nations]] have long been concerned about the lack of a global normative framework for guiding and governing [[Arms industry|international arms transfers]]. After years of international campaigning from individuals and states, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted in 2006 to negotiate an Arms Trade Treaty in 2012.

When delegates of the United Nations decided that they would negotiate an Arms Trade Treaty in 2012, there emerged a sentiment to host a series of preparatory conferences for member states and [[civil society]] to arrange and organize the eventual negotiations. In order to do this, four preparatory committees (or “PrepComs”) were scheduled.

The first PrepCom occurred from July 12 to July 23 in 2010 at the United Nations in New York City. The 2010 PrepCom featured an opening statement from the high representative for [[disarmament]] affairs. The eventual outcomes of the 2010 PrepCom were the establishment of an outline for a draft Treaty, draft [[preamble]], draft goals and objectives and three papers from the Friends of the Chair on scope, parameters and implementation of the eventual Arms Trade Treaty. 

The third preparatory Committee will take place in July, 2011.

In addition to the four Preparatory Committees, a Group of Governmental Experts was assembled to debate and discuss potential challenges facing an Arms Trade Treaty.

== Participants ==
The second PrepCom was attended by member states of the United Nations, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations. These participants were tasked with addressing the potential scope and parameters for an Arms Trade Treaty. The PrepCom conference was held in the [[United Nations Building]] in New York City.

== Preparatory Documents ==

The second PrepCom issued two definitive preparatory documents prior to the opening of the conference. Both a Provisional Agenda and a Provisional Programme of Work were issued and disseminated to PrepCom participants. These documents outlined the logistical timeline for the conference.

== Statements and Outcomes ==
The second PrepCom had several key issues that it was tasked to address. Scope, criteria and parameters, and international cooperation and assistance were all given a full day of statements.  The international organization [[Control Arms Campaign|Control Arms Coalition]] made a presentation. The chair, [[Roberto García Moritán]], issued three papers on scope, criteria and parameters, and international cooperation and assistance; the chair also issued a draft paper.

The '''River and Harbors Act of 1914''' expanded the [[Mississippi River Commission]]’s jurisdiction to oversee Federal fund distribution to needy States.  The act provided money to affected states each year of the [[Presidency of Woodrow Wilson|Wilson Administration]] for the building and maintenance of recommended methods of flood control.  In addition, the act authorized Federal money to be spent on improving various major harbors along the [[Eastern Seaboard of the United States]], most prominently being [[New York Harbor]].  The act also allotted more than $800,000 for the [[Hudson River]] banks to be enlarged.

'''Security level management''' ('''SLM''') comprises a quality assurance system for electronic information security.

The aim of SLM is to display the IT security status transparently across a company at any time, and to make IT security a measurable quantity. Transparency and measurability form the prerequisites for making IT security proactively monitorable, so that it can be improved continuously.

SLM is oriented towards the phases of the [[Deming Cycle]]/Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle: within the scope of SLM, abstract security policies or compliance guidelines at a company are transposed into operative, measureable specifications for the IT security infrastructure. The operative aims form the security level to be reached.

The security level is checked permanently against the current performance of the security systems (malware scanner, patch systems, etc.). Deviations can be recognised early on and adjustments made to the security system.
SLM falls under the range of duties of the [[Chief Security Officer]] (CSO), the [[Chief Information Officer]] (CIO) or the [[Chief Information Security Officer]] (CISO), who report directly to the Executive Board on IT Security and data availability.

== Classification ==
SLM is related to the disciplines of Security and Security Event management (SIEM), which the analysts [[Gartner]] summarise in their Magic Quadrant for Security Information and Event Management, and define as follows:
''"[…] SIM provides reporting and analysis of data primarily from host systems and applications, and secondarily from security devices — to support security policy compliance management, internal threat management and regulatory compliance initiatives. SIM supports the monitoring and incident management activities of the IT security organization […]. SEM improves security incident response capabilities. SEM processes near-real-time data from security devices, network devices and systems to provide real-time event management for security operations. […]"''

SIM and SEM relate to the infrastructure for realising superordinate security aims, but are not descriptive of a strategic management system with aims, measures, revisions and actions to be derived from this. SLM unites the requisite steps for realising a measurable, functioning IT security structure in a management control cycle.

SLM can be categorised under the strategic panoply of IT governance, which, via suitable organisation structures and processes, ensures that IT supports corporate strategy and objectives. SLM allows CSOs, CIOs and CISOs to prove that SLM is contributing towards protecting electronic data relevant to processes adequately, and therefore makes a contribution in part to IT governance.

== The Steps towards SLM ==
'''Defining the Security Level (Plan):''' Each company specifies security policies. The executive management defines aims in relation to the integrity, confidentiality, availability and authority of classified data. In order to be able to verify compliance with these specifications, concrete aims for the individual security systems at the company need to be derived from the abstract security policies. A security level consists of a collection of measurable limiting and threshold values.

''Example: operative aims like "the anti-virus systems at our UK sites need to be up-to-date no longer than four hours after publication of the current definition" need to be derived from superordinate security policies like "our employees should be able to work without being interrupted."''

Limiting and threshold values are to be specified separately and individually for different sites, locations and countries, because the [[IT infrastructure]] on-site and any other local determining factors need to be taken into consideration.

''Example: office buildings in the UK are normally equipped with high-speed dedicated lines. It is wholly realistic here to limit the deadline for supplying all computers with the newest anti-virus definitions to a few hours. For a factory in Asia, with a slow modem link to the web, a realistic limiting value would have to be set that is somewhat higher.''

The IT control manual Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology Cobit ([[CobiT]]) provides companies with instructions on transposing subordinate, abstract aims into measurable aims in a few steps.

'''Collecting and Analysing Data (Do):'''Information on the current status of the systems can be gleaned from the log file and status reports provided by individual anti-virus, anti-spyware or anti-spam consoles. Monitoring and reporting solutions analysing software applications from all software houses can simplify and accelerate data collection.

'''Checking the Security Level (Check):''' SLM prescribes continual reconciliation of the defined security level with the current measured values. Automated real-time reconciliation supplies companies with a permanent status report on the security status across all locations.

'''Adjusting the Security Structure (Act):''' Efficient SLM allows trend analyses and long-term comparative assessments to be made. Through the rolling observation of the security level, weak spots in the network can be identified early on and appropriate adjustments made proactively in the security systems.

== See also ==
Besides defining the specifications for engineering, introducing, operating, monitoring, maintaining and improving a documented information security management system, [[ISO/IEC 27001]] also defines the specifications for implementing suitable security mechanisms.

The IT Infrastructure Library ([[ITIL]]), a collection of best practices for IT control processes, goes far beyond IT security. In relation, it supplies criteria for how Security Officers can conceive IT security as an independent, qualitatively measurable service and integrate it into the universe of business-process-oriented IT processes. ITIL also works from the top down with policies, processes, procedures and job-related instructions, and assumes that both superordinate, but also operative aims need to be planned, implemented, controlled, evaluated and adjusted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10141">'''Sociotherapy''' is a [[social science]] and form of [[social work]], and [[sociology]]  that involves the study of groups of people, its constituent individuals and their behavior, using learned information in case and care management towards holistic life enrichment or improvement of social and life conditions.  

The professional practitioner of the field, who may be called a '''sociotherapist''' or '''life enrichment therapist''', sometimes called a '''clinical sociologist''', is usually concurrently a member of another relevant profession: [[medical doctor]], [[psychiatrist]], [[psychologist]], [[nurse]], [[social worker]], [[sociologist]], [[criminologist]], activity and recreational professionals, among others.  Clinical sociotherapy usually targets groups of [[children]], [[youth]]s or [[elderly]], employed in various settings such as treatment facilities or lifecare communities like [[nursing home]]s and are directly involved in case management and [[nursing care plan|care planning]].

==Professional definition==
Still in its infancy as a social science and profession, sociotherapy is ill-defined and thus takes many forms, according to the respective definitions created by the individual [[therapist]]s, firms and institutions that employ sociotherapists and life enrichment therapists.&lt;ref name=multiple&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12861370&amp;dopt=Abstract|title=[Sociotherapy in German social law. Indication, contents, and aspects of public health]|first=R.-M.|last=Frieboes|date=1 July 2003|publisher=|journal=Nervenarzt|volume=74|issue=7|pages=596–600|via=PubMed|doi=10.1007/s00115-002-1459-0|pmid=12861370}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Society for the Furtherance of Sociotherapy defines sociotherapy as "the methodical management of the living environment of a group of clients, directed towards reaching the treatment targets of this group—and conceived as a means of achieving the treatment targets of the individual client—within a functional unit, usually in a clinical treatment setting."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrum45.nl/therap/uksoc1.htm#def Sociotherapy in the clinic of Foundation Centrum '45, definition of Sociotherapy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222092444/http://centrum45.nl/therap/uksoc1.htm |date=2008-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition is most accepted especially in lifecare communities such as nursing homes.

The Sociotherapy Association in the United States describes a sociotherapy that emphasizes the support of awareness, relationship, and the integration of life and the environment. Its main focus is the process of interpersonal relationships as a method of facilitating healthier living, rather than diagnosing intrapsychic psychopathology, and attempting to change it through coercion and analysis (psychology and psychotherapy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociotherapyassociation.com Sociotherapy Association]&lt;/ref&gt; The Society for the Furtherance of Sociotherapy says: "Sociotherapy operates through a holistic vision of mankind. That is to say that the human being is seen as a somatic, psychic, social and spiritual unity, which is unique because of his own history of growth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrum45.nl/therap/uksoc2.htm#gen Sociotherapy in the clinic of Foundation Centrum '45, general methods of approach of Sociotherapy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928214003/http://www.centrum45.nl/therap/uksoc2.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition of sociotherapy as a social science and profession is also based on regional dicta.  For example, the public health insurance system of [[Germany]] offered a uniquely German definition in order to subsidize treatment by sociotherapeutic professionals.  It said that sociotherapy "designates non-medical, social, and work-related components of the care process".&lt;ref name=multiple/&gt; 

Sociotherapy has been used in the treatment and education of adolescents at Kanner Academy and Community Schools in Sarasota Florida US. In These settings the working definition of sociotherapy is the practice of promoting healthy growth and living by facilitating therapeutic communities, personal relationships and positive peer culture. It is better known as the "relationship therapy".&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Lee Ph.D, Kanner, C. (2004) The Value of Connection: A Relational Approach to Ethics. (Chapter 5 The Relational Ethic in the Treatment of Adolescents)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand L. Kannenberg wrote, "Sociotherapy for Sociopaths: Resocial Group". Designed by the author to help prevent relapse and rearrest of parolees and probationers at a community mental health center in 1986, this text outlines an evidence-based, twenty-four session group program created for adult clients with coexisting Substance Use Disorders and the persistent problems of aggressiveness, breaking rules and laws, carelessness, dishonesty, impulsivity, indifference, irresponsibility and irritability. The book examines the importance of sociotherapy or sociological counseling in the corrections and substance abuse fields. 
"Kannenberg's fresh approach to treating psychoactive chemical abusing sociopaths should be in every counselor's arsenal when treating a client of this nature."&lt;ref&gt;Misti Storie, Education and Training Coordinator, Counselor Resources, "Reader's Corner," (NAADAC News, August 2005).

==Credentialing professionals==
The Sociotherapy Association is certifying sociotherapists and support companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sociotherapyassociation.com/sociotherapy-certification/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411202505/http://www.sociotherapyassociation.com/sociotherapy-certification/ |archivedate=2013-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developing methods and theories==

===Practice===

The foundation of any sociotherapeutic relationship include the practice of dialogical relationship, the phenomenological method, field-theoretical strategies, experimental freedom, countertransference (CT) management.

Support Companionship is a time tested method for helping people, who for one reason or another, are struggling in their lives. Support Companions provide wrap-around support to adults, adolescents, families, the elderly, children, and service providers, when the support is needed! The foundation of support companion services is relationship, and the methodology of contact is sociotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supportcompanions.com|title=Support Companions - SUPPORTING HEALTHY LIVING ONE RELATIONSHIP AT A TIME|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociotherapists are constantly involved in creating and refining theories in group and socialization dynamics.  For example, a sociotherapist in a nursing home may experiment on the various methods one might employ to lure an introverted resident to activities and thus reduce the resident's risk of social isolation, which may be linked to the continued progression of that resident's [[dementia]].  In this example, the sociotherapist would also use activities like games and exercises to monitor an individual's [[mental health]] and use interaction with other residents as a tool to improve that mental health.

===Phenomenological method===

The goal of a phenomenological exploration is awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Yontef, G. (1993) Awareness, Dialogue, and Process, essays on Gestalt therapy. Highland, NY: The Gestalt Journal Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In Sociotherapy awareness and integration are central to healthy living. Much of the practice is centered around ways to support and improve a sense of awareness in our fields of experience. This is accomplished with relationship, experimentation and phenomenological exploration.

The phenomenological method comprises three steps: (1) the rule of epoché, (2) the rule of description, and (3) the rule of horizontalization.&lt;ref&gt;Spinelli, E. (2005) The interpreted world, an introduction to phenomenological psychology, 2nd edition. London, UK: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying the rule of epoché we sets aside our personal initial biases and prejudices in order to suspend expectations and assumptions. Applying the rule of description, one occupies oneself with describing instead of explaining. Applying the rule of horizontalization one treats each item of description as having equal value or significance.

When it comes to a socio-therapeutic relationship the rule of epoché sets aside any initial theories with regard to what is presented in the meeting between therapist and client. The rule of description implies immediate and specific observations, abstaining from interpretations or explanations, especially those formed from the application of any clinical theory superimposed over the circumstances of experience. The rule of horizontalization avoids any hierarchical assignment of importance such that the data of experience become prioritized and categorized as they are received. 

As envisioned by Husserl, phenomenology is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since [[Plato]] in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual's "lived experience".&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund. The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology. Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1970, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intersubjectivity===

Intersubjectivity emphasizes that shared understanding and consensus is essential in the shaping of our ideas, experiencing, and relations. Language, quintessentially, is viewed as communal rather than private. Therefore, it is problematic to view the individual as partaking in a private world, one which has a meaning defined apart from any other subjects. But in our shared divergence from a commonly understood experience, these private worlds naturally emerge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sociotherapyassociation.com&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sri Lankan Tamil history}}
'''Sri Lankan state-sponsored colonization schemes''' refers to the government program of settling mostly  farmers from the densely populated wet zone in the sparsely populated areas of the dry zone in the [[North Central Province, Sri Lanka|North Central Province]] and the [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern Province]] regions near [[Irrigation tank|tanks]] and [[reservoirs]] being built in major [[irrigation]] and hydro-power programs such as the Mahaweli project to create farming and fishing communities. Since irrigation settlements in the North Central and Eastern Provinces occurred under direct state sponsorship, as most of these farmers are ethnic [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] it appeared to many [[Tamils]] as a deliberate attempt of the Sinhalese-dominated state to marginalize them further by decreasing their numbers in the area. It has been perhaps the most immediate cause of inter-communal violence.&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-13257.html|title=Tamil Alienation|date=October 1988|work=Country Studies Series: Sri Lanka|publisher=Federal Research Division, [[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTSRILANKA/Resources/App1.pdf|title=The Root Causes of the Ethnic Conflict in Sri Lanka&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mahaweli.gov.lk/en/pdf/Library/Implementtion%20Strategy%20Study%20-%20Volume%205.pdf|title={{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

==Introduction==
Shortly after [[independence]], the government of [[Ceylon]] started a program to settle [[farmers]] in the [[jungles]] of [[Trincomalee District]]. The [[forests]] were cleared and water tanks restored. As a consequence of these schemes the Sinhalese population of Trincomalee District rose from 11,606 (15%) in 1946 to 85,503 (33%) in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangam.org/2008/05/Demographic_Changes.pdf|title=Demographic Changes in the Tamil Homeland in the Island of Sri Lanka Over the Last Century|date=April 2008|publisher=[[LTTE]] Peace Secretariat|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s the government extended the colonization schemes into the Dry Zone area of the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]], drawing up plans to settle up to 30,000 Sinhalese in .&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt;
colonization schemes also took place in the areas of [[Ampara District|Ampara]] and [[Batticaloa District|Batticaloa]] districts  where Sinhalese population rose from 61,996 in 1963 when the district was formed to 229,000 by 2007 according to Government census claims.&lt;ref name= stats&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statistics.gov.lk/PopHouSat/Preliminary%20Reports%20Special%20Enumeration%202007/Basic%20Population%20Information%20on%20Ampara%20District%202007.pdf | title=Population statistics in Amparai district in 2007 | accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of the "traditional Tamil homeland" became a potent component of popular Tamil
political imagination while the [[Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism|Sinhalese nationalist]] groups viewed the resettlement schemes in these areas as "reclamation and recreation in the present of the glorious Sinhalese Buddhist past". The Muslim community tended to reject the countervailing notion of a traditional Tamil homeland in the North East region which resulted in animosity between the Muslim and Tamil communities in the region to rise &lt;ref name="WB"/&gt;

==1950s==
The first colonisation scheme was at [[Kantalai Tank|Kanthalai Kulam (Kantale) tank]] where peasants from outside Trincomalee District were settled in the traditional Tamil village of Kanthalai, 39&amp;nbsp;km south-west of [[Trincomalee]] town.&lt;ref name="UTHR11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uthr.org/Reports/Report11/appendix2.htm|title=COLONISATION &amp; DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES  IN THE TRINCOMALEE DISTRICT AND   ITS  EFFECTS  ON THE TAMIL SPEAKING PEOPLE|date=15 April 1993|publisher=[[University Teachers for Human Rights|University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna)]]|accessdate=4 October 2009|work=Report 11, Apendix II}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=11946|title="ISGA needed as confidence building measure for final solution" - Sampanthan|date=9 May 2004|publisher=[[TamilNet]]|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 77% of settlers were Sinhalese and the rest were Tamils/Muslims.&lt;ref name="TC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilcanadian.com/page.php?cat=52&amp;id=3316|title=Part 3: Buddha’s statues symbol of Sinhalese Hegemony!|last=V.

A colonisation scheme was at Alai Kulam tank, 25&amp;nbsp;km south of Trincomalee town.&lt;ref name="UTHR11"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=10751|title=LTTE opposes land ministry mobile service in Kantalai|date=20 December 2003|publisher=[[TamilNet]]|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 65% of settlers were Sinhalese and the rest were Muslims.&lt;ref name="TC"/&gt;

The colonisation scheme was extended to Tamil speaking areas of [[Anuradhapura District]]. A scheme was started at Pathavik Kulam (Padaviya) tank, 65&amp;nbsp;km north-east of [[Anuradhapura]] town.&lt;ref name="UTHR11"/&gt; Parts of the scheme lay in Trincomalee District and as such were annexed to the Sinhalese dominated [[Anuradhapura District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilnation.org/indictment/genocide83/sampanthan.htm|title=Genocide in Sri Lanka|last=[[Rajavarothiam Sampanthan]]|year=1984|publisher=[[Tamil United Liberation Front]]|accessdate=4 October 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land Development Department employees from this scheme took part in the [[1958 riots in Ceylon|1958 anti-Tamil riots]].&lt;ref name="UTHR11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TC"/&gt;

==1960s==
In the 1961 a colonisation scheme was started at Muthali Kulam (Morawewa) tank, 24&amp;nbsp;km west of Trincomalee town.&lt;ref name="UTHR11"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=7948|title=SLAF occupation adds to Muthalikulam farmers' woes|date=8 December 2002|publisher=[[TamilNet]]|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s==
In the 1980s, funded by aid received from the [[European Community]], a colonisation scheme was started at Periya Vilankulam (Mahadiulwewa) tank, 30&amp;nbsp;km north-west of Trincomalee town.&lt;ref name="UTHR11"/&gt;

The colonisation scheme was extended into the Northern province with the introduction of the [[Manal Aru]] (Weli Oya) scheme, which covered the districts of [[Mullaitivu District|Mullaitivu]], Trincomalee, [[Vavuniya District|Vavuniya]] and Anuradhapura.&lt;ref name="P23"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangam.org/articles/view2/?uid=633|title=Chapter 23: Manal Aru becomes Weli Oya|last=T.

Sabaratnam|work=Pirapaharan|publisher=Ilankai Tamil Sangam|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This anger boiled over into violence when the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] [[Kent and Dollar Farm massacres|attacked]] the Kent and Dollar Farm settlement at Weli Oya, killing 62.&lt;ref name="P40"/&gt;

==1990s==
When the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]]s were withdrawn in 1990, Tamils homes in the suburbs of Trincomalee were occupied by Sinhalese settlers according to pro-rebel Tamilnet.Tens of thousands of landless Sinhala peasants were reported to have been brought in by the advancing SLF and made to occupy local villages and lands, denying resettlement to its original inhabitants who had earlier fled to the jungles due to the murder of Tamil civilians at the hands of the Army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=8920 Sinhalese settlements in Kokkulai Lagoon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=1741|title=Protests at Illegal Settlement|date=9 July 1998|publisher=[[TamilNet]]|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000s ==

Since the fall of the LTTE and the liberation of LTTE held areas several settlement programs were initiated by the government that extends towards the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]].In the Vavuniya district 3000 acres in Madukulam is being cleared for a village while work of a settlement is underway in the former LTTE stronghold of Othiyamalai Kaadu a settlement is being created in Rampaveddi bordering the minor tank area of Eropothana and new settlement of approximately 2500 ethnic Sinhala families (about 6000 people) from the South were settled in the village of Kokkachaankulam and the Hindu temple in the village was demolished and replaced with a Buddhist Stupa. Tamils in Barathypuram were evicted and a Muslim settlement is being created in the area due to the large economic opportunities provided by an apparels factory being built there.&lt;ref name="GV"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://groundviews.org/2013/09/05/why-is-land-a-fundamental-issue-to-the-tamils/|title = State facilitated colonization of northern sri lanka 2013|date = |accessdate = |website = GroundViews.org|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several new settlements are also being built in Mullaitivu District while the Weli Oya settlement is being expanded as well. Several fishing colonies are being built in the Mannar district and Muslim settlements have been built in lands previously owned by Tamils that fled to India during the war.
‘Navatkuli Housing Project’ is being built in Navatkuli, Jaffna District to house 135 Sinhalese families, including 54 families who had, in 2010, attempted to set up temporary residences at the Jaffna Railway Station with funding from Buddhist Organizations and Political parties.&lt;ref name="GV"/&gt;

[[Tamil nationalist]] website TamilNet reported that Tamils were being ethnically cleansed in the Jaffna peninsula and Mullativu districts supplemented by construction of Buddhist stupas and [[Sinhalisation]] of names of streets and places.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=32810&lt;/ref&gt; According to TamilNet the Tamil populace has reportedly been reduced to a fourth between 2007 and 2011 according to the Government enumeration.According to the website locals of both North and East complain of the state of waging an accelerated campaign of Sinhala Buddhist colonisation by destroying historic Hindu shrines in the East.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=35615&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=35315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=32145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=32702&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=32652&lt;/ref&gt; Over 400 families were reported to have been settled in Nelukkulam in Mullativu district by the website.&lt;ref name="tamilnet.com"&gt;http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=9654&lt;/ref&gt; Another incident of state colonization before the [[Eelam War IV|Final Eelam War]] was reported by Muslim residents of Pulmoddai village who claimed that several acres of their traditional land had been annexed by the Government for settlements from South on the pretext of industrial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslims allege Sinhala colonization in Pulmoddai|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=23369|work=[[TamilNet]]|date=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Nations General Assembly First Committee''' (also known as the '''Disarmament and International Security Committee''' or 
'''DISEC''') is one of six main committees at the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]].
It deals with [[disarmament]] and [[international security]] matters.

The First Committee meets every year in October for a 4–5 week session, after the General Assembly General Debate. All 193 member states of the UN can attend. It is the only Main Committee of the General Assembly entitled to verbatim records.

== Mandate ==
The work of the Committee falls under seven thematic clusters: &lt;ref name="Swiss Guidebook"&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The GA Handbook: A Practical Guide to the United Nations General Assembly |url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/dam/mission-new-york/en/documents/UN_GA__Final.pdf |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Permanent Mission of Switzerland to the United Nations |date=2017 |isbn=978-0-615-49660-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nuclear weapons
* Other weapons of mass destruction 
* Outer space (disarmament aspects) 
* Conventional weapons
* Regional disarmament and security
* Other disarmament measures and international security
* Disarmament machinery

== Working Methods ==
The work of the Committee usually begins in late September and ends by the end of October or early November. The work of the body is split into three stages: (1) general debate, (2) thematic discussions and (3) action on drafts.

During the first stage, the general debate, the Committee discusses its agenda items for around eight days. This period of debate is then followed by two weeks of thematic discussions on each of the seven clusters. During this stage, the body hears testimony from high-level officials in the field of arms control and disarmament. It also holds hearings in the form of interactive panel discussions with various representatives from disarmament entities. In the final stage, the body votes on any resolutions or decisions that it has drawn up during its session.&lt;ref name="Swiss Guidebook"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reporting Bodies ==
The Committee has two main bodies that report to it: the [[Disarmament Commission|Disarmament Commission (UNDC)]] and the [[Conference on Disarmament|Conference on Disarmament (CD)]].&lt;ref name="Swiss Guidebook"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Disarmament Commission meets yearly in New York for three weeks hosting both plenary meetings and working groups. The work of the Commission is usually divided between two working groups, with each group tackling one topic from the whole range of disarmament issues for that session, one of which must include nuclear disarmament. The Commission reports to the General Assembly via the First Committee at least once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disarmament/institutions/disarmament-commission/ |title=United Nations Disarmament Commission |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs |publisher=United Nations |access-date=21 November 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Conference on Disarmament is not formally part of the United Nations machinery, it still reports to the General Assembly annually, or more frequently, as appropriate. Its budget is also included in that of the United Nations. The Conference meets in Geneva triannually and focuses on the following issues:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/(httpPages)/BF18ABFEFE5D344DC1256F3100311CE9?OpenDocument |title=An Introduction to the Conference |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=United Nations Office at Geneva |publisher=United Nations |access-date=21 November 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament 
* Prevention of nuclear war
* Prevention of an arms race in outer space
* Effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons 
* New types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons including radiological weapons 
* Comprehensive programme of disarmament and transparency in armaments 

The Committee also hears reports from any expert groups established they establish.

      <comment>/* Merkel's use of phrase */ update with ref</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4207">"'''Wir schaffen das'''" ("we can manage this; we can do it; we can do this") is an assertion made by German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] during the 2015 [[European migrant crisis]] that Germany could manage to absorb very large numbers of immigrants.  It subsequently came into wide use by politicians and activists opposed to mass immigration, intending criticism of Merkel's immigration policy.

==Merkel's use of phrase==
Merkel first used the phrase on 31 August 2015, at a press conference following a visit to a refugee camp near [[Dresden]] where local opponents of her [[open borders]] policy booed and heckled her.&lt;ref name="DelckerPhrase"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delcker|first1=Janosch|title=The phrase that haunts Angela Merkel|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/the-phrase-that-haunts-angela-merkel/|accessdate=9 April 2018|publisher=Politico|date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full sentence she used was ''"Wir haben so vieles geschafft – wir schaffen das.”''  This can be translated as "We have managed so many things — we will also manage this situation."&lt;ref name="DelckerPhrase"/&gt;

Merkel used the phrase against a background of violence and crime by and against immigrants in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.is/wiHMz|title=Ermittlungen zum Münchner Amoklauf abgeschlossen|website=Landescriminalamt Bayern|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including the [[2016 Munich shooting]], the [[2016 Ansbach bombing]], and the [[Würzburg train attack]].&lt;ref name="AfterRampages"&gt;{{cite news|title=After rampages, Merkel says again: Wir schaffen das|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20160728/merkel-says-again-wir-schaffen-das|accessdate=9 April 2018|agency=AFP|publisher=The Local|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, Merkel stated that she would no longer be using the phrase. In an interview with the German paper, ''Wirtschaftswoche'', she said "I sometimes think this phrase was a little overstated, that too much store was set by it — to the extent that I’d prefer not to repeat it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-drops-the-we-can-do-it-slogan-catchphrase-migration-refugees/|title=Angela Merkel drops the ‘we can do it’ slogan|date=17 September 2016|website=Politico|author=Emmet Livingstone|access-date=3 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of phrase by other politicians==
Two weeks after the press conference where Merkel first used the phrase, opponents began to use it to criticize her pro-immigration policy.&lt;ref name="DelckerPhrase"/&gt; In August 2018, one of the vice presidents of the German [[Bundestag]], [[Wolfgang Kubicki]] ([[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]), stated that the dictum was at the [[2018 Chemnitz stabbing attack|"root of the violence" in Chemnitz]]. [[SPD]]-chairwoman and SPD group leader in the Bundestag, [[Andrea Nahles]], called this an "unbelievable statement for an experienced politician".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2018-08/sachsen-chemnitz-andrea-nahles-wolfgang-kubicki Wolfgang Kubicki wegen Aussagen zu Chemnitz in der Kritik], Zeit.de, 29 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Graeme Wood (journalist)|Graeme Wood]] describes "the anti-immigrant right" as having "hung 'Wir schaffen das' around (Merkel's) neck like a lead weight."&lt;ref name="WoodDetectives"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Graeme|title=The Refugee Detectives|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/the-refugee-detectives/554090/|accessdate=9 April 2018|publisher=The Atlantic|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 November 2018, CDU Secretary General [[Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer]], a [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany leadership election, 2018|candidate for succeeding Angela Merkel]] as CDU party chairwoman, used the phrase several times during a party conference, referring, not to asylum seekers but to family policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/merkels-erbe/kramp-karrenbauer-wiederholt-merkels-umstrittensten-satz-15916979.html Kramp-Karrenbauer wiederholt Merkels umstrittensten Satz], Frankfurter Allgemeine, 30 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11098">'''Women in development''' is an approach of development projects that emerged in the 1969s, calling for treatment of women's issues in development projects. It is the integration of women into the global economies by improving their status and assisting in total development.   Later, the [[Gender and development]] (GAD) approach proposed more emphasis on gender relations rather than seeing women's issues in isolation.{{sfn|Van Marle|2006|p=125}}

==Concepts==

In Africa, one of the first to recognise the importance of women in farming was [[Hermann Baumann (social anthropologist)|Hermann Baumann]] in 1928, with his classic article ''The Division of Work According to Sex in African Hoe Culture''. Kaberry published a much-quoted study of women in the Cameroon in 1952, and empirical data on male and female activities was documented in ''Nigerian Cocoa Farmers'' published in 1956 by Galletti, Baldwin and Dina.{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=200}}
[[Ester Boserup]]'s pioneering ''Women's Role in Economic Development'' brought greater attention to the importance of women's role in agricultural economies and the lack of alignment of development projects with this reality.{{sfn|Shifting views...}}
In the preface to her book, Boserup wrote that "in the vast and ever-growing literature on economic development, reflections on the particular problems of women are few and far between".{{sfn|Bolles|1999|p=23}}
She showed that women often did more than half the agricultural work, in one case as much as 80%, and that they also played an important role in trade.{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=200}}

In other countries, women were severely underemployed. According to the 1971 census in India, women constituted 48.2% of the population but only 13% of economic activity. Women were excluded from many types of formal job, so 94% of the female workforce was engaged in the unorganized sector employed in agriculture, agro-forestry, fishery, handicrafts and so on.{{sfn|Pattnaik|1996|p=42}}
With growing awareness of women's issues, in the 1970s development planners began to try to integrate women better into their projects to make them more productive.{{sfn|Shifting views...}} 
The WID approach initially accepted existing social structures in the recipient country and looked at how to better integrate women into existing development initiatives.{{sfn|Taylor|1999|p=15}}
The straightforward goal was to increase the productivity and earnings of women.{{sfn|Campillo|p=34}}

==Activities==

The [[United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP) established a special Division for Women in Development, promoting concrete action to ensure that women participate in UNDP projects.{{sfn|Agrawal|Aggarwal|1996|p=371}}
The United Nations paper ''International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade'', issued in 1980, recognized a number of Women in Development issues. It called for women to play an active role in all sectors and at all levels of the Program of Action adopted by the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women, both as agents and beneficiaries. Policies on industrialization, food and agriculture, science and technology and social development should all involve women.{{sfn|Joekes|1990|pp=147ff}}

A 1985 report by the OECD Development Center surveyed a broad sample of development projects aimed at women.  It concluded that many were too welfare-oriented. It said "future projects should avoid the home economics approach and focus on income-generating activities which are relevant and useful to the women participating". It also noted the lack of information about women's roles and activities, and called for greater research as input to development projects.{{sfn|Weekes-Vagliani|1985|pp=52ff}}

The [[Harvard Analytical Framework]] attempted to address these concerns.
The framework has its origins in 1980 with a request to [[Harvard University]] for WID training from the [[World Bank]]. James Austin, who was well known for case-method training at Harvard, led a team with three women experienced in WID work: [[Catherine Overholt]], Mary Anderson and Kathleen Cloud.  These became known as the "Harvard Team".{{sfn|Moser|2002|p=174}}
The framework was elaborated by the [[Harvard Institute for International Development]] in collaboration with the WID office of [[USAID]], and was first described in 1984 by Catherine Overholt and others. It was one of the earliest of such frameworks.{{sfn|Ochola|Sanginga|Bekalo|2010|pp=238–239}}
The starting point for the framework was the assumption that it makes economic sense for development aid projects to allocate resources to women as well as men, which will make development more efficient – a position named the "efficiency approach".{{sfn|Gender Analysis...}}

In November 1990 the leaders of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) countries endorsed recommendations of the second SAARC ministerial meeting of Women in Development held in June 1990, agreeing that the years 1991–2000 should be observed as the "SAARC Decade of the Girl Child". A wide range of recommendations for improving the development of female children were accepted.{{sfn|Agrawal|Aggarwal|1996|p=210}}

==Criticism==

The validity of the basic assumptions of the WID approach have been criticized by some, while other consider that it does not go far enough.{{sfn|Ascher|2001|pp=89–90}}
The latter group says it ignores the larger social processes that affect women's lives and their reproductive roles.{{sfn|Shifting views...}}
The approach does not address the root causes of gender inequalities.{{sfn|Taylor|1999|p=20}}
The Gender and Development (GAD) approach in the 1980s attempted to redress the problem, using [[gender analysis]] to develop a broader view.{{sfn|Shifting views...}}
The approach is more concerned with relationships, the way in which men and women participate in development processes, rather than strictly focusing on women's issues.{{sfn|Campillo|p=34}}

In a 1988 paper ''Women in Development: Defining the Issues'' for the [[World Bank]], Paul Collier argued that gender-neutral public policies may be inadequate, and gender-specific policies may be required to more effectively alleviate problems.{{sfn|Collier|1988}}
In at least some countries, women have become increasingly involved in financial budgeting and management and since the 1995 Beijing Conference on Women there has been a surge in gender-responsive budgeting.{{sfn|D'Agostino|Levine|2010|pp=141ff}}

[[File:YellowTerror.jpg|thumb|350px|''The Yellow Terror in all His Glory'' (1899) is a rebellious [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]] Chinese man, armed to the teeth, who stands astride a fallen white woman representing Western European [[colonialism]].]]
The '''Yellow Peril''' (also '''Yellow Terror''' and '''Yellow Spectre''') is a [[color terminology for race|racist color-metaphor]] that is integral to the [[xenophobic]] theory of [[colonialism]]: that the peoples of [[East Asia]] are a danger to the [[Western world]]. As a psycho-cultural perception of menace from the East, fear of the Yellow Peril was more racial than national, a fear derived, not from concern with a specific source of danger, from any one country or people, but from a vaguely ominous, [[existential]] fear of the vast, faceless, nameless horde of yellow people opposite the Western world. As a form of [[xenophobia]], the Yellow Terror is the  fear of [[The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy|the rising tide of colored people]] from the Orient.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite web| last = Yang| first = Tim| authorlink=|title = The Malleable Yet Undying Nature of the Yellow Peril| work =| publisher = Dartmouth College|date= 19 February 2004| url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~hist32/History/S22%20-The%20Malleable%20Yet%20Undying%20Nature%20of%20the%20Yellow%20Peril.htm| accessdate = 18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racist ideology of the Yellow Peril is a "core imagery of apes, lesser men, primitives, children, madmen, and beings who possessed special powers", which are [[Representation (arts)|cultural representations]] of colored people that originated in the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Græco–Persian Wars]] (499–449 BC), between Ancient Greece and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]; centuries later, Western imperialist expansion included East Asians to the Yellow Peril.&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dower, John. "Patterns of a Race War" pp. 283–87, in ''Yellow Peril! An Archive of anti–Asian Fear'', John Kuo Wei Tchen &amp; Dylan Yeats, Eds. London: Verso, 2014 pp. 285–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, the Russian sociologist Jacques Novikow coined the phrase in his essay "Le Péril Jaune" ("The Yellow Peril", 1897); later, Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] of Germany used Yellow Peril racism to encourage the European empires to invade, conquer, and colonize China.&lt;ref&gt;John Röhl. ''The Kaiser and His Court: Wilhelm II and the Government of Germany'', Cambridge University Press, 1994. p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, the Kaiser misrepresented the Asian victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–05) as a [[Racialism|racialist]] threat to the white citizens of Western Europe, and misrepresented China and Japan in alliance to [[Slavery|conquer and subjugate]] the Western world.

The [[Sinology|sinologist]] Wing-Fai Leung explained the fantastic origins of the phrase and racialist ideology: "The phrase yellow peril (sometimes yellow terror or yellow spectre) ... blends Western anxieties about sex, racist fears of the alien [[Other (philosophy)|other]], and the Spenglerian belief that the West will become outnumbered and enslaved by the East."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Leung| first = Wing Fai | title = Perceptions of the East – Yellow Peril: An Archive of Anti-Asian Fear| work = The Irish Times |date= 16 August 2014 | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/perceptions-of-the-east-yellow-peril-an-archive-of-anti-asian-fear-1.1895696| accessdate = 4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic Gina Marchetti identified the psycho-cultural fear of Asians as "rooted in medieval fears of [[Genghis Khan]] and the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongolian invasions of Europe]], the Yellow Peril combines racist terror of alien cultures, sexual anxieties, and the belief that the West will be overpowered and enveloped, by the irresistible, dark, occult forces of the East";&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|2}} hence, in light of [[Empire of Japan|Japanese imperial militarism]], the West included Japanese people to Yellow Peril racism.

==Origins==
The racist and cultural stereotypes of the Yellow Peril originated in the late 19th century, when Chinese workers (people of different skin-color, physiognomy, language and culture) legally immigrated to Australia, Canada, the U.S. and New Zealand, where they inadvertently provoked a racist backlash against themselves, for agreeing to work for lower wages, than the local white populations. In 1870, the French [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] and historian [[Ernest Renan]] had warned Europeans of Eastern danger to the West, yet Renan had meant the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]] (1721–1917), a nation whom the West perceived as more Asiatic than European.&lt;ref name="Tsu, Jiang 2005 p. 80"&gt;Tsu, Jiang.

;Imperial Germany
[[File:Voelker Europas.jpg|thumb|400px|Kaiser Wilhelm II used the allegorical lithograph ''Peoples of Europe, Guard Your Most Sacred Possessions'' (1895), by [[Hermann Knackfuss]], to promote Yellow Peril ideology as geopolitical justification for European colonialism in China.]]

Since 1870, in the practise of colonial imperialism, the stereotypes of Yellow Peril ideology gave [[Reification (Marxism)|concrete form]] to the anti-Asian racism that was cultural-currency in the Western [[worldview]] of Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="Tsu, Jiang 2005 p. 80"/&gt; In central Europe, the Orientalist and diplomat [[Max von Brandt]] advised Kaiser Wilhelm II that Imperial Germany had colonial interests to pursue in China.&lt;ref name="Iikura 2006"&gt;Akira, Iikura.

Spang and Rolf-Harald Wippich, Eds. London: Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|83}} Hence, the Kaiser used the phrase ''die Gelbe Gefahr'' (The Yellow Peril) to specifically encourage Imperial German interests and justify European colonialism in China.&lt;ref&gt;Rupert, G. G. ''The Yellow Peril or, the Orient versus the Occident'', Union Publishing, 1911. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, Germany, France, and Russia staged the [[Triple Intervention]] to the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] (17 April 1895), which concluded the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895), in order to compel [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] to surrender their Chinese colonies to the Europeans; that geopolitical gambit became an underlying ''[[casus belli]]'' of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–05).&lt;ref name="Iikura 2006"/&gt;{{rp|83}}&lt;ref name= Kowner&gt;Kowner. ''Historical Dictionary of the Russo–Japanese War'', p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaiser justified the Triple Intervention to the Japanese empire with [[racialism|racialist]] calls-to-arms against non-existent geopolitical dangers of the "yellow race" against the "white race" of Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Iikura 2006"/&gt;{{rp|83}}

To justify European [[cultural hegemony]], the Kaiser used the allegorical lithograph ''Peoples of Europe, Guard Your Most Sacred Possessions'' (1895), by [[Hermann Knackfuss]], to communicate his geopolitics to other European monarchs. The lithograph depicts Germany as the leader of Europe,&lt;ref name="Tsu, Jiang 2005 p. 80"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane, Daniel C. introduction to ''Au Japon, Memoirs of a Foreign Correspondent in Japan, Korea, and China, 1892–1894'', de Guerville, A.B.

;Imperial Russia
In the late 19th century, with the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)]], the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) China recovered the eastern portion of the [[Ili River]] basin ([[Zhetysu]]), which Russia had occupied for a decade, since the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Atlas of the 19th Century World, 1783–1914|url=|year=1998|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books|isbn=978-0-7607-3203-8|page=5.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/TSENG_CHI-TSE.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Scott|title=China and the International System, 1840–1949: Power, Presence, and Perceptions in a Century of Humiliation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6U_DPS4vfO0C&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=7 November 2008|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7742-7|pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that time, the mass communications media of the West misrepresented China as an ascendant military power, and applied Yellow Peril ideology to evoke racist fears that China would conquer Western colonies, such as Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Scott|title=China and the International System, 1840–1949: Power, Presence, and Perceptions in a Century of Humiliation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6U_DPS4vfO0C&amp;pg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=7 November 2008|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7742-7|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;United States
In 1870s California, despite the [[Burlingame Treaty]] (1868) that allowed legal migration of unskilled labourers from China, the native working-class white people demanded that the U.S government cease the immigration of "filthy yellow hordes" of Chinese people who took jobs from native-born white-Americans, especially during an [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]].&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt; In that vein, [[Horace Greeley]], editor of the ''New-York Tribune'' newspaper, wrote a xenophobic and racist editorial opinion supporting the popularly demanded exclusion:

{{Quotation|The Chinese are uncivilized, unclean, and filthy beyond all conception, without any of the higher domestic or social relations; lustful and sensual in their dispositions; every female is a prostitute of the basest order".&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt;}}

In Los Angeles, Yellow Peril racism provoked the [[Chinese Massacre of 1871 (Los Angeles)|Chinese Massacre of 1871]], wherein 500 white men [[Lynching|lynched]] 20 Chinese men in the Chinatown ghetto. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, the leader of the [[Workingmen's Party of California]], the Irish-born [[Denis Kearney]] was an extraordinary demagogue who successfully applied Yellow Peril ideology to his politics against the press, capitalists, politicians, and Chinese workers,&lt;ref&gt;McLain, Charles J. ''In Search of Equality: The Chinese Struggle Against Discrimination in Nineteenth-Century America'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994; p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded his speeches with the epilogue: "and whatever happens, the Chinese must go!"&lt;ref name=G111&gt;Gyory, Andrew.

An Archive of anti-Asian Fear'' London: Verso, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|349}} Hence, by 1882, the political pressure of white xenophobia (nativist and populist) compelled the U.S. government to legislate the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] (1882), which remained the effective immigration-law until 1943.&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt;

==The Boxer Rebellion==
{{main article|Boxer Rebellion}}

In 1900, the anti-colonial [[Boxer Rebellion]] (August 1899 – September 1901) reinforced the racist stereotypes of Asian people as a Yellow Peril to white people. The Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists (the Boxers) was a xenophobic martial-arts organization who blamed the problems of China on the presence of Western colonies in China proper. The Boxers sought to save China by killing every Western colonist and Chinese Christian – Westernized Chinese people.&lt;ref name="Preston 2000"&gt;Preston, Diana ''The Boxer Rebellion'', New York: Berkley Books, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|350}} In early summer of 1900, Prince [[Zaiyi]] allowed the Boxers into Beijing, to kill Western colonists and Chinese Christians, in siege to the foreign legations.&lt;ref name="Preston 2000"/&gt;{{rp|78–79}} Afterwards, [[Ronglu]], Qing Commander-in-Chief, and [[Yikuang, Prince Qing]], resisted and expelled the Boxers from Beijing after days of fighting.

===Western perception===
[[File:BoxerSoldiers.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Yellow Peril xenophobia arose from the armed revolt of the Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists (the Boxers) to expel European colonists from China, during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] (August 1899 – September 1901)]]

Most of the victims of the Boxer Rebellion were Chinese Christians, but the massacres of Chinese people were of no interest to the West, who demanded Asian blood to avenge the Western colonists killed by rebellious Chinese natives.&lt;ref name="A righteous fist"&gt;{{cite news | title = A Righteous Fist | work = The Economist |date= 16 December 2010| url = http://www.economist.com/node/17723014 | accessdate = 18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Great Britain, the U.S., Imperial Japan, France, Imperial Russia, Imperial Germany, Austria–Hungary, and Italy formed the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]], and despatched an international military expeditionary force to end the [[Siege of the International Legations]] in Beijing.

In the Russian press, Yellow Peril ideology misrepresented anti-colonial revolt (the Boxer Rebellion) in racialist and religious terms: A cultural war between White Holy Russia and Yellow Pagan China. The press further supported the Yellow Peril apocalypse with quotations from the Sinophobic poems of the philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]].&lt;ref name="Eskridge-Kosmach 2014"&gt;Eskridge-Kosmach, Alena. "Russian Press and the Ideas of Russia's 'Special Mission in the East' and 'Yellow Peril' ", pp. 661–75, ''[[Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]'', Volume 27, November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|664}} Likewise in the press, the aristocracy demanded action against the Asian threat; Prince [[Sergei Nikolaevich Trubetskoy]] urged Imperial Russia and other European monarchies to jointly partition China, and end the Yellow Peril to Christendom.&lt;ref name="Eskridge-Kosmach 2014"/&gt;{{rp|664–665}} Hence, on 3 July 1900, in response to the Boxer Rebellion, Russia expelled the Chinese community (5,000 people) from [[Blagoveshchensk]]; then, during the 4–8 July period, the Tsarist police, Cossack cavalry, and local vigilantes killed the expelled Chinese at the Amur River.&lt;ref&gt;Олег Анатольевич Тимофеев (Oleg Anatolyevich Timofeyev). [http://www.igpi.ru/center/lib/hist_tradit/east/china/Timofeyev2.html "Российско-китайские отношения в Приамурье (сер. XIX – нач. XX вв.)"] ''Russian–Chinese relations in the Amur region, Mid–19th – Early–20th centuries'' Part 2. Blagoveshchensk (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, news of Boxer atrocities against Western colonists stirred anti-Asian racism in Europe and North America, where that anti-colonial revolt was mis-perceived as a [[Ethnic conflict|race war]], between the yellow race and the white race. Historically, Yellow Peril ideology recycles Boxer-Rebellion atrocities as false-proof that "Boxerism" (innate, murderous hatred of Westerners) is a Chinese cultural trait.&lt;ref name="A righteous fist"/&gt; In that vein, the article "A Righteous Fist" (''The Economist'', 1905) warned the Western reader that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The history of the Boxer movement contains abundant warnings, as to the necessity of an attitude of constant vigilance, on the part of the European Powers, when there are any symptoms that a wave of nationalism is about to sweep over the Celestial Empire.&lt;ref name="A righteous fist"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hence, 61 years later, in 1967, during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] attacked the British Embassy and beat diplomats, to the home country, the embassy staff explained the political violence as an outbreak of ''Boxerism'', which is an innate, cultural characteristic of the Chinese people.&lt;ref name="A righteous fist"/&gt;

===Exhortation to barbarism===
[[File:Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany - 1902.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Kaiser Wilhelm II used Yellow Peril ideology as geopolitical justification for Imperial German and European imperialism in China.]]

[[File:China imperialism cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''China: The Cake of Kings and . . . of Emperors'': An angry [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin bureaucrat]] watches Queen Victoria ([[British Empire]]), Kaiser Wilhelm II ([[German Empire]]), Tsar Nicholas II ([[Russian Empire]]), [[Marianne]] ([[Third French Republic]]), and a Samurai ([[Empire of Japan]]) discuss their partitioning of China into colonies.&lt;ref&gt;''"En Chine Le gâteau des Rois et . . . des Empereurs"'' – Cartoon, [[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]], 16 January 1898; English: "China – the cake of kings and . . . of emperors"&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

On 27 July 1900, Kaiser Wilhelm II gave the racist ''Hunnenrede'' (Hun speech) exhorting his soldiers to barbarism; that Imperial German soldiers depart Europe for China and suppress the Boxer Rebellion, by acting like "Huns" and [[War crimes|committing atrocities]] against the Chinese (Boxer and civilian):&lt;ref name="Röhl 1996"/&gt;{{rp|203}}

{{quote|When you come before the enemy, you must defeat him, pardon will not be given, prisoners will not be taken! Whoever falls into your hands will fall to your sword! Just as a thousand years ago the Huns, under their King Attila, made a name for themselves with their ferocity, which tradition still recalls; so may the name of Germany become known in China in such a way that no Chinaman will ever dare look a German in the eye, even with a squint!&lt;ref name="Röhl 1996"/&gt;{{rp|14}}}}

Fearful of harm to the public image of Imperial Germany, the ''[[Auswärtiges Amt]]'' (Foreign Office) published a redacted version of the Hun Speech, expurgated of the exhortation to racist barbarism. Annoyed by Foreign-Office censorship, the Kaiser published the unexpurgated Hun Speech, which "evoked images of a Crusade and considered the current crisis [the Boxer Rebellion] to amount to a war between Occident and Orient." Yet that "elaborate accompanying music, and the new ideology of the Yellow Peril stood in no relation to the actual possibilities and results" of geopolitical policy based upon racist misperception.&lt;ref name="Mombauer 2003"&gt;Mombauer, Annika.

Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0521824088}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96}}

;Barbaric policy
The Kaiser ordered the expedition-commander, Field Marshal [[Alfred von Waldersee]], to behave barbarously, because the Chinese were, "by nature, cowardly, like a dog, but also deceitful."&lt;ref name="Mombauer 2003"/&gt;{{rp|99}} In that time, the Kaiser's best friend, [[Philip, Prince of Eulenburg|Prince Philip von Euenburg]] wrote to another friend that the Kaiser wanted to raze Beijing, and kill the populace to avenge the murder of Baron [[Clemens von Ketteler]], Imperial Germany's minister to China.&lt;ref name="Röhl 1996"/&gt;{{rp|13}} Only the Eight-Nation Alliance's refusal of barbarism to resolve the siege of the legations, saved the Chinese populace of Beijing from the massacre recommended by Imperial Germany.&lt;ref name="Röhl 1996"/&gt;{{rp|13}} In August 1900, an international military-force of Russian, Japanese, British, French, and American soldiers captured Beijing, before the German force arrived to the city.&lt;ref name="Mombauer 2003"/&gt;{{rp|107}}

;Vengeance
The Eight-Nation Alliance sacked Beijing in vengeance for the Boxer Rebellion; the magnitude of the rape, pillaging, and burning indicated "a sense that the Chinese were less than human" to the Western militaries.&lt;ref name="Preston 2000"/&gt;{{rp|286}} About the sacking of the city, an Australian colonist said: "The future of the Chinese is a fearful problem. Look at the frightful sights one sees in the streets of Peking. . . . See the filthy, tattered rags they wrap around them. Smell them as they pass. Hear of their nameless immorality. Witness their shameless indecency, and picture them among your own people – Ugh! It makes you shudder!"&lt;ref name="Preston 2000"/&gt;{{rp|350}}

British admiral [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Roger Keyes]] recalled that: "Every Chinaman . . . was treated as a Boxer, by the Russian and French troops, and the slaughter of men, women, and children in retaliation was revolting".&lt;ref name="Preston 2000"/&gt;{{rp|284}} The American colonist Luella Miner reported that "the conduct of the Russian soldiers is ''atrocious'', the French are not much better, and the Japanese are looting and burning without mercy. Women and girls, by the hundreds, have committed suicide to escape a worse fate at the hands of Russian and Japanese brutes."&lt;ref name="Preston 2000"/&gt;{{rp|284}}

British soldiers threatened to kill a Chinese old man, unless he gave them his treasure. On learning he had no treasure, a rifleman prepared to bayonet the old man dead.&lt;ref name="Preston 2000"/&gt;{{rp|284}} That rifleman was stopped by another soldier, who told him: "No, not that way! I'm going to shoot him. I've always had a longing to see what sort of wound a dum-dum [bullet] will make, and by Christ, I am going to try one on this blasted Chink!"&lt;ref name="Preston 2000"/&gt;{{rp|284}} After shooting the Chinese old man in the face, the British soldier exclaimed: "Christ, the dum-dum has blown the back out of his bloody nut!"&lt;ref name="Preston 2000"/&gt;{{rp|284}} Moreover, the British journalist George Lynch said, "there are things that I must not write, and that may not be printed in England, which would seem to show that this Western civilization of ours is merely a veneer over savagery".&lt;ref name="Preston 2000"/&gt;{{rp|285}}

;Barbaric praxis
The German expedition of Field Marshal Waldersee arrived in China on 27 September 1900, after the military defeat of the Boxer Rebellion by the Eight Nation Alliance; yet he launched 75 punitive raids into northern China to search for and destroy the remaining Boxers. The punitive German soldiers killed more peasants than Boxer guerrillas, because, by autumn 1900, the Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists posed no threat, military or political.&lt;ref name="Mombauer 2003"/&gt;{{rp|109}} On 19 November 1900, the Kaiser's military gambit in China was criticized as shameful to Germany; in the ''Reichstag'', the German Social Democrat politician [[August Bebel]] criticized the imperial war against the Boxers:

{{quote|No, this is no crusade, no holy war; it is a very ordinary war of conquest. . . . A campaign of revenge as barbaric as has never been seen in the last centuries, and not often at all in History . . . not even with the Huns, not even with the Vandals. . . . That is not a match for what the German and other troops of foreign powers, together with the Japanese troops, have done in China.&lt;ref name="Mombauer 2003"/&gt;{{rp|97}}}}

==Cultural fear==
The political praxis of Yellow Peril racism features a call for apolitical racial-unity among white people. To resolve a contemporary problem (economic, social, political) the racialist politician calls for white unity against the non-white Other who threatens from Asia. Despite their military defeat of the anti-colonial Boxer Rebellion, in the Western world, white racial-fear of Chinese nationalism became established as a cultural fear: That the Chinese race mean to invade, vanquish, and subjugate the Christian civilisation of the Western world.&lt;ref name="Preston 2000"/&gt;{{rp|350–351}}

In July 1900, the [[Völkisch movement|''Völkisch'' movement]] intellectual [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], the "Evangelist of Race", gave his racialist perspective of the cultural meaning of the [[Boer War]] (1899–1902) in relation to the Boxer Rebellion: "One thing I can clearly see, that is, that it is criminal for Englishmen and Dutchmen to go on murdering each other, for all sorts of sophisticated reasons, while the Great Yellow Danger overshadows us white men, and threatens destruction."&lt;ref name="Field 1981"&gt;Field, Geoffrey. ''The Evangelist of Race: The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York:Columbia University Press, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|357}}

===Racial annihilation===
The Yellow Peril [[racialism]] of the Austrian philosopher [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] (a founder of [[Gestalt psychology]]) proposed that the West and the East were in a [[Social Darwinism|Darwinian]] racial struggle for world domination, which the yellow race was winning.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dickinson |first=Edward Ross |title=Sex, Masculinity, and the 'Yellow Peril': Christian von Ehrenfels' Program for a Revision of the European Sexual Order, 1902–1910 |pages=255–284 |journal=[[German Studies Review]] |volume=25 |issue=2 |year=2002 |doi=10.2307/1432992 |jstor=1432992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|258}} That [[monogamy]] was a legalistic hindrance to global white-supremacy, for limiting a genetically superior white man to father children with only one woman; that in [[polygamy]], the yellow race had greater reproductive advantage, for permitting a genetically superior Asian man to father children with many women.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|258–261}}

Ehrenfels dismissed the Chinese as a racially inferior people whose Oriental culture lacked "all potentialities . . . determination, initiative, productivity, invention, and organizational talent" innate to the white culture of the Western world.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|263}} Contradictorily, despite having essentialized the Chinese into a listless mass of mindless Asians, Ehrenfels praised Japan as a first-rate [[Power projection|military power]], whose inevitable conquest of China would improve the racial breeds native to China. That through selective breeding with "genetically superior" Chinese women, the Japanese would create a race of "healthy, sly, cunning coolies", because the Chinese are virtuosos of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|263}} The essence of Ehrenfels's [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] racism was that Asian conquest of the West equalled racial annihilation. Europe invaded, conquered, and subjugated by a Sino–Japanese army of genetically superior soldiers in a race war that the Western powers (imperial and democratic) would be unable to thwart or win.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|263}}

;Polygamous patriarchy
To resolve the demographic imbalance between the East and the West, Ehrenfels proposed politically radical changes to the structures of European society, such as [[State (polity)|State]] control of human sexuality, by way of polygamy, which would ensure the procreation of a numerically and genetically superior nation of white people. Only white men of high economic and genetic status would legally be allowed to father children.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|261–262}} Despite such radical changes to male sexual mores, women remained monogamous by law, culturally limited to the wife-and-mother social identity established in monogamous Christian patriarchy.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|261–262}}

In Ehrenfels's polygamous patriarchy, women reside in communal barracks, where they collectively rear children. The State assigns each woman a husband for [[conjugal visit]]s, solely for reproductive sexual-intercourse.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|261–262}} The number of wives that a white man might have is determined by his socio-economic status, hence ensuring that only the "social winners" can transmit and perpetuate their genes.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|262}} In such a [[White supremacy|white-supremacist]] society the man-and-woman relationship is reduced to the function of reproduction; [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] is divorced from sexual intercourse in service to male white-supremacy.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|262}}

;Race war
To end the Yellow Peril, Ehrenfels proposed that the white nations of the world unite to conquer the nations of Asia, before it became infeasible, in order to create a new racial order for the world, which would feature an hereditary [[caste]] system headed by white people.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|264}} Worldwide, an Aryan oligarchy (white people) would form and populate the ruling castes of the military and of the [[intelligentsia]] status-class, whilst the yellow-skin and the black-skin races would occupy the slave castes of their respective societies.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|264}}

Ehrenfels believed that the racially pure society he proposed would be realised in the far-future, because "the Aryan will only respond to the imperative of sexual reform when the waves of the Mongolian tide are lapping around his neck".&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|263}} In light of the Japanese victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905, Ehrenfels said that such an Asian victory indicated "the absolute necessity of a radical sexual reform for the continued existence of the Western races of man . . . [the matter] has been raised from the level of discussion to the level of a scientifically proven fact".&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|263}}

;Sublimated anti-Semitism
In ''Sex, Masculinity, and the 'Yellow Peril': Christian von Ehrenfels' Program for a Revision of the European Sexual Order, 1902–1910'' (2002), the historian Edward Ross Dickinson said that Ehrenfels always used metaphors of deadly water to express his racism and fear of the Yellow Peril: A ''flood'' of Chinese upon the West; a Chinese ''torrent of mud'' drowning Europe; the Japanese as a ''polluting liquid''; and that white Europeans would not respond to such a racial menace until the ''waves'' of Asians reached the neck.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|271}}

Likewise, the historian [[Klaus Theweleit]] said that, in the [[interwar period]] (1918–39), the political and racialist writings of the ''[[Freikorps]]'', right-wing mercenaries, featured imagery of deadly water, in a time when "the Jews" and the Communists were the only political and cultural threats to the worldview of right-wing Europeans.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|271}} That the right-wing ''Freikorps'' were psychologically insecure men obsessed with masculinity, and with proving themselves hard men; the negative imagery of water they used, reflected fears of the physical softness of women; of the erotic; of love and [[emotional intimacy]]; and of human dependence – things that psychologically threatened to render them less manly.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|271}}

Moreover, Dickinson said that a man like Baron Christian von Ehrenfels likely suffered the same sexual anxieties about masculinity, as did the right-wing writers, whose works Theweleit examined, but that only Ehrenfels projected his sexual insecurity into Yellow Peril racism, rather than the usual [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] myth of [[Judeo-Bolshevism]], which is a racist prejudice more common to German culture.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2002"/&gt;{{rp|271}}

==Xenophobia==
===Germany and Russia===
From 1895, the Kaiser's government used Yellow Peril ideology to portray Imperial Germany as defender of the West against conquest from the East.&lt;ref name="Herwig 1997"&gt;Herwig, Holger.

{{quote|The 1890s had spawned in the West the spectre of the "Yellow Peril", the rise to world dominance of the Asian peoples. The evidence cited was Asian population growth, immigration to the West (America and Australia in particular), and increased Chinese settlement along the Russian border. These demographic and political fears were accompanied by a vague and ominous dread of the mysterious powers supposedly possessed by the initiates of Eastern religions. There is a striking German picture of the 1890s, depicting the dream that inspired Kaiser Wilhelm II to coin the term "Yellow Peril", that shows the union of these ideas. It depicts the nations of Europe, personified as heroic, but vulnerable female figures guarded by the Archangel Michael, gazing apprehensively towards a dark cloud of smoke in the East, in which rests an eerily calm Buddha, wreathed in flame....

Combined with this was a sense of the slow sinking of the ''Abendland'', the "Evening Land" of the West. This would be put most powerfully, by thinkers such as Oswald Spengler in ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (1918) and the Prussian philosopher [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck|Moeller van den Bruck]], a Russian-speaker obsessed with the coming rise of the East. Both called for Germany to join the "young nations" of Asia through the adoption of such supposedly Asiatic practices as collectivism, "inner barbarism", and despotic leadership. The identification of Russia with Asia would eventually overwhelm such sympathies, instead leading to a more-or-less straightforward association of Germany with the values of "The West", against the "Asiatic barbarism" of Russia. That was most obvious during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]] [1933–45], when virtually every piece of anti–Russian propaganda talked of the "Asiatic millions" or "Mongolian hordes", which threatened to over-run Europe, but the identification of the Russians as Asian, especially as ''Mongolian'', continued well into the [[Cold War]] era [1945–1991].&lt;ref name="Palmer 2009"/&gt;{{rp|30–31}}}}

[[File:HedwigManuscriptLiegnitz b.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The European collective memory of the Yellow Peril includes the Mongols' display of the severed head of King [[Henry II of Silesia]], in Liegnitz.]]
As his cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm knew that Tsar Nicholas shared his anti-Asian racism and believed he could persuade the Tsar to abrogate the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] (1894) and then to form a German–Russian alliance against Britain.&lt;ref name="McLean 2003"&gt;McLean, Roderick.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003 p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

====European memory of Mongols====
In the 19th century, the racial and cultural stereotypes of Yellow Peril ideology colored German perceptions of Russia as a nation more Asiatic that European.&lt;ref name="Palmer 2009"/&gt;{{rp|31}} The European folk memory of the 13th-century [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] made the word ''Mongol'' a cultural synonym for the "Asian culture of cruelty and insatiable appetite for conquest", which was especially personified by [[Genghis Khan]], leader of the [[Orda (organization)|Orda]], the Mongol Horde.&lt;ref name="Palmer 2009"/&gt;{{rp|57–58}}

Despite that justifying historical background, Yellow Peril racism was not universally accepted in the societies of Europe. French intellectual [[Anatole France]] said that Yellow Peril ideology was to be expected from a racist man such as the Kaiser. Inverting the racist premise of Asian invasion, France showed that European imperialism in Asia and Africa indicated that the European White Peril was the true threat to the world.&lt;ref name="Tsu, Jiang 2005 p. 80"/&gt; In his essay "The Bogey of the Yellow Peril" (1904), the British journalist [[Demetrius Charles Boulger]] said the Yellow Peril was racist hysteria for popular consumption.&lt;ref name="Tsu, Jiang 2005 p. 80"/&gt; Asian geopolitical dominance of the world is "the prospect, placed before the uninstructed reading public, is a revival of the Hun and Mongol terrors, and the names of [[Attila]] and Genghis are set out in the largest type to create feelings of apprehension. The reader is assured, in the most positive manner, that this is the doing of the enterprising nation of Japan".&lt;ref name="Iikura 2003"&gt;Iikura, Akira.

London: Routledge, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|225}} Throughout the successful imperial intrigues facilitated by Germany's Yellow Peril ideology, the Kaiser's true geopolitical target was Britain.&lt;ref name="Iikura 2003"/&gt;{{rp|225}}

===United Kingdom===
In 18th-century Britain, the Chinese were considered a civilised people, but British imperial expansion in the 19th century facilitated racialist hostility towards Asians. The Chinese people were stereotyped as an inherently-depraved and corrupt people.&lt;ref name="French"&gt;{{cite news | last = French  | first = Philip  | authorlink = Philip French  | title = The Yellow Peril: Dr Fu Manchu &amp; the Rise of Chinaphobia | work = The Observer|date= 20 October 2014| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/20/yellow-peril-fu-manchu-rise-chinaphobia-review-factors-fear-china| accessdate = 4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, there were exceptions to popular racism of the Yellow Peril. In May 1890, [[William Ewart Gladstone]] criticized anti–Chinese immigration laws in Australia for penalizing their hard worker virtues (diligence, thrift and integrity), instead of penalizing their vices (gambling and opium-smoking).&lt;ref name="Auerbach 2009"/&gt;{{rp|25}}

====Cultural temper====
In 1904, in a meeting about the Russian–Japanese War, King [[Edward VII]] heard the Kaiser complain that the Yellow Peril is "the greatest peril menacing... Christendom and European civilisation. If the Russians went on giving ground, the yellow race would, in twenty years time, be in Moscow and Posen".&lt;ref name="MacDonogh, Giles page 277"&gt;MacDonogh, Giles. ''The Last Kaiser'', New York:St. Martin's Press, 2003. p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Undiplomatically, the Kaiser criticised the British for siding with Japan against Russia, suggesting "race treason" as a motive. In reply to the Kaiser, King Edward said he "could not see it. The Japanese were an intelligent, brave and chivalrous nation, quite as civilised as the Europeans, from whom they only differed by the pigmentation of their skin".&lt;ref name="MacDonogh, Giles page 277"/&gt;
[[File:King Edward VII Vanity Fair 19 June 1902.jpg|thumb|right|Unlike the Kaiser of Germany, King Edward VII of Great Britain, did not see the Japanese as the Yellow Peril in the Russo–Japanese War. (1904–05)]]

The first British usage of the Yellow Peril phrase was in the ''Daily News'' (21 July 1900) report describing the [[Boxer Rebellion]] as "the yellow peril in its most serious form".&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; Then, the racism of British [[Sinophobia]], the fear of Chinese people, did not include all Asians since Britain had sided with Japan during the Russian–Japanese War, but France and Germany supported Russia.&lt;ref name="Jukes 2002"&gt;Jukes, Geoffrey. ''The Russo–Japanese War 1904–1905'', London: Osprey 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|91}} The reports of one British military observer, Captain [[William Pakenham (Royal Navy officer)|William Pakenham]] "tended to depict Russia as his enemy, not just Japan".&lt;ref name="Jukes 2002"/&gt;{{rp|91}}

About pervasive Sinophobia in Western culture, in ''The Yellow Peril: Dr Fu Manchu &amp; the Rise of Chinaphobia'' (2014), historian Julia Lovell noted:

{{quote|In the early decades of the 20th century, Britain buzzed with Sinophobia. Respectable middle-class magazines, tabloids and comics, alike, spread stories of ruthless Chinese ambitions to destroy the West. The Chinese master-criminal (with his "crafty yellow face twisted by a thin-lipped grin", dreaming of world domination) had become a staple of children's publications.&lt;br&gt;

In 1911, "The Chinese in England: A Growing National Problem" an article distributed around the Home Office, warned of "a vast and convulsive Armageddon to determine who is to be the master of the world, the white or yellow man." After the First World War, cinemas, theatres, novels, and newspapers broadcast visions of the "Yellow Peril" machinating to corrupt white society. In March 1929, the ''chargé d'affaires'', at London's Chinese legation, complained that no fewer than five plays, showing in the West End, depicted Chinese people in "a vicious and objectionable form".&lt;ref name="Lowell"&gt;{{cite news | last = Lowell| first = Julia | title = The Yellow Peril: Dr Fu Manchu &amp; the Rise of Chinaphobia| work = The Guardian |date= 30 October 2014| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/30/yellow-peril-dr-fu-manchu-rise-of-chinaphobia-christopher-frayling-review| accessdate = 4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Asian moral laxity====
In the British popular imagination, the Limehouse district of London was a centre of depravity and vice, sexual prostitution, [[opium]] smoking and gambling.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lowell"/&gt; The press warned of the dangers of [[miscegenation]] of Chinese men marrying British women as a racial threat to Britain, and it warned that [[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]] gangsters kidnapped British women into [[white slavery]], "a fate worse than death" in Western popular culture.&lt;ref name="Witchard"&gt;{{cite news | last = Witchard| first = Anne| title = Writing China: Anne Witchard on 'England's Yellow Peril'| work = Wall Street Journal |date= 13 November 2014| url = https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/11/13/writing-china-anne-witchard-on-englands-yellow-peril/| accessdate = 4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, at the start of the [[First World War]], the [[Defence of the Realm Act]] was amended to include the smoking of opium as grounds for deportation. In fact, that was a legalistic pretext for expelling the Chinese inhabitants of London from Britain proper.&lt;ref name="Witchard"/&gt; That anti–Chinese [[moral panic]] derived from the social reality that British women had acquired economic independence with war effort jobs and would engage in premarital sexual affairs, a cultural threat that offended Britain's conservative society.&lt;ref name="blog.lareviewofbooks.org"&gt;{{cite news| last = Witchard  | first = Anne  | title = Yellow Peril: Sinophobia and the Great War: a Q&amp;A with Dr. Anne Witchard  | work = Los Angeles Times|date= 4 February 2015| url = http://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/chinablog/yellow-peril-sinophobia-great-war-qa-dr-anne-witchard/| accessdate = 19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such racist fears of the Yellow Peril were European cultural prejudices projected onto the Chinese community of Britain for allegedly corrupting British women into premarital [[libertine|libertinism]].&lt;ref name="blog.lareviewofbooks.org"/&gt;

===United States===
====19th century====
In the US, Yellow Peril xenophobia was legalized with the [[Page Act of 1875]], the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, and the [[Geary Act]] of 1892. The Chinese Exclusion Act replaced the [[Burlingame Treaty]] (1868), which had encouraged Chinese migration to the US and provided that "citizens of the United States in China, of every religious persuasion, and Chinese subjects, in the United States, shall enjoy entire liberty of conscience, and shall be exempt from all disability or persecution, on account of their religious faith or worship, in either country", withholding only the right of naturalized citizenship.

In the Western US, the regular cultural lynching Chinese people yielded the coinage of a phrase, "[[Chinaman's chance|Having a Chinaman's chance in Hell]]", meaning no chance at all.&lt;ref name="Infamous Lynchings"&gt;{{cite web | title = Infamous Lynchings |date= 20 October 2014| url = http://www.americanlynching.com/infamous-old.html | accessdate = 4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880 Denver, the Yellow Peril pogrom featured a lynched Chinese man and destruction of the local Chinatown.&lt;ref name="Infamous Lynchings"/&gt; In 1885, the [[Rock Springs massacre]] of 28 miners destroyed a Wyoming Chinese community.&lt;ref name="HarpWeek"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Anti-Chinese Hysteria of 1885–1886 | work =The Chinese-American Experience 1857–1892 | publisher = HarpWeek | url = http://immigrants.harpweek.com/ChineseAmericans/2KeyIssues/TheAntiChineseHysteria.htm| accessdate = 4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Washington Territory]], Yellow Peril fears realised the [[Attack on Squak Valley Chinese laborers, 1885]]; the arson of the Seattle Chinatown; and the [[Tacoma riot of 1885]] by which local white folk expelled the Chinese community from their towns.&lt;ref name="HarpWeek"/&gt; In Seattle, the [[Knights of Labor]] expelled 200 Chinese people by the [[Seattle riot of 1886]]. In Oregon, 34 Chinese gold miners were ambushed, robbed and killed in the [[Hells Canyon Massacre]] (1887). Moreover, about being Chinese in the 19th-century US, in the essay "A Chinese View of the Statue of Liberty" (1885), Sauum Song Bo said,:

{{quote|Seeing that the heading is an appeal to American citizens, to their love of country and liberty, I feel my countrymen, and myself, are honored in being thus appealed to, as citizens in the cause of liberty. But the word liberty makes me think of the fact that this country is a land of liberty for men of all nations, except the Chinese. I consider it an insult to us Chinese to call on us to contribute towards building, in this land, a pedestal for a statue of liberty. That statue represents Liberty holding a torch, which lights the passage of those of all nations who come into this country. But are Chinese allowed to come? As for the Chinese who are here, are they allowed to enjoy liberty as men of all other nationalities enjoy it? Are they allowed to go about everywhere free from insults, abuse, assaults, wrongs and injuries from which men of other nationalities are free?&lt;ref&gt;Bo, Sauum Song. "A Chinese View of the Statue of Liberty", pp. 232–233, ''Yellow Peril!: An Archive of anti–Asian Fear'', edited by John Kuo Wei Tchen, John Kuo and Dylan Yeats, London:Verso, 2014. p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====20th century====
[[File:Asiatic Barred Zone.png|right|thumb|300px|To contain the Yellow Peril, the Immigration Act of 1917 established the Asiatic Barred Zone from which the US admitted no immigrants.]]

Under [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] political pressure, the [[Immigration Act of 1917]] established an Asian Barred Zone of countries from which immigration to the US was forbidden. The [[Cable Act of 1922]], or the Married Women's Independent Nationality Act, guaranteed citizenship to independent woman unless they married to an alien ineligible to naturalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1998/summer/women-and-naturalization-1.html |title=Prologue: Selected Articles |publisher=Archives.gov |date= |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, when the Cable Act of 1922 was law, Asian men and women were excluded from American citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.si.edu/Curriculum%20Guide-Final/teacherhistory.htm |title=For Teacher—An Introduction to Asian American History |publisher=Apa.si.edu |date=19 February 1942|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/asian_voices/asian_timeline.cfm |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422015759/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/asian_voices/asian_timeline.cfm |archive-date=22 April 2009 |title=Timeline of Asian American History |website=Digital History}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the Cable Act of 1922 reversed some racial exclusion laws and granted independent-woman citizenship exclusively to women married to white men. Analogously, the Act allowed revocation of the US citizenship of a white woman married an Asian man. Nonetheless, legalized Yellow Peril racism was challenged; in the Supreme Court case of ''[[Takao Ozawa v. United States]]'' (1922), a Japanese–American man tried to demonstrate that the Japanese are a white race eligible for naturalized US citizenship, but the Court ruled that the Japanese are not white people. Two years later, the [[National Origins Quota of 1924]] specifically excluded the Japanese from the country and citizenship.

[[File:Yellow peril rupert.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The religious racialism of ''The Yellow Peril'' (1911, 3rd end.), by [[G. G. Rupert]], proposed that Russia would unite the Oriental races to conquer Christian civilisation in the Western world.]]

====Ethnic national character====
To "preserve the ideal of American homogeneity", the [[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921 (numeric limits) and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] (fewer Southern and Eastern Europeans) restricted admission according to immigrants' national origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/immigration-act | work=U.S Department of State Office of the Historian | title=The Immigration Act of 1924 (The Johnson-Reed Act) | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the Emergency Quota Act used an old census to determine the number of colored immigrants to admit to the US. Still, to protect the ethnic supremacy (social, economic and political) of the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] (WASP) community,{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} the Immigration Act of 1924 used the census of 1890 (two decades old) because{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} its 19th-century demographic-group percentages favoured more admissions of WASP immigrants and fewer admissions of colored immigrants from Asia, Eastern Europe and Southern Europe.

The [[National Origins Formula]] (1921–1965) was meant to maintain the ''status quo'' percentages of colored [[ethnicity|ethnic]] populations in proportion to their existing populations. The National Origins Formula was to ensure that the immigration of colored peoples did not change the WASP national character of the US. To that end, the National Origins Formula allowed only 150,000 colored people to immigrate the US per year. Specifically inclining Latin Americans and excluding Asians, the law used Yellow Peril racism, which was institutionally inherent to [[US immigration law]]. It was much later that the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] that repealed the racial quota systems.

====Eugenic apocalypse====
[[Eugenics]]-supporters used the Yellow Peril to present the US as a WASP nation with an ethnically-pure country under threat of [[miscegenation]] by Asian immigration. They expressed with biological language (infection, disease, decay) and imagery of bodily penetration (wounds and sores) by the nonwhite Asian Other.&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2014"&gt;Shimakawa, Karen. "National Abjection" pp. 236–41, ''Yellow Peril! An Archive of anti-Asian Fear'', John Kuo Wei Tchen and Dylan Yeats, Eds. London: Verso, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|237–238}}

In ''The Yellow Peril; or, Orient vs. Occident'' (1911), the [[end time]] evangelist [[G. G. Rupert]], said that Russia would unite the colored races to facilitate the Oriental invasion, conquest and subjugation of the West. That was derived from the Christian [[eschatology]] of the [[Book of Revelation]] in verse 16:12: "Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great Euphrates River, and it dried up so that the kings from the east could march their armies toward the west without hindrance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%2016:12-16:12&amp;version=50|title=Revelation 16:12 (New King James Version)|publisher=BibleGateway.com|accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as an Old-Testament Christian, Rupert believed in the racialist doctrine of [[British Israelism]] and said that the Yellow Peril from China, India, Japan and Korea, were attacking Britain and the US but that Jesus would halt their conquest of the Western world.&lt;ref name="NYU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boas.wordpress.com/2006/08/19/nyus-archivist-of-the-yellow-peril-exhibit/|title=NYU's 'Archivist of the Yellow Peril' Exhibit|publisher=Boas Blog|date=19 August 2006|accessdate=5 November 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013201844/http://boas.wordpress.com/2006/08/19/nyus-archivist-of-the-yellow-peril-exhibit/|archivedate=13 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy]]'' (1920), the eugenicist [[Lothrop Stoddard]], said that either China or Japan would unite the colored peoples of Asia and lead them to destroy the white world of the West and that the colored conquest of the world began with the Asian victory in the Russian–Japanese War (1905). As a [[white supremacist]], Stoddard presented his racialist theories with biblical vocabulary and catastrophic imagery depicting a rising tide of "non-white" people who mean to invade, conquer and subjugate the white race.&lt;ref&gt;Stoddard, Lothrop. "The Rising Tide of Color" pp. 216–17, ''Yellow Peril! An Archive of anti-Asian Fear'', John Kuo Wei Tchen &amp; Dylan Yeats, Eds. London:Verso, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political opposition====
In that cultural vein, the phrase was commonly used editorially in the newspapers of publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746032,00.html | work=Time | title=Foreign News: Again, Yellow Peril | date=11 September 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, Hearst newspapers realised a campaign of vilification (political and personal) against the American communist activist Elaine Black, whom he denounced as libertine "Tiger Woman" for openly cohabiting with [[Karl Yoneda]], an Asian man and a communist.&lt;ref name="Estrada, William David page 166"&gt;Estrada, William David. ''The Los Angeles Plaza: Sacred and Contested Space'' Austin: University of Texas Press, 2008 p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 California, interracial marriage was outlawed and so they could not marry, but in 1935, Black and Yoneda married in [[Seattle, Washington]], a city and a state that did not proscribe interracial marriage.&lt;ref name="Estrada, William David page 166"/&gt; The vilification of Elaine Black was about miscegenation, not communist politics. Publisher Hearst's business acumen saw that reporting the socially-scandalous private life of a politically-active American white woman in an interracial relationship with an Asian man would sell more newspapers.

====Socially-acceptable Asian====
In the 1930s, Yellow Peril stereotypes were common to US culture, exemplified by the cinematic versions of the Asian detectives [[Charlie Chan]] (Warner Oland) and [[Mr. Moto]] (Peter Lorre), originally literary detectives in novels and comic strips. White actors portrayed the Asian men and made the fictional characters socially acceptable in mainstream American cinema, especially when the villains were secret agents of Imperial Japan.&lt;ref name="Dower 1993"&gt;Dower, John. ''War Without Mercy: Race &amp; Power in the Pacific War'', New York: Pantheon 1993&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|159}}

Notable American proponents of the Japanese Yellow Peril were the military-industrial interests of the [[China Lobby]] (right-wing intellectuals, businessmen, Christian missionaries) who were political advocates for the [[warlord]] ''Generalíssimo'' [[Chiang Kai-shek]], whom they represented as the (Methodist-convert) Christian-Chinese saviour of China, then in the middle of civil war. After the Japanese invaded China in 1937, the China Lobby successfully pressured the politically neutral US government to aid the China of Chiang Kai-shek. The media coverage (print, radio and cinema) of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–45) favoured China, which politically facilitated the American financing and equipping of the anticommunist [[Kuomintang]], the Chiang Kai-shek faction in the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927–1937, 1946–1950), which also featured the Communist [[Mao Zedong]].&lt;ref name="Dower 1993"/&gt;{{rp|159}}

====Pragmatic racialism====
In 1941, after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the Roosevelt administration formally declared China an ally of the US. In political compliance with the government, the American media then modified the use of Yellow Peril ideology and criticised contemporary anti-Chinese laws as counterproductive to the war effort against Imperial Japan.&lt;ref name="Dower 1993"/&gt;{{rp|165–166}} The wartime ''zeitgeist'' and the geopolitics of the US government presumed that defeat of the [[Japanese Empire]] would be followed by post-war China developing into a major capitalist economy, under the [[strongman (politics)|strongman]] leadership of the Christian ''Generalíssimo'' [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party).

However, in the course of his political and personal relations with the US government, and his China Lobby sponsors, Chiang requested the repeal of American anti-Chinese laws and to achieve the repeals, threatened to exclude the American business community from the "China Market", the economic fantasy that the China Lobby promised to the military and industrial interests of the US.&lt;ref name="Dower 1993"/&gt;{{rp|171–172}} In 1943, the US government repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, but because the National Origins Act of 1924 was contemporary law, the repeal was a symbolic gesture of American solidarity with the people of China.

Science fiction writer [[William F. Wu]], said that American adventure, crime, and detective [[pulp magazine]]s in the 1930s had many Yellow Peril characters, loosely based on [[Fu Manchu]], and that although "most [Yellow Peril characters] were of Chinese descent", the Asian geopolitics of the time led people to see Japan as a threat to the United States. In his book ''The Yellow Peril: Chinese Americans in American fiction, 1850–1940'' (1982), Wu said that fear of Asians dates from the European [[Middle Ages]] during the 13th-century [[Mongol invasion of Europe]]. Most Europeans had never seen an Asian man or woman, and the great differences in language, custom and physique accounted for European paranoia about the nonwhite peoples from the Eastern world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lisa |last=Katayama |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5043319/the-yellow-peril-fu-manchu-and-the-ethnic-future |title=The Yellow Peril, Fu Manchu, and the Ethnic Future |website=Io9.com |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In the late 19th century, Australians desiring a proper country and a white society, feared the Yellow Peril for possession of the continent. The racialist fear of the non-white Asian Other was a thematic preoccupation common to [[invasion literature]] novels like ''The Yellow Wave: A Romance of the Asiatic Invasion of Australia'' (1895), ''The Coloured Conquest'' (1904), ''The Awakening to China'' (1909), ''Fools' Harvest'' (1939). They usually featured an Asian invasion of the "empty north" of Australia, which was really populated by the [[Aboriginal Australians]], the native non-white Other.&lt;ref name="Affeldt"&gt;{{cite web|last = Affeldt|first = Stefanie|title = 'White Sugar' against 'Yellow Peril' Consuming for National Identify and Racial Purity|publisher = University of Oxford|date = 12 July 2011|url = https://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/sozialoekonomie/hund/text_files/Affeldt_WSAYP.pdf|accessdate = 4 January 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140515052716/http://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/sozialoekonomie/hund/text_files/Affeldt_WSAYP.pdf|archivedate = 15 May 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel ''White or Yellow?: A Story of the Race War of A.D. 1908'' (1887), [[William Lane]], a journalist and labour leader, believed that a horde of Chinese people legally arrived to Australia overran white society and monopolized the industries important to exploiting the natural resources of the "empty north" of Australia.&lt;ref name="Affeldt"/&gt;

[[File:1910 White Australia badge.png|thumb|300px|In 1910, fear of the Yellow Peril prompted the nativist [[Australian Natives' Association]] to create the White Australia badge with which wearers could identify their racial loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://museumvictoria.com.au/learning-federation/white-australia/medal---australia-for-australians/ Museum Victoria description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105150237/http://museumvictoria.com.au/learning-federation/white-australia/medal---australia-for-australians/ |date=5 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Oceania UN Geoscheme - Map of Melanesia.svg|thumb|right|300px|The Yellow Peril was used to justify the [[White Australia Policy]], which excluded brown-skinned peoples of Melanesia from immigration to Australia.]]

====White nation====
As Australian invasion literature, ''White or Yellow?'' reflects Lane's nationalist racialism and left-wing politics in a [[future history]] of Australia under attack by the Yellow Peril. In the near future, British capitalists manipulate the legal system and successfully arrange the mass immigration of Chinese workers to Australia, regardless of the socioeconomic consequences to Australian common folk and their society. The economic, cultural, and sexual conflicts that resulted from the capitalists' manipulation of the economy provoke a white-yellow race war throughout Australia. The racialist representations of Yellow Peril ideology in the narrative of ''White or Yellow?'' justify white Australians' killing the Chinese workers as an existential response for physical and economic control of Australia.&lt;ref name="Auerbach 2009"/&gt;{{rp|26–27}} Moreover, the leaders of the labour and trade unions greatly opposed the importation of Chinese workers, whom they portrayed as an economic (low-wage) threat to Australia, and as a moral threat ([[libertinism]]) to Christian civilization, which addresses the psychosexual theme of [[miscegenation]] (mixing of the races), which is an apolitical call to racial unity among white Australians.&lt;ref name="Auerbach 2009"&gt;Auerbach, Sascha. ''Race, Law, and "The Chinese Puzzle" in Imperial Britain'', London: Macmillan, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}

Culturally, Asian-invasion novels expressed the white man's sexual fear of voracious Asian sexuality with scenes of a white woman in sexual peril, usually rape or seduction, aided by the sensual and moral release of [[opium]].&lt;ref name="Affeldt"/&gt; A white woman who was raped or seduced by a Chinese man had suffered "a fate worse than death". Thus defiled, the woman is a sexual untouchable to other white men.&lt;ref name="Affeldt"/&gt; In that moralistic vein, in the 1890s, labour activist and feminist [[Rose Summerfield]] voiced the white female sexual fear of the Yellow Peril by warning society of the unnatural lust in the eyes of Chinese men when they looked upon the pulchritude of the white women of Australia.&lt;ref name="Auerbach 2009"/&gt;{{rp|24}}

====Racial equality thwarted====
In 1901, the [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] adopted the [[White Australia policy|White Australia]] policies, initiated with the [[Immigration Restriction Act 1901]], which generally excluded Asian peoples, especially the Chinese and the [[Melanesians]]. Historian C.E.W. Bean said that Australian racialist exclusion was "a vehement effort to maintain a high, Western standard of economy, society, and culture (necessitating, at that stage, however it might be camouflaged, the rigid exclusion of Oriental peoples)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Bean|Bean, C. E. W.]] (2014) ''ANZAC to Amiens''; Penguin Books, p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the film, ''[[Australia Calls (1913 film)|Australia Calls]]'' (1913) depicted an invasion of Australia by "Mongolians" defeated by ordinary Australians with resistance and guerrilla warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Barber | first = Lynden| title = Unsettling Echoes of Yesterday, when the Yellow Peril Hysteria Began| work = The Australian|date= 11 September 2010| url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/unsettling-echoes-of-yesterday-when-the-yellow-peril-hysteria-began/story-e6frg6zo-1225917045565?nk=c5f898f2fc7c7e9cdd182c065d8ac0b1| accessdate = 4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] (28 June 1919), supported by Britain and the US, the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]], [[Billy Hughes]], vehemently opposed Imperial Japan's recommendation for the inclusion of the [[Racial Equality Proposal]] in Article 21 of the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] on 13 February 1919:

{{Quotation|The equality of nations being a basic principle of the League of Nations, the High Contracting Parties agree to accord, as soon as possible, to all alien nationals of states, members of the League, equal and just treatment in every respect, making no distinction, either in law or in fact, on account of their race or nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gordon Lauren | first1 = Paul | year = 1978 | title = Human Rights in History: Diplomacy and Racial Equality at the Paris Peace Conference | journal = Diplomatic History | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 257–278 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.1978.tb00435.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aware that Britain opposed the formal inclusion of the clause to Article 21 of the Covenant, the conference chairman, US President [[Woodrow Wilson]], prevented ''de jure'' racial equality among the nations of the world by unilaterally requiring a unanimous vote by the participant countries. On 11 April 1919, most countries in the conference voted to include a universal clause for racial equality Article 21 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, opposed only by Britain and the US. Moreover, to maintain the [[White Australian policy]], the Australian government sided with Britain in the vote against Japan's clause for racial equality, a defeat in international relations that greatly influenced Imperial Japan to turn from co-operation to confrontation with the West.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Paris 1919'' p. 321&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
====Colonial empire====
In 1890s France, the ''Péril jaune'' (Yellow Peril) was invoked in negative comparisons of the low French birth rate of the French and the high Asian birth rate.&lt;ref name="Cook Anderson page 25"&gt;Cook Anderson, Margaret. ''Regeneration Through Empire: French Pronatalists and Colonial Settlement in the Third Republic'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2014 p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, there was the cultural fear that one day Asians would "flood" France, which could be successfully countered only by increased fecundity of French women. Then, France would possess enough soldiers to thwart the eventual flood of immigrants from Asia.&lt;ref name="Cook Anderson page 25"/&gt; From that racialist perspective, the French press sided with Imperial Russia during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–1905) and represented the Russians as heroically defending the white race against the Japanese Yellow Peril.&lt;ref name="Beillevaire, Patrick X. (2000) pp. 185–232"&gt;Beillevaire, P. X. "L'opinion publique française face à la guerre russo–japonaise" in ''Cipango, cahiers d'études japonaises'', Volume 9, Autumn 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;185–232.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indochine française (1913).jpg|thumb|right|300px|The country and people of Vietnam once were part French Indochina in the Asian sector of the French colonial empire (1913).]]

In 1904, the French journalist [[René Pinon]] reported the cultural, geopolitical and existential threat to white civilisation in the West:
{{quote|The "Yellow Peril" has entered already into the imagination of the people, just as represented in the famous drawing [''Peoples of Europe, Guard Your Most Sacred Possessions'',1895] of the Emperor Wilhelm II: In a setting of conflagration and carnage, Japanese and Chinese hordes spread out over all Europe, crushing under their feet the ruins of our capital cities and destroying our civilizations, grown anemic due to the enjoyment of luxuries, and corrupted by the vanity of spirit.

Hence, little by little, there emerges the idea that even if a day must come (and that day does not seem near) the European peoples will cease to be their own enemies and even economic rivals, there will be a struggle ahead to face and there will rise a new peril, the yellow man.

The civilized world has always organized itself before and against a common adversary: for the Roman world, it was the barbarian; for the Christian world, it was Islam; for the world of tomorrow, it may well be the yellow man. And so we have the reappearance of this necessary concept, without which peoples do not know themselves, just as the "Me" only takes conscience of itself in opposition to the "[[Other (philosophy)|non–Me]]": The Enemy.&lt;ref name="TchenKuoDylan 2014"/&gt;{{rp|124}}}}

Despite the Christian idealism of the [[civilizing mission]], from the start of colonialisation in 1858, the French exploited the land of Vietnam as inexhaustible and the Vietnamese people as beasts of burden.&lt;ref name="Beigbeder 2006"&gt;Beigbeder, Yves. ''Judging War Crimes and Torture French Justice and International Criminal Tribunals and Commissions (1940–2005)'', Brill: Martinus Nijhoff, 2006, {{ISBN|9789004153295}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67–68}} During the [[First Indochina War]], (1946–1954) the French justified their colonial return of Vietnam as defense of the white West against the ''péril jaune'' – specifically the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]], as puppets of [[People's Republic of China|Red China]] in the communist conspiracy to conquer the world.&lt;ref&gt;Shafer, Michael. ''Deadly Paradigms: The Failure of U.S. Counterinsurgency Policy Princeton'' Princeton University Press, 2014 p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, French orientalism defined the Asian Other as less than human, combined with anticommunism, which [[objectification|dehumanisation]] allowed atrocities against [[Viet Minh]] prisoners of war, during ''la sale guerre'', the dirty war against international communism.&lt;ref name="Beigbeder 2006"/&gt;{{rp|74}} The Yellow Peril metaphors in French anti-communist media portrayed the Viet Minh as part of the ''innombrables masses jaunes'' (innumerable yellow hordes) and one of many ''vagues hurlantes'' (roaring waves) of ''masses fanatisées'' (fanatical hordes).&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Nicola.

Oxford: Berghahn 2000 p.&amp;nbsp;132.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Today====
In ''Behind the Bamboo Hedge: The Impact of Homeland Politics in the Parisian Vietnamese Community'' (1991),  Gisèle Luce Bousquet, said that the ''péril jaune'', which traditionally colours French perceptions of Asians, especially of the Vietnamese, remains a cultural prejudice of contemporary France.&lt;ref name="Bousquet, Gisèle Luce. p. 75."&gt;Bousquet, Gisèle Luce ''Behind the Bamboo Hedge: The Impact of Homeland Politics in the Parisian Vietnamese Community'', Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1991 p.&amp;nbsp;75&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the [[Vietnamese people in France]] are perceived and resented as academic overachievers who take jobs from "native French" people.&lt;ref name="Bousquet, Gisèle Luce. p. 75."/&gt;

In 2015, the front cover of the January issue of ''[[Fluide Glacial]]'' magazine featured a cartoon, ''Yellow Peril: Is it Already Too Late?'', which depicts a Chinese-occupied Paris where a sad Frenchman pulling a rickshaw, with a Chinese passenger (dressed as a 19th c. French colonial official) accompanied by a barely-dressed, blonde French woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Long| first = Simon| authorlink =| title = Dodging Peril| work = The Economist |date= 22 January 2015 | url = https://www.economist.com/news/china/21640402-instead-uniting-china-and-west-jihadist-violence-risks-further-dividing-them-dodging-peril| accessdate =1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="France 24"&gt;{{cite web| title = French comic's 'Yellow Peril' cover upsets Chinese paper| work = France 24|date= 20 January 2015 | url = http://www.france24.com/en/20150120-china-french-comic-book-yellow-peril-fluide-glacial-global-times-charlie-hebdo/| accessdate =1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor of ''Fluide Glacial'', Yan Lindingre defended the cover and the subject as satire and mockery of French fears of China's economic threat to France.&lt;ref name="France 24"/&gt; In an editorial directed to the complaining Chinese, Lindingre said, "I have just ordered an extra billion copies printed, and will send them to you via a chartered flight. This will help us balance our trade deficit and give you a good laugh".&lt;ref name="France 24"/&gt;

===Italy===
In the 20th century, from their perspective, as non-white nations in a world order dominated by the white nations, the geopolitics of [[Ethiopia–Japan relations]] allowed [[Imperial Japan]] and [[Ethiopia]] to avoid European imperial [[colonialism|colonisation]] of their countries and nations. Before the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] (1934–1936), Imperial Japan had given diplomatic and military support to Ethiopia against invasion by the [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]], which implied military assistance. In response to that Asian anti-imperialism, [[Benito Mussolini]] ordered a Yellow Peril propaganda campaign by the Italian press, which represented Imperial Japan as the military, cultural, and existential threat to the Western world, by way of the dangerous "yellow race–black race" alliance meant to unite Asians and Africans against the white people of the world.&lt;ref name="Clarke, Joseph Calvitt page 70"&gt;Clarke, Joseph Calvitt ''Alliance of the Colored Peoples: Ethiopia and Japan Before World War II'', Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;70&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Mussolini warned of the Japanese Yellow Peril, specifically the racial threat of Asia and Africa uniting against Europe.&lt;ref name="Clarke, Joseph Calvitt page 70"/&gt; In the summer of 1935, the [[National Fascist Party]] (1922–43) often staged anti–Japanese political protests throughout Italy.&lt;ref name="RansdellBardshaw"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ransdell | first = Jim | last2 = Bardshaw | first2 = Richard | title = Japan, Britain and the Yellow Peril in Africa in the 1930s | journal = The Asia-Pacific Journal | volume = 9  | number = 2  | date= 31 October 2011|url = http://japanfocus.org/-Jim-Ransdell/3626| accessdate =1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, as right-wing imperial powers, Japan and Italy pragmatically agreed to disagree; in exchange for Italian diplomatic recognition of [[Manchukuo]] (1932–45), the Japanese puppet state in China, Imperial Japan would not aid Ethiopia against Italian invasion and so Italy would end the anti–Japanese Yellow Peril propaganda in the national press of Italy.&lt;ref name="RansdellBardshaw"/&gt;

===Mexico===
During the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–20), [[Chinese-Mexicans]] were subjected to racist abuse, like before the revolt, for not being Christians, specifically [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Roman Catholic]], for not being racially [[Mexicans|Mexican]], and for not soldiering and fighting in the [[Mexican Revolution|Revolution]] against the thirty-five-year dictatorship (1876–1911) of General [[Porfirio Diaz|Porfirio Díaz]].&lt;ref name="Knight 1987"&gt;Knight, Alan.

In revolutionary Mexico (1910–20), Yellow Peril ideology led to the massacre (11–15 May 1911) of 308 Asian people (303 Chinese, 5 Japanese) in the city of Torreón, Coahuila, in northern Mexico.}}]]

The notable atrocity against the Yellow Peril was the three-day [[Torreón massacre]] (13–15 May 1911) in northern Mexico, wherein the military forces of [[Francisco I. Madero]] killed 308 Asian people (303 Chinese, 5 Japanese), because they were deemed a cultural threat to the Mexican way of life. The massacre of Chinese- and [[Japanese Mexicans|Japanese-Mexicans]] at the city of Torreón, [[Coahulia State]], was not the only such atrocity perpetrated in the Revolution. Elsewhere, in 1913, after the [[Constitutional Army]] captured the city of [[Tamasopo]], San Luis Potosí state, the soldiers and the town-folk expelled the Yellow Peril from town by sacking and burning the Chinatown.&lt;ref name="Knight 1987"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

During and after the Mexican Revolution, the Roman Catholic prejudices of Yellow Peril ideology facilitated racial discrimination and violence against Chinese Mexicans, usually for "stealing jobs" from native Mexicans, etc. Anti–Chinese, nativist propaganda misrepresented the Chinese people as unhygienic, prone to immorality (miscegenation, gambling, opium-smoking) and spreading diseases that would biologically corrupt and degenerate ''[[La Raza]]'' (the Mexican race) and generally undermining the Mexican patriarchy.&lt;ref name="jcurtis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Curtis |first1=James R. |date=July 1995 |title= Mexicali's Chinatown |journal=[[Geographical Review]] |location=New York |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=335–349 |doi=10.2307/215277 |jstor=215277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, from the racialist perspective, besides stealing work from Mexican men, Chinese men were stealing Mexican women from the native Mexican men who were away fighting the Revolution, overthrowing and expelling the dictator [[Porfirio Díaz]] and his foreign sponsors from Mexico.&lt;ref name="camacho552553"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Schiavone Camacho |first1= Julia María |date=November 2009 |title=Crossing Boundaries, Claiming a Homeland: The Mexican Chinese Transpacific Journey to Becoming Mexican, 1930s–1960s |journal= Pacific Historical Review |location=Berkeley |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=545–577 |doi=10.1525/phr.2009.78.4.545 |jstor=10.1525/phr.2009.78.4.545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, approximately 70% of the Chinese and the Chinese–Mexican population was expelled from the Mexican United States by the bureaucratic ethnic culling of the Mexican population.&lt;ref name="thesis108"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campos Rico |first1=Ivonne Virginia |title= La Formación de la Comunidad China en México: políticas, migración, antichinismo y relaciones socioculturales (thesis)  |year=2003 |publisher=Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH-SEP) |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Empire===
In 1908, after the [[Young Turk Revolution]], the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP) achieved political dominance, reinforced, five years later, after the [[Raid on the Sublime Porte]] in 1913. The CuP greatly admired the Japanese for modernising their country while retaining its "Eastern spiritual essence", and it proclaimed its intention to transform the [[Ottoman Empire]] into the "Japan of the Near East".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Worringer |first=Renée |title='Sick Man of Europe' or 'Japan of the near East'?: Constructing Ottoman Modernity in the Hamidian and Young Turk Eras |pages=207–230 |journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies |volume=36 |issue=2 |date=May 2004 |jstor=3880032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an inversion of the Yellow Peril racism of the Western world, the Young Turks thought of entering an alliance with Imperial Japan that would unite all the peoples of "the East" to wage a war of extermination against the much-hated Western nations whose empires dominated the world.&lt;ref name="Worringer 2014"&gt;Worringer, Renee. (2014) ''Ottomans Imagining Japan: East, Middle East, and Non–Western Modernity at the Turn of the Twentieth Century'', London: Palgrave.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54–55}} Culturally, for the Young Turks, the term "yellow" symbolised the "Eastern gold" colour that represents the innate moral superiority of the Eastern world over the corrupt, materialistic West.&lt;ref name="Worringer 2014"/&gt;{{rp|53–54}}

===South Africa===
[[File:Punch 1903 - Chinese Paul.jpg|right|thumb|The Randlord's (mine owners') exploitive employment of Chinese labour contributed to the Liberal Party victory in the 1906 elections. (Punch magazine, 1903)]]

From 1904 to 1910, the [[Unionist government, 1895–1905|Unionist Government]] of the Britain authorised the immigration to [[History of South Africa (1815–1910)|South Africa]] of approximately 63,000 Chinese labourers to work the gold mines in the [[Witwatersrand basin]] after the conclusion of the [[Second Boer War]]. After 1910, most Chinese miners were repatriated to China because of the great opposition to them, as "coloured people", in the white society of South Africa, much like the anti–Chinese laws in the US during the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinajournal/2008/06/19/in-south-africa-chinese-is-the-new-black/ | work=Wall Street Journal | title=In South Africa, Chinese is the New Black | date=19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Park2009"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/rei-v1.3b.pdf | work=Representation, Expression and Identity | year=2009 | publisher=Interdisciplinary Perspectives | title=Recent Chinese Migrations to South Africa – New Intersections of Race, Class and Ethnicity | first=Yoon Jung | last=Park | ISBN=978-1-904710-81-3 | accessdate=20 September 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228041728/http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/rei-v1.3b.pdf | archivedate=28 December 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mass immigration of [[indentured servant|indentured]] Chinese labourers to mine South African gold for wages lower than acceptable to the native white men, contributed to the electoral loss of the financially-conservative British Unionist government that then governed South Africa.&lt;ref name="Yap1996"&gt;{{cite book |title=Colour, Confusion and Concessions: The History of the Chinese in South Africa |last1=Yap |first1=Melanie |last2=Leong Man |first2=Dainne |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |location=Hong Kong |isbn=962-209-423-6 |page=510 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|103}}

On 26 March 1904, approximately 80,000 people attended the social-protest demonstration against the use of Chinese labourers in the Transvaal was held in [[Hyde Park, London]], to publicise the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of [[Chinese South Africans]].&lt;ref name="Yap1996"/&gt;{{rp|107}} The Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress then passed a resolution declaring:

{{quote|That this meeting, consisting of all classes of citizens of London, emphatically protests against the action of the Government in granting permission to import into South Africa indentured Chinese labour under conditions of slavery, and calls upon them to protect this new colony from the greed of capitalists and the Empire from degradation.&lt;ref name="Demo"&gt;{{cite book |title=Chinese Mine Labour in the Transvaal |last1=Official Programme of the Great Demonstration in Hyde Park |first1=[S.l.:s.n.] |last2=Richardson |first2= |authorlink= |year=1904 |publisher=Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress |location=London |isbn= |pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the event, despite the racial violence between white South African miners and Chinese miners, the Unionist government achieved the economic recovery of South Africa after the [[Second Boer War|Anglo–Boer War]] by making the gold mines of the Witwatersrand Basin the most productive in the world.&lt;ref name="Yap1996"/&gt;{{rp|103}}

===Turkey===
In recent years, there have been very strong anti-Chinese feelings in Turkey owing to allegations of human rights abuses against the Muslim [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Uyghurs|Uighur people]] in China's [[Xinjiang]] province.&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{cite news | title = Bashing and wooing China Anti-Chinese protests in Turkey | work = The Economist|date= 11 July 2015 | url = https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21657419-pious-sinophobia-wont-deflect-turkeys-strategic-dreams-bashing-and-wooing-china | accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one anti-Chinese demonstration in [[Istanbul]], a South Korean tourist was threatened with violence even she protested that "I am not Chinese, I am Korean".&lt;ref name="The Economist"/&gt; In response, [[Devlet Bahçeli]], leader of the extreme right-wing [[Nationalist Movement Party]] stated: "How does one distinguish between Chinese and Koreans? Both have slanted eyes".&lt;ref name="The Economist"/&gt;

===New Zealand===
In the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, populist Prime Minister [[Richard Seddon]] compared the Chinese people to monkeys, and so used the Yellow Peril to promote [[Racialism|racialist]] politics in New Zealand. In 1879, in his first political speech, Seddon said that New Zealand did not wish her shores "deluged with Asiatic [[Tatars|Tartars]]. I would sooner address white men than these Chinese. You can't talk to them, you can't reason with them. All you can get from them is 'No savvy'".&lt;ref&gt;Burdon, Randal Mathews. ''King Dick: A Biography of Richard John Seddon'', Whitcombe &amp; Tombs, 1955, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in 1905, in the city of Wellington, the fanatical [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] [[Lionel Terry]] murdered Joe Kum Yung, an old Chinese man, in protest against Asian immigration to New Zealand. Laws promulgated to limit Chinese immigration included a heavy [[Poll tax (New Zealand)|poll tax]], introduced in 1881 and lowered in 1937, after [[Imperial Japan]]'s [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invasion and occupation]] of China. In 1944, the poll tax was abolished, and the [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand government]] formally apologised to the Chinese populace of New Zealand.

==Sexual fears==
===Background===
The core of Yellow Peril ideology is the white man's fear of Oriental sexual voracity; of the Seducer and the Seductress ([[Dragon Lady]] and [[Lotus Blossom]]) who possess an unnatural and perverse sex appeal that is a moral and a mortal threat to the white civilisation of the Christian West.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Racist revulsion towards [[miscegenation]] – interracial sexual intercourse – communicated with sexual stereotypes of the Yellow Peril, derives from the fear of mixed-race children, whose existence threatens Whiteness proper.&lt;ref name="Dower 1993"/&gt;{{rp|159}}

===The seducer===
The seductive Asian man (wealthy and cultured) was the more common form of white-male fear of the Asian sexual Other. In the Asian seducer, the sexual threat of the Yellow Peril was realised with successful sexual competition – seduction or rape – which irredeemably corrupted the white woman, beyond redemption.  (see: ''[[55 Days at Peking]]'', 1963)&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The American critic Gary Hoppenstand identified interracial sexual-intercourse as a threat to the culture of whiteness:

{{quote|The threat of rape, the rape of white society dominated the yellow formula. The British or American hero, during the course of his battle against the yellow peril, overcomes numerous traps and obstacles in order to save his civilization, and the primary symbol of that civilization: white women. Stories featuring the Yellow Peril were arguments for white purity. Certainly, the potential union of the Oriental and white implied at best, a form of beastly sodomy, and at worse, a Satanic marriage. The Yellow Peril stereotype easily became incorporated into Christian mythology, and the Oriental assumed the role of the devil or demon. The Oriental rape of white woman signified a spiritual damnation for the women, and at the larger level, white society.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|3}}}}

[[File:The Cheat 1915.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Edith Hardy (Fannie Ward) and Hishuru Tori (Sessue Hayakawa) in ''The Cheat'' (1915)]]

In ''[[The Cheat (1915 film)|The Cheat]]'' (1915), the wealthy Hishuru Tori (Sessue Hayakawa) is a Japanese sexual predator and sadist whose attentions menace Edith Hardy ([[Fannie Ward]]), an American housewife.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|19–23}} Although superficially [[Westernization|Westernized]], Tori is a rapist, which reflects his true cultural identity as an Asian man.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}} In being "brutal and cultivated, wealthy and base, cultured and barbaric, Tori embodies the contradictory qualities Americans associate with Japan".&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|19}} Initially, the story presents Tori as an "asexual" man associating with the high society of [[Long Island]]; yet, once Edith is in his private study, decorated with Japanese art, he is a man of "brooding, implicitly sadistic sexuality".&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|21}} At times, before Tori attempts to rape Edith, the narrative of the story implies that she is attracted to him and corresponds his sexual interest in her. To assure commercial success, the cast of ''The Cheat'' (1915) featured the Japanese actor [[Sessue Hayakawa]] – who was a male sex symbol in the cinema of that time – which was a cultural fact that resonated on-screen and off-screen as a sexual threat to the existing racial hierarchy and sexual mores of white men in 1915.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|21–22 &amp; 25.}}



In ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' (1932), General Henry Chang ([[Warner Oland]]) is a warlord of [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] origin (Chinese and American), whom the narrative presents as an asexual man, which excludes him from the realm of Western sexual mores and the racialist order; thus, he is dangerous to the Westerners he holds hostage.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|64}} Though Chang is Eurasian, he is prouder of his Chinese heritage, and rejects his American heritage, which rejection confirms his Oriental identity.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|64}}

In 1931, the [[Chinese civil war]] has rendered the country into a version of Hell, which a diverse group of Westerners must traverse by train, from Beijing to [[Shanghai]], a voyage that turns for the worse when General Chang's soldiers hijack the train.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|61}} The story implies that Gen. Chang is a bisexual man who desires to rape the heroine, Shanghai Lily ([[Marlene Dietrich]]), and the hero, Captain Donald "Doc" Harvey ([[Clive Brook]]).&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|64}}

Moreover, when the German opium smuggler Erich Baum ([[Gustav von Seyffertitz]]) insults Chang, the warlord symbolically rapes him by branding; the sadistic Chang derives sexual pleasure in branding Baum with a red-hot poker.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|64–65}} After being branded, the once proud Baum becomes notably cowed and submissive to Chang, then owns him in realisation of the ultimate fear of the Yellow Peril: Westerners enslaved to the unnatural and perverse sexuality of the East; later, Chang rapes Hui Fei ([[Anna May Wong]]).&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|65}}

Gen. Chang's desire to blind Capt. Harvey also is a castration metaphor, a taboo subject even for the intellectually permissive [[Production code]] in effect in 1932.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|65}} In marked contrast to Chang's bisexuality and his "almost effeminate polish", the British Army Captain Harvey is a resolutely heterosexual man, a tough, rugged soldier tested and proved in the trenches of the First World War (1914–18); the Briton is a model of Western masculinity and strength.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|64–65}} Throughout, the narrative implies that Shanghai Lily and Hui Fei are in a lesbian relationship, thus, at story's end, Lily's choice of Capt. Harvey as her lover, reaffirms the heterosexual appeal of the Western man and redeems her from prostitution.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|60–65}}

The narrative of ''Shanghai Express'' embraces the stereotypes of the Yellow Peril through the Eurasian character of Gen. Chang, and also undermines their inhumanity through the suffering of Hui Fei, who cries inconsolably after Chang raped her, such humanity allows the audience to sympathize with a non-white [[Other (philosophy)|Other]].&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|65}} As a courtesan, Hui Fei is condescended to by every Western character, except her best friend Lily, because of her race and profession, but is shown as dignified woman who stands up for herself.&lt;ref name="Chan 2003"&gt;Chan, Anthony, ''Perpetually Cool: The Many Lives of Anna May Wong'' Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|232–234}} At the climax, Hui Fei kills Gen. Chang to save Harvey from being blinded by him; she explains that killing Chang regained the self-respect he had taken from her. Throughout, the narrative has suggested that Shanghai Lily and Hui Fei are more attracted to each other than to Capt. Harvey. That detail of character, which suggests that Hui Fei is sexually abnormal, was socially daring drama in 1932, because Western mores considered bi-sexuality to be unnatural.&lt;ref name="Chan 2003"/&gt;{{rp|232,236}} The same criticism of sexual orientation might apply to Lily, but the story concludes with resumed heterosexuality, when she kisses Capt. Harvey, while Hui Fei walks away alone, sad for having been raped and for losing her best friend to Capt. Harvey.&lt;ref name="Chan 2003"/&gt;{{rp|232,236–237}}

===The seductress===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Terryandpirates92736.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Dragon Lady stereotype of the Yellow Peril was introduced in the comic strip ''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'' (27 September 1936), by Milton Caniff.]] --&gt;
The [[Dragon Lady]] is a cultural [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of white fear of Asian female sexuality. The Asian seductress is a charming, beautiful, and sexually insatiable woman who readily and easily dominates men. As a sexual [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], the dragon-lady woman is a tempting, but morally degrading object of desire for the white man.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

In Western cinema genre, the cowboy town features an Asian woman who usually portrayed as a scheming prostitute, always seeking to use her sexuality (charisma and physical sex-appeal) to beguile and dominate the white man.&lt;ref&gt;Dhingra, Pawan, Rodíiguez, Robyn Magalit. ''Asian America: Sociological and Interdisciplinary Perspectives'', London: Polity Press, 2014 p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt; In the American television program [[Ally McBeal]] (1997–2002), the Yellow Peril featured the Dragon Lady stereotype, personified as the [[Ling Woo]] character, a domineering woman whose Chinese ethnicity includes sexual abilities that no white woman could hope to match.&lt;ref&gt;Pham, Vincent. Ono, Kent. ''Asian Americans and the Media'', London: Polity, 2009 pp.&amp;nbsp;68–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, such a sexual representation of the Yellow Peril, introduced in the comic strip ''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'' (27 September 1936), indicates that the Western imagination continues to associate Asia, as a region of exotic beauty and material opulence, of moral laxity and sensual excess, and of cultural decadence. To the Westerner, the seductiveness of the Orient implies spiritual threat and hidden [[Identity (philosophy)|existential]] danger, derived from the desire to be enticed and hypnotized, to be entrapped and suffocated in a masochistic surrender of white identity, "to be engulfed by what Freudians might describe as a metaphoric womb–tomb".&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|67–68}}

===The Lotus Blossom===
A variant Yellow-Peril seductress is presented in the white-saviour romance between a "White Knight" from the West and a "Lotus Blossom" from the East; each redeems the other by way of mutual [[Romance (love)|romantic love]]. Despite being a threat to the passive sexuality of white women, the romantic narrative favourably portrays the Lotus Blossom character as a woman who needs the love of a white man to rescue her from [[objectification]] by a flawed Asian culture.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|108–111}} As a heroine, the Lotus-Blossom-woman is an ultra-feminine model of Asian pulchritude, social grace, and culture, whose own people trapped her in an inferior, gender-determined social-class. Only a white man can rescue her from such a cultural impasse, thereby, the narrative reaffirms the [[Cultural imperialism|moral superiority]] of the Western world.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|108–111}}

;Hong Kong
In ''[[The World of Suzie Wong (film)|The World of Suzie Wong]]'' (1960), the eponymous anti-heroine is a lost-soul prostitute saved by the love of Robert Lomax ([[William Holden]]), an American painter living in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|123}} The East–West sexual differences available to Lomax are two: an unpleasant, career-minded British girlfriend, Kay O'Neill ([[Sylvia Syms]]), who is mannishly independent; and Suzie Wong, who is a conventionally feminine and submissive woman. She works as a sexual prostitute because of her poverty in Hong Kong, which, the story suggests, is the natural condition of the peoples of Asia.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|113–116}}
[[File:Nancy Kwan in The World of Suzie Wong (1960).jpg|thumb|right|300px|In Hong Kong, the prostitute Suzie Wong (Nancy Kwan), plies her trade with a sailor, in ''The World of Suzie Wong'' (1960).]]

Moreover, in 1959, the economic ascendancy of Hong Kong, as part of the "Asian Tiger Economy", had just begun to improve life for the Chinese. Nonetheless, despite the film's historical inaccuracy of background, the cultural contrast of the [[Representation (arts)|representations]] of Suzie Wong and Kay O'Neill imply that if a Western woman wants to win a cultured, Western man (like the painter Robert Lomax) she should emulate the sexually passive prostitute (Suzie Wong) rather than the independent and "controlling" career-woman (Kay O'Neill).&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|116}} As an [[Orientalism (book)|Oriental stereotype]], the submissive Asian girl (Lotus -Blossom Wong) shows her innate masochism when she "proudly displays signs of a beating, to her fellow hookers, and uses it as evidence that her man loves her", which condition further increases Lomax's need to rescue her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Butler | first = Craig| authorlink =  | title = Review of The World of Suzie Wong| website = Allmovie|date= 22 January 2015 | url = http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-world-of-suzie-wong-v55504/review| accessdate =5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologically, the painter Lomax needs the prostitute Wong, as the muse whose eroticism inspires the self-discipline necessary for becoming an accomplished painter.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|120}} Suzie Wong is an illiterate orphan who was sexually abused as a girl; thus her toleration of abuse by most of her Chinese clients.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|113}} That Lomax is portrayed as more enlightened and caring, than Chinese and British men, implies the moral superiority of the American culture over the decadent society of Hong Kong and over the decayed British Empire; the Americans shall be better geopolitical and [[Cultural hegemony|cultural]] custodians of Asia than were the British.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"&gt;{{cite book|title=Romance and the "Yellow Peril": Race, Sex, and Discursive Strategies in Hollywood Fiction|first=Gina|last=Marchetti|publisher=University of California Press|ISBN=9780520914629|year=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CF0pQHLD-6gC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|115}} When a British sailor attempts to rape Wong, the chivalrous Lomax rescues her and beats the would-be rapist; all the while, Chinese men sat by, indifferent to the rape of a prostitute.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|115}}

As a Lotus Blossom stereotype of the Yellow Peril, the prostitute Suzie Wong is a single mother, of a child, by a Chinese man who abandoned them; the socially dramatic backstory of the woman emphasises the casual cruelty of Hong Kong's Asian society.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|117}} In contrast to the casual brutality (emotional and physical) with which Chinese and British characters treat Wong, the sensitive artist Lomax loves her as a "child–woman", and saves her with a new social identity as his Lotus Blossom, an ideal woman who is docile under his paternalism.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|120–123}} Yet Lomax's love is conditional; throughout the story, she wears a Chinese [[Cheongsam]] dress, but when she dresses in Western clothes, Lomax rips off her dress, and orders her to only wear a cheongsam – Suzie Wong is acceptable only as an Asian girl created in conformity to the Western cultural mores of proper womanhood and femininity.&lt;ref name="Marchetti 1994"/&gt;{{rp|121}}

;Vietnam
In the opera ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' (1989), the country of [[Vietnam]] is represented as a beautifully exotic and mysterious place of sensuous beauty, incomprehensible savagery, and much filth.&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"&gt;Shimakawa, Karen. ''National Abjection'', Durham: Duke University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}} The opening chorus of the first song, "The Heat's on Saigon", begins thus: "The heat's on Saigon / The girls are hotter 'n hell / Tonight one of these slits will be Miss Saigon / God, the tension is high / Not to mention the smell".&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|34}}

The first act, set in Saigon City, presents the adolescent prostitute-heroine named Kim, who is portrayed as a demure "Lotus Blossom" who is a sexually available and submissive Asian woman whose life is defined by her love for a white man, the [[United States Marine Corps|American Marine]] Chris Scott.&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|28–32}} That every Vietnamese woman is a prostitute, and that all, but one, are Dragon Ladies who easily display their bodies in bikini swim suits, confirms the Western stereotype of the hyper-sexual Asian woman.&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|31–32}} The second act, set in [[Thailand]], portrays Thai women as prostitutes, and reinforces the Western stereotype of the hyper-sexual Asian woman who is perpetually available to copulate. At the Dreamland brothel, Kim is the only woman who does not always dress in a bikini swimsuit.&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Her passivity, moral purity, and fidelity to the Marine Chris, who abandoned her and their son in South Vietnam, returned to the U.S. and married the American woman Ellen, suggests that subservience is the proper relation between an Asian woman and a white man.&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

Despite working as a prostitute, the seventeen-year-old Kim is a virginal innocent who needs the Marine Chris to protect her from the cruel world of Saigon City.&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|32}} One of the songs that Chris sings about her suggests that Kim is Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|31}} In contrast to the aggressive Vietnamese male characters, the passive Kim is portrayed as being the true Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|31–33}} Moreover, the man Thuy, a [[Viet Cong]] guerrilla who wants to marry Kim, is portrayed as a jealous and possessive, violent and cruel man who seeks to exploit her, the opposite of Chris, who only seeks to love her.&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|34}} The character of the pimp, Tran Van Dinh, aka "The Engineer", is a Eurasian man whose sexuality is "simply incomprehensible, illegible, indeterminate, even as it is spectacularly displayed".&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|41}}

East Asia studies Professor Karen Shimakawa described the Engineer as "simultaneously lascivious, sexually exploitative, pan-sexual ''and'' desexualized."&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|41}} Although the character was born of a French father and a Vietnamese mother, the libretto always emphasises his Oriental-ness.&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|39}} "The Engineer embodies an un-categorizable, yet spectacular perversity – a condition that, the logic of the play suggests, is hereditary: It is the direct result of his racially and nationally mixed beginnings in prostitution and sexual debauchery".&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|41}} The best friend of Chris, is a black man named John, an enthusiastic patron of the Dreamland brothel, fulfils the racial stereotype of the sexually voracious black man.&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|30}} Unlike the romantic Chris, John is given to crude, macho boasting about his sexual prowess, and only sees the women of the Dreamland brothel as sexual objects.&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|30–32}} In contrast to the flawed masculinity of the coloured men, the white Chris is a kind, gentle man who genuinely loves Kim, and sings: "I wanted to save her, protect her / Christ, I'm an American / How could I fail to do good?".&lt;ref name="Shimakawa 2002"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

===Oriental sexual voracity===
The essence of the Western fear of the Yellow Peril is that Asian men and women are sexually voracious people, whose Oriental cultures emphasise the sensual and sensuous aspects of life. As such, Oriental sexuality threatens the moral destruction of the Christian West, by way of enslavement to the senses. Prof. Tim Thompson said that a "perfect example" of such sexual fear of the Asian Other is the Canadian short story "The Fall: With a Whimper" (2007), by Tantric Legion, in the genre of graphic-pornography horror-story.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2009"&gt;Thompson, Tim "'The Incomprehensible Body': Representations of Asian Femininity in Modern Western Literature" pp.&amp;nbsp;2007–2024 in ''Papers for the Conference Western Images of East Asia Exploring the Critical Issues 14 April 2009'', Waterloo: University of Waterloo, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2014}}

Intelligent, [[hermaphrodite]] worms arrive to China from outer space; they are "sexual parasites" approximately one-foot in length and three-inches in diameter.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2009"/&gt; In the scenes of infectious rape, the phallic worms penetrate the human body through vaginas and anuses, and then assume control of the victim's mind. The protagonist, Mei, a pretty, young schoolteacher in [[Jiuquan]]. In the first half of the story, the frightened Mei continually attempts to avoid infection, to no avail. After being infected, she sets out to infect the rest of humanity. As the self-named "Mei host", she considers herself a "good slave" who longs only to do the bidding of her "masters", her affectionate name for the worms that control her mind and body. Their "one, fervent wish" is to create a "glorious, new civilization" that will bless humanity with a "shared consciousness". Moreover, the worms also transform the bodies of the victims, and Mei host, now endowed with "swollen breasts and a constant state of sexual arousal", has no trouble seducing people, whom she infects with the phallic worms.

The authorial voice of the narrative presents Mei's transformation, from demure-"Stoneman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Stoneman | first = Rod | title = Far East Fu fighting: The Yellow Peril – Dr Fu Manchu and the Rise of Chinophobia| work =The Irish Times| date= 8 November 2014| url = http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/far-east-fu-fighting-the-yellow-peril-dr-fu-manchu-and-the-rise-of-chinophobia-1.1988872| accessdate = 4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images of flooding and bodily penetration evoke Yellow-Peril racism, and the classic, white xenophobia of the Chinese as a faceless horde overwhelming the rest of humanity, specifically, the white peoples of Western Europe and North America. Because the phallic worms are hermaphrodite, the infected Chinese are a literal foreign body infecting the men and women who are the world polity. Thematically, "The Fall: With a Whimper" evokes the white Christian fear of ambiguous sexual orientation; Western sexual anxieties psychologically projected onto the Asian [[Other (philosophy)|Other]].

==Fiction==

===Fu Manchu and criminal kin===

The Yellow Peril was a common subject for colonial adventure fiction, of which the representative villain is [[Fu manchu|Dr. Fu Manchu]], created by [[Sax Rohmer]], and featured in thirteen novels (1913–59). Fu Manchu is an evil Chinese gangster and mad scientist who means to conquer the world, despite continually being foiled by the British policeman and gentleman spy Sir [[Denis Nayland Smith]], and his assistant Dr. Petrie.

Fu Manchu was patterned on the antagonist of the Yellow Peril series and novel ''The Yellow Danger; Or, what Might Happen in the Division of the Chinese Empire Should Estrange all European Countries'' (1898), by [[M. P. Shiel]], published initially as the serial story ''The Empress of the Earth: The Tale of the Yellow War''; and published in the U.S. first as ''China in Arms'' (1898), and then revised as ''The Yellow Danger: The Story of the World's Greatest War'' (1899)&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;

Retrieved 22 October 2015. Entry by 'EFB/JC', or [[Everett F. Bleiler]] and [[John Clute]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the context of the Fu Manchu series, and Shiel's influence, reviewer Jack Adrian described Sax Rohmer as a 

{{quote|''shameless inflater of a peril that was no peril at all … into an absurd global conspiracy.
''He had not even the excuse … of his predecessor in this shabby lie, M.P. Shiel, who was a vigorous racist, sometimes exhibiting a hatred and horror of Jews and Far Eastern races. Rohmer's own racism was careless and casual, a mere symptom of the times.''&lt;ref&gt;Adrian, Jack. "Rohmer, Sax" pp. 482–84, ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers'', David Pringle, Ed. Detroit: St. James Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dr. Fu Manchu is the head of the Si-Fan, an international criminal organisation and a pan-Asian murder gang recruited from the "darkest places of the East" with countless Chinese, Burmese, Malay, and Indian thugs willing to perform any command.&lt;ref name="Seshagiri pages 211-216"&gt;Seshagiri, Urmila "Modernity's (Yellow) Perils" pp. 211–16, ''Yellow Peril!: An Archive of anti-Asian Fear'',  John Kuo Wei Tchen &amp; Dylan Yeats, Eds. London: Verso, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The novels feature the recurring scene wherein Fu Manchu despatches assassins (usually Chinese or Indian) to kill Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie. In the course of adventure, they are surrounded by coloured foreigners wishing to harm them; the metaphor is that the East has trespassed into the West.&lt;ref name="Seshagiri pages 211-216"/&gt;

===Cinema of the Yellow Peril===
[[File:Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe (1940) 1.jpg|thumb|right|350px|In ''Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe'' (1940), Ming the Merciless (Charles Middleton, actor) is the Yellow Peril of the future. The woman is his daughter, Princess Aura.]]
In the 1930s, Hollywood offered two contradictory images of Asian men: (i) The malevolent master-criminal, Dr. [[Fu Manchu]]; and (ii) The benevolent master-detective, [[Charlie Chan]].&lt;ref name="Huang Yunte page 144"/&gt; As a Yellow Peril villain, Fu Manchu is "Rohmer's concoction of cunning Asian villainy [that] connects with the irrational fears of proliferation and incursion: Racist myths often carried by the water imagery of flood, deluge, the tidal waves of immigrants, rivers of blood."&lt;ref name="Stoneman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Stoneman | first = Rod | title = Far East Fu fighting: The Yellow Peril – Dr Fu Manchu and the Rise of Chinophobia| work =The Irish Times| date= 8 November 2014| url = http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/far-east-fu-fighting-the-yellow-peril-dr-fu-manchu-and-the-rise-of-chinophobia-1.1988872| accessdate = 4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, when the Nazis banned his novels in Germany, because they believed him Jewish, Sax Rohmer denied being racist and published a letter declaring himself "a good Irishman", wherein he was disingenuous about the why of the Nazi book-ban, because "my stories are not inimical to Nazi ideals."&lt;ref name="Stoneman"/&gt;

''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]'' (1932) reflects the white man's sexual-anxiety as the basis of Yellow Peril fear; thus Fu Manchu ([[Boris Karloff]]) urges his Asian army to "Kill the white man and take his women!"&lt;ref&gt;Frayling, Christopher. "Fu Manchu", in ''The BFI Companion to Horror''. London, Cassell,1996, pp. 131–32 . {{ISBN|0-304-33216-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incest, between father and daughter, is a recurrent theme in the narrative of ''The Mask of Fu Manchu'', especially the ambiguous nature of the relationship between Fu Manchu and his daughter, Fah Lo See ([[Myrna Loy]]), an example of the unnatural sexuality of the yellow race.&lt;ref name="Huang Yunte page 144"&gt;Yunte, Huang. ''Charlie Chan: The Untold Story of the Honorable Detective and His Rendezvous with American History'', New York: W.W. Norton, 2010. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor [[Ming the Merciless]], nemesis of [[Flash Gordon]], was another iteration of the Fu Manchu trope. Peter Feng calls him a "futuristic Yellow Peril", quoting a reviewer who referred to Ming as a "slanty eyed, shiny domed, pointy nailed, arching eyebrowed, exotically dressed Oriental".&lt;ref&gt;Peter X. Feng, ''Screening Asian Americans'', Rutgers University Press, 2002, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Buck Rogers]] fought against the Mongol Reds (aka the Hans), who had conquered the U.S. in the 25th century. In the late 1950s, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]] (Marvel Comics) published the [[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]], a pastiche of the Fu Manchu stories. In the 1970s, Marvel Comics used Fu Manchu as the principal foe of his son, [[Shang-Chi]], Master of Kung Fu.

===Literary Yellow Peril===
The villain [[Li Shoon]], created by [[H. Irving Hancock]], appeared in "Under the Ban of Li Shoon" and "Li Shoon's Deadliest Mission" in Detective Story Magazine in 1916. Yellow Peril [[racial stereotypes]] were common currency in the genre literature of [[pulp magazine]] fiction of the early 20th century. Physically, Li Shoon is a "tall and stout" man with "a round, moon-like yellow face" with "bulging eyebrows" above "sunken eyes". Personally, Li Shoon is "an amazing compound of evil" and intellect, which makes him "a wonder at everything wicked" and "a marvel of satanic cunning." In 1937, the publisher [[DC Comics]] featured "Ching Lung" on the cover and in the first issue of ''[[Detective Comics]]'' (March 1937).

''Yellow Peril: The Adventures of Sir John Weymouth–Smythe'', by Richard Jaccoma (1978) is a [[pastiche]] of the Fu Manchu novels by Sax Rohmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Jaccoma|title="Yellow Peril": The Adventures of Sir John Weymouth-Smythe: a Novel|publisher=Richard Marek Publishers|year=1978|isbn=0-399-90007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in the 1930s, the novel is a distillation of the [[psychosexual]] and racist stereotypes of the Dragon Lady seductress and of the ruthless [[Mongol]] who threaten Western civilisation. The story is told in the genre's traditional first-person narrative of Sir John Weymouth–Smythe, an anti-hero who is simultaneously a lecher and a prude, continually torn between sensual desire and Victorian sensibility. The plot concerns Weymouth–Smythe's quest for the Spear of Destiny, a relic with supernatural power, which gives the possessor control of the world. Throughout the story, Weymouth–Smythe spends much time battling the nominal villain, Chou en Shu, for possession of the Spear of Destiny. In the course of the action, thematic developments reveal that the Yellow Peril is not the villain, but the (Nazi) Germans who were ostensible allies of the British anti-hero, Weymouth–Smythe, in the quest for the Spear of Destiny. The Nazis are led by Clara Schicksal, a stereotypical Teutonic blonde woman who sacrifices Burmese boys to ancient German gods, whilst [[fellatio|fellating]] them; later, Weymouth–Symthe punishes Schicksal by sodomizing her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kenney| first = Joe | title = The Yellow Peril: The Adventures of John Weymout–Smythe, by Richard Jaccoma | date= 21 June 2013| url = http://glorioustrash.blogspot.ca/2013/06/yellow-peril.html| accessdate = 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '' The Yellow Danger; Or, what Might Happen in the Division of the Chinese Empire Should Estrange all European Countries'' (1898), by [[M. P. Shiel]], deals with the consequences of the murder of two German missionaries, in [[Jiaozhou Bay]] (Kiau-Tschou); the villain is Dr. Yen How. The novel originally was published as the serial story, ''The Empress of the Earth: The Tale of the Yellow War'' (5 Feb – 18 June 1897) in ''Short Stories'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{isfdb title|886690|The Empress of the Earth}}. Retrieved 22 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It centers on the murder of two German missionaries in [[Jiaozhou Bay|Kiau-Tschou]] in 1897 and features the Chinese villain, Dr&amp;nbsp;Yen How.
* "[[The Unparalleled Invasion]]" (1910), by Jack London, is presented as a narrative historical essay of the events occurred between 1976 and 1987, wherein China invades, conquers, and colonises neighbour countries; Chinese conquest of the Earth is their ultimate goal. In self-defence, the countries of the Western World attack China with [[biological warfare]], using [[smallpox]], [[yellow fever]], [[cholera]], and [[Black Death]]. The Chinese people who escape contaminated China are killed by the Western armies and navies at the land and sea borders; the few survivors of the plagues are killed with [[punitive expedition]]s to the interior of China proper. Philosophically, the Western [[genocide]] of the Chinese people is positively described in detail in a narrative featuring the racist color terms "yellow life" and "yellow populace" to justify "the sanitation of China" and its [[Settler colonialism|settler colonisation]] by white-skinned Westerners under "the democratic American programme."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/StrengthStrong/invasion.html|title=THE UNPARALLELED INVASION|publisher=The Jack London Online Collection|accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2018}}

* ''The Peril of the Pacific'' (1916), by J. Allan Dunn, describes a Japanese [[Mainland invasion of the United States|invasion]] of the western U.S. in 1920, positing a treasonous alliance between immigrant [[Japanese Americans|Japanese-Americans]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]]. The narrative language reflects contemporaneous racist anxiety over the social status of Japanese-Americans, most of whom lived in California, and who were exempt from anti-immigration legislation in accordance with the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907]]. The thematic implication of ''The Peril of the Pacific'' is that the primary loyalty of Japanese-Americans is to [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, J.&amp;nbsp;Allan. ''The Peril of the Pacific'', Off-Trail Publications, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-935031-16-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2018}}

Lovecraft, the protagonist white-man is allowed to see the future of planet Earth, a world conquered by the "yellow men" who triumphantly dance to their drums among the ruins of the white man's world. In the short story "[[The Horror at Red Hook]]" (1927), features a land controlled by non-white people, where "slant-eyed immigrants practice nameless rites in honor of heathen gods by the light of the moon." The author, H. P. Lovecraft, was in continual fear that Asian peoples would conquer the world and replace the white man's supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Call of Cthulhu and other Weird Stories'', Penguin Classics, 1999 (p. 390), wherein the editor documents Lovecraft's fears that Japan and China will conquer the Western world.&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=March 2018}}

The '''Young Civilians''' ({{lang-tr|Genç Siviller}}) is a civil society / political organization and youth movement in Turkey.  It was founded by a small group in 2007, and the organization has since grown in size and has supporters all over the globe, due in part to their social media presence.  They are a diverse group by political ideology as well as by ethnicity, language, and religion.  They disapprove of discrimination of any kind.  They are firmly against the military getting involved in affairs of the state, and are pro-democracy.  They organize marches, rallies, and protests, often with heavy use of humor and satire.
