'''The 8 Learning Management Questions''' (or 8 LMQs) are a set of sequential design based questions for teachers that engage them to develop a teaching plan for their classrooms, so as to produce intended learning outcome in all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m08.cgpublisher.com/proposals/363/index_html|title=The Learning Management Design Process|website=m08.cgpublisher.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:221499|title=Understanding the links between learning and instructional design|first=Nichols,|last=Kim|date=1 January 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is focused on enabling teachers to translate teaching theory into practice.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, J.M. (2009). Valuing practice over theory: How beginning teachers re-orient their practice in the transition from the university to the workplace. Teaching and Teacher Education, Volume 25, Issue 5, July 2009, Pages 647–654&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environorth.org.au/environorth/teach/downloads/Learning-Design-Process.pdf |title=Designing Learning |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, DE 2012, Preparing teachers in times of change: teaching school, standards, new content and evidence, Primrose Hall Publishing Group, Brisbane, Qld. {{ISBN|9781471611025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The questions were developed by [http://scu.edu.au/staffdirectory/person_detail.php?person=16082 Professor David E. Lynch] in 1998. The 8 questions, which are organised into three design phases, are answered in their numerical sequence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131227050433/http://prijipati.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/4497/1/Vol6No2Article2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

OUTCOMES PHASE
LMQ1: What have my students achieved to date?
LMQ2: What do I am to achieve in my students
STRATEGY PHASE
LMQ3: How do my students best learn?
LMQ4: What resources do I have at my disposal?
LMQ5: What are my teaching strategies?
LMQ6: Who will do what to support the teaching strategy?
EVIDENCE PHASE
LMQ7: How will I check that students have achieved the defined learning outcomes?
LMQ8: How will I report student progress?&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, D &amp; Smith, R 2012, Assessing and reporting the classroom curriculum in the knowledge age, Primrose Hall Publishing Group, Tarragindi, Qld. {{ISBN|9781471649417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eplumb10a2.blogspot.com.au/2010/04/lynchs-eight-learning-management.html|title=Assessment 2 Emma Plumb: Lynch’s Eight Learning Management Questions|first=Emma|last=Plumb|date=17 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8 LMQs have two key purposes. Firstly, they act as a ‘professional knowledge organiser’. This means the 8 LMQs enable the teacher to identify and then organise the fundamental consideration, or elements, required for the successful development and execution of learning experiences, units of work or individual lessons. For the [[student-teacher]] the 8LMQs act as a ‘knowledge organiser’ whereby essential professional knowledge, learnt as part of their preparation program, is organised such they have a bank of ‘considerations’ that they can call upon as they engage with each question. By this is meant the teacher education program should be presented so as to inform each LMQ. This has the effect of providing the student-teacher with a ‘ready-reference’ arrangement of knowledge that they can draw upon and unpack when designing and then executing successful learning experiences.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lynch, D, &amp; Smith, R 2011, Designing the classroom curriculum in the knowledge age, AACLM Press, Brisbane, Qld&lt;/ref&gt;

The second purpose of the 8LMQs is to transition ‘teaching’ from ‘teacher centred activities’ to a more responsive ‘[[student-centred learning]]' approaches. The 8 LMQs are therefore a deliberate strategy to draw the [[teacher]] to the nuances of each student and away from ‘the one-size-fits all’ approaches that are characteristic of ‘teaching’ and ‘curriculum planning’ and [[lesson plan]]ning.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Cecily (2010) Resilience education and the learning management process. In: The Theory and Practice of Learning Management. Pearson Education Australia, Frenchs' Forest, NSW Australia, pp. 136-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8 LMQs are underpinned by the [[Learning Management|Dimensions of Learning]] (DoL) pedagogic framework. DoL provides a bank of [[evidence-based]] teaching strategies for developing and delivering specific learning experiences or [[lessons]]. By this is meant a series of ‘step-by-step’ teaching strategies that have been confirmed by research as underpinning successful learning experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Cecily, and Bauer, Kathy (2010) Early childhood education and the learning design process. In: Applied Learning Management: new approaches for the new millennium. Pearson Australia, Frenchs' Forest, NSW Australia, pp. 22-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The learning management concept is further explained at www.aaclm.com

The 8 Learning Management Questions underpin [[teacher training]] at Central Queensland University and Charles Darwin University in Australia and inform teaching in the Northern Territory.

'''Advanced Placement [[History of the United States|United States History]]''' (also known as '''AP U.S. History''' or '''APUSH''') is a course and examination offered by [[College Board]] as part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]].

==Curriculum==

The AP U.S. History course is designed to provide the same level of content and instruction that students would face in a freshman-level college survey class. AP U.S. History classes generally use a college-level textbook as the foundation for the course.

===Textbooks===
Commonly used textbooks that meet the curriculum requirements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/html/apcourseaudit/courses/us_history_textbook_list.html |title=AP United States History: Example Textbook List |publisher=CollegeBoard |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; include:

===Conservative criticism===
[[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] have criticized the curriculum for downplaying [[American exceptionalism]] and failing to foster patriotism. In 2014, [[2014 Jefferson County Public Schools protests|there were protests against it]] in the [[Jefferson County Public Schools (Colorado)|Jefferson County Public Schools district]] in Colorado. In 2015, a bill to replace the curriculum was passed by the [[Oklahoma House of Representatives]]’ Education Committee, but later withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/ap-us-history-controversy-becomes-a-debate-on-america-115381.html|title=AP U.S. History controversy becomes a debate on America -|last=Lerner|first=Adam B.|date=21 February 2015|work=[[Politico]]|publisher=Politico|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/02/23/oklahoma-legislature-targets-ap-us-history-framework-being-negative |title=Oklahoma Board of Education targets US History course for being "negative"|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exam==
The AP U.S. History exam lasts 3 hours and 15 minutes and consists of two sections; additionally, each section is divided into two parts.  Section I, part A includes 55 multiple choice questions with each question containing four choices. The multiple choice questions cover American History from [[Pre-Columbian era|just before European contact with Native Americans]] to the present day. Moreover, section I, part B includes three short-answer questions. The first two questions are required, but students choose between the third and fourth questions. In total, students are given 95 minutes (55 for the multiple choice section and 40 for three short-answer questions) to complete section I.

Section II of the exam is the free-response section, in which examinees write two [[Essay|essays]]. Section II, part A, is a [[document-based question]] (DBQ), which provides an essay prompt and seven short primary sources or excerpts related to the prompt. Students are expected to write an essay responding to the prompt in which they utilize the sources in addition to outside information. Section II, part B, provides three thematic essay prompts. Students must respond to only one of the three essay prompts. 

Each long essay essay question on the AP exam may address any one of three possible historical thinking skills: patterns of continuity and change over time, comparison, or causation. Both of the essay questions will address the same historical thinking skill. In addition, neither essay's time frame will be exclusively before 1607 (the founding of Jamestown) or after 1980 (President Reagan's election). There is a fifteen-minute reading period for students to read the essay prompts, take notes, and brainstorm; but students may begin to write the essays before this period ends. Students will then have 85 minutes to write the two essays; 45 minutes are recommended for the DBQ and 40 minutes for the long essay, but students are free to work on the two essays as they see fit.&lt;ref name="Exam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-us-history-course-and-exam-description.pdf |title=AP US History: Course and Exam Description |publisher=CollegeBoard |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the AP U.S. History Test was taken by 402,947 students worldwide,&lt;ref name="2011 Scores"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/2011_US_History_Score_Dist.pdf |title=AP United States History Student Score Distributions Global AP Exams - May 2011 |year=2011 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it second in terms of number of examinees, behind the AP English Language and Composition exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/exgrd_sum/2011.html|title=AP Data – Archived Data 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401102514/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/exgrd_sum/2011.html|archive-date=2013-04-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==
The AP U.S. History exam is divided into two sections. Section one consists of the multiple choice and short answer questions, while section two consists of the document-based question (DBQ) and a long essay question. Section one is worth 60% of the total AP exam score, with 40% of the total exam score derived from the student's performance on the multiple choice section and 20% of the total exam score derived from the student's performance on the short answer questions. The remaining 40% of the total exam score is derived from section two; the document-based question is worth 25% of the total exam score, while the long essay question is worth 15% of the total exam score.&lt;ref name="Exam"/&gt;

[[File:Anganwadi Worker AWW Distributing Dresses to childrens.jpg|alt=Anganwadi Worker AWW Distributing Dresses to childrens|thumb|AWW Distributing dresses to Childrens]]
'''Anganwadi''' is a type of rural child care centre in [[India]]. They were started by the Indian government in 1975 as part of the [[Integrated Child Development Services]] program to combat child hunger and malnutrition. ''Anganwadi'' means  "courtyard shelter" in Indian languages. 

A typical Anganwadi centre provides basic health care in [[India]]n villages. It is a part of the Indian public health care system. Basic health care activities include contraceptive counseling and supply, nutrition education and supplementation, as well as pre-school activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://populationcommission.nic.in/npp_app1.htm National Population Policy 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207010417/http://populationcommission.nic.in/npp_app1.htm |date=February 7, 2012 }}, National Commission on Population website. Accessed February 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The centres may be used as depots for [[oral rehydration salts]], basic medicines and contraceptives.
As many as 13.3 [[lakh]] (a lakh is 100,000) Anganwadi and mini-Anganwadi centres (AWCs/mini-AWCs) are operational out of 13.7 lakh sanctioned AWCs/mini-AWCs, as of 31 January 2013. These centres provide supplementary nutrition, non-formal pre-school education, nutrition and health education, immunization, health check-up and referral services of which later three services are provided in convergence with public health systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=92848 | title=Anganwadi Centres}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Worker responsibilities ==

The Ministry of Women and Child Development has laid down guidelines for the responsibilities of Anganwadi workers (AWW). These include showing community support and active participation in executing this programme, to conduct regular quick surveys of all families, organize pre-school activities, provide health and nutrition education to families especially pregnant women on how to breastfeed, etc., motivating families to adopt family planning, educating parents about child growth and development, assist in the implementation and execution of Kishori Shakti Yojana (KSY) to educate teenage girls and parents by organizing social awareness programmes etc., identify disabilities in children, and so on.

== Supervision ==

Every 40 to 65 Anganwadi workers are supervised by one Mukhya Sevika. They provide on-the-job training. In addition to performing the responsibilities with the Anganwadi workers, they have other duties such as keeping track of who are benefiting from the programme from low economic status — specifically those who belong to the malnourished category; guide the Anganwadi workers in assessing the age and weight of children and how to plot their weights; demonstrate effective methods, for example, in providing health and nutrition education to mothers; and maintain statistics of Anganwadis and the workers to determine what can be improved. The Mukhya Sevika then reports to the Child development Projects Officer (CDPO).&lt;ref name="healthopine2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthopine.com/healthcare-infrastructure/the-anganwadi-workers-of-india-connecting-for-health-at-the-grassroots|title=The Anganwadi Workers of India|date=3 March 2011|work=Health Opine|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Despite decades of impressive growth,  India has a acute shortage of doctors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=AMY KAZMIN |title=Doctors are scapegoats for India’s failing health system |url=https://www.ft.com/content/8053cef2-33d5-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e |accessdate=7 November 2018 |agency=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The doctor population ratio in 2013 was 1:1800, the recommended  level is 1:1000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deo |first1=Madhav |title=Doctor population ratio for India - the reality |journal=Indian Journal of Medical Research |volume=137 |issue=4 |pages=632–5 |pmid=23703329 |pmc=3724242 |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.   Through the Anganwadi system, the country is trying to meet its goal of enhanced health facilities that aren't affordable and accessible for local populations. 

In many ways an Anganwadi worker is better equipped than a physician in reaching out to the rural population. Since the worker lives with the people she is in a better position to identify the cause of health problems and hence counter them. She has a very good insight of the health status in her region. Secondly though Anganwadi workers are not as skilled or qualified as professionals they have better social skills thus making it easier to interact with the people.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Moreover, since these workers are from the village, they are trusted which makes it easier for them to help the people. Last but not the least, Anganwadi workers are well aware of the ways of the people, are comfortable with the language, know the rural folk personally etc. This makes it very easy for them to figure out the problems being faced by the people and ensure that they are solved.&lt;ref name="healthopine2001" /&gt;

==Challenges and solutions==

There have been public policy discussions over whether to make Anganwadis universally available to all eligible children and mothers who want their children there. This would require significant increases in budgetary allocation and a rise in Anganwadis centers to over 16 lakh.

Anganwadis are staffed by officers and their helpers, who are typically women from poor families. The workers do not have permanent jobs with comprehensive retirement benefits like other government staff. Worker protests (by the All India Anganwadi Workers Federation) and public debates on this topic are ongoing. There are periodic reports of corruption and crimes against women in some Anganwadi centers. There are legal and societal issues when Anganwadi-serviced children fall sick or die.

In announcing the 2008-2009 budget, Indian Finance Minister P Chidambaram stated that salaries would be increased for Anganwadi workers to ₹15000 per month and helpers to ₹6500 per month. In March 2008 there was debate about whether packaged foods (such as biscuits) should become part of the food served. Detractors, including Nobel Prize winner [[Amartya Sen]], disagreed saying it will become the only food consumed by the children. Options for increasing partnership with the private sector are continuing.

In a major initiative, the centre is set to digitise the work of Anganwadis starting with 27 most-backward districts in Uttar Pradesh: Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. Anganwadis will be provided with tablet computers to record data that will be integrated with the health ministry which is involved in carrying out immunisation, health check-ups, and nutrition education under the [[Integrated Child Development Services|Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS)]].

== Integration with other official schemes ==

The [[Integrated Child Development Services (India)]] Scheme did not have provision for construction of AWC buildings as this was envisaged to be provided by the community except for the North Eastern States. For them,  financial support was provided for construction of AWC buildings since 2001-02 at a unit cost of ₹175,000.

As part of the strengthening and restructuring the ICDS Scheme, the government approved a provision of construction of 200,000 Anganwadi centre buildings at a cost of ₹450,000 per unit during XII Plan period in a phased manner with cost sharing ratio of 75:25 between centre and states (other than the NER, where it will be at 90:10).

Further, construction of AWC has been notified as a permissible activity under [[Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act]] (MNREGA). The construction of AWC buildings can be taken up in convergence with MNREGA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anganwadi Centres|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=92848|publisher=Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

The Anganwadi is functioning as indicated by a collection of reports by the leading daily newspaper, ''The Times of India''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/keyword/anganwadi | title=News: India News, Latest Bollywood News, Sports News, Business &amp; Political News, National &amp; International News &amp;#124; Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; To quote from the first report,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Two children of an anganwadi centre in Angul district died in a freak accident on Friday. They drowned in a rainwater-filled pit dug near their anganwadi centre. The children are Priyanka Dash (3) and Monalisa Naik (4) of Tentulihata village within Banarapala police limits, 20 km from here. The incident comes two months after seven children of an anganwadi centre were killed in Nayagarh district when rain-soaked brick wall of the centre fell on them while they were having their mid-day meals."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a desperate attempt to improve the poor state of governance of the Anganvadi scheme in his budget speech for the financial year 2011-12, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee increased the salary for Anganwadi workers to ₹3000 per month and helpers to ₹1500 per month — about one tenth of the salary of government office assistant.

==International efforts==

UNICEF and the [[UN Millennium Development Goals]] of reducing infant mortality and improving maternal care are the impetus for increasing focus on the Anganwadis.

Workers and helpers are expected to be trained per [[WHO]] standards.

Last accessed May 4, 2009. |url=http://www.ypepth.gr/en_ec_page1531.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is graded on a 20-point scale.

== Greece ==

=== Changes over the years ===

Terminology: '''Apolytirio''', Απολυτήριο ([[Dhimotiki]]), 1976–present); '''Apolytirion''', Απολυτήριον ([[Katharevousa]] (up until 1976)).

The system and examinations accepted for entrance into highest ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ανὠτατη, ''anotati'') and higher ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ανώτερη, ''anoteri'')  education in Greece went through major changes since 1980.

==== 1984–1998 ====

The most common/known Lyceum is the '''General Lyceum''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Γενικὀ Λύκειο, ''Geniko Lykeio'').

In the first 2 grades, all students are taught the same subjects. In 3rd grade, students followed a core programme of
general education and each ''Desmi'' (Α, Β, Γ, and  Δ) followed a specialized program ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Δέσμη, Δέσμες / ''Desmi'' (singular), ''Desmes'' (plural)).&lt;ref name="web.uni-marburg.de"&gt;[http://web.uni-marburg.de/eurostudies/studienreform/eaie_cd/ACE_CoE_CD_2005/acebook/NARIC_guide.pdf NARIC guide on Higher Education Systems in the European Union,Edition of 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209072945/http://web.uni-marburg.de/eurostudies/studienreform/eaie_cd/ACE_CoE_CD_2005/acebook/NARIC_guide.pdf |date=2008-12-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Apolytirio of ''Geniko Lykeio'' included the [[Academic grading in Greece|GPA]] (scale 1–20), student's [[Behavior|conduct]] information and consisted of:

From 1984 until 1998 ''only'' the ''total score'' of the ''Panhellenic Examinations'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Πανελλήνιες / Πανελλαδικές Εξετάσεις) was accepted for the highest/higher education, [[List of universities in Greece|Universities]] and [[Polytechnic (Greece)|Polytechnics]] (''Highest Education'') or the [[List of universities in Greece|Technological Educational Institutes (T.E.I.)]] (''Higher Education''; by law Π.Δ. 2916/2001 in 2001 were considered to be at the same rank as Universities.

The total Score was calculated from the individual scores, with one of the subjects having a higher weight percentage.
e.g. for A Desmi: Mathematics, B Desmi: Biology, etc.

The 4 ''Desmes'' (A,B,Γ and Δ) were:&lt;ref name="tm.pasok.gr"&gt;{{cite web|title=ΣΥΣΤΗΜΑΤΑ ΕΙΣΑΓΩΓΗΣ ΣΤΗΝ ΤΡΙΤΟΒΑΘΜΙΑ ΕΚΠΑΙΔΕΥΣΗ ΤΗΣ ΕΛΛΑΔΑΣ 1964-2006 |url=http://tm.pasok.gr/paideia/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/systhmata.doc |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112061849/http://tm.pasok.gr/paideia/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/systhmata.doc |archivedate=2011-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students had to preselect their choices in a numerical order of preference—using the bases of last year's Panhellenic Examinations' only as a guide—and submit them to their school on a given deadline, using a 4-pages machine-readable document ([[Greek language|Greek]]: μηχανογραφικό δελτίο, ''michanografiko deltio'').
The results of the National Examinations determined not only who will pass into highest/higher education but also next year's bases.

The total individual score for every subject was 0–160&lt;ref name="web.uni-marburg.de" /&gt;  which was the sum of the 2 examiners' scores based on the scale 0–80 each. A remarking by a 3rd examiner would determine the final score if there was a large difference between the first two scores.

'''Maximum total score = ((160 x 1.15)+ (160 x 0.95) + (160 x 0.95) + (160 x 0.95)) x 10 = 6400 units'''

*Units: ([[Greek language|Greek]]: μόρια, ''moria'' (plural)), same numeric format with the bases.

First, the scores for every student and later the bases for each course were published in every school across the country, directly from the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs. Bases were also being broadcast on Greek TV during the day.

It was allowed to keep the individual subjects' scores (up to 3) and resit on exams to increase the total score, but only for 2 more examinations.&lt;ref name="tm.pasok.gr" /&gt;

==== 1999–2004 ====

There are three grades in ''Eniaio Lykeio'' and each grade is divided in classes.

The 1st grade of ''Eniaio Lykeio'' operates as an orientation year with a general knowledge programme.

The 2nd grade includes three directions: Humanities (Θεωρητική Κατεύθυνση), Science (Θετική Κατεύθυνση) and Technology (Τεχνολογική Κατεύθυνση).

In the 3rd grade we have again the three directions but the Technology direction operates in two courses: i) the Technology and the Production course and ii) the Information Science and Services course.

In ''Eniaio Lykeio'', there is the Support Teaching Programme. This programme can be attended by those pupils who wish to do so, regardless of their performance.

Attendance in Eniaio Lykeio is obligatory for those students who wish to continue their education in a Greek University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etwinning.net/shared/data/etwinning/country_focus/greece_education_system_en.pdf BASIC ORGANIZATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN GREECE].&lt;/ref&gt;

The access to tertiary education (highest education) is permitted only with the system of ''Eniaio Lykeio''. Right of entrance have only the holders of the ''Apolytirio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Υπουργείο Εθνικής Παιδείας και Θρησκευμάτων - Νεο Σύστημα Εξετάσεων Ενιαίου Λυκείου:. Last accessed May 4, 2009. |url=http://www.ypepth.gr/el_ec_page910.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The written examinations in the subjects, either at school's level or at national level, count equivalently towards the Apolytirio's GPA.&lt;ref name="ypepth.gr"&gt;[http://www.ypepth.gr/docs/bibl_geniko_1_39_tel08.pdf ΥΠΟΥΡΓΕΙΟ ΕΘΝΙΚΗΣ ΠΑΙΔΕΙΑΣ ΚΑΙ ΘΡΗΣΚΕΥΜΑΤΩΝ.

General Education: 2 subjects
(1: Modern Greek (compulsory) and 1: History/Mathematics and Statistics' elements/Biology/Physics)

==== Now ====

There are 3 directions (Human Sciences, Economy and Computer Sciences, Natural Sciences).

The Panhellenic national level exams involve 4 or 5 main subjects with which you compete in one or two scientific fields.

== Acceptance abroad ==

The Apolytirio may be accepted in UK and other universities.

Individuals holding this qualification can check the comparability of this award with UK [[NARIC]]; the National Agency, managed to provide (on behalf of the UK Government) the only official source of information on international qualifications to organizations recruiting from overseas and to individuals wishing to work or study in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK NARIC - Home. Last accessed May 4, 2009. |url=http://www.naric.org.uk/index.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt; if they are going to study or work in the UK.

Although the total score from Panhellenic Examinations determined the entrance in higher/highest education in Greece, the GPA of the Apolytirio, is the entry qualification most often requested in order to be accepted in higher education abroad.
The results of the Panhellenic Examinations are usually not requested or are referred by different names such as ''General Entrance Examinations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The University of Western Ontario - Welcome to Western.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23577">'''Automated essay scoring''' ('''AES''') is the use of specialized computer programs to assign grades to essays written in an educational setting. It is a method of [[educational assessment]] and an application of [[natural language processing]]. Its objective is to classify a large set of textual entities into a small number of discrete categories, corresponding to the possible grades&amp;mdash;for example, the numbers 1 to 6. Therefore, it can be considered a problem of [[statistical classification]].

Several factors have contributed to a growing interest in AES. Among them are cost, accountability, standards, and technology. Rising education costs have led to pressure to hold the educational system accountable for results by imposing standards. The advance of information technology promises to measure educational achievement at reduced cost.

The use of AES for [[high-stakes testing]] in education has generated significant backlash, with opponents pointing to research that computers cannot yet grade writing accurately and arguing that their use for such purposes promotes teaching writing in reductive ways (i.e. [[teaching to the test]]).

By 1990, desktop computers had become so powerful and so widespread that AES was a practical possibility. As early as 1982, a UNIX program called Writer's Workbench was able to offer punctuation, spelling, and grammar advice.&lt;ref name="MacDonald_1982"&gt;MacDonald, N.H., L.T. Frase, P.S.

[[Peter Foltz]] and [[Thomas Landauer]] developed a system using a scoring engine called the Intelligent Essay Assessor™  (IEA).  IEA was first used to score essays in 1997 for their undergraduate courses.&lt;ref name="Rudner"&gt;Rudner, Lawrence.

ETS's Criterion&lt;sup&gt;SM&lt;/sup&gt; Online Writing Evaluation Service uses the e-rater engine to provide both scores and targeted feedback.

Lawrence Rudner has done some work with Bayesian scoring, and developed a system called BETSY (Bayesian Essay Test Scoring sYstem).&lt;ref name="Rudner_2002"&gt;Rudner, Lawrence (ca. 2002).

Retrieved 2012-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his results have been published in print or online, but no commercial system incorporates BETSY as yet.

Under the leadership of Howard Mitzel and Sue Lottridge, Pacific Metrics developed a constructed response automated scoring engine, CRASE®.  Currently utilized by several state departments of education and in a U.S. Department of Education-funded Enhanced Assessment Grant, Pacific Metrics’ technology has been used in large-scale formative and summative assessment environments since 2007.

Frederiksen Chair in Assessment Innovation at the [[Educational Testing Service]].&lt;ref name=Bennett_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=Randy E.|title=The Changing Nature of Educational Assessment|journal=Review of Research in Education|date=March 2015|volume=39|issue=1|pages=370–407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the major criticisms of the study have been that five of the eight datasets consisted of paragraphs rather than essays, four of the eight data sets were graded by human readers for content only rather than for writing ability, and that rather than measuring human readers and the AES machines against the "true score", the average of the two readers' scores, the study employed an artificial construct, the "resolved score", which in four datasets consisted of the higher of the two human scores if there was a disagreement.  This last practice, in particular, gave the machines an unfair advantage by allowing them to round up for these datasets.&lt;ref name=Perelman_2013 /&gt;

==Procedure==
From the beginning, the basic procedure for AES has been to start with a training set of essays that have been carefully hand-scored.&lt;ref name="Keith_2003b"&gt;Keith, Timothy Z. (2003), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The program evaluates surface features of the text of each essay, such as the total number of words, the number of subordinate clauses, or the ratio of uppercase to lowercase letters&amp;mdash;quantities that can be measured without any human insight. It then constructs a mathematical model that relates these quantities to the scores that the essays received. The same model is then applied to calculate scores of new essays.

Recently, one such mathematical model was created by Isaac Persing and Vincent Ng.&lt;ref&gt;Persing, Isaac, and Vincent Ng (2015). [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P15/P15-1053.pdf "Modeling Argument Strength in Student Essays"], pp. 543-552. In ''Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers)''. Retrieved 2015-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt; which not only evaluates essays on the above features, but also on their argument strength. It evaluates various features of the essay, such as the agreement level of the author and reasons for the same, adherence to the prompt's topic, locations of argument components (major claim, claim, premise), errors in the arguments, cohesion in the arguments among various other features. In contrast to the other models mentioned above, this model is closer in duplicating human insight while grading essays.

The various AES programs differ in what specific surface features they measure, how many essays are required in the training set, and most significantly in the mathematical modeling technique. Early attempts used [[linear regression]]. Modern systems may use linear regression  or other machine learning techniques often in combination with other statistical techniques such as [[latent semantic analysis]]&lt;ref name="Bennett_2005b"&gt;Bennett, Randy Elliot, and Anat Ben-Simon (2005), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bayesian inference]].&lt;ref name="Rudner_2002" /&gt;

==Criteria for success==
Any method of assessment must be judged on validity, fairness, and reliability.&lt;ref name="Chung_2003"&gt;Chung, Gregory K.W.K., and Eva L. Baker (2003). "Issues in the Reliability and Validity of Automated Scoring of Constructed Responses", p. 23. In: ''Automated Essay Scoring: A Cross-Disciplinary Perspective''. Shermis, Mark D., and Jill Burstein, eds. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, New Jersey, {{ISBN|0805839739}}&lt;/ref&gt; An instrument is valid if it actually measures the trait that it purports to measure. It is fair if it does not, in effect, penalize or privilege any one class of people. It is reliable if its outcome is repeatable, even when irrelevant external factors are altered.

Before computers entered the picture, high-stakes essays were typically given scores by two trained human raters. If the scores differed by more than one point, a third, more experienced rater would settle the disagreement. In this system, there is an easy way to measure reliability: by [[Inter-rater reliability|inter-rater agreement]]. If raters do not consistently agree within one point, their training may be at fault. If a rater consistently disagrees with whichever other raters look at the same essays, that rater probably needs more training.

Various statistics have been proposed to measure inter-rater agreement. Among them are percent agreement, [[Scott's Pi|Scott's π]], [[Cohen's kappa|Cohen's κ]], [[Krippendorff's Alpha|Krippendorf's α]], [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson's correlation coefficient r]], [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] ρ, and Lin's [[concordance correlation coefficient]].

Percent agreement is a simple statistic applicable to grading scales with scores from 1 to n, where usually 4 ≤ n ≤ 6. It is reported as three figures, each a percent of the total number of essays scored: exact agreement (the two raters gave the essay the same score), adjacent agreement (the raters differed by at most one point; this includes exact agreement), and extreme disagreement (the raters differed by more than two points). Expert human graders were found to achieve exact agreement on 53% to 81% of all essays, and adjacent agreement on 97% to 100%.&lt;ref name="Elliot_2003b"&gt;Elliot, Scott (2003), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burstein_2003b"&gt;Burstein, Jill (2003), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inter-rater agreement can now be applied to measuring the computer's performance. A set of essays is given to two human raters and an AES program. If the computer-assigned scores agree with one of the human raters as well as the raters agree with each other, the AES program is considered reliable. Alternatively, each essay is given a "true score" by taking the average of the two human raters' scores, and the two humans and the computer are compared on the basis of their agreement with the true score.

Some researchers have reported that their AES systems can, in fact, do better than a human. Page made this claim for PEG in 1994.&lt;ref name="Page_1994" /&gt; Scott Elliot said in 2003 that IntelliMetric typically outperformed human scorers.&lt;ref name="Elliot_2003a" /&gt;  AES machines, however, appear to be less reliable than human readers for any kind of complex writing test.&lt;ref name=Bennett_2006&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bennett|first1=Randy E.|title=Technology and Writing Assessment: Lessons Learned from the US National Assessment of Educational Progress|url=http://www.iaea.info/documents/paper_1162a26d7.pdf|website=International Association for Educational Assessment|accessdate=5 July 2015|date=May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCurry|first1=D.|title=Can machine scoring deal with broad and open writing tests as well as human readers?|journal=Assessing Writing|date=2010|volume=15|pages=118–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=R.

In current practice, high-stakes assessments such as the GMAT are always scored by at least one human. AES is used in place of a second rater. A human rater resolves any disagreements of more than one point.&lt;ref name="Yang_2002"&gt;Yang, Yongwei, Chad W. Buckendahl, Piotr J. Juszkiewicz, and Dennison S. Bhola (2002).

==Criticism==
AES has been criticized on various grounds. Yang et al. mention "the overreliance on surface features of responses, the insensitivity to the content of responses and to creativity, and the vulnerability to new types of cheating and test-taking strategies."&lt;ref name="Yang_2002" /&gt; Several critics are concerned that students' motivation will be diminished if they know that no human will read their writing.&lt;ref name="Wang_2007b"&gt;Wang, Jinhao, and Michelle Stallone Brown (2007), pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dikli_2006"&gt;Dikli, Semire (2006).

Within weeks, the petition gained thousands of signatures, including [[Noam Chomsky]],&lt;ref name=HumanReaders_Signatures&gt;{{cite web|title=Signatures &gt;&gt; Professionals Against Machine Scoring Of Student Essays In High-Stakes Assessment|url=http://humanreaders.org/petition/results.php|work=HumanReaders.Org|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was cited in a number of newspapers, including ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name=Markoff_2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|title=Essay-Grading Software Offers Professors a Break|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/science/new-test-for-computers-grading-essays-at-college-level.html|accessdate=5 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Larson_2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Larson|first=Leslie|title=Outrage over software that automatically grades college essays to spare professors from having to assess students'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2304317/Outrage-software-automatically-grades-college-essays-spare-professors-having-assess-students-work.html|accessdate=5 April 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garner_2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Garner|first=Richard|title=Professors angry over essays marked by computer|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/professors-angry-over-essays-marked-by-computer-8562276.html|accessdate=5 April 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on a number of education and technology blogs.&lt;ref name=Corrigan_2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Corrigan|first=Paul T.|title=Petition Against Machine Scoring Essays, HumanReaders.Org|url=http://teachingandlearninginhighered.org/2013/03/25/petition-against-machine-scoring-essays-humanreaders-org/|work=Teaching &amp; Learning in Higher Ed.|accessdate=5 April 2013|date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaffee_2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Jaffee|first=Robert David|title=Computers Cannot Read, Write or Grade Papers|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-david-jaffee/computers-cannot-read_b_3018372.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=5 April 2013|date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The petition describes the use AES for high-stakes testing as "trivial", "reductive", "inaccurate", "undiagnostic", "unfair", and "secretive".&lt;ref name=HumanReaders_Petition&gt;{{cite web|title=Professionals Against Machine Scoring Of Student Essays In High-Stakes Assessment|url=http://humanreaders.org/petition/|work=HumanReaders.Org|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a detailed summary of research on AES, the petition site notes, "RESEARCH FINDINGS SHOW THAT no one—students, parents, teachers, employers, administrators, legislators—can rely on machine scoring of essays ... AND THAT machine scoring does not measure, and therefore does not promote, authentic acts of writing."&lt;ref name=HumanReaders_Research&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Findings  &gt;&gt; Professionals Against Machine Scoring Of Student Essays In High-Stakes Assessment|url=http://humanreaders.org/petition/research_findings.htm|work=HumanReaders.Org|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanReaders_Citations&gt;{{cite web|title=Works Cited &gt;&gt; Professionals Against Machine Scoring Of Student Essays In High-Stakes Assessment|url=http://humanreaders.org/petition/works_cited.htm|work=HumanReaders.Org|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The petition specifically addresses the use of AES for high-stakes testing and says nothing about other possible uses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2681">A '''bar review''' is a series of classes that most [[law school]] graduates in the [[United States]] attend prior to taking a [[bar examination]], in order to prepare for that exam.&lt;ref&gt;George E.

Roadmap: An International Student's Guide to U.S. Law School Programs'' (2013), Chapter 27, E-8.&lt;/ref&gt; A typical bar review course will last for several weeks, beginning a few weeks after law school graduation and running until a few weeks before the next administration of the bar examination.&lt;ref&gt;Ransford C.

Bar review courses are heavily marketed to graduating law students, as noted by Judge [[Diarmuid O'Scannlain]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which examined that practice in an [[unfair competition]] case:

{{quote|Bar review course sponsors compete for potential customers on law school campuses through distribution of advertising fliers, sponsored student events, and advertisements in student newspapers. These businesses promote their courses directly to law students throughout their three years of law school. Some law students are employed as sales representatives to market courses to their classmates, and full-time sales personnel "table sit" at law schools to promote their firm's courses.&lt;ref name="O'Scannlain"/&gt;}}

Many companies offering bar review courses also offer a component to prepare bar takers for the [[Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination]] (MPRE).&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Darrow-Kleinhaus, ''Acing the Bar Exam'' (2016), p. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2105">'''''Basic Concepts in Music Education''''' is a landmark work published in 1958 as the Fifty-Seventh Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education. In 1954, the Music Educators National Conference ([[MENC: The National Association for Music Education|MENC]]) had formed its Commission on Basic Concepts in an attempt to seek a more soundly-based philosophical foundation. The work of the commission resulted in the publication of ''Basic Concepts,'' which advocated an aesthetic justification for [[music education]]. According to the aesthetic philosophy, music education should be justified for its own sake rather than for its extra-musical benefits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16535">'''The Curriculum Open-Access Resources in Economics Project''' ('''CORE Project''') is an organisation that creates and distributes teaching material for [[economics]] curriculum reform. Its textbook is taught as an introductory course at more than 100 universities. It provides its materials online, at no cost to users. It is registered as a charity&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title=CORE Economics Education|url=https://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1175143&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|website=The Charity Commission|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CORE Economics Education) in England and Wales.

==Origins==

CORE was conceived in late 2012, by Professors [[Wendy Carlin]] of University college London and [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] of the Santa Fe Institute, and [[:es:Óscar_Landerretche_Moreno|Oscar Landerretche]], who at that time was Director of the School of Economics and Business of the University of Chile&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/olanderretche|title=Oscar Landerretche|website=Institute for New Economic Thinking|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At the time, Professor Carlin wrote to colleagues to suggest they collaborate to revise the curriculum, noting that "altering the course of the undergraduate curriculum is like turning around a half a million ton super tanker. But I think that the time may be right for the initiative I am inviting you to join me in proposing."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rajivsethi.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/the-core-project.html?spref=tw|title=The CORE Project|website=rajivsethi.blogspot.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Global economic crisis of 2008-09|global economic crisis of 2008]], students had formed groups, such as the [[International Student Initiative for Pluralist Economics]] (ISIPE) and [[Rethinking Economics]], to demand improvements to the mainstream economics curriculum. ISIPE, for example, argued that "teaching in economics departments is too narrowly focused and more effort should be made to broaden the curriculum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inman|first1=Philip|title=Economics students call for shakeup of the way their subject is taught|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/may/04/economics-students-overhaul-subject-teaching|accessdate=4 May 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Professor Carlin has written that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The textbook model is definitely broken. In it, economic actors are amoral and self-interested, [[perfectly competitive]] market prices equate supply to demand implementing “optimal” outcomes, while [[environmental degradation]], [[instability]], and [[Inequality in economics|inequality]] are afterthoughts at best … Yet it continues as the backbone of much undergraduate teaching. However remote from what economists really do and the way we think, this is the “economics” imprinted on the public’s mind."&lt;ref name="CarlinProspect"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlin|first1=Wendy|title=How a new economics syllabus is preparing students for the real-world economy|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/new-economics-model-teaching-syllabus|publisher=Prospect Magazine|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Launched in October 2013 at [[HM Treasury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Rob|title=Institute for New Economic Thinking Launches Project to Reform Undergraduate Syllabus|url=https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/institute-for-new-economic-thinking-launches-project-to-reform-undergraduate-syllabus|website=Institute for New Economic Thinking|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, CORE said its mission was to address these issues by creating a textbook incorporating contributions from many academics with different points of view that was "humbler, more empirical and more topical".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f015a3ac-4aed-11e3-ac3d-00144feabdc0|title=‘Dismal science’ seeks fresh thinking after failure in crisis|date=2013-11-11|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Carlin wrote that students "are embarrassed when they are no more able to explain the eurozone crisis or persistent unemployment than their fellow students in engineering or archaeology", and that CORE would ensure that "digital technology and interactive teaching methods will introduce students to an [[Empirical research|empirical]] discipline. They will learn to use evidence from history, experiments and other data sources to test competing explanations and policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/74cd0b94-4de6-11e3-8fa5-00144feabdc0#axzz2kwVkkxys|title=Economics explains our world – but economics degrees don’t|last=Carlin|first=Wendy|date=17 November 2013|work=Financial Times|access-date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course material==

CORE's courses are offered through [[open access]] online [[E-book|ebooks]] published on [http://core-econ.org its web site]. Its ebooks use a [[Creative Commons]] license&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; so that "any user can customize, translate, or improve it for their own use or the use of their students."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===''The Economy''===

''[http://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/ The Economy]'' was designed as the source material for taught courses in the first year of an undergraduate degree, although it has also been used in schools, and for advanced courses in public policy. In 2017, a print version of ''The Economy'' was published by Oxford University Press.&lt;ref name="Economy book" /&gt;

===''Economy, Society and Public Policy (ESPP)''===

In 2018, CORE posted the first units of ''[http://www.core-econ.org/espp/ ESPP]'', an ebook designed to introduce the economics to non-specialists, particularly students from outside economics courses who were taking economics as a minor. Like ''The Economy'', it focuses on topics such as inequality, power, and environmental economics. ESPP is funded by the [[Nuffield Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/economy-society-and-public-policy-quantitative-economics-course-non-specialists-core-project|title=Economy, Society and Public Policy - new course from coreecon {{!}} Nuffield Foundation|website=www.nuffieldfoundation.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Doing Economics''===

Also in 2018, CORE posted the first beta units of ''[http://www.core-econ.org/doing-economics/ Doing Economics]'', a collection of empirical projects designed to teach [[Quantitative Methods|quantitative methods]] in economics using real-world data, also funded by the Nuffield Foundation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Structure and contributors==

CORE Economics Education is registered as a charity in England and Wales, with a board of trustees.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The day-to-day running of the project is based at [[University College London]]. The course and support materials have been created by academic economists who volunteer their time, including [[Yann Algan]] ([[Sciences Po]], Paris), [[Timothy Besley]] ([[London School of Economics]]), [[Diane Coyle]] ([[University of Manchester]]), [[Cameron Hepburn]] ([[University of Oxford]]), and [[Kevin O'Rourke|Kevin O’Rourke]] ([[University of Oxford]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.core-econ.org/contributors/?filter%5B0%5D=2&amp;search=|title=Contributors - CORE|work=CORE|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The steering group is [[Wendy Carlin]] ([[University College London]]), [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] ([[Santa Fe Institute]]), [https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/faculty/margaret-stevens Margaret Stevens] (head of the Department of Economics, [[University of Oxford]]), and [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93scar_Landerretche_Moreno Oscar Landerretche], the president of [[Codelco]]. In 2017, [http://www.core-econ.org/project/core-usa/ CORE USA], based at [[Barnard College]], was set up to improve outreach in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.core-econ.org/project/core-usa/|title=CORE USA - CORE|work=CORE|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prominent economists have contributed to the published material&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.core-econ.org/contributors/?filter%5B0%5D=contributors&amp;search=|title=Contributors - CORE|work=CORE|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including Nobel laureates [[James Heckman]], [[Alvin E. Roth|Alvin Roth]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]], who recorded videos for it on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X83gk4PvIRc inequality in education], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7vzgexzXOk matching markets] and the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_W9SsstO9Y&amp;t=2s financial crisis].

===Funding===
CORE funds its projects through grants. Startup funding was provided by the [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]]. Current Funders include the [[Nuffield Foundation]], [[HM Treasury]], [http://www.friendsprovidentfoundation.org/ Friends Provident Foundation], [[Bank of England|The Bank of England]], and the [[International Economic Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.core-econ.org/funders/|title=Funders - CORE|work=CORE|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from existing economics teaching==

CORE's authors claim that popular textbooks such as ''Principles of Economics'' by [[Greg Mankiw]] are little different in content to the first modern text book, ''[[Economics (textbook)|Economics]]'' by [[Paul Samuelson]], which was published in 1948.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/new-paradigm-introductory-course-economics|title=A new paradigm for the introductory course in economics|last=Bowles|first=Samuel|last2=Carlin|first2=Wendy|date=2017-09-07|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, meaning that these textbooks have ignored many of the innovations in economics since then:&lt;blockquote&gt;"What we teach [students] in our intro classes bears little resemblance to how we do economics ourselves. The great mid-20th century thinkers – [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]] – initiated a process that eventually transformed how we now understand the economy, in three ways. Only one of these [Keynes] made it into today's principles course."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;CORE argues that concepts developed in the second half of the 20th century, such as [[asymmetric information]], strategic [[social interactions]] and [[incomplete contracts]] should be given greater prominence in undergraduate teaching. It claims that in most universities these ideas are "mentioned, if at all, at the end of the introductory course, or as special topics."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Critical reception===
''The Economy'' has been received favourably. ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote that "[e]arly results are promising":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Economy'' does not dumb down economics; it uses maths readily, keeping students engaged through the topicality of the material. Quite early on, students have lessons in the weirdness in economics—from game theory to power dynamics within firms—that makes the subject fascinating and useful but are skimmed over in most introductory courses.&lt;ref name="CORE Economist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Economist|first1=The|title=The teaching of economics gets an overdue overhaul|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21729443-students-are-forced-grapple-real-world-very-beginning-their|website=Free Exchange|accessdate=4 May 2018|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In [[The New Yorker]], [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] wrote that "The members of the core team deserve credit for responding to the critics of economics without pandering to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-new-way-to-learn-economics|title=A New Way to Learn Economics|last=Cassidy|first=John|date=2017-09-11|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Times Higher Education Supplement]] called the course "a bold revamp" and wrote that taking CORE in year 1 had improved results in year 2 for students at [[University College London]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The proportion of students gaining a first in the second-year [[microeconomics]] module rose from 22 per cent in 2014-15 to 32 per cent in 2015-16, while the proportion awarded third-class honours fell from 28 per cent to 11 per cent. ... In [[macroeconomics]], the proportion gaining firsts was unchanged, but the number who attained a 2:1 rose from 21 per cent in 2014-15 to 36 per cent in 2015-16."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/students-thrive-thanks-freakonomics-revamp-economics|title=Students thrive thanks to ‘Freakonomics revamp’ of economics|date=2017-01-05|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Criticism of approach===

Some curriculum reform campaigners have criticised CORE for being too narrow and prescriptive, and not acknowledging competing schools of thought. Daniel Lapedus, the [[Rethinking Economics]] welcomed CORE’s "incorporation of a variety of thinkers in their curriculum, as well as their efforts to make economics more real and engaging for economics students ... But real critical [[Pluralism in economics|pluralism]] that reflects the true diversity of real-world perspectives is still a long way off. There is plenty more rethinking yet to be done."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/neweconomics/will-real-rethinkers-please-stand/|title=Will the real rethinkers please stand up? - New thinking for the British economy|website=www.opendemocracy.net|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuan Yang, one of the founders of [[Rethinking Economics]], told [[Financial Times|The Financial Times]] that: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Core is not a pluralist curriculum ... It presents one paradigm, while students should be able to choose among different schools of thought.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/fc2eb464-d93d-11e4-b907-00144feab7de|title=Students weigh the value of new economics course|last=Guigliano|first=Ferdinando|date=10 April 2015|work=The Financial Times|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{accounting}}
'''Certified Public Accountant''' ('''CPA''') is the title of qualified accountants in numerous countries in the English-speaking world. In the [[United States]], the CPA is a license to provide accounting services to the public. It is awarded by each of the 50 states for practice in that state. Additionally, almost every state (49 out of 50) has passed mobility laws to allow CPAs from other states to practice in their state. State licensing requirements vary, but the minimum standard requirements include passing the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination]], 150 semester units of college education, and one year of accounting related experience.

Continuing professional education (CPE) is also required to maintain licensure. Individuals who have been awarded the CPA but have lapsed in the fulfillment of the required CPE or who have requested conversion to inactive status are in many states permitted to use the designation "CPA Inactive" or an equivalent phrase. In most U.S. states, only CPAs are legally able to provide attestation (including auditing) opinions on [[financial statement]]s. Many CPAs are members of the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] and their state CPA society.

State laws vary widely regarding whether a non-CPA is even allowed to use the title "accountant." For example, [[Texas]] prohibits the use of the designations "accountant" and "auditor" by a person not certified as a Texas CPA, unless that person is a CPA in another state, is a non-resident of Texas, and otherwise meets the requirements for practice in Texas by out-of-state CPA firms and practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/txstatutes/OC/5/A/901/J/901.453 |title=Texas OC. Code Ann. Sec. 901.453 |publisher=Codes.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination#Non-U.S. candidates|Many other countries]] also use the title CPA to designate local public accountants.

==Services provided==
One important function performed by CPAs relates to [[assurance services]]. The most commonly performed assurance services are [[financial audit]] services where CPAs attest to the reasonableness of disclosures, the freedom from material misstatement, and the adherence to the applicable [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP) in financial statements. CPAs can also be employed within corporations (termed "the private sector") in finance or operations positions such as financial analyst, finance manager, controller, chief financial officer (CFO), or chief executive officer (CEO). These CPAs do not provide services directly to the public.

Although some CPA firms serve as business consultants, the consulting role has been under scrutiny following the [[Enron scandal]] where [[Arthur Andersen]] simultaneously provided audit and consulting services which affected their ability to maintain independence in their audit duties. This incident resulted in many accounting firms divesting in their consulting divisions, but this trend has since reversed. In audit engagements, CPAs are (and have always been) required by professional standards and Federal and State laws to maintain independence (both in fact and in appearance) from the entity for which they are conducting an attestation (audit and review) engagement. Although most individual CPAs who work as consultants do not also work as auditors, if the CPA firm is auditing the same company that the firm also does consulting work for, then there is a conflict of interest. This conflict voids the CPA firm's independence for multiple reasons, including: (1) the CPA firm would be auditing its own work or the work the firm suggested, and (2) the CPA firm may be pressured into unduly giving a positive (unmodified) audit opinion so as not to jeopardize the consulting revenue the firm receives from the client.

CPAs also have a niche within the income tax return preparation industry. Many small to mid-sized firms have both a tax and an auditing department. Along with attorneys and [[Enrolled Agent]]s, CPAs may represent taxpayers in matters before the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS). Although the IRS regulates the practice of tax representation, it has no authority to regulate tax return preparers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants =Loving v. IRS | court =US Court of Appeals, for the District of Columbia | date =2014 | url=https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/B63C3129A4FE761985257C7C00539949/$file/13-5061-1479431.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states also allow unlicensed accountants to work as public accountants. For example, California allows unlicensed accountants to work as public accountants if they work under the control and supervision of a CPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Cal Bus. &amp; Prof. Code Section 5053}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the California Board of Accountancy itself has determined that the terms "accountant" and "accounting" are misleading to members of the public, many of whom believe that a person who uses these terms must be licensed. As part of the California Poll, survey research showed that 55 percent of Californians believe that a person who advertises as an "accountant" must be licensed, 26 percent did not believe a license was required, and 19 percent did not know.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants =Moore v. California State Board of Accountancy | vol =2 | reporter =Cal.4th | opinion =999 | date =1992 | url=https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/4th/2/999.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether providing services directly to the public or employed by corporations or associations, CPAs can operate in virtually any area of finance including:
* [[Assurance services|Assurance]] and attestation services
* [[Corporate finance]] (merger and acquisition, initial public offerings, share and debt issuings)
* [[Corporate governance]]
* [[Estate planning]]
* [[Financial accounting]]
* [[Governmental accounting]]
* [[Financial analysis]]
* [[Financial planning]]
* [[Forensic accounting]] (preventing, detecting, and investigating financial frauds)
* [[Income tax]]
* [[Information technology]], especially as applied to accounting and auditing
* [[Management consulting]] and performance management
* [[Tax preparation]] and planning
* [[Venture capital]]
* [[Financial reporting]]
* [[Regulatory compliance]]

==CPA exam==
{{Main|Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination}}

To become a CPA in the United States, the candidate must sit for and pass the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination]] (Uniform CPA Exam), which is set by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] ([[AICPA]]) and administered by the [[National Association of State Boards of Accountancy]] (NASBA). The CPA designation was first established in law in New York State on April 17, 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Flesher, D.L.|author2=Previts, G.J.|author3=Flesher, T.K.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Profiling the New Industrial Professionals: The First CPAs of 1896–97|publisher=Business &amp; Economic History, volume 25, 1996|url=http://www.h-net.org/~business/bhcweb/publications/BEHprint/v025n1/p0252-p0266.pdf|accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eligibility to sit for the Uniform CPA Exam is determined by individual state boards of accountancy. Many states have adopted what is known as the "150 hour rule" (150 college semester units or the equivalent), which usually requires an additional year of education past a regular 4 year college degree, or a master's degree.  Some universities offer a 5-year combined bachelor's/master's degree program, allowing a student to earn both degrees while receiving the 150 hours needed for exam eligibility.

The Uniform CPA Exam tests general principles of state law such as the laws of [[contract]]s and [[Law of agency|agency]] (questions not tailored to the variances of any particular state) and some federal laws as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=See generally ''Uniform CPA Examination: Examination Content Specifications'', American Inst. of Certified Public Accountants, p. 11-12 (orig. issued June 14, 2002; references updated October 19, 2005)|url=http://www.cpa-exam.org/download/CPA_Exam_CSOs_revised_10_05.pdf|publisher=Cpa-exam.org|accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other licensing and certification requirements==
Although the CPA exam is uniform, licensing and certification requirements are imposed separately by each state's laws and therefore vary from state to state.

State requirements for the CPA qualification can be summed up as the ''Three Es''—Education, Examination and Experience. The education requirement normally must be fulfilled as part of the eligibility criteria to sit for the Uniform CPA Exam. The examination component is the Uniform CPA Exam itself. Some states have a two-tier system whereby an individual would first become certified—usually by passing the Uniform CPA Exam. That individual would then later be eligible to be licensed once a certain amount of work experience is accomplished. Other states have a one-tier system whereby an individual would be certified and licensed at the same time when both the CPA exam is passed and the work experience requirement has been met.

Two-tier states include [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], [[Illinois]], [[Montana]], and [[Nebraska]]. The trend is for two-tier states to gradually move towards a one-tier system. Since 2002, the state boards of accountancy in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[South Dakota]] have ceased issuing CPA "certificates" and instead issue CPA "licenses." Illinois planned to follow suit in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislative sunset provision for two-tier designation of CPAs in Illinois (Illinois General Assembly)|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/billstatus.asp?DocNum=6415&amp;GAID=10&amp;GA=96&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;LegID=52442&amp;SessionID=76|publisher=Ilga.gov|accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of states are two-tiered, but require work experience for the CPA certificate, such as [[Ohio]] and [http://www.dos.pa.gov/ProfessionalLicensing/BoardsCommissions/Accountancy/Pages/default.aspx Pennsylvania].

===Work experience requirement===
The experience component varies from state to state:
* The two-tier states generally do not require that the individual have work experience to receive a CPA certificate. (Work experience is required, however, to receive a license to practice.)
* Some states, such as [[Massachusetts]], waive the work experience requirement for those with a higher academic qualification compared to the state's requirement to appear for the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination|Uniform CPA]].  
* The majority of states still require work experience to be of a ''public accounting'' nature, namely two years audit or tax experience, or a combination of both. An increasing number of states, however, including [[Oregon]], [[Virginia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Kentucky]], accept experience of a more general nature in the accounting area. In Texas, only one year of experience in accounting under the supervision of a CPA is required; such experience does not have to be in public accounting. This allows persons to obtain the CPA designation while working for a corporation's finance function.
* The majority of states require an applicant's work experience to be verified by someone who is already licensed as a CPA. This requirement can cause difficulties for applicants based outside the United States. However, some states such as Colorado and Oregon also accept work experience certified by a [[Chartered Accountant]].

===Ethics===
Over 40 of the state boards now require applicants for CPA status to complete a special examination on [[ethics]], which is effectively a ''fifth exam'' in terms of requirements to become a CPA.  The majority of these accept the AICPA self-study ''Professional Ethics for CPAs'' [[#Continuing professional education|CPE]] course or another course in general professional ethics. Many states, however, require that the ethics course include a review of that state's specific rules for professional practice.

===Continuing professional education===
Like other professionals, CPAs are required to take [[continuing education]] courses toward [[continuing professional development]] (continuing professional education [CPE]) to renew their license. Requirements vary by state (Wisconsin does not require any CPE for CPAs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sequoiacpe.com/wisconsin-cpe-requirements |title=Wisconsin CPA CPE Requirements |publisher=Continuing Education Requirements |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mypescpe.com/open/viewStateLicDisplay.Open.cmc |title=State Requirements |publisher=Professional Education Services CPE |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but the vast majority require an average of 40 hours of CPE every year with a minimum of 20 hours per calendar year. The requirement can be fulfilled through attending live seminars, webcast seminars, or through self-study (textbooks, videos, online courses, all of which require a test to receive credit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicpa.org/Advocacy/State/DownloadableDocuments/AICPA-NASBA-Final-CPE-Standards.pdf |title=Statement of Standards for CPE Programs|publisher=AICPA |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, state boards accept group live and group internet-based credits for all credit requirements, while some states cap the number of credits obtained through the self-study format. All CPAs are encouraged to periodically review their state requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ceworkshops.com/2015-Continuing-Professional-Education-Snapshot_b_5.html |title=2015 Continuing Professional Education Snapshot|publisher=McDevitt &amp; Kline, LLC |date= |accessdate=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the CPE requirement, most states require their CPAs to take an ethics course at some frequency (such as every or every other renewal period). Ethics requirements vary by state and the courses range from 2–8 hours. AICPA guidelines (which are adopted by many state boards) grant licensees 1 hour of CPE credit for every 50 minutes of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mypescpe.com/CPE-State-Accreditation-Information.cmc?&amp;view=4D |title=CPE State Accreditation Information |publisher=Professional Education Services CPE |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpa2biz.com/content/media/producer_content/generic_template_content/cperequirements.jsp |title=CPE Requirements |publisher=AICPA |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of licensure===
A CPA license may be suspended or revoked for various reasons.  Common reasons include these:
*Allowing the license to lapse without renewing in a timely manner.
*Performing attestation services under an unlicensed/unregistered CPA firm or under a CPA firm permit which has expired.
*Continuing to hold out as an active CPA on an expired license, which includes continued use of the CPA title on business cards, letterhead, office signage, correspondence, etc. after the license has expired.
*Using fraud or deceit in obtaining or renewing the CPA license, the most common occurrence being misrepresenting or falsifying compliance with or completion of the continuing education requirements as a condition for renewal.
*"Discreditable acts", which can include 1) failure to follow applicable standards (such as auditing standards when examining financial statements, or tax code when preparing tax returns) or 2) violation of felony or serious misdemeanor criminal laws (which may or not be related to the practice of accountancy; a notable example of a CPA whose license was revoked for a non-financial related criminal law is [[John Battaglia]], convicted of the capital murders of his children)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsbpa.texas.gov/php/fpl/indlookup.php?x=5Rp8bo1dZ%2BE%3D |title=Texas State Board of Public Accountancy Individual Detail |publisher=Tsbpa.texas.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other accounting designations sometimes confused with CPA==
Many states had (although a few still do) a second tier of accountant qualification in addition to that of CPA, usually entitled "Public Accountant" or "Licensed Public Accountant" (with designatory letters "PA" or "LPA"), although other titles have included "Registered Public Accountant" (RPA), "Accounting Practitioner" (AP), and "Registered Accounting Practitioner" (RAP). Such designations served to help regulate the practice of public accounting in that state by grandfathering through licensure non-CPA accountants who were already practicing public accounting before a regulatory state accountancy law was enacted. The majority of states have closed the designation "Public Accountant" (PA) to new entrants, with only five states continuing to offer the designation. Many PAs belong to the [[National Society of Accountants]].

Many states prohibit the use of the designations "Public Accountant" or "Licensed Public Accountant" (or the abbreviations "PA" or "LPA") by a person who is not certified as a PA in that state.

In [[Australia]] the designation "Public Accountant" is used by members of the [[Institute of Public Accountants]] of Australia.

==Practice mobility==
An accountant is required to meet the legal requirements of any state in which the accountant wishes to practice.

In recent years, practice mobility for CPAs has become a major business concern for CPAs and their clients. Practice mobility for CPAs is the general ability of a licensee in good standing from a substantially equivalent state to gain practice privilege outside of their home state without getting an additional license in the state where the CPA will serve a client or an employer. In today's digital age, many organizations requiring the professional services of CPAs conduct business on an interstate and international basis and have compliance responsibilities in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, the practice of CPAs often extends across state lines and international boundaries.&lt;ref name="UAA Background"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicpa.org/Advocacy/State/DownloadableDocuments/UAASixthEdition.pdf |title=August 2011 : We are pleased to announce that the Uniform Accountancy Act (UAA), Sixth Edition, August 2011, is now available |publisher=AICPA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208124716/http://www.aicpa.org/Advocacy/State/DownloadableDocuments/UAASixthEdition.pdf |archivedate=February 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differing requirements for CPA certification, reciprocity, temporary practice and other aspects of state accountancy legislation in the 55 U.S. licensing jurisdictions (the 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) make the interstate practice and mobility of CPAs more complicated. By removing boundaries to practice in the U.S., CPAs are able to more readily serve individuals and businesses in need of their expertise. At the same time, the state board of accountancy's ability to discipline is enhanced by being based on a CPA and the CPA firm's performance of services (either physically, electronically or otherwise within a state), rather than being based on whether a state license is held.&lt;ref name="UAA Background" /&gt;

The [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) and the [[National Association of State Boards of Accountancy]] (NASBA) have analyzed the current system for gaining practice privileges across state lines and have endorsed a uniform mobility system. This model approach is detailed through the substantial equivalency provision (Section 23) of the Uniform Accountancy Act (UAA). The UAA is an "evergreen" model licensing law co-developed, maintained, reviewed and updated by the AICPA and NASBA.  The model provides a uniform approach to regulation of the accounting profession.&lt;ref name="UAA Background" /&gt;

Under Section 23 of the UAA, a CPA with a license in good standing from a jurisdiction with CPA licensing requirements essentially equivalent to those outlined in the UAA is deemed to be “substantially equivalent,” or a licensee who individually meets the requirements of:
* Obtaining 150 credit hours (150 college semester units or the equivalent) with a baccalaureate degree 
* Minimum one year of CPA experience 
* Passing the Uniform CPA Examination

Uniform adoption of the UAA's substantial equivalency provision creates a system similar to the nation's driver's license program by providing CPAs with mobility while retaining and strengthening state boards’ ability to protect the public interest. The system enables consumers to receive timely services from the CPA best suited to the job, regardless of location, and without the hindrances of unnecessary filings, forms and increased costs that do not protect the public interest.&lt;ref name="UAA Background" /&gt;

As of October 2012, a total of 49 out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia have passed mobility laws and are now in the implementation and navigation phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicpa.org/Advocacy/State/PublishingImages/CPA_Mobility_Map.pdf |title=AICPA : CPA Mobility Map |publisher=Aicpa.org |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Guam have not passed mobility laws. On September 20, California Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation that permits cross-border mobility for CPAs.  The law went into effect July 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/News/20126510 |title=California becomes 49th state to pass CPA mobility law |publisher=Journalofaccountancy.com |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The District of Columbia passed mobility laws that went into effect on October 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/News/20126555 |title=CPA mobility law takes effect in Washington |publisher=Journalofaccountancy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AICPA membership==
The CPA designation is granted by individual state boards, not the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA). Membership in the AICPA is not obligatory for CPAs, although some CPAs do join. To become a full member of AICPA, the applicant must hold a valid CPA certificate or license from at least one of the fifty-five U.S. state/territory boards of accountancy; some additional requirements apply.

AICPA members approved a proposed bylaw amendment to make eligible for voting membership individuals who previously held a CPA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpaexam.com |title=Bisk CPA Review |publisher=CPA Exam |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; certificate/license or have met all the requirements for CPA certification in accordance with the Uniform Accountancy Act (UAA).  The AICPA announced its plan to accept applications from individuals meeting these criteria, beginning no later than January 1, 2011.

==State CPA association membership==
CPAs may also choose to become members of their local state association or society (also optional). Benefits of membership in a state CPA association range from deep discounts on seminars that qualify for continuing education credits to protecting the public and profession's interests by tracking and lobbying legislative issues that affect local state tax and financial planning issues.

CPAs who maintain state CPA society memberships are required to follow a society professional code of conduct (in addition to any code enforced by the state regulatory authority), further reassuring clients that the CPA is an ethical business professional conducting a legitimate business who can be trusted to handle confidential personal and business financial matters. State CPA associations also serve the community by providing information and resources about the CPA profession and welcome inquiries from students, business professionals and the public-at-large.

CPAs are not normally restricted to membership in the state CPA society in which they reside or hold a license or certificate. Many CPAs who live near state borders or who hold CPA status in more than one state may join more than one state CPA society.

'''Correctional nursing''', sometimes called '''forensic nursing''', is a specialized field of [[Nursing|nursing]] that involves caring for the medical and mental health needs of [[Prisoner|detainees and inmates]]. These nurses work in a variety of settings such as [[Prison|jails, prisons, and juvenile detention centers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Correctional Nursing - International Association of Forensic Nurses |url=https://www.forensicnurses.org/page/CorrectionalNursing |website=www.forensicnurses.org |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these correctional settings, nurses are the primary healthcare providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Almost |first1=Joan |last2=Gifford |first2=Wendy A |last3=Doran |first3=Diane |last4=Ogilvie |first4=Linda |last5=Miller |first5=Crystal |last6=Rose |first6=Don N |last7=Squires |first7=Mae |title=Correctional nursing: a study protocol to develop an educational intervention to optimize nursing practice in a unique context |journal=Implementation Science : IS |date=21 June 2013 |volume=8 |pages=71 |doi=10.1186/1748-5908-8-71 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3691633/ |accessdate=2 August 2018 |issn=1748-5908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles==
Because of the varying size of correctional facilities, there is a wide range of roles correctional nurses fill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nursing Careers with California Correctional Health Care Services, Apply Online |url=http://www.cphcs.ca.gov/hodes/nursing-careers.aspx |website=www.cphcs.ca.gov |accessdate=2 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some facilities are as large as small cities and include an in-house hospital with inpatient and emergency facilities. Most correctional nurses fall into four categories: Reception Screening, Chronic Care Clinicians, [[Medication]] Administration, and Ambulatory Care (often called, "sick call").

===Intake Screening===
Intake Screening is often called, "R&amp;R Screening" for, "Reception and Release". This is the process where nurses screen inmates entering the facility for a variety of immediate medical and mental health needs such as alcohol or drug withdrawal, suicide potential, trauma, infectious diseases, and necessity for chronic medications. Custody uses this information in order to decide which part of the facility is appropriate for housing, sometimes initiating movement to another facility if the inmate's needs cannot be met at the initial placement. The nurse performing intake screening generally schedules the inmate for an appointment with a healthcare provider for a detailed history and physical depending on the inmate's needs and presence of chronic diseases.

===Chronic Care Clinicians===
Inmates with chronic health care concerns ([[asthma]], [[diabetes]], [[high blood pressure]], etc.) generally have regularly scheduled appointments in chronic care clinics. Generally overseen by a [[physician]] or other mid level provider such as a [[nurse practitioner]]. Nurses here provide patient assessments and education about chronic health concerns. 

===Medication Administration=== 
Medications, even over-the-counter ones, can be misused in a correctional environment. Most frequently, medications are be administered to patients via a medication pass or pill line process. At scheduled times during the day, inmates requiring medication either report to a nurse located centrally in a medical unit or receive their doses in a housing unit.

===Nursing Sick Call===
Inmates requiring episodic health care generally follow a process called Sick Call. Inmates request treatment, generally by completing a form (a "Sick Call Slip") and are seen by a nurse. Most facilities have standardized protocols which allow administration of over-the-counter medications for simple conditions like [[headache]], [[athlete’s foot]], and [[constipation]] without the need for communication with a medical provider. An assessment of a more serious condition, or one that falls outside the protocols, would be referred to a provider for further evaluation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17747">The term '''culture industry''' ({{lang-de|Kulturindustrie}}) was coined by the [[critical theory|critical theorists]] [[Theodor Adorno]] (1903–1969) and [[Max Horkheimer]] (1895–1973), and was presented as critical vocabulary in the chapter "The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception", of the book ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1944), wherein they proposed that [[popular culture]] is akin to a factory producing standardized cultural goods—[[film]]s, [[radio]] programmes, [[magazine]]s, etc.—that are used to manipulate [[mass society]] into passivity.&lt;ref name="ADOR" /&gt; Consumption of the easy pleasures of popular culture, made available by the [[Mass media|mass communications media]], renders people docile and content, no matter how difficult their [[economic]] circumstances.&lt;ref name="ADOR"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horkheimer|first1=Max|last2=Adorno|first2=Theodor W.|last3=Ed. by Gunzelin Schmid Noerr.

In contrast, true psychological needs are [[free will|freedom]], [[creativity]], and genuine [[happiness]], which refer to an earlier demarcation of human needs, established by [[Herbert Marcuse]]. (See ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', 1955).&lt;ref name="MARC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcuse|first1=Herbert|title=Eros and civilization : a philosophical inquiry into Freud|date=1966|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-0807015544|edition=4. pr.|url=http://freudians.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Marcuse-Eros-and-Civilization-Part-II-Beyond-the-Reality-Principle.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Frankfurt School==
{{Frankfurt School}}
Members of The Frankfurt School were much influenced by the [[dialectical materialism]] and [[historical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]], as well as the revisitation of the dialectical [[idealism]] of [[Hegel]]; both events are studied not in isolation, but as part of the process of change. As a group later joined by [[Jürgen Habermas]], they were responsible for the formulation of [[critical theory]]. In works such as ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' and ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'', Adorno and Horkheimer theorized that the phenomenon of [[mass culture]] has a political implication, namely that all the many forms of popular culture are parts of a single ''culture industry'' whose purpose is to ensure the continued obedience of the ''masses'' to market interests.

==The theory==
The essay is concerned with the production of cultural content in capitalist societies. It critiques the supply-driven nature of cultural economies as well as the apparently inferior products of the system.&lt;ref name=Durham2003p66&gt;Durham (2003) p.66&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer and Adorno argue that mass-produced entertainment aims, by its very nature, to appeal to vast audiences and therefore both the intellectual stimulation of high art and the basic release of low art.&lt;ref&gt;Durham (2003) p.68&lt;/ref&gt; The essay does not suggest that all products of this system are inherently inferior, simply that they have replaced other forms of entertainment without properly fulfilling the important roles played by the now defunct sources of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Durham (2003) p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

Horkheimer and Adorno make consistent comparisons between [[Fascist Germany]] and the American film industry. They highlight the presence of mass-produced culture, created and disseminated by exclusive institutions and consumed by a passive, homogenised audience in both systems.&lt;ref&gt;Durham (2003) p.71&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates the logic of domination in post-enlightenment modern society, by monopoly capitalism or the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Scannell (2007) p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer and Adorno draw attention to the problems associated with a system that 'integrates its consumers from above', arguing that in attempting to realise enlightenment values of reason and order, the holistic power of the individual is undermined.&lt;ref&gt;Scannell (2007) p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Adorno and Horkheimer's work was influenced by both the broader socio-political environment in which it was written and by other major theorists. Written in California in the early 1940s in an era which characterized them as two ethnically Jewish, German émigrés, The Culture Industry is influenced by European politics and the war by which the continent was consumed.&lt;ref name="Scannell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scannell|first1=Paddy|title=Media and communication|date=2007|publisher=SAGE Publ.|location=Los Angeles [u.a.]|isbn=9781412902687|page=37|edition=Repr.|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=-LfZAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=jewish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, the American film industry was characterised by an unprecedented level of studio monopolisation,&lt;ref name=Durham2003p66 /&gt; it was "Hollywood at its most classical, American mass culture at its most Fordist".&lt;ref&gt;Hansen (1992) p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

Horkheimer and Adorno were influenced heavily by major developers of social, political and economic theory,&lt;ref&gt;Scannell (2007) pp.37–44&lt;/ref&gt; most notably:

* [[Karl Marx]]'s theories of alienation and commodity fetishism,
* [[Max Weber]]'s instrumental reason, and 
* [[Georg Lukacs]]' concept of the reification of consciousness.

==Elements==
{{Original research|section|discuss=Talk:Culture_industry#Original_research.3F|date=January 2017}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}} 
Anything made by a person is a materialization of their labour and an expression of their intentions. There will also be a use value: the benefit to the consumer will be derived from its utility. The exchange value will reflect its utility and the conditions of the market: the prices paid by the television broadcaster or at the box office. Yet, the modern [[soap opera]]s with their interchangeable plots and formulaic narrative conventions reflect standardized production techniques and the falling value of a mass-produced cultural product. Only rarely is a film released that makes a more positive impression on the general discourse and achieves a higher exchange value, e.g. ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'' (1970), starring [[George C. Scott]] as the eponymous American general, was released at a time of considerable anti-war sentiment. The opening shot is of Patton in front of an American flag making an impassioned speech. This was a form of [[dialectic]] in which the audience could identify with the patriotism either sincerely (the thesis) or ironically (the antithesis) and so set the tone of the interpretation for the remainder of the film. However, the film is manipulating specific historical events, not only as entertainment, but also as a form of propaganda by demonstrating a link between success in strategic resource management situations and specified leadership qualities. Given that the subtext was instrumental and not "value free", ethical and philosophical considerations arise.

Normally, only high art criticizes the world outside its boundaries, but access to this form of communication is limited to the elite classes where the risks of introducing social instability are slight. A film like ''Patton'' is popular art which intends controversy in a world of social order and unity which, according to Adorno, is regressing into a cultural blandness. To Hegel, order is good ''a priori'', i.e. it does not have to answer to those living under it. But, if order is disturbed? In ''Negative Dialectics'', Adorno believed this tended towards progress by stimulating the possibility of class conflict. Marx's theory of Historical Materialism was [[Teleology|teleological]], i.e. society follows through a dialectic of unfolding stages from ancient modes of production to feudalism to capitalism to a future communism. But Adorno felt that the culture industry would never permit a sufficient core of challenging material to emerge on to the market that might disturb the ''[[status quo]]'' and stimulate the final communist state to emerge.

==Mass culture==
A central point of the ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' is the topic of "the Enlightenment as the deception of the masses". The term "culture industry" is intended to refer to the commercial marketing of culture, the branch of industry that deals specifically with the production of culture that is in contrast to "authentic culture".

Horkheimer and Adorno contend that industrially produced culture robs people of their imagination and takes over their thinking for them. The culture industry delivers the "goods" so that the people then only have left the task of consuming them. Through mass production, everything becomes homogenized and whatever diversity remains is constituted of small trivialities. Everything becomes compressed through a process of the imposition of schemas under the premise that what's best is to mirror physical reality as closely as possible. Psychological drives become stoked to the point where [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] is no longer possible.

Movies serve as an example. "All films have become similar in their basic form. They are shaped to reflect facts of reality as closely as possible. Even fantasy films, which claim to not reflect such reality, don't really live up to what they claim to be. No matter how unusual they strive to be, the endings are usually easy to predict because of the existence of prior films which followed the same schemas. Also, for example, erotic depictions become so strong and so pronounced that a transformation to other forms is no longer possible."&lt;ref&gt;The Dialectic of Enlightenment&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The aims of the culture industry are—as in every industry—economic in nature. All endeavors become focused on economic success.

Authentic culture, however, is not goal-oriented, but is an end in itself. Authentic culture fosters the capacity of human imagination by presenting suggestions and possibilities, but in a different way than the culture industry does since it leaves room for independent thought. Authentic culture does not become channeled into regurgitating reality but goes levels beyond such. Authentic culture is unique and cannot be forced into any pre-formed schemas.

As for discovering the causes of the development of the culture industry, Horkheimer and Adorno contend that it arises from companies' pursuit of the maximization of profit, in the economic sense. However, this cannot be said to be culture, or what culture is supposed to be. It can only be described as being a form of commerce, just like any other kind of commerce.

The culture industry argument is often assumed to be fundamentally pessimistic in nature because its purveyors seem to condemn "mass media" and their consumers. 
However, for Adorno, the term "culture industry" does not refer to "mass culture", or the culture of the masses of people in terms of something being produced by the masses and conveying the representations of the masses. On the contrary, such involvement of the masses is only apparent, or a type of seeming democratic participation. Adorno contends that what is actually occurring is a type of "defrauding of the masses". Horkheimer and Adorno deliberately chose the term "culture industry" instead of "mass culture" or "mass media".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Behrens, Roger: ''Kritische Theorie''. Hamburg: Europäische Verlagsanstalt 2002, page 68.&lt;/ref&gt; "The culture industry perpetually cheats its consumers of what it perpetually promises."&lt;ref name="Horkheimer, Max 2006, page 145"&gt;Horkheimer, Max; Adorno, Theodor W.: ''Dialektik der Aufklärung. Philosophische Fragmente''. Frankfurt am Main: Fischer Verlag 16th edition 2006, page 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The culture industry even encroaches upon the small distractions of leisure activity: "Amusement has become an extension of labor under late capitalism."&lt;ref name="Horkheimer, Max 2006, page 145" /&gt; Horkheimer and Adorno, above all, in their critical analyses, delve into what they call "the fraying of art" and the "de-artification of art", and discuss how the arts are defused by the culture industry. Works of art have become commodified: Beethoven, Mozart and Wagner are only used in fragmentary forms when included in advertisement. According to Critical Theory, "selling out" is not the decisive factor involved, but rather it's the manner in which art is commodified and how art and culture are changed that is the crucial issue.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Behrens, Roger: ''Kritische Theorie''. Hamburg: Europäische Verlagsanstalt 2002, page 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Culture today is infecting everything with sameness."&lt;ref&gt;Horkheimer, Max; Adorno, Theodor W.: ''Dialektik der Aufklärung. Philosophische Fragmente''. Frankfurt am Main: Fischer Verlag 16th edition 2006, page 129.&lt;/ref&gt; For Adorno and Horkheimer, subversion has become no longer possible.

==Observations==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
Wiggershaus Rolf say that the products of [[mass culture]] would not be popular if people did not enjoy them, and that culture is self-determining in its administration. This would deny Adorno contemporary political significance, arguing that politics in a prosperous society is more concerned with action than with thought. He also notes that the young generation of critical theorists largely ignore Adorno's work which, in part, stems from Adorno's inability to draw practical conclusions from his theories. For instance, Wiggershaus states: "The other side of Adorno's apparently paradoxical definition was ignored: that only rational objectivity was still possible for the modern work of art was only possible, in any significant sense, as a product of subjectivity"&lt;ref name="Wiggershaus"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rolf|first1=Wiggershaus|last2=translated by: Michael|first2=Robertson|title=The Frankfurt School : its history, theories, and political significance|date=1995|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0262731133|pages=513|edition=1st MIT Press pbk.|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vZMjjW4uOWIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=The+Frankfurt+School+:+its+history,+theories,+and+political+significance&amp;ots=YIoZkLlBfC&amp;sig=hFjxWnRNLmkF2eMqJR48BpcpUiY#v=onepage&amp;q=Adorno%20thought%20art%20had%20lost%20its%20way%20and%20changed%20into%20ideology.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adorno is also accused of a lack of consistency in his claims to be implementing Marxism. Whereas he accepted the classical Marxist analysis of society showing how one class exercises domination over another, he deviated from Marx in his failure to use dialectic as a method to propose ways to change. Marx's theory depended on the willingness of the working class to overthrow the ruling class, but Adorno and Horkheimer postulated that the culture industry has undermined the revolutionary movement. 
Adorno's idea that the mass of the people are only objects of the culture industry is linked to his feeling that the time when the working class could be the tool of overthrowing capitalism is over. 
Other critics note that "High culture" too is not exempt from a role in the justification of capitalism. The establishment and reinforcement of [[elitism]] is seen by these critics as a key element in the role of such genres as [[opera]] and [[ballet]].

'''''Death at an Early Age: The Destruction of the Hearts and Minds of Negro Children in the Boston Public Schools''''' (reissue {{ISBN|0-452-26292-5}}) is a book written by the American schoolteacher [[Jonathan Kozol]] and published in Boston by [[Houghton Mifflin]] in 1967. It won the U.S. [[National Book Award]] in the [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Science, Philosophy and Religion|Science, Philosophy and Religion]] category.&lt;ref name=nba1968&gt;
[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1968 "National Book Awards – 1968"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book describes Kozol's first year of teaching, which took place in the Boston public school system. Kozol recounts the deeply entrenched policies of [[racial segregation]] and inequality on the part of [[Boston Public Schools]]; testifies to a crumbling infrastructure in his [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], [[Boston]], neighborhood; and documents the public outcry after his dismissal for teaching a [[Langston Hughes]] poem to his reading class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">A '''Diploma of Higher Education''' ('''DipHE''') is a [[higher education]] qualification in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Directgov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/QualificationsExplained/DG_10039026 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/QualificationsExplained/DG_10039026 |archivedate=2012-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is awarded after two years of full-time study at a [[university]] or other higher education institution &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucas.ac.uk/students/wheretostart/heexplained/coursetypes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Directgov"/&gt; and is rated as a Level 5 qualification on both the [[Regulated Qualifications Framework]] and the [[European Qualifications Framework]].

==Overview==
The Diploma certifies that a student has achieved a minimum standard for 2nd Year courses in science and liberal arts. If a student is undertaking a full Bachelor of Arts, a Diploma of Higher Education marks two-thirds of their undergraduate degree. Thus allowing the British Diploma to rank ahead of the American Associate of Arts (which in American parlance is a two-year undergraduate, or half of a BA/BS). That being said, American universities generally consider UK Diplomas equivalent to a college level Associate of Arts even though a British student typically holds more credit hours (and therefore more study time) in the arts, humanities and/or sciences.

In the United Kingdom, the Diploma is also the academic equivalent of the more vocational [[Higher National Diploma]],&lt;ref name="Directgov"/&gt; awarded following [[further education|further education and training]] courses.

In [[Scotland]], a DipHE is worth 240 [[credit (education)|credit points]] (at least 120 at Level 7 and at least 80 at Level 8) on the [[Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework]]. (As a guide an ordinary degree is worth 360 credit points and an [[Honours degree]] is worth 480 credit points.)

They are accredited by the universities, except in the case of nurse and community and youth work education where the curriculum is prescribed by the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]], students are permitted to use the [[List of post-nominal letters (United Kingdom)|postnominals DipHE after their name]], sometimes followed by the course name in brackets and the University from which they earned their qualification.

Sometimes, having a DipHE can exempt the holder from some of the requirements of a bachelor's degree; for example, it might reduce the length of study or number of courses necessary to complete the qualification. This typically allows a Diploma holder to obtain a BA/BSc in one-third of the time.

Diplomas are generally awarded on a pass/fail basis, and occasionally are awarded with honours when a student has distinguished themself. The two highest honours are Merit and Distinction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5889">Congo is a 342,000-square-kilometer country in [[Equatorial Africa]]. Its population is just over 7 million inhabitants, of which 47% is less than 15 years old. Life expectancy is 55.8 years old for men and 58.9 years for women, and 33% of the population lives in rural areas.

12.6% of the Congolese budget is spent on education; 40% on primary education, 31% on secondary level, and 27% on tertiary level. Only 1% goes to pre-primary education.

Education in Congo takes 13 years, from the first level of Primary School to the Higher Certificate.

According to the 2005 [[UNDP]] report, 66.8% of Congolese are literate.

==Primary Level==
[[File:Young Congolese boys during a lesson at the Mugosi Primary School.jpg|thumb|Congolese boys at the Mugosi Primary School, Kitschoro. [[UNESCO]] (2009)]]
Primary level education in the Republic of the Congo takes six years. The average age at which children arrive at school is 5½ years. Primary school consists of six grades; two preparatory, two elementary, and two medium classes. At the end of the second medium class, the young learner is required to do the Secondary School Entry Test, on which his entry to secondary level is hinged.

==Secondary School==
Secondary school takes seven years. It consists of two parts, the first one being "college", and the second "lycée".

In the republic of the Congo, a [[French-speaking Country|French-speaking country]], the term "college" refers to the first four grades of the Secondary School, including Grades 7, 8, 9 and 10.

The term "lycée" (or lycee) on the other hand refers to the three subsequent grades of Secondary Level, including Grades 11, 12 and 13. There are three kinds of lycées in the country: Agricultural, Technical and General Lycées.

The Agricultural Lycée welcomes students interested in agriculture. At Technical Lycée, students are provided with skills on technological field, including mechanics, engineering and architecture, among others. All other students go to the General Lycée.

Both Agricultural and Technical Lycées welcome students through a special test, whereas the general lycée is open to all who succeed at the [[GCSE]] examination, which occurs at the end of Grade 10.

===The General Lycée===

Upon entering General Lycée, students are asked to choose in Grade 10 which division they want to enter in. In fact, General Lycée consists of two sections with three grades each. Those interested in sciences go to the S division, whereas others go to LE division.

Students in Grade 11LE interested in economics, go to Subdivision B (for Business), while those interested in languages go to Subdivision A2. Those interested in [[human sciences]] enter sub-division A3. Other students go to subdivision A1.

Meanwhile, those in Grade 11S which are interested in biological and/or earth sciences, go to Subdivision D, others interested in physics and mathematics go to Subdivision C.

At Grade 13, every student is required to do the Senior School Higher Certificate Examination, no matter which lycée they are studying in.

==Literacy rate==
The literacy rate in the Republic of the Congo is 82.8 percent. This is defined as people over the age of 15 that possess the skills to read and write.

===List of Higher Education Institutions in Congo-Brazzaville===
* [[Marien Ngouabi University]]
* Christian Polytechnic and Professional Institute of Arts
* Institute of Business and Economical Development
* Mondongo Higher Institute of Agricultural Sciences

===Medical Education in the Republic of Congo===

Education on Medicine takes seven years, during which there is no intermediate degree. It consists of three levels; in the first three years, students are taught on general aspects, including [[anatomy]], [[biochemistry]], [[physiology]], [[molecular biology]] etc. The next level deals with theoretical medicine and [[pharmacy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8059">[[Image:London Business School facade.jpg|thumb|200px|The GSC was founded by MBA students of [[London Business School]] in spring 2006]]
The '''Global Security Challenge''' runs international [[business plan]] competitions to find and select the most promising security technology [[startup company|startup]]s in the world. The GSC holds regional selection events and a Security Summit in London to bring together innovators with government, industry and investors. The GSC belongs to [[InnoCentive]], which acquired the original owner [[OmniCompete]] in 2012. OmniCompete also launched the [[Energy Storage Challenge]] in 2010.

==History==
The GSC was founded by [[MBA]] students of [[London Business School]] in spring 2006; the first  [[competition]] took place in summer 2006. By 2007, the [[Technical Support Working Group]], an interagency group of the US Government, sponsored the annual grant award of $500,000 Dollar for the winning security startup. The GSC runs regional finals in [[Singapore]] at the [[National University of Singapore]], in [[Washington DC]] at [[The University of Maryland]] and [[Brussels]] at the [[Brussels School of International Studies]] ahead of the GSC [[London]] Security Summit in autumn, hosted by [[London Business School]].

==Past Competitions' Winners &amp; Finalists==
GSC finalists and winners from the last three annual competitions have subsequently raised over '''$117 million''' in new [[venture funding]] and grants. The top-selected startups also have secured large contracts with government clients, such as the [[US Department of Energy]], the [[US Navy]] and the [[US Department of Defense]], and with industry behemoths, such as [[Siemens]] and [[Bayer AG]] from Germany. One regional finalist in 2007, [http://www.tencube.com TenCube], recently got acquired by '''McAfee''' and the cyber 2009 winner [[Ksplice]] was acquired in July 2011 by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1742">'''Goodwill Scholarships''' are college-level scholarships created and fully funded starting in 2003 by two private citizens in [[Prince William County]], [[Virginia]], to aid international students who study at the [[Northern Virginia Community College]] (NVCC).

Unlike most other scholarships available to students at American colleges, the Goodwill awards are limited to international students who have a 3.0 academic average and a demonstrated financial need.  However, students being considered for awards do '''not''' need to fill out the [[Free Application for Federal Student Aid]] (FAFSA) form that is commonly required of U.S. citizens.

Normally, two students are recognized annually for these awards.  The scholarship program is administered by the Northern Virginia Community College Educational Foundation, an adjunct to NVCC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6393">'''John Cannizzaro Jr.''' (born 1943), better known as '''John Canemaker''', is an American independent [[animator]], [[animation historian]], author, teacher and lecturer. In 1980, he began teaching and developing the animation program at [[New York University]], [[Tisch School of the Arts]]', Kanbar Institute of Film and Television Department. Since 1988 he has directed the program and is currently a tenured full professor. From 2001-2002 he was Acting Chair of the NYU Undergraduate Film and Television Department. In 2006, his film ''[[The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation]]'', a 28-minute animated piece about Canemaker's relationship with his father, won the Academy Award for best animated short.  In 2007 the same piece picked up an Emmy award for  its graphic and artistic design.

==Biography==
Raised in [[Elmira, New York]], Canemaker began an acting career which included off-Broadway and advertising work in New York City from 1961 to 1965. In 1967, after a two-year stint in the Army, Canemaker, with funds from acting assignments in TV commercials (he appeared in over 35 advertisements for major products, most famously leading a line of "fat kids, skinny kids, kids who climb on rocks" through Central Park for Armour hotdogs)—and appearing as a cast member of the 1972 WCBS-TV show ''[[Patchwork Famil]]y'', in which he drew on a large sketching pad—he obtained his bachelor of arts degree from [[Marymount Manhattan College]] in 1974 and master of fine arts in film from New York University in 1976.

While studying for his bachelor of arts degree, Canemaker's childhood interest in animation revived. He began making sponsored animated shorts and wrote the first of more than 100 articles on animation history. His first book, the story of the making of [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]]' ''[[Raggedy Ann &amp; Andy: A Musical Adventure|Raggedy Ann and Andy]]'', was published in 1977 as ''The Animated Raggedy Ann and Andy''. In 1982, he wrote the introduction of ''Treasures of Disney Animation Art''; in 1987, he published ''Winsor McCay—His Life and Art''; and, in 1991, ''[[Felix the Cat|Felix]], the Twisted Tale of the World's Most Famous Cat.'' There followed ''[[Tex Avery]]: The [[MGM]] Years'' and ''Before the Animation Begins: the Art and Lives of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] Inspirational Sketch Artists'' (both in 1997), ''Paper Dreams: The Art and Artists of Disney Storyboards'' (1999), ''[[Walt Disney]]'s Nine Old men and the Art of Animation'' (2001), and ''The Art and Flair of [[Mary Blair]]'' (2003).

His research in the history of animation inspired two of his own films, ''Remembering [[Winsor McCay]]'' (1976) and ''[[Otto Messmer]] and [[Felix the Cat]]'' (1977).

Canemaker's filmography includes independently made animated shorts that are part of the permanent collection of New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]]. Among them are ''The '40s'' (1974), ''Street Freaks'' (1975), ''Confessions of a Stardreamer'' (1978), ''The Wizard's Son'' (1981), ''Bottom's Dream'' (1983), ''Confessions of a Stand-Up'' (1993), and ''Bridgehampton'' (1998).

In the early 1980s, Canemaker animated several [[Children's Television Workshop]] films for ''[[Sesame Street]]'', TV commercials, and, in 1981, created the animation sequences for the [[Warner Bros.]] feature ''[[The World According to Garp]]''. He designed and directed animation sequences in the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning [[HBO]] documentary ''You Don't Have to Die'' (1988) and the [[Peabody Award]]-winning [[CBS]] documentary ''Break the Silence: Kids Against Child Abuse'' (1994).

''John Canemaker: Marching to a Different Toon'', a DVD/home video collection of his films, is distributed by Milestone Film &amp; Video/Image Entertainment. In addition, Canemaker writes regularly on animation for ''The [[New York Times]]'' and is on-camera and audio commentator on [[DVD]] versions of ''The [[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]] Anthology'', ''[[Dumbo]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'', ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', ''Cut-up: The Films of [[Grant Munro (filmmaker)|Grant Munro]]'', and ''Winsor McCay: The Master Edition''. He has appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]' ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'', and ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', and has lectured throughout the United States and in Brazil, Canada, England, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, and Wales.

In 2006, he received an Award for outstanding contribution to animation studies at the World Festival of Animated Film - [[Animafest Zagreb]].

'''Jumpstart Academy Africa''' is a for impact social venture which utilizes entrepreneurial leadership and mentoring to solve Africa’ human capital problem which starts at the secondary school level.

The founding mission of the Academy is to create a wave of entrepreneurial leaders by pioneering a world class Leadership and Entrepreneurship curriculum.

The Academy was launched in Cameroon in 2014 by Madelle Kangha and has trained over 350 students to date. JumpStart Academy Africa has been featured by Forbes due to their ground breaking work in the space of Education and Youth entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;Ashoka [https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashoka/2015/02/05/how-innovative-young-africans-are-fixing-a-broken-education-system/ "How Innovative Young Africans Are Fixing A Broken Education System"], ''[[Forbes]]'', New Jersey, 2 May 2015. Retrieved on 21 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Madelle Kangha is from Cameroon and earned her college degree at the London School of Economics where she finished degrees in Anthropology and Law. She is the President of this organization. At the African Leadership Academy, Madelle founded a campus student-operated a small food retail outlet, Duka Bora that still exists up to the present time.  She also established a youth and community-based organization known as Youths 4 Change with the goal of making African youngsters advocates of socio-economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africanleadershipacademy.org/profiles/madelle-kangha-cameroon/|title=Madelle Kangha - African Leadership Academy|work=African Leadership Academy|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The co-founder of Jumpstart Academy Africa is Omotola Akinsola from Ibadan in Nigeria. Omotola was among those who received the Who’s Who among American Colleges and Universities Students in 2012. Omotola is also the recipient of the Outstanding Social Work Student of the year (2012). Columbia College of South Carolina in the USA officially accepted Omotola into the Circle of Influence for Student Leaders. She served in the Office of Republican Party Senator John Boozman as Congressional Fellow of Capitol Hill, Washington District of Columbia. Omotola is a candidate for Master (George Warren Brown School of Social Work) at Saint Louis Washington University. She obtained her bachelor's degree major in Social Work from Columbia College.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://watson.lynn.edu/portfolio/omotola-akinsola/|title=Omotola Akinsola - Watson Institute|work=Watson Institute|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumpstart Academy Africa seeks to deal with the human capital dilemma that Africa experiences today. The organization’s strategy is to help nurture youth leaders and entrepreneurs who espouse ethics by means of a global curriculum in leadership and entrepreneurship across various learning institutions. The Academy’s three essential components include a two-year leadership and entrepreneurship training for student so their skills will be improved. The focus will be on employment prospects, enterprise building, civic accountability, and community engagement. It also offers coaching to guide students in the transition from secondary to college environment as well as tutorials for promoting students’ learning outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.i-genius.org/jumpstart-academy-africa/|title=JumpStart Academy Africa {{!}} Global Social Business News|date=2015-03-10|work=i-genius {{!}} Social &amp; Impact Entrepreneur Business &amp; Enterprise|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This interactive strategy of learning as well as the Academy’s program nurtures critical thinking, principled leadership, and an entrepreneurial method of problem-solving along with civic engagement. The approach can help many youth between 14 and 18 years of age to turn out as esteemed contributors in the job market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashoka/2015/02/05/how-innovative-young-africans-are-fixing-a-broken-education-system/#44e955e357f1|title=How Innovative Young Africans Are Fixing A Broken Education System|last=Ashoka|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leon Battista Alberti''' ({{IPA-it|leˈon batˈtista alˈbɛrti|lang}}; February 14, 1404 – April 25, 1472) was an Italian [[Renaissance humanist|humanist]] author, artist, architect, poet, [[Catholic priest|priest]], [[linguistics|linguist]], philosopher and [[cryptography|cryptographer]]; he epitomised the [[Polymath|Renaissance Man]]. Although he is often characterized exclusively as an architect, as James Beck has observed,&lt;ref&gt;James Beck, "Leon Battista Alberti and the 'Night Sky' at San Lorenzo", ''Artibus et Historiae'' '''10''', No. 19 (1989:9–35), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; "to single out one of Leon Battista's 'fields' over others as somehow functionally independent and self-sufficient is of no help at all to any effort to characterize Alberti's extensive explorations in the fine arts."  Although Alberti is known mostly for being an artist, he was also a mathematician of many sorts and made great advances to this field during the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mathematical Works of Leon Battista Alberti |last=Williams |first=Kim |publisher=Birkhauser Verlag AG |date=August 27, 2010 |isbn=978-3-0346-0473-4 |location= |pages=1 |quote= |via=Duke Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberti's life was described in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]].

==Life==
Leon Battista Alberti was born in 1404 in [[Genoa]]. His mother is not known, and his father was a wealthy Florentine who had been exiled from his own city, allowed to return in 1428. Alberti was sent to boarding school in Padua, then studied Law at [[Bologna]].&lt;ref name=MS&gt;Melissa Snell, ''[http://historymedren.about.com/od/awho/a/bio_alberti.htm Leon Battsta Alberti]'', About.com: Medieval History.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived for a time in [[Florence]], then travelled to Rome in 1431 where he took [[holy orders]] and entered the service of the papal court.&lt;ref name=IL/&gt; During this time he studied the [[Ancient Roman architecture|ancient ruins]], which excited his interest in architecture and strongly influenced the form of the buildings that he designed.&lt;ref name=IL&gt;''The Renaissance:a Illustrated Encyclopedia'', Octopus (1979) {{ISBN|0706408578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti was gifted in many ways. He was tall, strong and a fine athlete who could ride the wildest horse and jump over a man's head.&lt;ref name="Renaissance Italy 1860"/&gt; He distinguished himself as a writer while he was still a child at school, and by the age of twenty had written a play which was successfully passed off as a genuine piece of Classical literature.&lt;ref name=MS/&gt; In 1435, he began his first major written work, ''[[De Pictura|Della pittura]],'' which was inspired by the burgeoning pictorial art in Florence in the early 15th century. In this work he analyses the nature of painting and explores the elements of perspective, composition and colour.&lt;ref name=IL/&gt;

In 1438 he began to focus more on architecture and was encouraged by the Marchese [[Leonello d'Este]] of Ferrara, for whom he built a small [[triumphal arch]] to support an equestrian statue of Leonello's father.&lt;ref name=MS/&gt; In 1447 he became the architectural advisor to [[Pope Nicholas V]] and was involved with several projects at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].&lt;ref name=MS/&gt;

His first major architectural commission was in 1446 for the facade of the [[Rucellai Palace]] in Florence. This was followed in 1450 by a commission from [[Sigismondo Malatesta]] to transform the Gothic church of San Francesco in [[Rimini]] into a memorial chapel, the [[Tempio Malatestiano]].&lt;ref name=IL/&gt; In Florence, he designed the upper parts of the facade for the Dominican church of [[Santa Maria Novella]], famously bridging the nave and lower aisles with two ornately inlaid scrolls, solving a visual problem and setting a precedent to be followed by architects of churches for four hundred years.&lt;ref name=AD49&gt;Joseph Rykwert, ed., ''Leon Baptiste Alberti'', Architectul Design, Vol 49 No 5-6, London&lt;/ref&gt; In 1452, he completed  ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'', a treatise on architecture, using as its basis the work of [[Vitruvius]] and influenced by the archaeological remains of Rome. The work was not published until 1485.  It was followed in 1464 by his less influential work, ''De statua'', in which he examines sculpture.&lt;ref name=IL/&gt; Alberti's only known sculpture is a self-portrait medallion, sometimes attributed to [[Pisanello]].
[[File:Palazzo Rucellai.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palazzo Rucellai]]]]
Alberti was employed to design two churches in [[Mantua]], [[San Sebastiano (Mantua)|San Sebastiano]], which was never completed, and for which Alberti's intention can only be speculated, and the [[Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua|Basilica of Sant'Andrea]]. The design for the latter church was completed in 1471, a year before Alberti's death, but was brought to completion and is his most significant work.&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt;

As an artist, Alberti distinguished himself from the ordinary craftsman, educated in workshops. He was a [[humanism|humanist]], and part of the rapidly expanding entourage of intellectuals and artisans supported by the courts of the princes and lords of the time. Alberti, as a member of noble family and as part of the Roman [[curia]], had special status. He was a welcomed guest at the [[House of Este|Este]] court in [[Ferrara]], and in [[Urbino]] he spent part of the hot-weather season with the [[condottieri|soldier-prince]] [[Federico III da Montefeltro]]. The [[Duke of Urbino]] was a shrewd military commander, who generously spent money on the [[patronage]] of art. Alberti planned to dedicate his [[treatise]] on architecture to his friend.&lt;ref name="Renaissance Italy 1860"/&gt;

Among Alberti's smaller studies, pioneering in their field, were a treatise in [[cryptography]], ''[[Alberti cipher|De componendis cifris]]'', and the first Italian [[grammar]]. With the Florentine cosmographer [[Paolo Toscanelli]] he collaborated in astronomy, a close science to geography at that time, and produced a small Latin work on geography, ''Descriptio urbis Romae'' (''The Panorama of the City of Rome''). Just a few years before his death, Alberti completed ''De iciarchia'' (''On Ruling the Household''), a dialogue about Florence during the [[Medici]] rule.

Alberti, having taken holy orders, remained unmarried all his life. He loved animals and had a pet dog, a mongrel, for whom he wrote a [[panegyric]], (''Canis'').&lt;ref name="Renaissance Italy 1860"/&gt; Vasari describes him as "an admirable citizen, a man of culture.... a friend of talented men, open and courteous with everyone. He always lived honourably and like the gentleman he was."&lt;ref name=Vasari&gt;Vasari, ''The Lives of the Artists''&lt;/ref&gt; Alberti died in Rome on April 25, 1472 at the age of 68.

{{further|Mathematics and architecture}}

Alberti regarded mathematics as the common ground of art and the sciences. "To make clear my exposition in writing this brief commentary on painting," Alberti began his treatise, ''Della Pittura'' (On Painting), "I will take first from the mathematicians those things with which my subject is concerned."&lt;ref&gt;Leone Battista Alberti, On Painting, editor John Richard Spencer, 1956, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Della pittura'' (also known in Latin as ''[[De Pictura]]'') relied in its scientific content on classical [[optics]] in determining [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] as a geometric instrument of artistic and architectural representation.  Alberti was well-versed in the sciences of his age. His knowledge of [[optics]] was connected to the handed-down long-standing tradition of the ''Kitab al-manazir'' (''The Optics''; ''De aspectibus'') of the Arab polymath [[Alhazen]] ([[Ibn al-Haytham]], d. c. 1041), which was mediated by Franciscan optical workshops of the 13th-century ''Perspectivae'' traditions of scholars such as [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Peckham]] and [[Witelo]] (similar influences are also traceable in the third commentary of [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], ''Commentario terzo'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], "A Philosophical Perspective on [[Alhazen]]’s [[Optics]]," ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'', vol. 15, issue 2 (2005), pp. 189–218 ([[Cambridge University Press]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Archtitecture of Leon Battista Alberti title page.jpg|thumb|English title page of the first edition of Giacomo Leoni's translation of Alberti's ''De Re Aedificatoria'' (1452). The book is bilingual, with the Italian version being printed on the left and the English version printed on the right.]]
In both ''Della pittura'' and ''De statua'', Alberti stressed that "all steps of learning should be sought from nature."&lt;ref name=kirjasto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/alberti.htm |title=Leon Battista Alberti |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210175324/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/alberti.htm |archivedate=February 10, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate aim of an artist is to imitate nature. Painters and sculptors strive "through by different skills, at the same goal, namely that as nearly as possible the work they have undertaken shall appear to the observer to be similar to the real objects of nature."&lt;ref name=kirjasto/&gt; However, Alberti did not mean that artists should imitate nature objectively, as it is, but the artist should be especially attentive to beauty, "for in painting beauty is as pleasing as it is necessary."&lt;ref name=kirjasto/&gt; The work of art is, according to Alberti, so constructed that it is impossible to take anything away from it or add anything to it, without impairing the beauty of the whole. Beauty was for Alberti "the harmony of all parts in relation to one another," and subsequently "this concord is realized in a particular number, proportion, and arrangement demanded by harmony." Alberti's thoughts on harmony were not new—they could be traced back to Pythagoras—but he set them in a fresh context, which fit in well with the contemporary aesthetic discourse.

In Rome, Alberti had plenty of time to study its ancient sites, ruins, and objects. His detailed observations, included in his ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'' (1452, ''On the Art of Building''),&lt;ref name=DeRe&gt;Alberti, Leon Battista. On ''the Art of Building in Ten Books''. Trans. Leach, N., Rykwert, J., &amp; Tavenor, R. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; were patterned after the ''De architectura'' by the Roman architect and engineer [[Vitruvius]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 46–30 BC). The work was the first architectural treatise of the Renaissance. It covered a wide range of subjects, from history to town planning, and engineering to the philosophy of beauty. ''De re aedificatoria,'' a large and expensive book, was not fully published until 1485, after which it became a major reference for architects.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., [http://www.palladiancenter.org/predecessors.html Palladio's Literary Predecessors]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the book was written "not only for craftsmen but also for anyone interested in the noble arts," as Alberti put it.&lt;ref name=DeRe/&gt; Originally published in Latin, the first Italian edition came out in 1546. and the standard Italian edition by [[Cosimo Bartoli]] was published in 1550. Pope [[Nicholas V]], to whom Alberti dedicated the whole work, dreamed of rebuilding the city of Rome, but he managed to realize only a fragment of his visionary plans. Through his book, Alberti opened up his theories and ideals of the Florentine Renaissance to architects, scholars and others.

Alberti wrote ''I Libri della famiglia''—which discussed education, marriage, household management, and money—in the Tuscan dialect. The work was not printed until 1843. Like [[Erasmus]] decades later, Alberti stressed the need for a reform in education. He noted that "the care of very young children is women's work, for nurses or the mother," and that at the earliest possible age children should be taught the alphabet.&lt;ref name=kirjasto/&gt; With great hopes, he gave the work to his family to read, but in his autobiography Alberti confesses that "he could hardly avoid feeling rage, moreover, when he saw some of his relatives openly ridiculing both the whole work and the author's futile enterprise along it."&lt;ref name=kirjasto/&gt; ''Momus'', written between 1443 and 1450, was a misogynist comedy about the Olympian gods. It has been considered as a [[roman à clef]]—[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] has been identified in some sources as Pope Eugenius IV and Pope Nicholas V. Alberti borrowed many of its characters from [[Lucian]], one of his favorite Greek writers. The name of its hero, Momus, refers to the Greek word for blame or criticism. After being expelled from heaven, [[Momus]], the god of mockery, is eventually castrated. Jupiter and the other gods come down to earth also, but they return to heaven after Jupiter breaks his nose in a great storm.

Alberti did not concern himself with the practicalities of building, and very few of his major works were brought to completion.  As a designer and a student of Vitruvius and of ancient Roman remains, he grasped the nature of column and lintel architecture, from the visual rather than structural viewpoint, and correctly employed the [[Classical orders]], unlike his contemporary, [[Brunelleschi]], who utilised the Classical column and pilaster in a free interpretation. Among Alberti's concerns was the social effect of architecture, and to this end he was very well aware of the cityscape.&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt; This is demonstrated by his inclusion, at the Rucellai Palace, of a continuous bench for seating at the level of the basement.

In Rome he was employed by [[Pope Nicholas V]] for the restoration of the [[Roman aqueduct]] of [[Acqua Vergine]], which [[debouches|debouched]] into a simple basin designed by Alberti, which was swept away later by the Baroque [[Trevi Fountain]].

Some studies&lt;ref&gt;D. Mazzini, S. Simone, ''Villa Medici a Fiesole. Leon Battista Alberti e il prototipo di villa rinascimentale'', Centro Di, Firenze 2004&lt;/ref&gt; propose that the [[Villa Medici in Fiesole]] might owe its design to Alberti, not to Michelozzo, and that it then became the prototype of the [[Renaissance]] [[villa]]. This hilltop dwelling, commissioned by [[Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici|Giovanni de' Medici]], [[Cosimo il Vecchio]]'s second son, with its view over the city, may be the very first example of a Renaissance villa: that is to say it follows the Albertian criteria for rendering a country dwelling a "villa suburbana". Under this perspective the Villa Medici in Fiesole could therefore be considered the "muse" for numerous other buildings, not only in the Florence area, which from the end of the 15th century onwards find inspiration and creative innovation here.

===Tempio Malatestiano, Rimini===
The [[Tempio Malatestiano]] in [[Rimini]] (1447, 1453–60)&lt;ref name=Borsi&gt;Franco Borsi. ''Leon Battista Alberti''. New York: Harper &amp; Row, (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; is the rebuilding of a Gothic church.  The facade, with its dynamic play of forms, was left incomplete.&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt;

===Façade of Palazzo Rucellai===
The design of the façade of the [[Palazzo Rucellai]] (1446–51) was one of several commissions for the Rucellai family.&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt; The design overlays a grid of shallow pilasters and cornices in the Classical manner onto rusticated masonry, and is surmounted by a heavy cornice. The inner courtyard has [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns.  The palace set a standard in the use of Classical elements that is original in civic buildings in Florence, and greatly influenced later palazzi. The work was executed by [[Bernardo Rosselino]].&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt;

===Santa Maria Novella===
At [[Santa Maria Novella]], Florence, between (1448–70)&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt; the upper facade was constructed to the design of Alberti. It was a challenging task, as the lower level already had three doorways and six [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] niches containing tombs and employing the polychrome marble typical of Florentine churches such as [[San Miniato al Monte]] and the [[Baptistery of Florence]]. The design also incorporates an [[rose window|ocular window]] which was already in place. Alberti introduced Classical features around the portico and spread the polychromy over the entire facade in a manner which includes Classical proportions and elements such as pilasters, cornices and a pediment in the Classical style, ornamented with a sunburst in tesserae, rather than sculpture. The best known feature of this typically aisled church is the manner in which Alberti has solved the problem of visually bridging the different levels of the central nave and much lower side aisles. He employed two large scrolls, which were to become a standard feature of Church facades in the later Renaissance, Baroque and Classical Revival buildings.&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt;

===Pienza===
[[File:Pienza Piazza Pio II.JPG|thumb|upright= 1.5|Piazza Pio II in Pienza, looking towards the Palazzo Piccolomini]]
Alberti is considered to have been the consultant for the design of the Piazza Pio II, [[Pienza]]. The village, previously called Corsignano, was redesigned beginning around 1459.&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt; It was the birthplace of Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, [[Pope Pius II]], in whose employ Alberti served.  Pius II wanted to use the village as a retreat but needed for it to reflect the dignity of his position.

The piazza is a [[trapezoid]] shape defined by four buildings, with a focus on Pienza Cathedral and passages on either side opening onto a landscape view. The principal residence, ''Palazzo Piccolomini'', is on the west side. It has three stories, articulated by pilasters and entablature courses, with a twin-lighted [[cross window]] set within each bay. This structure is similar to Alberti's [[Palazzo Rucellai]] in Florence and other later palaces. Noteworthy is the internal court of the palazzo. The back of the palace, to the south, is defined by [[loggia]] on all three floors that overlook an enclosed [[Italian Renaissance garden]] with ''[[Giardino all'italiana]]'' era modifications, and spectacular views into the distant landscape of the [[Val d'Orcia]] and Pope Pius's beloved Mount Amiata beyond.  Below this garden is a vaulted stable that had stalls for 100 horses. The design, which radically transformed the center of the town, included a palace for the pope, a church, a town hall and a building for the bishops who would accompany the Pope on his trips. Pienza is considered an early example of Renaissance urban planning.

===Sant' Andrea, Mantua===
The [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|Basilica of Sant'Andrea]], [[Mantua]] was begun in 1471,&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt; the year before Alberti's death. It was brought to completion and is his most significant work employing the [[triumphal arch]] motif, both for its facade and interior, and influencing many works that were to follow.&lt;ref name= AD49/&gt; Alberti perceived the role of architect as designer. Unlike [[Brunelleschi]], he had no interest in the construction, leaving the practicalities to builders and the oversight to others.&lt;ref name= AD49/&gt;

===Other buildings===

* The Tribune for [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze|Santissima Annunziata]], Florence (1470, completed with alterations, 1477)&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt;

==Painting==
[[Giorgio Vasari]], who argued that historical progress in art reached its peak in [[Michelangelo]], emphasized Alberti's scholarly achievements, not his artistic talents: "He spent his time finding out about the world and studying the proportions of antiquities; but above all, following his natural genius, he concentrated on writing rather than on applied work." &lt;ref name=Vasari/&gt; [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], who ironically called himself "an uneducated person" (''omo senza lettere''), followed Alberti in the view that painting is science. However, as a scientist Leonardo was more empirical than Alberti, who was a theorist and did not have similar interest in practice. Alberti believed in ideal beauty, but Leonardo filled his notebooks with observations on human proportions, page after page, ending with his famous drawing of the [[Vitruvian man]], a human figure related to a square and a circle.

In ''On Painting'', Alberti uses the expression "We Painters", but as a painter, or sculptor, he was a dilettante. "In painting Alberti achieved nothing of any great importance or beauty," wrote Vasari.&lt;ref name=Vasari/&gt; "The very few paintings of his that are extant are far from perfect, but this is not surprising since he devoted himself more to his studies than to draughtsmanship." [[Jacob Burckhardt]] portrayed Alberti in ''The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy'' as a truly universal genius. "And Leonardo Da Vinci was to Alberti as the finisher to the beginner, as the master to the dilettante. Would only that Vasari's work were here supplemented by a description like that of Alberti! The colossal outlines of Leonardo's nature can never be more than dimly and distantly conceived."&lt;ref name="Renaissance Italy 1860"&gt;Jacob Burckhardt in [[s:The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy#Personality|''The Civilization of the Renaissance Italy'', 2.1]], 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti is said to be in Mantegna's great frescoes in the [[Camera degli Sposi]], the older man dressed in dark red clothes, who whispers in the ear of [[Ludovico III Gonzaga|Ludovico Gonzaga]], the ruler of Mantua.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} In Alberti's self-portrait, a large [[plaquette]], he is clothed as a Roman. To the left of his profile is a winged eye. On the reverse side is the question, ''Quid tum?'' (what then), taken from [[Virgil]]'s ''Eclogues'': "So what, if Amyntas is dark? (''quid tum si fuscus Amyntas?'') Violets are black, and hyacinths are black."{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Contributions==
[[File:Tempio malatestiano, ri, facciata, capitello.JPG|thumb|Detail of the facade of [[Tempio Malatestiano]]]]
Alberti made a variety of contributions to several fields:
* Alberti was the creator of a theory called "historia". In his treatise ''[[De pictura]]'' (1435) he explains the theory of the accumulation of people, animals, and buildings, which create harmony amongst each other, and "hold the eye of the learned and unlearned spectator for a long while with a certain sense of pleasure and emotion".  ''[[De pictura]]'' ("On Painting") contained the first scientific study of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. An Italian translation of ''De pictura'' (''Della pittura'') was published in 1436, one year after the original Latin version and addressed [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] in the preface. The Latin version had been dedicated to Alberti's humanist patron, Gianfrancesco Gonzaga of Mantua. He also wrote works on [sculpture], ''[[:it:De statua|De Statua]]''.
* Alberti used his artistic treatises to propound a new humanistic theory of art. He drew on his contacts with early Quattrocento artists such as Brunelleschi, Donatello and Ghiberti to provide a practical handbook for the renaissance artist.
* Alberti wrote an influential work on architecture, ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'', which by the 16th century had been translated into Italian (by Cosimo Bartoli), French, Spanish and English. An English translation was by [[Giacomo Leoni]] in the early 18th century. Newer translations are now available.
* Whilst Alberti's treatises on painting and architecture have been hailed as the founding texts of a new form of art, breaking from the Gothic past, it is impossible to know the extent of their practical impact within his lifetime. His praise of the ''Calumny of Apelles'' led to several attempts to emulate it, including paintings by Botticelli and Signorelli. His stylistic ideals have been put into practice in the works of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Piero della Francesca]] and [[Fra Angelico]]. But how far Alberti was responsible for these innovations and how far he was simply articulating the trends of the artistic movement, with which his practical experience had made him familiar, is impossible to ascertain.
* He was so skilled in [[Latin]] verse that a comedy he wrote in his twentieth year, entitled ''Philodoxius'', would later deceive the younger [[Aldus Manutius]], who edited and published it as the genuine work of 'Lepidus Comicus'.

[[File:Toscana24te.jpg|thumb|The upper storey of [[Santa Maria Novella]]]]
[[File:Santa Maria Novella (Florence) - 0851.jpg|thumb|One of the giant scrolls at Santa Maria Novella]]
* He has been credited with being the author, or alternatively the designer of the [[woodcut]] illustrations, of the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'', a strange [[fantasy]] novel.&lt;ref&gt;Liane Lefaivre, ''Leon Battista Alberti's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili'', Cambridge: MIT Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
* Apart from his treatises on the arts, Alberti also wrote: ''Philodoxus'' ("Lover of Glory", 1424), ''De commodis litterarum atque incommodis'' ("On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Literary Studies", 1429), ''Intercoenales'' ("Table Talk", c. 1429), ''Della famiglia'' ("On the Family", begun 1432) ''Vita S. Potiti'' ("Life of St. Potitus", 1433), ''De iure'' (On Law, 1437), ''Theogenius'' ("The Origin of the Gods", c. 1440), ''Profugorium ab aerumna'' ("Refuge from Mental Anguish",), ''Momus'' (1450) and ''De Iciarchia'' ("On the Prince", 1468). These and other works were translated and printed in Venice by the humanist [[Cosimo Bartoli]] in 1586.
* Alberti was an accomplished [[cryptography|cryptographer]] by the standard of his day, and invented the first [[polyalphabetic cipher]], which is now known as the [[Alberti cipher]], and machine-assisted encryption using his [[Alberti Cipher Disk|Cipher Disk]]. The polyalphabetic cipher was, at least in principle, for it was not properly used for several hundred years, the most significant advance in cryptography since before Julius Caesar's time. Cryptography historian [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] titles him the "Father of Western Cryptography", pointing to three significant advances in the field which can be attributed to Alberti: "the earliest Western exposition of cryptanalysis, the invention of polyalphabetic substitution, and the invention of enciphered code."{{cite book |author=David Kahn |title=The codebreakers: the story of secret writing |publisher=MacMillan |location=New York |year=1967}}
* According to Alberti himself, in a short autobiography written c. 1438 in Latin and in the third person, (many but not all scholars consider this work to be an autobiography) he was capable of "standing with his feet together, and springing over a man's head." The autobiography survives thanks to an 18th-century transcription by [[Antonio Muratori]]. Alberti also claimed that he "excelled in all bodily exercises; could, with feet tied, leap over a standing man; could in the great cathedral, throw a coin far up to ring against the vault; amused himself by taming wild horses and climbing mountains." Needless to say, many in the Renaissance promoted themselves in various ways and Alberti's eagerness to promote his skills should be understood, to some extent, within that framework. (This advice should be followed in reading the above information, some of which originates in this so-called autobiography.)
* Alberti claimed in his "autobiography" to be an accomplished musician and organist, but there is no hard evidence to support this claim. In fact, musical posers were not uncommon in his day (see the lyrics to the song ''Musica Son'', by Francesco Landini, for complaints to this effect.) He held the appointment of canon in the metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Church|church]] of [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], and thus – perhaps – had the leisure to devote himself to this art, but this is only speculation. Vasari also agreed with this.&lt;ref name=Vasari/&gt;
* He was also interested in the drawing of [[map]]s and worked with the [[astronomer]], astrologer, and [[cartographer]] [[Paolo Toscanelli]].
* In terms of Aesthetics Alberti is one of the first defining the work of art as imitation of nature, exactly as a selection of its most beautiful parts: "So let's take from nature what we are going to paint, and from nature we choose the most beautiful and worthy things"&lt;ref&gt;De Pictura, book III: Ergo semper quae picturi sumus, ea a natura sumamus, semperque ex his quaeque pulcherrima et dignissima deligamus.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9727">'''Madonna Studies''' is the study of the work of American pop musician [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] using an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] approach incorporating [[cultural studies]] and media studies. A notable compendium of essays titled ''The Madonna Connection'' was published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Madonna Connection: Representational Politics, Subcultural Identities, and Cultural Theory|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8133-1396-2|website=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Childs|first1=Chris|title=Review: The Madonna Connection.

==History==
Madonna first came to prominence in the mid 1980s, and the discipline did not take long to start up. Robert Miklitsch dates the start of Madonna studies to 1987 and ''Rocking Around The Clock: Music Television, Postmodernism &amp; Consumer Culture'' by [[E. Ann Kaplan]].&lt;ref name="mikinisch101"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miklitsch|first1=Robert|title=From Hegel to Madonna: Towards a General Economy of "Commodity Fetishism"|date=1998|publisher=SUNY Press|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1990s it was the topic of wider media interest, and commentators were already attacking the growing field.&lt;ref name="mikinisch101"/&gt; In 1992, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' reported that "academics are doing a brisk trade in Madonna-ology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orth|first1=Maureen|title=Madonna in Wonderland|journal=Vanity Fair|date=October 1992|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1992/10/madonna199210}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of scholarly articles, ''The Madonna Connection: Representational Politics, Subcultural Identities, and Cultural Theory'' edited by Cathy Schwichtenberg, was published in late 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Caryn|title=The Empress Has No Clothes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/25/books/the-empress-has-no-clothes.html?pagewanted=all|work=New York Times|date=October 25, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The justification the creation of studies and bibliography focused on Madonna and validity that they have is a subject of debate among scholars and academics. These studies analyzed several topics, but mostly Madonna Studies involved in the study of gender, sexuality, and the mass media. One of her advocates is [[Annalee Newitz]] saying that to "the university communities Madonna occupies a definite place in the curriculum of post-[[Western cultures]] in universities worldwide".&lt;ref name="Newitz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bad.eserver.org/issues/1993/09/newitz.html|title=Madonna's Revenge: What Madonna has given to American culture, and culture throughout the world, is not a collection of songs; rather, it is a collection of images.|date=November 1993|accessdate=February 23, 2015|work=[[Bad Subjects]]|publisher=[[EServer.org]]|format=Issue #9|author=[[Annalee Newitz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor and [[media scholar]] [[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]] explained that all [[cultural studies]] focus primarily on finding a hidden meaning within a social aspect&amp;nbsp;—for example, a Madonna video— so it takes a more comprehensive analysis to provide an appropriate context&amp;nbsp;—in this case, on the work of singer—.&lt;ref name="KellnerHammer"&gt;{{harvnb|Rhonda Hammer|Douglas Kellner|2009|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the American psychologist [[Susan Fiske]], noted that "cultural studies about Madonna only analyze texts and how your audience uses the material to relate to the social construction that is Madonna.&lt;ref name="Own"&gt;{{harvnb|David Owen|1997|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; French academic [[Georges Claude Guilbert]], who has written three books about Madonna, said in one of them "is a bit excessive admiration imply that scholars have for Madonna is the result of a common hostility to censorship". Given her constant social provocations, often with political overtones, the novelist [[Andrew O'Hagan]] said that "Madonna is like a heroic opponent of cultural and political authoritarianism of the American "[[The Establishment|establishment]]".&lt;ref name="Georges_Claude"&gt;{{harvnb|Georges Claude Guilbert|2002|pp=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="This type of research is routine.... From an academic point of view, it doesn't seem peculiar to me. Think of it like this: If you're a [[Martian]] trying to figure out what's going on on Earth, Madonna is a blip on the planet...."|source=—Theodore Clevenger, dean of [[Florida State University|FSU's Department of Communication]] talking about "Madonna Studies".&lt;ref name="Orlando"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-01-06/news/9101030989_1_madonna-ciccone-madonna-videos-thesis|title=The Madonna Thesis Is Madonna Just A Well-toned Rock Star, Or Is She Affecting Your View of the World?

Since her debut, are has written several thesis, essays and [[Scientific journal|scientific trials]] encuadrable in various branches of the [[social sciences]]. It was probably in the 1990s when this phenomenon was most critical and began to divide opinions at the used widely the term "Madonna Studies". According to author Robert Miklitsch of the [[State University of New York Press]], this term is a "political-cultural" phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Miklitsch"&gt;{{harvnb|Miklitsch|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the firm ''[[Knight Ridder]]'' published an article on the subject titled ''Madonna even controversial for scholars'', citing comments from several teachers and other personalities.&lt;ref name="GoogleKnight"&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 17, 1991|accessdate=February 10, 2015|title=Madonna even controversial for scholars|work=[[Moscow-Pullman Daily News]]|número=|p=8|issn=1061-8597|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2026&amp;dat=19910117&amp;id=fZMrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=stAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6422,5057021|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Barbara Stewart from ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', said there was a "growing number of "Madonna Studies" in the United States, [where authors] wrote their works for academic journals and conventions". She added that overseas for many "was a laugh hear of Madonna Studies". She continued that "neither this study theme sit well with some students of higher education".&lt;ref name="Orlando"/&gt; Beyond all this, organizations like the set of liberal arts colleges [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|7 sisters]] teach courses that examine [[Cultural impact of Madonna|the influence of Madonna in culture]].&lt;ref name="Quien"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quien.com/espectaculos/2012/02/06/su-majestad-camaleonica-madonna|title=Su majestad camaleónica: Madonna|date=February 16, 2012|accessdate=February 10, 2015|work=Quien Magazine|publisher=[[CNN Expansión|Revista Expansión]]|author=Eduardo Gutiérrez Segura|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203021938/http://www.quien.com/espectaculos/2012/02/06/su-majestad-camaleonica-madonna|archivedate=December 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, the French scholar [[Georges Claude Guilbert]] wrote in the book ''[[Madonna as Postmodern Myth]]'' (2002), [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[UCLA]], the [[University of Colorado]] and [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] were the first to propose courses "about" Madonna. He added that even at the [[University of Amsterdam]] was created the elective academic discipline, ''Madonna: The Music and the Phenomenon'', within the Department of [[Musicology]].&lt;ref name="GuilbertHarv"&gt;{{harvnb|Georges Claude Guilbert|2002|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There is debate about whether Madonna should have a place in curriculums alongside more established and canonical subjects. [[Roger Kimball]] described it as "a waste of time and money", while others have defended the importance of studying modern culture. Others like [[Camille Paglia]] take a middle ground, saying "We do not need a whole course in Madonna, but within a big course like mine, it is absolutely legitimate to show how images of the present inherit the meanings of the past."&lt;ref name=rollingstone&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/mastering-madonna-19920917 Mastering Madonna], Rolling Stone&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been criticised for adding nothing to students' employment prospects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/879953.stm Are some degree courses a joke?], BBC, 22 August 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mutual monogamy''' is a form of [[monogamy]] that exists when two partners agree to be [[Human sexual activity|sexually active]] with only one another. Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship reduces the risk of acquiring a [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/features/girlfriendshealth/index.html|title=Girlfriends' Health|date=22 April 2017|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most reliable ways to avoid STIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/final-evidence-review40/gonorrhea-screening|title=Final Evidence Review: Gonorrhea: Screening - US Preventive Services Task Force|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Home/GetFile/1/1703/sties114final/pdf|title=Evidence Synthesis Number 114, Behavioral Sexual Risk Reduction Counseling in Primary Care to Prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections: An Updated Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|date=September 2014|publisher=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/PID/STDFact-PID.htm|title=Pelvic Inflammatory Disease - CDC Fact Sheet|date=2017-10-04|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who choose mutual monogamy can be tested before the sexual relationship to be certain they are not infected.  This strategy for the prevention of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection requires that each partner remain [[Faithfulness|faithful]] and does not engage in sexual activity with another partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2005/many-men-choose-monogamy-prevent-sexually-transmitted-diseases|title=Many Men Choose Monogamy To Prevent Sexually Transmitted Diseases|date=22 September 2005|publisher=Guttmacher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutual monogamy differs from serial monogamy which is a current monogamous relationship that has not been established in the past and may not continue into the future. Serial monogamy may not result in the reduced risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection because the past sexual exposures to infection are brought into the new relationship, even though it may be exclusive of other sexual partners. The risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection while in a serial monogamous relationship is the same as the risk of those who have concurrent partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdD4RS0DqUYC&amp;pg=PT491&amp;lpg=PT491&amp;dq=Mutual+Monogamy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZpebpEnuXs&amp;sig=Q_wrDZWWE1mACFYlvJYYZ6XZoqw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLiYrZ6IbYAhUE8IMKHRzHBQ84ChDoAQhKMAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Mutual+Monogamy&amp;f=false|title=Preventive Dermatology|first=Robert A.|last=Norman|date=25 June 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with a greater ability to communicate about their commitment are likely to sustain the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=One love: explicit monogamy agreements among heterosexual young adult couples at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections|first1=Jocelyn T.|last1=Warren|first2=S.

When individuals are mutually monogamous, and are free from STIs/[[HIV]] when they enter the relationship, the risk for being infected with STI/HIV acquisition from sexual intercourse is very low.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Romantic Relationship Dynamics of Urban African American Adolescents: Patterns of Monogamy, Commitment, and Trust|first1=Senna L.|last1=Towner|first2=M. Margaret|last2=Dolcini|first3=Gary W.|last3=Harper|date=1 May 2015|journal=Youth &amp; Society|volume=47|issue=3|pages=343–373|doi=10.1177/0044118X12462591|pmid=26691404|pmc=4681523}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mutually monogomous relationship lowers the risk of HIV, [[Cervicitis|cervicitis]], and other sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/cervicitis.page|title=Cervicitis|publisher=New York City Health Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mutual monogomous sexual relationship often includes a pledge to stay with the partner and includes the desire for the relationship to last, a psychological attachment and the lack of being able to find another partner. If these conditions remain a priority for both, the "couple is likely committed and mutually monogamous."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and has negative STI test lowers the chance of acquiring [[gonorrhea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/sexually-transmitted-infections/gonorrhea/index.html|title=Gonorrhea|date=17 August 2016|publisher=Health and Human Services }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also effective for lowering the risk of [[syphilis]], [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and [[Crab louse|pubic lice]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.pa.gov/My%20Health/Diseases%20and%20Conditions/Q-T/14242L/Pages/557969.aspx#.WjEVQ0qnE2w&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/sexually-transmitted-infections/syphilis/index.html|title=Syphilis|date=17 August 2016|publisher=Health and Human Services}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/sexually-transmitted-infections/chlamydia/index.html|title=Chlamydia|date=17 August 2016|publisher=Health and Human Services}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/crabs|title=Crabs - IDPH|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dph.illinois.gov|publisher=Illinois Department of Health|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of a more precise definition of mutual monogamy in the literature confounds the ability to statistically assess its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is monogamy or committed relationship status a marker for low sexual risk among men in substance abuse treatment?

'''NASIG''' (formerly, the '''North American Serials Interest Group, Inc.''') is an independent [[professional association]] of [[librarian]]s and [[academic publishing]] professionals, working to advance and transform the management of information resources in all formats and business models, with an emphasis on [[scholarly communication]]s, [[serial (publishing)|serials]] and [[electronic resource management|electronic resources]]. Founded in 1985, NASIG is registered in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] as a [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]].

==History==
The North American Serials Interest Group was founded in 1985 after a group of sixteen American librarians attended the 1984 [[UKSG]] (United Kingdom Serials Group) conference. One of those librarians, John Riddick from [[Central Michigan University]], took the initiative to form a study group to investigate the feasibility of a North American counterpart. Riddick recruited Becky Lenzini from Faxon to work with him to market the concept of NASIG. They conducted a survey of interest and, in July 1985 held a well-attended and enthusiastic general information at the [[American Library Association]] conference in Chicago. Following this meeting, a site selection committee chose [[Bryn Mawr College]] to be the site of NASIG’s inaugural conference. An ad-hoc Executive Council was formed in late 1985 to provide temporary structure until the passage of bylaws and elections held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Jan. 1986"|url = http://tigerprints.clemson.edu/nasig/vol1/iss1/1/|website = tigerprints.clemson.edu|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Special Issue - Annual Conference 1995"|url = http://tigerprints.clemson.edu/nasig/vol10/iss6/1/|website = tigerprints.clemson.edu|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1986, the group published its first issue of the ''NASIG Newsletter''. The first elections were held in November 1986 and the bylaws were approved that same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASIG Chronology|url=http://www.nasig.org/site_page.cfm?pk_association_webpage_menu=731&amp;pk_association_webpage=1211|website=nasig.org|publisher=NASIG|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASIG was incorporated in January 1988 in the State of New York as a non-profit organization under the name North American Serials Interest Group. Over time, the scope of NASIG expanded beyond serials to include all forms of electronic materials as continuing resources, and more recently, scholarly communications, including libraries as publishers and management of institutional repositories. In 2015, the membership elected to change the name to NASIG, and the legal name change in New York went through the same year.

In 2014, after the death of Birdie MacLennan, NASIG became the new home for the SERIALST [[Electronic mailing list|listserv]]. MacLennan worked at the [[University of Vermont]], which had hosted the listserv for over twenty years. After MacLennan passed, the remaining moderators sought a new home for the list—preferably one that was not tied to an individual’s employment—and with its historical focus on serials, NASIG was a good fit.

NASIG’s physical archives have been hosted at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NASIG|url = http://www.nasig.org/site_page.cfm?pk_association_webpage_menu=731&amp;pk_association_webpage=1211|website = www.nasig.org|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference==
The North American Serials Interest Group held its first annual conference in June 1986 at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]]. The NASIG conference has been held every year since in various locations in the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conference Archives|url=http://www.nasig.org/site_page.cfm?pk_association_webpage_menu=700&amp;pk_association_webpage=1301|website=nasig.org|publisher=NASIG|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conferences are usually held in May or June, and have evolved from a focus on print serials to electronic journals to e-resources in general, more recently moving into scholarly communications. Originally, conferences were held on college campuses, with attendees staying in dormitories. The 2003 conference at Portland State University was the first conference with attendees staying in hotels, and all conference sessions were held on campus. In 2004, NASIG transitioned to housing the full conference in a hotel setting.

==Publications==
NASIG’s annual conference [[proceedings]] are published in the ''Serials Librarian'' ([[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] 0361-526X) as a double issue each year, with the conference presentation files available on SlideShare. In addition to the proceedings, NASIG publishes ''NASIG Newsletter'' (ISSN 1542-3417) on a quarterly basis. NASIG produces a variety of online material, including one blog with job announcements, another with news and announcements, and ''NASIGuides'', short summaries of best practices and industry topics written by NASIG members.

==Professional Development==
NASIG works independently and in partnership with other organizations to provide professional development to members, students, and other professionals in the publishing industry and library community.

Four times per year, and sometimes in conjunction with [[National Information Standards Organization]] (NISO), NASIG hosts webinars on a variety of information resource management topics such as [[List of book distributors|vendor]] negotiations, [[integrated library system]]s, [[FRBR]], [[linked data]], and the [[serials crisis]].

NASIG created a task force—now called the Student Outreach Committee—to work with [[Master of Library and Information Science|library and information science programs]] accredited by the [[American Library Association]]. Serials is often not a topic of focus in many such programs, so NASIG created this sub-group to recruit and encourage future serials librarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Bradley A.|title=Educating the Next Generation of Serialists|journal=Journal of Electronic Resources in Medical Libraries|date=13 December 2006|volume=3|issue=4|pages=59–64|doi=10.1300/J383v03n04_05|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J383v03n04_05|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASIG continues to supplement traditional librarian education with cutting-edge topics through its conference and [[Web conferencing|webinars]], in the areas of scholarly communication, serials, and electronic resources.

NASIG annually confers numerous [[award]]s for professionals, paraprofessionals, and students within North America in order to assist with funding for attendance to the NASIG Annual Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASIG Awards|url=http://www.nasig.org/site_page.cfm?pk_association_webpage_menu=308&amp;pk_association_webpage=1178|website=NASIG|publisher=NASIG|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the annual conference and webinars, NASIG also sponsors local conferences that relate to its mission.

===Core Competencies for Electronic Resources Librarians===
As the primary professional organization for serials and electronic resource librarians, NASIG has developed and published the Core Competencies for Electronic Resources Librarians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Core Competencies for Electronic Resources Librarians|url=http://www.nasig.org/site_page.cfm?pk_association_webpage_menu=310&amp;pk_association_webpage=1225|website=NASIG|publisher=NASIG|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that provides a basis both for creating job descriptions in serials and electronic resources and for creating library school curricula. They can also be used to define qualities needed by staff working with electronic resources, as a guide to train new and existing staff (in the case of a library-wide re-organization, for example), and to educate all library staff about the specialized skills needed to work with electronic resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Clint|last2=Reece|first2=Derek|title=Library Reorganization, Chaos, and Using the Core Competencies as a Guide|journal=The Serials Librarian|date=2 May 2014|volume=66|issue=1–4|pages=248–252|doi=10.1080/0361526X.2014.881162|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2014.881162|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core competencies were created in part by analyzing job advertisements for professional librarian positions and are based on the occurrence of specific descriptors in the responsibilities and qualifications sections of these job advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hartnett|first1=Eric|title=NASIG's Core Competencies for Electronic Resources Librarians Revisited: An Analysis of Job Advertisement Trends, 2000–2012|journal=The Journal of Academic Librarianship|date=May 2014|volume=40|issue=3–4|pages=247–258|doi=10.1016/j.acalib.2014.03.013|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2014.03.013|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The core competencies focus and expand upon seven core elements: Life Cycle of E-Resources, Technology, Research and Assessment, Effective Communication, Supervising and Management, Trends and Professional Development, and Personal Qualities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASIG Core Competencies for Electronic Resources Librarians|url=http://www.nasig.org/uploaded_files/92/files/CoreComp/CompetenciesforERLibrarians_final_ver_2013-7-22.docx|website=NASIG|publisher=NASIG Executive Board|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASIG has also published Core Competencies for Print Serials Management, which came out of discussions about competencies for electronic resources and serials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nasig.org/uploaded_files/92/files/CoreComp/CompetenciesforPrintManagement_final_ver_2015-5-30.pdf|title = NASIG Core Competencies for Print Serials Management|date = |access-date = 14 January 2016|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New York State Teachers Association''' (NYSTA) was an association of teachers in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], United States, founded in 1845. It assisted teachers in their professional career, provided a public voice for its members on subjects such as pay and tenure, and promoted improvements to the public school system in the state. In 1973 it joined with the [[United Teachers of New York]] to form the [[New York State United Teachers]].

==Foundation==
[[File:Chester Dewey by Powelson, 1865.jpg|thumb|[[Chester Dewey]], first President]]
The New York State Teachers Association was organized at a teacher's convention on 30 July 1845 in [[Syracuse, New York]].{{sfn|Kirk|1883|p=16}}
After the convention had resolved itself into a State Teachers' Association a committee was set up to recommend officers, which decided on [[Chester Dewey]] (1784–1869) of Rochester as President.{{sfn|Kirk|1883|p=17}}
The association was incorporated by a legislative act in 1852.{{sfn|Kirk|1883|p=2}}
It included most of the teachers in upstate New York and [[Long Island]].{{sfn|Gaffney|2012|p=219}}
This was a period when free schools were being established throughout the state, and normal schools were being established to train teachers.{{sfn|Kirk|1883|p=11ff}}
The objectives of the association were to support professional improvement of the member teachers and to promote a series of improvements to the public schools in the state.{{sfn|Congdon|1946|p=388}}

==History==

Samuel Buell Woolworth, principal of the [[Cortland Academy]] in [[Homer, New York]], was NYSTA president in 1948–49.
He was a strong supporter of coeducation.{{sfn|Sweeney|2011|p=16}}
At first women did not have the right to speak at NYSTA meetings, and women teachers were paid much less than men.
Thanks to efforts of teachers such as [[Susan B. Anthony]] in the 1850s they were eventually admitted as full members.{{sfn|Clifford|2014|p=297}}
[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] drafted Anthony's speech on coeducation for the June 1856 NYSTA meeting.{{sfn|Dearstyne|2015|p=73}}

In the late 19th century both state officials and the NYSTA were increasingly concerned about the tendency of local school districts to give teaching certificates to unqualified candidates. In 1887 the NYSTA members lobbied for a bill requiring a standard examination for all teachers in the state. The governor vetoed the bill, but most districts agreed voluntarily to the examination. [[New York City]] was among those who did not.{{sfn|Collins|2015|loc=PT92}}
Mary Evelyn Hall (1874–1956) became the first president of the NYSTA Library Section in 1910–11, and promoted school libraries in the state. 
She became president of the NEA Library Department Committee on High School Libraries in 1911.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=86}}

For most of its history the NYSTA was the New York affiliate of the [[National Education Association]] (NEA).{{sfn|Gaffney|2012|p=219}}
Teachers could enhance their professional careers through membership in NYSTA, and often remained involved after retirement.{{sfn|About Us – NYSRTA}}
From 1913 the NYSTA House of Delegates represented the interests of active teachers.
The New York State Teachers’ Retirement System was established in 1921.{{sfn|About Us – NYSRTA}}
From September 1936 the association started to mail out mimeographed circulars to teachers on subjects such as "Tax Reduction versus Tax Limitation," "Why Tenure for Public School Teachers?" "Academic Freedom-Study Outline," "Credit for School Teachers," "Insurance for School Teachers," and "Federal Aid."{{sfn|H. H.|1937|p=57}}
In 1937 the NYSTA and the School Boards Association founded the New York State Educational Conference Board, which included most of the larger associations of teachers, administrators and parents. The Conference Board developed and promoted proposals to the New York State legislature for increased state funding of schools.{{sfn|Berke|Goertz|Coley|1985|p=75}}

In 1938 it was proposed to add a statement to the section on freedom of speech in the [[New York Constitution]] that would explicitly prevent censorship of radio, cinema and other media, although abuse of the right could be prosecuted. The NYSTA and other educational organizations such as the State Education Department and Associated Principals wrote to the Bill of Rights Committee on the subject, but neither supported or opposed the amendment, which was dropped.{{sfn|Meyer|Agata|Agata|2013|p=230}}

By 1946 the NYSTA had a permanent staff, and owned and partly occupied a modern office building.
The annual meetings drew many attendees. Achievements of the association included obtaining sufficient state funding for teacher training and public education, having teachers licensed by trained officials, job security through teachers' tenure of position, minimum salaries and rural school consolidation.{{sfn|Congdon|1946|p=389}}
On 18 November 1951 the first officers were elected to the New York State Retired Teachers’ Association (NYSRTA), which represented the interest of retired teachers.{{sfn|About Us – NYSRTA}}

==Merger==

In 1973 the NYSTA merged with the United Teachers of New York (UTNY).{{sfn|Gaffney|2012|p=215}}
At the time of the merger the NYSTA had 101,000 members, while the UTNY had 85,000.{{sfn|Kahlenberg|2009|p=142}}
The NEA-affiliated NYSTA was strong in the upstate, suburban and rural areas, while the UTNY represented teachers downstate and in core of New York City.{{sfn|Kahlenberg|2009|p=143}}
The UTNY was an affiliate of the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT).{{sfn|Kahlenberg|2009|p=142}}
[[Albert Shanker]], president of the UTNY, was hoping to merge the national NEA and AFT unions. He said, "If we could merge in New York State, we could start a wave that would flow throughout the country and mergers would occur in other states, like Michigan and Illinois and California."{{sfn|Kahlenberg|2009|p=142}}

The merger was approved by an overwhelming majority of UTNY members and a solid majority of NYSTA teachers.
One of the key issues had been whether the new union should be associated with the [[AFL–CIO]], which the NEA opposed.
The merger agreement announced in April 1972 included AFL–CIO membership.{{sfn|Kahlenberg|2009|p=143}}
Thomas Y. Hobart Jr., who had been elected president of NYSTA in 1971, became the president of combined union.{{sfn|Gaffney|2012|p=223}}
Shanker was elected executive vice-president, but was generally thought to be the more powerful of the two.{{sfn|Kahlenberg|2009|p=143}}
The merged organization was at first called the New York Congress of Teachers, and later changed its name to the [[New York State United Teachers]] (NYSUT).{{sfn|Kahlenberg|2009|p=143}}

The '''Oman Children's Museum''' is a children's [[science museum]], located near Qurum Nature Park off [[Sultan Qaboos Street]] in a white-domed building in [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Oman]].

The museum was established by the Ministry of National Heritage and Culture and opened on November 17, 1990 by Sultan [[Qaboos bin Said al Said]] on the 20th National Day celebration in Oman. The museum has 45 exhibits and two demonstrations and comprises {{convert|10000|sqft|m2}}. It was the first science museum in Oman and is visited by around 50,000 visitors annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontariosciencecentre.ca/sales/portfolio/oman.asp|title=Oman Children's Museum|publisher=Ontario Science Centre|accessdate=January 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wonder world"&gt; {{cite web|url=

&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is currently run by a former school teacher, Samirah Ahmed al Raisi, who has run the museum for over six years.

The museum addresses the scientific ways of human life and the exhibition section is divided into three parts; The Human life, Physics and observation which investigates the progression of science through the ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/oman/muscat-museums/index.html|title=Muscat Museums|publisher=Asiarooms.com|accessdate=January 18, 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has many hands-on displays. These include experiences of a fake [[electric shock]], trigger a [[lightning discharge|lightning bolt]], launching a [[hot air balloon]], photographing your own shadow, and sending message through a whisper dish.&lt;ref name="Wonder world"/&gt;  There is also a display named "Eye Spy", which is series of perception panels with illusions designed to offer some insight into how your eyes and brain see things differently.&lt;ref name="Wonder world"/&gt;

The '''POISK Centre''' (in [[Russian language|Russian]]:''Центр «ПОИСК»'') is an educational and research organization founded in 2004 at [[Saint Petersburg State University]] ([[Russia]]). Its primary aim is to encourage secondary school students and university students to do independent [[scientific research]].

The POISK Centre supports educational programs that motivate youth to develop an interest in [[physics]] and [[natural sciences]], and to involve them in “what a real scientist does” as early as possible. These activities include tight collaboration with leading universities and secondary schools in Russia and abroad, joint seminars and workshops, regular international scientific conferences, language programs, but also the promotion of research competitions, such as the [[International Young Physicists' Tournament|Young Physicists' Tournament]].

POISK means ‘search’ in [[Russian language|Russian]], but it is also a Russian abbreviation for the Support Centre for Olympiads and Intellectual Competitions.

== Achievements ==

Since 2004, the POISK Centre is the only university-based organization in Russia that is being selecting, supervising and preparing the National team that represents Russia at the [[International Young Physicists' Tournament]].

The POISK Centre’s team has been a participant of [[International Young Physicists' Tournament|IYPTs]] in 2004 ([[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]), 2005 ([[Winterthur]], [[Switzerland]]) and 2006 ([[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]) with significant success, winning bronze medals twice. In May 2007, the POISK’s Russian team fought in the Finals and won silver at the [[Austrian Young Physicists' Tournament]] held in [[Leoben]], [[Austria]].

In November 2007, the POISK's team of university students was one of the two gold winners at the [[Ukrainian Physicists' Tournament for University Students]] held at the [[Kiev National University]], [[Ukraine]].

A '''recitation''' in a general sense is the act of [[narrative|reciting]] from memory, or a formal [[Poetry reading|reading of verse]] or other writing before an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/recitation|title=recitation|website=CollinsDictionary.com|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|edition=11th|accessdate=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Recitation|dictionary=[[Collins COBUILD Advanced Dictionary]]|edition=New Digital|date=2008|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic recitation ==
[[File:Pronunciation of Latin (Text).ogg|thumb|[[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Bellum Gallicum]]'' 1,1, spoken by a German, exaggerated to hear the stressed syllables.]]

In [[academia]], recitation is a presentation made by a student to demonstrate knowledge of a subject or to provide instruction to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ucat.osu.edu/bookshelf/teaching-topics/planning-a-class-session/leading-recitation/|title=Leading Recitation - UCAT|website=ucat.osu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[academic institution]]s the term is used for a presentation by a [[teaching assistant]] or instructor, under the guidance of a senior [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] member, that supplements course materials. In recitations that supplement lectures, the leader will often review the lecture, expand on the concepts, and carry on a discussion with the [[student]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uaap.mit.edu/tutoring-support/study-tips/maximizing-lectures-recitation/optimizing-recitations|title=Optimizing Recitations {{!}} MIT Office of Undergraduate Advising and Academic Programming|website=uaap.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2015/09/recitations-a-balancing-act-for-students-and-professors|title=Recitations are a balancing act for students and professors|last=Schaedel|first=Sydney|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its most basic form, a student would recite verbatim poems or essays of others,&lt;ref&gt;Pierpont, John (1832) "Preface" ''The American first class book, or, Exercises in reading and recitation'' Carter, Hendee &amp; Co., Boston, Massachusetts, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9noSAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3 pages 3-6] {{OCLC|12151137}}&lt;/ref&gt; either to the teacher or tutor directly, or in front of a class or body of assembled students.

In classes involving [[mathematics]] and [[engineering]], a recitation is often used as the vehicle to perform derivations or solve problems similar to those assigned to the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2014/12/27/the-advantage-of-recitations-in-large-lecture-courses/|title=The Advantages of Recitations in Large Lecture Courses|website=danieltakeshi.github.io|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific classes, such as biology, chemistry, and physics, often employ the use of recitation sections to help students clarify subject matter that was either not fully understood or inadequately addressed in the limited time of lecture. These recitation sections may be conducted by the professor or a student teaching assistant. These sections provide students with an opportunity to receive additional instruction on confusing subject matter or receive personal assistance with problems or questions assigned as homework in the lecture section&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aschonors.osu.edu/preorient/au-preview-2014/classroom/courses-and-time|title=College Courses and Time Management|date=2015-04-09|work=ASC Honors|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some universities may require attendance at regularly scheduled recitation sections in addition to any required labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://advising.unc.edu/for-families/courses-and-schedules/registration/|title=Registration - Academic Advising Program|work=Academic Advising Program|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recitations may also provide students with additional opportunities for receiving grades for the lecture portion of the course. Despite mandatory attendance and additional time spent in the classroom, these sections usually do not count towards university credits required for graduation, but may significantly increase a student's ability to understand important concepts required to pass the course.

== Religious recitation ==
Recitations of holy texts are part of the cultural presentations of some religions.&lt;ref&gt;Kuipers, Cornelius (1944) "Preface" ''Christian dialogs and recitations: dialogs, recitations, readings, pageants'' Zondervan, Grand Rapids, Michigan, page 1 and following, {{OCLC|9054621}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denny"&gt;Denny, Frederick Mathewson (1989) [http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/4i-ii/2_Denny.pdf "''Qur’ān'' Recitation: A Tradition of Oral Performance and Transmission"] ''Oral Tradition'' 4(1/2): pp. 5-26, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; As Denny notes, "There is a vast bibliography of Qur'an recitation in Arabic and other languages by Muslim scholars."&lt;ref name="Denny" /&gt; These religion recitations take the form of prayer,&lt;ref&gt;Weil, Simone (1942) "Spiritual Autobiography" as "Encounters with Christ" [https://books.google.com/books?id=rKkJs-KHCakC&amp;pg=PA247 page 247] ''In'' [[Bernard McGinn (theologian)|McGinn, Bernard]] (2006) ''The essential writings of Christian mysticism'' Modern Library, New York,
pp. 246-250, {{ISBN|0-8129-7421-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; liturgy, and public performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Martin|first=Richard|date=2005|title=Tilāwah|editor=Jones, Linsay|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|edition=2nd|volume=13|page=9200|publisher=Macmillan Reference|location=[[Detroit]]|isbn=0-02-865982-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recitation as a performing art ==
Recitation is practiced as a performing art especially in Bangladesh and India. Nowadays it is a popular art form in Bengal. The reciters recite Bengali poems on stage and electronic media. Shambhu Mitra, Kazi Sabyasachi, Pradeep Ghosh, Partha Ghhosh, Gauri Ghosh, Utpal Kundu are great reciters from West Bengal. Reciters like Samiran Sanyal, [[Bratati Bandyopadhyay]], Bijoylakshmi Burman, [[Pinaki Chattopadhyay]] to name a few, are contributing significantly in this field. There are many such organizations of recitation, with most located in Bangladesh.

It was often popular for a poet to recite his or her newly-created poetry to an audience. In the early twentieth century, recitation developed into an autonomous art form.

'''Rustication''' is a term used at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Durham University|Durham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=General Regulation IV - Discipline|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/university.calendar/volumei/general_regulations/discipline/|publisher=[[Durham University]]|accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universities to mean being "sent down" or [[Expulsion (academia)|expelled]] temporarily, or, in more recent times, to leave temporarily for welfare and/or health reasons.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The term derives from the Latin word ''rus'', countryside, to indicate that a student has been sent back to his or her family in the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-test.net/gre/vocabulary/words/080/gre-definitions.php |title=Definition of rusticate, parry, amplify, mutter |publisher=English-test.net |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from medieval Latin ''rustici'', meaning "heathens or barbarians" (''missus in rusticos'', "sent among ..."). Depending on the conditions given, a student who has been rusticated may not be allowed to enter any of the university buildings, or even travel to within a certain distance of them. The related term ''[[bannimus]]'' implies a permanent, publicly announced expulsion.

The term is used in British [[Public school (UK)|public schools]] (private schools), and was used in the United States during the 19th century, though it has been superseded by the term "suspension".

==Use in the United Kingdom==
Notable Britons who were rusticated during their time at University include:
*[[John Lyly]] (c. 1553–1606), author of ''[[Euphues]]''. Rusticated from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]  for unknown reasons. 
* [[John Milton]] (1609–1674), rusticated from [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] in 1626 for quarreling with his tutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Ma-Mo/Milton-John.html |title=John Milton Biography - life, family, children, story, death, history, wife, school, young, son, information, born |publisher=Notablebiographies.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Dryden]] (1631–1700), rusticated from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/1/4/8/11488/11488.txt |title=The Poetical Works of John Dryden, Volume 1 by John Dryden - Free Ebook |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2004-03-01 |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exchanged insults with his college vice-master.
* [[Walter Savage Landor]] (1775–1864), rusticated from [[Trinity College, Oxford]] in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/cntjl10.txt |title=Count Julian by Walter Savage Landor - Free Ebook |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2003-05-01 |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landor had fired a gun at the window of a fellow student whose late night revelry had disturbed him and for whom he had an aversion. Landor chose not to return.
* [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] (1792–1822), rusticated from [[University College, Oxford]] in 1811 for writing "[[The Necessity of Atheism]]" and then disseminating the pamphlet to the heads of all [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges at the University]]. Shelley had originally been sent down (permanently expelled), but upon a supplication from his father to the University was given a chance to deny authorship and return.  Shelley refused to deny authorship and was therefore sent down.
* [[Richard Francis Burton]] (1821–1890), rusticated from [[Trinity College, Oxford]] in 1842 for challenging a fellow student to a [[duel]], the latter having mocked the shape of Burton's moustache. 
* [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] (1837–1909), rusticated from [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in 1859&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=617493 |title=Algernon Charles Swinburne |publisher=Everything2.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=source cites wikipedia|date=December 2015}} for having publicly supported the attempted [[assassination]] of [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] by [[Felice Orsini|Orsini]].
* [[Oscar Wilde]] (1854–1900), rusticated from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] after having returned to his college some three weeks after a new term had begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/poets/oscar_wilde.html |title=Oscar Wilde |publisher=Biography online |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Auberon Waugh]] (1939–2001), rusticated from [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1957.  Waugh failed to perform sufficiently well to pass his [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] prelim exams.  Waugh chose not to return.
*[[Mark Boxer]] (1931–1988), rusticated in the 1950s from [[King's College, Cambridge]], as editor of ''[[Granta]]'', the student magazine, when it published a poem deemed by the authorities to be blasphemous.

==Use in the United States==
"The penalty for plagiarism at [[Harvard Extension School|Harvard Extension]] is a failing grade in the course and rustication from the university for at least one calendar year" (noted on a course syllabus in 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic515075.files/121syl-09.doc] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also was used in the United States in the 19th century, and on occasion, later. [[Mark Twain]] and [[Charles Dudley Warner]], in ''[[The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today|The Gilded Age]]'', have a character explain the term:

{{quote|"Philip used to come to Fallkill often while he was in college.  He was once rusticated here for a term."

"Rusticated?"

"Suspended for some College scrape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/5820/5820.txt |title=The Gilded Age, Part 3. by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner - Free Ebook |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2004-06-20 |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a story in the August 1858 ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10626/10626-h/10626-h.htm |title=The Atlantic Monthly, Volume 02, No. 10, August, 1858 by Various - Free Ebook |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a character reminisces:

{{quote|"It was long before you were born, my dear, that, for some college peccadilloes,—it is so long ago that I have almost forgotten now what they were,—I was suspended (rusticated we called it) for a term, and advised by the grave and dignified president to spend my time in repenting and in keeping up with my class. I had no mind to come home; I had no wish, by my presence, to keep the memory of my misdemeanors before my father's mind for six months; so I asked and gained leave to spend the summer in a little town in Western Massachusetts, where, as I said, I should have nothing to tempt me from my studies."}}&lt;!-- retain quotation marks - a character speaking in a story --&gt;

Kevin Starr&lt;ref&gt;[http://print.google.com/print?hl=en&amp;id=vpMI4z-tDPMC&amp;dq=kevin+starr+rusticated&amp;prev=http://print.google.com/print%3Fq%3Dkevin%2Bstarr%2Brusticated&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;pg=PA40&amp;sig=nUJrmz7IYYSI_dlcTzPbqbfQqLU ]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes of [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] that:

{{quote|[[Harvard University|Harvard]]'s rigid rules and narrow curriculum had proved equally repressive. Rusticated for taking part in a student rebellion, Dana had spent six months in quiet rural study in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]] under a kindly clerical tutor.}}

A biographer&lt;ref&gt;[http://print.google.com/print?hl=en&amp;id=BX2yToKJx40C&amp;dq=rusticated+college&amp;prev=http://print.google.com/print%3Fq%3Drusticated%2Bcollege&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;pg=PA82&amp;sig=Ikpr0Mt59U2fTYqDgSmuQweYQ_w ]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to one of [[James Russell Lowell]]'s college letters as "written while he was at [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] because rusticated".

In a 1932 letter to [[TIME Magazine]], publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]] denied he had been expelled from [[Harvard College]], but had instead been "rusticated in [1886] for an excess of political enthusiasm" and had simply never returned.&lt;ref name="hearst"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Time Magazine]] |date=January 11, 1932 |title=Rusticated Hearst: A newspaper tycoon defends his Harvard record |url=http://ideas.time.com/letters/rusticated-hearst/?iid=op-article-notable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Rice University]], rustication is a punishment separate from suspension. Students who have been rusticated are banned from social activities on campus and are only allowed on campus to attend class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://students.rice.edu/students/Conduct.asp |title=Code of Conduct : Rice University |publisher=Students.rice.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1345">The '''Schism Act''' (13 Ann., c. 7) was a 1714 [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament of Great Britain]]. The Act stipulated that anyone who wished to keep a public or private school, or act as tutor, must first be granted a licence from a bishop. Also, he must conform to the liturgy of the [[Church of England]] and to have taken in the past year the rites of that Church. The Act was aimed against [[English Dissenters|Dissenter]] schools ([[dissenting academies]]), but on the day the Act was due to come into force, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] died&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Thomson, ''A Constitutional History of England. 1642 to 1801'' (London: Methuen, 1938), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Act was never enforced. Upon the Hanoverian succession in 1714 and the subsequent supremacy of the [[Whig (British political faction)|Whig party]], the Act was repealed by the [[Religious Worship Act 1718]].&lt;ref&gt;Dudley Julius Medley, ''A Student's Manual of English Constitutional History.

'''Small group learning''' is an [[educational]] approach that focuses on individuals learning in small groups and is distinguished from learning climate and organizational learning. It can take the form of a classroom-based training through experiential learning activities such as case study analysis, role plays, games, simulations, and brainstorming, among others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adult Learning Basics|last=Rothwell|first=William|publisher=American Society for Training and Development|year=2008|isbn=9781562865337|location=Alexandria, Virginia|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities require the learners to work together to achieve a learning goal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Group therapy|group]] work has to be carefully planned and frequently requires a [[facilitator]] to ensure group progress. In addition, the group function and the learning that takes place needs to be assessed and evaluated. The material learned is just as important as the group's ability to achieve a common [[Objective (goal)|goal]]. Facilitatory skills are important and require the [[teacher]] to ensure that both the task is achieved and the group functioning is maintained.

== Advantages ==
Small group learning allows [[students]] to develop [[problem solving|problem-solving]], interpersonal, presentational and [[communication]] skills, all beneficial to life outside the classroom. These generic [[skills]] are difficult to develop in isolation and require feedback and interaction with other individuals. Specific advantages of this learning model for the group of learners include the opportunity to compare learning performance with peers and the development of a sense of responsibility for their learning progress.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transforming Nursing Education Through Problem-based Learning|last=Rideout|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|year=2001|isbn=0763714275|location=Sudbury, MA|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small group learning is also used for adult learning because it is associated with active involvement, collaboration, and problem-solving.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=yNWB211tWJYC&amp;pg=PT149&amp;dq=%22Small+group+learning%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3_qX7suTeAhVSzqQKHQNXD7wQ6AEITTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Small%20group%20learning%22&amp;f=false|title=The Lecturer's Toolkit: A Practical Guide to Learning, Teaching &amp; Assessment|last=Race|first=Phil|date=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780749435394|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Although this practice is not the best way for students to develop and improve on these skills there are some ways to make this effective for both the student and the instructor. According to [[Francine Armenth-Brothers]] in her Article, "How to Make Small-Group Learning Work," some things to keep in mind when implementing this practice are, do not start without directions, which would help alleviate confusion in a group. Also, the instructor should choose the members in a group and when doing so keep learning levels and student diversity in mind.&lt;ref name="small group learning"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armenth-Brothers|first1=Francine|title=How to Make Small-Group Learning Work|journal=Teaching For Success|date=2009|issue=How to Become a Win-Win Teacher Hero|page=7|url=http://www.marin.edu/WORD-PPT/TFS_HowToMakeSmallGroupLearningWork.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts have criticized small group learning, especially that which consists of extremely small groups, for reducing learn-responsibility and thereby reducing the motivation learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When learning in a group, individuals can lose sight of their learning objectives and prioritize those they have in common in others. In addition, they may be subject to the free-rider effect in groups that have a few highly skilled members.

'''Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers, former Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Melioration (TIIM)''' ([[Uzbek language|Uzbek]]: Toshkent Irrigatsiya va Qishloq Xo'jaligini Mexanizatsiyalash Muhandislari Instituti (TIQXMMI)) or '''TIIAME''' is a unique university in Central Asia, which works for the development of the water industry, and supplies the country with professionals in this field. [[Tashkent]] Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers plays a huge role in the development of [[Uzbekistan]] economy and industry. Every year, talented students graduate from this university.

== History ==

The history of the Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers dates back to the [[Soviet Union]]. The university was first established in 1923 as the department of [[Turkistan State University]]. It was created under the technical faculty and was called [[Hydro Technical Engineering]]. In its first year of establishment, 24 agronomists and 16 water conservation specialists graduated from the faculty. The history of this university could be recognized by the second occasion. After six years of opening the Hydro Technical Engineering department, government decided to establish a new department under the Melioration Engineering Faculty. Those two departments were linked together in 1929, which led to the establishment of Central Asian Cotton Irrigation Polytechnic University. On 11 November 1934, Central Asian Cotton Irrigation Polytechnic University was merged with the Central Asian Institute of Agricultural Industry Irrigation and Mechanization, which was the reason for the creation of Tashkent Institute of Agricultural Industry Irrigation and Mechanization. In the first years of establishment there were only two faculties, Hydro Melioration and Mechanization. After [[World War II]], the agricultural industry of the country increased rapidly, which affected the need for professional employees.

After World War II, a number of faculties were created: Building (1945), Mechanization of Hydro Melioration (1946), and Hydro Energetics (1946). In 1974 a new faculty was named Technology of Repairing Agricultural Industry Machines and Creating Them. In 1979 a number of engineering faculties were opened, which was directly linked to the economic growth in Uzbekistan.

After the independence of Uzbekistan, all the textbooks were interpreted into [[Uzbek language]], and most of the classes started to be taught in the native language of Uzbekistan. In 2004, on 30 March by the edict of the Cabinet of Ministers of Uzbekistan, the institute obtained its current name.

=== Water industry management faculty ===

Until the 1970s there were no economists on the water industry in Uzbekistan. This caused some serious problems in water consumption and utilization. In 1974, in order to solve this problem, a new branch was opened under the faculty of Hydro Technical Constructions", called the Economy of Water Industry and its Analysis. In 1976, this branch was set as the independent faculty and started working as the one of the biggest parts of the institute. From the first years about 50 students were invited to the university and in 1979 the first 50 students graduated from this faculty. After the independence of Uzbekistan, from 2015 the faculty was renamed to its current name: Water Industry Management. Nowadays, the dean of the faculty is docent Ibragimov Abdimalik Gapparovich. In the campus of the faculty there are two language classes, four computer classes, and more than 20 study classes, which are supplied with the modern education materials and information technologies.

Seven departments which are located in the Water Industry Management faculty:
* Information technologies 
* Water industry economy
* Control under the water industry
* Theoretical economy
* Accounting and audit

After some years the faculty was called as the Hydro Technical Building. However, big changes to the faculty came in the independence years of Uzbekistan. In 1991 the faculty was considered to be as the department due to the changes in infrastructure. During those years, the faculty worked as part of the Center for Preparing the Irrigation Engineers" and from 1996 it became part of the Hydro Melioration faculty" and prepared professionals in the water industry building" field. After the edict made by the Cabinet of Ministers of Uzbekistan, the small department became the fully functioning faculty with the name Building of Irrigation Hydro Technical Constructions and Utilization.

An '''ammattikorkeakoulu''' ('''yrkeshögskola''' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], '''polytechnic''' or '''university of applied sciences''' in English), abbreviated ''AMK'', is a [[Education in Finland|Finnish institution of higher education]].

== Significance ==
The term literally means "school of higher [[vocational education]]". Although the term is often translated into English as "[[Institute of technology|polytechnic]]", the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture and the Rectors' Conference of Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences use the term "university of applied sciences".&lt;ref&gt;[http://minedu.fi/en/heis-and-science-agencies Ministry of Education and Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arene.fi/en/universities-applied-sciences ARENE: Rectors' Conference of Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike universities, AMKs focus on [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] by applying previous knowledge, rather than producing new research.  They have a very clearly legislated objective in regional development. As there is mandatory five-month practical training for all students, AMKs may be a good platform for dispersing applied knowledge throughout higher education. AMKs provide professionals for locally important purposes and are governed by the city,{{clarify|Not all AMKs have cities as their principal|date=May 2014}} although they receive most of the funding from the state. No [[Tuition payments|tuition fees]] are asked from the students.

==History==
Before the AMK reform in 1993, the schools were usually called ''opisto'' and were considered vocational institutes, and were not considered universities. Their role was to give training for roles that need both practical skills and management work, such as a foreman in construction. In engineering, the degree was referred to as ''opistoinsinööri'' or ''teknikko''. In construction, there was ''rakennusinsinööri'', ''rakennusarkkitehti'' and ''rakennusmestari''.

Until recently{{when|date=September 2015}}, AMKs were granting only tertiary degrees (3–4 years) that are specialized to particular vocations (e.g. ''insinööri'', translated into English as [[Bachelor of Engineering]]); they are different from, but in their level comparable to, academic [[bachelor's degree]]s which are awarded by universities. In 2005, "higher AMK" degrees (which are translated into English as [[master's degree]]s) have been introduced for holders of an AMK degree or a similar degree, like a bachelor's degree from a university, to continue studies while also working. AMK's do not grant the higher degrees of [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] and [[Ph.D.]] granted by universities, and a holder of an AMK higher degree is not eligible for doctoral studies in universities without specific studies bridging the gap between the two orientations (academic and vocational).

Finnish higher education has a dual model, where [[University|universities]] (yliopisto) focus on scientific or artistic master's and higher degrees, and AMKs on vocationally oriented education on bachelor and master levels. The phrase "equal but different" was used in conjunction with the dual model, meaning that Finnish AMKs and universities serve different goals in the field of higher education and should not be combined on any level. The ongoing [[Bologna process]], however, has led to some reform, where by complementing AMK studies with some theoretical studies, the route to higher degrees is open. Changes are described in detail in [[Education in Finland]].

There are about 100,000 students in AMKs. The most common field of education is [[engineering]], in which the schools offer high-level majors starting from a broad base of mathematics and physics related to the field of study. Engineers graduate after a minimum of four years and 240 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] credits are awarded. The degree of [[insinööri (amk)]] or [[ingenjör (YH)]] (for Swedish-speaking population) is often compared to the non-Finnish 'Bachelor of Engineering'.

Other typical fields of study in an ''ammattikorkeakoulu'' are health care ([[nursing]]), business, and culture.

===More accurate naming===
The term "university of applied sciences" was universally applied on January 1, 2006 to all Finnish ''ammattikorkeakoulu''s to give a more correct impression of the level of education given. The term is borrowed from the German "[[Fachhochschule]]". The decision could be made by the ''ammattikorkeakoulu''s, because there is no legislation concerning the translations of the terms.

Because degrees from an AMK are more oriented towards practical applications, compared to the degrees offered by Universities in Finland, a holder of an AMK degree, wishing to get a master's degree from a Finnish university, may have to complete 60 ETCS worth of theoretical and scientific studies in addition to the normal master's degree requirement.

Since 2005, the Finnish Parliament has approved the creation of a higher AMK degree, similar to the master's degree in universities. This has led to a small-scale boost in new degree programmes (in limited fields of education), to the extent of 60-90 ECTS credits. They will give similar qualifications as a university master's degree in the same areas of education. But a minimum amount of 3 years of work experience gained after latest tertiary degree is needed to qualify for AMK higher degree programme.

At the end of 2010, there were nationwide discussions about the excessive number of students in AMKs, especially in the fields of Engineering and Business. This is connected to a problem in funding — AMKs receive their funding largely based on the students enrollment numbers (this is changing to a more management-by-results approach).{{clarify|date=December 2011}}   This has led to an oversupply of AMK-educated people, compared to the needs of the labour market &amp;mdash; the unemployment of AMK graduates is 8%, on par with the general unemployment rate.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Some cuts to the amount of student places were issued by the [[Ministry of Education (Finland)|Ministry of Education]], starting with a nationwide cut of 10% applied to the new student intake in 2007 and 2008.

'''Writers of the Future''' ('''WOTF''') is a [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] story contest that was established by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] in the early 1980s. A sister contest, '''Illustrators of the Future,''' presents awards for science fiction art.  Hubbard characterized the contest as a way of "giving back" to the field that had defined his professional writing life.  The contest has no entry fee and is the highest-paying contest for amateur science-fiction and fantasy writers.  Notable past winners of WOTF include [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], [[Karen Joy Fowler]], [[James Alan Gardner]], [[Nina Kiriki Hoffman]], [[Jay Lake]], [[Michael H. Payne]], [[Patrick Rothfuss]], [[Robert Reed (author)|Robert Reed]], [[Dean Wesley Smith]], [[Sean Williams (author)|Sean Williams]], [[Dave Wolverton]], [[Nancy Farmer (author)|Nancy Farmer]], and [[David Zindell]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Contest rules and procedures==

===Writers of the Future===
The Writers of the Future (WOTF) contest may be entered quarterly, and is open to authors who have no, or few, professional publications. The contest rules state that entrants cannot have had published "a [[novel]] or [[novella|short novel]], or more than one [[Novella|novelette]], or more than three [[short story|short stories]], in any medium. Professional publication is deemed to be payment and at least 5,000 copies or 5,000 hits."  Works that are less than 3,000 words and for which payment was less 6c/word, do not count as "professional" publications.  Stories of up to 17,000 words in length can be submitted to the contest. Poems, screenplays, non-fiction, etc., are not eligible.&lt;ref name=rules&gt;
{{Citation
  | title = Contest Rules
  | date = 
  | year = 
  | url = http://www.writersofthefuture.com/rules.htm
  | publisher =  Writers of the Future web site 
  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscripts are judged with the authors' names deleted and are separated out in quarterfinal and semifinal award rounds by the Coordinating Judge (previously [[K. D. Wentworth]], currently [[Dave Wolverton]], and originally [[Algis Budrys]]). Eight finalists are sent to a panel of professional science fiction writers, who determine the top three awards. Prizes are $1000 (first place), $750 (second) and $500 (third).  The process is then repeated the next quarter.  At the end of the contest year, the four quarterly first place stories compete for a separate annual grand prize, the "Gold Award," which includes an additional $5000. The first, second and third-place winners and often a selection of the other finalist stories are published annually, for which the writers receive additional compensation for publication rights.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;  Thus, a grand prize-winning author can make over $6000 for a single story - more than many writers receive for a first novel.&lt;ref&gt;Buckell, Tobias, "[http://www.tobiasbuckell.com/2005/10/05/author-advance-survey-version-20/ Author Advance Survey]," version 2.0 (Oct 2005), retrieved 25 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some finalist stories not considered among the top three (in effect, the fourth or fifth placers) may be included in the annual anthology.  These are called "published finalists."  The writers are compensated for publication rights, but are not considered winners and receive no prize money, but are eligible to re-enter the contest.  Often writers will repeatedly enter the contest, quarter after quarter, until they either win or become ineligible due to publications elsewhere.

===Illustrators of the Future===
An artists' contest, the Illustrators of the Future (IOTF), was added in 1988.  Like the WOTF contest, the Illustrators contest is open to amateurs.  The Rules state: "The Contest is open to those who have not previously published more than three black-and-white story illustrations, or more than one process-color painting, in media distributed nationally to the general public, such as magazines or books sold at newsstands, or books sold in stores merchandising to the general public. The submitted entry shall not have been previously published in professional media as exampled above."&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

Entrants submit a portfolio of three pieces of artwork, which are circulated among the judges.  Up to three winners are selected every quarter, each given a prize of $500.  Unlike the Writers, the Illustrators are not ranked.  After the completion of the contest year, each of the twelve Illustration winners is assigned one of the stories from among the twelve Writer winners, and given a month to return the finished illustration.  A single grand prize, also called the Gold Award, is accompanied by a prize of $5000 - judging is based only on the final illustration, not the initial portfolio.  While the art is judged according to standard artistic considerations (composition, draftsmanship, consistency of lighting, [[sense of wonder]], facial expressions, etc.), a key consideration during the final judging is whether or not the art would make the viewer want to read the accompanying story.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;  The art is also included in the annual anthology, and illustrators are additionally compensated.

===Awards and workshop===
No official tallies are given for the number of entrants in either contest, but it is believed that thousands enter the Writers contest every quarter, while only hundreds enter the Illustration contest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Thus, the Illustration judges are sometimes often unable to find three deserving winners, and only pick one or two.  (This is not a problem for the Writing judges.)  Should the Illustration winners number less than twelve in a year, each illustrator is - as usual - assigned a single story to illustrate for purposes of determining who wins the Gold Award.  Returning the assigned illustration quickly does not directly correlate to winning the Gold Award, but those artists who do so are allowed the opportunity to illustrate additional stories.   

All winners and published finalists are invited to attend the annual week-long writers' and artists' workshops and Awards gala at the invitation and expense of the contest administration.  Tuxedoes and gowns are worn by the judges, administrators, and winners for the Awards gala (but members of the general public are casually attired), and various Hollywood actors are generally in attendance, in addition to prominent science fiction authors and artists.  These include the present judges in addition to a famous and generally elderly writer given a Lifetime Achievement Award.  While it is not required to attend the week-long festivities and seminars, it is thought by some that those in the running for the Gold Award may advance their cause by displaying professionalism and hard work at that time; judges for the contest, however, refute this, as the judging is done blindly in advance of the week-long pre-awards event and most judges don't arrive on site until the last day of the workshop.

==Judges==
Many noted writers and artists have judged WotF awards, or have won them themselves.
Notable writing judges have included: [[Kevin J. Anderson]], [[Gregory Benford]], [[Algis Budrys]], [[Orson Scott Card]], [[Brian Herbert]], [[Nina Kiriki Hoffman]], [[Anne McCaffrey]], [[Larry Niven]], [[Andre Norton]], [[Frederik Pohl]], [[Jerry Pournelle]], [[Tim Powers]], [[Brandon Sanderson]], [[Robert J.

==Connections to Scientology==
[[File:WOTF22cover.png|thumb|121px|Cover of Volume 22 of the anthology series ''Writers of the Future'', prominently featuring Hubbard's name]]

The original sponsor of the contest was [[Bridge Publications (Scientology)|Bridge Publications]], Inc., the publishing arm of the [[Church of Scientology]]. Prior to the 2004 contest, the sponsorship moved to [[Author Services Inc.]] under the [[trade name]] [[Galaxy Press]], which was spun off from Bridge to publish Hubbard's fiction and the contest anthologies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The contest has also been characterized as a promotional vehicle for Hubbard himself, who returned to science fiction writing with ''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'' at about the same time as he began the contest. On the covers of the annual WOTF anthologies, Hubbard's name appears "above the title", and in at least as prominent a font. The prominence of Hubbard's name and the lavish funding of the contest awards, publicity and ceremonies have led some to speculate that the contest is part of a campaign by the Church of Scientology to promote Hubbard's status in the science fiction and literary communities.&lt;ref&gt;

  | isbn = 0-312-13486-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entering or winning the contest does not require or imply endorsement or membership in the Church of Scientology, and the contest itself has been endorsed by a wide range of well-known speculative fiction writers (see Judges and Winners above) who have no relationship to Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;

According to Director of the Writers and Illustrators Contests Joni Labaqui, the funds to underwrite the contest—including the cash prizes, the gala awards ceremony and the weeklong pre-awards festivities—come from the Hubbard estate. The Hubbard estate is separate from the Church of Scientology and earns royalties from sales of Hubbard's books, including his fiction. Labaqui also reports that staff of Author Services Inc. is entirely made up of Scientologists.&lt;ref&gt;

However, records with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] show that the rights to the Writers of the Future name were transferred from the L. Ron Hubbard estate ("Family Trust-B") to the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Trademark Assignment Abstract of Title | url = http://assignments.uspto.gov/assignments/q?db=tm&amp;sno=73703450 | work =  | publisher = [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] | date = 1989-01-03 | accessdate = 2008-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and under the 1993 [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] closing agreement with the Church of Scientology, the L. Ron Hubbard estate became part of the Church of Spiritual Technology, a "Scientology-related entity".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Scientology Settles With IRS | date = 1997-12-30 | newspaper = [[Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
