'''3D makeR Technologies''' ('''makeR''')  is a [[3d printer|3D printer]] manufacturer. Their product line includes the 3D printer series, PEGASUS. The company started out as an open-source printer company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =HAZ TU PROPIA IMPRESORA 3D CON ESTE EMPRENDIMIENTO COLOMBIANO|url=http://www.enter.co/especiales/innovacion/haz-tu-propia-impresora-3d-con-este-emprendimiento-colombiano/|accessdate=2017-02-09|date=2015-02-05|publisher=Enter.co|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded between [[Barcelona]] and [[Santa Marta]] by Carlos Camargo, who currently acts as the CEO of the company. Following the traditional [[RepRap project|RepRap]] model, the makeR's first products were as [[do it yourself]] kits with an alternative version based on open-source FDM 3D printer [[Prusa i3]], called Prusa Tairona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =Emprendedor costeño diseña ‘kit’ de impresora 3D casera|url=https://www.elheraldo.co/tendencias/el-boom-aqui-y-ahora-sera-la-impresion-en-3d-236671|accessdate=2017-02-09|date=2016-01-04|publisher=[[El Heraldo (Colombia)|El Heraldo]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current makeR 3D printers are designed with a closed frame and selected build sizes.

The makeR 3D printers are compatible with [[polylactic acid]] (PLA), [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS), [[thermoplastic polyurethane]] (TPU), [[Polystyrene#Copolymers|high-impact polystyrene]] (HIPS), [[Polyvinyl acetate|polyvinyl alcohol]] (PVA) and some specials materials for industrial needs, such as PLA filament mixed with particles of metals which through sanding 3D printed parts provide appearance similar to metals ([[steel]], [[copper]], and [[aluminium]]). Also, makeR printers print with [[Nylon|nylon]] and [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|carbon fiber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =Meet PEGASUS 3D Printer|url=https://somosmaker.com/pegasus/|accessdate=2017-02-09|publisher=[[3D makeR Technologies S.A.S.]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeply religious, he regarded both religion and philosophy as valid and true; but separate, concerned with different issues, and proceeding by different means.  He thus rejected the claims of the theologians employing [[Ilm al-Kalam]] to have built a theology "proved" by rationality and of the [[Brethren of Purity]] to offer a synthesis of philosophy and religion.

His best-known work is ''Siwān al-Ḥikma'' "Vessel of Wisdom", a history of philosophy from the beginning to his own time.

The '''African Peoples Socialist Party''' (APSP) is a far-left [[pan-Africanist]] organization working towards [[reparations for slavery]] in the United States, identifying ideologically with 'African internationalism.' The Party was formed in May 1972 by the merger of three black power organizations based in Florida and Kentucky. [[Omali Yeshitela]], one of the original co-founders, leads the APSP as of 2018.

According to the APSP's website,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
During the 1970s, the Party had made its main goals to keep the Black Power Movement alive, defend the countless Africans locked up by the counterinsurgency [US law enforcement], and develop relationships with Africa and Africans worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;APSP "History"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History ==
In September 1979, the Party founded the African National Prison Organization (ANPO) .

In 1981, the Party moved its national office to [[Oakland, California]], United States, and opened the Uhuru house. The first Party Congress was held in Oakland in 1982. At that Congress, the party passed the resolution to create the [[African Socialist International]] (ASI) organization. The ASI sought to be the "international party of the African working class."&lt;ref&gt;Chairman Omali Yeshitela, ASI [http://asiuhuru.org/about/documents/resolutions/main_english.html "Main Resolution" ] (2004). Retrieved May 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The ASI has activists and has held conferences in various countries outside the United States.

Also in 1982, the APSP founded the African National Reparations Organization, and the First World Tribunal on Reparations for African People was held in [[BROOKLYN, New York|Brooklyn, New York]]. The APSP claims that "through this work, the African People's Socialist Party gave birth to the modern Reparations Movement." The objective is to obtain compensation for the injustices of slavery, as well as segregation and neocolonialism since then.

Sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s, the party's national office moved back to [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].

On December 11, 2017, Omali Yeshitela announced that [[YouTuber]] Gazi Kodzo would become the Secretary General of the African People's Socialist Party.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/GaziKodzo/photos/a.247318795721587.1073741828.144135316039936/383992138720918/?type=3&amp;theater&lt;/ref&gt; Gazi Kodzo was removed from the position and ejected from the Party on Nov. 18, 2018 for disciplinary reasons following a vote.

'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]]{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=59}}{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=27}} that advocates [[Self-governance|self-governed]] societies based on voluntary, [[Cooperative|cooperative]] institutions, rejecting unjust [[hierarchy]]. These institutions are often described as [[Stateless society|stateless societies]],{{sfn|Woodcock|ps=:ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kropotkin|1910}}:''"In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions."''&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Craig|2005|p=14|ps=: Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable}}{{sfn|Sheehan|2003|p=85}} although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical or [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]].{{sfn|Suissa|2006|p=7|ps=:[...] as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that they find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state.}}{{sfn|IAF|2012|ps=:The IAF – IFA fights for : the abolition of all forms of authority whether economical, political, social, religious, cultural or sexual.}}{{sfn|Kropotkin|1898|ps=: That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organization and preaches free agreement — at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist.}}{{sfn|The Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective|2017|loc= B.1 Why are anarchists against authority and hierarchy?|ps=:anarchists are opposed to irrational (e.g., illegitimate) authority, in other words, hierarchy — hierarchy being the institutionalization of authority within a society}} Anarchism holds [[capitalism]], the [[State (polity)|state]], and [[representative democracy]] to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful.&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malatesta|first=Errico|title=Towards Anarchism|journal = MAN! |publisher=International Group of San Francisco|location=Los Angeles|oclc=3930443|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1930s/xx/toanarchy.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107221404/http://marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1930s/xx/toanarchy.htm |archivedate =7 November 2012|deadurl=no|authorlink=Errico Malatesta|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070514.wxlanarchist14/BNStory/lifeWork/home/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516094548/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070514.wxlanarchist14/BNStory/lifeWork/home|archivedate=16 May 2007|deadurl=yes|title=Working for The Man|journal=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=14 April 2008|last=Agrell|first=Siri|date=14 May 2007|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9117285|title=Anarchism|year=2006|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Premium Service|accessdate=29 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214085638/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9117285 |archivedate=14 December 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2005|title=Anarchism|journal=The Shorter [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|page=14|quote=Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|McLean|McMillan|2003|loc= Anarchism}}

While [[Anti-statism|opposition to the state]] is central,{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=28|ps=:Anarchists do reject the state, as we will see. But to claim that this central aspect of anarchism is definitive is to sell anarchism short}} anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations.{{sfn|Proudhon|1849|ps=:Anarchy is the condition of existence of adult society, as hierarchy is the condition of primitive society. There is a continual progress in human society from hierarchy to anarchy."}}{{sfn|Bakunin|1882|ps=:In a word, we reject all legislation, all authority, and all privileged, licensed, official, and legal influence, even though arising from universal suffrage, convinced that it can turn only to the advantage of a dominant minority of exploiters against the interests of the immense majority in subjection to them. This is the sense in which we are really Anarchists.}}{{sfn|Armand|1926|ps=:In practice, any individual who, because of his or her temperament or because of conscious and serious reflection, repudiates all external authority or coercion, whether of a governmental, ethical, intellectual, or economic order, can be considered an anarchist. Everyone who consciously rejects the domination of people by other people or by the social ambiance, and its economic corollaries, can be said to be an anarchist as well}} Anarchism is usually considered a [[Far-left politics|far-left]] ideology{{sfn|Brooks|1994|p=xi|ps=:Usually considered to be an extreme left-wing ideology, anarchism has always included a significant strain of radical individualism, from the hyperrationalism of Godwin, to the egoism of Stirner, to the libertarians and anarcho-capitalists of today.}}{{sfn|Kahn|2000}}{{sfn|Moyihan|2007}} and much of [[anarchist economics]] and [[Anarchist law|anarchist legal philosophy]] reflects [[Libertarian socialism|anti-authoritarian interpretations]] of [[Anarcho-communism|communism]], [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], or [[participatory economics]].{{sfn|Guerin|1970|ps=:The anarchists were unanimous in subjecting authoritarian socialism to a barrage of severe criticism. At the time when they made violent and satirical attacks these were not entirely well founded, for those to whom they were addressed were either primitive or "vulgar" communists, whose thought had not yet been fertilized by Marxist humanism, or else, in the case of Marx and Engels themselves, were not as set on authority and state control as the anarchists made out."}}

Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy.{{sfn|Marshall|2010|p=16}} Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not all of which are mutually exclusive.{{sfn|Sylvan|2007|p= 231}} [[Anarchist schools of thought]] can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].{{sfn|McLean|McMillan|2003|loc= Anarchism}} Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of [[Social anarchism|social]] and [[individualist anarchism]] or similar dual classifications.{{sfn|Ostergaard|p=14|loc= Anarchism}}{{sfn|Kropotkin|2002|p=5}}{{sfn|Fowler|1972}}

== Etymology and terminology ==

There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as [[William Godwin]] and [[Wilhelm Weitling]], but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|p=27-37}}

The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{snf|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} the term "[[libertarianism]]" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guerin|1970|loc=The Basic Ideas of Anarchism}}: "At the end of the century in France, Sebastien Faure took up a word used in 1858 by one [[Joseph Dejacque]] {{sic}} to make it the title of a journal, Le Libertaire. Today the terms "anarchist" and "libertarian" have become interchangeable"&lt;/ref&gt; and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;

{{main|History of anarchism}}

=== Origins ===
&lt;!-- Anarcho-communist Joseph Déjacque, the first person to use the term "libertarian" in a political sense and self-proclaimed advocate of libertarianism, needs to be added here. His work and stances on anarchism are very relevant to this particular section of the article. Additionally, his criticisms of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's mutualism are very relevant here. --&gt;
The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC among the works of [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosopher [[Laozi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kropotkin|1910}}: ''" At the same time it evidently found its expression in the writings of some thinkers, since the times of Lao-tsze, although, owing to its non-scholastic and popular origin, it obviously found less sympathy among the scholars than the opposed tendency"''&lt;/ref&gt; and in later centuries by [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] and Bao Jingyan.{{sfn|Graham|2005}} Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist.&lt;ref name="ZhuangziAnarchist"&gt;

[[File:Levellers declaration and standard.gif|thumb|left|upright|[[Woodcut]] from a [[Diggers]] document by [[William Everard (Digger)|William Everard]]]]
The French [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance]] political philosopher [[Étienne de La Boétie]] wrote in his most famous work the ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Several historians of anarchism have gone so far as to classify La Botie's treatise itself as anarchist, which is incorrect since La Botie never extended his analysis from tyrannical government to government per se, but while La Botie cannot be considered an anarchist, his sweeping strictures on tyranny and the universality of his political philosophy lend themselves easily to such an expansion. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6o-8P3iqf7IC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=anarchism+la+boetie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z79GU1rW1t&amp;sig=4ini7oZUie2U8-P0BpMLogXYWPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eAOFUJCYJ4Le9AT_iYG4DA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=anarchism%20la%20boetie&amp;f=false ''Introduction to The Politics of Obedience: The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude''] by Murray Rothbard. Ludwig Von Mises Institute. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Quite rightly, La Boëtie recognizes the potential for domination in any democracy: the democratic leader, elected by the people, becomes intoxicated with his own power and teeters increasingly towards tyranny. Indeed, we can see modern democracy itself as an instance of voluntary servitude on a mass scale. It is not so much that we participate in an illusion whereby we are deceived by elites into thinking we have a genuine say in decision-making. It is rather that democracy itself has encouraged a mass contentment with powerlessness and a general love of submission."

Winstanley, deeming that property is corrupting, opposed clericalism, political power and privilege. It is economic inequality, he believed, that produces crime and misery. He championed a primitive communalism based on the pure teachings of God as comprehended through reason." [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Kenneth_C._Wenzer__Godwin_s_Place_in_the_Anarchist_Tradition___a_Bicentennial_Tribute.html Kenneth C. Wenzer. "Godwin's Place in the Anarchist Tradition — a Bicentennial Tribute"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It was in these conditions of class struggle that, among a whole cluster of radical groups such as the Fifth Monarchy Men, the [[Levellers]] and the Ranters, there emerged perhaps the first real proto-anarchists, the Diggers, who like the classical 19th-century anarchists identified political and economic power and who believed that a social, rather than political revolution was necessary for the establishment of justice. Gerrard Winstanley, the Diggers' leader, made an identification with the word of God and the principle of reason, an equivalent philosophy to that found in [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]''." Marlow. "Anarchism and Christianity"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Although Proudhon was the first writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two predecessors outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of anarchism. The first was Gerrard Winstanley (1609 – c. 1660), a linen draper who led the small movement of the Diggers during the Commonwealth. Winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that followed the Civil War and against the inequality that the grandees of the New Model Army seemed intent on preserving. In 1649–1650 the Diggers squatted on stretches of common land in southern England and attempted to set up communities based on work on the land and the sharing of goods." George Woodcock Anarchism The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642 during the [[English Civil War]] as a [[Pejorative|term of abuse]], used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] against their [[Roundhead]] opponents.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml "Anarchism"], [[BBC Radio 4]] program, [[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]], Thursday 7 December 2006.

Modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;"Anarchism", ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia'' 2006 (UK version).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[William Godwin]], was "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work" according to Kropotkin.{{sfn|Kropotkin|1910}}]]
As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution, [[William Godwin]] developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought.&lt;ref name="Everhart, Robert B 1982. p. 115"&gt;Everhart, Robert B. The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="godwinsep" /&gt; According to [[Peter Kropotkin]], Godwin was "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work"{{sfn|Kropotkin|1910}} while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to Edmund Burke's '' [[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. "Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence&amp;nbsp;..." – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as [[philosophical anarchism]]. He argued in ''[[Political Justice]]'' (1793)&lt;ref name="godwinsep" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams, Ian 2001. p. 116"&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id=godwin|title=William Godwin|last=Philip|first=Mark|date=20 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]]|last=Godwin|first=William|authorlink=William Godwin|year=1796|publisher=G.G. and J. Robinson|oclc=2340417|origyear=1793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people's "mental enslavement" the foundations of law, [[property rights]] and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.

The French [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] is regarded as the first self-proclaimed anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work ''[[What is Property?]]'', published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Guerin, ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the theory of [[spontaneous order]] in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests. His famous quote on the matter is "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order". In ''What is Property?'', Proudhon answers with the famous accusation "[[Property is theft]]". In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed "property" (''propriété''), where owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish.&lt;ref name="proudhon-prop"&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''"[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property]"'' from ''"[[What is Property?]]"'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt; He contrasted this with what he called "possession", or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. However, Proudhon later added that "Property is Liberty" and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Stewart. Introduction to ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', Anchor Books, Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. 1969, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; His opposition to the state, organised religion and certain [[capitalist]] practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.

The [[Anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] [[Joseph Déjacque]] was the first person to describe himself as "[[Libertarianism|libertarian]]".&lt;ref name="Dejacque"&gt;Joseph Déjacque, [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle – Lettre à P.J.

[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/libertaire/n06/lib01.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844, the [[post-Hegelian]] philosopher [[Max Stirner]] published in Germany the book, ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', which would later be considered an influential early text of [[individualist anarchism]].&lt;ref name="SEP-Stirner"&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id=max-stirner|title=Max Stirner|last=Leopold|first=David|date=4 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; French anarchists active in the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 Revolution]] included [[Anselme Bellegarrigue]], Ernest Coeurderoy, Joseph Déjacque&lt;ref name="Dejacque"/&gt; and Proudhon himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/pierre-joseph-proudhon-toast-to-the-revolution|title=Toast to the Revolution|work=theanarchistlibrary.org|access-date=13 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003195513/http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/pierre-joseph-proudhon-toast-to-the-revolution|archivedate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/L_acitivit%C3%A9_d_un_socialiste_de_1848.html?id=wbrfSAAACAAJ|title=L'acitivité d'un socialiste de 1848|work=google.com.ec|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings.

According to George Woodcock: "These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's".&lt;ref&gt;George Woodcock.

Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports: "The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers".&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]], adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme.&lt;ref name=Graham-05&gt;Graham, Robert '[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm ''Anarchism''] (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) {{ISBN|1-55164-251-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paris Commune]] was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included [[Louise Michel]], the Reclus brothers ([[Élie Reclus]] and [[Élisée Reclus]]) and [[Eugene Varlin]] (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised. Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. The Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the "implementation of the binding mandate" in 1848 and for federation of communes), thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/commune.html|title=The Paris Commune|work=blackened.net|accessdate=30 April 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625232340/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/commune.html|archivedate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Woodcock states that "a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the libertarian collectivists Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and Elisée Reclus and Louise Michel".&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"/&gt;

The [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] sections of the First International were the precursors of the [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]], seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organization of labour".&lt;ref&gt;Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas'', Vol. 1, p. 100 [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886 as the date by which the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] would become standard.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt;

The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]] and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890, a second attempt—this time international in scope—to organise for the eight-hour day was made.

In 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which were important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]] and [[Christiaan Cornelissen]]. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the general strike or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a [[social revolution]] while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 |title=Extract of Malatesta's declaration |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002329/http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |language=fr |date=7 April 2005 |access-date=24 July 2018 |work=Fondation Besnard}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the trade union movement was [[reformism|reformist]] and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Skirda | first = Alexandre | title = [[Facing the Enemy|Facing the enemy: a history of anarchist organization from Proudhon to May 1968]] | publisher = A.

In 1881, the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Spanish Workers Federation]] was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement—anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour, CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58&amp;nbsp;million members at one point and playing a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beevor|first=Antony|authorlink=Antony Beevor|year=2006|title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0-297-84832-5|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNT was affiliated with the [[International Workers Association]], a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular, "[t]he anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Anarchism in Brazil|Brazil]], Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organisations was the [[Federación Obrera Regional Argentina]]&amp;nbsp;[...] it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions".&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"/&gt;

[[File:Lugi Gallean2.jpg|thumb|upright|Italian American anarchist [[Luigi Galleani]] whose followers, known as Galleanists, carried out a series of bombings and assassination attempts from 1914 to 1932 in what they saw as attacks on "tyrants" and "enemies of the people"]]
Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html |title="Action as Propaganda" by Johann Most, 25 July 1885 |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date=21 April 2003 |access-date=20 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521211430/http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html |archive-date=21 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as Beverly Gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder, but [[targeted killings]] of members of the [[ruling class]] at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population, such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gage|first=Beverly|title=The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in its First Age of Terror|location=New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|ISBN=978-0199759286|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Most himself once boasted that "the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents.

By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, "propaganda of the deed" to refer to individual bombings, [[regicide]]s and [[tyrannicide]]s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal "[[Confiscation|expropriations]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zabalaza.net/theory/txt_anok_comm_ap.htm |title="Anarchist-Communism" by Alain Pengam |access-date=12 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312022528/http://www.zabalaza.net/theory/txt_anok_comm_ap.htm |archivedate=12 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illegalism]] as a practice emerged and within it "[t]he acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("[[propaganda by the deed]]") and the anarchist burglars ("[[individual reappropriation]]") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society.

However, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts as soon as 1887. Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in ''Le Révolté'' that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in [[James H. Billington|Billington, James H.]] 1998. ''[[Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith]]'' New Jersey: Transaction Books, p 417.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement. The anarcho-syndicalist [[Fernand Pelloutier]] argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm |title=Table Of Contents |publisher=Blackrosebooks.net |date= |access-date=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political repression|State repression]] (including the infamous 1894 French ''[[lois scélérates]]'') of the anarchist and [[labour movement]]s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed in the first place to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French [[socialist movement]] into many groups and—following the suppression of the 1871—Paris Commune the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'' to [[penal colonies]] favoured individualist political expression and acts.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes: &lt;blockquote&gt; "In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]'s '[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]' of 1793–1794. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]'s imperialist expansion – in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France's leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad." {{Cite journal | last = Anderson | first = Benedict | author-link = Benedict Anderson | title = In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 28 | pages = 85–129 | publisher = New Left Review | date = July–August 2004 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/28/benedict-anderson-in-the-world-shadow-of-bismarck-and-nobel | ref = harv | postscript = .| access-date = 2016-01-07 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151219130121/http://newleftreview.org/II/28/benedict-anderson-in-the-world-shadow-of-bismarck-and-nobel | archive-date = 2015-12-19 }} &lt;/blockquote&gt; According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organization may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]] and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-520-07297-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition the conflict culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]], which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Avrich|first=Paul|title=The Russian Anarchists|publisher=AK Press|location=Stirling|year=2006|isbn=1-904859-48-8|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Free Territory]], they fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against the [[White movement|Whites]] (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno, who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and [[Alexander Berkman]] were among those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, Bakunin's predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new "socialist" Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.&lt;ref name="bakuninmarx"&gt;"[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]" in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Emma|title=My Disillusionment in Russia|chapter=Preface|page=xx|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|year=2003|isbn=0-486-43270-X|quote=My critic further charged me with believing that "had the Russians made the Revolution à la Bakunin instead of à la Marx" the result would have been different and more satisfactory.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example and [[Communist party|communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) left the organisations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Drachkovitch | editor1-first = Milorad M. |first=Max |last=Nomad |contribution=The Anarchist Tradition |title = Revolutionary Internationals 1864 1943 | publisher = Stanford University Press |page=88 | year = 1966 | isbn = 0-8047-0293-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revolutions of 1917–1923|revolutionary wave of 1917–1923]] saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]]19 which established the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], the anarchists [[Gustav Landauer]], [[Silvio Gesell]] and [[Erich Mühsam]] had important leadership positions within the revolutionary [[Council communism|councilist]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;"The Munich Soviet (or "Council Republic") of 1919 exhibited certain features of the TAZ, even though — like most revolutions — its stated goals were not exactly "temporary." Gustav Landauer's participation as Minister of Culture along with Silvio Gesell as Minister of Economics and other anti-authoritarian and extreme libertarian socialists such as the poet/playwrights Erich Mühsam and Ernst Toller, and Ret Marut (the novelist B.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of [[fascism in Europe]] transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Fascism|fascists]]. Italian anarchists played a key role in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 "Daring but Divided"] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The veteran Italian anarchist Luigi Fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as "the preventive counter-revolution".{{sfn|Graham|2005}} In France, where the [[far-right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David.

=== Spanish Revolution ===
{{main|Spanish Revolution of 1936}}

In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right-wing election victory. In 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, conservative members of the military, with the support of minority extreme-right parties, responded with an attempted coup, causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beevor|first=Antony|authorlink=Antony Beevor|year=2006|page=46|title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0-297-84832-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the army rebellion, an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[Collective farming|collectivised]] the land.&lt;ref name="Bolloten 1984, p.54"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bolloten | first = Burnett | authorlink = Burnett Bolloten | coauthors = | title = The Spanish Civil War: Revolution and Counterrevolution | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | date = 15 November 1984 |  page =1107 |    isbn = 978-0-8078-1906-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the anarchists were losing ground even before the fascist victory in 1939 in a bitter struggle with the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]], who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]] cause from the [[Soviet Union]]. According to [[Noam Chomsky]], "the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish anarchists. Not just in Catalonia—the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere. The communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] and were very much opposed to the anarchists, partially because [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with Western countries against [[Adolf Hitler]]. That failed and Stalin withdrew the support to the Republic. They even withdrew the Spanish gold reserves".&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehumanist.com/magazine/july-august-2016/features/rescuing-memory "Rescuing Memory: the Humanist Interview with Noam Chomsky"] [[The Humanist]] TheHumanist.com N. p., 2016.

Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control and in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy [[Communist Party of Spain]] influence as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivisation enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, [[Agriculture|agrarian]] areas became collectivised and run as libertarian [[commune]]s.

By the late sixties, political protest was intertwined with cultural radicalism based on a critique of all authority and all hierarchies of power. Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies. The influence of anarchism was strongest among radical feminists, in the commune movement, and probably in the Weather Underground and elsewhere in the violent fringe of the anti-war movement."

== Anarchist schools of thought ==
{{main|Anarchist schools of thought}}
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] was the primary proponent of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|anarcho-mutualism]] and influenced many future [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchist]] thinkers]]
[[Anarchist schools of thought]] had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, [[individualist anarchism]] and [[social anarchism]], which have some different origins, values and evolution.{{sfn|McLean|McMillan|2003|loc= Anarchism}}{{sfn|Ostergaard|p=14|loc= Anarchism}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/archive/Anarchism |title=Anarchism|website=libertarian-labyrinth.org|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090405223616/https://libertarian-labyrinth.org/archive/Anarchism|archivedate=5 April 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1855069954 The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt; The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises [[negative liberty]], i.e. opposition to state or [[social control]] over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise [[positive liberty]] to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil, "recognising equality of entitlement".&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Kevin and Boyd, Tony. ''Understanding Political Ideas and Movements''. Manchester University Press 2003, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical—those created throughout the 19th century—and post-classical anarchist schools—those created since the mid-20th century and after.

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is [[philosophical anarchism]], which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2 January 2003). Anarchism.

(March 1986), pp. 300–02.&lt;/ref&gt; philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a [[Minarchism|minimal state]] as unfortunate, and usually temporary, "necessary evil" but argue that citizens do not have a [[moral obligation]] to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Klosko, George. ''Political Obligations''. Oxford University Press 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was "[[anarchism without adjectives]]", a call for [[toleration]] first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the "bitter debates" of anarchist theory at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the [[anti-authoritarian]] beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard "Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868–1898" [p. 135].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mutualism ===
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
[[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualism]] began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"A member of a community," ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticised [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests of Valley Forge; Shawn Wilburn, 2006, "More from the 1826 "Mutualist"?".&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon proposed spontaneous order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a "positive anarchy" where order arises when everybody does "what he wishes and only what he wishes"&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and where "business transactions alone produce the social order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon |first=Pierre-Joseph |authorlink=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon |title=The Principle of Federation |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1979 |isbn=0-8020-5458-7 |quote=The notion of ''anarchy'' in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers' movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned [[cooperative]]s, promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service.

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist [[William Batchelder Greene]], each worker in the mutualist system would receive "just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount".&lt;ref&gt;"Communism versus Mutualism", ''Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments''. (Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard, 1875) William Batchelder Greene: "Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member."&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', Princeton University Press 1996 {{ISBN|0-691-04494-5}}, p. 6&lt;br /&gt;''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', Blackwell Publishing 1991 {{ISBN|0-631-17944-5}}, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon first characterised his goal as a "third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property".&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''What Is Property?'' Princeton, MA: Benjamin R. Tucker, 1876. p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social anarchism ===
{{main|Social anarchism}}
[[Social anarchism]] calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or [[coercion]]. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;"This does not mean that the majority thread within the anarchist movement is uncritical of individualist anarchism. Far from it! Social anarchists have argued that this influence of non-anarchist ideas means that while its "criticism of the State is very searching, and [its] defence of the rights of the individual very powerful," like Spencer it "opens&amp;nbsp;... the way for reconstituting under the heading of 'defence' all the functions of the State."

[[AK Press]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or propaganda by the deed, which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.&lt;ref name = "Patsouras-p54" /&gt;

However, collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively "uphold[ing] the wages system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |title=The Conquest of Bread |publisher=AK Press |location=Edinburgh |year=2007 |chapter=13 |isbn=978-1-904859-10-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]], but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakunin |first=Mikhail |title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1990 |isbn=0-521-36182-6 |quote=They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship&amp;nbsp;– their dictatorship, of course&amp;nbsp;– can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not [[mutually exclusive]]—although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=James Guillaume|last=Guillaume|first=James|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm|title=Ideas on Social Organization|year=1876|accessdate=3 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some forms of anarchist communism such as [[insurrectionary anarchism]] are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom.&lt;ref name="bobblack"&gt;[[Post-left anarchy|Post-left]] anarcho-communist [[Bob Black]] after analysing insurrectionary anarcho-communist Luigi Galleani's view on anarcho-communism went as far as saying that "communism is the final fulfillment of individualism&amp;nbsp;...

It is nonsense to speak of "emphatically prioritizing the social over the individual,"...&amp;nbsp;You may as well speak of prioritizing the chicken over the egg.

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stuart Isaacs |author2=Chris Sparks |date=2004-05-20 |title=Political Theorists in Context |url={{google books|rlGFAgAAQBAJ|plainurl=yes}} |publisher=Routledge |p=248 |isbn=978-0-415-20126-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[direct action]] and [[workers' self-management]]. Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rocker, Rudolf. ''Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice'' (2004). AK Press. p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which in anarcho-syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"—rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish CNT played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement. It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War.

He is best known for his books ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, as well as his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Benjamin Tucker later fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''.

[[Anarcha-feminism]] (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with feminism. It generally views [[patriarchy]] as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by [[decentralised]] free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of [[class struggle]], and the anarchist struggle against the state. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. [[L. Susan Brown]] claims that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Emma Goldman and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]].

[[Anarcho-pacifism]] is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see [[non-violence]]).&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence |title="Resisting the Nation State, the pacifist and anarchist tradition" by Geoffrey Ostergaard |publisher=Ppu.org.uk |date=6 August 1945 |access-date=20 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514052437/http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It developed mostly in the Netherlands, Britain and the United States before and during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962" /&gt; Christian anarchism is a [[Christian movement|movement]] in [[political theology]] that combines anarchism and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=2–4 |url= |access-date=|quote=Locating Christian anarchism&amp;nbsp;...

[[Religious anarchism]] refers to a set of related anarchist ideologies that are inspired by the teachings of (organized) religions, but many anarchists have traditionally been skeptical of and opposed to [[organized religion]]. Many different religions have served as inspiration for religious forms of anarchism, most notably Christianity as Christian anarchists believe that biblical teachings give credence to anarchist philosophy. Non-Christian forms of religious anarchism include [[Buddhist anarchism]], [[Jewish anarchism]] and most recently [[Neopaganism]].

[[Synthesis anarchism]] is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.&lt;ref name="infoshop.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3|title=An Anarchist FAQ|date=14 February 2010|website=infoshop.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219221557/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3|archivedate=19 February 2010|deadurl=yes|access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the [[anarcho-communists]] [[Voline]] and [[Sébastien Faure]].&lt;ref name="infoshop1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faure, Sébastien.

[[Platformism]] is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of Dielo Truda's ''Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)''.&lt;ref name=Platformtext/&gt; The document was based on the experiences of [[Anarchism in Russia|Russian anarchists]] in the 1917 October Revolution, which led eventually to the victory of the [[Bolsheviks]] over the anarchists and other groups. The ''Platform'' attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the Russian Revolution.

[[Post-left anarchy]] is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional [[left-wing politics]].

[[Post-anarchism]] is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought, drawing from diverse ideas including post-left anarchy, [[postmodernism]], [[autonomism]], [[postcolonialism]] and the [[Situationist International]].

[[Queer anarchism]] is a form of [[socialism]] which suggests anarchism as a solution to the issues faced by the [[LGBT community]], mainly [[heteronormativity]], [[homophobia]], [[transphobia]] and [[biphobia]]. Anarcho-queer arose during the late 20th century based on the work of Michel Foucault ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''.

[[Left-wing market anarchism]] strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labour positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Chartier and Charles W. Johnson (eds). ''Markets Not Capitalism: Individualist Anarchism Against Bosses, Inequality, Corporate Power, and Structural Poverty''. Minor Compositions; 1st edition (5 November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Chartier has joined [[Kevin Carson]], [[Charles W. Johnson (philosopher)|Charles Johnson]], and others (echoing the language of Benjamin Tucker and [[Thomas Hodgskin]]) in maintaining that, because of its heritage and its emancipatory goals and potential, radical market anarchism should be seen—by its proponents and by others—as part of the [[socialist]] tradition, and that market anarchists can and should call themselves "socialists." See Gary Chartier, "Advocates of Freed Markets Should Oppose Capitalism," "Free-Market Anti-Capitalism?" session, annual conference, [[Association of Private Enterprise Education]] (Cæsar's Palace, Las Vegas, NV, 13 April 2010); Gary Chartier, [http://c4ss.org/content/1738 "Advocates of Freed Markets Should Embrace 'Anti-Capitalism'"]; Gary Chartier, [http://invisiblemolotov.wordpress.com/2009/09/12/socialist-ends-market-means/ ''Socialist Ends, Market Means: Five Essays'']. Cp. Tucker, "Socialism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"But there has always been a market-oriented strand of libertarian socialism that emphasizes voluntary cooperation between producers. And markets, properly understood, have always been about cooperation. As a commenter at Reason magazine's Hit&amp;Run blog, remarking on Jesse Walker's link to the Kelly article, put it: "every trade is a cooperative act." In fact, it's a fairly common observation among market anarchists that genuinely free markets have the most legitimate claim to the label 'socialism.'".[http://c4ss.org/content/670 "Socialism: A Perfectly Good Word Rehabilitated"] by [[Kevin Carson]] at website of Center for a Stateless Society&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-transhumanism]] is a recently new branch of anarchism that takes traditional and modern anarchism, typically drawing from [[anarcho-syndicalism]], [[left-libertarianism]] or [[Libertarian socialist|libertarian socialism]] and combines it with [[transhumanism]] and [[post-humanism]]. It can be described as a "liberal democratic revolution, at its core the idea that people are happiest when they have rational control over their lives. Reason, science, and technology provide one kind of control, slowly freeing us from ignorance, toil, pain, disease and limited lifespans (aging)".

Anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought and as such disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],&lt;ref name=oxcom&gt;"Anarchism." ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]], [[collectivism]], [[syndicalism]]/[[trade unionism]] and [[capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[veganarchism|veganism]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within anarcho-primitivism) and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[nihilist movement]]), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, Carmen García Trevijano, [https://books.google.com/books?id=s9iwZGv44psC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=Enciclopedia+teor%C3%ADa+pol%C3%ADtica&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA57,M1 ''Oxford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy''].&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].

Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by Emma Goldman, among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman "has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights.

It was founded in 1936 by [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]], Mercedes Comaposada and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón]] and had approximately 30,000 members. The organisation was based on the idea of a "double struggle" for [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]] and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel.

More recently, the British anarcho-pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the [[sexual revolution]] for writing the bestseller sex manual ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''. The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-[[hedonist]] philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] in such works as ''Théorie du corps amoureux.

For English anarchist William Godwin, education was "the main means by which change would be achieved".&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-good.htm|title=infed.org – William Godwin on education|work=infed.org|access-date=28 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514090500/http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-good.htm|archive-date=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt; For Godwin, education had to have a "respect for the child's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion", a "pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child's own motivation and initiatives" and a "concern about the child's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school".&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt; In his ''[[Political Justice]]'', he criticises state sponsored schooling "on account of its obvious alliance with national government".&lt;ref name="Enquiry Concerning Political Justice"&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/godwin/pj6.htm |at=Book 4: Of Opinion Considered as a Subject of Political Institution |chapter=1: General Effects of the Political Superintendence of Opinion |title=Enquiry Concerning Political Justice |first=William |last=Godwin  |edition=1st |id={{OCLC|680251053|642217608|504755839}} |publisher=G.G.J. and J.

His educational experiments, for example, possibly under the influence of the Swiss educational theorist [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] (via Owen), emphasized – as we would expect – the nurturing of the independence and the conscience of individual children, not the inculcation of pre-conceived values. |url=http://www.crispinsartwell.com/warrenintrocurrent.htm |title=Introduction of The Practical Anarchist: Writings of Josiah Warren |first=Crispin |last=Sartwell |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430010738/http://www.crispinsartwell.com/warrenintrocurrent.htm |archive-date=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called ''[[The False Principle of our Education]]'' in which Stirner names his educational principle "personalist", explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create "free men, sovereign characters", by which he means "eternal characters&amp;nbsp;[...] who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html |title=The False Principle of our Education |last=Stirner |first=Max |publisher=Tmh.floonet.net |date= |access-date=20 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515103317/https://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-Christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''Liberty'' (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt; and many anarchists were "ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''Lucifer, the Light-Bearer'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''...&amp;nbsp;The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself".&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt;

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia established "modern" or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Fidler"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Geoffrey C. Fidler |date=Spring–Summer 1985 |title=The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: "Por la Verdad y la Justicia" |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=1/2 |pages=103–132   |doi=10.2307/368893 |jstor=368893 |publisher=History of Education Society |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools' stated goal was to "educate the working class in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |title=Francisco Ferrer's Modern School |publisher=Flag.blackened.net |date= |access-date=20 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100807032003/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html| archivedate= 7 August 2010&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray Bookchin wrote: "This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally".&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 7, ''Anarchosyndicalism, The New Ferment''. In Murray Bookchin, ''[[The Spanish Anarchists: The Heroic Years, 1868–1936]]''. AK Press, 1998, p. 115. {{ISBN|1-873176-04-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; La Escuela Moderna and Ferrer's ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of ''[[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]]'' in the United States,&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt; Cuba, South America and London. The first of these was started in New York City in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901. Russian christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Matt_Hern__The_Emergence_of_Compulsory_Schooling_and_Anarchist_Resistance.html |title=The Emergence of Compulsory Schooling and Anarchist Resistance |publisher=Theanarchistlibrary.org |date=21 September 2010 |access-date=16 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221113805/http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Matt_Hern__The_Emergence_of_Compulsory_Schooling_and_Anarchist_Resistance.html |archive-date=21 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = A.N. | title = Tolstoy | publisher = Norton, W.

[Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary".&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt; For him, "without compulsion, education was transformed into culture".&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2"/&gt;

A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Purkis | first = Jon | title = Changing Anarchism | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-7190-6694-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;British anarchists [[Stuart Christie]] and Albert Meltzer manifested that "A.S. Neill is the modern pioneer of libertarian education and of "hearts not heads in the school". Though he has denied being an anarchist, it would be hard to know how else to describe his philosophy, though he is correct in recognising the difference between revolution in philosophy and pedagogy, and the revolutionary change of society. They are associated but not the same thing." Stuart Christie and Albert Meltzer.

The term [[deschooling]] was popularised by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Illich| first=Ivan |title=Deschooling Society |place= New York|publisher= Harper and Row| year= 1971| isbn= 0-06-012139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8195">'''Boris Porena''' ([[Rome]], 27 September 1927) is an Italian [[Intellectual|thinker]], [[music composer]] and didactical expert. He is married to Paola Bučan, a famous Croatian cellist and teacher who, until her retirement in 2014 was a tenured professor at the ''Conservatorio di Musica'' in [[Perugia]] (Italy).

He was a disciple of  [[Goffredo Petrassi]] – alongside other distinguished musicians such as [[Ennio Morricone]], [[Aldo Clementi]], and Sergio Cafaro. Although he was initially influenced by [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] poetics, he later evolved towards the use of the harmonic language of the late [[Renaissance]] period, which he has used with originality in order to build his own musical research which directly influenced his later compositional processes.

He started composing when only 12 years old. His career is effectively in two distinct and different periods – the first being up until 1967 during which time he gained a wide national and international success. From 1968, as consequence of the evolution of both his thought and his social involvement, he abstained from composing, a period which lasted for the next twenty years. During that time he devoted himself to a grassroots cultural practice and set up the Metacultural Centre, located at [[Cantalupo in Sabina]] (Rieti, Italy). In 1988 he began to compose again with renewed enthusiasm, starting on a new and different compositional phase.

As a musical critic he has written essays about his master, Goffredo Petrassi along with several other important texts about music; among them ''Musica/Società'' (Einaudi, 1975) stands out, going beyond purely musical issues and authoritatively examines and explores the fields of social and political analysis.

He has taught new didactics of composition at the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia|Santa Cecilia Conservatory]] in Rome and he has been director of the Research and Experimental Centre "Musica in Sabina". Among his many disciples are Jesús Villa-Rojo, [[Luca Lombardi]], Celestino Dionisi, Giuliano d'Angiolini, Derek Healey, [[James Clifford Brown]], Claudio Pietro, [[Jorge Peixinho|Jorge (Manuel Rosado Marques) Peixinho]], [[Armando Santiago]], Oliver Wehlmann, Massimo Fornetti, Alessandro De Rosa, Emanuele Pappalardo and many more.

His non compositional writings cover a number of other fields, especially pedagogy and grassroots didactics, but also philosophical reflections such as those expressed in "Metacultural Hypothesis: an hypothesis for survival" (1999).

He has a considerable and deep-seated interest in natural sciences which have led him to becoming something of an authority in [[entomology]] and especially in [[coleopterology]].

He has written a rich collection of poetry, especially in German, his mother tongue.

==The Hypothesis==

His deep interest in the global problems affecting contemporary society have led Boris Porena, together with the Metacultural Centre, to formulate the Metacultural Hypothesis (MCH), also known as "the Hypothesis".

This Hypothesis has known several formulations.

For example:

(Formulation 1)
Every one of our acts or thoughts, being a possible communication object, has in itself a cultural component which must be relativised with regard to the culture which has produced it.

But also:

(Formulation 2)
MCH coincides with the interruption of the principle of non contradiction.

And even in a third form:

(Formulation 3)
Given any proposition ''p'', it is always possible either to find or to build a local cultural universe LCU&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; within which ''p'' becomes 'true'

{{Semiotics}}
'''Charles William Morris''' (May 23, 1901 – January 15, 1979) was an American [[Semiotics|semiotician]] and [[Philosophy|philosopher]].

==Early life and education==
A son of Charles William and Laura (Campbell) Morris, Charles William Morris was born on May 23, 1901, in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].

Morris briefly attended the [[University of Wisconsin]], and later studied engineering and psychology at [[Northwestern University]], where he graduated with a B.S. in 1922. That same year, he entered the [[University of Chicago]] where he became a doctoral student in philosophy under the direction of [[George Herbert Mead]]. Morris completed his dissertation on a symbolic theory of mind and received a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1925.

==Career==
After his graduation, Morris turned to teaching, first at Rice University, and later at the University of Chicago. In 1958 he became Research Professor at the University of Florida. His students included semiotician [[Thomas A. Sebeok]]. In 1937 Morris presided over the Western Division of the American Philosophical Association, and was Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Morris was an instructor of philosophy for six years from 1925 to 1931 at [[Rice University]] in [[Houston]], Texas.&lt;ref name="Reisch 2005"&gt;Reisch, George A. “Morris, Charles William (1901-79)”. Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers Vol. 3. Ed. Shook. England. Thoemmes. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Rice, he was associate professor of philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1931 to 1947. Morris became a lecturing professor at Chicago in 1948, occupying the position until 1958 when he received an offer for a special appointment as a Research Professor at the [[University of Florida]], where he remained until his death.

During his time at Rice University, Morris wrote and defended his philosophical perspective known as neo-pragmatism. He also worked on and published ''Six Theories of Mind''.&lt;ref name="Reisch 2001"&gt;Reisch, George A. Guide to the Charles W. Morris Collection at the Peirce Edition Project, IUPUI. Created for the Indiana Scholarly Editions Consortium. Unpublished manuscript. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his term at Rice, Morris returned to the University of Chicago. In the early 1930s, the University of Chicago's philosophy department was unstable, but in the midst of change and difficult economic times, Morris felt that philosophy would serve as a torch that would light the way to saving world civilization.&lt;ref name="Reisch 2001"/&gt; Morris had hoped to create an institute of philosophy at the University of Chicago, but his efforts to convince the university president of such a venture were unsuccessful.

===Semiotics===
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
Morris's development of a behavioral theory of signs—i.e., [[semiotics]]—is partly due to his desire to unify  [[logical positivism]] with [[behavioral empiricism]] and [[pragmatism]].&lt;ref name="Posner"&gt;Posner, Roland. “Charles Morris and the Behavioral Foundations of Semiotics.” Classics of Semiotics. Ed. Krampen. Plemun Press. New York: 1987. pp. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris's union of these three philosophical perspectives eventuated in his claim that symbols have three types of relations: 
# to objects,
# to persons, and
# to other symbols.
He later called these relations "semantics", "pragmatics", and "syntactics".&lt;ref name="Posner" /&gt; Viewing semiotics as a way to bridge philosophical outlooks, Morris grounded his sign theory in Mead's social behaviorism. In fact, Morris's interpretation of an interpretant, a term used in the semiotics of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], has been understood to be strictly psychological.&lt;ref name="Dewey"&gt;Dewey, John. “Peirce's Theory of Linguistic Signs, Thought, and Meaning.” The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 43, No. 4 (Feb. 14, 1946), pp.85-95.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris's system of signs emphasizes the role of stimulus and response in the orientation, manipulation, and consummation phases of action. His mature semiotic theory is traced out in ''Signs, Language, and Behavior'' (1946).&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;Morris, Charles W.: Signs, Language and Behavior. New York: Prentice-Hall, 1946. Reprinted, New York: George Braziller, 1955. Reprinted in Charles Morris, Writings on the General Theory of Signs (The Hague: Mouton, 1971), pp. 73–397.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris's semiotic is concerned with explaining the tri-relation between syntactics, semantics, and pragmatics in a dyadic way, which is very different from the semiotics of C. S. Peirce. This caused some to argue that Morris misinterpreted Peirce by converting the interpretant into a logically ''existent'' thing.&lt;ref name="Dewey" /&gt;

===Institute for American Thought===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Toward the end of his life in 1976, Morris sent two instalments of his work to the Institute for American Thought (IAT) at [[Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis]] (IUPUI). Three years later in 1979, Morris's daughter, Sally Petrilli, arranged to have additional installments of his work sent to IUPUI. In 1984 Italian philosopher Ferruccio Rossi-Landi added to the Morris collection at IUPUI by sending his correspondence with Charles W. Morris. Among the vast Morris collection at the IAT are 381 titles of books and journal articles regarding pragmatism, logical empiricism, poetry, ethics, and Asian studies.

==Personal life==
In 1925, Morris married Gertrude  E. Thompson, with whom he had a daughter, Sally Morris Petrilli. In 1951, he married his second wife, Ellen Ruth Allen, a psychologist.

Charles William Morris died on January 15, 1979 in [[Gainesville, Florida]].

===Unity of Science Movement===
While on sabbatical from the University of Chicago in 1934, Morris traveled abroad, visiting Europe and meeting working philosophers such as [[Bertrand Russell]] and members of the [[Vienna Circle]], like [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[Moritz Schlick]]. Morris was greatly impressed with the logical positivist (logical empiricist) movement. While presenting a paper in [[Prague]] at the Eighth International Congress of Philosophy, he discussed his hopes for a union of pragmatism and positivism.&lt;ref name="Reisch 2001" /&gt; Sympathetic to the positivist's philosophical project, Morris became the most vocal advocate in the United States for Otto Neurath's "Unity of Science Movement".

During the 1930s, Morris helped several German and Austrian philosophers emigrate to the United States, including Rudolf Carnap in 1936. As a part of the "Unity of Science Movement", Morris worked closely with Neurath and Carnap to produce the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]''. As co-editor of the ''Encyclopedia'', Morris procured publication in America from the [[University of Chicago Press]]. His involvement with the ''Encyclopedia'' spanned for ten years when the project lost momentum in 1943.&lt;ref name="Reisch 2001" /&gt; Both Morris and Carnap found it difficult to keep the ''Encyclopedia'' alive due to insufficient funds. In the latter part of the 1940s, Morris was finally able to secure funding that allowed the project to last until its final publication in the 1970s.

{{Christian mysticism |theo/phil}}

'''Christianity and Hellenistic philosophies''' experienced complex interactions during the first to the fourth centuries.

As [[early centers of Christianity|Christianity spread throughout the Hellenic world]], an increasing number of church leaders were educated in [[Greek philosophy]]. The dominant philosophical traditions of the Greco-Roman world then were [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]], and [[Epicureanism]]. Stoicism and, particularly, Platonism were readily incorporated into [[Christian ethics]] and [[Christian theology]].

==Historic development==
Christian assimilation of Hellenic philosophy was anticipated by [[Philo]] and other Greek-speaking Alexandrian Jews. Philo's blend of Judaism, Platonism, and Stoicism strongly influenced Christian Alexandrian writers like [[Origen]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]], as well as, in the Latin world, [[Ambrose of Milan]].

One early [[Christian]] writer of the 2nd and early 3rd century, [[Clement of Alexandria]], demonstrated Greek thought in writing, {{quote|"Philosophy has been given to the Greeks as their own kind of Covenant, their foundation for the philosophy of Christ ... the philosophy of the Greeks ... contains the basic elements of that genuine and perfect knowledge which is higher than human ... even upon those spiritual objects." (Miscellanies 6. 8)}}

The Church historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] suggested, essentially, in his [[Praeparatio Evangelica|preparation for the Gospel]] that Greek philosophy, although in his view derivative, was concordant with Hebrew notions. [[Augustine of Hippo]], who ultimately systematized [[Christian philosophy]], wrote in the 4th and early 5th century, {{quote|But when I read those books of the Platonists I was taught by them to seek incorporeal truth, so I saw your 'invisible things, understood by the things that are made' (Confessions 7. 20).}}

[[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] (1892) noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/earlygreekphilo01burngoog|title=Early Greek Philosophy|page=88|year=1892|author=John Burnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''The Neoplatonists were quite justified in regarding themselves as the spiritual heirs of Pythagoras; and, in their hands, philosophy ceased to exist as such, and became theology. And this tendency was at work all along; hardly a single Greek philosopher was wholly uninfluenced by it. In later days, [[Apollonios of Tyana]] showed in practice what this sort of thing must ultimately lead to. The [[theurgy]] and [[thaumaturgy]] of the late Greek schools were only the fruit of the seed sown by the generation which immediately preceded the Persian War.''

==Conception of God==
Commentary from [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]], [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] (1870, p. 620).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/620/mode/2up|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year=1870|author=Sir Smith William|pages=620}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:One, or unity, is the essence of number, or absolute number. As absolute number it is the origin of all numbers, and so of all things. (According to another passage of Aristotle, Met. xii. 6. p. 1080, b. 7. number is produced) This original unity they also termed God (Ritter, Gesch. der FML vol. i. p. 389). These propositions, however, would, taken alone, give but a very partial idea of the [[Pythagorean system]]. A most important part is played in it by the ideas of limit, and the unlimited. They are, in fact, the fundamental ideas of the whole. One of the first declarations in the work of [[Philolaus]] was, that all things in the universe result from a combination of the unlimited and the limiting; for if all things had been unlimited, nothing could have been the object of [[wikt:cognizance|cognizance]]. 

It was not until the fusion of Platonic and Aristotelian theology with Christianity that the concepts of strict omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence became commonplace. The [[Platonism|Platonic]] [[Theory of Forms]] had an enormous influence on Hellenic Christian views of God. In those philosophies, Forms were the ideals of every object in the physical world, and objects in the physical world were merely shadows of those perfect forms. Platonic philosophers were able to theorize about the forms by looking at objects in the material world, and imagining what the "Perfect" tree, or "Perfect" man would be. The [[Aristotelian view of God]] grew from these Platonic roots, arguing that God was the Infinite, or the [[Unmoved mover]].

Hellenic Christians and their medieval successors then applied this Form-based philosophy to the Christian God. Philosophers took all the things that they considered good, Power, Love, Knowledge and Size, and posited that God was "infinite" in all these respects. They then concluded that God was [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipresence|omnipresent]] and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]]. Since God was perfect, any change would make him less than perfect, so they asserted that God was unchanging, or immutable.

[[Anselm of Canterbury]], a [[Archbishop of Canterbury|priest]],  [[Benedictine|monk]], and [[scholasticism|philosopher]] defined God as the "Being than which no greater can be conceived." Almost 200 years later, [[Thomas Aquinas]], in his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'', article 3, wrote succinctly: "By 'God', however, we mean some infinite good".

With the establishment of the formal church, the development of [[creed]]s and formal [[theology]], this view of [[God]] as Omni-Everything became nearly universal in the Christian World.

==Ontological argument==
[[Anselm of Canterbury]] composed the [[ontological argument]] for the existence of God, which he believed to be irrefutable. In essence, he argued that because God is, by definition, the being than which no greater can be conceived, and it is more perfect to exist than not to exist, God must exist. Conceiving God not to exist would be not conceiving God at all, as it would conceive a being less than perfect, which would not be God. Therefore, the argument proceeded, God could not be conceived not to exist.

The ontological argument is a defining example of the fusion of Hebrew and Greek thought. [[Philosophical realism]] was the dominant philosophical school of Anselm's day, and stemmed from [[Platonism]]. It held, in contrast to [[Nominalism]], that things such as "green" and "big" were known as [[problem of universals|universals]], which had a real existence in an abstract realm, as described by Plato. Accordingly, if a concept could be formed in the human mind, then it had a real existence in the abstract realm of the universals, apart from his imagination. In essence, if God could be imagined, God existed.

The ontological argument reflected the classical concept of "[[Perfection#Ontology and theology|perfections]]". Size, intelligence, beauty, power, benevolence, and so forth: all the qualities are called perfections. What is more intelligent is more perfect as regards intelligence, what is more beautiful is more perfect as regards beauty, and so forth. Because existence was more perfect than non-existence and God was, by definition, perfect, God existed by definition.

The Platonic concepts of realism, perfection and a god that defined as infinite thus became incorporated into Christian medieval philosophy.

      <comment>/* top */ Aristotle's thesis is exactly the thesis the Stoics complained about</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6513">'''Connexive logic''' names one class of alternative, or non-classical, logics designed to exclude the so-called [[paradoxes of material implication]]. (Other logical theories with the same agenda include [[relevance logic]], also known as relevant logic.) The characteristic that separates connexive logic from other non-classical logics is its rejection of Aristotle's Thesis, i.e. the formula,

* ~(~p → p)

as a [[logical truth]]. Aristotle's Thesis asserts that no statement [[Logical consequence|follows from]] its own denial. Stronger connexive logics also accept Boethius' Thesis,

* ((p → q) → ~(p → ~q))

which states that if a statement implies one thing, it does not imply its opposite.

==History==

Connexive logic is arguably one of the oldest approaches to logic. Aristotle's Thesis is named after [[Aristotle]] because he uses this principle in a passage in the ''Prior Analytics''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is impossible that the same thing should be necessitated by the being and the not-being of the same thing. I mean, for example, that it is impossible that B should necessarily be great if A is white, and that B should necessarily be great if A is not white. For if B is not great A cannot be white. But if, when A is not white, it is necessary that B should be great, it necessarily results that if B is not great, B itself is great. But this is impossible. ''An. Pr''. ii 4.57b3.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The sense of this passage is to perform a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' proof on the claim that two formulas, (A → B) and (~A → B), can be true simultaneously. The proof is,

# (A → B)         hypothesis
# (~A → B)        hypothesis
# (~B → ~A)       1, Transposition
# (~B → B)        2, 3, Hypothetical Syllogism

Aristotle then declares step 4 to be impossible, completing the ''reductio''. But if step 4 is impossible, it must be because Aristotle accepts its denial, ~(~B → B), as a logical truth.

Aristotelian [[syllogisms]] (as opposed to Boolean syllogisms) appear to be based on connexive principles. For example, the contrariety of A and E statements, "All S are P," and "No S are P," follows by a ''reductio ad absurdum'' argument similar to the one given by Aristotle.

Later logicians, notably [[Chrysippus]], are also thought to have endorsed connexive principles. By 100 C.E. logicians had divided into four or five distinct schools concerning the correct understanding of conditional ("if...then...") statements. [[Sextus Empiricus]] described one school as follows.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And those who introduce the notion of connexion say that a conditional is sound when the contradictory of its consequent is incompatible with its antecedent.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "connexivism" is derived from this passage (as translated by Kneale and Kneale).

It is believed that Sextus was here describing the school of Chrysippus. That this school accepted Aristotle's thesis seems clear because the definition of the conditional,

* (p → q)   =df   ~(p ° ~q) - where ° indicates compatibility,

requires that Aristotle's Thesis be a logical truth, provided we assume that every statement is compatible with itself, which seems fairly fundamental to the concept of compatibility.

The medieval philosopher [[Boethius]] also accepted connexive principles. In ''De Syllogismo Hypothetico'', he argues that from, "If A, then if B then C," and "If B then not-C," we may infer "not-A," by modus tollens. However, this follows only if the two statements, "If B then C," and "If B then not-C," are considered incompatible.

Since Aristotelian logic was the standard logic studied until the 19th Century, it could reasonably be claimed that connexive logic was the accepted school of thought among logicians for most of Western history. (Of course, logicians were not necessarily aware of belonging to the connexivist school.) However, in the 19th Century Boolean syllogisms, and a propositional logic based on truth-functions, became the standard. Since then, relatively few logicians have subscribed to connexivism. These few include E. J. Nelson and [[P. F. Strawson]].

==Connecting antecedent to consequent==

The objection that is made to the truth-functional definition of conditionals is that there is no requirement that the consequent ''actually follow'' from the antecedent. So long as the antecedent is false or the consequent true, the conditional is considered to be true whether there is any relation between the antecedent and the consequent or not. Hence, as the philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] once remarked, you can cut up a newspaper, sentence by sentence, put all the sentences in a hat, and draw any two at random. It is guaranteed that either the first sentence will imply the second, or vice versa. But when we use the words "if" and "then" we generally mean to assert that there is some relation between the antecedent and the consequent. What is the nature of that relationship? Relevance (or relevant) logicians take the view that, in addition to saying that the consequent cannot be false while the antecedent is true, the antecedent must be "relevant" to the consequent. At least initially, this means that there must be at least some terms (or variables) that appear in both the antecedent and the consequent. Connexivists generally claim instead that there must be some "real connection" between the antecedent and the consequent, such as might be the result of real class inclusion relations. For example, the class relations, "All men are mortal," would provide a real connection that would warrant the conditional, "If Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal." However, more remote connections, for example "If she apologized to him, then he lied to me," (suggested by Bennett) still defy connexivist analysis.

'''''Contact''''' is a 1997 American [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]]. It is a [[film adaptation]] of [[Carl Sagan]]'s 1985 [[Contact (novel)|novel of the same name]]; Sagan and his wife [[Ann Druyan]] wrote the story outline for the film.

[[Jodie Foster]] portrays the film's [[protagonist]], Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Arroway, a [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] scientist who finds strong evidence of [[extraterrestrial life]] and is chosen to make [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]]. The film also stars [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[James Woods]], [[Tom Skerritt]], [[William Fichtner]], [[John Hurt]], [[Angela Bassett]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Jake Busey]] and [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]].

Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan began working on the film in 1979. Together, they wrote a 100+ page [[film treatment]] and set up ''Contact'' at [[Warner Bros.]] with [[Peter Guber]] and [[Lynda Obst]] as producers. When [[development (film)|development]] stalled on the film, Sagan published ''Contact'' as a novel in 1985 and the film adaptation was rejuvenated in 1989. [[Roland Joffé]] and [[George Miller (producer)|George Miller]] had planned to direct it, but Joffé dropped out in 1993 and Warner Bros. fired Miller in 1995. Robert Zemeckis was eventually hired to direct and filming for ''Contact'' lasted from September 1996 to February 1997. [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] handled most of the visual effects sequences.

The film was released on July 11, 1997. ''Contact'' grossed approximately $171 million in worldwide [[box office]] totals. The film won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] and received multiple awards and nominations at the [[Saturn Award]]s.

==Plot==
Dr. Ellie Arroway works for the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] program at the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in Puerto Rico. Guided into science and communication by her now-deceased father, she listens to radio emissions from space, hoping to find evidence of [[Extraterrestrial life|alien life]]. David Drumlin, the president's science advisor, pulls the funding from SETI, because he believes the endeavor is futile. Arroway gains backing from secretive billionaire industrialist S.&amp;nbsp;R. Hadden's company, which allows her to continue the project at the [[Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array|Very Large Array]] in New Mexico.

Four years later, with Drumlin seeking to close SETI, Arroway discovers a signal repeating a sequence of prime numbers, apparently sent from the star system [[Vega]] some 26 [[light-years]] away. This announcement causes Drumlin and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] led by Michael Kitz to attempt to take control of the facility. Arroway's team then discover a second signal and find a video buried in the new signal: [[Adolf Hitler]]'s opening address at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin. Arroway and her team postulate that this would have been the first television signal strong enough to leave Earth's ionosphere, taking 26 years to reach Vega and then being transmitted back from there.

The project is put under tight security and its progress followed worldwide. Arroway learns that when the original frames of the Hitler video combined with the modified version shows that the signal also contains more than 63,000 pages of indecipherable data. The reclusive S. R. Hadden secretly meets on his airplane home with Arroway to provide the means to decode the pages, found when they are arranged in three dimensions rather than two-dimensional pages. The pages reveal schematics for a complex machine that is determined to be some kind of transport for a single occupant.

The nations of the world fund the construction of the machine at [[Cape Canaveral]]. An international panel is assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine. Although Arroway is a frontrunner to go, her hopes are scuppered by [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met and briefly became romantically involved with in [[Puerto Rico]]. When he brings attention to her [[atheism]], the panel selects Drumlin instead on the belief he would be more representative of humanity. However, on the day the machine is tested, a religious terrorist destroys the machine in a [[Suicide attack|suicide bombing]], killing Drumlin and dozens of others.

A cancer-stricken Hadden, now in residence on the [[Mir|Mir space station]], reveals to Arroway that his company had secretly made a second machine in Japan and that Arroway will be the one to go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, a sphere surrounded by a dodecahedron, which is then dropped into four rapidly spinning rings, causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of [[wormholes]]. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Pensacola, [[Florida]], and a figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just her first step to joining other spacefaring species.

Arroway falls unconscious as she begins traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens to find herself on the floor of the pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. A [[United States congressional committee|Congressional Committee]] is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In an online private conversation, Kitz and [[White House]] official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to increase the number of dishes at the [[Very Large Array|VLA]] from 27 to 72.

==Production==
===Development===
[[Carl Sagan]] conceived the idea for ''Contact'' in 1979. The same year, [[Lynda Obst]], one of Sagan's closest friends, was hired by film producer [[Peter Guber]] to be a [[studio executive]] for his [[production company]], Casablanca FilmWorks. She [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] Guber the idea for ''Contact'', who commissioned a development deal.&lt;ref name=making/&gt; Sagan and [[Ann Druyan]] (who later became his wife) wrote a 100+ page [[film treatment]], finishing in November 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= [[Carl Sagan]] | title = Contact: A Novel | publisher =[[Simon &amp; Schuster|Simon and Schuster]] | date = October 1985 | page = 432| isbn = 0-671-43400-4 | location = New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://contact-themovie.warnerbros.com/cmp/int-druyan.html | title = Ann Druyan | work = [[Warner Bros.]] | accessdate = 2009-02-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001018020435/http://contact-themovie.warnerbros.com/cmp/int-druyan.html |archivedate=2000-10-18 |quote=Carl and I wrote the more than 100-page treatment in November of 1980...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Druyan explained: {{cquote|Carl's and my dream was to write something that would be a fictional representation of what contact would actually be like, that would convey something of the true grandeur of the universe.}} They added the science and religion analogies as a metaphor of philosophical and intellectual interest in searching for the truth of both humanity and alien contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://contact-themovie.warnerbros.com/cmp/about.html | title = About the production | work = [[Warner Bros.]] | accessdate = 2009-01-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010517053600/http://contact-themovie.warnerbros.com/cmp/about.html |archivedate=2001-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan incorporated [[Kip Thorne]]'s study of [[wormhole]] space travel into the screenplay.&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt; The characterization of Dr. Ellie Arroway was inspired by Dr. [[Jill Tarter]], head of [[Project Phoenix (SETI)|Project Phoenix]] of the [[SETI Institute]]; Jodie Foster researched the lead role by meeting her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = William J. Broad | title = Astronomers Revive Scan of the Heavens for Signs of Life | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1998-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarter  served as a consultant on the story, realistically portraying struggling careers of women scientists from the 1950s to 1970s. The writers debated whether Arroway should have a baby at the film's end.&lt;ref name=cinema&gt;{{cite book | author= Norman Kagan | title = The Cinema of Robert Zemeckis | publisher = Taylor Trade Publishing | year = 2003 | pages = 159–181 | isbn = 0-87833-293-6 | chapter = Contact | location = [[Lanham, Maryland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Guber was impressed with Sagan and Druyan's treatment, he hired various screenwriters to rewrite the script. New characters were added, one of them  a Native American [[park ranger]]-turned-astronaut.&lt;ref name=making/&gt; Guber suggested that Arroway have an estranged teenage son, who he believed would add more depth to the storyline. Guber said: {{cquote|Here was a woman consumed with the idea that there was something out there worth listening to, but the one thing she could never make contact with was her own child. To me, that's what the film had to be about.}}&lt;ref name=making/&gt; Sagan and Druyan disagreed with Guber's idea and it was not incorporated into the storyline. In 1982, Guber took ''Contact'' to [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and with the film's [[development (film)|development]] stalled, Sagan started to turn his original idea into a [[Contact (novel)|novel]], which was published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster|Simon and Schuster]] in September 1985. The film adaptation remained in development and Guber eventually vacated his position at [[Warner Bros.]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=making/&gt;

Guber became the new president of [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] and tried to purchase the [[film rights]] of ''Contact'' from Warner, but the studio refused. Coincidentally, in 1989, Obst was hired as a new executive at Warner and began to fast track the film, by hiring more writers.&lt;ref name=making/&gt; [[Roland Joffé]] was eventually hired to direct,&lt;ref name=Ro/&gt; using a screenplay by [[James V. Hart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Bernard Weinraub | title =  Using a Big Budget To Ask Big Questions | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1997-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joffé almost commenced [[pre-production]] before he dropped out&lt;ref name=Ro/&gt; and Obst then hired [[Michael Goldenberg]] to rewrite the script, who finished his second draft&lt;ref name=making/&gt; in late 1993. Goldenberg's second draft rekindled Warner Bros.' interest in ''Contact''&lt;ref name=Ro/&gt; and [[Robert Zemeckis]] was offered the chance to direct, but he turned down the opportunity&lt;ref name=making/&gt; in favor of making a film based on the life of [[Harry Houdini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116677042 | title = Verhoeven eyes 'Houdini' | date = 1997-07-10 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zemeckis recalled: {{cquote|The first script [for ''Contact''] I saw was great until the last page and a half... and then it had the sky open up and these angelic aliens putting on a light show and I said, 'That's just not going to work.'&lt;ref name=making/&gt;}}

In December 1993, Warner Bros. hired [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] to direct&lt;ref name=Ro&gt;{{cite news | author = John Evan Frook | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR116846 | title = WB makes 'Contact' | date = 1993-12-16 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Contact'' commenced pre-production. Miller cast [[Jodie Foster]] in the lead role, approached [[Ralph Fiennes]] to play Palmer Joss and also considered casting [[Linda Hunt]] as the [[President of the United States]]. In addition to having aliens put on a [[laser lighting display]] around Earth, another version of the Goldenberg scripts had an alien wormhole swallow up the planet, transporting Earth to the center of the galaxy. Miller also asked Goldenberg to rewrite ''Contact'' in an attempt to portray the [[Pope]] as a key supporting character. Warner Bros. was hoping to have the film ready for release by Christmas 1996, but under Miller's direction pre-production lasted longer than expected.&lt;ref name=making/&gt;  The studio fired the director, blaming pushed-back start dates, budget concerns, and Miller's insistence that the script needed five more weeks of rewriting. Robert Zemeckis, who previously turned down the director's position, decided to accept the offer. Warner Bros. granted Zemeckis total [[artistic control]] and the right of [[final cut privilege]].&lt;ref name=making/&gt; The director cast Matthew McConaughey as Palmer Joss; McConaughey dropped out of the lead role in ''[[The Jackal (1997 film)|The Jackal]]'' to take the role in ''Contact''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117465974 | title = McConaughey inks with WB | date = 1996-12-16 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being diagnosed with [[Myelodysplastic syndrome|myelodysplasia]] in 1994, Sagan continued to be involved in the production of the film. For the cast and main crew members, he conducted an [[academic conference]] that depicted a detailed history of [[astronomy]].&lt;ref name=making/&gt;

During the development of ''Contact'', the production crew watched [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) for inspiration.&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:ContactLoco.jpg|thumb|right|Concept drawing of early NASA site idea]]
[[Principal photography]] began on September 24, 1996, and ended on February 28, 1997. The first shooting took place at the [[Very Large Array]] (VLA) near [[Socorro, New Mexico]]. "Shooting at the VLA was, of course, spectacular but also one of the most difficult aspects of our filming," producer [[Steve Starkey]] said. "It is a working facility, so in order for us to accomplish shots for the movie, we had to negotiate with the [[National Science Foundation]] for 'dish control' in order to move the dishes in the direction we needed to effect the most dramatic shot for the story."&lt;ref name=Tech&gt;{{cite web | url = http://contact-themovie.warnerbros.com/cmp/technology.html | title = Contact – High Technology Lends a Hand/Science of the Soundstage | publisher = [[Warner Bros.]] | accessdate = 2009-01-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010304211755/http://contact-themovie.warnerbros.com/cmp/technology.html |archivedate=2001-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After arduous first weeks of [[location shooting]] in New Mexico and [[Arizona]], production for ''Contact'' returned to Los Angeles for five months' worth of location and [[sound stage]] shooting that used a total of nine soundstages at Warner Bros.&amp;nbsp;Studios in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], and [[Culver Studios]]. All together, the [[art department]] created more than 25 [[Set construction|sets]].&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt;

In an attempt to create a sense of realism for the storyline, principal [[CNN]] news outlet commentators were scripted into ''Contact''. More than 25 news reporters from CNN had roles in the film and the CNN programs ''[[Larry King Live]]'' and ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'' were also included. [[Ann Druyan]] makes a [[cameo appearance]] as herself, debating with Rob Lowe's character, Richard Rank, on ''Crossfire''. In January 1997, a [[second unit]] was sent to [[Puerto Rico]] for one week at the [[Arecibo Observatory]].

Other second unit work took place in Fiji and Newfoundland, [[Canada]]. Also essential to the production were a host of technical consultants from the [[SETI Institute]], the [[California Institute of Technology]], the VLA and a former [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House staff member]] to consult on [[Washington D.C.]] and government protocol issues.&lt;ref name=strange&gt;{{cite web | url = http://contact-themovie.warnerbros.com/cmp/neworlds.html | title = Creating Strange New Worlds | work = [[Warner Bros.]] | accessdate = 2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan visited the set a number of times, where he also helped with last-minute rewrites. Filming was briefly delayed with the news of his death on December 20, 1996. ''Contact'' was dedicated to Sagan: "For Carl" comes on the screen at the fade.&lt;ref name=making/&gt;

Cinematographer [[Don Burgess (cinematographer)|Don Burgess]] shot the film in [[anamorphic format]] using [[Panavision]] cameras as well as using large format 65mm and [[VistaVision]] for special effects shots. The [[sound design]]ers used [[Pro Tools]] software for the [[audio mixing (film and television)|audio mixing]], which was done at [[Skywalker Sound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Richard Buskin | url = http://www.filmsound.org/randythom/contact.htm | title = Making Contact | work = FilmSound.org | accessdate = 2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual effects===
[[File:Contact-Machine.jpg|thumb|right|The film's (second) Machine in operation at [[Hokkaido|Hokkaidō]], Japan]]
Designing ''Contact''{{'}}s visual effects sequences was a joint effort among eight separate VFX companies. This team included [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[Weta Digital]], [[George Lucas]]' [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]], and [[Effects Associates]], with [[Pixar]]'s [[RenderMan (software)|RenderMan]] used for CGI rendering. Weta Digital, in particular, was responsible for designing the [[wormhole]] sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Ian Pryor | title = Peter Jackson: From Prince of Splatter to Lord of the Rings | publisher =[[Thomas Dunne Books]] | year =2003 | page = 206 | isbn = 0-312-32294-1 | location = New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jodie Foster admitted she had difficulty with [[chroma key|blue screen]] technology because it was a first for the actress. "It was a blue room. Blue walls, blue roof. It was just blue, blue, blue," Foster explained. "And I was rotated on a [[Lazy Susan]] with the camera moving on a computerized arm. It was really tough."&lt;ref name=making/&gt;

News footage of then-President [[Bill Clinton]] was digitally altered to make it appear as if he is speaking about alien contact. This was not the original plan for the film;&lt;ref name=making/&gt; Zemeckis had initially approached [[Sidney Poitier]] to play the president, but the actor turned the role down in favor of ''[[The Jackal (1997 film)|The Jackal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Army Archerd]] | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862965 | title = Two 'Titanics' on collision course | date = 1996-08-16 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Poitier's refusal, Zemeckis saw a [[NASA]] announcement in August 1996. "Clinton gave his [[Allan Hills 84001|Mars rock]] speech," the director explained, "and I swear to God it was like it was scripted for this movie. When he said the line 'We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say,' I almost died. I stood there with my mouth hanging open."&lt;ref name=making/&gt;

One notable feature of ''Contact'' is its use of digital [[color correction]]. This approach helped solve [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] errors during the location shooting at the [[Very Large Array]] in New Mexico. "The weather killed us, so we were going back in and changing it enough so that the skies and colors and times of day all seem roughly the same," [[visual effects supervisor]] Ken Ralston commented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Mallory | url = http://www.variety.com/vstory/VR1117341655 | title = Invisible tricks of the trade | date = 1997-05-08 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening scene is a three-minute [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] sequence, beginning with a view of Earth from high in the exosphere and listening in on numerous radio waves of modern programming emitting from the planet. The camera then starts zooming backward, passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the [[Oort cloud]], [[interstellar space]], the [[Local Bubble]], the [[Milky Way]], other galaxies of the [[Local Group]], and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance these signals would have traveled at the speed of light, eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie's eye as she is listening on her amateur radio. This scale view shot of the entire universe was inspired by the short documentary film ''[[Powers of Ten (film)|Powers of Ten]]'' (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Tim Dirks | url = http://www.filmsite.org/visualeffects19.html | title = Milestones in Film History: Greatest Visual and Special Effects and Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) - Part 16 | work = [[Filmsite.org]] | accessdate = 2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One sequence, with young Ellie running upstairs to try to retrieve her father's medicine, appears to have Ellie running just behind a camera as they move into the bathroom, but the shot resolves to show that this had been part of the medicine cabinet's mirror reflection, pulling back to have Ellie open it. This sequence is noted as one of the film's most impressive visual effects due to the seamlessness of the transition. According to Carin-Anne Strohmaier, the first assistant film editor, the shot was created through three different [[Photographic plate|plates]], digitally manipulated in CGI to create the effect: one plate was from the cameraman leading Ellie, the second of Ellie opening the cabinet door (which was a blue screen instead of a miror), and the third of the reflection of Ellie and her dad when the door closes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slashfilm.com/contact-mirror-shot/ | title = You Probably Didn't Notice This Shot in 'Contact' Was Done with Visual Effects | first = Ethan | last = Anderton | date = January 17, 2017 | accessdate = January 9, 2018 | work = [[/Film]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, they had planned to use an effect similar to [[bullet time]] from ''[[The Matrix]]'' to show Ellie's father stopped in time as he dies, but as the movie was being filmed, they found that this approach would not fit the casting or direction the film was going, but they still wanted something that the audience would recognize as off-putting and without having to show Ellie's dad, leading to the development of this mirror sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://vfxblog.com/2017/07/10/the-famous-mirror-shot-in-contact-was-almost-something-else-entirely/ | title = The famous mirror shot in 'Contact' was almost something else entirely | first = Ian | last = Failes | date = July 10, 2017 | accessdate = January 9, 2018 | work = [[VGX Blog]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decoding of the extraterrestrial message, with its architectural drawings of the machine, was created by Ken Ralston and Sony Pictures Imageworks. This is the sixth film collaboration between director Zemeckis and VFX supervisor Ralston. Imageworks created more than 350 visual effects shots, using a combination of model and miniature shots and digital computer work. On designing the Machine, Zemeckis explained that "The Machine in Sagan's novel was somewhat vague, which is fine for a book. In a movie, though, if you're going to build a giant physical structure of alien design, you have to make it believable." He continued that "it had to be huge, so that the audience would feel like it was bigger than man should be tinkering with. It had to look absolutely real."&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt; The machine was then designed by concept artist Steve Burg, reusing a conceptual design he had originally created to appear as the "Time Displacement Device" in [[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|''Terminator 2'']] in a scene that did not make the final cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steveburg.com/film_tv.html|title=Steve Burg homepage|accessdate=2009-09-09|work=Steve Burg|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215063502/http://www.steveburg.com/film_tv.html|archivedate=December 15, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early conceptual designs of the Pod itself were based, as it existed in the novel, on one of the primary shapes in geometry, a [[dodecahedron]], or a twelve-sided figure. Eventually the Pod was modified to a spherical capsule that encases the traveler. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the [[Kennedy Space Center]] at [[Merritt Island]] adjacent to [[Cape Canaveral]], where officials allowed them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39]] before the launch of the space shuttle.&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt; There, they concentrated on the mechanics of the elevator and the gantry area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod itself, the interior of the elevator, and the gantry, which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt;

The climactic scene depicting the mysterious beach near the galactic core where Arroway makes contact, in particular, called for major visual innovations. The goal was an idyllic seashore with a sky blazing with stars that might exist near the core of the galaxy. Ralston said that "the thought was that this beach would have a heightened reality. One that might make the everyday world seem like a vague daydream."&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt; To keep the question alive whether any of it was real in Arroway's mind, elements such as ocean waves running in reverse and palm tree shadows swaying with sped-up motion were applied.&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;

The Hitler newsreel also required digital manipulation.&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;

==Themes==

===Science and religion===
''Contact'' often suggests that cultural conflicts between religion and science would be brought to the fore by the apparent contact with aliens that occurs in the film. A  point of discussion is the [[existence of God]], with several different positions being portrayed.&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt; A description of an emotionally intense [[religious experience|experience]] by Palmer Joss, which he describes as seeing God, is met by Arroway's suggestion that "some part of [him] needed to have it"—that it was a significant personal experience but indicative of nothing greater. Joss compares his certainty that God exists to Arroway's certainty that she loved her deceased father, despite her being unable to prove it.&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;

''Contact'' depicts intense debate occurring as a result of the apparent contact with aliens. Many clips of well-known debate shows such as ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'' and ''[[Larry King Live]]'' are shown, with participants discussing the implications of the message, asking whether it is proof of the existence of alien life or of God, and whether science is encroaching upon religious ground by, as one believer puts it, "talking to your god for you."&lt;ref name=comment/&gt; The head of a religious organization casts doubt on the morality of building the machine, noting: "We don't even know whether [the aliens] believe in God." The first machine is ultimately destroyed by a religious extremist, in the belief that building it was detrimental to humankind.&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;

Although the revelation at the end of the film that Arroway's recording device recorded approximately 18 hours of static is arguably conclusive proof of the fact of—if not the experience of—her "journey", several coincidences and indications throughout the film cast doubt on its authenticity. Director Robert Zemeckis indicated: "The point of the movie is for there always to be a certain amount of doubt [as to whether the aliens were real]."&lt;ref name=comment/&gt; These indications consist mostly of visual cues during the "journey" that echo Ellie's experiences earlier in the film (which Ellie believed to be the result of the aliens "downloading [her] thoughts and memories"), but the timing of the message's arrival and its eventual decoding are also highly coincidental: the message was first received shortly before Arroway and her team were to be ejected from the VLA facility and was successfully decoded only by S.R. Hadden (Arroway's only sponsor, who was close to death from cancer) after weeks of failed attempts by the team at the VLA.&lt;ref name=comment/&gt;

At the end of the film, Arroway is put into a position that she had traditionally viewed with skepticism and contempt: that of believing something with complete certainty, despite being unable to prove it in the face of not only widespread incredulity and skepticism (which she admits that as a scientist she would normally share) but also evidence apparently to the contrary.&lt;ref name=comment/&gt;

Zemeckis stated that he intended the message of the film to be that science and religion can coexist rather than being opposing camps,&lt;ref name=comment&gt;[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Steve Starkey]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 1997, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; as shown by the coupling of scientist Arroway with the religious Joss, as well as his acceptance that the "journey" indeed took place. This, and scattered references throughout the film, posit that science and religion are not nominally incompatible: one interviewer, after asking Arroway whether the construction of the machine—despite not knowing what will happen when it is activated—is too dangerous, suggests that it is being built on the "faith" that the alien designers, as Arroway puts it, "know what they're doing."&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;

===Critical reception===
On the basis of 63 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 62% of critics gave positive reviews, with an average score of 6.8/10.&lt;ref name="Tom"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1078021-contact/ | title = Contact (1997) | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Fandango Media]] | accessdate = July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] calculated an average score of 62 out of 100, based on 23 reviews, denoting "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="meta"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/contact | title = Contact Reviews | work = [[Metacritic]] | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate = February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] said ''Contact'' was on par with [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977) as Hollywood's most cinematic study of extraterrestrial life. "Movies like ''Contact'' help explain why movies like ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' leave me feeling empty and unsatisfied," Ebert commented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Roger Ebert]] | title = Contact | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = 1997-07-11 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970711/REVIEWS/707110301/1023 | accessdate = 2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 2011, Ebert added ''Contact'' to his "Great Movies" collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111221/REVIEWS08/111229996/1004 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Contact (1997)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said the film carried a more philosophical portrait of the science fiction genre than did other films, but still managed "to satisfy the cravings of the general public who simply want to be entertained".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Kenneth Turan]] |title=Foster Passes Hearing Test |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie970711-7,2,1181836.story |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1997-07-11 |accessdate=2009-01-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120065458/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie970711-7%2C2%2C1181836.story |archivedate=November 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet reviewer [[James Berardinelli]] said ''Contact'' is "one of 1997's finest motion pictures, and is a forceful reminder that Hollywood is still capable of making magic." Berardinelli felt the film was on par with [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) to be one of the greatest science fiction films ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[James Berardinelli]] | title = Contact | url = http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/c/contact.html | work = ReelViews.net | accessdate = 2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' largely enjoyed the first 90 minutes of ''Contact'' but felt that director Robert Zemeckis was too obsessed with visual effects rather than cohesive storytelling for the pivotal [[climax (narrative)|climax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Mick LaSalle]] | title = Anybody There? | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/07/11/DD67803.DTL | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date = 1997-07-11 | accessdate = 2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rita Kempley, writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', did not like the film's main premise, which she described as "a preachy debate between sanctity and science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Rita Kempley | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/review97/contactkempley.htm | title = Contact | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 1997-07-11 | accessdate = 2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Bill Clinton===
A meteorite was [[Allan Hills 84001|found in Antarctica in 1984]], thought to be from [[Mars]]. Twelve years later, a paper by [[David S. McKay|a NASA scientist]] was published in the journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], proposing that the meteorite might contain evidence for microscopic fossils of Martian bacteria (later, a disputed interpretation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After 10 years, few believe life on Mars|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2006-08-06-mars-life_x.htm|last=Crenson|first=Matt|publisher=Associated Press (on usatoday.com)|date=2006-08-06|accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKay|first=David S.|authorlink=|year=1996|title=Search for Past Life on Mars: Possible Relic Biogenic Activity in Martian Meteorite ALH84001|journal=Science|pmid=8688069|volume=273|issue=5277|pages=924–930|doi=10.1126/science.273.5277.924|url=|accessdate=|quote=|bibcode = 1996Sci...273..924M |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement made headlines around the world and the following day, on August 7, 1996, the President of the United States, [[Bill Clinton]], made remarks about the news at a press conference that were, in places, sufficiently generic in nature to allow fragments of his videotaped statement to be included in ''Contact'', implying that Clinton was speaking about contact with extraterrestrial life, congruent with the film's story:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criticalcommons.org/Members/ccManager/clips/the-real-adolf-hitler-and-the-real-bill-clinton-in-contact  The real Adolf Hitler and the real Bill Clinton in Contact] (Video from ''Contact'', and commentary) Critical Commons. Retrieved: 2013-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Good afternoon. I'm glad to be joined by my science and technology adviser ...''[words cut by film editors]''... This is the product of years of exploration ...''[words cut]''... by some of the world's most distinguished scientists. Like all discoveries, this one will and should continue to be reviewed, examined, and scrutinized. It must be confirmed by other scientists. But clearly, the fact that something of this magnitude is being explored is another vindication ...''[film scene performed over recording, with dialogue obscuring Clinton's remarks and creating a gap]''... If this discovery is confirmed, it will surely be one of the most stunning insights into our universe that science has ever uncovered. Its implications are as far reaching and awe inspiring as can be imagined. Even as it promises answers to some of our oldest questions, it poses still others even more fundamental. We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say as we continue the search for answers and for knowledge that is as old as humanity itself but essential to our people's future. Thank you.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=53170 Remarks on the Possible Discovery of Life on Mars and an Exchange With Reporters] William J. Clinton at The American Presidency Project, 1996-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later in the film, a separate fragment of generic remarks by President Clinton, speaking about [[Saddam Hussein]] and Iraq at a different press conference in October 1994, was lifted out of context and inserted into ''Contact'':

{{quote|I would encourage you not to inflame this situation beyond the facts. Let us deal with this on the facts. We are monitoring what has actually happened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=49247 The President's News Conference] William J. Clinton at The American Presidency Project, 1994-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On July 14, 1997, three days after the film opened in the United States, Warner Bros. received a letter from [[White House Counsel]] [[Charles Ruff]] protesting against the use of Clinton's digitally-composited appearance. The letter made no demands, but called the duration and manner of Clinton's appearance "inappropriate". No legal action was planned; the White House Counsel simply wanted to send a message to Hollywood to avoid unauthorized uses of the President's image. Zemeckis was reminded that official White House policy "prohibits the use of the President in any way ... (that) implies a direct ... connection between the President and a commercial product or service."&lt;ref name=Willy/&gt;

A Warner Bros. spokeswoman explained that "we feel we have been completely frank and upfront with the White House on this issue. They saw scripts, they were notified when the film was completed, they were sent a print well in advance of the film's July 11 opening, and we have confirmation that a print was received there July 2." However, Warner Bros. did concede that they never pursued or received formal release from the White House for the use of Clinton's image. While the Counsel commented that parody and satire are protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], press secretary [[Mike McCurry (press secretary)|Mike McCurry]] believed that "there is a difference when the President's image, which is his alone to control, is used in a way that would lead the viewer to believe he has said something he really didn't say."&lt;ref name=Willy/&gt;

===CNN===
Shortly after the White House's complaint, [[CNN]] chairman, president, and CEO [[Tom Johnson (journalist)|Tom Johnson]] announced he believed that in hindsight it was a mistake to allow 13 members of CNN's on-air staff (including [[Larry King]] and [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]]) to appear in the film, even though both CNN and Warner Bros. are owned by [[Time Warner]]. Johnson added that, for ''Contact'', the CNN presence "creates the impression that we're manipulated by Time Warner, and it blurs the line." CNN then changed their policies for future films, which now requires potential appearances to be cleared through their ethics group.&lt;ref name=Willy&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116676904 | title = Cameo crisis on 'Contact' | date = 1997-07-15 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuits===
Director [[George Miller (producer)|George Miller]], who had developed ''Contact'' with Warner Bros. before Zemeckis' hiring, unsuccessfully sued the studio over [[breach of contract]] policies.&lt;ref name=making/&gt;

During filming on December 28, 1996, filmmaker [[Francis Ford Coppola]] filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. and Sagan, who had died the previous week.&lt;ref name=Cope/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt; Coppola claimed that Sagan's novel was based on a story the pair had developed for a [[television special]]&lt;ref name=diss/&gt; back in 1975,&lt;ref name=Cope/&gt; titled ''First Contact''. Under their development agreement,&lt;ref name=diss/&gt; Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project, as well as from any novel Sagan would write, with [[American Zoetrope]] and [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop Productions]]. The TV program was never produced, but in 1985, Simon and Schuster published ''Contact'' and Warner moved forward with development of a film adaptation. Coppola sought at least $250,000 in compensatory damages and an injunction against production or distribution of the film.&lt;ref name=Cope&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | url = http://www.variety.com/vstory/VR1117436227 | title = Zoetrope sues over 'Contact' | date = 1996-12-30 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres dismissed Coppola's claim. Although Torres agreed that Sagan violated some terms of the contract, he explained that Coppola waited too long to file his lawsuit, and that the contract might not be enforceable as it was written. Coppola then [[appeal]]ed his suit,&lt;ref name=diss&gt;{{cite news | author = Paul Karon | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117467799 | title = Coppola's 'Contact' claim is dismissed | date = 1998-02-17 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking it to the [[California Courts of Appeal]] (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola's claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted that it was not until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over ''Contact''.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;{{cite news | author = Janet Shprintz | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117780544 | title = Coppola loses 'Contact' | date = 2000-02-13 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NASA===
The scene where the [[NASA]] scientists give Arroway the "[[Suicide pill|cyanide pill]]" caused some controversy during production and when the film came out. [[Gerald D. Griffin]], the film's NASA advisor, insisted that NASA has never given any astronaut a cyanide pill "just in case," and that if an astronaut truly wished to commit suicide in space, all he or she would have to do is cut off their oxygen supply.&lt;ref name=comment/&gt; However, Carl Sagan insisted that NASA did indeed give out cyanide pills and they did it for every mission an astronaut has ever flown. Zemeckis said that because of the two radically different assertions, the truth is unknown, but he left the suicide pill scene in the movie as it seemed more suspenseful that way and it was also in line with Sagan's beliefs and vision of the film.&lt;ref name=comment/&gt;  Along with being NASA Technical Consultant for the project, Griffin had a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in the role of "Dynamics" in Mission Control.  He had previously been technical advisor for Ron Howard's 1995 film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]''.  While working for NASA during the [[Apollo Program]], he had been the actual flight director for that mission, among others, and during the 1980s was the director of the [[Johnson Space Center]].

'''Dirk Hendrik Theodoor Vollenhoven''' (1 November 1892, [[Amsterdam]] – 6 June 1978, Amsterdam) was a Dutch philosopher.

==Life history and early work==
Vollenhoven was born in [[Amsterdam]], son of Dirk Hendrik Vollenhoven and Catharina Pruijs. His father was a custom-house officer of telegraphy in Amsterdam. In 1911, Vollenhoven registered in two faculties at the [[Vrije Universiteit]] in Amsterdam, the Faculty of Theology and the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy, and obtained his PhD in philosophy (''cum laude'') in 1918. He was a pastor of the [[Calvinism|Reformed Churches]], first in [[Oostkapelle]], 1918-1921, then in [[The Hague]], 1921-1926. He was appointed professor of philosophy at the Vrije Universiteit in 1926, and retired in 1963. On 10 October 1918 he married Hermina Maria Dooyeweerd (1892-1973). They had five children, two girls and three boys.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. J. Stellingwerff, ''D.H.Th. Vollenhoven (1892-1978) Reformator der Wijsbegeerte'' (Baarn: Ten Have, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Vollenhoven was a person who combined direct clarity with deep insight. He had an analytical mind that mastered many distinctions. He was pious, modest, obliging, and dedicated in his many tasks. In the faculty of Arts and Philosophy he gave, from 1926 till 1954, all the courses in philosophy: [[history of philosophy]], [[Philosophical method|general systematic philosophy]], [[logic]], and [[theoretical psychology]] (the latter was considered to be a philosophical discipline at the time), and also the mandatory introduction to philosophy for first-year students of all the faculties.
While preparing his dissertation on the influence of philosophy on mathematics and the natural sciences, Vollenhoven preached practically every Sunday, thereby becoming a well-known figure in the Reformed Churches. A year before gaining his PhD both his father and his supervisor and tutor, J. Woltjer, died. G.H.J.W.J. Geesink stepped in to supervise the completion of the thesis (now with restricted topic), entitled: “The philosophy of mathematics from a theistic standpoint.”&lt;ref&gt;This is the translated title of D.H.Th. Vollenhoven, ''De Wijsbegeerte der Wiskunde van Theïstisch Standpunt'' (Amsterdam: G. van Soest, 1918), 444 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt; The Amsterdam mathematician, [[Gerrit Mannoury]], whom Vollenhoven had critically described as being “the most consequential formalist and communistic pragmatist,” responded sympathetically to the dissertation by saying that Vollenhoven had taken a path “that had not been blazed by anyone before,” and that he did this “neither as theologian nor as mathematician, but as one who cherished his faith, yet without despising thought.”&lt;ref&gt;G. Mannoury, [Review of] “De Wijsbegeerte der Wiskunde van Theïstisch Standpunt,” ''De Beweging. Algemeen Maandschrift voor Letteren, Kunst, Wetenschap en Staatkunde'' (15, June 1919), pp. 373-374.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the parsonage in Oostkapelle, and later in The Hague, Vollenhoven performed his duties conscientiously, but he also continued his study of philosophy. In 1920 he received a scholarship and leave of absence to study psychology under [[Felix Krueger]] for five months in Leipzig. In the early 1920s [[Neo-Kantianism]] was the dominant school in the Netherlands. In philosophy Vollenhoven sought the reconciliation of thought and being, mediated theistically, with the priority given to being. In about mid-1922 this was radicalized: knowing (and thought) is a part of being. Neo-Kantianism, contrariwise, took its departure from thought and justified this in humanistic fashion. In other words, Vollenhoven rowed against the main current of his time. His many commitments and interests led to his becoming overworked. In (mid-)January 1923 he suffered a mental collapse, the recuperation took up most of that year.

==Vollenhoven and Dooyeweerd==
In the meantime Vollenhoven’s brother-in-law, chess mate, and former study chum [[Herman Dooyeweerd]] became active in philosophy. He visited Vollenhoven in Oostkapelle to discuss how he might work his way into philosophy more methodically. When both lived in The Hague, their discussions became more intense and searching, and an enduring partnership in philosophy developed that lasted a life-time. Yet their personalities were very different: Vollenhoven, with his analytical disposition, was the organizer, systematic thinker, and man of detailed historical overviews; Dooyeweerd, with his musical talent (he was a fine pianist), was a jurist by training, who sought the grand design. Vollenhoven had worked his way into the problems of mathematics, the natural sciences, biology, psychology, epistemology, and theology, while Dooyeweerd had a good command of sociology, economics, and jurisprudence. From the end of 1923 on, both advanced a “reformed philosophy” (what they referred to as “Calvinistic philosophy,” now usually called [[Reformational philosophy]]). They were simultaneously appointed to university chairs at the [[Vrije Universiteit]] of Amsterdam in 1926, Dooyeweerd in the Juridical Faculty, Vollenhoven in the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy as the successor of Geesink.&lt;ref&gt;Their inaugural addresses have the format of small books. H. Dooyeweerd, ''De Beteekenis der Wetsidee voor Rechtswetenschap en Rechtsphilosophie'' (Kampen: Kok, 15 October 1926), 112 pgs. D.H.Th. Vollenhoven, ''Logos en Ratio, beider verhouding in de geschiedenis der Westersche kentheorie'' (Kampen: Kok, 26 October 1926), 77 pgs. An English translation of the latter work, including an introduction, is expected to appear in 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

As professor, Vollenhoven was exacting but also exploratory and eager to pursue new avenues. Towards his students he was pastorally mild and sympathetic, which won him popularity and respect. In 1929 he became president of the university’s alumni organization and in 1930 an honorary member of the student fraternity. Also in 1930 the Calvinistic Student Movement (in Dutch: CSB) was formed, which often called on Vollenhoven for advice and invited him as speaker. From about this time more intense contact took place with [[Klaas Schilder]]. Schilder was a Reformed theologian, who played a dominant role in the split in the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands in 1944, a development much lamented by Vollenhoven.&lt;ref&gt;The Vollenhoven-Schilder correspondence has been published by W.G. de Vries, ed., ''Eender en Anders. Correspondentie tussen K. Schilder en D.H.Th. Vollenhoven'' (Kampen: Kok, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==A new anthropology==
After his illness in 1923, Vollenhoven began openly to criticize the dogma of the [[Christian mortalism#Immortality of the soul|immortality of the soul]]. This was first initiated by A. Janse, a self-taught elementary school principal with whom Vollenhoven struck up a friendship. In “The first questions of psychology” (1929), a published lecture, Vollenhoven explained that the [[soul]], as usually understood, is not an immortal substance but rather the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as a function of the human being, which operates within an aspect (or “law-sphere”) of reality. He took the soul itself to be the central unity of the heart of the human being. Vollenhoven had no enemies, but he did gain his first opponents in this connection among psychologists, in particular Jan Waterink, who defended the distinct reality of body, soul, and spirit.

The syllabus for the introductory course to philosophy, entitled ''Isagôgè Philosophiae'' (1930), was the first document to summarize the new “[[Reformational philosophy]].”&lt;ref&gt;The translated version is based on the final text of 1945. D.H.Th. Vollenhoven, ''Introduction to Philosophy'', ed. by John H. Kok and Anthony Tol, trans. by John H. Kok, with a Preface by Calvin Seerveld and a Foreword by Anthony Tol (Sioux Center, Iowa: Dordt College Press, 2005), 163 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt; (Vollenhoven always referred to it as “Calvinistic philosophy,” a term he first used in his inaugural address of 1926.) It attracted many and led to the formation of a distinct school in philosophy. In his Vice-Chancellor’s oration, given during his term (1932-1933) as Vice-Chancellor of the university, he discussed “The necessity of a Christian logic.”&lt;ref&gt;D.H.Th. Vollenhoven, ''De Noodzakelijkheid eener Christelijke Logica'' (Amsterdam: H.J. Paris, 1932), 110 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt; Vollenhoven criticized the so-called “neutrality” of logic. The latter uses logic as mere instrument of analysis, guided by the epistemological subject, rather than viewing logic as contributing substantively to the understanding through its principles. When shortly afterwards Vollenhoven’s book appeared, ''Calvinism and the Reformation of Philosophy'' (1933),&lt;ref&gt;D.H.Th. Vollenhoven, ''Het Calvinisme en de Reformatie van de Wijsbegeerte'' (Amsterdam: H.J. Paris, 1933), 319 pgs and 28 pages of notes.&lt;/ref&gt; this clarified his program, but it also elicited criticism (from H.H. Kuyper, V. Hepp), especially regarding Vollenhoven’s opposition to [[scholasticism]]. In response Vollenhoven displayed perseverance without becoming polemical: “We must not seek conflict but work constructively.”

While Vollenhoven and Dooyeweerd worked in close cooperation, each retained his independence. Dooyeweerd defended Reformational philosophy from the standpoint of a transcendental critique. This critique sought to expose the dependence of thought, particularly theoretical thought, on religion. Vollenhoven was keener on setting out the viable religious presuppositions of any understanding of reality.

==A unique ontology==
For example, in [[ontology]] Vollenhoven opposed the notion of a concept of being that encompasses God, [[cosmos]], and the human being. Vollenhoven’s primary distinction was that of the [[Trinity]], who ''is'', the law for the cosmos that ''holds'', and the created cosmos, which is entirely ''sustained'' by God. In connection with the cosmos, different fundamental aspects (“law-spheres”) are distinguished—fifteen of which have been made explicit—in which creatures function. As to the human being, outwardly its functions are “structured throughout,” inwardly there is the direction-determining soul or heart, “out of which are the issues of life.” The law, which in a generic sense forms a boundary limit for created reality, involves a three-fold specification: (i) there is the ''creation command'' (the “[[Let there be light|let there be …”]] of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1) relevant to “the origination, structure, whereby is implicit its modal diversity [of law-spheres], and the internal development of each kingdom”; (ii) the ''love command'', which “concerns the [moral] direction of human life in its relation to God and fellow human being”; and (iii) the ''positive laws'', which “bridge the love command and the concrete situation” in need of regulation “in light of society’s purpose, historical phase, and geographical location.”&lt;ref&gt;D.H.Th. Vollenhoven, “Plato’s realisme,” ''Philosophia Reformata'' 28, 97-133; also a fragment in A. Tol and K.A. Bril, ''Vollenhoven als Wijsgeer. Inleidingen en Teksten'' (Amsterdam: Buijten en Schipperheijn, 1992), 155-159; citation from p. 156 (valedictory address 1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since “knowing is a part of being,” the theory of knowledge presupposes ontology, hence analysis needs to proceed from created reality and respect its being law-bound. Theology, in turn, is dependent on [[revelation]], rather than on logically drawn conclusions about the being of God. The latter procedure ignores the boundary that defines our human limitation.

==On the history of philosophy==
As to the history of philosophy, Vollenhoven concentrated on developing a problem-historical method. A philosopher finds himself in a network of relations with his contemporaries and predecessors. This is reflected in his philosophical position, on the one hand in how he deals with current problems of his time and attempts to supersede them, on the other hand in evidencing preference for how a specific tradition of thought treats the problems that recur in all thought. The discussion of current problems is usually conducted in terms of a uniformity of style, focusing on those features that are taken to be normative or involving a view of truth or of law that is deemed fitting for such contemporary discussions. Seen from a greater range of time, the distinct styles of what were contemporary approaches give rise to historically distinct periods, in temporal succession, that Vollenhoven refers to as “time-currents” in philosophy (e.g., [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenism]], [[Neoplatonism]], [[Medieval philosophy|Waning Middle Ages]], the [[Age of Enlightenment]], [[Positivism]], [[Existentialism]], [[Postmodern philosophy|Postmodernism]]). 
On the other hand, the treatment of recurring problems centers on ontology and its influence on the variety of views concerning the world (or the cosmos, which may include the world of the gods, such as in [[Gnosticism]]) and concerning anthropology, often seen as reflecting the structure of the world. Vollenhoven finds that the ontologies that predominate in cosmology and anthropology are either [[Monism|monistic]] or [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]], each kind giving rise to a variety of traditional “types of ontology” (e.g., Priority theory, [[Interactionism (philosophy of mind)|Interactionism]], [[Parallelism (philosophy)|Parallelism]], Platonizing or Aristotelian [[hylomorphism]]). 
In summary any philosopher’s position can be situated in the crossing of a time-current and a type of ontology, which at the same time brings together and characterizes the philosophical conception of problems relevant for that position. The overall aim of the problem-historical method is to make visible the lay-out of currents and types, and thereby the basic problems of thought throughout the whole history of philosophy, from [[Hesiod]] to [[Martin Heidegger]].&lt;ref&gt;D.H.Th. Vollenhoven, ''Schematische Kaarten. Filosofische concepties in probleemhistorisch verband'', bewerkt door K.A. Bril en P.J. Boonstra (Amstelveen, De Zaak Haes, 2000). Also D.H.Th. Vollenhoven, ''Wijsgerig Woordenboek'', ed. by K.A. Bril (Amstelveen: De Zaak Haes, 2005), pp. 9, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vollenhoven hoped to publish a multi-volume history of philosophy, in cooperation with two of his former students, [[S. U. Zuidema]] and [[K. J. Popma]]. Many course notes had become syllabi between 1926 and 1948. In 1950 the first volume of the ''History of Philosophy'' appeared, covering the period of ancient philosophy prior to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;D.H.Th. Vollenhoven, ''Geschiedenis der Wijsbegeerte'' I (Franeker: T. Wever, 1950), 618 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt; At first the work was well received. But despite its 600 pages, the book remained a grand torso. Several philosophers convened (H.J. Pos, [[Willem Jacob Verdenius]], D. Loenen, Ms. C.J. de Vogel) to respond and together they aggressively criticized the book, particularly seizing on its ontological take-off point and problem-historical method. They also successfully advised against the federal funding of the second volume of this project.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. J. Stellingwerff’s Vollenhoven biography, note 1 above, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Vollenhoven was forced to seek other means. He was able to publish his problem-historical results in the philosophy articles he wrote for the [[Oosthoek (encyclopedia)|Oosthoek]] encyclopedia, in its 4th and 5th editions.&lt;ref&gt;In the meantime the articles of the 5th edition have been separately reprinted; cf. D.H.Th. Vollenhoven, ''Wijsgerig Woordenboek'', ed. by K.A. Bril (Amstelveen: De Zaak Haes, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==An association and opponents==
In 1935 Vollenhoven founded the “Association for Calvinistic Philosophy,” with ''[[Philosophia Reformata]]'' as its academic journal, ''Mededelingen'' to report its internal affairs, and ''Correspondentiebladen'' for exploratory discussions. Vollenhoven, who was the chairperson, opened the first meeting with the words: “[What] brings us together here is something glorious. It is not philosophy, for that is not what comes first in our lives. Rather it is the bond to [[Logos|God’s Word]], for by grace we have learned to desire to live solely through [[Christ]], [hence] religion, as concern of the heart, has become the center of our whole existence.” Of philosophy, as then current, Vollenhoven said: “[It] knows nothing of a God as understood in the [[Religious text|Scriptures]]; nothing of a heart that can only find rest in Him; nothing of world history, which lies anchored in the [[Adam|first]] and [[Last Adam|second Adam]]; also very little of the difference between life terrains, the distinction of which appears so necessary in daily life.”&lt;ref&gt;The opening speech (14 December 1935), originally printed in ''Mededeelingen'' 1, no. 1, (January 1936), is reprinted in the interview “Dr. D.H.Th. Vollenhoven,” in ''Perspectief'', ed. by W.K. van Dijk and others (Kampen: Kok, 1961), pp. 94-97; citations are from p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November 1938 the curators of the ''Vrije Universiteit'' received a formal complaint from the theological faculty (H. H. Kuyper, V. Hepp, J. Waterink, [[G. Ch. Aalders]], also [[F. W. Grosheide]], and even D. Nauta, but not C. van Gelderen), charging Vollenhoven with departing from the [[Reformed confessions of faith|Reformed confession]], on two counts: (i) the denial of “the duality of human existence, namely as a material, mortal body and as a immaterial, immortal soul;” (ii) the denial that the [[Son of God]] had “an impersonal human nature”—the view of the Son of God having a “personal” human nature, as held by Vollenhoven, was considered to be “an error reminding one of [[Nestorius]].” The first point is confused. Vollenhoven never denied the distinction of body and soul; what he denied was the view that is popular in the Protestant scholastic tradition concerning this distinction. A separate committee was formed to look into the matter. But [[World War II]] intervened, and the matter was dropped. The second point is based on a passage in Vollenhoven’s ''Calvinism and the Reformation of Philosophy'', which is vague and thus capable of being read as “[[Nestorianism|Nestorian]].” Prior to the charge, Vollenhoven had already openly regretted his formulation and promised to revise it, should a second edition of the book appear. He himself had no Nestorian leanings. Vollenhoven also argued that the expression “impersonal human nature” does not occur in the main confessions of the church in connection with [[Christology]]. So to consider the denial of this to be [[heresy]] is actually out of order. But the theological faculty, seeing its [[scholasticism]] threatened, sought to undercut Vollenhoven’s popularity and growing influence and used the concern for the confession to that end. He was forced to publicly recant his “error” and give a full explanation in a published article. To date, the university has not exonerated (the memory of) Vollenhoven of blame and its treatment of him.&lt;ref&gt;For a fuller description and discussion of this episode in Vollenhoven’s life, cf. chapter 9, “Vollenhoven beschuldigd” [Vollenhoven accused] of J. Stellingwerff’s Vollenhoven biography, note 1 above. For the relevant documents and their translations, consult the internet link: J. Glenn Friesen, [http://www.members.shaw.ca/hermandooyeweerd/Curators.html www.members.shaw.ca/hermandooyeweerd/Curators.html] . The article that Vollenhoven published in this connection is “Anhypostatos?” ''Philosophia Reformata'' 5 (1940), pp. 65-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further organizational work==
Following [[World War II]], Vollenhoven put into operation the initiative to designate specific chairs for the promotion of Reformational philosophy at public universities in the Netherlands by providing for capital and an organizational base, and also by appointing suitable persons to carry this out. Vollenhoven was now well-known. During the war he had become the chairman of the ''Algemeene Nederlandsche Vereeniging voor Wijsbegeerte'' [General Dutch Association for Philosophy]. He remained in office until the 10th [[World Congress of Philosophy]] had taken place in Amsterdam in August 1948. In 1947 the Foundation for Special Chairs in Calvinistic Philosophy came into existence, with Vollenhoven as chairman. Among the persons appointed to chairs, some were former students of Vollenhoven. At the Vrije Universiteit itself, [[S. U. Zuidema]] was appointed, in part to relieve Vollenhoven of the introduction to philosophy course, which, with the growth of the student population after the War, had become quite demanding. He could now apply himself almost entirely to the history of philosophy. He chose to remain the chairperson of the Association for Calvinistic Philosophy till 1963, the year that he retired.

==International influence==
Vollenhoven had followers in North America and South Africa. In North America, H.E. Runner, who had done post-graduate work under Vollenhoven, took the initiative of setting up “The Association for Reformed Scientific Studies,” which in 1967 opened the doors of the [[Institute for Christian Studies]] in [[Toronto]]. In South Africa, [[Hendrik G. Stoker]] and J.A.L. Taljaard together cooperated with Vollenhoven and Dooyeweerd in encouraging students to do post-graduate work at the Vrije Universiteit. In 1961 Vollenhoven gave numerous lectures in North America and two years later he lectured extensively in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;These lectures are now published: D.H.Th. Vollenhoven, ''Gastcolleges Wijsbegeerte. Erfenis voor het heden'', ed. by K.A. Bril and R.A. Nijhoff (Amstelveen: De Zaak Haes, 2011), 292 pgs. An English translation is currently (2013) in progress.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon retiring in 1963, Vollenhoven was succeeded by four persons: [[Hendrik van Riessen]], J. van der Hoeven, A.W. Begemann, and C.A. van Peursen. Van Riessen also succeeded Vollenhoven as chairperson of the “Association for Calvinistic Philosophy” (later “Calvinistic” gave way to “Reformational,” still later to “Christian”). After giving his valedictory address on “Plato’s realism,” Vollenhoven continued to give private monthly lectures to specialists in his problem-historical work.&lt;ref&gt;This last phase of Vollenhoven’s career is discussed in K.A. Bril, ''Vollenhoven’s laatste werk, 1970-1975'' (Amsterdam: VU Boekhandel, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Vollenhoven died at the age of 85, having been a widower for the last five-and-a-half years of his life.

==Early life and education==
Ford was raised as an Anglican in the [[Church of Ireland]] in Dublin. His father died when he was 12 years old&lt;ref name="practical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huff"/&gt; and he was raised by his mother, Phyllis Mary Elizabeth Ford.&lt;ref name="wisdom"/&gt;

For his undergraduate education, he studied at [[Trinity College Dublin]],&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; where he was active in politics, debate and journalism. He was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a scholar]] in classics in 1968. After completing his degree,&lt;ref name="jp"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jp2center.org/yk-files/49e4b679281c5e9b60322e8b3d5770c0/Ford_CV.pdf |title=David Ford |accessdate=21 May 2011 |publisher=The John Paul II Center for Interreligious Dialogue}}&lt;/ref&gt; he interviewed for jobs at [[British Steel Corporation]] and [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], but then was offered a scholarship to [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] at the University of Cambridge and decided to study theology for a few years before going into business.&lt;ref name="practical"/&gt; He earned his bachelor's degree in theology&lt;ref name="jp"/&gt; at Cambridge and went on to earn his [[Master of Sacred Theology]] degree at [[Yale Divinity School]]; he also did graduate work at the [[University of Tübingen]]. He gained his doctorate at Cambridge,&lt;ref name="div"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-ford/a-journey-into-interfaith_b_843057.html |last=Ford |first=David |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=2 April 2011 |title=A Journey into Interfaith Engagement |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing his dissertation on [[Karl Barth]] and biblical narrative&lt;ref name="practical"/&gt; under the direction of [[Donald M. MacKinnon|Donald MacKinnon]]&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1976 |title=Theological Wisdom, British Style |last=Ford |first=David |journal=The Christian Century |date=5 April 2000 |pages=388–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Sykes]]. The result was the book ''Barth and God's Story'' (1981). Ford later received an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Divinity]] degree from the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="div"/&gt;

==Career==
From 1976–1991 Ford was a lecturer (later senior lecturer) at the University of Birmingham.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; Living in the [[inner city]], his theology was shaped by a multi-faith experience, and he also became involved in a local Anglican church in the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] tradition. As his housemate was involved in renovating derelict houses, he lived in some of those houses and became a house manager for one of them.&lt;ref name="practical"/&gt; In the university's theology department, he became close to theologian [[Daniel W. Hardy]] and went on to marry Hardy's daughter.&lt;ref name="huff"/&gt;

In 1991 he moved to Cambridge to become the Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; He is the first professor in this post who is not in the [[Anglican ministry]].&lt;ref name="Virginia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dovmedia.org/5.html |title=The Annual Bishop's Clergy / Lay Employee / Spouse Conference: May 4–6, 2009 |accessdate=21 May 2011 |publisher=Diocese of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped found and chairs the management committee of the Centre for Advanced Religious and Theological Studies at Cambridge. He is a member of St John's College, a fellow of [[Selwyn College, Cambridge|Selwyn College]], and a foundation member of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

He is highly regarded for his scholarship, wit and humour. He is a sought-after lecturer and preacher and serves as an advisor to the bishops of the [[Anglican Communion]].&lt;ref name="practical"/&gt; His books have met with wide appeal; his ''The Modern Theologians: An Introduction to Christian Theology in the Twentieth Century'' ([[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]], 1997), now in its third printing, is the leading textbook on modern Christian theology in the English-speaking world, China and [[Korea]].&lt;ref name="jp"/&gt; His ''Theology: A Very Short Introduction'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 1999), part of the [[Very Short Introductions]] series, has been translated into many languages, including Chinese, [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]].&lt;ref name="jp"/&gt;

===Multi-faith and inter-faith work===
When Ford came to Cambridge in 1991, the theology department focused almost exclusively on Christianity. Ford assisted in the realisation of a development plan which included a new building, a new Centre for Advanced Religious and Theological Studies, new endowed research posts, and the development of the Cambridge Theological Federation (the university's consortium of Anglican, [[Methodism|Methodist]], and [[United Reformed Church|United Reformed]] seminaries). The university went on to add two new posts in [[Islamic studies]], a new post in [[New Testament]], and a new endowed post in theology and [[natural science]]. A [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] institute and institute for [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] theology were added to the consortium of seminaries.&lt;ref name="practical"/&gt; The [[Centre for Jewish-Christian Relations]] was established in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woolf.cam.ac.uk/cjcr/about-us/history.php |title=History |publisher=Woolf Institute |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the Centre for the Study of Muslim-Jewish Relations in 2006.

Ford was introduced to [[interfaith dialogue]] in the early 1990s&lt;ref name="models"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.interfaith.cam.ac.uk/en/resources/papers/new-models-for-religion-in-public?searched=david+ford&amp;advsearch=oneword&amp;highlight=ajaxSearch_highlight+ajaxSearch_highlight1+ajaxSearch_highlight2  |title= New Models for Religion in Public: Inter-Faith Friendship and the Politics of Scriptural Reasoning

Ochs|Peter Ochs]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31500">'''Engineering ethics''' is the field of [[applied ethics]] and system of moral principles that apply to the practice of [[engineering]]. The field examines and sets the obligations by [[engineer]]s to [[society]], to their clients, and to the profession.  As a scholarly discipline, it is closely related to subjects such as the [[philosophy of science]], the [[philosophy of engineering]], and the [[ethics of technology]].

==Background and origins==

===The 18th century and growing concern===
[[File:Original Tay Bridge before the 1879 collapse.jpg|thumb|The first [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay Bridge collapsed]] in 1879. At least sixty were killed.]]
As engineering rose as a distinct profession during the 19th century, engineers saw themselves as either independent professional practitioners or technical employees of large enterprises. There was considerable tension between the two sides as large industrial employers fought to maintain control of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;Layton (1986). pp. 6-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States growing professionalism gave rise to the development of four founding engineering societies: The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) (1851), the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (AIEE) (1884),&lt;ref name = "AIEE to IEEE"&gt;The AIEE merged with the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] (IRE) (1912) in 1963 to form the IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) (1880), and the [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers|American Institute of Mining Engineers]] (AIME) (1871).&lt;ref name = "AIME"&gt;AIME is now the umbrella organization of four technical societies: the [http://www.smenet.org/ Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration] (SME) (1957), [[The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society (TMS)|The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society]] (TMS) (1957), the [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]] (SPE) (1957), and the [http://www.aist.org Association For Iron and Steel Technology] (AIST) (1974). Neither AIME, nor its subsidiary societies have adopted a formal code of ethics.&lt;/ref&gt; ASCE and AIEE were more closely identified with the engineer as learned professional, where ASME, to an extent, and AIME almost entirely, identified with the view that the engineer is a technical employee.&lt;ref name = "Layton p. 35"&gt;Layton (1986) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even so, at that time ethics was viewed as a personal rather than a broad professional concern.&lt;ref name = "ASCE Standard, p. 10"&gt;ASCE (2000). p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASCE code of ethics"&gt;{{cite web

===Turning of the  20th century and turning point===
[[File:BostonMolassesDisaster.jpg|thumb|The [[Boston molasses disaster]] provided a strong impetus for the establishment of professional licensing and codes of ethics in the United States.]]When the 19th century drew to a close and the 20th century began, there had been series of significant [[structural failure]]s, including some spectacular [[List of bridge disasters|bridge failures]], notably the [[Ashtabula River Railroad Disaster]] (1876), [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay Bridge Disaster]] (1879), and the [[Quebec Bridge#Collapse of August 29.2C 1907|Quebec Bridge collapse]] (1907). These had a profound effect on engineers and forced the profession to confront shortcomings in technical and construction practice, as well as ethical standards.&lt;ref&gt;ASME member H.F.J. Porter had proposed as early as 1892 that the engineering societies adopt uniform membership, education, and licensing requirements as well as a code of ethics. (Layton (1986). pp. 45-46)&lt;/ref&gt;

One response was the development of formal codes of ethics by three of the four founding engineering societies. AIEE adopted theirs in 1912. ASCE and ASME did so in 1914.&lt;ref name = "Layton pp. 70 &amp; 114"&gt;Layton (1986). pp. 70 &amp; 114.&lt;/ref&gt; AIME did not adopt a code of ethics in its history.&lt;ref name = "Layton p. 35"/&gt;

Concerns for professional practice and protecting the public highlighted by these bridge failures, as well as the [[Boston molasses disaster]] (1919), provided impetus for another movement that had been underway for some time: to require formal credentials (Professional Engineering licensure in the US) as a requirement to [[Professional Engineer|practice]]. This involves meeting some combination of educational, experience, and testing requirements.&lt;ref name = "Layton pp. 124-125"&gt;Layton (1986). pp. 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|Association of German Engineers]] developed an oath for all its members titled 'The Confession of the Engineers', directly hinting at the role of engineers in the atrocities committed during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Technische Intelligenz und "Kulturfaktor Technik" |editor-last=Dietz |editor-first=Burkhard |date=1996 |pages=29 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=FGfkMqguYd4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Technik und Verantwortung im Nationalsozialismus |date=2004 |last=Lorenz |first=Werner |last2=Meyer |first2=Torsen |pages=55 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=9ClQ9yxA7-QC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vdi.de/fileadmin/media/content/hg/16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following decades most American states and Canadian provinces either required engineers to be licensed, or passed special legislation reserving title rights to organization of professional engineers.&lt;ref name = "Layton"&gt;Layton (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian model is to require all persons working in fields of engineering that posed a risk to life, health, property, the public welfare and the environment to be licensed, and all provinces required licensing by the 1950s.

The US model has generally been only to require the practicing engineers offering engineering services that impact the public welfare, safety, safeguarding of life, health, or property to be licensed, while engineers working in private industry without a direct offering of engineering services to the public or other businesses, education, and government need not be licensed &lt;ref&gt;https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/lawrules.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. This has perpetuated the split between professional engineers and those in private industry.&lt;ref name = "Layton pp. 6-7"&gt;Layton (1986). pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; Professional societies have adopted generally uniform codes of ethics.

===Recent developments===
[[File:Citigroup center from ground.jpg|thumb|[[Citigroup Center#Engineering crisis of 1978|William LeMessurier's response]] to design deficiencies uncovered after construction of the Citigroup Center is often cited as an example of ethical conduct.]]

Efforts to promote ethical practice continue. In addition to the professional societies and chartering organizations efforts with their members, the Canadian [[Iron Ring]] and American [[Order of the Engineer]] trace their roots to the 1907 Quebec Bridge collapse. Both require members to swear an oath to uphold ethical practice and wear a symbolic ring as a reminder.

In the United States, the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] released in 1946 its Canons of Ethics for Engineers and Rules of Professional Conduct, which evolved to the current Code of Ethics, adopted in 1964. These requests ultimately led to the creation of the Board of Ethical Review in 1954. Ethics cases rarely have easy answers, but the BER's nearly 500 advisory opinions have helped bring clarity to the ethical issues engineers face daily.&lt;ref name=BER&gt;{{cite web

Currently, bribery and political corruption is being addressed very directly by several professional societies and business groups around the world.&lt;ref name = "TI bribery"&gt;{{cite book | author = Transparency International and Social Accountability International |year = 2009 | title = Business Principles for Countering Bribery | url =http://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/pub/business_principles_for_countering_bribery| accessdate = 2013-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASCE bribery"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Report Details Guidelines to Reduce Corruption in Engineering and Construction Industry |publisher=ASCE |date=2005-06-17 |url=http://www.asce.org/pressroom/news/display_press.cfm?uid=1794 |accessdate=2006-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165346/http://www.asce.org/pressroom/news/display_press.cfm?uid=1794 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new issues have arisen, such as [[offshoring]], [[sustainable development]], and environmental protection, that the profession is having to consider and address.

==General principles==
{{Rquote|right|Engineers, in the fulfillment of their professional duties, shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public|National Society of Professional Engineers|&lt;ref name="NSPE Paramount"/&gt;}}

{{Rquote|right|A practitioner shall, regard the practitioner's duty to public welfare as paramount."|Professional Engineers Ontario|&lt;ref name="PEO public good"/&gt;}}

Codes of engineering ethics identify a specific precedence with respect to the engineer's consideration for the [[society|public]], clients, employers, and the profession.

Many engineering professional societies have prepared codes of ethics. Some date to the early decades of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name = "Layton"/&gt; These have been incorporated to a greater or lesser degree into the regulatory laws of several jurisdictions.  While these statements of general principles served as a guide, engineers still require sound judgment to interpret how the code would apply to specific circumstances.

The general principles of the codes of ethics are largely similar across the various engineering societies and chartering authorities of the world,&lt;ref name="ICE canon"&gt;ICE (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; which further extend the code and publish specific guidance.&lt;ref name="ASCE Standards"&gt;ASCE (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The following is an example from the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]:&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"&gt;ASCE [1914] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

#Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public and shall strive to comply with the principles of sustainable development in the performance of their professional duties.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall perform services only in areas of their competence.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall act in professional matters for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees, and shall avoid conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall build their professional reputation on the merit of their services and shall not compete unfairly with others.
#Engineers shall act in such a manner as to uphold and enhance the honor, integrity, and dignity of the engineering profession and shall act with zero-tolerance for bribery, fraud, and corruption.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall continue their professional development throughout their careers, and shall provide opportunities for the professional development of those engineers under their supervision.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;

===Obligation to society===
The paramount value recognized by engineers is the safety and welfare of the public. As demonstrated by the following selected excerpts, this is the case for professional engineering organizations in nearly every jurisdiction and engineering discipline:

*'''[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]''': "We, the members of the IEEE, … do hereby commit ourselves to the highest ethical and professional conduct and agree: 1. to accept responsibility in making decisions consistent with the safety, health and welfare of the public, and to disclose promptly factors that might endanger the public or the environment;"&lt;ref name="IEEE Paramount"&gt;IEEE (2006).

'''Responsibility of engineers'''

The engineers recognize that the greatest merit is the work and exercise their profession committed to serving society, attending to the welfare and progress of the majority.
By transforming nature for the benefit of mankind, engineers must increase their awareness of the world as the abode of humanity, their interest in the universe as a guarantee of overcoming their spirit, and knowledge of reality to make the world fairer and happier.
The engineer should reject any paper that is intended to harm the general interest, thus avoiding a situation that might be hazardous or threatening to the environment, life, health, or other rights of human beings.
It is an inescapable duty of the engineer to uphold the prestige of the profession, to ensure its proper discharge, and to maintain a professional demeanor rooted in ability, honesty, fortitude, temperance, magnanimity, modesty, honesty, and justice; with the consciousness of individual well-being subordinate to the social good.
The engineers and their employers must ensure the continuous improvement of their knowledge, particularly of their profession, disseminate their knowledge, share their experience, provide opportunities for education and training of workers, provide recognition, moral and material support to the schools where they studied, thus returning the benefits and opportunities they and their employers have received.
It is the responsibility of the engineers to carry out their work efficiently and to support the law. In particular, they must ensure compliance with the standards of worker protection as provided by the law.
As professionals, the engineers are expected to commit themselves to high standards of conduct (NSPE). [1] 11/27/11

===Whistleblowing===
[[File:Challenger explosion.jpg|thumb|right|220px| The [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] is used as a case study of whistleblowing and [[organizational behavior]] including [[groupthink]].]]
{{main article|Whistleblower}}
A basic ethical dilemma is that an engineer has the duty to report to the appropriate authority a possible risk to others from a client or employer failing to follow the engineer's directions. According to first principles, this duty overrides the duty to a client and/or employer.&lt;ref&gt;Weil, [http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/EthicsResources/Otherresources/whistle.html "Whistleblowing:  What Have We Learned Since the Challenger?"]&lt;/ref&gt; An engineer may be disciplined, or have their license revoked, even if the failure to report such a danger does not result in the loss of life or health.&lt;ref&gt;See NSPE, Board of Ethical Review, Cases [http://www.niee.org/cases/78-88/case82-5.htm 82-5] and [http://www.niee.org/cases/78-88/case88-6.htm 88-6].&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, this duty can be discharged by advising the client of the consequences in a forthright matter, and ensuring the client takes the engineer's advice. In very rare cases, where even a governmental authority may not take appropriate action, the engineer can only discharge the duty by making the situation public.&lt;ref name="NSPE Whistleblowing"&gt;{{cite journal|author=NSPE |title=Final Report of the NSPE Task Force on Overruling Engineering Judgment to the NSPE Board of Directors |date=2006-06-30 |url=http://164.109.88.17/ethics/FINALReporttoNSPEBoard-June2006.pdf |accessdate=2008-02-20 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[whistleblowing]] by professional engineers is not an unusual event, and courts have often sided with engineers in such cases, overruling duties to employers and confidentiality considerations that otherwise would have prevented the engineer from speaking out.&lt;ref&gt;See the case of [[Shawn Carpenter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conduct===
There are several other ethical issues that engineers may face. Some have to do with technical practice, but many others have to do with broader considerations of business conduct. These include:&lt;ref name = "ASCE Standards" /&gt;
*Relationships with clients, consultants, competitors, and contractors
*Ensuring legal compliance by clients, client's contractors, and others
*[[Conflict of interest]]
*[[Bribery]] and [[kickbacks]], which also may include:
**Gifts, meals, services, and entertainment
*Treatment of [[trade secret|confidential]] or [[United States Economic and Protection of Proprietary Information Act|proprietary information]]
*Consideration of the employer’s assets
*Outside employment/activities ([[wikt:moonlight#Verb|Moonlighting]])

Some engineering societies are addressing [[environmental protection]] as a stand-alone question of ethics.&lt;ref name = "ASCE canons" /&gt;

The field of [[business ethics]] often overlaps and informs ethical decision making for engineers.

==Case studies and key individuals==
Petroski notes that most engineering failures are much more involved than simple technical mis-calculations and involve the failure of the design process or management culture.&lt;ref name = "Petroski"&gt;Petroski (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all engineering failures involve ethical issues. The infamous collapse of the first [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]], and the losses of the [[Mars Polar Lander]] and [[Mars Climate Orbiter]] were technical and design process failures.

These episodes of engineering failure include ethical as well as technical issues.

{{Other uses|Enneagram (disambiguation){{!}}Enneagram}}
The '''Enneagram of Personality''', or simply the '''Enneagram''' (from the Greek words {{wikt-lang|grc|ἐννέα}} [{{grc-tr|ἐννέα}}, meaning "nine"] and {{wikt-lang|grc|γράμμα}} [{{grc-tr|γράμμα}}, meaning something "written" or "drawn"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblesuite.com/greek/1121.htm|title=Strong's Greek: 1121. γράμμα (gramma) -- that which is drawn or written, i.e. a letter|work=biblesuite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]), is a model of the [[Psyche (psychology)|human psyche]] which is principally understood and taught as a typology of nine interconnected [[personality type]]s. Although the origins and history of many of the ideas and theories associated with the Enneagram of Personality are a matter of dispute, contemporary Enneagram claims are principally derived from the teachings of [[Oscar Ichazo]] and [[Claudio Naranjo]]. Naranjo's theories were partly influenced by some earlier teachings of [[George Gurdjieff]]. As a typology the Enneagram defines nine personality types (sometimes called "enneatypes"), which are represented by the points of a geometric figure called an [[Enneagram (geometry)|enneagram]],&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Albert |authorlink1=Albert Ellis (psychologist)|last2=Abrams|first2=Mike |last3=Dengelegi Abrams|first3=Lidia |title=Personality theories: critical perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4_FOIKi2_tYC&amp;pg=PA569&amp;lpg=PA569&amp;dq=%22New+age+theories+of+personality:+The+Enneagram%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22New%20age%20theories%20of%20personality%3A%20The%20Enneagram%22&amp;f=false|year=2008|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-7062-4|quote=Ichazo has disowned Naranjo, Palmer and the other Jesuit writers on the Enneagram on the grounds that his descriptions of the nine types represent ego fixations that develop in early childhood in response to trauma.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which indicate connections between the types. There are different schools of thought among Enneagram teachers, therefore their ideas are not always in agreement.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;

The Enneagram of Personality has been widely promoted in both [[business management]] and spirituality contexts through seminars, conferences, books, magazines, and DVDs.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Peter |title=Encyclopedia of new religious movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLipBC05pF8C&amp;pg|year=2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-203-48433-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Daren |title=New age: a guide : alternative spiritualities from Aquarian conspiracy to Next Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xz4EWg1WWmMC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=%22New+age%22+%22Enneagram%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Enneagram%22&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-1532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In business contexts it is generally used as a typology to gain insights into workplace interpersonal-dynamics; in [[spirituality]] it is more commonly presented as a path to higher states of being, essence, and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]. Both contexts say it can aid in self-awareness, self-understanding and [[self-development]].&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt; 

There has been limited formal [[psychometric]] analysis of the Enneagram and the [[Peer review|peer-reviewed research]] that has been done has not been widely accepted within the [[Epistemic community|relevant academic communities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=EQFPCQAAQBAJ|title=Science and Pseudoscience in Social Work Practice|last=Thyer|first=Dr Bruce A.|last2=Pignotti|first2=Monica|date=2015-05-15|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|year=|isbn=9780826177681|location=|pages=49|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The origins and historical development of the Enneagram of Personality are matters of dispute. Wiltse and Palmer&lt;ref name=Wiltse&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiltse|first=V.|author2=Palmer, H.|title=Hidden in plain sight: Observations on the origin of the Enneagram|journal=The Enneagram Journal|date=July 2011|volume=4|issue=1|pages=4–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that similar ideas to the Enneagram of Personality are found in the work of [[Evagrius Ponticus]], a Christian mystic who lived in 4th century Alexandria. Evagrius identified eight ''logismoi'' ("deadly thoughts") plus an overarching thought he called "love of self". Evagrius wrote, "The first thought of all is that of love of self (''philautia''); after this, [come] the eight."&lt;ref name="Harmless p 511"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harmless|first=W.|author2=Fitzgerald, R.R.|title=The saphhire light of the mind: The Skemmata of Evagrius Ponticus|journal=Theological Studies|year=2001|volume=62|pages=498–529}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to identifying eight deadly thoughts, Evagrius also identified eight "remedies" to these thoughts.&lt;ref name=Wiltse /&gt;

[[G. I. Gurdjieff]] is credited with making the enneagram figure commonly known&lt;ref name="internationalenneagram"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalenneagram.org/enneagram_history/index.html |title=International Enneagram Association - History |work=internationalenneagram.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125114645/http://www.internationalenneagram.org/enneagram_history/index.html |archivedate=25 November 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Fourth Way enneagram]]). He did not, however, develop the nine personality types associated with the Enneagram. [[Oscar Ichazo]] is generally recognized as the principal source&lt;ref name="internationalenneagram" /&gt; of the contemporary Enneagram of Personality which is largely derived from some of Ichazo's teachings, such as those on ego-fixations, holy ideas, passions and virtues. The Bolivian-born Ichazo began teaching programs of self-development in the 1950s. His teaching, which he calls "[[Protoanalysis]]", uses the enneagram figure among many other symbols and ideas. Ichazo founded the [[Arica Institute]] which was originally based in Chile before moving to the United States&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; and coined the term "Enneagram of Personality".&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt;

[[Claudio Naranjo]] is a Chilean-born psychiatrist who first learned about the Enneagram of Personality from Ichazo at a course in Arica, Chile. He then began developing and teaching his own understanding of the Enneagram in the United States in the early 1970s, influencing others including some Jesuit priests who adapted the Enneagram for use in Christian spirituality. Ichazo disowned Naranjo and the other teachers on what he felt were misinterpretations and uses of the Enneagram. Among Naranjo's early students there are also differing understandings of Enneagram theory.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; Numerous other authors, including Helen Palmer, [[Don Richard Riso]], [[Richard Rohr]] and [[Elizabeth Wagele]], also began publishing widely read books on the Enneagram of Personality in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Enneagram figure==
[[File:Enneagram.svg|thumb|alt=Enneagram symbol|&lt;center&gt;Enneagram figure&lt;/center&gt;]]

The [[enneagram (geometry)|enneagram figure]] is usually composed of three parts; a circle, an inner triangle (connecting 3-6-9) and an irregular hexagonal "periodic figure" (connecting [[142857 (number)|1-4-2-8-5-7]]). According to esoteric spiritual traditions,&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''The Enneagram'', p.36&lt;/ref&gt; the circle symbolizes unity, the inner triangle symbolizes the "law of three" and the hexagon represents the "law of seven" (because 1-4-2-8-5-7-1 is the repeating decimal created by dividing one by seven in base 10 arithmetic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rahul.net/raithel/otfw/93article.html|title=The Theory of Process and The Law of Seven|work=rahul.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three elements constitute the usual enneagram figure.&lt;ref&gt;Wagele, ''Enneagram Made Easy'', pp. 1–11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nine types==
The table below offers some of the principal characteristics of the nine types along with their basic relationships. This table expands upon Oscar Ichazo's ego fixations, holy ideas, passions, and virtues&lt;ref name="IchazoInterviews"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ichazo|first=Oscar|title=Interviews with Oscar Ichazo|publisher=Arica Institute Press|isbn=978-0-916-55403-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily using material from ''Understanding the Enneagram: The Practical Guide to Personality Types'' (revised edition) by [[Riso–Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator|Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson]].&lt;ref name="Riso"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riso|first1=Don Richard |last2=Hudson|first2=Russ |title=Understanding the Enneagram: The Practical Guide to Personality Types|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vuIW_TIw8BIC&amp;dq=Understanding+the+Enneagram:+The+Practical+Guide+to+Personality+Types,+revised+addition|year=2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-618-00415-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists may disagree on some aspects. The types are normally referred to by their numbers, but sometimes their "characteristic roles" (which refers to distinctive [[archetypal]] characteristics) are used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baron|first=Renee|title=What Type Am I: Discover Who You Really Are|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various labels for each type are commonly used by different authors and teachers. The "stress" and "security" points (sometimes referred to as the "disintegration" and "integration" points) are the types, connected by the lines of the enneagram figure, that are believed by some to influence a person in more adverse or relaxed circumstances. According to this theory, someone classed as a One type, for example, may begin to think, feel and act more like a Four type when stressed, or more like a Seven type when relaxed.

===Wings===
Most, but not all, Enneagram of Personality theorists teach a person's basic type is modified, at least to some extent, by the personality dynamics of the two adjacent types as indicated on the enneagram figure. These two types are often called "wings". A person of the Three personality type, for example, is understood to have points Two and Four as their wing types. The circle of the enneagram figure may indicate that the types or points exist on a spectrum rather than as distinct types or points unrelated to those adjacent to them. A person may be understood, therefore, to have a core type and one or two wing types which influence but do not change the core type.&lt;ref name="Riso, p.19"&gt;Riso, ''Wisdom of the Enneagram'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, ''Wagner Enneagram Personality Style Scales'', p. 2.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connecting lines===
For some Enneagram theorists the lines connecting the points add further meaning to the information provided by the descriptions of the types. Sometimes called the "security" and "stress" points, or points of "integration" and "disintegration", some theorists believe these connected points also contribute to a person's overall personality. From this viewpoint, therefore, at least four other points affect a person's overall personality; the two points connected by the lines to the core type and the two wing points.&lt;ref&gt;Riso, ''Wisdom of the Enneagram'', pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, ''Wagner Enneagram Personality Style Scales'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier teachings about the connecting lines are now rejected or modified by many Enneagram teachers, including Claudio Naranjo who developed them.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Instinctual subtypes===
Each of the personality types is usually understood as having three "instinctual subtypes". These subtypes are believed to be formed according to which one of three instinctual energies of a person is dominantly developed and expressed. The instinctual energies are usually called "self-preservation", "sexual" (also called "intimacy" or "one-to-one") and "social". On the instinctual level, people may internally stress and externally express the need to protect themselves (self-preservation), to connect with important others or partners (sexual), or to get along or succeed in groups (social).&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''The Enneagram in Love and Work'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, there are twenty-seven distinct personality patterns, because people of each of the nine types also express themselves as one of the three subtypes.&lt;ref&gt;Maitri, ''The Spiritual Dimension of the Enneagram'', pp. 263–264&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative approach to the subtypes looks at them as three domains or clusters of instincts that result in increased probability of survival (the "preserving" domain), increased skill in navigating the social environment (the "navigating" domain) and increased likelihood of reproductive success (the "transmitting" domain).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awarenesstoaction.com/downloads/the_instincts.pdf "The Instincts: Taking a Broader View"], by Mario Sikora, ''Enneagram Monthly'', June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; From this understanding the subtypes reflect individual differences in the presence of these three separate clusters of instincts.

It is believed people function in all three forms of instinctual energies but one may dominate. According to some theorists, another instinct may also be well-developed and the third often less developed.&lt;ref&gt;Riso, ''The Wisdom of the Enneagram'', pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{POV section|date=August 2018}}
While Enneagram teachings have attained some degree of popularity, they have also received criticism including accusations of being [[pseudoscience]],  subject to interpretation and difficult to test or validate scientifically.&lt;ref name="Kaluzniacky"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaluzniacky|first=Eugene |title=Managing psychological factors in information systems work: an orientation to emotional intelligence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SwE8RVv6C8AC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Enneagram+scientific#v=onepage&amp;q=Enneagram%20ad%20hoc&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=Idea Group Inc (IGI)|isbn=978-1-59140-198-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been criticized as "an assessment method of no demonstrated reliability or validity".&lt;ref name="ThyerPignotti2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1= Bruce A. Thyer|author2=Monica Pignotti|title=Science and Pseudoscience in Social Work Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQFPCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64|date=15 May 2015|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8261-7768-1|pages=64–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[scientific skeptic]] [[Robert Todd Carroll]] included the Enneagram in a list of pseudoscientific theories that "can't be tested because they are so vague and malleable that anything relevant can be shoehorned to fit the theory".&lt;ref name="Carroll2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Carroll|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;pg=PA306|date=11 January 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-04563-3|pages=306–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enneagram has also received criticism from some religious perspectives. In 2000, the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]' Committee on Doctrine produced a draft report on the origins of the Enneagram to aid bishops in their evaluation of its use in their dioceses. The report identified aspects of the intersection between the Enneagram and Roman Catholicism which, in their opinion, warranted scrutiny and seen as potential areas of concern, stating, "While the enneagram system shares little with traditional Christian doctrine or spirituality, it also shares little with the methods and criteria of modern science... The burden of proof is on proponents of the enneagram to furnish scientific evidence for their claims."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natcath.org/NCR_Online/documents/ennea2.htm "A Brief Report On The Origins Of The Enneagram"], Draft from the U.S. bishops' Secretariat for Doctrine and Pastoral Practices, 10 October 2000, corrected 23 October 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Partly in response to some [[Jesuit]]s and members of other religious orders teaching a Christian understanding of the Enneagram of Personality, a 2003 Vatican document called ''[[A Christian reflection on the New Age|Jesus Christ, the Bearer of the Water of Life. A Christian Reflection on the 'New Age']]'' said that the Enneagram "when used as a means of spiritual growth introduces an ambiguity in the doctrine and the life of the Christian faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions |series= Western Mystery Tradition Series |author= Richard Smoley, Jay Kinney |edition= revised, illustrated |publisher= [[Quest Books]] |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0-8356-0844-2 |page= 229 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1uTgYGT3quAC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=Enneagram+of+Personality+vatican#v=onepage&amp;q=Enneagram%20of%20Personality%20vatican&amp;f=false |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3696">The '''enrolled bill rule''' is a principle of judicial interpretation of rules of procedure in [[Legislature|legislative]] bodies. Under the doctrine, once a [[Bill (law)|bill]] passes a legislative body and is signed into law, the courts assume that all rules of procedure in the enactment process were properly followed. That is, "[i]f a legislative document is authenticated in regular form by the appropriate officials, the court treats that document as properly adopted."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Thomas'', 788 F.2d 1250 ([[7th Cir.]] 1986), ''[[certiorari|cert.]] denied'', 107 S.Ct. 187 (1986), citing ''Field v. Clark'', 143 U.S. 649, 36 L.Ed. 294, 12 S.Ct. 495 (1892).&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
The doctrine was adopted  in ''[[The King v. Arundel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1616] EWHC J11&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the proposition that when an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] was passed and assented to, it was affixed with the Great Seal, the "effective legal act of enactment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/jlsp/pdf/Winter%202007/sandler.pdf |pages=217–19 |journal=Columbia Journal of Law and Social Problems |title=Forget What You Learned in Civics Class: The "Enrolled Bill Rule" and Why It's Time to Overrule ''Field v. Clark'' |volume=41 |last1=Sandler |first1=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "a regal act, and no official might dispute the king's word."

The enrolled bill rule was restated by [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|Lord Campbell]] in ''Edinburgh &amp; Dalkeith Railway Co v Wauchope''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1842/J12.html &amp;#91;1842&amp;#93; UKHL J12; 1 Bell 278; 8 Cl &amp; Fin 710; 8 ER 279].&lt;/ref&gt; In that case it was complained that the passage of a [[private bill]] was defective because proper notice had not been given. The House of Lords rejected the notion that the validity of an Act could be questioned.

==United States==
In the United States, the rule was adopted by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in {{ussc|name=Field v. Clark|143|649|1892}}. In effect, the court ruled that the enrolled bill signed by the presiding officers of the two houses of Congress was the best evidence of what had been passed, being on balance better evidence than the journals of the respective houses, so it should not be called into question.&lt;ref name=sandler/&gt;

===State law===
At the time of the decision in ''Field'', nine states had adopted the doctrine, and thirteen had rejected it.&lt;ref name=sandler&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=143&amp;invol=649 143 U.S. 649].&lt;/ref&gt; At least two states have weakened it:

*The [[Supreme Court of Kentucky]]&lt;ref&gt;''D&amp;W Auto Supply v. Dept. of Revenue'', 602 S.W.2d 420 (Ky. 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; has held that "there is a [[prima facie]] presumption that an enrolled bill is valid but such presumption may be overcome by clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence establishing that constitutional requirements have not been met."
*The [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]] has limited the application of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''Consumer Party of Pa. v. Commonwealth'', 507 A.2d 323 (Pa. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; It held, "When a law has been passed and approved and certified in due form, it is no part of the duty of the judiciary to go behind the law as duly certified to inquire into the observance of form in its passage," but the court also noted that "it would be a serious dereliction... to deliberately ignore a clear constitutional violation."

[[Environmental racism]] is a term used by Vincze (2013) for "the practice of environmental injustice within a racialized context", in which "socially marginalized communities and minority groups" are subjected to disproportionate exposure of environmental hazards, denial of access to sources of ecological sustenance such as clean air, water, and natural resources, or infringement of environmentally related human rights.&lt;ref name=Steger/&gt;{{rp|10}}&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|252}} 
According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], [[environmental justice]] is "the fair treatment for people of all races, cultures, and incomes, regarding the development of environmental laws, regulations and policies".&lt;ref name="Steger"&gt;Steger, Tamara et al. eds. [http://www.env-health.org/IMG/pdf/ceu_teljes_pdf.pdf ''Making the Case for Environmental Justice in Central &amp; Eastern Europe'']. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006040855/http://www.env-health.org/IMG/pdf/ceu_teljes_pdf.pdf |date=October 6, 2016}} Budapest: CEU Center for Environmental Policy and Law, The Central European University; The Health and Environment Alliance; and The Coalition for Environmental Justice, March 2007. pp. 1–57.

As applied to [[Western Europe]],  patterns of "environmental racism" have been postulated in particular   toward [[Romani people|Romani]] communities.
According to Trehan and Kocze (2009), "[[European Union|EU]] accession for the post-socialist countries has resulted in a de facto centre and periphery within Europe itself, thus exacerbating the already marginal economic and political position of Roma in Europe whose communities continue to subsist as internal colonies within Europe."&lt;ref name=Harper&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Harper, Krista|author2=Steger, Tamara|author3=Filčák, Richard|title=Environmental Justice and Roma Communities in Central and Eastern Europe|journal=Environmental Policy and Governance Env.

===Underlying issues===

In [[Central and Eastern Europe]], socialist governments have generally prioritized industrial development over environmental protection, in spite of growing public and governmental environmental awareness in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|255}} Even though public concern over the environmental effects of industrial expansion such as mine and dam construction grew in the late 1980s and early 1990s, policy makers continued to focus on privatization and economic development.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|255}} Following the market transition, environmental issues have persisted, despite some improvements during the early stages of transition.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|255}} Throughout this time, significant social restructuring took place alongside environmental changes.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|255}}
[[File:Yambol Landfill.jpg|thumb|Romani workers at Yambol Landfill, Bulgaria.]]

According to K. Harper et al, "in the case of Roma in CEE [Central and Eastern Europe], spaces inhabited by low-income Roma have come to be 'racialized' during the post-socialist era, intensifying patterns of environmental exclusion along ethnic lines".&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|254}} Romani peoples have inhabited Central and Eastern Europe for six hundred years and have traditionally worked or been employed as agricultural day laborers, musicians, tinsmiths (tinkers), and blacksmiths.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|255}} In the words of K. Harper et al, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The interwar period and the post-socialist period, in their schema, were marked by downward mobility and increased spatial segregation of Roma communities in Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. It is in the context of these cycles that patterns of environmental exclusion have come into being. More than 50 years after the social dislocations of [[Second World War|World War II]] and the communist regime change, poor Roma settlements throughout the region are located on the outskirts of villages, separated from the majority population by roads, railways or other barriers, and disconnected from water pipelines and sewage treatment.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|262}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In analyzing environmental marginalization of Romani communities in Romania, anthropologist Enikő Vincze writes that "Environmental racism functions at the intersection of polluting the natural milieu, and of marginalizing social categories inferiorized by racial identification."&lt;ref name=Vincze/&gt;{{rp|391}} Throughout Central and Eastern Europe, Romani people themselves are often treated as environmentally problematic subjects.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;{{rp|262–3}} Slovak authorities have been criticized by Romani rights activists over the alleged practice of "targeting Romani communities for forced evictions under the pretext of environmental law" by defining them as "waste dumps".&lt;ref name="Sinan"&gt;Gökҫen, Sinan. [http://www.errc.org/article/slovak-republic-targets-roma-homes-as-waste/4081 "Slovak Republic Targets Roma Homes as 'Waste.{{'}}"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715173219/http://www.errc.org/article/slovak-republic-targets-roma-homes-as-waste/4081 |date=July 15, 2017}} European Roma Rights Centre. December 20, 2012. n. pag. Web. April 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Europe, there have been documented cases within popular culture whereupon Romani populations are characterized as ecologically irresponsible. In Slovakia, the region near the transportation corridor between [[Prešov District|Prešov]] and [[Poprad]] is an important foraging area for Romani communities who collect mushrooms and berries during the summer for trade and direct consumption.&lt;ref name=Richard&gt;Filčák, Richard. ''Living Beyond the Pale: Environmental Justice and the Roma Minority.'' Budapest: Central European University Press, 2012. Project MUSE. p. 5-163. Web. April 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}} The activity is particularly significant due to the poor living conditions of many Romani in the area, who frequently take part in the illegal harvesting of state and private agricultural lands.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|126}} In 2006, a "popular magazine" published an article titled "Grasshoppers: While Roma from Tatra Region Make Money on Forests, Bears are Getting Hungry".&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|126}} In the article, it was alleged that due to Romani foraging, Slovak bears could not find sufficient food to survive the winter.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|127}} Similarly, K. Harper et al write that Romani people in Hungary are viewed by majority culture as a group that "lacks environmental awareness" while simultaneously being "dissociated from any timeless connections to land":&lt;blockquote&gt;Contemporary environmental discourses tend to portray marginalized and indigenous people in either of two ways: as noble savages or as environmental profligates (Krech, 1999). Unlike indigenous people, however, the Roma in Hungary are not associated with a timeless, revered 'environmental ethic'—perhaps because they were excluded from owning land (Csalog, 1994). In fact, the most destitute Roma have been chided for their short-sighted use of environmental resources: heating the house with forest wood and parts of the house itself (Ladányi and Szelényi, 2006 ...), engaging in extremely hazardous scrap metal processing and allegedly overharvesting snowdrop flowers to sell in the city. While many observers acknowledge the structural inequalities and histories underlying Roma communities' rural and post-industrial indigence, the fact remains that non-Roma widely see the Roma as a group that profoundly lacks environmental awareness.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;{{rp|263}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Lithuania===
According to a report by RAXEN, overall housing quality for Romani persons in [[Lithuania]] is of poor quality and "often located in disadvantaged places in terms of infrastructure."&lt;ref name="LithuaniaR"&gt;Centre of Ethnic Studies Institute for Social Research. "[http://fra.europa.eu/en/country-report/2009/country-reports-housing-conditions-roma-and-travellers Lithuania RAXEN National Focal Point Thematic Study Housing Conditions of Roma and Travellers]." Centre of Ethnic Studies Institute for Social Research, ''Racism and Xenophobia Network (RAXEN)''. European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights: March 2009. Web. p. 1-68. Retrieved July 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36}} At the Romani settlement of [[:lt:Kirtimai|Kirtimai]] in [[Vilnius]], RAXEN has documented concerns regarding the quality of access to utilities such as water and heating, stating:&lt;ref name=LithuaniaR/&gt;{{rp|36}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The issue of Roma housing quality is most evident in the Kirtimai settlement, where dwellings do not meet standards in terms of heating, outdoor toilets, water pumps and limited access to public transportation. The Kirtimai settlement was equipped with basic amenities such as water, electricity and waste collection in 2001, and further – perhaps final – developments were carried out in early 2004.&lt;ref name=LithuaniaR/&gt;{{rp|36}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The settlement is located on the outskirts of Vilnius, spatially isolated within an industrial area in close proximity to [[Vilnius International Airport]].&lt;ref name=LithuaniaR/&gt;{{rp|29}} An estimated 500 persons inhabit the settlement, which has been described by RAXEN as arguably "ghettoised and discriminated against with regard to housing opportunities".&lt;ref name=LithuaniaR/&gt;{{rp|29}} With regards to the nationwide status of utilities access for Lithuanian Romani persons, RAXEN has concluded that "In general, a significant portion of the Roma lives in sub-standard dwellings, and there are Roma families throughout the country who have no access to public utilities (mainly sanitary facilities, water, and electricity)."&lt;ref name=LithuaniaR/&gt;{{rp|32}}

===Poland===
====Access to water and electricity====
While Romani settlements in [[Poland]] are distributed throughout the country and less segregated than many areas of Central and Eastern Europe, geographical isolation remains a concern with regards to the access of environmental means of sustenance.&lt;ref name="RAXENpoland"&gt;Mikulska, Agnieszka and Hall, Dorota. "[http://fra.europa.eu/en/country-report/2009/country-reports-housing-conditions-roma-and-travellers Poland RAXEN National Focal Point Thematic Study Housing Conditions of Roma and Travellers]." Warsaw, Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, ''Racism and Xenophobia Network (RAXEN)''. European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights: March 2009. Web. p. 1-60. Retrieved July 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} According to a report by RAXEN,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The majority of Roma settlements [in Poland], e.g. in the region of [[Małopolska]] are outside other settlements and are deprived of potable water, sewage and roads that allow for ambulance access. The problem also concerns roadblocks to obtaining settlement permits, especially in city centres, which necessarily results in them moving to the outskirts, away from infrastructure that allows for decent living conditions."&lt;ref name=RAXENpoland/&gt;{{rp|27}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to the study, Romani persons throughout Poland, especially those from the Bergitka subgroup, face ongoing issues with regards to accessing water and utilities&lt;ref name=RAXENpoland/&gt;{{rp|5}}{{rp|25–26}} which has been attributed to detrimental health conditions and persistently high rates of tuberculosis.&lt;ref name=RAXENpoland/&gt;{{rp|27}}

====Wrocław====

In 2013, an estimated 80–120 persons of Romanian Romani origin were living in two shantytowns in [[Wrocław]].&lt;ref name="Jupowiecka"&gt;Jupowiecka, Ewa.

After receiving a municipal order to evacuate the Kamieńskiego Street shantytown in April 2013, residents wrote a letter to the mayor of Wrocław, [[Rafał Dutkiewicz]].&lt;ref name=Jupowiecka/&gt;{{rp|163–5}} The letter reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We feel residents of this city [sic]. We have nowhere to move to. Could we count on support and advice on where else we could settle down? We realize that we might be cumbersome neighbors to the inhabitants of Kamieńskiego St., because there are many of us here and we often ask them for help … If there were any jobs for us, we would gladly take them and dedicate ourselves to the development of and work for the city of Wrocław. What we only ask is, please give us a chance. We want to stay in Wrocław and integrate with the city's society. (Żuchowicz, 2013, p. 2)&lt;ref name=Jupowiecka/&gt;{{rp|163–5}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Citing begging, trespassing, complaints from neighbors, disturbance to the area, and littering, alongside health and sanitation initiatives previously delivered by the city, the Social Affairs Department rejected residents' requests, concluding that clearing of the site was required.&lt;ref name=Jupowiecka/&gt;{{rp|163–5}} In the words of Jupowiecka, the response letter stated that the Roma presence produced an actual epidemiological hazard, and could no longer be tolerated".&lt;ref name=Jupowiecka/&gt;{{rp|163–5}} According to Kostka in 2014, "In Poland this is an unprecedented case, without jurisprudence, and can potentially have a huge impact on the Polish legal system and the image of Poland across Europe (Nomada 2013)."&lt;ref name=kostka/&gt;{{rp|29}} On July 22, 2015, the Kamieńskiego Street settlement was demolished.&lt;ref name="nomada2"&gt;Nomada.

In 1997, severe flooding took place, following which the area was declared uninhabitable due to the dangers of flooding.

[[File:LunikIX.jpeg|thumb|Roma settlement Luník IX in Košice, Eastern Slovakia]]In Slovakia, many Romani were settled by the fourteenth century.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt;{{rp|47}} In 1927, a new Act on Nomadic Roma came into place, whose statutes dictated that nomadic Romani were not to settle in locations of their choosing, but as selected by the mayors of villages.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt;{{rp|48}} During the Second World War, thousands of Slovak Romani were transported to [[extermination camp]]s in [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt;{{rp|48–9}}

Following the war, Romani were largely left out of postwar land redistribution schemes.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;{{rp|255}} One of the first laws created by the postwar government was the 'Directive on Governing Certain Conditions of Gypsies,' which states that "In villages where they [Roma] have dwellings in proximity to public, state-owned and other roads, the dwellings will be removed, placed separately from the village on distant places selected by the village."&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt;{{rp|48–9}} The implications of this law was that Romani communities, recently liquidated by the [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]] and without resources to purchase land, were now subject to the settlement plans of non-Romani decision-makers.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;{{rp|255}}

After initially treating Romani as "non-workers existing 'outside the [[Social class|class system]]'",&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|255}} socialist governments created policies that led to the rapid integration of Romani communities into the industrial labour force.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|255}} In spite of official socialist policies of equality, social divisions and social stratification remained. Romani communities experienced poverty emerging from the market transition, as well as significant vulnerability to environmental issues and harms associated with industrialization.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|255}}
[[File:Richnava11Slovakia11.jpg|thumb|Romani settlement at Richnava.]]
During the mid-1950s, research was conducted by the Slovak government determining that there were 1,305 segregated Romani [[shanty town|shantytowns]] throughout Slovakia.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|49}} In 1965, after failed attempts at economic and social integration, the Slovak government began to attempt more drastic policies aimed at assimilation of the Romani body politic.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|49–50}} Directed primarily at Romani settlements in Eastern Slovakia,&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|50}} these policies sought to create employment for all able-bodied Romani, particularly Roma males; termination of Romani shantytowns and resettlement into modern housing; and programs to support Romani students accessing formal education.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|50}} In spite of these policies, shantytowns only decreased in number slowly;&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|51}} after the resettlement program was terminated as a result of post-socialist funding shortages, shantytowns began to grow again, largely due to economic conditions.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|64}} By 2004, there were an estimated 320,000 Romani individuals living in Slovakia in 1,575 "integrated and segregated settlements."&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|257}}

[[File:Richnava11Spis3.JPG|thumb|Alternative view of deforestation above Romani houses, Richnava.]]
 
As these settlements have grown, impoverished Romani communities became more visible, land has become scarce, and tensions with non-Romani communities have risen.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|64}} The environmental implications of this scenario have been that these communities have been marginalized onto environmentally problematic parcels of land,&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|64}} where patterns of environmental issues entail exposure to hazardous waste and chemicals, vulnerability to floods, limited access to potable water, and discriminatory waste management practices.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|152}} The rapid growth of these settlements&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|64}} in a context where freedom of settlement and movement is restricted due to discrimination from the majority population&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|37}} has complicated property rights and entitlements&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|64}} and hence the legal ability to participate in land-based decision-making.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|41–3}}

====Evictions====
On October 30, 2012, 150 people were evicted from their homes in the district of Nižné Kapustníky ([[Košice|Kosice]]).&lt;ref name=Sinan/&gt; Further evictions were planned for 200 people from the Pod Hrádkom neighbourhood of [[Prešov]] under similar legal circumstances.&lt;ref name=Sinan/&gt; According to the [[European Roma Rights Centre]] (ERRC), these evictions are part of a growing trend in the Slovak Republic in which authorities are justifying evictions by designating Romani settlements as "communal waste".&lt;ref name=Sinan/&gt; Over 400 mayors of towns and villages in Slovakia have joined a movement by the name of Zobudme sa! (Let's Wake Up!) which, according to the ERRC, "aspires to coordinate a targeted programme of demolition aimed at Roma settlements by defining them as waste dumps".&lt;ref name=Sinan/&gt;

==== Rudňany ====

The region of [[Slovak Ore Mountains|Slovenské Rudohorie]] has a long industrial history, which includes [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], and other metal mining and processing, and has been listed as being one of the ten most polluted regions in Slovakia.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|73}}The region and mine tailings is contaminated with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], acidic water from [[Acid mine drainage|sulfide]], and [[lead]].&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|74–6}}

In the village of [[Rudňany]], there has been a Romani settlement situated on top of the abandoned factory site of Zabíjanec&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|69}} since the 1970s; after the site's closure in 1965&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|80}} it was likely settled with the "silent approval" of socialist authorities.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|77}} As of 2011, 640 persons lived there,&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|72}} in conditions severely contaminated by [[Toxic heavy metal|heavy metals]].&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|82}} Children at Zabíjanec are at particularly high risk of health effects, such as neurological damage.&lt;ref name=Steger/&gt;{{rp|21}}

By 2003, the number of industrial workers in the mines and processing plants had decreased from 2,500 at the start of the 1990s to 150.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|71}} In 2010, 1,700 out of Rudňany's 3,775 inhabitants were Romani, who are highly segregated from the majority population.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|72}} Many also live in the Pätoracké shantytown; according to Filčák, approximately 570 Romani were living there in 2011.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|72}} These Romani communities largely settled in the area during the 1950s to work as miners.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|76}}

In the 1970s, subsidence of structures above the mine shafts, along with encroaching contaminated mine waste compelled authorities to relocate residents from Pätoracké to new homes in [[Spišská Nová Ves]] and [[Smižany]].&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|78}} However, the Romani shantytowns were not relocated, nor were new Romani migrants prevented from settling in the area.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|78}} In 2007, in response to a sinkhole incident in 2001,&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|78}} 257 residents were relocated to new apartments, which while outside the landslide and subsidence danger zones, are still surrounded by dumps of mine waste, while also continuing to be ethnically segregated.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|79}} As of 2009, over 300 people remained in the danger zone, living in a shantytown without sewers, sewage treatment, running water, or garbage collection. Meanwhile, residents from the main village of Rudňany municipality regularly dispose of household waste in an unauthorized dump 300 meters below the Pätoracké settlement.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|135}}

==== Krompachy ====
[[File:Krompachy 16Slovakia98.jpg|thumb|Krompachy smelter]]
The Romani settlement in [[Krompachy]] has 400 residents,&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|135}} largely former employees of the nearby copper smelter.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|133}} Separated from the town of Krompachy by a road and a stream, the settlement is located at the foot of a hill next to the smelter.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|133}} Only several apartments in the settlement are occupied by non-Romani families, most of whom left the area over time.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|133–4}} The Krompachy smelter has been producing electrolytic copper in Slovakia since 1937, and is the only facility of its kind in the country.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|133–4}} According to measurements taken by the [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]], the area is highly contaminated with [[arsenic]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], and [[copper]], and there is unsubstantiated evidence to suggest that contamination may be more severe in the Romani settlement than in the town proper.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|134}}

==== Trebišov ====

In a Romani neighbourhood in the town of [[Trebišov]], there is a slaughterhouse and meat-processing plant. These facilities are the source of odours and waste which is stored in open containers in an unfenced location that is frequented by Romani people in search of food. Due to the rapid rate of decay of this unrefrigerated waste, especially during the summer, it poses a significant health risk for those who consume it, while also attracting insects and rats.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|135}}

==== Svinka River Watershed ====
[[File:Slovakia Sarisska highlands 321.JPG|thumb|Romani settlement near Chminianske Jakubovany, Prešov]]
The Romani shantytowns of [[Hermanovce nad Topľou|Hermanovce]], [[Jarovnice]], and [[Svinia]] are located within several kilometres of each other within the upper Svinka River Watershed;&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|99}} all three have histories of being subject to flooding.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|120}} Jarovnice, which has an unofficial population of 5,000,&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|109}} is one of the largest shantytowns in Slovakia.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|110}} Residents do not have access to safe, potable water.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|110}} Water quality in all three settlements has been problematic, particularly with regards to increasing [[nitrate]]s contamination from industrial fertilizers used by agricultural activity in the region.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|110–20}} In 1998, 47 people died in floods in the region; 45 of the victims were Romani, and 42 of them were from Jarovnice. One person from Svinia died, and 500 people from the shantytown had to be evacuated.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|123}} In Hermanovce, there is a Romani shantytown of 300 persons&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|107}} located on low-lying land with a high water table in between forks of the Svinka River;&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|107–8}} meanwhile, the village dump is located in close proximity above the shantytown, and is not lined to prevent [[leachate]] contamination, causing seepage into the community.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|108–9}} According to Filčák, the construction of a landfill "in close proximity to the Roma settlements, without involvement of the affected people is almost a 'classical' example of the environmental injustice in both distributional and procedural aspects".&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|129}}

In the words of Anna Husarova, a Romani woman from Jarovnice, the location of these settlements in relation to flood vulnerability has a historical context:&lt;blockquote&gt;[After the war] survivors had to settle next to forests, in the middle of fields or on riverbanks. These were the only places where they were allowed to settle down and start over. They built huts and began to call them flats. No attention was paid to them, and they were given no help.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt;{{rp|104}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other Romani settlements in [[Chminianske Jakubovany]], [[Petrova Lehota|Petrova]], and [[Markovce]] have also experienced vulnerability to flooding.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|152}}

=== Hungary ===

In Hungary, the proximity of Romani settlements to garbage dumps along with a lack of access to potable water and sanitation infrastructure has been an ongoing concern.&lt;ref name=Steger/&gt;{{rp|20–1}} In a Romani shantytown in [[Heves]], the recycling of car batteries from an unauthorized dump for income caused the death of one child and serious disabilities among a number of residents.&lt;ref name=Steger/&gt;{{rp|21}} In Hungary, it is believed that environmental health conditions contribute to the low life expectancy of Romani people, whose life expectancy is on average 10–15 years lower than for non-Romani.&lt;ref name=Steger/&gt;{{rp|21}}
[[File:Sajo-Sztpeter06.jpg|thumb|Sajó River near Sajószentpéter.]]

According to the European Roma Rights Centre, in Ózd-Bánszállás, Hungary, a situation exists where hundreds of Romani persons living in a segregated neighbourhood do not have reliable clean water access and must use three contaminant-risk pumps.&lt;ref name="ThirstingERRC"&gt;Szilvasi, Marek. "[http://www.errc.org/cms/upload/file/thirsting-for-justice-march-2017.pdf Thirsting for Justice: Europe's Roma Denied Access to Clean Water and Sanitation]." {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719102250/http://www.errc.org/cms/upload/file/thirsting-for-justice-march-2017.pdf |date=July 19, 2017}} ''European Roma Rights Centre''. March 2017. Web. p.1-45. Retrieved July 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}} According to the ERRC report,&lt;blockquote&gt;The town won a Swiss development grant some three years ago to improve water infrastructure but Roma neighbourhoods seem to have been omitted from this development plan. The young mayor is a member of the far-right [[Jobbik]] party.&lt;ref name="ThirstingERRC"/&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to 2010 data from Hungary's National Development Agency, 4.7% of predominantly Romani settlements did not have access to a public water supply (relying instead on makeshift wells and open water sources such as streams), and that a further 11.1% had access to public wells, but no access to tap water or sewerage.&lt;ref name="ThirstingERRC"/&gt;{{rp|22}} According to the United Nations Development Program's 2011 Regional Roma Survey, 30% of Romani households in Hungary did not have access to a "piped, public water supply and remained dependent on water where the quality was not tested by the competent public authorities".&lt;ref name="ThirstingERRC"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

Another region facing environmental issues is [[Sajószentpéter]]. A town of 14,000 near [[Miskolc]] in northeastern Hungary, it was a minor industrial center for the majority of the 20th century, namely in the production of coal and glass.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|259}} During the market transition from socialism, both the factory and the mine were closed down, causing the entire population of the town to lose its employment within the span of several months, without new economic development since.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|259}}

A Romani settlement in Sajószentpéter is located separately from the town in a nearby wetland, and is connected by a bridge.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|259}} Several issues of environmental injustice have been identified, such as illegal dumping in the Romani settlement by non-Romani as well as residents, as well as unequal access to green space, water distribution, sewerage, and housing quality.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|260}}

Following the formation of a grassroots community organization in the Romani settlement called the Sajó River Association for Environment and community Development (SAKKF), Romani and youth-led initiatives in partnership with outside activists have seen the development of ongoing environmental-justice oriented projects.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|259–62}} One project that resulted from these initiatives was the Romani youth-led photography exhibit, 'This is also Sajószentpéter' ('Ez is Sajószentpéter'), which was held at [[Central European University]] in June 2007.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;{{rp|261}}

===Ukraine===
====Access to water====
According to the [[UNECE]] pilot country reports on Equitable Access to Water (2013), 32% of Romani households in [[Ukraine]] have indoor water access, while 18% derive their water from open-air sources such as streams.&lt;ref name="ThirstingERRC"/&gt;{{rp|21}}&lt;ref name="UNECEpolandv"&gt;Ukrainian pilot project team; Vykhryst,  Rakhimova, Kravchenko, et al.

In addition to potential hazards regarding the radioactive history of the site, the settlement was approximately forty minutes away from the nearest source of water, so residents had to use water from a nearby sewage-contaminated stream.&lt;ref name=chiricliholosiivo/&gt;{{rp|20}}

====Zakarpats'ka Oblast====
Serious issues regarding access to clean water and sanitation for Romani communities (''tabors'') in [[Zakarpats'ka Oblast|Zakarpats'ka oblast]] have been documented.&lt;ref name="zakarpatska"&gt;Szilvasi, Marek and Navrotskyy Volodymyr. "[http://www.errc.org/blog/access-to-clean-water-for-roma-in-ukraine-a-grim-tale-of-local-barons-leaky-pipes-and-dry-wells/121 Access to clean water for Roma in Ukraine: a grim tale of local barons, leaky pipes and dry wells]." {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720123031/http://www.errc.org/blog/access-to-clean-water-for-roma-in-ukraine-a-grim-tale-of-local-barons-leaky-pipes-and-dry-wells/121 |date=July 20, 2017}} ERRC Blog.

Near the village of [[Myrcha]], 35 kilometres northeast of [[Uzhorod]], there is an isolated Romani settlement of 150 persons located next to a forest.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; The community does not have access to clean drinking water.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; Residents derive their drinking water from rainfall collection; during drier months, the residents have no choice but to collect water from a stream that allegedly "smells like chemicals", according to residents interviewed by the European Roma Rights Center.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; Authorities for the main village of Myrcha have cited legal and logistical challenges as barriers to providing water infrastructure to the settlement.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; In the words of the mayor, when interviewed by Szilvasi and Novrotskyy about improving water access for the Romani ''tabor'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;We want to help them, but the problem is the Ukrainian law, the tabor is beyond the village, we first need to include them in the cadaster (…) this [building the well] would need a geological investigation as well and involve much bureaucracy. The paper work would be greater than the work itself, and precludes us from even starting such a project.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Outside [[Berehove]], an estimated five to six thousand Romani persons live in a settlement with limited to no access to clean drinking water, and with no access to sewerage.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; There are three public taps available, however they are usually either turned off or non-functional.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; According to Szilvasi and Novrotskyy, a major part of the problem is the alleged corruption of the "baron" system, whereby unelected individuals from the Romani community are designated by municipal authorities to steward the water and sanitation infrastructure.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; Barons are granted significant sums of money for their role, with no system of oversight in place to ensure that services are delivered.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; The payouts are not tied to any quantitative water consumption by residents of the Romani community, resulting in a system where barons are effectively paid to neglect water and sanitation infrastructure.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt;

In Uzhorod, several thousand Romani persons live at five separate settlements throughout the city.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; Water and sanitation access varies, with some houses and neighborhoods having better services than others.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; Between 2013 and 2016, three of the tabors received new access to formal water utilities, although access often does not reach all houses due to limited infrastructure and low water pressure.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; Issues of water affordability for some residents persist, and the lack of reliable access has been documented as an ongoing fire hazard.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt;

Near [[Mukachevo|Muchaceve]], a Romani settlement of five thousand persons was serviced by a high-risk water supply that was contaminated and subject to major leakage.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; Following a hepatitis epidemic in the community in 2013, tests were ordered to track the origin of the outbreak.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; The water supply was confirmed as the source of the pathogens and was promptly shut off.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; No replacement water source was provided by the municipality.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; By 2016, a new above-ground pipe was constructed "with the support of international donors" to supply the settlement.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; In contrast to nearby Muchaceve, which receives water services 24 hours a day, the Romani settlement only receives water for four hours a day.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt;

In [[Chop, Ukraine|Chop]], both the Romani as well as majority-culture communities face issues regarding water resource sustainability.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; The city of Chop, as of 2016, is currently experiencing a dispute involving the Ukrainian national railway company, [[Ukrainian Railways]].&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; The state-owned corporation owns the entire water distribution infrastructure of Chop, and is responsible for its maintenance.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; Persistent issues of water contamination, leakage, and corrosion have reportedly been seriously neglected, prompting the municipality to attempt to take over ownership of the waterworks system.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt; The Romani settlement on the outskirts of the city has particularly limited access to water; even the houses that are connected to the utility receive such low-pressure in the pipes that residents rely on carrying water by hand from nearby wells.&lt;ref name=zakarpatska/&gt;

====Donetsk and Luhansk Oblast====
According to a 2014 report by ''Chiricli'', the situation for Romani persons within Ukraine's "[[ATO zone|Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) Zone]]" ([[Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast]]) was dire.&lt;ref name=chiricliholosiivo/&gt;{{rp|33}} Most Romani residents did not have reliable access to water, electricity, or food.&lt;ref name=chiricliholosiivo/&gt;{{rp|33}} According to one woman from [[Makiivka]], Romani residents would sometimes not be able to access water for as long as five days.&lt;ref name=chiricliholosiivo/&gt;{{rp|33}}

====Crimea====
According to ''Chiricli'', most Romani homes in [[Crimea]], including the city of [[Simferopol]], did not, as of 2014, have access to water or electricity.&lt;ref name=chiricliholosiivo/&gt;{{rp|25}}

According to the [[United Nations Development Program]]'s 2011 Regional Roma Survey, 66% of Romani households in [[Moldova]] did not have access to a "piped, public water supply and remained dependent on water where the quality was not tested by the competent public authorities".&lt;ref name="ThirstingERRC"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

=== Romania ===
Persistent patterns of environmental racism exist throughout [[Romania]], affecting the [[Romani people|Romani]] minority (not to be confused with the majority ethnic [[Romanians|Romanian]] population). These issues exist within a context of severe poverty. According to scholar Florin Botonogu, "Despite the clear provisions of the Romanian law forbidding human settlements close to garbage pits or other pollution sources, there are many communities in Romania situated in such an environment."&lt;ref name=Orta/&gt;{{rp|65}} Romanian scholar Catalin Berescu has in 2010 written that an estimated 2,000 shanty towns exist throughout Romania, inhabited by approximately 1 million individuals, 90 percent of whom are ethnic Romani.&lt;ref name=Orta/&gt;{{rp|92}} According to Berescu, the development of shantytowns has been a relatively recent phenomenon, only becoming visible since the fall of Communism.&lt;ref name=Orta/&gt;{{rp|92}}

In the opinion of Botonogu,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Maybe labeling this situation as racism, as nobody forces them to stay there, is not that obvious, but the fact that in the whole country only Roma communities live in these conditions and the tolerance of the cities to the huge health risks, child labour and general misery represents, for sure, a different treatment by the local authorities towards these groups. Truth is that they have no other option; they have been denied any other job or place to settle.&lt;ref name=Orta/&gt;{{rp|65}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the United Nations Development Program's 2011 Regional Roma Survey, 72% of Romani households in Romania did not have access to a "piped, public water supply and remained dependent on water where the quality was not tested by the competent public authorities."&lt;ref name="ThirstingERRC"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

According to Enikő Vincze, "the formation of the Cluj landfill as a space of precarious and stigmatized housing and labour, is a site of environmental racism".&lt;ref name=Vincze/&gt;{{rp|391}} Predominantly Romani neighbourhoods from throughout the city of Cluj have been evicted and relocated to the dump since 2002.&lt;ref name=Vincze/&gt;{{rp|394}} Many different Romani subgroups, further divided by family lines, have been settled into an area near the dump on Cantonului Street, causing inter-community tensions and violence.&lt;ref name=Vincze/&gt;{{rp|394}} In 2010, 300 residents of Coastei street were evicted and resettled at the dump near a chemical waste site.&lt;ref name=Vincze/&gt;{{rp|394, 402}}&lt;ref name=Ramsay/&gt; The newly vacated neighbourhood was subsequently transferred, for free, to the Archbishop of Feleac and Cluj for the purpose of constructing a campus for students of [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Orthodox Theology]] at the [[Babeș-Bolyai University|Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj]].&lt;ref name=Vincze/&gt;{{rp|402}}

In spite of the traumatic nature of the relocation,&lt;ref name=Vincze/&gt;{{rp|402}} the Romani community of Coastei Street, which was well integrated in the city and closely connected with urban services, engaged in organized efforts to maintain their social connections to Cluj (such as sending their children to their old schools in the city, and by organizing to ensure access to public transit).&lt;ref name=Vincze/&gt;{{rp|394, 402}} With support from NGO's such as the [[European Roma Rights Centre]] (ERRC), Working Group of Civil Organizations (gLOC), and [[Amnesty International]], these efforts, which included protests in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], culminated in the formal acquisition of land at Pata Rât.&lt;ref name=Vincze/&gt;{{rp|394}} On January 7, 2014, Cluj-Napoca County Court (Tribunal) ruled that the eviction and relocation from Coastei Street was illegal, ordering city authorities to compensate the Romani community for damages, and to also provide compensation for the inadequate housing situation caused by the relocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Gökҫen, Sinan|author2=Aroyo, Lydia|url=http://www.errc.org/article/romanian-court-victory-%E2%80%93-forced-eviction-of-roma-to-pata-r%C3%A2t-was-illegal/4239|title=Romanian Court Victory—Forced Eviction of Roma to Pata-Rât was Illegal|publisher=European Roma Rights Centre|date=January 7, 2014|accessdate=April 10, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715123135/http://www.errc.org/article/romanian-court-victory-%E2%80%93-forced-eviction-of-roma-to-pata-r%C3%A2t-was-illegal/4239|archivedate=July 15, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Miercurea Ciuc ====
In 2004, authorities in the city of [[Miercurea Ciuc]] relocated 100 Romani persons to a site with 12 shacks next to a sewage treatment plant, despite sanctions from the Romanian National Council for Combating Discrimination and the [[European Court of Human Rights|European Court for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Orta/&gt;{{rp|65}} The relocated persons at the settlement were only granted access to four public toilets in the settlement, and only one source for potable water.&lt;ref name=Orta/&gt;{{rp|65}} Insufficient barriers allowed children to access industrial equipment near the site, posing safety hazards.&lt;ref name=Orta/&gt;{{rp|80}} The plant also emits toxic gases, where warning signs posted surrounding the site explicitly state "Attention! Toxic gas."&lt;ref name="Steger"/&gt;{{rp|25–26}} Medically unconfirmed reports from residents claim that two infants have died as a result of the gases.&lt;ref name="Steger"/&gt;{{rp|25}}

The settlement was only accessible by dirt road, with no public transportation. By 2010, 150 persons were living at the site.&lt;ref name=Orta/&gt;{{rp|80}} The settlement was originally mandated to be temporary in nature, yet by 2010 it had been there for five years.&lt;ref name=Orta/&gt;{{rp|80}} At another settlement near Miercurea Ciuc, 25 people were documented in 2010 as living at or near a garbage pit near a stray dog facility, outside city limits.&lt;ref name=Orta/&gt;{{rp|81}} The inhabitants of this unnamed settlement did not have access to public transportation for sending their children to school; the sole source of employment was scavenging through garbage; and many of the inhabitants were documented as not having identity cards, making it impossible to access social insurance and subsidized health care.&lt;ref name=Orta/&gt;{{rp|81}}

==== Baia Mare chemical plant ====
On June 1, 2012, hundreds of Romani from the Craica ghetto of [[Baia Mare]] were forcibly relocated by local authorities to a former chemical laboratory at a decommissioned chemical factory.&lt;ref name=Lacatus&gt;Lacatus, George. [http://www.romatransitions.org/romanian-mayor-moves-hundreds-of-roma-to-a-decommissioned-chemical-factory/ "Romanian Mayor Moves Hundreds of Roma to a Decommissioned Chemical Factory"]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010082949/http://www.romatransitions.org/romanian-mayor-moves-hundreds-of-roma-to-a-decommissioned-chemical-factory/|date=October 10, 2016}} Roma Transitions. June 8, 2012. n. pag. Web. Retrieved April 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many observers viewed the relocation as an effort by Mayor [[Cătălin Cherecheș]] to gain popularity among racist elements of the electorate leading up to elections nine days later.&lt;ref name=Lacatus/&gt; This incident followed the 2011 construction of a six foot high wall, also instigated by Cherecheş, to encircle a Romani neighbourhood in Baia Mare.&lt;ref name=Lacatus/&gt; Cherecheş has stated that living conditions would be favourable to the Romani at the chemical plant compared to Craica, despite the former factory having a reputation among Romanians as a "plant of death" due to its status as the second-most polluting chemical facility in the country.&lt;ref name=Lacatus/&gt;

Within several hours of arriving on site, 22 Romani children and two adults began to exhibit symptoms of chemical poisoning, resulting in a major response by emergency personnel and evacuation of the sick to hospital.&lt;ref name=Lacatus/&gt; It is believed the poisoning was caused by containers of chemical substances which had been abandoned at the property.&lt;ref name=Lacatus/&gt; Shortly afterwards, on June 3, the mayor's mother, Viorica Cherecheş, also a physician and the director of a local hospital, arrived on scene with a police presence, and ordered the relocated Romani to collect, without any safety equipment, all of the remaining chemical containers.&lt;ref name=Lacatus/&gt;

According to Marian Mandache, executive director of the Romani rights organization [[Romani CRISS]], it is suspected that the action was to remove evidence of wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=Lacatus/&gt; On June 7, 36 Romani and non-Romani NGO's signed a letter to Romanian Prime Minister [[Victor Ponta|Victor Pona]] regarding the relocation, and held a protest outside the [[Palace of the Parliament|Romanian parliament]].&lt;ref name=Lacatus/&gt;

==== Other resettlements ====
In 2007, the city of [[Dorohoi|Dorohui]]-Centrul Vechi displaced 14–15 Romani families following the demolishment of a housing complex. These individuals were then planned to be relocated to a social housing facility located close to a wastewater treatment plant and an industrial estate.&lt;ref name="Steger"/&gt;{{rp|25}} Also in 2007, with funding from the [[European Commission]] (which has a financing policy that prohibits exclusionary forms of segregation) plans were developed to construct 20 houses for Romani within an industrial zone in [[Constanța]], with no access to nearby schools, limited transportation, and no community facilities.&lt;ref name="Steger"/&gt;{{rp|25}} Similar resettlements of Romani residents to environmentally problematic locations have taken place in [[Piatra Neamț|Piatra Neamt]], [[Oradea|Episcopia Bihor]], [[Bucharest]], and Salaj Silmeul Silvaniei, of which the former two cases had residents located near and on top of garbage dumps, respectively.&lt;ref name="Steger"/&gt;{{rp|26}}

=== Bulgaria ===
[[File:GypsyPartof-Filipovtsi.jpg|thumb|Romani district in Sofia.]]
According to Babourkova, Romani communities in [[Bulgaria]] have, in post-socialist times, been subject to "environmental injustices" such as unequal access to infrastructure, housing, and utilities.&lt;ref name=Babourkova&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Babourkova, Rosalina|title=The environmental justice implications of utility privatization: the case of the electricity supply in Bulgaria's Roma settlements|journal=International Journal of Urban Sustainable Development|volume=2|issue=1|pages=24–44|date=6 October 2010|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|doi=10.1080/19463138.2010.511029}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} Bulgarian electricity distribution was privatized between 2000 and 2005.&lt;ref name=Babourkova/&gt;{{rp|31}} Prior to the collapse of socialism, access to electricity was near-universal; inequalities in distribution began to emerge following privatization.&lt;ref name=Babourkova/&gt;{{rp|31}}  A number of Romani settlements throughout Bulgaria do not have any electrical services.&lt;ref name=Babourkova/&gt;{{rp|34}} Meanwhile, 89% of Romani persons in Bulgaria do not have access to clean water.&lt;ref name=Steger/&gt;{{rp|38}}

==== Fakulteta ====
In the Fakulteta district of [[Sofia]], a Romani ghetto estimated at 60,000 residents (the official figure is 15,000), housing is predominantly substandard, public transit is minimal, water supply and sewerage is limited, and the electrical network is inadequate and subject to frequent failures.&lt;ref name=Babourkova/&gt;{{rp|33–34}} In the poorest section of Fakulteta, Glavova [[mahala]], only one water outlet exists for 200 families.&lt;ref name=Steger/&gt;{{rp|42}} Until June 2003, medical services in the community were "non-existent".&lt;ref name=Steger/&gt;{{rp|40}} Because the city of Sofia does not provide garbage collection services, residents regularly burn their garbage and children have been documented burning old tires, causing them to be exposed to toxic gases which may contain carcinogens such as [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]].&lt;ref name=Steger/&gt;{{rp|42}} Another concern is the illegal dumping of solid and hazardous waste.&lt;ref name=Steger/&gt;{{rp|42}} Construction firms regularly dump potentially toxic waste in Fakulteta to skirt disposal regulations; a former green space in the settlement has been converted into an illegal disposal site.&lt;ref name=Steger/&gt;{{rp|42}}

==== Stolipinovo ====
In the Romani settlement of [[Stolipinovo]] in [[Plovdiv]], residents had their electricity shut off by the private [[Austria]]n utility company [[EVN Group]] in February 2002, due to the community's cumulative failure to pay utility bills since the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=Babourkova/&gt;{{rp|35}} Following the shutdown, protests and confrontations with police ensued, and the entire settlement had its electrical access reduced to the hours of 7pm to 7am, causing significant challenges for food storage and preparation.&lt;ref name=Babourkova/&gt;{{rp|35}} Babourkova argues that this incident is "a clear-cut case of distributional injustice towards the Roma population of Stolipinovo leading to a disproportionate health burden for local residents".&lt;ref name=Babourkova/&gt;{{rp|35–36}}

According to [[Amnesty International]], "[[Slovenia]] is a highly developed country and enjoys a GDP per capita above the average in the European Union", with nearly 100% access to clean water.&lt;ref name="SloveniaAI"&gt;Amnesty International.

In the words of ''UN Expert on Human Rights – Water and Sanitation'' Catarina de Albuquerque, speaking on June 1, 2010 regarding the situation for Slovenian Romani:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The consequences of this lack of access to water and sanitation are devastating for these communities. ... In one community with no access to water, the people drink from a polluted stream, or have to walk for 2 hours to obtain safe water. They collect the water in jerry cans to haul back to their homes. ... The situation is reminiscent of situations I have witnessed in much poorer countries and astonishing to observe in a country where so much has been achieved for the vast majority of the population.&lt;ref name=SloveniaAI/&gt;{{rp|42}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Croatia===
According to the United Nations Development Program's 2011 Regional Roma Survey, 35% of Romani households in [[Croatia]] did not have access to a "piped, public water supply and remained dependent on water where the quality was not tested by the competent public authorities".&lt;ref name="ThirstingERRC"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

==== The "We clean Serbia" campaign ====
Between 2009 and 2013, a national government-supported environmental campaign took place under the name "We clean Serbia".&lt;ref name="Schwab" /&gt;{{rp|2}} The campaign identified so-called "wild dumps" (open-air landfills with poor environmental controls) as the most significant pollution source in Belgrade, and sought to address ecological issues surrounding these dumps.&lt;ref name="Schwab"&gt;Schwab, Eva. (August 2015). "[http://www.rc21.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/E3.1-evaschwab.pdf Displacing and Disciplining Roma Waste Pickers in Belgrade. Who can become a rightful subject of the 'clean' and 'sustainable' city to come?]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006061355/http://www.rc21.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/E3.1-evaschwab.pdf |date=October 6, 2016}} Paper presented at RC21 International Conference: "The Ideal City: between myth and reality. Representations, policies, contradictions and challenges for tomorrow's urban life," Urbino, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

As part of the "We clean Serbia" campaign, the city government of Belgrade displaced 17 Romani slums that were on or near the dumps, which were formally classified as "unhygienic settlements".&lt;ref name=Schwab/&gt;{{rp|2}} These informal settlements, where residents worked as waste pickers, were largely the direct result of the [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav wars]]—especially the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo war]]—as most of the residents came to inhabit these settlements as internally displaced persons (IDP's), refugees, or repatriated refugees.&lt;ref name=Schwab/&gt;{{rp|2}} An estimated 75% of recycled materials in Serbia are gathered by informal waste pickers; however, this activity is illegal.&lt;ref name=Schwab/&gt;{{rp|5}}

Over 2,800 slum residents were displaced,&lt;ref name=Schwab/&gt;{{rp|2}} half of whom were settled into initially "temporary"&lt;ref name=Schwab/&gt;{{rp|3}} shipping containers on the outskirts of Belgrade; the other half were evicted from Belgrade altogether.&lt;ref name=Schwab/&gt;{{rp|2}} The container settlements have been criticized by [[economic anthropology|economic anthropologist]] Eva Schwab, who has argued that social services provided to residents are tied to problematic "contracts of use" which require residents not to store scavenged materials near their containers, and to be employed by the Public Utility Service for its own recycling programmes.&lt;ref name=Schwab/&gt;{{rp|3}} Under this system, Romani who do not comply are denied social services (such as education for their children) and face removal from their dwelling.&lt;ref name=Schwab/&gt;{{rp|3}} Municipal governments in Belgrade have also complained of poor infrastructure in the container settlements and have documented failure of low-quality water pipes, which has resulted in flooding that has caused significant disruption for neighbouring communities.&lt;ref name=Schwab/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}

==== Deponija ====
As of 2007, close to 1,000 persons in Belgrade were inhabiting the Romani settlement of [[Deponija, Belgrade|Deponija]] (which means "dumping site" in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]).&lt;ref name="Steger"/&gt;{{rp|43}} The settlement had been established in the 1970s situated on top of a former dump, which was officially shut down, gradually, in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Steger"/&gt;{{rp|43}}  Polluting factories surround the settlement.&lt;ref name="Steger"/&gt;{{rp|43}}  The primary livelihood of residents was recycling from garbage trucks hired to dump in the community, an activity which frequently led to the unintended accumulation of non-recyclable waste in the settlement.&lt;ref name="Steger"/&gt;{{rp|44}}  The community lacked clean water, sewage treatment, and utility connections.&lt;ref name="Steger"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

According to the European Roma Rights Centre, as recently as 2015 there was a large Romani settlement built above waste landfill on the outskirts of [[Tirana]] in Municipality 11 situated next to a "poisonous Tirana city lake".&lt;ref name="ThirstingERRC"/&gt;{{rp|27}} In absence of a reliable water system, residents obtained water from a private seller.&lt;ref name="ThirstingERRC"/&gt;{{rp|27}} During the frequent absences of this service, residents would obtain water from the lake, in spite of health concerns regarding its toxicity.&lt;ref name="ThirstingERRC"/&gt;{{rp|27}} Following an alleged robbery of a German tourist by a Romani individual from the area, the settlement was evicted in 2015.&lt;ref name="ThirstingERRC"/&gt;{{rp|27}}

According to the United Nations Development Program's 2011 Regional Roma Survey, 30% of Romani households in [[Albania]] did not have access to a "piped, public water supply and remained dependent on water where the quality was not tested by the competent public authorities".&lt;ref name="ThirstingERRC"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

The [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UNHCR]] relocated five hundred displaced Romani from [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovica]] to a camp in northern Kosovo&lt;ref name="Pellow" /&gt;{{rp|209}} located on top of an abandoned lead tailings site at the former [[Trepča Mines|Trepča mining complex]] in [[Kosovska Mitrovica|Kosovska]].&lt;ref name="Kata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Polansky" /&gt; In 2005, the [[World Health Organization]] stated that "the worst environmental disaster for children in the whole of Europe" was happening, declaring the camps unfit for human habitation and in need of immediate evacuation.&lt;ref name="Pellow" /&gt;{{rp|209}}
Prior to the war, the Romani community in Mitrovica was economically active. According to Skender Gushani of the Association for the Protection of Roma Rights Mitrovica 
[[File:Rudnik Trepča Zvečan.jpg|thumb|Trepča metallurgy facility]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;We [the Romani of Mitrovica] had shops, a market, restaurants, our own local government council with representatives, and we maintained our culture and traditions. We didn't have to go to town for anything because here we had everything we needed. In our neighbourhood we had technical equipments {{sic}}, car repair shops and masons ... 6000 of us had jobs at Trepca, the battery factory of Zvecan, where we smelted lead. There were also some among us, about 20 of us, who are well-educated and worked in the local government council.&lt;ref name="Kata" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Avdula Mustafa, an activist with the Roma and Ashkalia Documentation Center, the UNHCR promised that the refugee camps in Kosovska were only temporary, and would be closed within 45 days.&lt;ref name="Kata" /&gt; However, the UNHCR added a second and third camp, indicating no intention of relocating from the site.&lt;ref name="Kata" /&gt; The names of the three camps were Cesmin Lug, Kablare, and Osterode.&lt;ref name="Kata" /&gt; These camps were located on or near 500 tonnes of toxic waste.&lt;ref name="Kata" /&gt; Across the [[Ibar (river)|River Ibar]], there is a further 100 million tonnes of toxic [[slag]],&lt;ref name="Kata" /&gt; a legacy of mining and smelting activities at the Trepča complex whose operations spanned from 1927 to 2000.&lt;ref name="Kata" /&gt;

At these new settlements, living conditions were severely substandard. Constructed by the UNHCR in collaboration with Action by Churches Together, houses on the toxic sites were built with lead-painted boards,&lt;ref name="Polansky" /&gt; no working sewerage system, and no reliable sources of running water.&lt;ref name="Kata" /&gt; Residents lived in fear of violence from neighboring non-Romani communities, restricting their freedom of movement and ability to leave the camps.&lt;ref name="Kata" /&gt;

In 2000, the World Health Organization conducted the first round of blood tests of residents in the camps. Blood lead levels were so high that the WHO recommended immediate evacuation of the camps, as well as fencing off the sites to prevent future exposure.&lt;ref name="Polansky" /&gt; In 2005, the WHO conducted further tests which determined that levels of [[lead]] in the blood of children from the camps were the highest ever recorded among humans.&lt;ref name="Kata" /&gt;

Tests for [[lead poisoning]] among 60 children were administered by Dr. Miljana Stojanovich, a doctor working for the Institute of Public Health in Mitrovica, who later stated "I haven't heard of results like this from anywhere else in the world...such high lead-levels in blood from such a small area."&lt;ref name="Polansky" /&gt; The tests determined that most children had blood lead levels higher than 65 micrograms per deciliter, the highest Dr. Stojanovich's instruments could measure.&lt;ref name="Polansky" /&gt; Test samples sent to a lab in Belgium were re-taken in order to verify if such levels were even possible; the results confirmed that children tested held the highest concentrations of blood lead in medical literature.&lt;ref name="Morton" /&gt; 10 micrograms per deciliter is the threshold at which brain damage begins, including IQ loss, according to Dorit Nitzan, Director of WHO Serbia, who has stated that the camps constitute "one of the most serious public health disasters in modern Europe".&lt;ref name="Kata" /&gt;[[File:Trepça's factory ruins.JPG|thumb|Trepça's factory ruins]]In spite of concerns over lead exposure, the UNHCR decided to keep the camps open.&lt;ref name=Polansky/&gt; Shortly after receiving the 2000 test results, the UN built a jogging track and basketball court between two of the settlements, naming the area the "Alley of Health".&lt;ref name=Polansky/&gt; Signs in poorly translated English posted at the site by the UNHCR read&lt;blockquote&gt;ALLEY OF HEALTH – LENGTH OF ALLEY – 1500 METERS – INHALE THE ODOUR OF HEALTH – THERE ARE CHALLENGES AWAITING FOR YOU – WIN – SPIRIT IS HEALTHY IN HEALTHY BODY&lt;ref name="Polansky" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the opinion of Ilija Elezovich from the Kosovo Health Authority during a 2005 interview, "the danger is so great that it threatens to destroy one full generation of Roma children ... they [UNHCR] made a catastrophic mistake by building these camps. Nobody cared about the danger of this location. This is very tragic for everybody, but especially for the Roma inhabitants."&lt;ref name=Polansky/&gt;

According to a 2008 and subsequent 2009 interview with Avdula Mustafa, the UNHCR responded to intense international attention toward the case by publicly promoting a plan to move residents to a former French military barracks.&lt;ref name=Kata/&gt; However, this proposed site was only 50 meters away from one of the original settlements, and thus of minimal improvement in terms of environmental health effects.&lt;ref name=Kata/&gt; Romani activists such as Mustafa have speculated that the UNHCR was attempting to pressure residents into returning to their former homes, despite grave fears over their personal safety.&lt;ref name=Kata/&gt; Concern related to these allegations grew following withdrawals of international assistance including emergency medications used to mitigate lead poisoning among children and pregnant women.&lt;ref name=Kata/&gt; By 2005, 29 deaths had been recorded in the camps.&lt;ref name=Polansky/&gt; By 2012, that number had risen to approximately 100, most of them children.&lt;ref name=Morton/&gt; In 2012, 100 families were moved off the contaminated site, but 40 families remained.&lt;ref name=Morton/&gt;

According to Steger, "A high percentage of Gypsy and Traveller communities in the United Kingdom (UK) are located in areas that are fully unsuitable for living and raising families.

==== Barry's Council's Gander site ====
{{One source|section|date=November 2017}}
One location of particular concern has been Barry's Council's Gander site in West London, inhabited by [[Irish Travellers]]. As of 2004, the site was situated near a highway and next to an aggregate concrete factory, which was built in 1999, prior to the Travellers being moved onto the site by local authorities.&lt;ref name=Power/&gt;{{rp|45}} One survey determined that approximately half the residents felt that the site was unhealthy; since moving to the site, residents have reported skin rashes and abnormalities, [[asthma]], and breathing difficulties among infants.&lt;ref name=Power/&gt;{{rp|45–6}} One observer has stated[[File:Illegal waste disposal at Traveller halting site, Kingston-Upon-Hull, England.jpg|thumb|Illegal waste disposal at Traveller site, Hull.]]&lt;blockquote&gt;Maybe the asthma has a connection with the factory because you couldn't even see through the windscreen [on her car] with the dust on it. The general health of the Travellers on site is pretty good ... a lot of them are registered with the medical centre.&lt;ref name=Power/&gt;{{rp|46}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Communication between factory management and Traveller residents over health concerns and industrial operations plans has been described as being insufficient.&lt;ref name=Power/&gt;{{rp|45}} The settlement was subject to irregular or nonexistent garbage collection services, poor sewerage, rat infestations, and fire hazards.&lt;ref name=Power/&gt;{{rp|46}} Residents asked for either the factory to be shut down, or for themselves to be relocated to a different area of Gander.&lt;ref name=Power/&gt;{{rp|45}} At one meeting at the site in 2001, residents expressed a readiness to leave their traditional nomadic lifestyle by moving into houses, citing restrictive laws on travelling, frequent evictions, allegations of constant police harassment, and deteriorating health conditions at the Barry site.&lt;ref name=Power/&gt;{{rp|45}}

Dr. Colm Powers, who conducted a comprehensive report in 2004 on the social and health situation of Irish Travellers in England, has argued that pressure on Travellers to abandon their nomadic lifestyle constitutes a pressing human rights issue.&lt;ref name=Power/&gt;{{rp|46}} According to Powers, the pressure to settle is twofold, stemming from the perceived criminalization of travelling, combined with the arguably poor quality of camping locations.&lt;ref name=Power/&gt;{{rp|46}} Powers argues the process of settling into permanent housing is a traumatic experience for many Travellers, who can experience cultural challenges and further social marginalization. In the view of Powers,&lt;blockquote&gt;These twin pressures [of criminalization and poor camping sites] gives support to the painful and disturbing process of cultural breakdown that leads to assimilation into the most marginalised and excluded sections of society. Nomadism is usually recognised by settled society as the sole (or salient) ethnic qualifier for Travellers, so its criminalisation and eradication erroneously signals the cultural assimilation of Travellers and Gypsies. This 'blindness' to the depth, complexity and strength of Traveller culture leaves 'settled' Travellers with little sensitive health and welfare support when they are forced into settled accommodation and it is most needed. The inability or unwillingness of many institutional support agencies to engage actively, supportively and sensitively with settled Travellers is creating a well of discontent among many young settled Travellers that is already evident in the high levels of criminalisation particularly in the settled Irish Traveller population&lt;ref name=Power/&gt;{{rp|46}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Discrimination towards Romani and Travellers in Green Belt lands ====

January 21, 2015. Web. n. pag. June 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Justice Gilbart, sitting in London, Pickles had "unlawfully discriminated" against Romani communities seeking to establish camping sites in [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|Green Belt]] lands by systematically delaying and overturning their development proposals.&lt;ref name="Press Association"/&gt; According to Romani activists, "local councils have consistently failed to earmark land for potential sites in local plans, and many Gypsies and Travellers have bought land, including in the green belt, to develop sites for themselves".&lt;ref name="Press Association"/&gt; Yet, according to Justice Gilbart, Pickles had created a policy in 2013–2014 that systematically turned down development appeal requests by "Romani Gypsies" and "Travellers".&lt;ref name="Press Association"/&gt; This policy was found by Justice Gilbart to be a protocol "which discriminated against a racial group".&lt;ref name="Press Association"/&gt;

The planning minister, [[Brandon Lewis]], responded to the ruling by stating "The government's planning policy is clear that both temporary and permanent traveller sites are inappropriate development in the green belt. Today's judgment does not question that principle."&lt;ref name="Press Association"/&gt;

The [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] responded to the ruling by stating "We have a duty to protect everyone from discrimination and ensure that the law is applied fairly, consistently and equally for all. We understand the need to be sensitive about green belt development but this should not be used to single out individuals for unlawful discrimination. Planning decisions should be taken on the merits of an application, not the characteristics of the applicant."&lt;ref name="Press Association"/&gt;

===== Dale Farm Romani and Traveller settlement =====
[[File:Dale Farm Demolition, 2011.jpg|thumb|Demolition of house, Dale Farm 2011.]]
The eviction of [[Dale Farm]] in [[Essex]],&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt; a camp settlement formerly home to approximately 1,000 Romani and Travellers on [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|Green Belt]] land has been highlighted as a case of racially motivated marginalization.&lt;ref name="Staniewicz, Teresa"/&gt;{{rp|71}} The camp, located on a former scrap metal yard, had been inhabited by Romani and Travellers since the 1960s; however, despite ownership of the land, residents were denied zoning permits to develop the property.&lt;ref name="Staniewicz, Teresa"/&gt;{{rp|71}} Illuzzi argues that in 2011, "expulsions and legal battle over the status of Dale Farm in the UK highlighted yet another confrontation over the illegality of Roma/Traveller behavior when they legally purchased 'green belt' land and were denied permits from the town council to build on that land. Town councils continue to work against allowing Traveller settlements in or near their towns."&lt;ref name=Illuzzi&gt;Illuzzi, Jennifer.

==== Historical documentation (Mitcham Common) ====
Instances of racialized marginalization within an environmental context have been documented in the United Kingdom dating back to the late 1800s. According to Mayall, the district of Mitcham was subject to spatial segregation of transient populations, including Romani and Traveller groups (referred to as "Gypsies"):
&lt;blockquote&gt;As we have noted, certain locales appear to lend themselves to housing a transient population: [[Mitcham, London|Mitcham]] on the borders of [[South London]] and [[Surrey]] was one such place. By the late 19th century Surrey was a main centre for Gypsies, itinerants and vagrants with an estimated (though probably exaggerated) 10,000 in the county alone, many of whom had been expelled from London through a combination of 'the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], land agents, sanitary authorities, and building developments.' (Mayall, 1988, pp 158-9).&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, David M. and Greenfields, Margaret. ''Gypsies and Travellers in Housing: The Decline of Nomadism''. Bristol, UK: Policy Press, University of Bristol, 2013. Print. p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Smith and Greenfields note the link between poverty, upper-class departure (for the United States context, see [[white flight]]) and the demographic presence of Romani and Traveller communities in Mitcham, as well as the economic prominence of environmentally polluting 'dirty industries' within the community. In the words of Smith and Greenfields,

[[File:Essential Oils Distillery Explosion, Mitcham March 30, 1933.jpg|thumb|W.J. Bush &amp; Co distillery explosion aftermath.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mitcham had long been one of the poorest parishes in Surrey and records of Gypsies camping in the area date back to the 1700s. Between the mid-19th and early 20th centuries the area declined in respectability as several landowning families departed and its population grew significantly as outward migration from London increased the population of poor and displaced residents (Smith, 2005, p 67). Of these, Gypsies and itinerants formed a significant minority: the 1881 census records 230 Gypsies and vagrants camping on Mitcham Common … [Mitcham] contained an abundance of market gardens which provided regular seasonal employment with the locality becoming an important site for industry in the early to mid-20th century, particularly the 'dirty industries' such as paint making, chemical works and bone boiling, which had been expelled from inner London by the 1845 Health Act. The importance of Gypsy labour to the area's industry in this period is revealed by Montague, who notes that … when Purdom's [paint and varnish] factory was originally established production had been seasonal, taking place mainly in the winter months when Gypsy and other casual labour employed on the physic gardens during the rest of the year was available at very low rates. (Montague, 2006, p 79)&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;{{rp|67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1909, over 190 vans were documented as being situated at Mitcham Common, along with numerous others at sites nearby, in spite of efforts to displace nomadic residents through by-laws such as the Mitcham Common Act of 1891.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;{{rp|67–8}} In the words of Smith and Greenfields, the urban area of Mitcham became a district where&lt;blockquote&gt;Gypsies had moved into the small terraced houses that were known locally as 'Redskin Village' (in reference to the dark colouring of its inhabitants) by the 1920s. According to Montague, by the 1930's the area had become one of the most disreputable and notorious in the district and was 'associated in the public mind with some of the worst slums in the emerging township' (Montague, 2006, p 113).&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|67–8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Ireland ===
[[Irish Travellers|Travellers]] in [[Ireland]] have a documented history of experiencing racism within an environmental context, particularly with regards to hazardous working conditions in the metal recycling sector.&lt;ref name=Helleiner&gt;{{cite book|author=Helleiner, Jane|title=Irish Travellers: Racism and the Politics of Culture|location=Toronto|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145–150}} According to research conducted in 2010 by the ''All Ireland Traveller Health Study'', approximately 2,700 Irish Travellers lacked access to running water, out of a total Traveller population of 36,224 in the Republic of Ireland and 3,905 in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="SorchaandHolland"&gt;Pollak, Sorcha &amp; Holland, Kitty.

According to a 2008 report on Traveller housing conditions by the Centre for Housing Research, 82.5% of housing locations (namely group housing facilities and caravan or halting sites) were found to be situated with "some form of environmental hazard nearby".&lt;ref name=Treadwell-Shine&gt;{{cite report|author1=K.

As a distinct ethnic group, Travellers in Ireland are subject to racism, in spite of their physical appearances. According to [[Canadians|Canadian]] sociologist Jane Helleiner, "some of the first challenges to a model of Southern Ireland as ethnically homogeneous and free of racism came from activists concerned with the status of Travelling People ... The identification of Travellers as an ethnic group has been a central premise of the human rights and community development work of Traveller advocacy organizations from at least the 1980s, and these groups by naming the discrimination and exclusion experiences by Travellers as a form of Irish racism have been influential in injecting the term into Irish political discourse (McVeigh 1996: 9)." According to Helleiner, "For some activist-scholars ... anti-Travellerism is understood as a form of 'racism without race'—i.e., a form of inferiorized difference that does not invoke biological inferiority, but rather notions of undesirable cultural difference (see Anthias citing Balibar 1995: 294)."&lt;ref name=Helleiner/&gt;{{rp|4}}

==== Galway city dump ====

During the early 1980s, [[Galway|Galway City]] began to experience significant economic growth. According to Helleiner (2000), "In the early 1950s the central government prompted internationally financed industrial development in the Galway region, and by the mid-1960s the city was specifically targeted for investment and provided with industrial estate (Ó Cearbhill and Cawley 1984: 258-9) ... Galway City has continued to see tremendous economic, demographic, and spatial growth associated with international investment in industry and service sectors and a vigorous tourist trade."&lt;ref name=Helleiner/&gt;{{rp|15}} However, according to Helleiner, social and economic inequalities have persisted in the region.&lt;ref name="Helleiner" /&gt;{{rp|15}}

Travellers continue to engage in informal and self-employed labour, particularly metal recycling and car scrapping, as this type of employment supports "an independent and nomadic way of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Pietarinen, Kati|url=http://gef.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Roma_and_Traveler_Inclusion.pdf|title=Roma and Traveller Inclusion in Europe.

The work at the dump was organized by informal means, as described by Helleiner: "Gaining and keeping a regular position at the dump depended on having close kinship or affinal ties to those already established."&lt;ref name=Helleiner/&gt;{{rp|148}} Also, scrap metal collection involved logistical challenges of transporting product, and the need for capital investments such as vehicles.&lt;ref name=Helleiner/&gt;{{rp|147}} In spite of the health risks (including cleaning the metal by burning off non-metallic material)&lt;ref name=Helleiner/&gt;{{rp|148}} and capital investments entailed in this work, Travellers were economically disadvantaged by fluctuations in prices set from scrap metal merchants.&lt;ref name=Helleiner/&gt;{{rp|149}} According to Helleiner &lt;blockquote&gt;Travellers were in a vulnerable position in this exchange as the prices for scrap were set by larger forces of demand and supply and bore no relationship to the amount of labour involved. There were few ways for Travellers to alter the terms of trade to their advantage. Most, for instance, had little withholding power as they lacked sufficient space on which to stockpile scrap in anticipation of higher prices ... This particular form of 'self-employment,' then, was dependent upon unequal exchanges over which Travellers had little independent control.&lt;ref name="Helleiner" /&gt;{{rp|149}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Romani settlements and e-waste ====
There is evidence to suggest that [[Romani in France|Romani communities in France]] may be experiencing environmental discrimination through exposure to e-waste contamination. According to a 2010 investigative report by ''[[The Ecologist]]'' written by Carolyn Lebel, some Romani people in France have been compelled by "poverty and discrimination" to become involved with the scavenging of electronic waste ([[Electronic waste|e-waste]]), handling an unknown quantity of the 750,000 tonnes of French e-waste that annually disappears into informal disposal and recycling networks.&lt;ref name="Lebel"&gt;Lebel, Carolyn.

Contently: Carolyn Lebel. October 12, 2010. Newsletter 17, p.6-10. Web. April 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to allegedly discriminatory employment regulations in France, many Romani find it impossible to gain formal employment.&lt;ref name=Lebel/&gt; As a result, many have turned to clandestine recycling operations of e-waste in slums outside large French cities.&lt;ref name=Lebel/&gt; At these sites, e-waste is broken into various types of metals, such as [[Aluminium|aluminum]], [[copper]], [[iron]], and [[lead]]. Copper is extracted from cables by burning them in open fires, while car batteries are melted down for lead and refrigerators are sent through car crushers without removing cooling agents, which can release up to four tonnes of [[greenhouse gas]]es into the atmosphere per unit.&lt;ref name=Lebel/&gt;

According to the observations of Dr. Bernard Moriau, "[The Romani] would work directly above these clouds of black smoke", in reference to Romani people he witnessed working in a forest in the [[Val-d'Oise|Val d'Oise]] region near [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=Lebel/&gt; In 2008, contamination from cancer-causing heavy metals was found in an evicted Romani camp near [[Lyon]]; likewise, this finding was preceded by a 1998 study in [[Bordeaux]], [[Annecy]], and [[Toulouse]].&lt;ref name=Lebel/&gt; The study, conducted by [[Médecins du Monde|Doctors of the World]] and local NGOs, identified abnormal lead exposure in fifty percent of children at the camps.&lt;ref name=Lebel/&gt; Furthermore, one-quarter of the children examined were identified as having [[lead poisoning]].&lt;ref name=Lebel/&gt; In a 2010 case, 19 children at a site in Lyon were found to have high blood lead levels.&lt;ref name=Lebel/&gt;

According to Dr. Jean-Claude Guiraud, thousands of children in France living at or near illegal recycling sites are at risk of lead exposure, which, according to Guiraud "can cause permanent damage to all the organs including the brain".&lt;ref name=Lebel/&gt; In spite of these statistics, the issue, as of 2010, has received little attention from authorities in France.&lt;ref name=Lebel/&gt;

==== Illegal mushroom harvesting ====
Since 2004, there has been criticism of Romanian and Bulgarian [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] who allegedly out-compete French locals in the wild [[Mushroom hunting|mushroom picking]] industry.&lt;ref name="MushroomHarvest"&gt;Rubin, Alissa J. ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/28/world/europe/mystery-of-missing-mushrooms-leaves-french-blaming-roma.html Mystery of Missing Mushrooms Leaves French Blaming Roma.]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214175751/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/28/world/europe/mystery-of-missing-mushrooms-leaves-french-blaming-roma.html |date=February 14, 2017}} The New York Times. November 27, 2013. Web. n. pag. Retrieved February 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern European harvesters, a large number of whom are believed to be ethnic Romani, have removed significant quantities of [[Boletus edulis|porcini]] and [[Milk-cap|milk cap]] (''[[Lactarius deliciosus]]'') mushrooms for export to Spain, allegedly emptying forests of mushroom supplies.&lt;ref name=MushroomHarvest/&gt; These predominantly Romani pickers have been accused of harvesting improperly, allegedly causing permanent damage to the forest ecosystem and destroying future mushroom yields.&lt;ref name=MushroomHarvest/&gt;

According to Thomas Kuyper, "professor of fungal ecology and diversity at [[Wageningen University and Research Centre|Wageningen University]] in the Netherlands", there is no scientific evidence of improper harvesting methods causing damage to future mushroom yields.&lt;ref name=MushroomHarvest/&gt; Kuyper suggests that the allegations were a result of xenophobia rather than evidence-based observations, and that there is a history of similar accusations in Germany and the Netherlands in response to migrant harvesters.&lt;ref name=MushroomHarvest/&gt; In Slovakia in 2006, accusations were published claiming that Romani mushroom harvesters in the Tatra region were responsible for an alleged lack of forage for bears.&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;{{rp|126}}

Large numbers of predominantly Romani workers have been reportedly harvesting without proper licenses (although no documentation exists as to the exact number of whom are ethnic Romani).&lt;ref name=MushroomHarvest/&gt;  According to Jean Louis Traversier of the French Forest Service, an estimated 80 percent of 2013 mushroom harvests in the southeastern [[Drôme]] and [[Ardèche]] regions were both legally and illegally picked by Bulgarian and Romanian nationals who had crossed into the region from Spain.&lt;ref name=MushroomHarvest/&gt;

Quality control concerns have been raised by vendors about the traceability of supplies, with fears that unregulated sourcing may pose a health risk for consumers of the mushrooms.&lt;ref name=MushroomHarvest/&gt;  According to facts provided by Traversier, a legal harvest in 2004-2005 involving a Spanish company was followed in later years by unauthorized picking.&lt;ref name=MushroomHarvest/&gt;  In the words of journalist [[Alissa J. Rubin]], in 2013

{{quote|about a thousand workers from Romania and Bulgaria came into the region by night in minivans or small trucks stacked high with empty boxes ... they parked on narrow local roads and slipped into the forests or hiked to the high plateaus and camped for as long as three weeks, building makeshift campsites and rising in the damp, chilly mornings to hunt for wild mushrooms. They hid their haul in the woods, and trucks came by each evening to pick them up.&lt;ref name=MushroomHarvest/&gt;}}

While supplying a high-priced culinary delicacy, wages for illegal mushroom harvesters are extremely low.&lt;ref name=MushroomHarvest/&gt;  In describing the issue of illegal harvesting, Traversier expressed concern for the well-being of the pickers, stating that he felt many of the Romani harvesters were "picking to survive".&lt;ref name=MushroomHarvest/&gt;

In Bragança, in the far north of the country, Gall has described how "a community was kicked out of its camp by the authorities, who told them they could live in the garbage dump".&lt;ref name=Queiroz/&gt;

In Rio Maior, 85 kilometres north of [[Lisbon]], Gall has described a scenario in which "14 gypsy [Romani] families were placed in precarious wooden houses, on top of a hazardous coal mine and separated from the rest of the population by a dense forest".&lt;ref name=Queiroz/&gt;

According to Gall, one "extreme" case of discrimination can be found in Beja, 180 kilometres south of Lisbon, where Romani are settled in social housing constructed "with a separation wall, far from the urban centre and near a dog pound, whose sewage containing animal excrement runs through the housing project, with obvious consequences for the health of the inhabitants".&lt;ref name=Queiroz/&gt;

In the mid-1990s the Madrid government pursued initiatives to eliminate the shantytowns surrounding the city.&lt;ref name=Gonick/&gt;{{rp|8}} One such shantytown settlement, Los Focos, was the largest in Spain, and also composed predominantly of ethnic Romani (of Spanish nationality).&lt;ref name=Gonick/&gt;{{rp|8}} During this time, the municipal government, under the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|Popular Party]], set out to initiate plans for the relocation of Los Focos to Cañada Real Galiana, where 100 single-storey houses were to be constructed in immediate proximity to the Madrid garbage incinerator,&lt;ref name=Gonick/&gt;{{rp|8}} a dump, and an illegal pig farm.&lt;ref name=Ostalinda&gt;{{cite web|authors=Ostalinda; Ovalle; and Tatjana Peric (European Roma Rights Centre)|title=Case study: improving Roma housing and eliminating slums, Spain (Conference edition)|publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights|date=October 2009|pages=1–30|accessdate=July 10, 2016|url=https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/605-090210-ROMA_Housing_Case-final-ENES.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} In the opinion of Gonick,&lt;blockquote&gt;In such physical proximity, relocated bodies and the city's refuse would face certain, constant coexistence. The blatant disregard for the health and safety of this population betrays the state's racialized vision of their urban futures: like sacks of garbage, these residents represented blight on the city, to be discarded out of sight. Such alliances between bodies and filth are of course ancient tropes in the production of spaces of value and inequality (Douglas 1966; McClintock 1995).&lt;ref name="Gonick" /&gt;{{rp|8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the context of the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15 M movement]] and an increasingly unaffordable and inaccessible housing market, many people in Spain identified with the struggles of Cañada Real Galiana residents, and activism surrounding the community received significant support from individuals and groups of diverse backgrounds from within Spanish society.&lt;ref name=Gonick/&gt;{{rp|12–15}} Following a series of protests and social activism, a process of court battles took place over the continuing demolitions, centered on Article 47 of the Spanish Constitution which guarantees the right to housing.&lt;ref name=Gonick/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} In 2013, a landmark decision at the European High Court of Human Rights was delivered in favour of Cañada Real Galiana residents, effectively ending the demolitions and protecting the existence of the settlement under Spanish constitutional law.&lt;ref name=Gonick/&gt;{{rp|15}}

Following the decision, as part of an effort to improve the situation in the settlement, the regional government of Madrid negotiated with municipalities neighbouring Cañada Real Galiana to conduct a formal census of the settlement.&lt;ref name=Gonick/&gt;{{rp|16}} Contrary to earlier mainstream media reports that the settlement was overwhelmingly Moroccan, sixty percent of residents were found to be non-Romani Spaniards, with the remainder being a diverse group consisting of other ethnicities; also, the population of the settlement was determined to be 8,600 residents instead of 40,000 as some sources had earlier claimed.&lt;ref name=Gonick/&gt;{{rp|16}} While environmental racism and environmental inequality continue to be major issues in the settlement for many residents in certain neighborhoods, the census revealed an arguably complex picture of the social situation in Cañada Real Galiana.&lt;ref name=Gonick/&gt;{{rp|16}}

With regards to the Romani presence in Italy, legal scholar Jennifer Illuzzi uses a term called the "state of exception" to argue that liberal Italian legal contexts have historically created scenarios in which "Romanies are under intense scrutiny, but juridically invisible".&lt;ref name=Illuzzi/&gt;{{rp|7}} Illuzzi argues that as a result of the "state of exception", contemporary Romani communities in Italy become easily subjected to criminalization, denial of citizenship or national status, and social exclusion, notably in places such as government-implemented Nomad Camps.&lt;ref name="Illuzzi" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

In Italy today, many Romani settlements (including Nomad Camps) exist within segregated contexts where both environmental concerns (such as lack of clean water access, toxic waste exposure, and proximity to highways and industrial areas) and issues of criminalization are present.&lt;ref name=Orta/&gt;{{rp|74–75}}&lt;ref name=Terrapromessa/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty" /&gt;{{rp|5–26}} In [[Campania]], Romani residents have been involved in the mass burning of waste&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt; and have been housed in extreme proximity to a hazardous waste site that has been likened by one government official to [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] in terms of cleanup requirements and risk to human health.&lt;ref name=Mayr/&gt;

{{quote|Surely these landfills are perhaps the most dangerous for their potential environmental disaster and effects not only on the environment but directly on human health ...

They are all gases coming from the landfill. They transmigrate through the permeability of the soil and arrive into this pit where they find their way to come out in the air.

Ethnic Pakistani and Bangladeshi agricultural workers in Greece have been subjected to well-documented cases of marginalization and violence within an environmental context, producing food and economic revenue for the Greek economy while themselves facing precarious living conditions and workplace environmental hazards, such as extremely harsh temperatures inside greenhouses.&lt;ref name=DW/&gt; On the [[Peloponnese]], thousands of undocumented ethnic Bangladeshi workers work harvesting potatoes and strawberries for extremely low-subsistence wages, often finding themselves working "under conditions akin to modern-day slavery", according to a report by [[Deutsche Welle]].&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;Köhne, Gunnar.

In Nea Manolada, hundreds of [[South Asian]] workers have settled into informal agricultural settlements under severely substandard living conditions.&lt;ref name="DW" /&gt; Due to the Greek economic crisis, the migrants have arguably become increasingly important to the economy, performing vital agricultural jobs that are generally not performed by Greek citizens, many of whom face unemployment.&lt;ref name="DW" /&gt; Bangladeshi workers near Nea Manolada live in camps made of plastic and other scavenged materials, lacking water, sanitation, and adequate cooking facilities.&lt;ref name="DW" /&gt; In the words of a migrant worker and camp-dweller named Doulak, "We can't go back to Bangladesh, we don't have enough food or work there.

Ejaz Ahmed, a translator working with [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders (MSF)]], has stated that migrant agricultural workers in Nea Manolada are reportedly faced with many restrictions to freedom of movement, such as not being allowed to sit in the town square, being barred from cafes, not being permitted to go swimming at nearby beaches, and denied the option of renting houses.&lt;ref name="Skala" /&gt; Ejaz further added that workers are reportedly forced to live inside "chicken coups, warehouses, and derelict buildings".&lt;ref name="Skala" /&gt;

On July 1, 2014, the Pakistani Community of Greece, the Immigrant Workers League and the United Movement Against Racism and the Fascist Threat (KEERFA) held a press conference regarding alleged working conditions.&lt;ref name=Skala/&gt; Migrant agricultural workers publicly shared their experiences with workplace or work-related violence and the non-payment of wages.&lt;ref name=Skala/&gt;

In spite of local efforts to improve conditions for agricultural migrant workers and refugees, issues persist due to their undocumented status and lack of formal immigration paperwork, which can only be assigned by the Greek government.&lt;ref name="DW" /&gt; According to Doulak, migrants are subjected to regular police harassment due to a lack of documents granting legal status in Greece.&lt;ref name="DW" /&gt; According to Doulak, "The main problem is that we have no papers.

===Sweden===

According to the report "Inconvenient Human Rights: Access to Water and Sanitation in Sweden's Informal Settlements", the [[Sweden|Swedish]] state has, through international law, arguably aligned itself toward a legal responsibility of ensuring clean water access for all persons on Swedish territory.&lt;ref name="wallenbergromasve"&gt;Davis, Martha Frances and Ryan, Natasha.

Sweden faces persistent issues regarding non-provision of environmental means of sustenance to persons who have recently arrived from Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|14}} These inhabitants, who are predominantly Romani, are EU citizens who have come to Sweden legally.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|4}} Their experiences with denial of water access can arguably be viewed as part of a larger historical precedent of water, sanitation, and energy resource exclusion policy towards Romani persons in Sweden.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|10–2}}

In the opinion of Davis and Ryan, "Water and sanitation access for vulnerable EU citizens in Sweden cannot be accurately understood without the backdrop of historic discrimination against Roma populations."&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|10}} As detailed by a 2014 Swedish Government report titled "The Dark Unknown History" examining Swedish state abuses toward the Romani minority,&lt;ref name="darkunknownsve"&gt;Grönfors, Dimiter Taikon, et al.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Key players in this discrimination have been the [[Swedish government]], the [[Church of Sweden]], the [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] and the police. Over many decades, a major political justification for the control of Roma life was the need to rehabilitate the Roma. The White Paper reports that Roma were characterized as needing to be 'rescued from their inferior way of life and be brought within the framework of social care.' Another major justification for discriminatory practices was the widespread belief that Roma's situation is 'self-inflicted' or 'self-chosen.' Roma's 'nomadic way of life' provided an additional rationale for the refusal to include Roma in the national census, while their 'poor circumstances, meagre housing conditions' and children being taken into care, justified sterilization ... The White Paper concludes that Roma in Sweden in the 20th century and still currently, remain 'subjected to anti-Gypsyism.'&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|10}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Stockholm]], Romani settlement was discouraged by authorities during the 1940s when increased numbers of Romani persons began to arrive, by denying access to water and electricity.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|11}} In the 1950s, a pilot social program was initiated in Stockholm to provide Romani families with housing; however, the poor quality of the housing, exacerbated by a lack of hot water and central heating for 22 out of the sixty families involved, resulted in the program being "deemed a failure".&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|11}} In [[Gothenburg]], similar issues have been documented, with interview testimony from Romani resident Sonya Taikon detailing how homeless Romani people in the 1960s had to live without electricity or sanitation, deriving their water "from a stream in the middle of Gothenburg".&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|11}}Davis and Ryan argue that these issues are policy-oriented in nature, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;water and sanitation access are central components of discrimination against Roma over the decades. As travelers in the early decades of the twentieth century seeking work, Roma communities necessarily looked for camping places where water and sanitation would be available. And when Swedish municipalities sought to deter Roma groups from settling, controlling their access to water and sanitation is often a means to that end.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|10–1}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contrary to stereotypes that portray Romani marginalization as "self-chosen", historical documentation exists of Swedish Romani individuals describing their close affinity with water resources, and of their efforts to gain access to water resources.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|10–1}} As described through an oral account from an ethnographic study, one Romani woman

&lt;blockquote&gt;recalled that in the 1920's, when the family was able to stay long enough in one place, her mechanically-minded father had the know-how to build devices for daily hygiene and washing of clothes. At one point, her father built a square wash basin and toilet. He covered the floor with fir twigs, then cartons and finally rugs so the family would not get cold feet. 'It was so exciting, you never forget,' the woman remembered.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same study, Romani persons interviewed "described the efforts they made to ensure that they did not disturb Swedish residents so that they could continue to access water. One interviewee recalled that her mother bound the dogs' muzzles to keep them from barking and jeopardizing their permission to obtain water from a local farm."&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|11}}

Between January 2013 and January 2016, "83 evictions of groups of vulnerable EU citizens holding a right of residence in Romania or Bulgaria" took place.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|14}} Of the applications for these evictions, "an overwhelming number cite the prevalence of, or risk for, sanitation hazards and littering as grounds for eviction"&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|16}} and are understood within a context of environmental impact concern&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|16}} in which the lack of access to water is cited as a central issue.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|5}} Locations of evictions where water and sanitation access has been cited as reason for eviction have been tracked through an interactive mapping database developed in collaboration between [[Södertörn University|Södertörn]] and [[Northeastern University|Northeastern Universities]] respectively.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|3,5}} Most of these cases have occurred in the greater Stockholm and Gothenburg regions respectively, along with cases in [[Uddevalla]], [[Malmö]], [[Skara]], [[Karlstad]], and [[Uppsala]].&lt;ref name="nulawromasve"&gt;Sievert, Jules and Jackson, Dan.

One notable example of water exclusion can be found in northern regions of Sweden, where Romani EU citizens from Eastern Europe come to work as farm laborers in the berry harvesting industry.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|11–2}} In one case, living out of informal camps, these workers have described having to travel distances up to 60 kilometres (round trip) to acquire water; using water from gas stations; and constructing makeshift latrines.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|12}} Conflicts with local residents surrounding water use were alleviated as a result of the local municipality installing water cisterns for the farm workers.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|12}}

In many cases, the risk or threat of significant environmental impact is invoked as a reason for eviction, even when very small numbers of individuals are involved and the actual environmental impact may arguably be minimal.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|16}} In the words of Davis and Ryan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;sanitation hazards are viewed as equally severe regardless of the number of identified respondents to whom the eviction decision is directed, whether it be two or several dozen ... Twenty five of the eviction decisions were directed at six respondents or fewer and had existed anywhere from ten days up to three months. Despite these settlements being significantly smaller than many of the others and not having existed very long, "extensive inconveniences" in terms of sanitation costs were still cited in each decision. This was the case in a 2013 decision in Stockholm, where the municipality held that "the area around the settlement is subjected to great environmental impacts ... The decision only concerned two respondents".&lt;ref name="wallenbergromasve" /&gt;{{rp|16}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Alongside a similar case from Gothenburg in 2014, Davis and Ryan further highlight a case in Stockholm from 2015 where two persons were legally deemed by the Stockholm Land and Premises Maintenance Office to carry the same burden of environmental impact as the settlement they took up residence, which already had 49 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="wallenbergromasve" /&gt;{{rp|16}} Cases have also been recorded where assumptions of environmental damage and pollution were made, even though evidence to suggest otherwise was documented.&lt;ref name="wallenbergromasve" /&gt;{{rp|17}}

Private businesses and individuals, who often provide water and sanitation services out of goodwill, often bear a disproportionate burden of pressures caused by these issues.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|13–4}} In the opinion of Davis and Ryan, denial of water access to certain individuals can arguably impact the rights of all members of a community:

&lt;blockquote&gt;without access to on-site or nearby sanitation, and without local government support in accessing these necessities the informal camps where vulnerable EU citizens often reside can soon raise legitimate public health and environmental concerns, impinging on the rights of all in the community, creating a crisis for the municipality and incurring even greater city expenses in evictions and site clean-ups.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|29}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite Sweden’s multiple legal commitments to international and domestic human rights,&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|21–2}} issues of environmental inequality, in the form of water, sanitation, and electricity access, arguably persist as a continuation of historical patterns of inequality affecting its Romani minority.&lt;ref name=wallenbergromasve/&gt;{{rp|5, 10–1}} These issues exist in modern-day parallel with Swedish practices of racism and environmental marginalization toward the Sami Indigenous people and their territories.&lt;ref name=Sametinget&gt;{{cite web|author=Sametinget (Swedish Sami Parliament)|title=Minerals and Mines in Sápmi: The Viewpoint of the Swedish Sami Parliament|work=Appendix 2, Preparatory Report from the Sami Parliament in Sweden/Sámediggi/Sámedigge/Saemiedigkie/Sametinget for the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Ms. Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, prior to her 2015 August visit to Sápmi and Sweden|publisher=Sami Parliament in Sweden/ Sámediggi/Sámedigge/Saemiedigkie/Sametinget|year=2014|pages=2–14|accessdate=July 10, 2016|url=https://www.sametinget.se/87915|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006040720/https://www.sametinget.se/87915|archivedate=October 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="Bowers"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bowers, India Reed|type=Report|title=Preparatory Report from the Sami Parliament in Sweden/Sámediggi/Sámedigge/Saemiedigkie/Sametinget for the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Ms. Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, prior to her 2015 August visit to Sápmi and Sweden|publisher=Sami Parliament in Sweden/ Sámediggi/Sámedigge/Saemiedigkie/Sametinget|date=August 2015|pages=1–36|accessdate=July 10, 2016|url=https://www.sametinget.se/92639|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006040710/https://www.sametinget.se/92639|archivedate=October 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}{{rp|18}}

=== 1970 Bayramiç forestry dispute ===

According to Rahmi Ozel, the former attorney of [[Bayramiç]], a series of violent attacks against the Romani community there took place between January 18 and February 22, 1970.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|114}} Part of a larger conflict surrounding access to forest resources,&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|57}} the attacks were triggered by a dispute over ownership of a [[logging truck]].&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|114}} While no one was killed in the attacks, the events caused significant terror among both Romani and non-Romani members of the community,&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|132}} and led to the expulsion of the Bayramiç Romani.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Social and behavioral sciences scholar Gül Ӧzateşler has argued that the attacks, whose timing closely correlated to important dates in the logging industry season&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|57}} reflected insecurities about ethnic Turkish loss of power to Romani persons, who were gaining socioeconomic influence due to their role in the transportation sector&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|169–170}} of the forestry industry.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|57, 157}}

In the 1960s, [[forestry]] became an increasingly profitable industry in Turkey, as lumber consumption rapidly increased.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|56}} Due to increased investment in forestry management and production, Turkey became recognized for its timber industry, to the extent that its supplies were viewed as competitive within a globalized international context.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|56}} In 1963–1964, new mountain roads near Bayramiç were created to enable timber extraction, coupled with improvements in highway networks.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|57}} On August 26, 1967, The Regional Administration of Forestry in Bayramiç city and the surrounding Bayramiç district was founded.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|56}} At the time, 53.8% of provincial territory was covered by timber stands.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|56}} As a result of these developments, employment in the forestry transportation sector increased from 30 individuals to 200 in Bayramiç during this time.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|57}}
[[File:Human Rights Mural.JPG|thumb|Mural describing human rights in Turkey, 2009. Exterior of public education building, Bayramiç]]
In Bayramiç, conflicts over the processing, handling, and transport of timber were commonplace among locals.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|57}} According to Ӧzateşler, "The competition was especially acute, as at that time forestry offered the best jobs for many villagers and townspeople. It is no coincidence that the attacks on the Gypsies started in January and stopped at the end of February, before the annual start date of the forestry business in the town, in the month of March."&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|57}}

Few cars existed in the Bayramiç region during the 1950s and 1960s; for example, there were only five jeeps in the town during the late 1950s, and animals were used as primary means for transportation.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|157}} During the late 1950s, timber was the primary economic product exported from the town,&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|157}} and by 1960, there were eight logging trucks stationed in the city.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|157}} Romani people became involved in logging truck driving beginning in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|157}} According to Ӧzateşler, Romani people "became powerful in a prestigious position" by becoming logging truck drivers.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|157}} According to one truck driver from the era, the driving profession was viewed as having higher prestige than a state official.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|158}} Ӧzateşler states "it was not easy to find a good driver; experienced drivers therefore had a very strong bargaining position, including a high social status. They were said to be more prestigious even than their own bosses. They were treated as kings in the coffeehouses. When they came in, people would stand up and greet them."&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|158}} However, the reason for the success of Romani truck drivers was their willingness to work an extremely dangerous job.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|157}} In the words of Ӧzateşler, "They were just doing the dirty job at that time; as it was very tiring and dangerous due to lack of proper roads to the mountain ... one was supposed to be a little mad to be a driver as the risks were considerable."&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|157}}

In 1970, a [[Leyland Trucks|Leyland]] truck was purchased by a Romani family in partnership with an ethnic Turkish driver (who later helped start the attacks), and became subject of great interest.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|160}} As a symbol of wealth, it also became a source of resentment toward the socio-economic success of the Romani community.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|160}} According to Ӧzateşler, "All of the Gypsies mentioned the lorry as the object that triggered the attacks."&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|161}} One of the individuals responsible for orchestrating the attacks, Huseyin Kiltas, stated "What it came down to was the Leyland [logging truck]."&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|161}}

Following allegations against Romani truck drivers of sexual harassment toward non-Romani Turkish high school girls,&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|126–127}} a series of violent attacks took place against the Romani community of Bayramiç.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|162}} The first attack targeted the muhacir sub-group of Romani, who were engaged in the logging truck driving industry.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|3}} 38 houses were damaged.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|114}} This attack then grew into a second assault against all Romani persons in the area, involving 3,000 individuals who stoned Romani houses&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|3}}  and beat Romani residents.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|162}} The crowd marched on the municipal building, which was located on the main avenue leading to the "neighbourhoods where the Gypsies lived".&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|114}} When the city's attorney attempted to stop the crowd,&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|140}} he was nearly beaten to death by a gang of 30–40 individuals.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|114}} The Romani were subsequently forced to leave the city.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Many Romani went into hiding, while individuals who employed Romani experienced threats.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|133}} Some employers chose to risk their own safety and social status by protecting Romani people from the violence.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|140}} Verbal threats of sexual assault were directed towards Romani women.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|132–133}} According to Ӧzateşler&lt;blockquote&gt;In cases of conflicts and war, the female body is often treated as an arena for masculine honor and prestige along with nationalistic territorial claims ... Gypsies making passes at Turkish girls was seen as a violation of the national border and the territory of Turkish men ... female agency was entirely lacking in this scenario. The actual attackers were men and the supposedly abused women remained anonymous; nobody knew anything about them not even whether they really existed or not.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|169–170}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;From the perspective of Rana Kocayar, the oldest daughter of the Romani family that had purchased the logging truck, and Bidon Hilmi, a Romani truck driver at the time who was beaten during the violence, the allegations of sexual harassment were a means to cover the primary motives of the attacks, which were an attempt to prevent Romani people from participating in the forestry sector.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|161}} The violence ended on February 22, 1970 when word spread that one of the key perpetrators, a logging truck driver named Halit Er, was in critical medical condition.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|114}} His injuries had been caused during an altercation with Romani in [[Çanakkale]], who attacked him due to his role provoking the Bayramiç attacks.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|114}} Some Romani returned to Bayramiç in the following months and years, while others did not.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|113}} To date, no one has been prosecuted for inciting or taking part in the violence.&lt;ref name="Ӧzateşler"/&gt;{{rp|174}}

=== Effects on Indigenous groups in Russia ===
Throughout [[Russia]], mostly in [[Siberia]] but also west of the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]] in [[European Russia]], there has been significant industrial development and pollution on Indigenous lands.&lt;ref name="Donhahoe"&gt;Donhahoe, Brian.

Forcible [[Tsarist bureaucracy|Tsarist]] jurisdiction over Khanty, Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets territory began in the sixteenth century."&lt;ref name="Espiritu, Aileen 1997"/&gt;{{rp|44}} Espiritu expands on the social implications of historical dispossession, writing
&lt;blockquote&gt;Throughout the eighteenth century, the exaction of exceedingly high ''[[yasak]]'' [tribute in furs] payments forced the Yamalo-Nenets and the Khanty to abandon their traditional economy of hunting and fishing in order to trap sables, and later foxes, for Russian officials and traders. The Khanty, Mansi, and Yamalo-Nenets were, therefore, forced to leave their own territories in an attempt to live as they had lived for hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of years (Prokof'yeva, et al. 1956:515) ... These effects on the Khanty, Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets, while serious, were minimal when compared to the imposition of Soviet rule and hegemony.&lt;ref name="Espiritu, Aileen 1997" /&gt;{{rp|44}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] policies from 1917 onwards quickly focused on the transition of Indigenous economies from traditional livelihoods into socialist economies based upon, in the words of anthropologist Debra Schindler, "the creation of a 'modern,'... urban-industrial settlement system; collectivization of the indigenous production economy; development of natural resources and the industrial development of other branches of the economy; and the introduction of the indigenous population to and their incorporation in 'modern' (Russian) society (1991:70)."&lt;ref name="Espiritu, Aileen 1997" /&gt;{{rp|44–5}} According to Espiritu, the result of these state policies "based on rigid and dogmatic [[Leninism|Leninist ideology]]" has led to severe damage for the cultural traditions, identities, and indigenous lifestyles of aboriginal Russian peoples.&lt;ref name="Espiritu, Aileen 1997" /&gt;{{rp|45}} In the opinion of geography scholar Gail A. Fondahl, [[File:Yamburg, Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug. Entry, 1986.jpg|thumb|Soviet oil development, Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, 1986]]&lt;blockquote&gt;Upon assuming power, the Soviet state identified the peoples of the North as exceedingly primitive, and in need of a special policy body to facilitate the transition to socialism (Sergeev 1995; Slezkine 1994). At the same time the Bolsheviks fingered the North as a storehouse of wealth to be exploited for the development of the new socialist state. In the first decade of Soviet power, planners deliberated on balancing aboriginal needs and state aspirations in debates regarding northern development policy, but by the mid-1930s the latter took clear precedence over the former. When development concerns dictated, the state confiscated aboriginal lands and relocated Natives.&lt;ref name="Fondahl"&gt;Fondahl, Gail A. "Environmental Degradation and Indigenous Land Claims in Russia's North." ''Contested Arctic: Indigenous Peoples, Industrial States, and the Circumpolar Environment''. Ed. McCarter, Joan and Smith, Eric Alden. Seattle and London: University of Washington Press, 1997. Print. {{ISBN|9780295997421}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|69}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;The drive for increased resource extraction intensified under [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime, resulting in particularly deleterious patterns of dispossession for Indigenous peoples in the European North, Siberia, and the [[Russian Far East|Far East]].&lt;ref name="ZumBrunnen, Craig 1997" /&gt;{{rp|89}} In the opinion of ZumBrunnen, &lt;blockquote&gt;Since the inception of Stalin's [[Stalinism|forced industrialization]] campaigns in the 1930s, these extensive, remote, resource-rich regions have been targeted for industrial development, mineral and energy resource extraction and processing which have had particularly disruptive and contaminating effects ... not only did Soviet development plans favor industrialization over traditional forms of economic activities, but all too often these industrial developments have been in conflict with traditional indigenous economic activities, such as reindeer herding, fishing, fur harvesting, and self-sufficient forms of agriculture, domestic animal husbandry, and logging, all of which require healthy ecosystems."&lt;ref name="ZumBrunnen, Craig 1997" /&gt;{{rp|89}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Nenets reindeer sledge.jpg|thumb|Nenet people with reindeer]] Many of these issues of environmental degradation and indigenous dispossession have arguably continued from Soviet times into the present day.&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|21}} As described by one observer in 1991, "In the majority of regions inhabited by [the numerically [[Indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East|Small Peoples of the North]]] the ecological situation has sharply intensified, the systematic destruction of established norms and rules of natural resource use has been allowed (O dopolnitel'nykh 1991)."&lt;ref name="Fondahl" /&gt;{{rp|76}}
For Indigenous peoples in Russia, environmental degradation can often affect deeper cultural and metaphysical sentiments beyond ecological and economic concerns, extending to all aspects of indigenous lifestyles and epistemologies.&lt;ref name="Fondahl" /&gt;{{rp|68}} As argued by Fondahl, "Northern peoples differed from other citizens of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] due to their involvement in activities that required an intimate connection with, and an extensive use of, expansive homelands. If symbolic of primitivism in the eyes of many Soviet citizens, the traditional activities also symbolized a special, harmonic and intense interaction with the natural environments.&lt;ref name="Fondahl" /&gt;{{rp|73}}

For example, when Soviet planners attempted to "rationalize", collectivize, and commercialize traditional Indigenous livelihoods such as reindeer husbandry, their efforts were frustrated by the realization that indigenous peoples worldviews treated such economies as intrinsically tied to non-economically quantifiable values of social and spiritual significance, which ran contrary to Soviet modernization rationale.&lt;ref name="Fondahl" /&gt;{{rp|73}} Reindeer "conveyed a family's protective spirits, provided not only physical but spiritual nourishment at life-event celebrations, and accompanied the owner on her or his voyage from this world to the next".&lt;ref name="Fondahl" /&gt;{{rp|73}} These metaphysical Indigenous values were rooted in the working indigenous vocabulary of reindeer husbandry to such an extent that Soviet workers assigned to the field with Indigenous groups frequently had little choice but to learn the Indigenous languages as no corollary terms for these expressions existed in Russian, yet were vital to learning the trade.&lt;ref name="Fondahl" /&gt;{{rp|73}}

The effect of industry on the well-being of reindeer herding has been a profound concern to many Indigenous people in Russia. Speaking at the Second International Working Seminar on the Problems of Northern Peoples ([[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]], [[British Columbia|BC]], [[Canada]], 1996), V.A. Robbek, Director, Institute of the Problems of Northern Minorities, [[Yakutsk]], [[Sakha Republic]] ([[Yakutia]]),&lt;ref name="Fondahl" /&gt;{{rp|83}} stated, "Destroy our reindeer breeding and our traditional lands and you destroy us, the [[Evens|Even]], as a people."&lt;ref name="Fondahl" /&gt;{{rp|73}}

Similar views were expressed by another Russian Indigenous commentator in 1996, who stated&lt;blockquote&gt;Our Native lands are being annexed and barbarically destroyed by rapacious petroleum and natural gas, coal, gold, and non-ferrous mining interests without any form of just compensation...and this phenomena {{sic}} is depriving us of our lands and rights to part of the resource wealth, [and] deprives us of our basic right—a right to life (Social...1996).&lt;ref name="Fondahl" /&gt;{{rp|74}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Our rivers, lakes and swamps are being mercilessly polluted. Our ancestral land is being destroyed. We are deprived of the natural resources which are our main source of livelihood. Our constitutional rights to a healthy living environment, to clean air and clean water is being violated systematically. Oil companies, and first of all LUKOIL-Komi, the main operator of oil production within Komi Republic, are brushing off our letters and appeals with dismissals, promises and deceit. Neither have we never received an adequate and constructive response to our repeated enquiries to various authorities, from the municipal district administration to the country's leadership.

December 21, 2006. n. pag. Web. May 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest single displacement took place when Sami fishermen were evacuated from the coastline in order to make way for secretive naval installations.&lt;ref name="Madslien, Jorn 2006" /&gt; Meanwhile, reindeer herders were dispossessed from their territories along a 200-mile zone adjacent to the border with Finland and Norway.&lt;ref name="Madslien, Jorn 2006" /&gt; This border was soon closed, effectively shutting communication and movement between Sami peoples in Finland, Norway, and Sweden with those on the Russian Kola.&lt;ref name="Madslien, Jorn 2006" /&gt;
[[File:Панорама 2009 г. - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Lovozero, where many Sami displaced from their traditional territories have been resettled]]
Further displacement was caused by the arrival of increased heavy industry and natural resource extraction such as forestry and mining during Soviet times.&lt;ref name="Madslien, Jorn 2006" /&gt; Hundreds of thousands of workers from other areas of the USSR arrived, many of whom were forcibly interned as workers in the [[Gulag]]s.&lt;ref name="Madslien, Jorn 2006" /&gt; This industrialization disrupted reindeer herding livelihoods, and led in part to the settlement of Sami into Soviet-designed urban areas such as [[Lovozero (rural locality)|Lovozero]].&lt;ref name="Madslien, Jorn 2006" /&gt; Today, most Russian Sami live in extreme poverty and poor housing conditions.&lt;ref name="Madslien, Jorn 2006" /&gt;[[File:Панорама Никеля 2.jpg|thumb|City of Nikel, Kola Peninsula, on traditional Sami indigenous territories.

=== Western Siberia (Khanty-Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug) ===
By 2008, more than 70 billion barrels of oil had been extracted from the [[Western Siberia]]n province of [[Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug|Khanty-Mansi]].&lt;ref name="Starobin, Paul 2008" /&gt; Representing 70 percent of Russian oil production at a 2008 rate of seven million barrels a day,&lt;ref name="Starobin, Paul 2008" /&gt; vast quantities of energy resources from Khanty-Mansi are destined for Western Europe annually.&lt;ref name="Henderson, James 2015"/&gt;{{rp|29,37}} According to journalist Paul Starobin, the region's Indigenous inhabitants have experienced ongoing social and economic marginalisation, in spite of the economic wealth generated by oil and gas development.

&lt;blockquote&gt;When Siberia's oil lands came under development, native people were forcibly herded into villages and cut off from their hunting and fishing grounds. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, the nomads won legal status as "aboriginal people," with the right to roam the oil fields. In spite of their new status ... their lot has hardly improved. Their numbers are small, about 30,000 in all; their languages are nearly extinct; and they are heavily afflicted by the scourges of contemporary Russia—[[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], [[alcoholism]], and [[tuberculosis]]. Some oil-tax money is being invested in medical ships that stop along the rivers to care for patients. But critics say these floating clinics diagnose disease, then leave patients with no means to get treatment.&lt;ref name="Starobin, Paul 2008" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;By the early 1970s, oil and gas reserves began to deplete in northeastern Russia, and production started to shift towards Western Siberia.&lt;ref name="Espiritu, Aileen 1997" /&gt;{{rp|49}} Yet by the late 1980s, it was becoming increasingly visible that much of the wealth generated by oil and gas development was not reaching Indigenous groups. According to Espiritu, by this time the living conditions of many Indigenous people in Siberia was in a precipitous state, and Yamalo-Nenet groups were documented as living in "squalid" conditions within close proximity to the city of [[Salekhard]].&lt;ref name="Espiritu, Aileen 1997" /&gt;{{rp|54}}
As part of the rapid ramping up of production of oil and gas during the 1960s and 1970s, proper infrastructure for both the handling of petroleum products, as well as social infrastructure for the influx of workers, was frequently overlooked.&lt;ref name="Espiritu, Aileen 1997" /&gt;{{rp|48}} Thousands of kilometres of pipelines were built using substandard construction codes for the harsh climate, resulting in vast numbers of leaks and spills.&lt;ref name="Espiritu, Aileen 1997" /&gt;{{rp|48}} According to a 1997 essay by ZumBrunnen, environmentalists at the time estimated that 35,000 pipeline ruptures were occurring each year, accounting for between one and three percent of Russian oil output (3 to 10 million metric tons annually).&lt;ref name="ZumBrunnen, Craig 1997" /&gt;{{rp|107}} Meanwhile, 19 billion cubic meters of gas were being flared in West Siberia annually, releasing [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|polyaromatic hydrocarbons]], [[Toxic heavy metal|heavy metals]], [[carbon]], and [[nitrogen dioxide]]s into the local atmosphere.&lt;ref name="ZumBrunnen, Craig 1997" /&gt;{{rp|107}} In 2012, the figure was estimated at 17.1 billion cubic metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=Haugland, Torleif|url=http://www.ebrd.com/downloads/sector/sei/ap-gas-flaring-study-final-report.pdf|title=Associated Petroleum Gas Flaring Study for Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan|work=Carbon Limits|publisher=European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|date=November 2013|accessdate=May 22, 2016|p=13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006041353/http://www.ebrd.com/downloads/sector/sei/ap-gas-flaring-study-final-report.pdf|archivedate=October 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to pollution from the oil and gas developments, reindeer herding, fishing, and hunting became unviable for many Yamalo-Nenets in the area, and many had little choice but to request government assistance.&lt;ref name="Espiritu, Aileen 1997" /&gt;{{rp|54}} Since the 1980s, fluctuations in energy production in Khanty-Mansi and Yamalo-Nenetskiy Autonomous Okrugs have caused many Indigenous Khanty, Mansi, and Yamalo-Nenet peoples who were employed in the energy sector to find themselves out of work, with no viable traditional livelihoods to return to.&lt;ref name="Espiritu, Aileen 1997" /&gt;{{rp|55}}

It has been estimated (according to statistics given in an interview by Evgenia Belyakova, Arctic project coordinator for [[Greenpeace]] Russia) that the total cost of replacing Russia's ageing pipelines could cost 1.3 trillion Russian rubles (approximately 1.5 billion US dollars), but could be achieved within five years if companies were prepared to absorb a 25% drop in profits at 2015 energy prices.&lt;ref name="Gertcyk, Olga 2015" /&gt;

=== Land use agreements and Indigenous-rights legislation ===

According to Indigenous studies scholar Brian Donahoe, "Article 69 of the 1993 Russian Constitution explicitly guarantees in principle the 'rights of the indigenous small-numbered peoples in accordance with the universally recognized principles and norms of international law and international agreements that the Russian Federation has entered into."&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|24}}[[File:Petroleum drills Surgut Russia.jpg|thumb|Petroleum infrastructure near Surgut, Western Siberia, 2000.]]The "vague wording" of laws surrounding indigenous rights in Russia&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|26}} has resulted in Indigenous land use agreements in Russia that are often informal in nature.&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|27}} For example, "Dmitry Aleksandrovich Nesanelis, the former vice director of the [[Lukoil]]-Varandeyneftegaz oil drilling company (Lukoil's daughter company in the Nenets Autonomous Oblast), an anthropologist by training and the person responsible for relations between this company and the indigenous Nenets people, asserted in 2003 that it was in the interests of the state to make these laws so vague as to be unworkable."&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|27}}

Nesanelis has also spoken of concerns regarding the implications of vague legislation on oil drilling.&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|27}} According to Donahoe, "As a large multinational corporation, Lukoil is concerned with its public image with respect to the effect its activities have on indigenous peoples and on the environment." Nesanelis has stated he would prefer laws that would give energy corporations "some concrete guidelines about 'what exactly they have to pay, how, and to whom.'"&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|27}}

While some Indigenous leaders such as Vladislav Peskov, president of the Association of Indigenous Small-Numbered Peoples of the Nenets Autonomous Oblast have spoken in favour of informal agreements (Peskov has stated that "Different people need different things. Some need land, some need money, and the informal agreements with the drillers allow everyone to get what they really want"&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|21}}), others have voiced concerns about the long-term implications of informal land-use agreements. In the opinion of Donahoe, the informal nature of these agreements privilege short-term benefits over the security of long-term legal protections.&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|27}} In the words of Donahoe, "Having failed to assert their legal rights when they could have [after 2004, new Russian laws such as the omnibus Federal Law no. 122 have weakened indigenous legal rights, especially Federal Law no. 232 pertaining to changes in Environmental Impact Assessments&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|29–31}}], they will find in the longer term that their economically and politically more powerful partners can turn the law against them when it behooves them to do so."&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|27}}

Russia, an [[International Labour Organization|International Labor Organization]] member, has not ratified ILO 69, an agreement that "explicitly and unequivocally asserts the right to self-determination for all indigenous peoples".&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|28}} According to Donahoe, this allows the Russian Federation to "continue to deny Indigenous peoples true control over their economic resources".&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|28}} As articulated by Donahoe, [[File:Bovanenkovo gas 9.jpeg|thumb|Bovanenkovo gas field infrastructure, Yamal Peninsula]]&lt;blockquote&gt;Russia is also a member of the [[United Nations]] whose charter somewhat vaguely states that one of the purposes of the organization is 'to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples' (Article 1, paragraph 2) ... The United Nations recognizes indigenous peoples of classically colonized lands—namely, colonized lands that lie across an ocean from the colonizing country (the "salt water test"; see Magnarella 2001, 2002; Niezen 2003, 138)—but has carefully avoided recognizing indigenous minorities who are not separated from their colonizers by an ocean as 'peoples.' This lack of recognition implicitly denies such indigenous peoples the right to self-determination—one of the arguments Russia uses to justify not complying with UN treaties in the case of the indigenous peoples of Siberia.&lt;ref name=Donhahoe/&gt;{{rp|28}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Indigenous groups whose traditional territories lie in European Russia, such as the Nenets, Komi, and Sami peoples, are affected by this status of non-recognition of the right to self-determination, which, as federal policy&lt;ref name=Donhahoe/&gt;{{rp|28}} implicates all Indigenous groups in Russia in addition to Siberia.
Arguably, some of the implications of non-recognition of Indigenous title may be the existence of laws that allow for socio-environmental marginalization to take place. According to Donahoe, "The federal government's monopoly over the law can be best illustrated by the negotiations over the new Land Code (Zemel'nyi Kodeks; Federal Law no. 136 of October 25, 2001) and Forest Code (Lesnoi Kodeks; Federal Law no. 200 of December 4, 2006)" which have allowed for the privatization of timber supplies.&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|32}} Under new iterations of these laws, previously non-commercially exploitable "forest fund [lesnoi fond]" lands, which constitute approximately 70 percent of Russia's landmass, have arguably been opened up for private sale.&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|32}} These new laws arguably lack provisions for the recognition of Indigenous rights,&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|33}} resulting in a Forest Code that, in the opinion of Donahoe, "effectively removes the power of regional governments ([[Republics of Russia|republics]], [[Oblasts of Russia|oblasti]], [[Krais of Russia|kraia]], [[okrug]]i, etc.) to exert [non-federal] control over these lands".&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|33}}

The result has been a centralization of power over land management, which has arguably contributed to an unstable legal and economic context for the livelihoods of Indigenous hunters and reindeer herders who "operate in a virtually noncash economy and could not possibly afford to purchase or lease the extensive tracts of land necessary to migrate seasonally, which is crucial both to reindeer husbandry and to the effective exploitation of animal resources", according to Donahoe.&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|33}} The privatization of land has widened concerns over access rights, which could potentially have negative effects on Indigenous hunting and grazing.&lt;ref name="Donhahoe" /&gt;{{rp|33}}[[File:Komi Republic oil pollution, aging infrastructure.jpg|thumb|Komi Republic oil pollution, on traditional Izvata territories]]Indigenous groups in Russia have attempted to defend their rights in court. In the opinion of Donahoe, Indigenous groups in Russia have "demonstrated ingenuity in their attempts to assert their rights to land and resources and to protect against industrial development and extractive activities by using other laws not specifically designed for the protection of indigenous rights".&lt;ref name=Donhahoe/&gt;{{rp|35}} For example, Indigenous groups have established "national parks or specially protected nature territories (osobo okhranaemye prirodnye territorii) at the local or regional level or both", under their rights to do so as outlined in Federal Law no. 33 (March 14, 1995), "On Specially Protected Nature Territories [Ob osobo okhranaemykh prirodnykh territoriiakh]".&lt;ref name=Donhahoe/&gt;{{rp|35}}
In one case, the Native Assembly of the KMAO (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug) "asked" Andrew Wiget and Ol'ga Balalaeva to craft a law that would "protect the 'folklore' of the indigenous people of Khanty-Mansi more generally".&lt;ref name=Donhahoe/&gt;{{rp|37}} Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug is an important oil-and-gas-producing region,&lt;ref name="Espiritu, Aileen 1997"/&gt;{{rp|49}} responsible for the supply of large quantities of energy to Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Lloyd, Claira 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henderson, James 2015"/&gt;{{rp|29,32,37}} It is also an area that has seen significant degradation of Indigenous lands as a result of oil and gas development.&lt;ref name=Donhahoe/&gt;{{rp|21}}&lt;ref name="Espiritu, Aileen 1997"/&gt;{{rp|48–9}}&lt;ref name="Makliuk, Yuliya 2014"/&gt; According to Donahoe, &lt;blockquote&gt;The idea was that, by protecting folklore, they would also be protecting the environment within which the folklore was embedded. It was especially important that the law should 'link the perpetuation of living folklore traditions to specific communities and landscapes': Understood in its fullest sense, it means that sacred place myths cannot exist without sacred places, nor local legends without the sites to which they are attached. In short, folklore cannot meaningfully endure if separated from the specific enculturated environment that it inhabits. Because the power to deface that environment rests with the non-native, political majority, this is potentially urgent, because KMAO is today the center of Russia's petroleum industry, and in some areas almost 90% of the land surface is licensed for petroleum production (Wiget and Balalaeva 2004, 139-140).&lt;ref name=Donhahoe/&gt;{{rp|37}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;After losing "some of its most important provisions", KMAO Law no. 37-03, "On the Folklore of the Native Minority Peoples of the North Living on the Territory of Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug" was passed on May 30, 2003, and came into effect June 18, 2003, with its arguably most important provision intact: "Native Minority Peoples living on the territory of Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug are guaranteed, in the manner established by legislation:...(3) the preservation and protection of the places of the traditional circulation of folklore, and of the natural resources necessary for the perpetuation and development of folklore traditions" (KMAO Law no. 37-03, Chapter 2, article 5, paragraph 2.3).&lt;ref name=Donhahoe/&gt;{{rp|37–8}}

=== Romani settlements and migrant worker camps ===

==== Underlying causes in European Russia ====

[[Romani people|Romani]] in Russia are frequently subject to geographic marginalization due to [[xenophobia]]. In 2005, Romani settlements in [[Arkhangelsk]] and [[Kaliningrad]] became the target of xenophobic political campaigns, in which local politicians used elections platforms that argued for "'cleaning' their city of 'gypsies' as one of their major promises to be fulfilled after winning the elections ... these politicians openly accused the entire Romani population of earning a living from the drug trade".&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"&gt;Bernard, Antoine et al, eds. ''[https://fidh.org/IMG/pdf/Romrussie501angconj2008-2-1.pdf Forced Evictions and the Right to Housing of Roma in Russia]'', no. 501/2: July 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006061443/https://fidh.org/IMG/pdf/Romrussie501angconj2008-2-1.pdf |date=October 6, 2016}} Anti-Discrimination Centre Memorial &amp; International Federation for Human Rights. p. 1–44. Web. April 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Romani were then accused of constructing illegal dwellings.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt; In Kaliningrad, Romani houses were later violently evicted by force.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt;{{rp|17}} In Arkhangelsk, after obtaining legal permission to rent their parcels of land in Novy Posyolok, the Romani were then accused of not having permission to build houses; in 2006, the entire community was forced to leave the city "on a train provided for this purpose by the city administration, taking them to the Moscow region, into another illegal situation...but out of the city's political debates".&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44" /&gt;{{rp|20}}

According to Paris-based Russian human rights organization Anti-Discrimination Centre (ADC) Memorial,&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt;{{rp|44}} there is a "tendency that market considerations and contempt toward persons regarded as 'Gypsies' coalesce in the actions of municipalities carrying out urban renewal programs, in which the eviction of Roma from city centers—and public view—is an active component of public policy".&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

==== Inequality in access to energy resources ====

In [[Ivanovo Oblast|Ivanovo Province]], the Kolyanovo Romani settlement was located near the disused Ivanovo airport.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt;{{rp|5}} The residents had been evicted from [[Ivanovo]] city 15 years earlier.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt;{{rp|5}} Following plans to expand the airport, the community became threatened with eviction once again.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

Often Romani settlements are denied access to utilities such as natural gas,&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt;{{rp|5}} despite the abundance of natural gas in Russia.&lt;ref name="Henderson, James 2015"/&gt;{{rp|29}} For example, in [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan Province]], the village of Dyaguilevo, with a population of 600 persons, has been established since 1988 in "extreme poverty" and, as of 2008, has faced significant issues with obtaining reliable natural gas and electricity service.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

An arguably more extreme case of inequality over access to energy resources can be found in the Roma village of Plekhanovo, located five kilometres outside [[Tula, Russia|Tula]].&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt;{{rp|6}} As of 2008, the village was inhabited by 3000 individuals, most of whom had been settled there since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt;{{rp|6}} In March 2016, a violent confrontation took place between residents (including children) and as many as 500 riot police over access to a natural gas pipeline that runs through the village.&lt;ref name="Sparks, John 2016"&gt;Sparks, John. ''[http://news.sky.com/story/1661780/roma-clash-with-riot-police-over-access-to-gas Roma Clash With Riot Police Over Access to Gas]''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206233757/https://news.sky.com/story/roma-clash-with-riot-police-over-access-to-gas-10208544 |date=February 6, 2017}} Sky News. March 17, 2016. n. pag. Web. May 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the line running through the village, the Romani inhabitants, whose houses were at risk of demolition, had been unable to secure legal access rights to the gas, and had resorted to illegally tapping into the pipeline for domestic use.&lt;ref name="Sparks, John 2016"/&gt; According to community representative Nadezhda Demetr, "Instead of helping people register their houses and legalise their gas supplies, the authorities have been demolishing their houses. Since 2005, houses have been demolished without compensation because they don't have any documents."&lt;ref name="Sparks, John 2016"/&gt;  Another local Romani community leader, Ivan Grigoryevich, stated to media that "We have been living in this settlement since the 1960s and we have tried many, many times to get gas into our houses, but we are prohibited by town officials."&lt;ref name="Sparks, John 2016"/&gt;

==== Disputed environmental reasons for evicting Romani settlements ====

In another conflict related to land and natural resource issues, the village of Kosaya Gora (3 kilometres outside Tula) was, as of 2008, threatened with eviction.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt;{{rp|5}} The village of 400 individuals had been located at its current site since the 1960s, yet the land on which the Romani resided was declared by a court to be located on a "protected nature reserve area", according to Romani rights activists.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

In a similar case to Kosaya Gora, residents of a Romani settlement in [[Chudovo, Chudovsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Chudovo]] were faced with eviction in 2007.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt;{{rp|24}} The residents, who had resettled to the area with verbal consent from local authorities after being evacuated from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, had been living in the area since the mid-1990s, later to learn that their houses were declared as falling within a "sanitary protection zone" around an unused asphalt plant, and that their homes would be subject to demolition.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt; Without access to documents to demonstrate title to the land, the community could not effectively argue in protection of their claimed property rights.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Antoine 2008. p. 1–44"/&gt;

==== Migrant workers from Hungary and Central Asia ====

Migrant workers in Russia frequently experience issues of environmental marginalization as a result of social and economic pressure to live in high-risk, substandard accommodations. According to Anti-Discrimination Centre (ADC) Memorial,&lt;blockquote&gt;Migrant workers, especially families with children, often cannot find accommodation, due to high prices and the unwillingness of landlords to rent their property to migrants, particularly to those who do not have the appropriate documentation. As a result, migrant families are forced to live in places not designed for living, especially for living with children. Companies, who are happy to employ cheap migrant labor, and to save on their accommodation, are often facilitating this process.&lt;ref name="Kulaeva Stephania 2013. p. 1-47"&gt;Kulaeva Stephania &amp; Abramenko, Olga. ''[http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CRC/Shared%20Documents/RUS/INT_CRC_NGO_RUS_15814_E.pdf The Situation of Children Belonging to Vulnerable Groups in Russia: Alternative Report]'', March 2013. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731001808/http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CRC/Shared%20Documents/RUS/INT_CRC_NGO_RUS_15814_E.pdf |date=July 31, 2017}} Anti-Discrimination Centre Memorial. p. 1–47. Web. April 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of 2013, in the [[Nevsky District|Nevsky district]] of [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] migrant workers and their families have been documented living in unsafe housing conditions that lacked utilities such as safe drinking water and electricity.&lt;ref name="Kulaeva Stephania 2013. p. 1-47"/&gt;{{rp|34}} Many of the workers were from the former Soviet Republics of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref name="Kulaeva Stephania 2013. p. 1-47"/&gt;{{rp|34}} As of 2013, there was also a shantytown on the outskirts of St. Petersburg, segregated in a remote, difficult to access industrial area, whose residents were [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] citizens from Khorezm city.&lt;ref name="Kulaeva Stephania 2013. p. 1-47"/&gt;{{rp|35–6}} In addition to concerns over health and safety similar to those faced by migrant workers in Nevsky district, this settlement had no waste collection service, and contained large garbage pits.&lt;ref name="Kulaeva Stephania 2013. p. 1-47"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

Other areas of environmental concern have been the settlements of "Roma-Mugat" migrants from Tajikistan, such as the settlement at Volodarka village, St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name="Kulaeva Stephania 2013. p. 1-47"/&gt;{{rp|36}} As of 2013, according to ADC Memorial,&lt;blockquote&gt;The living conditions of Mugat-migrants do not correspond to elementary sanitary norms and requirements for security and hygiene. In Mugat settlements, which usually have several hundred inhabitants, there is no water supply, heating or electricity. Improvised settlements are spread on the boundaries of big towns, near household waste dumps, forest strips, [and] industrial areas ... where there is practically no infrastructure water supply, electricity and sewage system {{sic}}.&lt;ref name="Kulaeva Stephania 2013. p. 1-47"/&gt;{{rp|36}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of these "Central Asian Roma-migrants" have extremely poor diets, which are often supplemented by scavenged food from dumps.&lt;ref name="Kulaeva Stephania 2013. p. 1-47"/&gt;{{rp|36}} This has caused epidemic proportions of "tuberculosis, [[hepatitis]], intestinal disorders, and helminthiasis".&lt;ref name="Kulaeva Stephania 2013. p. 1-47"/&gt;{{rp|36}}

Romani migrants from [[Hungary]] often face visible issues of environmental marginalization in Russia.&lt;ref name="Kulaeva Stephania 2013. p. 1-47"/&gt;{{rp|36–7}} As of 2013, according to ADC Memorial, "One of the largest Roma-[[Magyarization|Magyar]] settlements is situated in the industrial area on the outskirts of Saint-Petersburg. It borders the [[Saint Petersburg – Moscow Railway|Saint-Petersburg-Moscow]] railway line and the household waste dump."&lt;ref name="Kulaeva Stephania 2013. p. 1-47"/&gt;{{rp|36}}  Within the camp, the houses were made of scavenged materials, and basic services and utilities such as water, sewerage, and garbage collection were nonexistent; for bathing, many residents used water from a nearby marsh.&lt;ref name="Kulaeva Stephania 2013. p. 1-47"/&gt;{{rp|36–7}} Due to substandard housing and the lack of water distribution, all residents lived in constant risk of fire hazards.&lt;ref name="Kulaeva Stephania 2013. p. 1-47"/&gt;

'''Erich Neumann''' ({{lang-he|אריך נוימן}}; 23 January 1905 – 5 November 1960),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.erelshalit.com/2014/07/gershom-scholem-obituary-for-erich.html|title=Erel Shalit: Gershom Scholem: Obituary for Erich Neumann|website=www.erelshalit.com|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[psychologist]], philosopher, writer, and student of [[Carl Jung]].

==Career==

Neumann was born in [[Berlin]] to a [[Jewish people|Jewish]] family.&lt;ref name="Paglia"&gt;http://www.bu.edu/arion/files/2010/03/Paglia-Great-Mother1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He received his PhD in Philosophy from the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]] in 1927 and then continued to study medicine at the [[University of Berlin]], where he acquired his first degree in medicine in 1933. In 1934 Neumann and his wife Julia, who had been [[Zionism|Zionists]] since they were teenagers, moved to [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref name="Paglia" /&gt; For many years, he regularly returned to [[Zürich]], Switzerland to give lectures at the [[C. G. Jung Institute]].  He also lectured frequently in England, France and the Netherlands, and was a member of the [[International Association for Analytical Psychology]] and president of the Israel Association of Analytical Psychologists. He practiced [[analytical psychology]] in [[Tel Aviv]] from 1934 until his death from [[kidney cancer]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="Paglia" /&gt;

==Contributions==

Neumann contributed to the field of [[developmental psychology]] and the psychology of [[consciousness]] and creativity.  He had a theoretical and philosophical approach to analysis, contrasting with the more clinical concern in England and the United States. His most valuable contribution to psychology was the empirical concept of "centroversion", a synthesis of extra- and introversion. However, he is best known for his theory of [[Femininity|feminine]] development, a theory formulated in numerous publications, most notably ''[[The Great Mother]]''. His works also elucidate the way [[mythology]] throughout history reveals aspects of the development of consciousness that are parallel in both the individual and society as a whole.

==Works==

His most enduring contributions to Jungian thought are ''[[The Origins and History of Consciousness]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Great Mother]]'' (1955).&lt;ref name="Hopcke"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hopcke, Robert H. |title=Jung, Jungians and Homosexuality |publisher=Shambhala Publications, Inc |location=Boston |year=1989 |page=70 |isbn=0-87773-585-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another work, ''Depth Psychology and a New Ethic'', reflects on human destructiveness and the way the human mind relates to its own shadow.

Neumann further developed his studies in feminine archetypes in his ''Art and the Creative Unconscious'', ''The Fear of the Feminine'', and ''Amor and Psyche''.

Neumann also wrote poetry, a novel called ''The Beginning'' (''Der Anfang''), and in 1932 conducted a critical study of [[Franz Kafka]]'s works at a time when Kafka was still a minor figure in the literary world.&lt;ref name="Paglia" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3131">Rev. Dr. '''Harvey J Sindima''' is a Malawian theologian, philosopher, professor and author. 
He has written extensively on matters of African philosophy, religious ethics and spirituality. He is the original voice behind the Malawian philosophy of personhood: "[[umunthu]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maravipost.com/scope/75-editor/4052-teaching-umunthu-for-peace-thoughts-on-intl-day-of-peace.html|title=The Maravi Post - 404 maravipost.com|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also works on independent charity project called Blantyre North Relief Project (BNRP) in [[Blantyre]], Malawi with his wife Gertrude Sindima.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bnrp.org/Sindima.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the BNRP, Harvey and Gertrude Sindima have built an independent university, Sindima Memorial Institute. It is a liberal arts university with a great emphasis in the fields of medicine, science, arts and technology. It is built solidly on the foundations of "umunthu." It was started with some logistical support from several long-term friends of the Sindimas, and these include Dr. Silas Ncozana, Dr. Augustine Musopole, and Dr. Harvey Kwiyani.

He received a CTS at the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian Theological College in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colgate.edu/academics/FacultyDirectory/Hsindima.html&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the CPS New College and University of Edinburgh  well. He received a Masters in divinity from the International Theological Center in 1982 and a PhD at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1988. He currently teaches at [[Colgate University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colgate.edu/academics/FacultyDirectory/Hsindima.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herman Philipse''' (born 13 May 1951) is a professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Utrecht University]] in the [[Netherlands]].  Philipse taught at [[Leiden University]] from 1986 until 2003 where he obtained his [[doctorate]] in 1983.

==Work==
Philipse has written many philosophical works in Dutch, including books on [[Husserl]]'s early philosophy of [[logic]], the role of certainty in [[Descartes]]' moral theory, and a widely read ''[[Atheïstisch manifest|Atheist Manifesto]]'' (1995, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2718341/1996/04/05/In-universitaire-oorlog-tussen-ongelovigen-en-theologen-mag-nu-alles.dhtml |title=In universitaire oorlog tussen ongelovigen en theologen mag nu alles |author= |publisher=Trouw |date=5 April 1996 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.polare.nl/boek/philipse-herman/atheistisch-manifest-de-onredelijkheid-van-religie-9789035126541/ |title=Atheistisch manifest &amp; De onredelijkheid van religie |author= |publisher=[[Polare]] |date= |accessdate=31 January 2014 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, he has written over a dozen articles in philosophical journals, as well as a detailed assessment of [[Heidegger]], ''Heidegger's Philosophy of Being: A Critical Interpretation''.  He has also written many commentaries for Dutch newspapers (most frequently as a regular contributor to the [[NRC Handelsblad]]) and current events television programs, defending [[atheism]] and advocating [[cultural assimilation]] for non-European immigrants in the Netherlands.

In his philosophical work, Philipse defends a non-[[Reductionism|reductionist]] [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], akin to that of [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[Peter Strawson]], and [[P.M.S. Hacker]].  While highly critical of the [[transcendental idealism|transcendental idealist]] tradition of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Husserl]] for its allegedly incoherent notion of conceptual schemes, Philipse argues that [[scientism|scientistic]] philosophies that attempt to reduce consciousness to purely physical descriptions (such as those of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] and [[Paul Churchland|Churchland]]) fall victim to a similar inconsistency: their theories logically depend on the concepts of ordinary human life they would abolish.  More generally, Philipse firmly defends the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]: support for the [[natural science]]s and [[political liberalism]].

In 2012 he published ''God in the Age of Science. A Critique of Religious Reason (''https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_the_Age_of_Science%3F).

From the late 1940s until the mid-1980s, he taught in the [[Classics|Department of Classics]] at [[Dalhousie University]] in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=James Alexander Doull|url=http://www.library.dal.ca/DUASC/Obituaries/DoullJA/|accessdate=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was himself educated at Dalhousie as well as at the [[University of Toronto]], [[Harvard University]], and the [[University of Oxford]], where he was a [[Rhodes Scholar]].

In 2003, the [[University of Toronto Press]] published a substantial volume containing a number of his works together with commentary provided by former colleagues and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Philosophy and Freedom: the Legacy of James Doull |url=http://www.utppublishing.com/Philosophy-and-Freedom-The-Legacy-of-James-Doull.html|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press|The University of Toronto Press]]|accessdate=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Philosophy and Freedom|url=https://www.mun.ca/2003report/research/publishing/peddle.php|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;{{cite journal |last=Diamond |first=Eli |title=Review of ''Philosophy and Freedom: The Legacy of James Doull'', edited by David G. Peddle and Neil G. Robertson |journal=[[Dialogue: Canadian Philosophical Review]] |date=Fall 2005 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=798–800 |doi=10.1017/S0012217300000159 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=5452180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duncan |first=John |title=''Philosophy and Freedom: The Legacy of James Doull'' (Review) |journal=[[University of Toronto Quarterly]] |date=Winter 2004–2005 |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=317–319 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/180541/pdf |doi=10.1353/utq.2005.0036}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of this compilation, which also contains biographical details upon which this article is largely based, is perhaps among the reasons that Doull is now rather better known than he was at any point during his life. It contains writings on Greek poetry; the culture of ancient Rome; ancient, medieval, and modern philosophy; and twentieth-century politics; and certain key figures (such as  [[Plato]], [[Augustine]], and [[Hegel]]) receive particular attention. In general the collection reflects Doull's deep conviction that the western philosophical tradition as a whole remains of great relevance and also his special interest in Hegel, with whose philosophical position Doull was in close agreement. Indeed, his Hegelian views (especially his judgement that Hegel had been successful in his attempt to articulate in the form of self-developing concepts the inner content of the Christian revelation) were no doubt a major reason that he was regarded as outside the philosophical mainstream.

He studied with [[Werner Jaeger]] at Harvard, and during the course of his life met a number of important figures ([[Etienne Gilson|Gilson]] for example) in twentieth-century philosophy; but he did not in general show much sign of having been formed philosophically by those he met, or indeed by anyone after Hegel. The Canadian philosopher [[Charles Norris Cochrane]], with whom he studied in Toronto, is perhaps the only notable exception to this.

He greatly admired the playing of the Canadian pianist [[Glenn Gould]], with whom he shared, in addition to an extraordinary independence of mind, a vision of Canadian spiritual life (which for Doull encompassed such spheres as politics, art, religion, and philosophy) that combined both a receptivity to the possibilities of the new world and a strong sense of continuity with the European past. [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] expressed surprise at having encountered a person of such comprehensive erudition in North America. [[Emil Fackenheim]] called him the only [[Hegelian]].&lt;ref name=Diamond/&gt; His colleague and friend [[George Grant (philosopher)|George Grant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Grant, George Parkin |first=H. D. |last=Forbes |volume=21 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/grant_george_parkin_21E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; said of him: 'Of all the Canadians of my generation, he certainly has the clearest intellect of any I have known. Nothing I would ever have to say about philosophy will compare to his knowledge of it'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christian|first=William|authorlink=William Christian (Canadian political scientist)|title=[[George Grant (philosopher)|George Grant: A Biography]]|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=1993|location=[[Toronto]]|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his published articles can be found in the journal [[Dionysius (journal)|Dionysius]], of which he was one of the founding Editors&lt;ref&gt;http://classics.dal.ca/Journals/Dionysius/&lt;/ref&gt; and in connection with which he was (together with his fellow Editors [[A. H. Armstrong]] and [[Robert Crouse|R. D. Crouse]]) remarkably successful in recruiting as Editorial Advisors many distinguished scholars, among whom were [[Werner Beierwaltes]], [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], [[Mary T. Clark]], [[Emil Fackenheim]], [[Eugene Fairweather]], [[J. N. Findlay]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[George Grant (philosopher)|George Grant]], [[Malcolm Ross (literary critic)|Malcolm Ross]], [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]], and [[George Huntston Williams|George Williams]]. He also published a number of essays in the electronic journal [[Animus (journal)|Animus]], the tenth Volume of which was devoted to essays on his life and thought.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.swgc.mun.ca/animus/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, he was admitted ''[[honoris causa]]'' to the degree of [[Doctor of Civil Law|''Doctor Civilis Legis'']] (DCL) of the [[University of King's College]] in Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;http://issuu.com/ukings/docs/tidings2001summer&lt;/ref&gt;

His papers have been deposited in the James Alexander Doull Archive at the [[Grenfell Campus, Memorial University of Newfoundland|Grenfell Campus of the Memorial University of Newfoundland]].

'''Jan Patočka''' (1 June 1907 – 13 March 1977) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] philosopher. Due to his contributions to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and the [[philosophy of history]] he is considered one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century. Having studied in [[Prague]], [[Paris]], [[Berlin]] and [[Freiburg]], he was one of the last pupils of [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]]. During his studies in Freiburg he was also tutored by [[Eugen Fink]], a relationship which eventually turned into a lifelong philosophical friendship.

==Early life==
Patočka attended [[Jan Neruda Grammar School]].

==Works==
His works mainly dealt with the problem of the original, given world (''Lebenswelt''), its structure and the human position in it. He tried to develop this [[Edmund Husserl|Husserlian]] concept under the influence of some core [[Martin Heidegger|Heideggerian]] themes (e.g. historicity, technicity, etc.)  On the other hand, he also criticised Heideggerian philosophy for not dealing sufficiently with the basic structures of [[Heideggerian terminology#Being-in-the-world|being-in-the-world]], which are not [[Heideggerian terminology#Aletheia|truth-revealing]] activities (this led him to an appreciation of the work of [[Hannah Arendt]]). From this standpoint he formulated his own original theory of "three movements of human existence": 1) ''receiving'', 2) ''reproduction'', 3) ''transcendence''. He also translated many of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]]'s works into Czech. In his life time, Patočka published in Czech, German, and French.

Apart from his writing on the problem of the ''Lebenswelt'', he wrote interpretations of [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Presocratic]] and [[Ancient Greek philosophy#Classical Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosophy]] and several longer essays on the history of Greek ideas in the formation of our concept of Europe. Patočka increasingly focused on the idea of Europe during the 1970s. As he was banned from teaching (see below), he held clandestine lectures in his private apartment on the Greek thought in general and on Plato in particular in the late 70s. These clandestine lectures are collectively known as ''Plato and Europe'', and they are published under the same title in English. He also entered into discussions about modern Czech philosophy, art, history and politics. He was an esteemed scholar of Czech thinkers such as [[John Amos Comenius|Komensky]] (b.1592) (also known as Comenius) and [[Masaryk]] (b.1850). In 1971, he has published a small treatise on Comenius in German titled ''Die Philosophy der Erziehung des J.A. Comenius (Comenius's Philosophy of Education).'' In 1977, his work on Masaryk culminated in 'Two Studies on Masaryk, which was initially a privately circulated typescript.&lt;ref&gt;Erazim Kohak, "Jan Patočka: A Philosophical Biography" in (ed.) Erazim Kohak, ''Jan Patočka: Philosophy and Selected Writings'' (Chicago &amp; London: The University of Chicago Press, 1989), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patočka's ''Heretical Essays in the Philosophy of History'' is analyzed at length and with much care in [[Jacques Derrida]]'s important book ''The Gift of Death.'' Derrida was the most recent person who wrote or conversed with Patočka's thought; [[Paul Ricoeur]] and [[Roman Jakobson]] (who respectively wrote the preface and afterword to the French edition of the ''Heretical Essays'') are two further examples.

During the years 1939–1945, when the Czech universities were closed, as well as between 1951–1968 and from 1972 on, Patočka was banned from teaching. Only a few of his books were published and most of his work circulated only in the form of typescripts kept by students and disseminated mostly after his death. Along with other banned intellectuals he gave lectures at the so-called "Underground University", which was an informal institution that tried to offer a free, uncensored cultural education. In January 1977 he became one of the original signatories and main spokespersons for the [[Charter 77]] (Charta 77) human rights movement in Czechoslovakia. For the three months after the Charter was released he was intensely active writing and speaking about the meaning of the Charter, in spite of his deteriorating health. He was also interrogated by the police regarding his involvement with the Charter movement, and on March 3, 1977 he was held by the police for ten hours, who had claimed that he would be allowed to speak in his role as a Charter spokesperson with a high-ranking official (in fact, this was a pretext to keep him from attending a reception at the West German embassy&lt;ref&gt;John Bolton, ''Worlds of Dissent ''(Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2012), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;). He fell ill that evening and was taken to the hospital, where his health briefly improved, enabling him to give one final interview with ''Die Zeit ''and to write one final essay entitled "What We Can Expect from Charter 77." On March 11 he relapsed, and on March 13 he died of [[apoplexy]], at the age of 69.

His brother [[František Patočka]] was a microbiologist.

'''Josephus Flavius Cook''' (1838–1901), commonly known as '''Joseph Cook''', was an American philosophical lecturer, clergyman, and writer. A descendant of Pilgrims, Cook started his ascent to fame by way of Monday noon prayer meetings in [[Tremont Temple]] in [[Boston]] that for more than twenty years were among the city's greatest attractions. In the lectures, Cook attempted to convey recent developments in European science and philosophy in a way that reconciled them to Protestant belief; his commentary stressed social amelioration and civic responsibility. He later travelled the world; his lectures were published and translated into several languages.

Cook was noted for his adversity to [[Christian Science]], which drew a response from [[Mary Baker Eddy]], who wrote a pamphlet, later expanded into the book ''[[No and Yes]]'' which opposed Cook's views on the subject. Eddy also spoke at one of Cook's Tremont Temple lectures in defence of Christian Science.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/research/historical-background-no-and-yes/&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Ticonderoga, New York]], he attended [[Phillips Academy]], and then entered [[Yale College]], later transferring to [[Harvard College]], from which he graduated in 1865.&lt;ref name="Remplap"&gt;L.T. Remplap, ed., ''The Gospel Awakening'' (1885), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kundun''''' is a 1997 [[Epic film|epic]] [[biographical film]] written by [[Melissa Mathison]] and directed by [[Martin Scorsese]]. It is based on the life and writings of [[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama]], the exiled political and spiritual leader of [[Tibet]]. Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong, a grandnephew of the Dalai Lama, stars as the adult Dalai Lama, while Tencho Gyalpo, a niece of the Dalai Lama, appears as the Dalai Lama's mother.

The film according to [[Roger Ebert]] was "made of episodes, not a plot" and he gave the film three stars out of four. [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "emotionally remote" but praised its look and its musical score. [[Richard Corliss]] praised the cinematography and score as well. [[Barry Norman]], chief film critic at the [[BBC]] opined that ''Kundun'' was both beautifully and intelligently made.

"Kundun" (སྐུ་མདུན་ {{bo|w=sku mdun}} in [[Tibetan script|Tibetan]]), meaning "presence", is a title by which the [[Dalai Lama]] is addressed. ''Kundun'' was released only a few months after ''[[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven Years in Tibet]]'', sharing the latter's location and its depiction of the Dalai Lama at several stages of his youth, though ''Kundun'' covers a period three times longer.

==Plot==

[[File:Kundun3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|At the beginning of the film the two-year-old boy (Tenzin Yeshi Paichang) is visited at his rural birthplace in Amdo by the searching [[lama]]s and undertakes a test to confirm his identity as the "Bodhisattva".]]
The film has a linear chronology with events spanning from 1937 to 1959;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9C06E2D8123EF937A15751C1A961958260 December 24, 1997 Review] from ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; the setting is [[Tibet]], except for brief sequences in China and India. It begins with the search for the 14th [[mindstream]] [[tulpa|emanation]] of the [[Dalai Lama]]. After a [[vision (religion)|vision]] by [[Reting Rinpoche]] (the [[regent]] of Tibet) several lamas disguised as servants discover a promising candidate: a child born to a farming family in the province of [[Amdo]], near the Chinese border.

These and other [[lama]]s administer a test to the child in which he must select from various objects the ones that belonged to the previous Dalai Lama. The child passes the test, and he and his family are brought to [[Potala Palace]] in [[Lhasa]], where he will be installed as Dalai Lama when he [[Coming of age|comes of age]].

During the journey, the child becomes homesick and frightened, but is comforted by Reting, who tells him the story of the first Dalai Lama–whom the lamas called "Kundun". As the film progresses, the boy matures in both age and learning. After a brief power struggle in which Reting is imprisoned and dies, the Dalai Lama begins taking a more active role in governance and religious leadership.

Meanwhile, the [[Chinese communists]], recently victorious in their revolution, are proclaiming Tibet a traditional part of [[History of China#Imperial era|Imperial China]] and express their desire to reincorporate it with the newly formed People's Republic of China. Eventually, despite Tibet's pleas to the United Nations, the United States, the United Kingdom, and India for intervention, Chinese Communist forces invade Tibet. The Chinese are initially helpful, but when the Tibetans resist Communist reorganization and reeducation of their society, the Chinese become oppressive.

Following a series of atrocities suffered by his people, the Dalai Lama resolves to meet with [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao Zedong]] in Beijing. While Mao publicly expresses his sympathies to the Tibetan people and the Dalai Lama, and insists that changes must be made as the Dalai Lama sees fit, relations inevitably deteriorate. During their face-to-face meeting on the final day of the Dalai Lama's visit, Mao makes clear his socialist view that "religion is poison" and that the Tibetans are "poisoned and inferior" because of it.

Upon his return to Tibet, the Dalai Lama learns of more horrors perpetrated against his people, who have by now repudiated their [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet|treaty]] with China and begun [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla action]] against the Chinese. After the Chinese make clear their intention to kill him, the Dalai Lama is convinced by his family and his Lord Chamberlain to flee to India.

After consulting the [[Nechung Oracle]] about the proper escape route, the Dalai Lama and his staff put on disguises and slip out of Lhasa under cover of darkness. During an arduous journey, throughout which they are pursued by the Chinese, the Dalai Lama becomes very ill and experiences two personal visions, first that their trip to India will be propitious and that, similarly, their eventual return to Tibet will also be propitious. The group eventually makes it to a small mountain pass on the Indian border. As the Dalai Lama walks to the guard post, an Indian [[Border guard|guard]] approaches him, salutes, and inquires: "Are you the [[Gautama Buddha|Lord Buddha]]?" The Dalai Lama replies with the film's final line: "I think that I am a reflection, like the moon on water.  When you see me, and I try to be a good man, you see yourself." Once the Dalai Lama arrives at his new residence, he unpacks his telescope and steps outside. Erecting it and removing his spectacles, he gazes through it toward the Himalayas–and toward Tibet. The film concludes with two lines printed on screen: "The Dalai Lama has not yet returned to Tibet. He hopes one day to make the journey." The words shimmer into a dissolve upon the black screen as the credits begin.

==Production==
The project began when screenwriter [[Melissa Mathison]], whose best-known work was ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|ET]]'', met with the Dalai Lama and asked him if she could write about his life.  According to [[Turner Classic Movies]], "he gave her his blessing and his time, sitting for interviews that became the basis of her script"; it was Mathison's suggestion that Scorsese be brought in as director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=338415&amp;category=Articles Overview of ''Kundun''] from the [[Turner Classic Movies]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
Even before the film was released, China's leaders hotly objected to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] plans to distribute the film, even to the point of threatening Disney's future access to China as a market.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985663,00.html Disney's China Policy] from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Disney's steadfastness stood in stark contrast to [[Universal Pictures]], which had earlier "turned down the chance to distribute ''Kundun'' for fear of upsetting the Chinese."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; Scorsese, Mathison, and several other members of the production were banned by the Chinese government from ever entering China as a result of making the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Change of direction for Scorsese|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/film/change-of-direction-for-scorsese|publisher=''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=37 Celebrities Banned From Foreign Countries|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/daves4/37-celebrities-banned-from-foreign-countries|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|access-date=September 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116180329/http://www.buzzfeed.com/daves4/37-celebrities-banned-from-foreign-countries|archive-date=November 16, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  China retaliated by banning Disney films and pulling Disney television cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barboza |first=David |last2=Barnes |first2=Brooks |date=June 14, 2016 |title=How China Won the Keys to Disney's Magic Kingdom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/business/international/china-disney.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=December 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Disney apologized in 1998 for releasing the film and began to "undo the damage", eventually leading to a deal to open [[Shanghai Disneyland Park|Shanghai Disneyland]] by 2016.&lt;ref name=THRJune&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brzeski|first1=Patrick|title=Shanghai Disney Resort Finally Opens After 5 Years of Construction and $5.5B Spent|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shanghai-disney-resort-finally-opens-897842|accessdate=June 9, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 8, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609051854/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shanghai-disney-resort-finally-opens-897842|archivedate=June 9, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The film did poorly at the box office, taking in less than $6&amp;nbsp;million in a limited U.S. distribution.&lt;ref name="thenum"/&gt; ''Kundun'' was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]]: for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] ([[Dante Ferretti]], art direction and [[Francesca Lo Schiavo]], set decoration), [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] ([[Roger Deakins]]), [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] ([[Philip Glass]]). The film holds a 77% "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 60 reviews, indicating generally positive reviews. The critical consensus states: "Hallucinatory but lacking in characterization, ''Kundun'' is a young Dalai Lama portrait presented as a feast of sight and sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kundun/ |title=Kundun Reviews |publisher= [[Flixster]]  | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reviews===

The film according to [[Roger Ebert]] was "made of episodes, not a plot".&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980116/REVIEWS/801160305/1023 Review] by [[Roger Ebert]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "emotionally remote" while praising its look and its score: "The movie is a triumph for the cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]], who has given it the look of an illuminated manuscript. As its imagery becomes more surreal and mystically abstract, Mr. Glass's ethereal electronic score, which suggests a Himalayan [[music of the spheres]], gathers force and energy and the music and pictures achieve a sublime synergy."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] praised the cinematography and score as well: "Aided by Roger Deakins' pristine camera work and the euphoric [[Drone music|drone]] of Philip Glass's score, Scorsese devises a poem of textures and silences. Visions, nightmares and history blend in a tapestry as subtle as the Tibetans' gorgeous [[mandala]]s of sand."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; 

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, saying: "There is rarely the sense that a living, breathing and (dare I say?) fallible human inhabits the body of the Dalai Lama. Unlike Scorsese's portrait of Jesus in ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'', this is not a man striving for perfection, but perfection in the shape of a man. ... Once we understand that ''Kundun'' will not be a drama involving a plausible human character, we are freed to see the film as it is: an act of devotion, an act even of spiritual desperation, flung into the eyes of 20th century{{sic}} materialism. The film's visuals and music are rich and inspiring, and like a mass by Bach or a Renaissance church painting, it exists as an aid to worship: It wants to enhance, not question."&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; [[David Edelstein]] called the movie a [[hagiography]] whose "music ties together all the pretty pictures, gives the narrative some momentum, and helps to induce a kind of alert detachment, so that you're neither especially interested nor especially bored."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/3241 |title=Holding Their Fire |accessdate=2008-09-23 |last=Edelstein |first=David |date=December 26, 1997 |publisher=Slate }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barry Norman]], chief film critic at the [[BBC]] opined that ''Kundun'' was "beautifully and intelligently made, far more impressive, for instance, than the recent ''[[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven Years in Tibet]]''".&lt;ref name="Radio Times"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|authorlink=Barry Norman|title=Martin Scorsese's KUNDUN conundrum|journal=[[Radio Times]]|volume=|issue=|pages=|date=April 4–10, 1998|url=|doi=|id=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As ''Kundun'' was released in the UK four months after its original release, Norman was able to probe Scorsese about the film's promotion. Writing about his interview with Scorsese, Norman said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yet it seems to be Scorsese, rather than the studio, who is doing most to promote the film. So I asked him "Did Disney back you up when it came out? Did they really put themselves behind it to try to sell it?" Now Scorsese is a decent and diplomatic man, who likes to be fair to everybody, but eventually he said: "I personally think that, unfortunately, they didn't push the picture." For fear of offending China? "Who knows?" he said. But, perhaps significantly, he also said: "The market China represents is enormous, not just for Disney but many other corporations around the world."&lt;ref name="Radio Times"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Maria Pierina De Micheli''' (1890–1945) was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[religious Sister]] who was born near [[Milan]] in [[Italy]]. She is best known for her association with the [[Holy Face of Jesus]] (one of the [[Catholic devotions]]) and for introducing a medal bearing an image from the [[Shroud of Turin]] as part of this devotion.

In April 2009 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] advanced her [[Beatification|beatification process]] by formally recognizing a miracle attributed to her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=15590 Pope approves heroic virtues for ten on path to canonization, including the Brazilian ‘Mother Teresa’] [[Catholic News Agency]]. April 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; She was beatified on Sunday 30 May 2010 at the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome by Archbishop [[Angelo Amato]], Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] in the [[Roman Curia]]. Although he was not present for the beatification Mass, Pope Benedict XVI noted her "extraordinary devotion" to the Holy Face of Christ at the [[Angelus]] audience the following Sunday.&lt;ref name=CNAMay30&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/holy-face-nun-beatified-remembered-by-pope-benedict-xvi/ |title=Holy Face nun beatified, remembered by Pope Benedict XVI |date=May 30, 2010 |publisher= [[Catholic News Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/angelus/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_ang_20100530_en.html Vatican website: ''Pope Benedict XVI Angelus'', 30 May 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
She was born Giuseppina De Micheli in Milan on 11 September 1890.&lt;ref name=santi&gt;[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/94958 "Beata Maria Pierina", Santi e Beati, May 19, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; She had been aware from an early age of the [[Holy Face of Jesus]] devotion, which had been started almost a century earlier by a French [[Carmelite]] [[nun]], Sister [[Marie of St Peter]], of [[Tours]], France. Giuseppina joined the Congregation of the Daughters of the Immaculate Conception in October 1913, and took the name Sister Maria Pierina on 16 May 1914, when she made her [[religious vows|vows]]. She was then sent to the motherhouse in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she remained until 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vultuschristi.org/index.php/2007/12/the-venerable-mother-maria-pie/ "Venerable Mother Maria Pierina De Micheli", ''Vultus Christi'', Silverstream Priory, December 17, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; While there, her attachment to the Holy Face devotion grew stronger. After her return to Milan she was eventually elected as the mother superior of her house and began to spread the devotion.

==Visions==
{{Holy Face of Jesus}}
[[File:Grab MadrePierina.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tomb of Blessed Maria Pierina.]]
On the [[First Friday Devotions|first Friday]] in [[Lent]] 1936 she reported a [[vision of Christ]] in which Jesus appeared to her and said: ''“I will that My Face, which reflects the intimate pains of My Spirit, the suffering and the love of My Heart, be more honored. He who meditates upon Me, consoles Me”''. Further reported visions of Jesus and Mary urged Sister Maria Pierina to make a medal with the Holy Face of Jesus.&lt;ref name=santi/&gt; After some effort, she managed to obtain permission to reproduce the photograph of the [[Shroud of Turin]] and  authorization from the [[Curia (Roman Catholic Church)|Curia]] in Milan to proceed with the medal in 1940. This became known as the Holy Face Medal.

On one side the medal bears a replica of the Holy Shroud of Turin and an inscription based on Psalm 66:2: "Illumina, Domine, vultum tuum super nos", i.e. ''"May, O Lord, the light of Thy countenance shine upon us"''. On the other side of the medal, there is an image of a radiant [[Sacred Host]], the [[monogram]] of the [[Holy Name]] ("[[Christogram|IHS]]"), and the inscription "Mane nobiscum, Domine" i.e. ''"Stay with us, O Lord"''.

==Approval of the Holy Face medal==
The first medal of the Holy Face was offered to [[Pope Pius XII]] who approved the devotion and the medal. She had also reported that Jesus wanted a special Feast on the day before [[Ash Wednesday]] in honor of His Holy Face, to be preceded by a Novena (9 days) of prayers. In 1958, [[Pope Pius XII]] declared the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus as [[Shrove Tuesday]] (the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday) for all Roman Catholics.

==Final years==
In 1941 she wrote in her diary: ''"I feel a deep longing to live always united to Jesus, to love Him intensely because my death can only be a transport of love with my Spouse, Jesus."'' Sister Maria Pierina died on 26 June 1945 in Milan.&lt;ref name=santi/&gt; Her remains are located at the Holy Spirit Institute in Rome.

'''Piotr Marian Massonius''' (1 February 1862 in [[Kursk]], [[Russian Empire]] – 20 July 1945 in [[Vilnius|Vilnius (Wilno)]], prewar [[Second Polish Republic]]) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[philosopher]] and [[teacher]] who was born into a family of [[expatriates]] during the [[Partitions of Poland]].

==Life==
Massonius studied [[law]] at the [[Warsaw University]] and then abroad, where he took up philosophical and pedagogical studies at various German universities, mainly in [[Leipzig]]. He became one of the representatives of the [[Warsaw]] school of [[Positivism]] who formed a common front against [[Messianism]] together with the Polish [[Neo-Kantian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'' (History of Philosophy), 3 vols., Warsaw, [[Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe]], 1978; vol. 3, pp. 177–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[Second Polish Republic|Poland's return to independence]], Massonius wrote for the Polish-language [[St. Petersburg]] weekly ''Kraj'' and contributed to the Polish-language periodicals ''Głos'', ''Tygodnik Ilustrowany'', ''Wisła'', ''Gazeta Warszawska'' and ''Gazeta Polska''. In 1897-1914 he served on the editorial board of ''Przegląd Filozoficzny'' (The Philosophical Review). In 1906 Massonius was elected to Russia's first [[State Duma of the Russian Empire|National Duma]]. In 1906-14 he lectured at Warsaw's [[Flying University]], and  in 1920-32, as a professor he conducted courses in philosophy and pedagogy at [[Stefan Batory University]] in [[Vilnius]], then part of the [[Second Polish Republic]]; in these, he focused on [[epistemology]] and [[aesthetics]]. He became [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the [[Humanities]] Department there. His writings included a collection of philosophical essays, and Polish translations of Western philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant]], Émile Tardieu and [[Schopenhauer]].&lt;ref name="OMP"&gt;{{en icon}} Ośrodek Myśli Politycznej (Center for Political Thought), 1998; [http://www.omp.org.pl/massonius_ang.php  Marian Massonius (1862-1945)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727034317/http://www.omp.org.pl/massonius_ang.php |date=2009-07-27 }} with selected fragments from his essay "On Bolshevism".&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 21 September 1920, in [[Poznań]], Massonius published an essay ''On Bolshevism'', including observations on the 1847 ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' of [[Marx]] and [[Engels]]. As one of the first Polish scholars following the 1917 Russian Revolution, he warned that communist ideology was merely a tool that enabled the [[Bolsheviks]] to assume the political role of a new ruling class in [[Russia|Russian]] society. Workers and peasants – Massonius wrote – were to become an embellishment for the [[commissars]] corresponding roughly to the former [[Tsarist]] governors, heads of administrative districts (''[[volost]]s''), prosecutors, heads of treasury offices, directors of school departments, and so on.

He wrote that the new ruling elite, comprising members of the  [[Cheka]] (Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counterrevolution and Sabotage) and [[Red Army]] officers, regarded as the "right-thinking", had only one thing in common as in every [[oligarchy]]. That is, they all represented communist clubs formed in every Soviet town. These clubs constituted the actual, though unofficial government, or rather the body overseeing the activities of the official government. From the very beginning the aim of the revolutionaries was not to bring about Marxist equality among the classes, but to create a new privileged class of their own. Civil equality was never their goal, it was only an object of subversive political manipulation justifying the means, he explained.&lt;ref name="OMP" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5846">'''Mary Fulkerson''' is a [[Dance education|dance teacher]] and [[Choreography|choreographer]], born in the [[United States]], who developed an approach to expressive [[human]] [[Kinesiology|movement]] called 'Anatomical Release Technique' in the US and [[United Kingdom|UK]], and &lt;ref&gt;Bannerman, H., A Question of Somatics - The Search For A Common Framework For Twenty-First-Century Contemporary Dance Pedagogy: Graham And Release-Based Techniques'. Journal of Dance &amp; Somatic Practices, Vol, 2, No. 1, 2010, pp.5-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lepkoff, D. 'What is Release Technique'. Movement Research Performance Journal, 19, Vol. 19, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; which has influenced the practice of [[Dance therapy|dance movement therapy]], as seen in the clinical work of [[Bonnie Meekums]],&lt;ref&gt;Meekums, B., Dance Movement Therapy: A Creative Psychotherapeutic Approach. Sage, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[postmodern dance]], as exemplified by the choreography of [[Motionhouse|Kevin Finnan]],&lt;ref&gt;Butterworth, J.,  Dance Studies: The Basics. Routledge, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and the application of [[guided meditation]] and [[guided imagery]], as seen in the [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] work of [[Paul Newham]].&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P., Using Voice and Movement in Therapy. Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Fulkerson's primary contribution to [[dance]], [[dance therapy]], and [[guided meditation]] derives from the way she taught [[dance]]rs and non-dancers how to use their own [[mental imagery]] to motivate expressive movement,&lt;ref&gt;Meekums, B., 'Spontaneous Symbolism in Clinical Supervision: Moving Beyond Logic'. Body, Movement and Dance in Psychotherapy, Vol. 2, Issue 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which she developed upon the principles and practices previous established by [[Mabel Elsworth Todd|Mabel Todd]], [[Barbara Clark (movement teacher)|Barbara Clark]], [[Lulu Sweigard]],&lt;ref&gt;Sweigard, L. E., Human Movement Potential: Its Ideokinetic Facilitation. Allegro Editions, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Skinner Releasing Technique|Joan Skinner]],&lt;ref&gt;Todd, M. E.. The Thinking Body: A Study of the Balancing Forces of Dynamic Man. Dance Books Limited, 1977. First published 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt P., and Clark B., A Kinesthetic Legacy: The Life and Works of Barbara Clark. CMT Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rolland, J., Inside Motion: An Ideokinetic Basis for Movement Education. Rolland String Research Associates, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, A., Steinmuller, W., and  Stricker, U., Applied Ideokinesis: A Creative Approach to Human Movement and Body Alignment. North Atlantic Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; evolving her main teachings at [[Dartington College of Arts]] between 1973 and 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Childs, P., and Storry, M., Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture. Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

These teachers developed an approach to [[Physical therapy|rehabilitative physical education]], [[choreography]], and [[improvisation|improvised]] [[dance]] that had in common the facilitation of healthy and expressive movement through volitional use of [[imagination]], which involved visualizing the structure and motion of the body, and allowing this [[Proprioception|kinaesthetic]] [[imagery]] to inform the way they moved. The term '[[ideokinesis]]' denotes use of such [[imagery]] to rehabilitate and precipitate human movement, which [[Lulu Sweigard|Sweigard]] borrowed from the American piano teacher [[Bonpensière]], who used imagery in his music teaching, and invented the word by combining two words derivivative of Greek:  'ideo' for idea or thought, and 'kinesis' for movement.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, A.,. 'An Introduction to Ideokinesis'. Contact Quarterly Vol. 22 Issue 2, 1997, 23-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Overby, L. Y. and Dunn, J., 'The History and Research Of Dance Imagery: Implications For Teachers'. The IADMS Bulletin for Teachers, Volume 3, Issue 2, 2011, pp9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, D.,  Teaching Dancing with Ideokinetic Principles. University of Illinois Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulkerson initiated two developments in the work established by her predecessors. Firstly, she extended the type of [[Mental image|imagery]] used by her students and [[dance]]rs in both [[Choreography|choreographed]] and [[Improvisation|improvised]] [[dance]] beyond the [[Anatomy|anatomical]] and [[Proprioception|kinesthetic]]. This enabled her students and [[dance]]rs to physicalize and embody a range of [[Mental image|images]], including [[Entity|entities]], [[animal]]s, and [[Character (arts)|characters]]. Secondly, she prepared her [[dance]]rs and students for practice, [[rehearsal]], and [[Performing arts|performance]] using a technique comparable to [[guided meditation]], [[guided imagery]], and [[creative visualization]], verbally suggesting [[Imagery|images]] as the members of her ensemble or class lay still, becoming increasingly [[Awareness|aware]] of their body prior to initiating [[Kinesiology|movement]]. As a consequence, Fulkerson's approach to [[dance education]] has been described as a form of [[movement meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;Mock, R., Performing Processes. Intellect Books, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, A., The Place of Dance: A Somatic Guide to Dancing and Dance Making. Wesleyan University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Studd, K. A., 'Ideokinesis, Mental Rehearsal and Relaxation Applied To Dance Technique'. Masters Thesis. University of Oregon, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, D., 'Reprise: On Dance Ethnography'.

He is the editor-in-chief of ''[[Journal of Philosophy of Life]]'' and an associate editor of ''[[Eubios Journal of Asian and International Bioethics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eubios.info/ejaib_journal EJAIB website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Morioka was born in [[Kōchi Prefecture]], Japan, in 1958 and entered [[The University of Tokyo]] in 1977. In the beginning he studied physics and mathematics but he later turned to philosophy and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Interview in [http://www.nakanishiya.co.jp/book/b308306.html 哲学者に会いにゆこう２ 2017].&lt;/ref&gt; In graduate school he specialized in bioethics and environmental ethics, a newly emerging field at that time as well as Wittgenstein’s later philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Masahiro Morioka, “The Structure of the Inner Life of a Philosopher: The Multi-Layered Aspects of Speech,” in Tetsuo Yamaori (ed.) Nihonjin no Shisô no Jusôsei: Watashi no Shiza kara Kangaeru. Chikuma Shobo. April 1998, pp.77-100. (In Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; He published two books on bioethics, ''An Invitation to the Study of Life'' and ''Brain Dead Person'', and moved to the [[International Research Center for Japanese Studies]], [[Kyoto]], in 1988. There he wrote several books including ''How to Live in a Post-religious Age'' and ''Consciousness Communication''; the former is a philosophical and psychological analysis of [[Aum Shinrikyo]]’s [[sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway]] that occurred in 1995&lt;ref&gt;Interview "科学万能改める時期"
 北海道新聞 March 16, 1996. "同世代の「生」語る３０代" 読売新聞 June 29, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter discusses subconscious interactions in the age of computer communications (''Consciousness Communication'' won The Telecom Social Science award in 1993). He spent one year as a visiting scholar at [[Wesleyan University]], Connecticut, USA, in 1991.

In 1997, he moved to [[Osaka Prefecture University]] where he taught philosophy and ethics. In 2001 he published ''Life Studies Approaches to Bioethics'', in which he discussed brain death and organ transplantation, feminist bioethics and abortion, the [[disability rights]] movement, and new forms of eugenics from the perspective of “life studies.” In this book he introduces concepts such as "the fundamental sense of security" and "the reality of a deeply shaken self", which he discovered through an examination of Japanese bioethics literature written in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;“Life Studies Approaches to Bioethics” [http://www.keisoshobo.co.jp/book/b26432.html Publisher’s webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; He published ''Painless Civilization'', mentioned above, in 2003. This is considered by many his most important and influential book to date.&lt;ref&gt;[https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/38190961.pdf Takahiro Miura "「出口のない道」のその先 : 森岡正博『無痛文明論』によせて" PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; His books on men’s studies, also mentioned above, have been frequently referred to in the field of gender studies.&lt;ref&gt;[See https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/05/05/national/social-issues/professor-examines-lolita-complex-first-looking-experience/#.WhqFulVl-po Japan Times] etc.&lt;/ref&gt; He published ''The Cartoon Introduction to Philosophy'' in 2013. He played an important role in the revision of the organ transplantation law in Japan in the years 2000-2009. He asserted that organs should not be harvested from small children who have been declared brain dead but his proposal was ultimately rejected by the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndl.go.jp/jp/diet/publication/issue/0440.pdf　子どもの脳死と臓器移植] Diet of Japan Report, February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to the School of Human Sciences, [[Waseda University]], in 2015.

== Key concepts ==

=== Brain death as a human relationship ===
Morioka defines [[brain death]] not as a material process occurring inside the brain but as a human relationship formed between a comatose patient and his/her family members or others who surround him/her. He calls this a "human relationship oriented analysis" approach to bioethics. He claims that brain death is not necessarily human death.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Lock [https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520228146''Twice Dead: Organ Transplants and the Reinvention of Death''] 2001, University of California Press. Reconsidering Brain Death: A Lesson from Japan's Fifteen Years of Experience. {{cite web|url=http://www.georgetown.edu/research/nrcbl/hcr/v31/h31n4p41.pdf |title=PDF |accessdate=2011-06-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614120759/http://www.georgetown.edu/research/nrcbl/hcr/v31/h31n4p41.pdf |archivedate=June 14, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consciousness communication ===
In his 1993 book ''Consciousness Communication'' he distinguished "consciousness communication", communication for the purpose of social interaction itself, from "information communication", communication used as a tool for conveying information. He predicted that consciousness communication would play a central role in the coming information society, and put forward the concepts of "community of anonymity" and "dream navigator".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifestudies.org/consciousness00.html ''Consciousness Communication''].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life studies ===
Morioka calls his comprehensive approach to the issues of life, death, and nature "life studies". The ultimate goal of life studies is to help people to live their lives without regret. Morioka asserts that the most important aspect of life studies is never to detach ourselves from the problems we are tackling and never to think of ourselves as exceptions; He encourages us to keep our eyes on our own desires and the evil that he believes is deeply engraved in our hearts.&lt;ref&gt;Epilogue of [http://www.philosophyoflife.org/tpp/frigid.pdf Confessions of a Frigid Man].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fundamental sense of security ===
The fundamental sense of security is one of the central concepts in Morioka’s philosophy. In the book ''Life Studies Approaches'' to Bioethics he describes this as "a sense of security that allows me to strongly believe that even if I had been unintelligent, ugly, or disabled, my existence in the world itself would have been equally welcomed, and whether I succeed or fail, and even if I become a doddering old man, my existence will continue to be welcomed". He asserts that this is a precondition of our being able to live our lives without regret.&lt;ref&gt;Yasunobu Nozaki, [http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/118 "Review of Masahiro Morioka. Life Studies Approaches to Bioethics: A New Perspective on Brain Death, Feminism, and Disability"] ''Disability Studies Quarterly'', 28(3), 2008. Painless Civilization and Fundamental Sense of Security: A Philosophical Challenge in the Age of Human Biotechnology. [http://them.polylog.org/6/fmm-en.htm HTML]. 鷲田清一『京都新聞』February 14, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Painless civilization ===
Morioka asserts that our contemporary civilization is developing in the form of a "painless civilization". He asserts that this civilization's limitless penchant for eliminating pain and suffering makes us completely lose sight of the meaning of life that is indispensable to human beings and deprives us of the joy of life in exchange for pleasure, pleasantness, and comfort. He further claims that people in advanced countries know that they are drowning in the tide of their painless civilization but do not know how to escape from it.&lt;ref&gt;Painless Civilization and Fundamental Sense of Security: A Philosophical Challenge in the Age of Human Biotechnology. [http://them.polylog.org/6/fmm-en.htm HTML]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview "たのしい不便" 毎日新聞 October 15, 1999. Interview "「無痛文明」から脱出できますか" 産経新聞 February 15, 2000. "痛み失う現代文明" 日本経済新聞 November 22, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The desire of the body and the desire of life ===
Morioka distinguishes between two kinds of desires: the desire of the body and the desire of life. The former is the desire to expand the amount of one's pleasure, property, and stability, and the latter is the desire to dismantle the former, throw away pleasure, property, and stability, and change into a being in a different state of mind and body.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2 of 無痛文明論, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frigid man ===
Morioka uses the phrase "frigid man" to describe a man who suffers from sexual frigidity caused by "male frigidity" and has a (sub-conscious) attraction toward young girls, especially girls wearing school uniforms. Many Japanese adult males suffer from this condition and love to see the images of young girls in the mass media and on the Internet. This is the pathology hidden behind the Japanese male's "Lolita complex".&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions of a Frigid Man: A Philosopher's Journey into the Hidden Layers of Men's Sexuality'' [http://www.philosophyoflife.org/tpp/frigid.pdf PDF]. [https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/05/05/national/social-issues/professor-examines-lolita-complex-first-looking-experience/#.WhqFulVl-po ''Japan Times'', MAY 5, 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Herbivore men ===
In Morioka's writings, "[[herbivore men]]" are timid young Japanese men who are inexperienced and unassertive in love and sex. Just after the publication of Morioka's book, ''Lessons in Love for Herbivore Boys'', 2008, the term "herbivore men" became a buzz word in Japan and was reported worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2009/05/10/general/blurring-the-boundaries/#.WhqE6VVl-po "Blurring the boundaries"] ''Japan Times'', MAY 10, 2009. Nicolae Raluca, [http://www.rebe.rau.ro/RePEc/rau/journl/FA14/REBE-FA14-A8.pdf "Sōshoku(kei) Danshi:The (Un)gendered Questions on Contemporary Japan"] Romanian Economic and Business Review 9(31), 2014.

=== Philosophy of life ===
The philosophy of life is a new discipline in contemporary philosophy that aims to examine the topics of life, death, and nature from various philosophical angles. It widens the scope of the 19th century's Lebensphilosophie and encompasses contemporary bioethics, environmental philosophy, philosophy of biology, biopolitics, the study of the meaning of human life, and other areas of research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifestudies.org/press/rls0802.pdf "Philosophy of Life in Contemporary Society" PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birth affirmation ===
This is one of the key concepts in Morioka's philosophy of life. Birth affirmation means to be able to say yes, from the bottom of our hearts, to the fact that we have been born. Morioka distinguishes "birth affirmation" from similar concepts such as "survival affirmation" and "affirmation of one's whole life". He considers "birth denial" as the worst form of human evil.&lt;ref&gt;Tanjō Kōtei to wa Nani ka [http://www.lifestudies.org/jp/tanjo01.htm HTML]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dignity of human life ===
He criticized and enlarged Kant's idea of dignity and proposed three kinds of dignity in human life, namely, "dignity of one's life," dignity of a one-off life of a human being, "dignity of the body," dignity of having the body, and "dignity of connected life," dignity of being connected to other human beings and non-human creatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifestudies.org/jp/dignity01.htm Ningen no Inochi no Songen ni tsuite no Yobiteki Kousatsu]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62934">{{short description|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints takes no official position on whether or not biological evolution has occurred}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) takes no official position on whether or not [[Evolution|biological evolution]] has occurred, nor on the validity of the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]] as a [[Theory#Science|scientific theory]]. In the 20th century, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] of the LDS Church published doctrinal statements on the origin of man and creation. In addition, individual leaders of the LDS Church have expressed a variety of personal opinions on evolution, many of which have affected the beliefs and perceptions of Latter-day Saints.

==Official LDS Church doctrine==
The LDS Church has no official position on the theory of evolution or the details of "what happened on earth before Adam and Eve, including how their bodies were created."&lt;ref name="Point" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harrison|first1=Mette Ivie|title=New Church Problems: Mormonism|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mette-ivie-harrison/new-church-problems-mormo_b_8991496.html|accessdate=9 September 2017|work=The Huffington Post|date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, some [[general authority|general authorities]] of the LDS Church have made statements suggesting that, in their opinion, evolution is opposed to scriptural teaching. [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostles]] [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] and [[Bruce R. McConkie]] were among the most well-known advocates of this position. Other church authorities and members have made statements suggesting that, in their opinion, evolution is not in opposition to scriptural doctrine. Examples of this position include Elders [[B. H. Roberts]], [[James E. Talmage]], and [[John A. Widtsoe]].&lt;ref name="Harmony" /&gt;{{rp|vii,xi-xiv}}

While maintaining its "no position" stance, the LDS Church has produced a number of official publications that have included discussion and personal statements from these various church leaders on evolution and the "origin of man." These statements generally adopt the position, as a church-approved encyclopedia entry{{efn|The entry on evolution in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]'' was approved by [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]] [[Neal A. Maxwell]] and [[Dallin H. Oaks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1= William E. |last1= Evenson |first2= Duane E. |last2= Jeffrey |year= 2005 |title= Mormonism and Evolution: The Authoritative LDS Statements |place= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= Greg Kofford Books |isbn= 1589580931 |oclc= 62090739 |page= 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!----&gt; states, "[t]he scriptures tell why man was created, but they do not tell how, though the Lord has promised that he will tell that when he comes again."&lt;ref name = EOM&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first= William E. |last= Evenson |contribution= Evolution |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/3666 |page= 478 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Presidency Statements===
There have been three authoritative public statements (1909, 1910, and 1925) and one private statement (1931) given from the LDS Church's highest authority, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], that represents the Church's doctrinal position on the origin of mankind.&lt;ref name="Stance"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Carrie A.|title=No definitive LDS stance on evolution, study finds|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/635188399/No-definitive-LDS-stance-on-evolution-study-finds.html|accessdate=7 July 2017|work=Deseret News|agency=Deseret Digital Media|publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|date=1 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1909 and 1925 statements of the First Presidency have been subsequently endorsed by church leaders such as [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Boyd K. Packer]] in 1988.&lt;ref name = BKP&gt;Boyd K. Packer (1988), "The Law and the Light", ''Book of Mormon Symposium'', BYU, (30 October 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2002 the entire 1909 First Presidency message was reprinted in the Church's [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1-last= Smith |author1-first= Joseph F. |author1-link= Joseph F.

====1909 statement "The Origin of Man"====
Historically, the Latter-day Saints were isolated in the western plains when ''The Origin of Species'' was published by Charles Darwin in 1859.&lt;ref name="laird" /&gt;{{rp|30}} Consequently, there was little discussion about evolution among Latter-day Saint communities. The Latter-day Saints were trying to survive and build settlements in Utah and evolution was not a prominent concern for them.&lt;ref name="laird" /&gt;{{rp|31}} [[George Q. Cannon]] of the Quorum of the Twelve responded to Darwin in 1861, stated that revelation is superior to science, but considered the possibility of evolution among animals and plants. This was and is not considered doctrine.&lt;ref name="laird" /&gt;{{rp|39}}  The building of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 allowed for the Saints to gain access to outside ideas and influences. Because of this new knowledge, LDS schools sought to combat scientific theories such as evolution with faith. Publications helped reaffirm church doctrine; however, views on evolution were mixed. Some believed a belief in evolution was equivalent to atheism, whereas some sought to find common ground between evolution and faith.&lt;ref name="laird" /&gt;{{rp|39–40}} Due to the many differing opinions that emerged, in the early 1900s, the LDS Church began to officially respond to the theories that had already been discussed for nearly fifty years.&lt;ref name="laird" /&gt;{{rp|31}}

The first official statement from the First Presidency on the issue of evolution was in 1909, the centennial of [[Charles Darwin]]'s birth and the 50th anniversary of the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|Church president]] [[Joseph F. Smith]] appointed a committee headed by [[Orson F. Whitney]], a member of Quorum of the Twelve, to prepare an official statement,&lt;ref name=MAE /&gt; "basing its belief on divine revelation, ancient and modern, proclaim[ing] man to be the direct and lineal offspring of Deity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gospel Classics: By the First Presidency of the Church |url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/2002/02/the-origin-of-man?lang=eng |website=lds.org |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saintsh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="First Presidency 1909"&gt;{{citation |author1-last= Smith |author1-first= Joseph F. |author1-link= Joseph F.

In addition, the statement declares human evolution as one of the "theories of men", but falls short of explicitly declaring it untrue or evil. It states that, "man began life as a human being, in the likeness of our heavenly father". Moreover, it states that although man begins life as a germ or embryo, it does not mean that, "[Adam] began life as anything less than a man, or less than the human germ or embryo that becomes a man"&lt;ref name="First Presidency 1909" /&gt; Supported by signatures from the First Presidency, the statement was published in November 1909.&lt;ref name=MAE /&gt;

The statement did not define the origins of animals other than humans, nor did it venture into any more specifics regarding the origin of man.&lt;ref name="First Presidency 1909" /&gt;

====1910 statement "Words in Season from the First Presidency"====
In response to continual questions from church members regarding evolution, as well as problems preceding the 1911 Brigham Young University modernism controversy,&lt;ref name=MAE /&gt; in its 1910 [[Christmas]] message, the First Presidency made reference to the church's position on science. It stated that the church is not hostile to science and that "diversity of opinion does not necessitate intolerance of spirit". The message continues by stating that proven science is accepted with joy, but theories, speculation, or anything contrary to revelation or common sense is not accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1-last= Smith |author1-first= Joseph F. |author1-link= Joseph F.

====1925 statement "Mormon View of Evolution"====
In 1925, in the midst of the [[Scopes Trial]] in [[Tennessee]], a new First Presidency issued an official statement which reaffirmed the doctrine that [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] was the first man upon the earth and that he was created in the image of [[God the Father|God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origin of Man &amp; Organic Evolution|date=2004|publisher=Brigham Young University-Idaho|location=Rexburg, Idaho|pages=2–3|url=http://emp.byui.edu/marrottr/OriginOfMan.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805030919/http://emp.byui.edu/marrottr/OriginOfMan.pdf|archivedate=5 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='Mormon' View of Evolution|journal=Improvement Era|date=September 1925|volume=28|issue=11|pages=1090–1091|url=https://archive.org/stream/improvementera28011unse#page/1088/mode/2up|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=Heber|last2=Ivins|first2=Anthony|last3=Nibley|first3=Charles|title='Mormon' View of Evolution|journal=Deseret News|date=18 July 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a short article in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]'' which is largely composed of quotes from the 1909 and 1925 statements,&lt;ref name = EOM/&gt; and the First Presidency has not publicly issued an official statement on evolution since 1925. It states that men and women are created in the image of the "universal Father and Mother", and Adam, like Christ was a pre-existing spirit who took a body to become a "living soul". It continues by stating that because man is "endowed with divine attributes", he "is capable, by experience through ages and aeons, of evolving into a God."&lt;ref name = MAE&gt;William E.

The 1925 statement is shorter than the 1909 statement, containing selected excerpts from the 1909 statement. "Anti-science" language was removed and the title was altered from "The Origin of Man" to "Mormon' View of Evolution".&lt;ref name=MAE /&gt; The comment which concluded that theories of evolution are "theories of men" in the 1909 official statement was no longer included in the 1925 official statement.&lt;ref name="ash"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ash |first1=Michael R. |title=The Mormon Myth of Evil Evolution |journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought |date=Winter 2002 |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=19–38 |url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V35N04_33.pdf |accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}}

====1931 statement "First Presidency Minutes"====
In April 1931 the First Presidency sent out a lengthy memo to all church general authorities in response to the debate between B. H. Roberts of the Presidency of the Seventy and Joseph Fielding Smith of the Quorum of the Twelve on the existence of pre-Adamites.&lt;ref name=MAE /&gt; The memo stated the Church's neutral stance on the existence of pre-Adamites.&lt;ref name="Harmony"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sherlock|first1=Richard|last2=Keller|first2=Jeffrey E.|title=The Search for Harmony: Essays on Science and Mormonism|date=1993|publisher=Signature Books|location=Salt Lake City|isbn=1-56085-020-5|url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/the-search-for-harmony/|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|97}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=B.H.|title=The Truth, The Way, The Life: An Elementary Treaties on Theology|date=15 March 1995|publisher=Signature Books|location=Salt Lake City|isbn=1560850779|edition=1|url=http://signaturebooks.com/excerpts-the-truth-the-way-the-life/|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stance" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sherlock|first1=Richard|title='We Can See No Advantage to a Continuation of the Discussion': The Roberts/Smith/Talmage Affair|journal= 	Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|date=Fall 1980|volume=13|issue=3|pages=70–71|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V13N03_65.pdf|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official Church publications==
The subject of evolution has been addressed in several official publications of the Church.

===General conference speeches===

The LDS Church has published several [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]] talks mentioning evolution. In the October 1984 conference apostle [[Boyd K. Packer]] stated that "no one with reverence for God could believe that His children evolved from slime or from reptiles" as well as affirming that "those who accept the theory of evolution don’t show much enthusiasm for genealogical research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Packer|first1=Boyd|title=The Pattern of Our Parentage|url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1984/10/the-pattern-of-our-parentage|website=lds.org|publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the April 2012 conference, apostle [[Russell M. Nelson]] discussed the human body stating "some people erroneously think that these marvelous physical attributes happened by chance or resulted from a big bang somewhere". He then compared this to an "explosion in a printing shop produc[ing] a dictionary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Russell|title=Thanks Be to God|url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1984/10/the-pattern-of-our-parentage|website=lds.org|publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instruction manuals===

====''Old Testament Student Manual''====

The ''Old Testament Student Manual'', published by the [[Church Educational System]], contains several quotes by general authorities as well as academics from a variety of backgrounds (both members of the Church and non-members) related to organic evolution and the origins of the earth.&lt;ref name = Reid&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Reid |first=Tim S. |date=2 May 1997 |title=Mormons and evolution: A history of B.

Furthermore, time has not modified them enough to change their basic relationships to each other.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 edition states that there is no official stance on the age of the Earth but that evidence for a longer process is substantial and very few people believe the earth was actually created in the space of one week. However, it also includes quote from Joseph Fielding Smith indicating his interpretation of Church doctrine as it pertains to the theory of organic evolution.  He asserts that organic evolution is incompatible and inconsistent with revelations from God and that to accept it is to reject the plan of salvation.&lt;ref name = OTSM&gt;Church Educational System (2003, 3d ed.). [http://www.lds.org/manual/old-testament-student-manual-genesis-2-samuel/genesis-1-2-the-creation "Genesis 1–2: The Creation"], ''Old Testament Student Manual Genesis – 2 Samuel'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) {{ISBN|1-81301-212-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Doctrine and Covenants and Church History Seminary Teacher Manual''====

[[Doctrine and Covenants]] 77:6 mentions "the seven thousand years of [the earth's] continuance, or its temporal existence", which has been interpreted by [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] and [[Bruce R. McConkie]] as a statement suggesting that the earth is no more than about six thousand years old (the seventh thousand-year period being the future [[Millennialism|millennium]]).{{efn|Joseph Fielding Smith: "We have evidence beyond dispute that Adam was driven out of the Garden of Eden about 6,000 years ago, or perhaps a short time less. ... In [Doctrine and Covenants] section 77:6–15, we have more information in relation to the opening of these seals [i.e., the seven seals mentioned in the Book of Revelation], with the following significant detail: 'Q. What are we to understand by the book which John saw, which was sealed on the back with seven seals? A. We are to understand that it contains the revealed will, mysteries, and works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor1-last= McConkie | editor1-first= Bruce R. | editor1-link= Bruce R.

However, in relation to this verse, the manual for [[seminary]] teachers explains: "It may be helpful to explain that the 7,000 years refers to the time since the Fall of Adam and Eve. It is not referring to the actual age of the earth including the periods of creation."&lt;ref name=DCCHSTM&gt;{{cite book|last=Church Educational System|title=Doctrine and Covenants and Church History Seminary Teacher Manual|year=2013|publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|page=280|url=http://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-and-church-history-seminary-teacher-manual-2014/section-4/lesson-82-doctrine-and-covenants-77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====BYU Library packet on evolution====

Since 1992 at the LDS-owned universities, a packet of authoritative statements approved by the BYU Board of Trustees (composed of the First Presidency of the Church and other general authorities and general auxiliary leaders) has been provided to students in classes when discussing the topic of organic evolution. The packet was assembled due to the large number of questions students had about evolution and the origins of man and is intended to be distributed along with other course material.&lt;ref name=MAE /&gt;{{rp|1–5}} The packet includes the first three Official First Presidency statements on the origin of man as well as the "Evolution" section in the ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'' which includes elements from the 1909 and 1925 statements as well as the 1931 "First Presidency Minutes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BYU Library Packet on Evolution|url=https://nelsonlab.byu.edu/Portals/27/docs/BYU_Evolution_Packet_only.pdf|website=byu.edu|publisher=BYU|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evenson|first1=William E.|title=Evolution Packet Defined|url=https://nelsonlab.byu.edu/Portals/27/docs/BYU_Evolution_Packet_defined.pdf|accessdate=20 February 2017|agency=Daily Universe|publisher=BYU|date=12 Nov 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official magazines===

====''Ensign''====

In 1982, the ''[[Ensign]]'', an official periodical of the church, published an article entitled "Christ and the Creation" by [[Bruce R. McConkie]], which stated that "[m]ortality and procreation and death all had their beginnings with the Fall."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce R. McConkie, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1982/06/christ-and-the-creation "Christ and the Creation,"] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', June 1982, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In an earlier edition of the ''Ensign'' published in 1980, McConkie stated that "the greatest heresy in the sectarian world ... is that God is a spirit nothingness which fills the immensity of space, and that creation came through evolutionary processes."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce R. McConkie, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1980/06/this-generation-shall-have-my-word-through-you "This Generation Shall Have My Word through You,"] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', June 1980, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''New Era''====

A July 2016 article for young adults acknowledged questions about how the age of the earth, dinosaurs, and evolution fit with church teachings, stating "it does all fit together, but there are still a lot of questions." The article offered no further explanation to how science and LDS teachings fit together, and stated "nothing that science reveals can disprove your faith" and told youth "not to get worried in the meantime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanton|first1=Alicia K.|title=Science and Our Search for Truth|url=https://www.lds.org/new-era/2016/07/science-and-our-search-for-truth?lang=eng|website=lds.org|publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later in the same magazine, the Church published an anonymously authored article stating that "the Church has no official position of the theory of evolution". The article continues by stating that the theory of organic evolution should be left for scientific study and that no details about the what happened before Adam and Eve and how their bodies were created have not been revealed, but the origin of man is clear from the teaching of the Church.&lt;ref name="Point"&gt;{{cite web|title=To the Point|url=https://www.lds.org/new-era/2016/10/to-the-point?lang=eng|website=lds.org|publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A much earlier anonymously authored article from 2004 did not attempt to reconcile church teachings and scientific views of evolution, but stated that not having the answers doesn’t discredit the existence of God, and that God won't reveal more unto us until we prove our faith. An example was provided of how the author avoided a classroom debate on evolution by stating that they knew God existed and created us. The article also quoted past church president [[Gordon Hinckley]] giving his own example of how he chose to drop the question and not let it bother him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Answer to Evolution|url=https://www.lds.org/new-era/2004/05/my-answer-to-evolution?lang=eng|website=lds.org|publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent letters from youth stated that the youth viewed themselves as against evolution and supportive of intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We’ve Got Mail|url=https://www.lds.org/new-era/2004/08/weve-got-mail?lang=eng|website=lds.org|publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous article in the New Era also showed youth viewing evolution as an antagonistic idea to their faith and becoming upset when it was taught&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Penrith|first1=Janice Turner|title=Feedback|url=https://www.lds.org/new-era/1979/06/feedback?lang=eng|website=lds.org|publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another featured a church seventy using scientific arguments in an attempt to disprove evolutionary [[natural selection]] and [[adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=George|title=Seek Ye Diligently|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1993/06/seek-ye-diligently?lang=eng|website=lds.org|publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Improvement Era''====

The ''[[Improvement Era]]'' was an official periodical of the Church between 1897 and 1970. In the April 1910 edition in the "Priesthood Quorum's Table" section of that periodical, Genesis 2:7 is cited as well as other scriptures from Genesis and the Pearl of Great Price. The article states that it is unclear whether the mortal bodies of man evolved through natural processes, whether Adam and Eve where transplanted to Earth from another place, or whether they were born on Earth in mortality. The article states that those questions are not fully answered in the Church's current revelation and scripture. The article cites the answer is attributed to the Church's First Presidency.&lt;ref name = MAE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Improvement Era]]'', April 10, 1910, vol. 13, p. 570&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canonized scriptures===

Some verses in the [[standard works]] raise questions about the compatibility of scriptural teachings and scientists' current understanding of organic evolution. One such verse, in [[Doctrine and Covenants]] section 77, verse 6, describes the "temporal existence" of the earth as 7,000 years old. The verse does not describe the process of creation, but if taken literally, implies that species may have appeared through a process faster than natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.fairmormon.org/Mormonism_and_science/Age_of_the_Earth&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scriptural verses suggest that no organisms died before the fall of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Fall_of_Adam&lt;/ref&gt; In the Book of Mormon, the prophet Lehi teaches: "If Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end" (2 Nephi 2:22). In [[Book of Moses|Moses]] 6:48 in the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]], the prophet Enoch states: "Because that Adam fell, we are; and by his fall came death; and we are made partakers of misery and woe."

===''Bible Dictionary''===

In the ''[[Bible Dictionary]]'' of the LDS Church, the entry for "Fall of Adam" includes the following statement: "Before the fall, Adam and Eve had physical bodies but no blood. There was no sin, no death, and no children among any of the earthly creations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bd/f/2 "Fall of Adam"], ''[[Bible Dictionary]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church).&lt;/ref&gt; Under the entry "Flesh", it is written: "Since flesh often means mortality, Adam is spoken of as the 'first flesh' upon the earth, meaning he was the first mortal on the earth, all things being created in a non-mortal condition, and becoming mortal through the fall of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bd/f/20 "Flesh"], ''[[Bible Dictionary]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church). pp. 670, 675.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, the ''Bible Dictionary'' is published by the LDS Church, and its preface states: "It [the ''Bible Dictionary''] is not intended as an official or revealed endorsement by the Church of the doctrinal, historical, cultural, and other matters set forth."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bible Dictionary]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church). p. 599.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statements from Church Presidents==
Every statement by a [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the LDS Church]] does not necessarily constitute official church doctrine, but a statement by a church president is generally regarded by church membership as authoritative and usually represents doctrine.  Official Church doctrine is however presented and taught by the entire First Presidency as a presidency, usually released in an official letter or other authorized publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How can I know if something I hear is "official doctrine"? |url=https://www.lds.org/new-era/2017/02/to-the-point/how-can-i-know-if-something-i-hear-is-official-doctrine?lang=eng |accessdate=October 24, 2018 |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Approaching Mormon Doctrine |url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/approaching-mormon-doctrine |accessdate=October 24, 2018 |work=Newsroom |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |date=May 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brigham Young===
[[Brigham Young]], the second president of the LDS Church, stated that the LDS Church differs from other Christian churches, because they do not seek to clash their ideas with scientific theory. He continued that whether God began with an empty Earth, whether he created out of nothing, whether he made it in six days or millions of years will remain a mystery unless God reveals revelation about it.&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young, (May 14, 1871) ''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' 14:116: http://en.fairmormon.org/Journal_of_Discourses/14/16#116&lt;/ref&gt; Young made the following statement two years later, stating the injustice the fact that the theories of scientists are taught in school, but not the principles of the gospel. He wrote that for this purpose, he created Brigham Young Academy, so that God's revelation could be taught in schools and the books are written by members of the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young, "Letter to his son Mr. Willard Young", [Salt Lake City, Utah, 14 April 1873].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean C. Jessee, ''Letters of Brigham Young to His Sons'', [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1974], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young Academy (2009). ''Brigham Young's Vision For Education''. Retrieved October 18, 2009 from Brigham Young Academy website: http://www.brighamyoungacademy.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Taylor===
[[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]] was the first President of the LDS Church to comment directly on [[Darwinian]] theory. In his 1882 book ''Mediation and Atonement'', Taylor stated that nature and creation is governed by the laws of man and organisms exist in the same form since creation, as contradicted by the ideas of evolutionists. Taylor continued that man did not originate from chaos of matter, but from "the faculties and powers of a God".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]] (1882). [http://www.kristus.dk/jkk/text.php?id=74100 ''An Examination Into and an Elucidation of the Great Principle of the Mediation and Atonement of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ''] (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret News) [http://www.kristus.dk/jkk/text.php?id=74123 p. 160].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joseph F. Smith===
Soon after the First Presidency's 1909 statement, [[Joseph F. Smith]] professed in an editorial that "the Church itself has no philosophy about the ''modus operandi'' employed by the Lord in His creation of the world."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Juvenile Instructor]]'', 46 (4), 208-209 (April 1911).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the very same month (and in the wake of the evolution controversy that had recently ensued at [[Brigham Young University]]), Smith published and signed a statement wherein he explained some of the conflicts between revealed religion and the theories of evolution. He cited the [[1911 Brigham Young University modernism controversy]], stating that evolution is in conflict with scriptures and modern revelation. He continues that the Church holds 
that "divine revelation" must be the "standard" and is "truth". Smith mentions that "science has changed from age to age", and "philosophic theories of life" have their place, but do not belong in LDS church school classes and anywhere else when they contradict the word of God.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Improvement Era]]'' vol. 14, p. 548 (April 1911).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1910 editorial in a Church magazine that enumerates various possibilities for creation is usually attributed to Smith or to the First Presidency.&lt;ref name = MAE/&gt; Included in the listed possibilities were the ideas that Adam and Eve: (1) "evolved in natural processes to present perfection"; (2) were "transplanted [to earth] from another sphere"; or (3) were "born here ... as other mortals have been."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Improvement Era]]'' vol. 13, p. 570 (April 1910).&lt;/ref&gt; Smith authored an editorial the next year in the Church magazine discouraging the discussion of evolution in Church school stating that members of the Church believe the theory of evolution was "more or less a fallacy." He also stated, however, that the Church "has no philosophy about the modus operandi employed by the Lord in His creation of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Joseph F.|title=Philosophy and the Church Schools|journal=Juvenile Instructor|date=April 1911|volume=46|issue=4|pages=208–209|url=https://archive.org/stream/juvenileinstruct464geor#page/208/mode/1up|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Smith stated about his views on evolution, "No Adam, no fall; no fall, no atonement; no atonement, no savior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paterson |first1=Frances R. A. |last2=Rossow |first2=Lawrence F. |title="Chained to the Devil's Throne": Evolution &amp; Creation Science as a Religio-Political Issue |journal=The American Biology Teacher |date=May 1999 |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=358–364 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/4450698.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A5259b7bac10441344b86c42f250d7e44 |accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===David O. McKay===
In a 1952 speech to students at [[Brigham Young University]], McKay used the theory of evolution as an example while suggesting that science can "leave [a student] with his soul unanchored". He stated that a professor that denies "divine agency in creation" imposes on the student that life was created by chance. McKay insisted that students should be led to a "counterbalancing thought" that "God is the Creator of the earth", "the Father of our souls and spirits", and "the purpose of creation is theirs (God and Jesus Christ)."&lt;ref&gt;[[David O. McKay]], "A Message for L.D.S. College Youth", 1952-10-08, printed in ''1952 BYU Speeches of the Year'' (Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University) pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the April 1968, at the [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]] held by the LDS Church, McKay's son [[David Lawrence McKay]] read a message on his father's behalf that was an edited version of the 1952 speech, including the omission of the word "beautiful" when describing the theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[David O. McKay]], ''Conference Report'', Apr. 1968, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, McKay quoted the Old Testament while affirming to members of the BYU faculty that living things only reproduce "after their kind". He quoted Genesis 1:24 which states, "Let the earth bring forth the living creatures after his kind, cattle and creeping things, and the beast of the earth after his kind."&lt;ref&gt;David O. McKay, "Some Fundamental Objectives of a Church University", BYU Faculty Workshop, September 17, 1954. Published in ''[[Deseret News]]'', 25 September 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spencer W. Kimball===
At a 1975 church women's conference, Church President [[Spencer W. Kimball]] quoted, "And, I God created man in mine own image, and in the image of mine Only Begotten created I him; male and female created I them. [At which point Kimball stated, "The story of the rib, of course, is figurative."] ... and later continued "we don't know exactly how [Adam and Eve's] coming into this world happened, and when we're able to understand it the Lord will tell us."&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer W. Kimball]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1976/03/the-blessings-and-responsibilities-of-womanhood "The Blessings and Responsibilities of Womanhood,"] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', March 1976, pp. 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ezra Taft Benson===
Prior to becoming president of the LDS Church, [[Ezra Taft Benson]] gave an April 1981 general conference address in which he stated that "the theory of man’s development from lower forms of life" is a "false idea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benson|first1=Ezra|title=Great Things Required of Their Fathers|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1981/05/great-things-required-of-their-fathers|website=lds.org|publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|quote=We have seen introduced into many school systems false ideas about the theory of man's development from lower forms of life ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, after becoming president of the churh, Benson published a book counseling members of the church to use the [[Book of Mormon]] to counter the theories of evolution. He wrote that "we have not been using the Book of Mormon as we should. Our homes are not as strong unless we are using it to bring our children to Christ. Our families may be corrupted by worldly trends and teachings unless we know how to use the book to expose and combat the falsehoods in ... organic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Ezra Taft Benson, ''A Witness and a Warning: A Modern-Day Prophet Testifies of the Book of Mormon'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 1988) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Benson published another book that included his earlier warnings&lt;ref&gt;Ezra Taft Benson, ''God, Family, Country: Our Three Great Loyalties'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 1974] p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; about the "deceptions" of Charles Darwin.  He wrote that educational institutions serve to mislead youth, which explains why the Church advises that youth attend LDS institutions, allowing parents to closely observe the education of their children and clear up "the deceptions of men like...Charles Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;Ezra Taft Benson, ''Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, 1988] p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gordon B. Hinckley===
In a 1997 speech at an [[Institute of Religion]] in [[Ogden, Utah]], Church President [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] said: "People ask me every now and again if I believe in evolution. I tell them I am not concerned with organic evolution. I do not worry about it. I passed through that argument long ago."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], 1997-04-15, reprinted in Gordon B. Hinckley (1999). ''Discourses of President Gordon B. Hinckley, Volume 1: 1995-1999'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Hinckley published his earlier teachings&lt;ref&gt;Gordon B. Hinckley, "Four Imperatives for Religious Educators" (address to religious educators, 15 September 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon B. Hinckley, “Four Imperatives for Religious Educators,” ''Religious Educator'' '''5''', no. 2 (2004): 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; wherein he contrasts "organic evolution" with the evolution and improvement of individuals:&lt;ref&gt;Gordon B. Hinckley, ''Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley'', p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, Hinckley recalled his university studies of evolution to reporter Larry A. Witham: "'Studied all about it. Didn't worry me then. Doesn't worry me now.'"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Larry A. Witham (2002). ''Where Darwin Meets the Bible: Creationists and Evolutionists in America'' (New York: Oxford University Press) p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, an official church magazine printed a quote from Hinckley from a 1983 speech where he expressed a similar sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], Salt Lake Institute of Religion speech, 1983-11-05, first printed as Gordon B.

==Statements from apostles==
In the early 1900s, many general authorities, specifically those with science backgrounds, subscribed to the idea of an old earth, yet most of them rejected [[Darwinism]]. Joseph Fielding Smith and other general authorities were against the old earth theory as well as Darwin's theory of evolution.&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt;{{rp|25–26}} Individual leaders of the Church have expressed a variety of personal opinions on biological evolution and as such do not necessarily constitute official Church doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Groups’ Views on Evolution|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2009/02/04/religious-groups-views-on-evolution/|website=pewforum.org|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russell M. Nelson===
Prior to becoming president of the LDS Church, [[Russell M. Nelson]] stated in a 2007 interview with the Pew Research Center that "to think that man evolved from one species to another is, to me, incomprehensible. Man has always been man. Dogs have always been dogs. Monkeys have always been monkeys. It's just the way genetics works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Focus: Mormonism in Modern America|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2007/05/16/in-focus-mormonism-in-modern-america/|website=Pew Research Forum|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated in 1987 in a church magazine that he found the theory of evolution unbelievable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Russell|title=The Magnificence of Man|url=https://www.lds.org/new-era/1987/10/the-magnificence-of-man?lang=eng|website=lds.org|publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=8 September 2017|quote=Through the ages, some without scriptural understanding have tried to explain our existence by pretentious words such as ex nihilo (out of nothing). Others have deduced that, because of certain similarities between different forms of life, there has been an organic evolution from one form to another. ... To me, such theories are unbelievable!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statements from the 1930s Roberts–Smith–Talmage dispute===
In 1930, [[B. H. Roberts]], the presiding member of the [[First Council of the Seventy]], was assigned by the First Presidency to create a study manual for the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] holders of the church.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name = sherlock&gt;Richard Sherlock, [http://content.lib.utah.edu/u?/dialogue,5329 "'We Can See No Advantage to a Continuation of the Discussion': The Roberts/Smith/Talmage Affair,"] ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' '''13'''(3):63–78 (Fall 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Entitled ''The Truth, The Way, The Life'', the draft of the manual that was submitted to the First Presidency and the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] for approval stated that death had been occurring on earth for millions of years prior to the [[Fall of Man|fall of Adam]] and that human-like [[pre-Adamites]] had lived on the earth.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name = MAE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[B. H. Roberts]] ([[John W. Welch]] ed.) (1996, 2d ed.) ''The Way, The Truth, The Life: An Elementary Treatise on Theology'' (Provo Utah: BYU Studies).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April 1930, [[Joseph Fielding Smith]], a junior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the son of [[Joseph F. Smith|a late]] [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]], "vigorously promulgated [the] opposite point of view" in a speech that was published in a church magazine.&lt;ref name = sherlock/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Fielding Smith]], "Faith Leads to a Fulness of Truth and Righteousness", ''Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine'' '''21''':145–158 (October 1930).&lt;/ref&gt; In his widely read speech, Smith taught as doctrine that there had been no death on earth until after the fall of Adam and that there were no "pre-Adamites".&lt;ref name = MAE/&gt;&lt;ref name = sherlock/&gt;

In 1931, both Roberts and Smith were permitted to present their views to the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve.&lt;ref name = sherlock/&gt; After hearing both sides, the First Presidency issued a memo to the general authorities of the church which stated while they agree with the idea that "Adam is the primal parent of our race", there is no advantage to continuing the discussion and that church members should focus on "[bearing] the message of the restored gospel to the people of the world" and that those sciences do not have anything to do with, "the salvation of the souls of mankind". They stated that continuation of the discussion would only lead to "confusion, division, and misunderstanding if continued further."&lt;ref name="Savants"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jefrey|first1=Duane E.|title=Seers, Savants and Evolution: The Uncomfortable Interface|journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|date=Autumn 1973|volume=8|issue=3 &amp; 4|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Dialogue_V08N0304_43.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|64}}&lt;ref&gt;[[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] ([[Heber J. Grant]], [[Anthony W. Ivins]], [[Charles W. Nibley]]), "Memo from the First Presidency to the Council of the Twelve, the First Council of Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric", 1931-04-05; reprinted in William E. Evenson and Duane E. Jeffrey (2005). ''Mormonism and Evolution: The Authoritative LDS Statements'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Greg Kofford Books) pp. 54–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of the apostles, [[geologist]] [[James E. Talmage]], pointed out that Smith's views could be misinterpreted as the church's official position, since Smith's views were widely circulated in a church magazine but Roberts's views were limited to an internal church document.&lt;ref name = MAE/&gt;&lt;ref name = sherlock/&gt; As a result, the First Presidency gave permission to Talmage to give a speech promoting views that were contrary to Smith's.&lt;ref name = MAE/&gt; In his speech on August 9, 1931, in the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]], Talmage taught the same principles that Roberts had originally outlined in his draft manual.&lt;ref&gt;[[James E. Talmage]], "The Earth and Man", ''[[Deseret News]]'', 1931-11-21; reprinted in pamphlet form by the Church in 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; Over Smith's objections, the First Presidency authorized a church publication of Talmage's speech in pamphlet form.&lt;ref name = MAE/&gt; In 1965, Talmage's speech was reprinted again by the Church in an official church magazine.&lt;ref name="earth"&gt;[[James E. Talmage]], "The Earth and Man", ''[[The Instructor|Instructor]]'' '''100''':474–77 (December 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; As Talmage points out in the article, "The outstanding point of difference ... is the point of time which man in some state has lived on this planet." With regards to evolution in general, Talmage challenged many of its aspects in the same speech. He said that he does not believe Adam descended from cavemen or lower forms of men, but is divinely created. He did, however, state that were it true that Adam evolved from lower form, it only seems likely that men will continue to evolve into something higher as a part of eternal progression. He continued by stating that, "evolution is true so far as it means development, and progress, and advancement in all the works of God", and that the scriptures, "should not be discredited by theories of men; they cannot be discredited by fact and truth."&lt;ref name="earth" /&gt; Talmage considered the possibility of pre-Adamites; however, he denied speciation and evolution.&lt;ref name="paul"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paul |first1=Erich Robert |title=Science, Religion, and Mormon Cosmology |date=1992 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0252018958}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|178}}

Roberts died in 1933 and ''The Truth, The Way, The Life'' remained unpublished until 1994, when it was published by an independent publisher.&lt;ref name = Reid/&gt;

Although it is apparent that Roberts and Smith may have had differing views on whether there was death before the fall of Adam, it is evident that they may have had similar views against organic evolution as the explanation for the origin of man. For example, Roberts wrote that "the theory of evolution as advocated by many modern scientists lies stranded upon the shore of idle speculation. There is one other objection to be urged against the theory of evolution before leaving it; it is contrary to the revelations of God."&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Roberts, ''The Gospel and Man's Relationship to Deity'', pp. 265–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts further criticized the theories of evolution by stating that Darwin's claims of evolution are contrary to the experience and knowledge of man, because the law of nature requires that every organism reproduces of its own kind, and while variation may occur, changes usually revert due to extinction, chromosomal infertility, or by reversion to original species.&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Roberts, ''The Gospel and Man's Relationship to Deity'', pp. 279–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joseph Fielding Smith===
In 1954, when he was [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], Smith wrote at length about his personal views on evolution in his book ''Man, His Origin and Destiny'' stating that it was a destructive&lt;ref name="Origin" /&gt;{{rp|280}} and contaminating influence&lt;ref name="Origin" /&gt;{{rp|259}} and that "If the Bible does not kill Evolution, Evolution will kill the Bible."&lt;ref name="Origin"&gt;[[Joseph Fielding Smith]] (1954). ''Man, His Origin and Destiny'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origin" /&gt;{{rp|240}} He further stated that "There is not and cannot be, any compromise between the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the theories of evolution"&lt;ref name="Origin" /&gt;{{rp|184–185}} and that "It is not possible for a logical mind to hold both Bible teaching and evolutionary teaching at the same time"&lt;ref name="Origin" /&gt;{{rp|240}} since "If you accept [the scriptures] you cannot accept organic evolution."&lt;ref name="Origin" /&gt;{{rp|276}} In response to an inquiry about the book from the head of the [[University of Utah]] Geology Department, [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[David O. McKay]] affirmed that "the Church has officially taken no position" on evolution, Smith's book "is not approved by the Church", and that the book is entirely Smith's "views for which he alone is responsible".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[David O. McKay]] to William Lee Stokes, 1957-02-15, reprinted in William Lee Stokes, [http://content.lib.utah.edu/u?/dialogue,2039 "An Official Position"], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' '''12'''(4):90–92 at [http://content.lib.utah.edu/u?/dialogue,2040 p. 91].&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also produced personal statements on evolution in his ''Doctrines of Salvation'' including that "If evolution is true, the church is false" since "If life began on Earth as advocated by Darwin ... then the doctrines of the church are false".&lt;ref name="Doctrines"&gt;{{Citation | editor1-last= McConkie | editor1-first= Bruce R. | editor1-link= Bruce R.

===Bruce R. McConkie===
[[Bruce R. McConkie]] was an influential church leader and author on the topic of evolution having been published several time speaking strongly on the topic. He stated his view in 1982 at BYU that there was no death in the world for Adam or for any form of life before the fall, and that trying to reconcile religion and organic evolution was a false and devilish heresy among church members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marrott|first1=Robert L.|title=The Seven Deadly Heresies (Tape Transcript)|url=http://emp.byui.edu/marrottr/SevenDeadlyAnderson.pdf|website=byui.edu|publisher=Brigham Young University-Idaho|accessdate=15 September 2017|quote=There are those who say that revealed religion and organic evolution can be harmonized.

Smith and entitled The Origin of Man, means anything except exactly what it says. ... that there was no death in the world for him or for any form of life until after the fall .... Try as you may, you cannot harmonize these things with the evolutionary postulate that death has always existed and that the various forms of life have evolved from preceding forms over astronomically long periods of time. Try as you may, you cannot harmonize the theories of men with the inspired word .... If death has always prevailed in the world, there was no fall of Adam that brought death to all forms of life.

==Academic==
The earliest instance in which science and evolution were used to support LDS doctrine occurred in a series of six published articles in 1895, "Theosophy and Mormonism" by Nels L. Nelson. These articles were published in 1904 in ''Scientific Aspects of Mormonism''. Nelson used the ideas of evolution to consider the spiritual and physical development of God and humans. Nelson's view of evolution is spiritual with deliberate use of scientific processes by God rather than as a random, accidental process.&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt;{{rp|24–25}} Mormon philosopher [[William Henry Chamberlin]]'s ''Essay on Nature'' (1915) and [[Frederick J. Pack]]'s ''Science and Belief in God'' (1924) defended the theory of evolution; both attempted to reconcile religion and evolution.&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt;{{rp|26}} In a work, Pack states, "no warfare exists between 'Mormonism' and true science."&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt;{{rp|31}}

==Views in the early 2000s==
There is an ongoing discussion and questioning among members of the LDS Church concerning the religion, evolution, and the reconciliation between the two.&lt;ref name="laird"&gt;{{Cite thesis |url= http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/1400/ |title= Mormon Rhetoric and the Theory of Organic Evolution |last= Laird |first= Kurt Wilford |type= Master Thesis |publisher= Department of English, [[Brigham Young University]] |year= 2008 |oclc= 368066211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} There are a number of current LDS-related publications with articles related to evolution. According to scholar Michael R. Ash, a great number of church members read ''Ensign'' which generally publishes articles with unfavorable views on evolution. Other publications such as ''BYU Studies'', ''FARMS Review of Books'', ''Dialogue'', and ''Sunstone'' represent a pro-evolutionary or neutral stance.&lt;ref name="ash" /&gt;{{rp|37–38}} The official stance of the Church on evolution is neutral. There are many Church members, including scientists who accept evolution as a legitimate scientific theory.&lt;ref name="ash" /&gt;{{rp|19}}

A 2018 study in ''[[PLOS One]]'' researched the attitudes toward evolution of LDS undergraduates. The study revealed that there has been a recent shift of attitude towards evolution among LDS undergraduates. These attitudes have shifted from antagonistic to accepting. The researchers cited examples of more acceptance of fossil and geological records, as well as an acceptance of the old age of the earth. The researchers attributed this attitude change to several factors including primary school exposure to evolution and a reduction in the number of anti-evolution statements from the First Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bradshaw |first1=William S. |last2=Phillips |first2=Andrea J. |last3=Bybee |first3=Seth M. |last4=Gill |first4=Richard A. |last5=Peck |first5=Steven L. |last6=Jensen |first6=Jamie L. |title=A longitudinal study of attitudes toward evolution among undergraduates who are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |journal=PLOS One |date=November 7, 2018 |volume=13 |issue=11 |url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0205798 |accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{John}}

The [[John (given name)|name '''John''']] (in Greek, {{lang|grc|Ἰωάννης}}) is prominent in the [[New Testament]] and occurs numerous times. Among  Jews of this period, the name was one of the most popular, borne by about five percent of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony | last=Bauckham | first=Richard | authorlink=Richard Bauckham | year=2006 | page=416 | isbn=0802831621 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it has long been debated which Johns are to be identified with which.&lt;ref name="Culpepper"&gt;{{cite book | title=John, the Son of Zebedee: The Life of a Legend | year=1994 | at=passim | isbn=0872499626 | last=Culpepper | first=R.

==Mentioned in narrative==

===John, father of Simon Peter===

[[Simon Peter]] is at times called “Simon, son of John”, though in Matthew the text has ''Simon Bariona''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Mt 16:17; Jn 1:42, 21:15–17||!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter appears to be untranslated Aramaic, with ''bar'' meaning “son of” and ''Iona'' being Jonah, or according to Bauckham, ''Jôhana‘'', an Aramaized form of ''John''.{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|p=104}}

===John the Baptist===

{{main|John the Baptist}}

[[John the Baptist]], son of Zechariah, figures prominently in the beginning of each of the four Gospels. The [[Synoptic Gospels]] distinguish him as “the Baptist”, but the [[Gospel of John]] omits this epithet, as no other John is therein mentioned by name. John the Baptist was [[Beheading of St. John the Baptist|beheaded]] during the ministry of Jesus, so in most cases he is easily distinguished from other Johns.

Ford proposes that [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] originated as prophecy of John the Baptist, expanded by his followers to produce the book in its current form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Revelation | year=1975 | pages=28–37 | isbn=0385008953 | series=The Anchor Bible | volume=38 | last=Ford | first=J. Massyngberde | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most scholars reject this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b1lDcUkB4GUC&amp;pg=PA26 | title=The Genre of the Book of Revelation from a Source-critical Perspective | year=1989 | pages=26–29 | isbn=3110115182 | series=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift für die neutestamentliche Wissenschaft und die Kunde der älteren Kirche | volume=54 | last=Mazzaferri | first=Frederick David | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John the Apostle===

{{main|John the Apostle}}

[[John the Apostle|John, son of Zebedee]] was one of the [[Twelve Apostles]], along with his brother [[James, son of Zebedee|James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Mt 10:2; Mk 3:17; Lk 6:14; Acts 1:13||!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This John is mentioned frequently in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], but always (with a lone exception&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Mk 9:38; Lk 9:49||!}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) in company with his brother James&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Mt 4:21; Mk 1:19; Lk 5:10||!}}; {{bibleref2|Mk 1:29||!}}; {{bibleref2|Lk 9:54||!}}; {{bibleref2|Mt 20:20–24; Mk 10:35–41||!}}; {{bibleref2|Mt 27:56||!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or with [[Saint Peter|Peter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Lk 22:8||!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or often with both.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Mt 17:1; Mk 9:2; Lk 9:28||!}}; {{bibleref2|Mk 5:37; Lk 8:51||!}}; {{bibleref2|Mk 13:3||!}}; {{bibleref2|Mt 26:37; Mk 14:33||!}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first eight chapters of [[Acts]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] is always accompanied by a certain John,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|3:1–11, 4:1–22, 8:14|!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who is almost certainly his fellow apostle, and is presumably also the John that Paul elsewhere lists with Peter and James as “pillars”.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Gal|2:9|!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But after the execution of his brother James&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|12:2|!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in 44, this John is never again mentioned.

There are many early indications that James and John were killed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/MN41506ucmf_0 | title=The Enigma of the Fourth Gospel: Its Author and Writer | authorlink=Robert Eisler | year=1938 | pages=58 ff. | last=Eisler | first=Robert | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Culpepper|1994|pp=171–174}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Le martyre de Jean l’apôtre | authorlink=Marie-Émile Boismard | year=1996 | isbn=2850210862 | last=Boismard | first=Marie-Émile | ref=harv | series=Cahiers de la Revue biblique | volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response of Jesus to these two, “The cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized,”&lt;ref name="martyrdom"&gt;{{bibleref2|Mk 10:35–40; Mt 20:20–23||!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has been understood since antiquity as foretelling their [[martyrdom]]. Indeed, [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] (c. 100) records that James and John “were killed by the Jews”,&lt;ref&gt;This point, however, is preserved only in [http://www.chronicon.net/index.php/papias#Philip%20of%20Side Philip of Side] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910155741/http://www.chronicon.net/index.php/papias#Philip%20of%20Side |date=2014-09-10 }} (c. 435) and in an interpolation in the [http://www.chronicon.net/index.php/papias#George%20Hamartolus ''Chronicology of George Hamartolus''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910155741/http://www.chronicon.net/index.php/papias#George%20Hamartolus |date=2014-09-10 }} (c. 860).&lt;/ref&gt; and early martyrologies record the martyrdom of “John and James the apostles in Jerusalem”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=3153028 | title=The Martyrdom of St. John | journal=The American Journal of Theology |date=Oct 1899 | volume=3 | issue=4 | pages=729–740 | last=Badham | first=Francis Pritchett | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=3153885 | title=The Martyrdom of John the Apostle | journal=The American Journal of Theology |date=Jul 1904 | volume=8 | issue=3 | pages=539–554 | last=Badham | first=Francis Pritchett | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, many ancient sources and many modern scholars identify John the Apostle as the author of some or all of the Johannine books, thereby claiming [[Apostle (Christian)|apostolic]] authority for them. Thus, John the Apostle is identified with [[John the Evangelist]], probably also [[John the Elder]], and, with still less certainty, [[John the Revelator]], and also with the John who survived to old age in Ephesus.

===John of the high-priestly family===

This John is mentioned once in passing as present during the trial of Peter and John in Jerusalem, as recorded in [[Acts]]: “On the next day, their rulers, elders, and experts in the law came together in Jerusalem. [[Annas]] the high priest was there, and [[Caiaphas]], John, Alexander, and others who were members of the high priest’s family.”&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|4:5–7|!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he is probably distinct from John the Apostle, although some scholars (including the 5th Century writer Nonnus, as well as the [[Gospel of the Nazarenes]]) have suggested that the Zebedees' fishing business made them known to the high priest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Culpepper|first1=R. Alan|title=John, the Son of Zebedee: The Life of a Legend|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press.|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others conclude that being fishermen (owning multiple boats) is not synonymous with being poor nor precludes priestly connections, and some argue that the other disciple who was known to the high priest and who ''spoke to the servant-girl on duty there and brought Peter'' in mentioned in John 18:15 is likely to be the same disciple who is never mentioned by name in John's Gospel. However, the Sons of Zebedee are both present in chapter 21 in the count of five plus two (where seven is the 'complete' number) unnamed disciples.  The Beloved Disciple is named as such separately; the other is likely Andrew.  Which would be the reverse of the first followers identified in chapter 1.

[[Polycrates of Ephesus]] (c. 190) writes that John the Evangelist “was a priest, wearing the [[tzitz|petalon]]”&lt;ref name="Polycrates"&gt;Polycrates, ''Ep. ad Vict.'', apud Eusebius, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.x.xxv.html ''Hist. Eccl.'' 5.24].1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;—i.e., specifically that he had served as [[High Priest (Judaism)|High Priest]].{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|p=447}} In this, he seems to identify the Evangelist with this high-priestly John mentioned in Acts.{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|pp=438–452}} Some modern scholars make the same identification,{{sfnp|Eisler|1938|pp=36–45}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=L’‘apostolo ed evangelista Giovanni,’ ‘sacerdoto’ levitico | journal=Revista Biblica | year=1990 | volume=38 | issue=4 | pages=451–483 | last=Rigato | first=Maria-Luisa | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; further citing from the Gospel “the other disciple, who was known to the High Priest.”&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Jn|18:15–16|!}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is no conclusive proof, and early writings such as by Polycrates may be interpretations based on their reading of the gospels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Culpepper|first1=R. Alan|title=John, the Son of Zebedee: The Life of a Legend|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press.|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are many theories - as one example: given that Elizabeth, Mary's kinswoman, was a "Daughter of Aaron" (and so had priestly connections), so too would Mary's sister mentioned in John 19:25...  and she is mentioned in a way, some suggest, that might indicate she is John's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Leon|title=The Gospel According to John (The New International Commentary on the New Testament)|date=1995|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.|page=666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Mark===

{{main|John Mark}}

“[[John Mark|John, called Mark]]” is mentioned several times in Acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|12:12, 12:25, 13:5, 13:13, 15:37|!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such use of one Semitic name and another Greek name was a common practice among Jews of the time.{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|p=83}} He is usually identified with the Mark mentioned in various epistles,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Pet 5:13; Col 4:10; 2 Tim 4:11; Phil 1:24||!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Mark the Evangelist]].

This John is occasionally proposed as author of some of the Johannine works as well.{{sfnp|Culpepper|1994|pp=107–108}}&lt;ref name="Dionysius"&gt;Dionysius of Alexandria, ''On the Promises'' 2, apud Eusebius, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xii.xxvi.html ''Hist. Eccl.'' 7.25].&lt;/ref&gt; Tarazi even goes so far as to attribute to him the Gospels of both [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and [[Gospel of John|John]] and all the other Johannine books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLkVKM_4UWEC&amp;pg=PA13 | title=Johannine Writings | year=2004 | pages=13–17 | isbn=0881412643 | last=Tarazi | first=Paul Nadim | ref=harv | volume=3 | series=The New Testament: An Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Johannine literature==

[[File:JohnEvangelistReni.jpg|right|thumb|Guido Reni, ''St. John the Evangelist'', 17th century.]]

{{main|Authorship of the Johannine works}}

Five canonical books of the New Testament are ascribed to John and thus called collectively the ''[[Johannine literature]]'':
* The [[Gospel of John]]
* The [[First Epistle of John]]
* The [[Second Epistle of John]]
* The [[Third Epistle of John]]
* The [[Book of Revelation]]

Only in Revelation does the text itself name its author as John;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Rev|1:1–4, 1:9, 22:8|!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the other Johannine works are ascribed to John only through their attached titles and other external references.

Whether or not these attributions have a basis in historical truth—modern scholars vary widely in their opinions about authorship—the question remains of which John each of these attributions refers to. Since antiquity, many have considered the entire Johannine corpus to be the work of a single author, a certain John of Ephesus, whom many identified with the [[John the Apostle|Apostle John, son of Zebedee]]. On the other hand, this identification and the authorship of individual works have also been disputed since antiquity. Thus, the reputed authors of the Johannine works are conventionally called more explicitly—without prejudice to the issues of actual authorship and of their mutual identification—as follows.

===John the Evangelist===

{{main|John the Evangelist}}

The author of the [[Gospel of John|Gospel]] is termed [[John the Evangelist]].

In the Gospel, the name ''John'' occurs exclusively in reference to [[John the Baptist]], and without that epithet, though “the sons of Zebedee”&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Jn|21:2|!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (named James and John in the [[Synoptic Gospels|Synoptics]]) are also mentioned once. The Gospel even lacks a list of the [[Twelve Apostles]].

The anonymous “[[disciple whom Jesus loved]]” is identified in the closing verses as the one whose testimony the Gospel bears: “This is the disciple who testifies about these things and has written these things.”&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Jn|21:20–24|!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient sources invariably identify this disciple with the Evangelist, and many modern scholars agree, though others consider that John the Evangelist fashioned the testimony of the Beloved Disciple into a Gospel, as [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] did for [[Saint Peter|Peter]], or hold on other grounds that the two are not identical.

Further identification of the Beloved Disciple and/or the Evangelist with John the Apostle has been variously defended and impugned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=John the Son of Zebedee and the Fourth Gospel | journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |date=Mar 1962 | volume=81 | issue=1 | pages=35–43 | doi=10.2307/3264824 | jstor=3264824 | last=Parker | first=Pierson | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars see the Gospel's “and we know that his testimony is true,”&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Jn|21:24|!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as indicating a second hand, of a hypothetical “[[John the Redactor]]” or some group of elders certifying the work.{{sfnp|Culpepper|1994|p=94}} Bauckham, however, argues that this is simply the “''we'' of authoritative testimony” of the author himself, used also in the Epistles.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|3 Jn|1:9–12|!}}; {{bibleref2|1 Jn|1:1–5, 4:11–16|!}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|pp=369–383}}

As was an ordinary practice of the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Encountering the Manuscripts: An Introduction to New Testament Paleography &amp; Textual Criticism | year=2005 | pages=4–9 | isbn=0805431454 | last=Comfort | first=Philip | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|p=359}} the Evangelist may have employed an [[amanuensis]]. Apocryphal sources of about the 5th century variously name [[Prochorus]],{{sfnp|Culpepper|1994|pp=269–270|ps=, from the [[Acts of John|Acts of John of Prochorus]].}} [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]],{{sfnp|Culpepper|1994|pp=359|ps=, from the [[Acts of Timothy]].}} or even [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]],{{sfnp|Culpepper|1994|pp=165–167|ps=, from the Anti-Marcionite prologues.}} and modern scholars have suggested others.{{sfnp|Eisler|1938|pp=178–184}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/bsac/1905_484.pdf | title=The Hand of Apollos in the Fourth Gospel | journal=Bibliotheca Sacra | year=1905 | volume=62 | pages=484–99 | last=Rollins | first=George S. | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John the Elder===

{{main|John the Elder}}

The short [[Second Epistle of John|second]] and [[Third Epistle of John|third]] epistles are addressed “From the Elder”.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|2 Jn 1:1; 3 Jn 1:1||!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, the author is termed [[John the Elder]] or John the Presbyter (''presbyter'' being Greek for ''elder'').

[[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] (c. 100) refers to a certain “John the Elder, a disciple of the Lord”, one of the “elders” he had listened to, and from whose sayings he drew in his five-book ''Exegesis'', now lost. Papias goes on to refer to him simply as “the Elder”. Most see Papias as referring to the same John, at least, who penned the epistles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Johannine Question | authorlink=Martin Hengel | year=1989 | pages=24–45 | isbn=033400795X | last=Hengel | first=Martin | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later centuries, some saw the address from “the Elder” in the second and third epistles as possibly indicating a different author than the other Johannine works, which cast doubt on their apostolic authority and therefore on their [[New Testament canon|canonicity]].&lt;ref&gt;Origen, apud Eusebius, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.xxv.html ''Hist. Eccl.'' 6.25].10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.viii.xxv.html ''Hist. Eccl.'' 3.25].3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf203.v.iii.xx.html ''De Vir. Illustr.'' 18].&lt;/ref&gt;

===John the Revelator===

[[File:Seven churches of asia.svg|right|thumb|Patmos and the seven churches of Asia.]]

{{main|John of Patmos }}

The author of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] is variously termed John the Revelator, John the Divine, John the Theologian, or [[John of Patmos]].

The text of Revelation identifies its author thus: “I, John, your brother and the one who shares with you in the persecution, kingdom, and endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called [[Patmos]] because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus.”&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Rev|1:9|NET}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Patmos was an island near [[Ephesus]], and Revelation begins with letters addressed to the [[seven churches of Asia]], which were Ephesus and other nearby cities.

[[Dionysius of Alexandria]] (c. 250) closely criticized Revelation and concluded that it was starkly different from the Gospel and First Epistle (which Dionysius regarded as both the work of John the Apostle) in grammar, style, content, and anonymity, and thus could hardly be the work of the same author, but must have been written by another John, for “there are two monuments in Ephesus, each bearing the name of John.”&lt;ref name="Dionysius"/&gt; Many modern scholars have concurred with this analysis, but others find striking similarities on closer inspection and attribute the stylistic differences to the Evangelist's use of an [[amanuensis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Book of Revelation: An Introduction and Commentary | authorlink=Leon Morris | year=1987 | pages=27–34 | isbn=0802802737 | last=Morris | first=Leon | ref=harv | series=Tyndale New Testament Commentaries | volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Culpepper|1994|pp=130–134}}

The ancient scholars who accepted Revelation as authentic, however, invariably identified its author as John the Evangelist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Patmos in the Reception History of the Apocalypse | year=2013 | pages=28 ff. | isbn=0199674205 | last=Boxall | first=Ian | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our earliest and most reliable informant is [[Irenaeus]] (c. 180), who knew John's personal disciples while in [[Smyrna]]. Irenaeus firmly identifies the Revelator with the Evangelist&lt;ref name="Irenaeus-authors"&gt;Irenaeus, ''Adv. Haer.'' [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iv.xvii.html 3.16].5, 8; [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vi.xxi.html 4.20].11.&lt;/ref&gt; and tells us that he remained with the Church in Ephesus until the time of [[Trajan]] (98–117).&lt;ref name="Irenaeus-Trajan"&gt;Irenaeus, [http://www.hypotyposeis.org/synoptic-problem/2004/11/external-evidence-irenaeus.html ''Adv. Haer.'' 2.22.5, 3.3.4].&lt;/ref&gt; The Revelator was still publicly active until the close of [[Domitian]]’s reign (81–96), as Irenaeus says:&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vii.xxxi.html ''Adv. Haer.'' 5.30].3.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|For if it were necessary that the [[Antichrist]]’s name should be distinctly revealed in this present time, it would have been announced by him who beheld the apocalyptic vision. For he {{bracket|or ''it''?}} was seen no very long time since, but almost in our day, towards the end of Domitian’s reign.}}

From Irenaeus’ ambiguous syntax, some later writers inferred that the exile to Patmos occurred under Domitian, though others explicitly ascribed it to [[Nero]] (54–68); modern scholars still debate which is more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.preteristarchive.com/Books/pdf/1989_gentry_before-jerusalem-fell.pdf | title=Before Jerusalem Fell | authorlink=Kenneth Gentry | year=1989 | pages=45–67 | isbn=0930464206 | last=Gentry | first=Kenneth L. | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clement of Alexandria]], a contemporary of Irenaeus, tells an anecdote of John and the young robber captain, which opens with:&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.vi.v.html ''Quis dives salvetur''] 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|When, on the tyrant’s death, he returned to Ephesus from the isle of Patmos, he went away, being invited, to the contiguous territories of the nations, here to appoint bishops, there to set in order whole Churches, there to ordain such as were marked out by the Spirit.}}

So again the Revelator is identified with the Bishop of Ephesus, about whom ancient sources have much to say.

==John of Ephesus==

Patristic sources from as early as the 2nd century widely attest to a certain John, a disciple of Jesus, who lived to old age in [[Ephesus]], and to whom all the Johannine works are ascribed.{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|pp=438, 453}}

Whether such a man existed, which works he wrote, whether this figure has been confused or conflated with a second John, and whether he is identical with John son of Zebedee or any other John in the New Testament are all matters of intense controversy.&lt;ref name="Culpepper" /&gt;

[[File:Christ and St. John (Boston Public Library).jpg|right|thumb|Ary Scheffer, ''Christ and St. John'', 19th century]]

[[Irenaeus]] (c. 180), who cites from [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] and “the elders” and also personally knew [[Polycarp of Smyrna]], another disciple of John of Ephesus, is widely considered the most reliable authority we have on this John. In our first extant description of all four Gospels, Irenaeus concludes:&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, [http://www.hypotyposeis.org/synoptic-problem/2004/11/external-evidence-irenaeus.html ''Adv. Haer.'' 3.1.1].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Finally John, the disciple of the Lord, who had lain on his breast,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Jn|13:25, 21:20|!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; himself also published a Gospel, while he was residing at Ephesus of Asia.}}

Here, John the Evangelist is clearly identified with the [[Beloved Disciple]] and located in Ephesus. Elsewhere Irenaeus unmistakably cites this same John as author of the Epistles and Revelation as well.&lt;ref name="Irenaeus-authors"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Johannine Corpus in the Early Church | year=2004 | pages=97–101 | isbn=0199264589 | last=Hill | first=Charles E. | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus also speaks of the aged John surviving in Ephesus until the time of [[Trajan]] (98–117),&lt;ref name="Irenaeus-Trajan"/&gt; which would be about 70 years after the [[Crucifixion of Jesus#Chronology of the crucifixion|Crucifixion]].

[[Polycrates of Ephesus]] (c. 190) is another especially respected source on John, writing of his own relative and predecessor (following the [[Philip the Apostle]]):&lt;ref name="Polycrates"/&gt;

{{quotation|There is John also, he who leaned back on the Lord’s breast, who was a priest wearing the [[tzitz|petalon]], both witness and teacher. He has fallen asleep at Ephesus.}}

Polycrates is in accord with Irenaeus, but seems to additionally identify John with the high-priestly John in Acts.{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|pp=438–452}}

The earliest evidence on the identity of this John is from [[Papias of Hierapolis]], a “hearer of John”&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103533.htm ''Adv. Haer.'' 5.33].4.&lt;/ref&gt; writing c. 100,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/26/26-2/26-2-pp181-191_JETS.pdf | title=The Date of Papias: A Reassessment | last=Yarbrough | first=Robert W. | journal=Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society |date=Jun 1983 | volume=26 | issue=2 | pages=181–191 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose work survives only in fragments quoted by others. Papias writes:&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.viii.xxxix.html ''Hist. Eccl.'' 3.39].4. Translation from {{harvtxt|Bauckham|2006}}, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|And if by chance anyone who had been in attendance on the elders should come my way, I inquired about the words of the elders—what Andrew or Peter had said, or Philip, or Thomas or James, or John or Matthew or any other of the Lord’s disciples, and whatever Aristion and the elder John, the Lord’s disciples, were saying.}}

So, Papias refers first to John the Apostle, listed with his brother and others of the Twelve, whose words the elders had handed down to him, and then to John the Elder, another disciple of Jesus, who was himself still being heard. Though some have interpreted these as two references to the same John,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=John: Evangelist and Interpreter | authorlink=Stephen Smalley | year=1978 | pages=73–74 | isbn=0853642141 | last=Smalley | first=Stephen Stewart | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauckham argues that Papias is clearly distinguishing them.{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|pp=412–437}} Papias then goes on to cite “the Elder” (just as the Second and Third Epistles are addressed from) on the origins of the Gospels of Mark and Matthew at least,&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.viii.xxxix.html ''Hist. Eccl.'' 3.39].15.&lt;/ref&gt; and also to cite from the First Epistle and Revelation.

Papias’ account of the origin of the Gospel of John is apparently paraphrased and expanded by Eusebius&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.viii.xxiv.html ''Hist. Eccl.'' 3.24].5–13.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|pp=433–437}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=What Papias Said About John (and Luke): A ‘New’ Papian Fragment | journal=Journal of Theological Studies | year=1998 | volume=49 | issue=2 | pages=582–629 | doi=10.1093/jts/49.2.582 | last=Hill | first=Charles E. | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is most likely the source for the [[Muratorian Canon]] (c. 170) when it says:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronicon.net/index.php/papias#Hypothetical%20Fragments Papias: Hypothetical Fragments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910155741/http://www.chronicon.net/index.php/papias |date=2014-09-10 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|pp=425–432}}

{{quotation|The fourth of the gospels is of John, one of the disciples. To his fellow-disciples and bishops, who were encouraging him, he said: “Fast with me today for three days, and whatever will be revealed to each of us, let us tell to one another.” The same night it was revealed to [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]], one of the apostles, that all should certify what John wrote in his own name.… Why, then, is it remarkable that John so constantly brings forth single points even in his epistles, saying of himself, “What we have seen with our eyes and heard with our ears and our hands have handled, these we write to you”?&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 John|1:1, 4|!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus he professes himself not only an eyewitness and hearer but also a writer of all the miracles of our Lord in order.}}

The ''[[Acts of John]]'', an apocryphal [[Christian Gnosticism|Gnostic]] work thought to have been composed around the late 2nd century, paints a rich, full narrative about John that was profoundly influential on later sources. Here we find the first explicit identification with the son of Zebedee, the story of the attempted [[death by boiling|execution by boiling oil]] also reported by [[Tertullian]],&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.v.iii.xxxvi.html ''De Praes. Haer.'' 36].&lt;/ref&gt; the manner of John's natural death, and a great deal more.{{sfnp|Culpepper|1994|pp=232–251}} From the 3rd century onward, legends about John abound, with little hope of untangling any truth from the fiction.

It is clear that John of Ephesus was regarded from the earliest times as a personal disciple of Jesus and a crucial witness to his life, an author of scripture, an apostle, and a great leader among the churches of Asia; whether he was also the son of Zebedee, one of the Twelve Apostles, is much more doubtful. No such identification is explicit in the early sources, apart from the clearly apocryphal, until the middle of the 3rd century. At most, John of Ephesus is occasionally called ''apostle'', but in those cases the term is certainly not confined to the Twelve, and when mentioned with one of the Twelve Apostles, the Evangelist is in fact usually called a ''disciple'' by contrast.{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|pp=458–463}} Bauckham argues that Papias distinguishes them and that the words of Polycrates even preclude such identification,{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|pp=444–452}} and echos of this distinction linger in a few later sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.earlychurch.org.uk/pdf/evangelist_bruce.pdf | title=Some Notes on the Fourth Evangelist | journal=The Evangelical Quarterly | year=1944 | volume=16 | pages=101–109 | last=Bruce | first=F. F. | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the orthodox, [[Origen]] is the first to explicitly accept the identification,{{sfnp|Culpepper|1994|p=358}} which requires him to reconcile the tradition of John's natural death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Polycarp and John: The Harris Fragments and Their Challenge to the Literary Tradition | year=1999 | pages=134–135 | isbn=0268038511 | last=Weidmann | first=Frederick W. | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Comm. in Matt.'' 20.23, apud {{harvtxt|Culpepper|1994}}, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; with the prophecy of John's martyrdom&lt;ref name="martyrdom"/&gt; by seeing the latter fulfilled in his temporary exile to Patmos.&lt;ref&gt;Origen, ''In Matt.'' 16.6, apud {{harvtxt|Boxall|2013}}, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, after this point the identification was almost universally accepted in antiquity.{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|p=452}}

On whether or not John of Ephesus is to be identified with any of the Johns in the New Testament narrative—the son of Zebedee, the high-priestly John, or even John Mark—modern scholars remain divided.&lt;ref name="Culpepper" /&gt;

''The Cambridge companion to Renaissance philosophy''. p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; – October 31, 1499, in [[Vicenza]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Averroist]] philosopher, at the [[University of Padua]].&lt;ref&gt; http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-influence/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He studied at [[Pavia]], under [[Paolo da Pergola]] in [[Venice]], and with [[Gaetano da Thiene (philosopher)|Gaetano da Thiene]] in Padua, graduating with a doctorate in 1458. His first work was on the ''[[unitas intellectus]]'', the theory of Averroes on the unity of the [[soul]] and [[intellect]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt and Skinner, p. 839.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[natural philosophy]] he posed the question of the scope of the subject. Following Averroes, he took “mobile being” as the topic, against the scholastic views of [[Antonius Andreas]] and [[John Canonicus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Craig (philosopher)|Edward Craig]], ed., ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1998), p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pietro Barozzi]], [[Bishop of Padua]], in 1489 issued a decree limiting academic discussion, and Vernia had to withdraw from his position. He wrote against Averroes, in ''Contra perversam Averrois opinionem'', attacking his views on the [[immortality of the soul]] and the unity of the intellect.&lt;ref&gt;Deno John Geanakoplos, ''Constantinople and the West: Essays on the Late Byzantine (Palaeologan) and Italian Renaissances and the Byzantine and Roman Churches'' (1989), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

His students included [[Agostino Nifo]] and [[Pietro Pomponazzi]]. Both Vernia and Nifo changed allegiance from Averroes to the interpretations of [[Aristotle]] in certain Greek commentators, one of whom, [[Themistius]], was being translated by [[Ermolao Barbaro]], a colleague at Padua. As time went on, the commentary ''On the Soul'' by [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] was translated into Latin, by [[Girolamo Donato]], and a translation of the commentary attributed to [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] was also circulated. Vernia's views of the correct interpretation of Aristotle modified in the light of access to these fresh opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton and Nancy Siraisi (editors), Introduction p. 9, in ''Natural Particulars: Nature and the Disciplines in Renaissance Europe'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Craig, ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1998), p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pomponazzi/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8913">The '''paradox of the pesticides''' is a [[paradox]] that states that applying [[pesticide]] to a [[pest (organism)|pest]] may end up increasing the [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]] of the pest if the pesticide upsets natural predator–prey dynamics in the ecosystem.

== Lotka–Volterra equation ==
To describe the paradox of the pesticides mathematically, the [[Lotka–Volterra equation]], a set of first-order, nonlinear, [[differential equations]], which are frequently used to describe predator–prey interactions, can be modified to account for the additions of pesticides into the predator–prey interactions.

=== Without pesticides ===
The variables represent the following:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H &amp; = \text{the prey population at a given time} \\
P &amp; = \text{the predator population at a given time} \\
c &amp; = \text{the capture constant} \\
r &amp; = \text{the rate of growth of the prey population} \\
a &amp; = \text{the fraction of prey energy assimilated by the predator and turned into new predators} \\
m &amp; = \text{predator mortality rate} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The following two equations are the original [[Lotka–Volterra equation]], which describe the rate of change of each respective population as a function of the population of the other organism:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{dH}{dt} &amp; = rH - cHP \\
\frac{dP}{dt} &amp; = acHP - mP \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

By setting each equation to zero and thus assuming a stable population, a graph of two lines ([[isocline]]s) can be made to find the equilibrium point, the point at which both interacting populations are stable.

These are the isoclines for the two above equations:

: &lt;math&gt; P=\frac{r}{c} \quad \text{and} \quad H=\frac{m}{ac}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Accounting for pesticides ===

[[File:Isoclines-2.png|thumb|right|300px|Predator–prey isoclines before and after pesticide application. Pest abundance has increased.]]

Now, to account for the difference in the population dynamics of the predator and prey that occurs with the addition of pesticides, variable ''q'' is added to represent the per capita rate at which both species are killed by the pesticide. The original Lotka–Volterra equations change to be as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{dH}{dt} &amp; = H(r-cP-q) \\
\frac{dP}{dt} &amp; = P(acH-m-q) \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving the isoclines as was done above, the following equations represent the two lines with the intersection that represents the new equilibrium point. These are the new isoclines for the populations:

: &lt;math&gt; P=\frac{r-q}{c} \quad \text{and} \quad H=\frac{m+q}{ac}&lt;/math&gt;

As one can see from the new isoclines, the new equilibrium will have a higher H value and a lower P value so the number of prey will increase while the number of predator decreases. Thus, prey, which is normally the targeted by the pesticide, is actually being benefited instead of harmed by the pesticide.

A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator–prey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or [[Arditi–Ginzburg equations|Arditi–Ginzburg model]].&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. 1989. [http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/ginzburglab/Coupling%20in%20Predator-Prey%20Dynamics%20-%20Arditi%20and%20Ginzburg,%201989.pdf Coupling in predator–prey dynamics: ratio dependence]. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' 139: 311-326.&lt;/ref&gt; The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models. According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong. They are much closer to the ratio-dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed, one can use the Arditi–Ginzburg model as the first approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. 2012. ''How Species Interact: Altering the Standard View on Trophic Ecology''. Oxford University Press, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empirical evidence ==

The paradox has been documented repeatedly throughout the history of pest management. Predatory [[mites]], for example, naturally prey upon [[phytophagous]] mites, which are common pests in apple orchards. Spraying the orchards kills both mites, but the effect of diminished predation is larger than that of the pesticide, and phytophagous mites increase in abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect has also been seen on rice, as documented by the [[International Rice Research Institute]], which noted significant declines in pest populations when they stopped applying pesticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Recent studies suggest that such a paradox might not be necessarily caused by the reduction of the predator population by harvesting itself, for example, by a pesticide. The host population is reduced at the moment of harvesting, and simultaneously, the intraspecific density effect is weakened.&lt;ref name="Matsuoka, T. 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Matsuoka | first1 = T. | last2 = Seno | first2 = H. | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.01.024 | title = Ecological balance in the native population dynamics may cause the paradox of pest control with harvesting | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 252 | issue = 1 | pages = 87–97 | year = 2008 | pmid =  
18329048| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intraspecific competition]] accounts for the competition between individuals of a same species. When the population density is high and resources are consequently relatively scarce, each individual has less access to resources to invest energy in growth, survivorship and reproduction. That causes a decrease in the survival rate or an increase in mortality.

Intraspecific competition increases with density. One could expect that a population decrease (due to harvesting, for example) will decrease the population density and reduce intraspecific competition, which would lead to a lower death rate among the prey population.

Studies show also that direct effects on the predator population, through harvesting of the prey, are not necessary to observe the paradox.&lt;ref name="Matsuoka, T. 2008"/&gt; Harvesting of prey has been shown to trigger a reduction in the predator’s reproduction rate, which lowers the equilibrium predator level. Thus, changes in [[Biological life cycle|life history]] strategy (patterns of growth, reproduction and survivorship) can also contribute to the paradox. 
 
Seemingly the paradox can be accounted for by the indirect effects of harvesting on the native ecological interactions of prey and predator: reduction of intraspecific density effect for the prey and reduction of the reproductive rate for the predator. The former increases the population recovery of the prey, and the latter decreases the equilibrium population level for the predator.

== Solutions ==

To deal with the paradox, growers may turn to [[integrated pest management]] (IPM),&lt;ref&gt;"Michigan Tech Blog: 6 Advantages of Integrated Pest Management" https://hub.sfi.mtu.edu/members/3137/blog/2015/Jan/5-advantages-of-integrated-pest-management&lt;/ref&gt; an ecological approach to pest control that accounts for the interactions between pests and their environment.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. “Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles,” http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/factsheets/ipm.htm (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; There is not only one way to practice IPM, but some methods include using mechanical trapping devices or increasing the abundance of natural predators.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. “Pesticides and Food: What ‘Integrated Pest Management’ Means,” http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/food/ipm.htm (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

IPM is also often touted for its environmental and health benefits, as it avoids the use of chemical pesticides.

The '''''Proceedings of the American Catholic Philosophical Association''''' is an annual series containing papers presented at the meetings of the [[American Catholic Philosophical Association]]. Each year the association sponsors a conference organized around a particular philosophical topic and all papers presented at the main sessions (as opposed to satellite sessions) are published the following year in the ''Proceedings''. Each volume is an edited anthology and the secretary of the association serves as [[editor-in-chief]]. All papers presented at the conference are subject to peer review, although the acceptance rate varies depending on the number of papers submitted. The series is published on behalf of the association by the [[Philosophy Documentation Center]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5297">'''Regina Becker-Schmidt'''  is an emeritus [[professor]] at the Institute of Sociology and Social Psychology at the [[University of Hanover]]. Her research focuses on corporate and subject theory, [[critical theory]], psychoanalytically oriented social psychology and [[gender studies]].  She is considered a seminal figure in feminist critical theory.

==Work==
Starting in 1957, Becker-Schmidt studied [[sociology]], [[philosophy]], [[economics]] and [[social psychology]] at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]] and at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris. From 1964 to 1972 she worked as a research assistant and from 1968 as an assistant professor at the [[Institute for Social Research]]  in Frankfurt am Main, where she taught as a lecturer at the Social Sciences Faculty of the University. In 1973 she was appointed to a professorship at the [[University of Hanover]] at the Psychological Institute, the post she held until her retirement in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Muharrem Acikgöz: ''Die Permanenz der kritischen Theorie: die zweite Generation als zerstrittene Interpretationsgemeinschaft'', Münster 2014, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, Becker-Schmidt influenced the development of feminist [[critical theory]], especially in the German-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Gudrun-Axeli Knapp: ''Kritische Theorie. Ein selbstreflexives Denken in Vermittlungen'', in: Becker/Kortendiek 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Her approach is associated with the so-called Hanoverian approach in feminist-oriented sociology and has had decisive influence on the approach.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cf. Muharrem Acikgöz: ''Die Permanenz der kritischen Theorie: die zweite Generation als zerstrittene Interpretationsgemeinschaft'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

She critiqued the positions of critical theory, especially [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], with regard to their ambivalent attitude to the complex of gender relations and how the critical theorists have been oblivious to feminism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; She questioned how gender relations could be made an integral part of critical theory.&lt;ref name="umrath" /&gt; Muharrem Acikgöz situates Regina Becker-Schmidt in the second generation of the [[Frankfurt School]]; she was a student of Adorno's.&lt;ref name="umrath"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Umrath|first1=Barbara|title=Feminist Critical Theory in the Tradition of the Early Frankfurt School: The Significance of Regina Becker-Schmidt|url=http://canononline.org/archives/spring-2010/feminist-critical-theory/|website=The Interdisciplinary Journal of The New School for Social Research|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She distinguishes herself from other feminist critical theorists in her empirical orientation, following [[Max Horkheimer]], who argued that "larger philosophical questions" guide empirical research; and empirical research, in turn, guides larger philosophical questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dialectic of Enlightenment|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l-75zLjGlZQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dialectic+of+enlightenment&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHm4S8n8PJAhUBUj4KHYpLBusQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dialectic%2520of%2520enlightenment&amp;f=false|publisher = Stanford University Press|date = 2002-01-01|isbn = 9780804736336|first = Max|last = Horkheimer|first2 = Theodor W.|last2 = Adorno|first3 = Gunzelin|last3 = Noeri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research on female factory workers situates itself in this relation.&lt;ref name="umrath" /&gt;

Becker-Schmidt conducted empirical research on female factory workers, developing her own [[social theory]] based on her findings. Her first project was entitled "Problems of Mothers who are Wage Laborers", and consisted of interviews with sixty factory workers, half who were still working and half who had withdrawn from factory work. Her research shed tight on the "double burden" faced by women factory workers: the responsibility for domestic work combined with the responsibility for contributing to the income of the family.&lt;ref name="umrath" /&gt; She developed the concept of ''double socialization'' of women through wage labour and domestic work: the two spheres come from two different social realms with different logics, and are both separated and connected.&lt;ref name="umrath" /&gt; Her research focused on both the objective demands of work, and the subjective realities of the worker. In each setting, time itself functions differently: in the factory, women must not lose time; while when taking care of children, women must forget about time, other than in remembering to get housework done before work the next day. The two realms are recombined through relationships (assumed to be heterosexual) and in the efforts of women to "have both" career and family life.

The relationship between '''religion and [[HIV/AIDS]]''' is complicated, and often controversial. Controversies have mainly revolved around [[LGBT]] people and [[condom]] use.

==Religious attitudes towards HIV-positive people and AIDS==
===Islam===

The question of Islam and [[AIDS]] has arisen in recent years as the [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic has grown stronger, with awareness and efforts to prevent the spread of the disease.&lt;ref name="Tackling AIDS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1157962465531&amp;pagename=Zone-English-HealthScience%2FHSELayout |title=Tackling AIDS Through Islam? |author=Najma Mohamed |work=Islam Online |accessdate=26 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529085511/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1157962465531&amp;pagename=Zone-English-HealthScience%2FHSELayout |archivedate=May 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Muslims view the AIDS epidemic through what is called the “prism of sin”, and as the consequence of sinful behavior, such as [[prostitution]], sex with multiple partners or [[promiscuity]].&lt;ref name="Tackling AIDS"/&gt; Awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is growing among the Muslim community and efforts are being initiated to prevent its spread. The Muslim Awareness Programme (MAP), based in South Africa is a faith-based organization that promotes HIV/AIDS prevention strategies based on the moral teachings of Islam. These activities include the promotion of [[abstinence]] from all sexual activity outside marriage; refraining from drug use, and instilling faithfulness within marriage. According to most Muslims, the key to combating to the HIV/AIDS epidemic is prevention.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In their view, the Islamic position on morality, chastity and the sanctity of marriage needs to be shared with the world. Islam cites sex with multiple partners, sex outside marriage, other promiscuous sexual behaviors and [[homosexuality]] as immoral and as a result of this some Muslims consider this behavior the main cause of HIV/AIDS, believing that promoting abstinence, chastity, and intramarital sex is the key to ending or at least containing the epidemic.

===Judaism and Jewish thinkers===
As opposed to the Catholic Church and some other denominations or religions, today, there isn't any central Jewish religious authority that is acceptable by vast majority of religious Jews or by most Jewish religious movements.

[[Orthodox Judaism]] links between immoral sexual behavior and AIDS. [[Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits]], former Chief Rabbi of England, a prominent figure in 20th century Jewish medical ethics&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits]]&lt;/ref&gt; maintains in his article "Halachic Perspectives on AIDS" that "... from my reading of Jewish sources, it would appear that under no circumstances would we be justified in branding the incidence of the disease (...) as punishment ... we have not the vision, that would enable us to link, as an assertion of certainty, any form of human travail, grief, bereavement or suffering in general with shortcomings of a moral nature... It is one thing to speak of a consequence, and it is quite another thing to speak of a punishment ... if you warn a child not to play with fire, lest he gets burnt, and the child then gets burnt, then the burning may not be a punishment for not listening, but it certainly is a consequence. ... I think we should declare in very plain and explicit terms indicating that our society violated some of the norms of the Divine Law, and of the natural law, and that as a consequence we pay a price, and an exceedingly heavy price. This certainly is Jewish doctrine ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medethics.org.il/articles/JME/JMEB2/JMEB2.14.asp] ASSIA – ''Jewish Medical Ethics'', Vol. 2, No. 1, January 1991, pp. 3–8&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jewish Orthodox]] society, having AIDS is considered a mark of disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Responses to HIV: A Mitzvah|url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art56481.html|work=TheBody.com|accessdate=27 January 2014|author=Alana Krivo-Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism]] emphasize the importance of ''[[bikur cholim]]'', the responsibility to care for the sick:
:"The [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]] calls upon all of its congregations to reach out to individuals infected with the AIDS virus, their families and their friends by providing acceptance, comfort, counseling, and sympathetic and empathetic listening; and ... affirms that those infected with the AIDS virus must be protected from all forms of [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|illegal discrimination]], such as discriminatory housing, employment, health care delivery services and synagogue services."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Synagogue Resolution On AIDS|url=http://www.jewishlasvegas.com/page.aspx?id=12085|publisher=The Jewish Federation of Las Vegas|accessdate=27 June 2013|author=United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism|year=1991 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920230253/http://www.jewishlasvegas.com/page.aspx?id=12085 |archivedate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Marla J. Feldman, Director of the Joint Commission on Social Action of the Union for Reform Judaism: "However, we must look past the incomprehensible statistics and long lists of facts and recognize the Divine image within the faces of the individual people infected and affected by this disease. The responsibility lies with each of us to protect and care for these victims ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rac.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=1999&amp;pge_prg_id=13740 |publisher=Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism|title=Reform Jewish Leader Mourns AIDS Deaths and Calls for Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Prevention |accessdate=April 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127211945/http://rac.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=1999&amp;pge_prg_id=13740 |archivedate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
Many Christian charities provide services for people living with HIV/AIDS.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} One example is the [[DREAM (AIDS therapy program)|"Drug Resources Enhancement against Aids and Malnutrition" (DREAM)]], program promoted by the [[Christian]] [[Community of Sant'Egidio]].

[[Jerry Falwell]] regularly linked the [[AIDS pandemic]] to LGBT issues and stated, "AIDS is not just God's punishment for homosexuals, it is God's punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals."&lt;ref name="Falwell"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.milforddailynews.com/opinion/x1987843539|title=Press: The Sad Legacy of Jerry Falwell|accessdate=2007-05-18|last= Press|first = Bill |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430144811/http://www.milforddailynews.com/opinion/x1987843539 |archivedate=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
[[Hinduism]] has shown support for research aimed at curing HIV/AIDS, and care for those affected by HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Tackling AIDS"/&gt;

==Prevention==
===Catholicism===
{{main|Catholic Church and AIDS}}
The Catholic Church opposes [[condom]] use between heterosexual couples because it is an artificial form of [[contraception]] that does not rely on the functions of the body (and thus also God's will) itself as to whether a conception will occur or not, and the Church believes it also serves to implicitly and inexcusably encourage premarital and extramarital sexuality (and recourse to abortion if the condom fails).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[Pope John Paul II]] strongly opposed the use of artificial birth control, and rejected the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV.&lt;ref name="John Paul II and condoms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1979145,00.html|title=Catholic Church to Ease Ban on Condom Use|date=24 April 2006|publisher=© 2006, 2009 Deutsche Welle|accessdate=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XVI]] stated in 2005 that condoms were not a sufficient solution to the AIDS crisis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Pope rejects condoms for Africa|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4081276.stm | date=2005-06-10 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then in 2009 claimed that AIDS "cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which even aggravates the problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Telegraph|title=Pope Benedict XVI: condoms make Aids crisis worse|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/5005357/Pope-Benedict-XVI-condoms-make-Aids-crisis-worse.html | date=2009-03-17 | accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moscow Patriarchate]] gave support to Benedict XVI's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/international/africa/story.php?id=32756 |title=Moscow Patriarchate Backs Pope's Stance on Condoms |publisher=Zenit News Agency |date=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Benedict XVI's statements, the [[United Church of Christ]] issued a statement encouraging condom distribution at places of worship.&lt;ref name="UCC and condoms"&gt;[http://www.ucc.org/news/uccs-health-advocates-press.html UCC’s health advocates press for increased condom distribution]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, 2010, when questioned about the rampant HIV spread in Africa, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] suggested that the use of condoms in male prostitution is not a moral solution to stopping AIDS, but could represent a first step in assuming moral responsibility "in the intention of reducing the risk of infection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101120/ap_on_re_eu/eu_pope_condoms |title=Pope says some condom use first step of morality |website=Yahoo News |publisher=Associated Press |date=20 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121121202/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101120/ap_on_re_eu/eu_pope_condoms |archivedate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vatican City clarifies, after Benedict's statement sows confusion, that the position of the Church on condoms has not changed. It is merely a statement that in homosexual relations, where unnatural contraception is not the main concern, condoms can be seen as moral responsibility in preventing HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-11-20-pope-condoms_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Vatican clarifies pope's condom comments: Nothing's changed | date=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 23, 2010, Benedict furthermore stated that the concept of condoms as a lesser evil in preventing HIV infections can be applied to women as well. The use of condoms is the first step in taking responsibility and attempting to prevent the infection of one's partner. The Pope does not say anything about condoms being acceptable as unnatural birth control, only as a responsible approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40331930/ns/world_news-europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
In Thailand, some Buddhist monks encourage the use of condoms for HIV prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=52,3702,0,0,1,0|title=Buddhist Monk Embraces Condoms|date=2007-02-07|accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of [[Mechai Viravaidya]]'s pro-condom campaign, Buddhist monks have offered blessed condoms for couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/rxforsurvival/series/champions/mechai_viravaidya.html|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|title = Global Health Champions: Mechai Viravaidya|accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
The work of some Christian ministries has affected the treatment of AIDS. According to the African Health Policy Network, some churches in [[London]] claim that prayer will cure AIDS and the [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]-based Centre for the Study of Sexual Health and HIV reports that several people have stopped taking their medication, sometimes on the direct advice of their [[pastor]], leading to a number of deaths.&lt;ref name=BBC18102011&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14406818|title=Church HIV prayer cure claims 'cause three deaths'|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=18 October 2011|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Synagogue Church Of All Nations]] advertise an "anointing water" to promote God's healing, although the group deny advising people to stop taking medication,&lt;ref name=BBC18102011 /&gt; and US [[patent application]] 2001051133 similarly suggests that intravenous pure distilled water will eradicate HIV through the mercy of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2001051133|status=application}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian churches actively distribute HIV/AIDS medication.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10934">'''Rule by decree''' is a style of governance allowing quick, unchallenged creation of law by a single person or group, and is used primarily by [[dictator]]s, [[absolute monarch]]s and [[military]] leaders.

The expression is also sometimes used when describing actions of democratic governments that are perceived to unduly bypass parliamentarian or popular scrutiny.

Rule by [[decree]] allows the ruler to arbitrarily create law, without approval by a [[legislative]] assembly.

When states of emergency such as [[martial law]] are in place, rule by decree is common. While rule by decree is easily susceptible to the whims and corruption of the person in power, it is also highly efficient: a law can take weeks or months to pass in a legislature, but can be created with the stroke of a pen by a leader ruling by decree. This is what makes it valuable in emergency situations. Thus, it is allowed by many [[constitutions]], among which is the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]], [[Constitution of Argentina|Argentine Constitution]], [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]], etc.

==Lex Titia and Second Triumvirate==
One of the first examples of rule by decree was in the ancient [[Roman Republic]] when, after the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC, his successor, Gaius Octavian ([[Augustus]]), general [[Mark Antony]] and succeeding [[pontifex maximus]] [[Aemilius Lepidus]] seized power in the [[Second Triumvirate]], officially recognized by the [[roman senate|senate]] by the [[Lex Titia]] decree. The resolution, which gave the three 'triumvirs' authoritarian powers for five years, was enacted and reinstated consecutive in 38 BC. It finally collapsed in 33/32 BC, after the downfall of Lepidus, leading to the [[Final war of the Roman Republic]] and the total collapse of republican government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ancient.eu/Second_Triumvirate/ |title=Second Triumvirate |last=Wasson |first=Donald L. |date=18 April 2016 |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February 1933==
The most prominent example in history is the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]]. [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|German President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] was convinced by [[Adolf Hitler]] to issue a decree suspending basic civil rights indefinitely.  As a result of this decree, [[Nazism|Nazi]] authorities were able to constitutionally suppress or imprison their opposition, which in turn paved the way for the one-party rule of the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/learn/timeline-of-events/1933-1938/reichstag-fire-decree |title=Reichstag Fire Decree |last= |first= |date= |website=ushmm.org |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |access-date=14 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing [[State of emergency|state of exception]], which suspended the Constitution without repealing it, lasted until the end of the Third Reich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/ay-e-kad-o-lu/coup-d-tat-attempt-turkey-s-reichstag-fire |title=Coup d'état attempt: Turkey’s Reichstag fire? |last=Kadıoğlu |first=Ayşe |date=16 July 2016 |website=opendemocracy.net |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Decrees in non-dictatorial regimes==
Some democratic leaders, such as the presidents of [[President of Mexico|Mexico]], [[President of France|France]] and [[President of Argentina|Argentina]] may rule by decree in national emergencies, subject to constitutional and other legal limitations. In the case of France this power has been used only once, by [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1961 during the [[Algerian War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robinsonlibrary.com/history/france/france/20th/1958.htm |title=France in 1958 |last= |first= |date=22 June 2016 |website=robinsonlibrary.com |publisher=The Robinson Library |access-date=14 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modern political concepts, such as the French [[decree]]s, [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] in the British Commonwealth and American [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]]s are partially based on this notion of decrees, although they are far more limited in scope and generally subject to [[judicial review]].

===India===
During the [[Indian Emergency]] from 1975 to 1977, Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] had laws passed that allowed her to rule by decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/specials/in-depth/the-emergency-imposed-by-indira-gandhi-government/article7357305.ece |title=Emergency: The Dark Age of Indian democracy |last= |first= |date=27 June 2015 |website=thehindu.com |publisher=The Hindu |access-date=14 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
Ireland's [[Emergency Powers Act 1939|Emergency Powers Act]] allows the government to rule by decrees called ''Emergency Powers Orders'' in any aspect of national life, if the [[Oireachtas|parliament]] invokes the emergency clause in Article 28(3) of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]].  The Act however allows the [[Dáil Éireann|lower house]] to void specific EPOs in a free vote or end the state of emergency at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1939/act/28/enacted/en/print.html |title=Emergency Powers Act, 1939 |last= |first= |date=3 September 1939 |website=irishstatutebook.ie |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Giorgio Agamben's critique of the use of decrees-law==
Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] has claimed that there has been an explosion in the use of various types of decrees (decree-law, presidential decrees, executive orders, etc.) since [[World War I]]. According to him, this is the sign of a "generalization of the [[state of exception]]".

'''Rémi Brague''' (born 8 September 1947) is a French historian of philosophy, specializing in the Arabic, Jewish, and Christian thought of the Middle Ages. He is professor emeritus of Arabic and religious philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and Romano Guardini chair of philosophy (emeritus) at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]].

== Biography ==
Educated primarily at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris, Brague began his career as a student of Greek philosophy, interpreted in a distinctly modern key: his doctoral thesis, later published as ''Aristote et la question du monde: Essai sur le contexte cosmologique et anthropologique de l'ontologie'' (1988), developed a phenomenological account of Aristotle's conception of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Rockmore, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lcins1akebcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=heidegger+and+french+philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KR75Uf78AcSMyAHVloG4Dg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=heidegger%20and%20french%20philosophy&amp;f=false Heidegger and French Philosophy: Humanism, Anti-Humanism, and Being]'' (London: Routledge, 1995), 130.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, his goal was to write the book on Aristotle that [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] would have written, had he not written ''[[Being and Time]].''&lt;ref&gt;On the role of Heideggerian [[Dasein]] in Brague’s account of Aristotle, see Sarah Broadie, Review of ''Aristote et la question du monde.'' ''Ancient Philosophy'' 13.1 (Spring, 1993): 201-204. &lt;/ref&gt; From there, he was led to study Hebrew, in order to read the Old Testament, and Arabic in order "to read the Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]]' ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' in its original language."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarionreview.org/2009/10/%E2%80%9Cyellow-ants%E2%80%9D-fundamentalists-and-cowboys/ "'Yellow Ants,' Fundamentalists, and Cowboys – An interview with Rémi Brague."] ''The Clarion Review''. October 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, most of his work has taken place at the intersection of the three Abrahamic religions,&lt;ref&gt;A term Brague deprecates, as each religion understands Abraham, as well as its relation to Abraham, in fundamentally different ways. See ''On the God of the Christians (And on One or Two Others)'' (South Bend, IN: St. Augustine’ Press, 2013), 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt; as they developed out of the ancient world, formed themselves in dialogue with one another, and eventually gave rise to modernity. He is the author of numerous books on classical and medieval intellectual history, religion, national identity, literature and law, and is perhaps best known in the English-speaking world for his book ''Europe, la voie romaine'' (1992), translated into English as ''Eccentric Culture: A Theory of Western Civilization'' (2009). His masterwork thus far is his trilogy on the philosophical development of law in the West, ''La Sagesse du monde: Histoire de l'expérience humaine de l'univers'' (1999), ''La Loi de Dieu. Histoire philosophique d’une alliance'' (2005), and ''Le Règne de l'homme: Genèse et échec du projet moderne'' (2015): the first two have been translated as ''The Wisdom of the World: The Human Experience of the Universe in Western Thought'' (2004) and ''The Law of God: The Philosophical History of an Idea'' (2007); the third is forthcoming under the title, ''The Kingdom of man: The Genesis and Failure of the Modern Project. ''&lt;ref&gt;See Paul Seaton, “Translator’s Introduction” to ''The Legitimacy of the Human'' (South Bend, IN: St. Augustine’ Press, 2017) xi.&lt;/ref&gt;


While his intellectual influences are various, Brague has developed some of the chief points of his unique account of Western intellectual history in dialogue with the controversial political theorist [[Leo Strauss]]: Brague has said that "Leo Strauss taught me that when reading a text, you must be open to the possibility that it contains different layers of meaning. All philosophical books written before the Enlightenment aim at both a wider audience and a small elite, able to understand the deeper meaning of the texts." This approach informed Brague's understanding of Maimonides and the medieval Muslim philosopher [[Al-Farabi]], among others, but he declared himself unconvinced "that it applies to the Greek philosophers" in the way Strauss has taught. "But Strauss became so convinced of his own way of interpreting texts, that he came to apply it to all sorts of books, even Cervantes''' [[Don Quixote]]''. Strauss taught me to read very carefully. But I don't consider myself a Straussian, nor do the real Straussians consider me as one of them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarionreview.org/2009/10/%E2%80%9Cyellow-ants%E2%80%9D-fundamentalists-and-cowboys/ "'Yellow Ants,' Fundamentalists, and Cowboys – An interview with Rémi Brague."] ''The Clarion Review'' (Oct. 29, 2009). On Brague’s view of Strauss’s Maimonides, see “Leo Strauss and Maimonides,” in ''Leo Strauss’s Thought: Toward a Critical Engagement,'' ed. Alan Udoff (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner, 1991), 93-114. On the kinds of texts (esp. Christian ones) to which Straussian interpretation fails to be adequate, see Brague, "Athens, Jerusalem, Mecca: Leo Strauss's 'Muslim' Understanding of Greek Philosophy,” ''Poetics Today'' 19.2 (Summer 1998): 235–259.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably, Brague's "Roman" view of Western Intellectual History (as enunciated in ''Eccentric Culture'') forms a kind of response to Strauss' famous emphasis on the centuries-long tension between Athens and Jerusalem: for Brague, we cannot understand this tension correctly without understanding the historic mediation of both Athens and Jerusalem through Rome.&lt;ref&gt;See Mark Shiffman, [http://www.mmisi.org/ma/47_02/shiffman.pdf "Neither Greek nor Jew: A Review of Remi Brague, ''Eccentric Culture'',"] ''Modern Age'' 47.2 (Spring 2005): 160–163. See also Remi Brague, "Athens—Jerusalem—Rome," ''Communio'' 40.1 (Spring 2013): 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Brague's account of Divine Law in the Western intellectual tradition (as presented in ''The Law of God'') reframes the relationship between faith and reason, the secular and the sacred, in response to Strauss' recurrent emphasis on "the Theological-Political Problem."&lt;ref&gt;See Christopher Morrissey, [http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2007/2007-09-46.html "Review of ''The Law of God'', by Remi Brague,"] ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' (Sep. 2009). See also Adam Kirsh, [http://www.nysun.com/arts/divine-law-and-history-remi-brague/54090/ "Divine Law and History: Remi Brague,"] ''New York Sun'' (May 9, 2007). And for Brague’s transformation of the “theologico-political problem,” see ''The Law of God,'' 2-8.&lt;/ref&gt;


Brague is the recipient of numerous awards, including honors by both the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] and the [[Academy of Moral and Political Science]]. In 2009, he received both the [[Josef Pieper]] Prize &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franz-hitze-haus.de/index.php?cat_id=20380 "Rémi Brague – Preisträger des Josef Pieper Preises 2009"] ''Akademie Franz Hitze Haus'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Grand prix de philosophie de l'[[Académie française]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academie-francaise.fr/remi-brague "Rémi Brague: Prix de l'Académie française"] ''Académie française'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and on Saturday, 28 September 2012, it was announced that Brague, along with [[Brian E. Daley]], would be awarded the 2012 [[Ratzinger Prize]] for Theology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/ratzinger-prize-awarded-to-philosopher-remi-brague-and-historian-fr-brian-daley "Ratzinger Prize Awarded to Philosopher Remi Brague and Historian Fr. Brian Daley."] ''Zenit.org'' (Sep. 28, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he was named a Chevalier de l'Ordre National de la [[Légion d'honneur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=6F6BEB4960D90C894B13DAD8796A3757.tpdjo11v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000026871328&amp;dateTexte=&amp;oldAction=rechJO&amp;categorieLien=id "Décret du 31 décembre 2012 portant promotion et nomination"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel (de) Sorbière''' ({{IPA-fr|sɔʁbjɛʁ|lang}}; 1615–1670) was a [[France|French]] physician and man of letters, a [[philosopher]] and [[translation|translator]], who is best known for his promotion of the works of [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Pierre Gassendi]], in whose view of physics he placed his support, though unable to refute [[René Descartes]], but who developed a reputation in his own day for a truculent and disputatious nature.&lt;ref&gt;Albert G. A. Balz, "Samuel Sorbière (1615-1670)" ''The Philosophical Review'' '''39'''6 (November 1930), pp. 573-586&lt;/ref&gt;  Sorbière is regarded often by his position on ethics and disclosure about medical mistakes.  In 1672 Sorbière considered the idea of being honest and upfront about a mistake having been made in medicine but thought that it might seriously jeopardise medical practice and concluded that it "would not catch on".&lt;ref&gt;De Sorbiere S. Advice to a young physician respecting the way in which he is to conduct himself in the practice of medicine, in view of the indifference of the public to the subject, and considering the complaints that are made about physicians (1672). Quoted in: Katz J. The silent world of doctor and patient. New York: Free Press, 1984:10-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
After relocating to the [[Netherlands]], he published a French translation of [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' in 1643. He arranged for the publication of Hobbes's ''[[De Cive]]'' in [[Amsterdam]] in 1647, published a French translation in 1649, published a French translation of Hobbes' ''De Corpore Politico, or the Elements of Law'' in 1652, and helped secure a publisher for Hobbes's own Latin translation of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' in 1668. His collected ''Lettres et discours de M. de Sorbière, sur diverses matières curieuses'', published in Paris, 1660, are imbued with the spirit of compromise, reconciling science and theology and separating science from [[metaphysics]]. His life of Gassendi was prefixed to the collected edition of Gassendi's writings, 1658. Besides Gassendi and Hobbes, he corresponded with [[Marin Mersenne]], [[François de La Mothe Le Vayer]] and other prominent thinkers of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Barnouw, "Britain and European literature and thought," ''The Cambridge History of English Literature, 1660-1780'' ({{ISBN|0-521-78144-2}}), pp.&amp;nbsp;430-431.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1663-1664, Sorbière visited [[England]], where in 1663 he was inducted into the [[Royal Society]]. In 1664 he published an account of his stay, ''Relation d’un voyage en Angleterre, où sont touchées plusieurs choses, qui regardent l’estat des sciences, et de la religion.'' (L. Billaine, Paris),&lt;ref&gt;An English translation, ''A Voyage to England: containing many things relating to the state of  ...'' appeared in 1709.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he offered his comments on how bad the food was, how bad the inns were and imputed to the Royal Society the intention of developing a library. This provoked [[Thomas Sprat]] (then spokesman for and historian of the Society) to publish ''Observations upon Monsieur de Sorbier's Voyage into England'' (London: 1665) as a reply to Sorbière's perceived insults against both English culture and the Society in particular. In order to avoid further international controversy, Sorbière was held under arrest for four months in France, and [[Charles II of England]] prohibited any further responses.

Sorbière's conversion from [[Calvinism]] to Catholicism, which opened a career to him, has been interpreted in a political light.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, by [[Francisque Bouillier]], ''Histoire de la philosophie cartésienne'', 3rd ed. 1868. vol. I, p. 561ff, noted by Balz.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haalelea's Feather Cape.png|thumb|right|A [[ʻAhu ʻula|feather cloak (''ʻahu ʻula'')]] which was a symbol of rank in [[Ancient Hawaii|Hawaii]]]]
{{unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
[[Leadership]] cadres use '''[[symbol]]s''' to reinforce their [[Political power|position power]] and provide a level of differentiation. [[Clothing]] frequently articulates rank or privilege, but accessories and external entities of varying functionality may also serve to mark out leaders - from [[finger ring]]s to personal aircraft.

==Presidential symbols==
Presidential symbols include many various insignia or other devices to denote a president's position. Some symbols follow accepted constitutional or [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] standards: [[flag]]s, [[sash]]es, entrance Marches or a [[medallion]] or [[necklace]]. The use of the symbols mostly occurs for domestic purposes.

Examples of such symbols include the [[President of the United States|American]] presidential march "[[Hail to the Chief]]", and the [[presidential sash]]es worn by the presidents of [[Latin America]] nations. More practical, semi-symbolic features also abound: bodyguards may lurk semi-overtly; a head of state may use a special aircraft (see for example [[Air Force One]]).

European presidents sometimes dress archaically for formal occasions. Such special clothing sets them apart - and may well militate against women aspiring to such high office when tradition expects them to wear (say) [[knee-breeches]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

==Royal/Imperial symbols==
Ruling dynasties often exploit pomp and ceremony with the use of [[regalia]]: [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]], [[robe]]s, [[orb and sceptre]]s, some of which are reflections of formerly practical objects. The use of language mechanisms also support this differentiation with subjects talking of "the crown" and/or of "the [[throne]]" rather than referring directly to personal names and items.

[[Monarch]]ies provide the most explicit demonstration of tools to strengthen the elevation of leaders. Thrones sit high on [[dais]]es leading to subjects lifting their gaze (if they have permission) to contemplate the ruler. Architecture in general can set leaders apart: note the symbolism inherent in the very name of the Chinese imperial [[Forbidden City]].

The culture and legends about the ruling family may build on myths of [[Divine right of kings|divine-right]] and describe the ruler or the [[Son of Heaven (disambiguation)|Son of Heaven]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

[[Noble court|Court]] ceremonial highlights symbolic distance between a royal/imperial leader and follower, in a hierarchical system which cultivates a social system and power network at whose centre is the monarch. [[Bowing (social)|Bowing]] and [[curtsey]]ing remain as examples of the self-abasement of [[hand-sucking]], bowing and scraping, [[prostration]], [[kowtow]]ing and ''[[proskynesis]]'' formerly demanded.

Sometimes [[colour]] plays a special role in advertising monarchical status: thus the once very rare pink/maroon dye color became a symbol reserved for imperial clothing - see [[purple#Symbolism|purple]].

Archaic touches often symbolically recall a glorious historical past: thus horse-drawn [[carriage]]s replace everyday motor-vehicles for royal state occasions, and [[courtier]]s and flunkeys in elaborate [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom|dress]] grant a sense of ancient distance. And monarchs emphasize the remaining traces of their [[Divine right of kings|divine right]] to rule when undergoing anointing at the hands of the Church during coronation ceremonies.

==Socio-political leadership symbols==
Overlapping with and/or emulating royalty, a [[ruling class]] or an [[aristocracy]] can devote much of its energy into "keeping up appearances" and emphasizing the purity of noble blood by apartness. Symbolism can aid this process cheaply. A [[coat-of-arms]] (perhaps in the form of a banner or on note-paper) or the wearing of a [[sword]] can incur less expense than maintaining a [[stately home]]. The visible presence of [[servant]]s or [[Slavery|slave]]s reminds underlings of [[social distance]]. [[Patronage]], especially of [[fashion]], provides one of the most symbolic attributes of social leaders or would-be leaders. Compare [[conspicuous consumption]].

==Military leadership symbols==
Apart from more elaborate [[uniform]] and their distinguishing marks ([[epaulette]]s, caps, [[medal]]s), senior military officers may traditionally carry a [[Baton (symbol)|baton]] or affect a similar substitute (such as a [[swagger stick]] or [[Walking stick|cane]]). Compare [[staff of office]].

[[Banner]]s, [[Pennon|pennant]]s and [[guidon (heraldic flag)|guidon]]s serve (or served in the past) to identify leaders as rallying-points or field command-posts. Traces of these continue on [[staff car]]s or on naval ships, for example: see [[broad pennant]] and compare the concept and origin of a [[flagship]].

==Ecclesiastical leadership symbols==
Religious dignitaries often use [[vestment]]s to emphasize the overall sacred nature of their organization. But some touches identify leaders and make them more imposing: a bishop's [[mitre]], for example, a cardinal's [[Red hat (Catholic)|red hat]], a papal [[tiara]] or a [[papal ring]]. Less flamboyant faiths may use subtler symbolism to set religious leadership, holiness or saintliness apart: the understated dark vestments of the Protestant clergyman, the relatively unobtrusive [[clerical collar]], or even the nakedness of a stereotypical [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ascetic [[fakir]].

==Gender-related leadership symbols==
Ownership of a [[harem]] has both practical and symbolic uses for leaders in traditional polygamous societies: harems spread genes and symbolically demonstrate wealth and status. Within such harems whole systems of symbolism may develop: the use of exclusive and inaccessible apartness, [[veil]]ing, and the employment of [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]]. Cultures which practise [[serial monogamy]] feature harem-analogous symbolism in the flaunting of [[trophy wife|trophy wives]].

Items such as [[codpiece]]s may suggest the assumed superiority of one [[gender role|gender-role]] over another: or symbolic leadership (implied by implied potency) within [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] structures. A slightly less extreme example, but one more common in modern times, expresses [[power (sociology)|power]] relationships (and thus leadership symbolism) through the use of the phrase "wearing the [[trousers]]".

Ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s used a stylised artificial [[labdanum]]-soaked goats-hair [[beard]] as one of the regalia of rulership: a clear case of associating a male attribute with leadership.

==Symbols of leadership in offices==
The [[leisure suit (clothing)|suit]] continues to mark out the [[managerial class]] (which pretends to [[leadership]] functions) as a whole from ordinary [[black-collar worker|blue-collar]] or non-suited [[worker]]s. Suits stand at the apex of a system of [[dress code]] details: [[international standard business attire]], with largely symbolic associations; see for example:
* [[Collar (clothing)]]
* [[Business casual]]
* [[Necktie]]
* [[White-collar worker]]

At the top levels of a [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] organisation, senior leaders often attempt to merge the practical with the symbolic, making the [[employee benefit|perks]] of office appear functional: they may claim larger cars, smaller computers, an entrance guarded by a (non-digital) [[personal assistant]], a large but uncluttered [[desk]] and (especially) a "[[corner office]]" with an aesthetically uplifting [[Panorama|view]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7202">The '''Symbolic''' (or '''Symbolic Order''') is a part of the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory of [[Jacques Lacan]], part of his attempt "to distinguish between those elementary registers whose grounding I later put forward in these terms: the symbolic, the imaginary, and the real — a distinction never previously made in psychoanalysis".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise==

Lacan's early work was centred on an exploration of [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]], of those "specific images, which we refer to by the ancient term of ''imago''. ... it set out from their formative function in the subject".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore "[t]he notion of the "symbolic came to the forefront in the Rome Report [1953] ... henceforth it is the symbolic, not the imaginary, that is seen to be the determining order of the subject".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Sheridan]],"Translator' Note", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994) p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacan's concept of the symbolic "owes much to a key event in the rise of structuralism ... the publication of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' in 1949. ... In many ways, the symbolic is for Lacan an equivalent to Lévi-Strauss's order of culture":&lt;ref&gt;[[David Macey]], "Introduction", Lacan, ''Four'', p. xxii and p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt; a language-mediated order of culture. "Man speaks, then, but it is because the symbol has made him man ... superimposes the kingdom of culture on that of a nature".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 65–6&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting then that "language is the basic social institution in the sense that all others presuppose language",&lt;ref&gt;[[John R. Searle]], ''The Construction of Social Reality'' (London 1995) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan found in [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s linguistic division of the verbal sign between signifier and signified a new key to the Freudian understanding that "his therapeutic method was 'a talking cure'".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud and Joseph Breuer, quoted in Macey, ''Four'', p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triumph==

For a decade or so after the Rome Report, Lacan found in the concept of the symbolic an answer to the neurotic problematic of the imaginary: "It is the task of symbolism to forbid imaginary capture ... supremacy of the symbolic over the imaginary ... supremacy of the symbolic over the real".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller, "Commentary" in Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 332 and p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting through Lévi-Strauss the anthropological premise that "man is indeed an 'animal symbolicum'", and that "the self-illumination of society through symbols is an essential part of social reality",&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Schutz, ''The Problem of Social Reality'' (The Hague 1973) p. 356 and p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan made the leap to seeing "the Oedipus complex - in so far as we continue to recognise it as covering the whole field of our experience with its signification"&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; - as the point whereby the weight of social reality was mediated to the developing child by the (symbolic) father: "It is in the ''[[name of the Father]]'' that we must recognize the support of the symbolic function which, from the dawn of history, has identified his person with the figure of the law".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The imaginary now came to be seen increasingly as belonging to the earlier, closed realm of the dual relationship of mother and child — "[[Melanie Klein]] describes the relation to the mother as a mirrored relationship ... [neglecting] the third term, the father"&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Seminar III, in J. Mitchell and J. Rose, ''Feminine Sexuality'' (New York 1982) p. 57–8&lt;/ref&gt; — to be broken up and opened to the wider symbolic order.

Lacan's shorthand for that wider world was the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] — "the big other, that is, the other of language, the Names-of-the-Father, signifiers or words [which] ... are public, communal property".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hill, ''Lacan for Beginners'' (London 1997) p. 160 and p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; But though it is an essentially linguistic dimension, Lacan does not simply equate the symbolic with language, since the latter is involved also in the Imaginary and [[the Real]]. The symbolic dimension of language is that of the [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]], in which elements have no positive existence but are constituted by virtue of their mutual differences.

The [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] is the discourse of the Other and thus belongs to the symbolic order. It is also the realm of the Law that regulates desire in the [[Oedipus complex]], and is determinant of [[subjectivity]]. "The unconscious is the sum of the effects of speech on a subject, at the level at which the subject constitutes himself out of the effects of the signifier ... we depend on the field of the Other, which was there long before we came into the world, and whose circulating structures determine us as subjects"&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Four'', p. 126 and p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; on the symbolic order.

==Eclipse==

With the Sixties, the early rush of expectations associated with the concept of the symbolic order had begun to fade, and the symbolic was increasingly seen as ''part'' of the human condition, rather than as a therapeutic cure-all. Lacan's critical attention began to shift instead to the concept of the Real, seen as "that over which the symbolic stumbles ... that which is lacking in the symbolic order, the ineliminable residue of all articulation ... the umbilical cord of the symbolic".&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, ''Four'', p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

By the turn of the decade, "(1968–71) Lacan gradually came to dismiss the Oedipus ... as 'Freud's dream'"&lt;ref&gt;J. Clemens and R. Grigg eds., ''Jacques Lacan and the Other Side of Psychoanalysis: Reflections on Seminar XVII'' (London 2006) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; — despite his own earlier warning of the dangers if "one wishes to ignore the symbolic articulation that Freud discovered at the same time as the unconscious ... his methodical reference to the Oedipus complex".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether his development of the concept of ''[[jouissance]]'', or 'the "identification with the ''[[sinthome]]''" (as the naming of one's Real) advocated in Lacan's last works as the aim of psychoanalysis',&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo Chiesa, ''Subjectivity and Otherness'' (London 2007) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; will in time prove as fruitful as that of the symbolic order perhaps remains to be seen. Part of Lacan's enduring legacy will surely however remain bound up with the triumphal exploration of the symbolic order that was the Rome Report: "Symbols in fact envelop the life of man in a network so total that they join together ... the shape of his destiny".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Early Buddhist schools|distinct school of early Buddhism]], Theravāda Buddhism developed in [[Sri Lanka]] and subsequently [[Buddhism in Southeast Asia|spread to the rest of Southeast Asia]]. It is the dominant form of religion in [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Thailand]], and is practiced by minority groups in [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[Nepal]], and [[Vietnam]]. In addition, the [[diaspora]] of all of these groups as well as converts around the world practice Theravāda Buddhism. Contemporary expressions include [[Buddhist modernism]], the [[Vipassana movement]], and the [[Thai Forest Tradition]].

==History==

===Origins===
[[Image:Nava Jetavana Temple - Shravasti - 014 King Asoka at the Third Council (9241725897).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ashoka]] and [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] at the Third Council, at the Nava Jetavana, Shravasti]]
{{EarlyBuddhism}}
The name Theravāda comes{{refn|group=lower-alpha| [[Pali#Vowels and diphthongs|Source]] says,"Technical terms from Sanskrit were converted into Pali by a set of conventional phonological transformations". Vowels and diphthongs from Sanskrit to Pali follow this pattern. Thus 'Sth'''avi'''ra' in Sanskrit becomes 'Th'''e'''ra' in Pali. Sanskrit 'avi' becomes Pali 'e' (i.e. Sth'''avi'''ra → '''ai''' → Th'''e'''ra).}} from the ancestral [[Sthavira nikāya|Sthāvirīya]], one of the [[early Buddhist schools]], from which the Theravadins claim descent. The Sthavira nikāya arose during the first schism in the Buddhist sangha, due to their desire to add new [[Vinaya]] rules, against the wishes of the majority [[Mahāsāṃghika]] group who disagreed with this.&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. p. 49, 64&lt;/ref&gt; According to its own accounts, the Theravāda school is fundamentally derived from the [[Vibhajyavāda|Vibhajjavāda]] "doctrine of analysis" grouping,&lt;ref&gt;Cousins, Lance (2001). "[https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/BSR/article/view/8772/6247 On the Vibhajjavādins]", Buddhist Studies Review 18 (2), 131-182&lt;/ref&gt; which was a division of the Sthāvirīya.

According to [[Damien Keown]], there is no historical evidence that the Theravāda school arose until around two centuries after the Great [[Schism]] which occurred at the Third Council.&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien. ''A Dictionary of Buddhism.'' 2003. {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}. pp. 279-280&lt;/ref&gt; Theravadin accounts of its own origins mention that it received the teachings that were agreed upon during the putative [[Third Buddhist council]] under the patronage of the Indian Emperor [[Ashoka]] around 250 BCE. These teachings were known as the [[Vibhajyavāda|Vibhajjavāda]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa Akira (translated and edited by Paul Groner), ''A History Of India Buddhism'', Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi, 1993, page 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Ashoka is supposed to have assisted in purifying the sangha by expelling monks who failed to agree to the terms of Third Council.&lt;ref name="Crosby 2013 1–3"&gt;{{citation|last=Crosby|first=Kate|title=Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity|year=2013|pages=1–3|isbn=9781405189071|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elder monk [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] was at the head of the Third council and compiled the [[Kathavatthu]] ("Points of Controversy"), a refutation of various opposing views which is an important work in the Theravada Abhidhamma.

Later, the Vibhajjavādins in turn is said to have split into four groups: the [[Mahīśāsaka]], [[Kāśyapīya]], [[Dharmaguptaka]] in the north, and the Tāmraparṇīya in South India. The Tambapaṇṇiya (later [[Mahavihara of Anuradhapura|Mahāvihāravāsins]]), were established in Sri Lanka (at [[Anuradhapura]]) but active also in [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] and other parts of [[South India]] (Vanavasa in modern [[Karnataka]]) and later across [[Southeast Asia|South-East Asia]]. Inscriptional evidence of this school has been found in [[Amaravati]] and [[Nagarjunakonda]].&lt;ref&gt;Cousins, LS. On the Vibhajjavadins. The Mahimsasaka, Dhammaguttaka, Kassapiya and Tambapanniya branches of the ancient Theriyas, Buddhist Studies Review 18, 2 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Buddhist scholar [[A. K. Warder]], the Theravāda.

{{quote|spread rapidly south from [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]] into [[Maharashtra]] and [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] and down to the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] country ([[Kanchipuram|Kanchi]]), as well as Sri Lanka. For some time they maintained themselves in Avanti as well as in their new territories, but gradually they tended to regroup themselves in the south, the Great Vihara (Mahavihara) in [[Anuradhapura]], the ancient capital of Sri Lanka, becoming the main centre of their tradition, Kanchi a secondary center and the northern regions apparently relinquished to other schools.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=278}}}}

===Transmission to Sri Lanka===
[[File:116 Sanghamitta and the Bodhi Tree (20256206059).jpg|thumbnail|250px|Sanghamitta and the Bodhi Tree]]
The Theravāda is said to be descended from the Tāmraparṇīya sect, which means "the [[Sri Lanka]]n lineage". Missionaries sent abroad from India are said to have included Ashoka's son [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] (who studied under [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]]) and his daughter [[Sanghamitta]], and they were the mythical founders of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, a story which scholars suggest helps to legitimize Theravāda's claims of being the oldest and most authentic school.&lt;ref name="Crosby 2013 1–3"/&gt; According to the [[Mahavamsa]] chronicle their arrival in Sri Lanka is said to have been during the reign of [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura]] (307–267 BCE) who converted to Buddhism and helped build the first Buddhist stupas. According to S. D. Bandaranayake:

{{quote|The rapid spread of Buddhism and the emergence of an extensive organization of the sangha are closely linked with the secular authority of the central state ... There are no known artistic or architectural remains from this epoch except for the cave dwellings of the monks, reflecting the growth and spread of the new religion. The most distinctive features of this phase and virtually the only contemporary historical material, are the numerous Brahmi inscriptions associated with these caves. They record gifts to the sangha, significantly by householders and chiefs rather than by kings. The Buddhist religion itself does not seem to have established undisputed authority until the reigns of Dutthagamani and Vattagamani (ca mid-2nd century BCE to mid-1st century BCE)&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="sinhalese"&gt;Bandaranayake, S.D. Sinhalese Monastic Architecture: The Viháras of Anurádhapura, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first records of Buddha images come from the reign of king [[Vasabha of Anuradhapura|Vasabha]] (65–109 BCE), and after the 3rd century AD the historical record shows a growth of the worship of Buddha images as well as [[Bodhisattvas]].&lt;ref name="sinhalese" /&gt; In the 7th century, the Chinese pilgrim monks [[Xuanzang]] and [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] refer to the Buddhist schools in Sri Lanka as ''Shàngzuòbù'' ({{zh|c=上座部}}), corresponding to the Sanskrit [[Sthavira nikāya]] and Pali ''Thera Nikāya''.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beal, "Si-Yu-Ki&amp;nbsp;– Buddhist Records of the Western World&amp;nbsp;– Translated from the Chinese of Hiuen Tsiang AD 629", published by Tuebner and Co, London (1884), reprint by the Oriental Book Reprint Corporation, New Delhi (1983), Digital version: Chung-hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies, Taipei.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] writes, "In Sri Lanka the Sthavira school alone flourishes; the [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasanghikas]] are expelled".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beal, "The Life of Hiuen-Tsiang: By the Shaman Hwui Li. With an introduction containing an account of the works of I-tsing", published by Tuebner and Co, London (1911), Digital version: University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school has been using the name ''Theravāda'' for itself in a written form since at least the 4th century, about one thousand years after the Buddha's death, when the term appears in the ''[[Dipavamsa|Dīpavaṁsa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;It is used in the Dipavamsa (quoted in ''Debates Commentary'', Pali Text society, page 4), which is generally dated to the 4th century.&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=July 2015}}

Between the reigns of Sena I (833–853) and [[Mahinda IV of Anuradhapura|Mahinda IV]] (956–972), the city of [[Anuradhapura]] saw a "colossal building effort" by various kings during a long period of peace and prosperity, the great part of the present architectural remains in this city date from this period.&lt;ref&gt;Bandaranayake, S. D. ''Sinhalese Monastic Architecture: The Viháras of Anurádhapura'', page 25&lt;/ref&gt;

====Development of the Pali textual tradition====
{{main article|Pali literature}}
[[File:Buddhaghosa_with_three_copies_of_Visuddhimagga.jpg|thumbnail|[[Buddhaghosa]] (c. 5th century), the most important Abhidharma scholar of [[Theravāda]] Buddhism, presenting three copies of the [[Visuddhimagga]].]]
The Sri Lankan Buddhist Sangha initially preserved the Buddhist scriptures (the [[Tipitaka]]) orally as it had been traditionally done, however during the first century BCE, famine and wars led to the writing down of these scriptures. The Sri Lankan chronicle The [[Mahavamsa]] records: "Formerly clever monks preserved the text of the Canon and its commentaries orally, but then, when they saw the disastrous state of living beings, they came together and had it written down in books, that the doctrine might long survive."&lt;ref name="theravada buddhism"&gt;Gombrich, Theravada Buddhism, a social history from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo, Routledge; 2 edition (July 26, 2006), page 152&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Gombrich]] this is "the earliest record we have of Buddhist scriptures being committed to writing anywhere".&lt;ref name="theravada buddhism" /&gt; The Theravada Pali texts which have survived (with only a few exceptions) are derived from the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahavihara]] (monastic complex) of [[Anuradhapura]], the ancient Sri Lankan capital.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Sheldon I. ''Literary Cultures in History: Reconstructions from South Asia'', page 650&lt;/ref&gt;

Later developments included the formation and recording of the Theravada commentary literature ([[Atthakatha]]). The Theravada tradition records that even during the early days of [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], there was already a tradition of Indian commentaries on the scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, ''Theravada Buddhism, a social history from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo'', Routledge; 2 edition (26 July 2006), page 153&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the writing of the classic Theravada Pali commentaries, there were also various commentaries on the Tipitaka written in the [[Sinhalese language]], such as the [[Maha-atthakatha]] ("Great commentary"), the main commentary tradition of the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahavihara]] monks.&lt;ref&gt;Law, ''A history of Pali literature'', 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of great importance to the commentary tradition is the work of the great Theravada scholastic [[Buddhaghosa]] (4th–5th century CE), who is responsible for most of the Theravada commentarial literature that has survived (any older commentaries have been lost). [[Buddhaghosa]] wrote in [[Pali]], and after him, most Sri Lankan Buddhist scholastics did as well.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, ''Theravada Buddhism, a social history from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo'', Routledge; 2 edition (July 26, 2006), page 154&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the Sri Lankan tradition to become more international through a [[lingua franca]] so as to converse with monks in India and later Southeast Asia.

Theravada monks also produced other Pali literature such as historical chronicles (e.g. [[Mahavamsa]]), hagiographies, practice manuals, summaries, textbooks, poetry and Abhidhamma works such as the ''[[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]]'' and the ''[[Abhidhammavatara]]''. Buddhaghosa's work on Abhidhamma and Buddhist practice outlined in works such as the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' and the ''[[Atthasalini]]'' are the most influential texts apart from the Pali Canon in the Theravada tradition. Other Theravada Pali commentators and writers include [[Dhammapala]] and [[Buddhadatta]]. Dhammapala wrote commentaries on the Pali Canon texts which Buddhaghosa had omitted and also wrote a commentary called the ''Paramathamanjusa'' on Buddhaghosa's ''Visuddhimagga''.

====Sri Lankan Theravāda sects====
[[File:SRL-anuradhapura-abhagiriya-2.jpg|thumb|The restored Abhayagiri Dagoba (stupa) in [[Anuradhapura]]]]
Over much of the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, there were three subdivisions of Theravāda, consisting of the monks of the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahāvihāra]], [[Abhayagiri vihāra]] and [[Jetavanaramaya|Jetavana]]&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280"&gt;Warder, A. K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;, each of which were based in [[Anuradhapura]]. The Mahāvihāra was the first tradition to be established, while Abhayagiri Vihāra and Jetavana Vihāra were established by monks who had broken away from the Mahāvihāra tradition.&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280"/&gt; According to A. K. Warder, the Indian [[Mahīśāsaka]] sect also established itself in Sri Lanka alongside the Theravāda, into which they were later absorbed.&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280"/&gt; Northern regions of Sri Lanka also seem to have been ceded to sects from India at certain times.&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280"/&gt;

When the Chinese monk [[Faxian]] visited the island in the early 5th century, he noted 5000 monks at Abhayagiri, 3000 at the Mahāvihāra, and 2000 at the Cetiyapabbatavihāra.&lt;ref name="Hirakawa, Akira 2007. p. 121"&gt;Hirakawa, Akira; Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna.'' 2007. p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahavihara ("Great Monastery") school became dominant in Sri Lanka at the beginning of the 2nd millennium CE and gradually spread through mainland Southeast Asia. It was established in Myanmar in the late 11th century, in Thailand in the 13th and early 14th centuries, and in Cambodia and Laos by the end of the 14th century. Although Mahavihara never completely replaced other schools in Southeast Asia, it received special favor at most royal courts. This is due to the support it received from local elites, who exerted a very strong religious and social influence.

====Mahāyāna influence====

This sculpture was found on the east coast of Sri Lanka between [[Batticaloa]] and [[Trincomalee]] and is evidence of the presence of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] in the [[Anuradhapura period]] of Sri Lanka.]]
Over the centuries, the [[Abhayagiri vihāra|Abhayagiri]] Theravādins maintained close relations with Indian Buddhists and adopted many new teachings from India.&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna.'' 2007. p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; including many elements from [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] teachings, while the [[Jetavanaramaya|Jetavana]] Theravādins adopted Mahāyāna to a lesser extent.&lt;ref name="Hirakawa, Akira 2007. p. 121"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Richard Francis. ''Theravāda Buddhism: A Social History''. 1988. p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xuanzang]] wrote of two major divisions of Theravāda in Sri&amp;nbsp;Lanka, referring to the Abhayagiri tradition as the "Mahāyāna Sthaviras", and the Mahāvihāra tradition as the "[[Hinayana|Hīnayāna]] Sthaviras".&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang also wrote that the Mahāvihāravāsins reject the Mahāyāna as heretical, while the Abhayagirivihāravāsins study "both [[Hinayana|Hīnayāna]] and [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]]".&lt;ref name="Hirakawa, Akira 2007. p. 121" /&gt;

[[Abhayagiri vihāra|Abhayagiri]] was an influential university and center for the study of [[Mahayana]] from the reign of [[Gajabahu I]] until the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hoiberg, Dale H., ed. (2010). "Abhayagiri". ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. I: A-ak Bayes (15th ed.). Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. p. 30. {{ISBN|978-1-59339-837-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It saw various important Buddhist scholars working in Sanskrit and Pali. These include Upatissa (who wrote the ''[[Vimuttimagga]]''), Kavicakravarti Ananda (authored the ''Saddhammopåyana''), [[Aryadeva]], Aryasura, and the tantric masters Jayabhadra, and Candramåli.&lt;ref&gt;Rangama, Chandawimala;The impact of the Abhayagiri practices on the development of TheravadaBuddhism in Sri Lanka, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Akira Hirakawa notes that the surviving Pāli commentaries (''[[Atthakatha|{{IAST|Aṭṭhakathā}}]]'') of the Mahāvihāra school, when examined closely, also include a number of positions that agree with Mahāyāna teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna.'' 2007. p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Kalupahana notes the same for the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', the most important Theravāda commentary.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=206–208}}

It is known that in the 8th&amp;nbsp;century, both Mahāyāna and the esoteric [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] form of Buddhism were being practised in Sri&amp;nbsp;Lanka, and two Indian monks responsible for propagating Esoteric Buddhism in China, [[Vajrabodhi]] and [[Amoghavajra]], visited the island during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna.'' 2007. pp. 125–126&lt;/ref&gt; Abhayagiri Vihāra appears to have been a center for Theravadin Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna teachings.&lt;ref&gt;"Esoteric Buddhism in Southeast Asia in the Light of Recent Scholarship" by Hiram Woodward.

====Reign of Parakramabahu I====
[[File:Gal Viharaya 02.jpg|thumb|Parakramabahu I commissioned various religious projects such as [[Gal Vihara]] ('The Stone Shrine') in [[Polonnaruwa]] features three statues of the Buddha in three different poses carved from the same large rock.]]
The trend of the Abhayagiri Vihara being a dominant sect changed in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century, when the Mahāvihāra sect gained the political support of [[Parakramabahu&amp;nbsp;I]] (1153–1186), who completely abolished the Abhayagiri and Jetavanin traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirakawa|first1=Akira|last2=Groner|first2=Paul|title=A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XjjwjC7rcOYC|year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0955-0|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams, Duncan 1999. p. 134"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Queen|first1=Christopher S.|last2=Williams|first2=Duncan Ryuken|title=American Buddhism: Methods and Findings in Recent Scholarship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZiMAQAAQBAJ|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-83033-4|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravāda monks of these two traditions were defrocked and given the choice of either returning to the laity permanently, or attempting reordination under the Mahāvihāra tradition as "novices" (''[[Śrāmaṇera|{{IAST|sāmaṇera}}]]'').&lt;ref name="Williams, Duncan 1999. p. 134" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Richard.

{{quote|Though the chronicle says that he reunited the Sangha, this expression glosses over the fact that what he did was to abolish the Abhayagiri and Jetavana Nikāyas. He laicized many monks from the Mahā Vihāra Nikāya, all the monks in the other two – and then allowed the better ones among the latter to become novices in the now 'unified' Sangha, into which they would have in due course to be reordained.}}

It seems that part of the reason for these radical moves was that [[Parakramabahu I]] saw the Sangha as being divided, corrupt and in need of reform, especially the Abhayagiri.&lt;ref&gt;Paranavitana, ''History of Ceylon'', p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Culavamsa|{{IAST|Cūḷavaṁsa}}]]'' laments that at this time Theravada monks had "turned away in their demeanor from one another and took delight in all kinds of strife".&lt;ref&gt;Sujato, Bhikkhu. ''Sects &amp; Sectarianism: The Origins of Buddhist Schools.'' 2006. p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; This chronicle also claims that many monks in the Sri Lankan Sangha had even begun to marry and have children, behaving more like lay followers than monastics.&lt;ref&gt;Culavamsa, LXXVIII, 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; Parākramabāhu's chief monastic leader in these reforms was [[Thero|Mahathera]] Kassapa, an experienced monk well versed in the [[Tripiṭaka|Scriptures]] and the [[Vinaya|Monastic discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;Culavamsa, LXXVIII, 7&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Parakramabahu I]] is also known for rebuilding the ancient cities of [[Anuradhapura]] and [[Polonnaruwa]], restoring Buddhist [[stupas]] and [[Viharas]] (monasteries).&lt;ref name="short history"&gt;Perera, HR; Buddhism in Sri Lanka A Short History,  Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy, Sri Lanka, page&lt;/ref&gt; He appointed a [[Sangharaja]], or "King of the Sangha", a monk who would preside over the Sangha and its ordinations in Sri Lanka, assisted by two deputies.&lt;ref name="Gombrich, Richard 1988. p. 159"/&gt; The reign of Parakkamabāhu also saw a flowering of Theravada scholasticism with the work of prominent Sri Lankan scholars such as Anuruddha, [[Sāriputta Thera]], [[Mahākassapa Thera]] of [[Dimbulagala Raja Maha Vihara|Dimbulagala Vihara]] and Moggallana Thera.&lt;ref name="short history" /&gt; They worked on compiling of [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|subcommentaries on the Tipitaka]], texts on grammar, summaries and textbooks on Abhidhamma and Vinaya such as the influential [[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]] of Anuruddha.

According to the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', a Sri Lankan chronicle, after the conclusion of the [[Third Buddhist council]], a mission was sent to [[Suvarnabhumi]], led by two monks, Sona and Uttara.&lt;ref&gt;''Mahavamsa: The great chronicle of Ceylon'' tr. [[Wilhelm Geiger]]. Pali Text Society, 1912, Page 82 and 86&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly opinions differ as to where exactly this land of Suvarnabhumi was located, but it is generally believed to have been located somewhere in the area of [[Lower Burma]], [[Thailand]], the [[Malay Peninsula]], or [[Sumatra]]. Before the 12th century, the areas of [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[Laos]], and [[Cambodia]] were dominated by Buddhist sects from India, and included the teachings of Mahāyāna Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Sujato, Bhikkhu 2006. p. 72"&gt;Sujato, Bhikkhu.

Though there are some early accounts that have been interpreted as Theravāda in Myanmar, the surviving records show that most Burmese Buddhism incorporated Mahāyāna, and used [[Sanskrit]] rather than [[Pali]].&lt;ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 131" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Huston Smith|Smith, Huston]] &amp; [[Philip Novak|Novak, Philip]].

''Theravāda Buddhism: A Social History''. 1988. p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[decline of Buddhism in India]], missions of monks from Sri Lanka gradually converted [[Buddhism in Myanmar|Burmese Buddhism]] to Theravāda, and in the next two centuries also brought Theravāda Buddhism to the areas of Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia, where it supplanted previous forms of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Richard Francis. ''Theravāda Buddhism: A Social History''. 1988. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mon people|Mon]] and [[Pyu]] were among the earliest people to inhabit Myanmar. The oldest surviving Buddhist texts in the Pali language come from [[Pyu city-states|Pyu city-state]] of [[Sri Ksetra]], the text which is dated from the mid 5th to mid 6th century is written on twenty-leaf manuscript of solid gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Professor Janice Stargardt|title=Historical Geography of Burma: Creation of enduring patterns in the Pyu period|publisher= IIAS Newsletter Online, No 25, Theme Burmese Heritage|url=http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/25/theme/25T6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Skilling concludes that there is firm evidence for the dominant presence of Theravada in "the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] and [[Chao Phraya]] basins, from about the 5th century CE onwards", though he adds that evidence shows that [[Mahayana]] was also present.&lt;ref&gt;Skilling, Peter.

The Burmese slowly became Theravādin as they came into contact and conquered the Pyu and Mon civilizations. This began in the 11th century during the reign of the Bamar king [[Anawrahta]] (1044–1077) of the [[Pagan Kingdom]] who acquired the Pali scriptures in a war against the Mon as well as from Sri Lanka and build stupas and monasteries at his capital of [[Bagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lieberman|first=Victor B|title=Strange Parallels: Southeast Asia in Global Context, c. 800–1830, Volume 1: Integration on the Mainland|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80496-7|pages=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various invasions of Burma by neighboring states and the [[Mongol invasions of Burma (disambiguation)|Mongol invasions of Burma]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; (13th century) damaged the Burmese sangha and Theravada had to be reintroduced several times into the country from Sri Lanka and Thailand.

==== Cambodia and Thailand ====
[[File:CambodgePhnomPenhNaga.JPG|thumb|Stairway to [[Wat Phnom]] guarded by [[Nāga|Nagas]], the oldest Buddhist structure at the Cambodian capital of [[Phnom Penh]].]]
[[File:201312131121c HL ps Sukothai, Wat Mahathat.jpg|thumb|[[Sukhothai Historical Park]], Thailand.]]
The [[Khmer Empire]] (802–1431) centered in [[Cambodia]] was initially dominated by [[Hinduism]]; Hindu ceremonies and rituals were performed by [[Brahmins]], usually only held among ruling elites of the king's family, nobles, and the ruling class. Tantric [[Mahayana Buddhism]] was also a prominent faith, promoted by Buddhist emperors such as [[Jayavarman VII]] (1181–1215) who rejected the Hindu gods and presented himself as a Bodhisattva King.

During his reign, King [[Jayavarman VII]] (c. 1181–1218) sent his son Tamalinda to Sri Lanka to be ordained as a Buddhist monk and study Theravada Buddhism according to the Pali scriptural traditions in the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahavihara]] monastery. Tamalinda then returned to Cambodia and promoted Buddhist traditions according to the Theravada training he had received, galvanizing and energizing the long-standing Theravada presence that had existed throughout the Angkor empire for centuries. During the 13th and 14th centuries, Theravada monks from Sri Lanka continued introducing orthodox Theravada Buddhism which eventually became the dominant faith among all classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Keyes1995|Keyes, 1995]], pp. 78–82&lt;/ref&gt; The monasteries replaced the local priestly classes, becoming centers of religion, education, culture and social service for Cambodian villages. This change in [[Buddhism in Cambodia|Cambodian Buddhism]] led to high levels of literacy among Cambodians.&lt;ref&gt;Gyallay-Pap, Peter. "Notes of the Rebirth of Khmer Buddhism", ''Radical Conservativism''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand, Theravada existed alongside Mahayana and other religious sects before the rise of [[Sukhothai Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Prapod Assavavirulhakarn. ''The Ascendancy of Theravada Buddhism in Southeast Asia''. Chiang Mai: Silkworm Books, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of King [[Ram Khamhaeng]] (c. 1237/1247 – 1298) Theravada was made the main state religion and promoted by the king as the orthodox form of [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhism]].

Despite its success in Southeast Asia, Theravāda Buddhism in China has generally been limited to areas bordering Theravāda countries.

===Tantric and esoteric innovations===
{{main article|Tantric Theravada}}
During the pre-modern era, Southeast Asian Buddhism included numerous elements which could be called [[Tantra|tantric]] and [[Esotericism|esoteric]] (such as the use of [[Mantra|mantras]] and [[Yantra|yantras]] in elaborate rituals). The French scholar [[François Bizot]] has called this "[[Tantric Theravada]]", and his textual studies show that it was a major tradition in Cambodia and Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;Cousins, L.S. (1997), "Aspects of Southern Esoteric Buddhism"&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these practices are still prevalent in Cambodia and Laos today.

Later Theravada textual materials show new and somewhat unorthodox developments in theory and practice. These developments include what has been called the "Yogāvacara tradition" associated with the Sinhalese [[Yogāvacara's manual]] (c. 16th to 17th centuries) and also [[Tantric Theravada|Esoteric Theravada]] also known as ''Borān kammaṭṭhāna'' ('ancient practices'). These traditions include new practices and ideas which are not included in classical orthodox Theravada works like the [[Visuddhimagga]], such as the use of [[mantras]] (such as ''Araham''), the practice of magical formulas, complex rituals and complex visualization exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Cousins, L.S. (1997), "Aspects of Southern Esoteric Buddhism", in Peter Connolly and Sue Hamilton (eds.), ''Indian Insights: Buddhism, Brahmanism and Bhakd Papers from the Annual Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions'', Luzac Oriental, London: 185–207, 410. {{ISBN|1-898942-153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, Kate (2000). "Tantric Theravada: A Bibliographic Essay on the Writings of Francois Bizot and others on the Yogavacara-Tradition", ''Contemporary Buddhism'' 1 (2), 141–198&lt;/ref&gt; These practices were particularly prominent in the [[Siam Nikaya]] before the modernist reforms of King [[Rama IV]] (1851–1868) as well as in [[Sri Lanka]].

===Modernisation and spread to the West===
{{See also|Buddhist modernism|Vipassana movement}}
[[File:Olcott and Buddhists.jpg|thumb|250px|Henry Olcott and Buddhists (Colombo, 1883).]]
In the 19th century began a process of mutual influence of both Asian Buddhists and Hinduists, and a Western audience interested in ancient wisdom. Theravada was also influenced by this process, which lead to Buddhist modernism; especially [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott]], founders of the [[Theosophical Society]], had a profound role in this process in Sri Lanka. Simultaneously, ''vipassana''-meditation was re-invented, and in Theravāda countries a lay vipassana practice developed. This took a high flight in East Asia from the 1950s onwards with the ''vipassana''-movement, and from the 1970s also in the west, with western students who popularized ''vipassana''-meditation in the west,{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} giving way to the development and popularisation of mindfulness-practice.{{sfn|Wilson|2014}}

====Reaction against Western colonialism====
Buddhist revivalism has also reacted against changes in Buddhism caused by colonialist regimes. [[Western colonialism|Western colonialists]] and [[Christian mission|Christian missionaries]] deliberately imposed a particular type of Christian monasticism on Buddhist clergy in Sri Lanka and colonies in Southeast Asia, restricting monks' activities to individual purification and temple ministries.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund F. Perry's introduction to Walpola Rahula's ''The Heritage of the Bhikkhu: A Short History of the Bhikkhu in the Educational, Cultural, Social, and Policital Life.'' Grove Press, New York, 1974, page xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to [[British Empire|British colonial]] control, monks in both Sri Lanka and Burma had been responsible for the education of the children of lay people, and had produced large bodies of literature. After the British takeover, Buddhist temples were strictly administered and were only permitted to use their funds on strictly religious activities. Christian ministers were given control of the education system and their pay became state funding for missions.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, ''Buddhism Betrayed?'' The University of Chicago Press, 1992, pages 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign, especially British, rule had an enervating effect on the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].&lt;ref name="Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah 1992, page 28"&gt;Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, ''Buddhism Betrayed?'' The University of Chicago Press, 1992, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Walpola Rahula]], Christian missionaries displaced and appropriated the educational, social, and welfare activities of the monks, and inculcated a permanent shift in views regarding the proper position of monks in society through their institutional influence upon the elite.&lt;ref name="Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah 1992, page 28"/&gt; Many monks in post-colonial times have dedicated themselves to undoing these changes.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, ''Buddhism Betrayed?'' The University of Chicago Press, 1992, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Movements intending to restore Buddhism's place in society have developed in both Sri Lanka and Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, ''Buddhism Betrayed?'' The University of Chicago Press, 1992, pages 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of the reaction against Western colonialism has been a modernization of Theravāda Buddhism: Western elements have been incorporated, and [[meditation]] practice has opened to a lay audience. Modernized forms of Theravādan practice have spread to the West.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}

====Sri Lanka====
{{See also|Buddhism in Sri Lanka}}
[[File:Zahntempel Kandy.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Temple of the Tooth]] was renovated during the Buddhist revival.]]
In [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka Theravadins]] were looking at Western culture to find means to revitalize their own tradition. Christian missionaries were threatening the indigenous culture.{{sfn|Gombrich|1996|p=177–181}} As a reaction to this, Theravadins became active in spreading Buddhism and debating Christians. They were aided by the [[Theosophical Society]], who were dedicated to the search for wisdom within ancient sources. [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] was one of the Theravāda leaders with whom the Theosophists sided. Dharmapala reached out to the middle classes, offering them religious practice and a religious identity, which were used to withstand the British imperialists. As a result of Dharmapala's efforts, lay practitioners started to practise meditation and study Buddhism, which had been reserved specifically for the monks.{{sfn|Gombrich|1996|p=172–197}}

The translation and publication of the Pāli Canon by the [[Pali Text Society]] made the Pali Canon better available to a lay audience, not only in the West, but also in the East. Western lay interest in Theravāda Buddhism was promoted by the Theosophical Society, and endured until the beginning of the 20th century. During the 1970s interest rose again, leading to a surge of Westerners searching for enlightenment, and the republishing of the Pāli Canon, first in print, and later on the internet.

====Myanmar====
{{See also|Buddhism in Myanmar}}
[[File:Chattha Sangāyana.jpg|thumb|Convening of the Sixth Buddhist council at the Great Cave.]]

An influential modernist figure in Myanmar Buddhism was king [[Mindon Min]] (1808–1878). He promoted the [[Fifth Buddhist council]] (1871) and inscribed the Pali canon into marble slabs, creating the [[world's largest book]] in 1868. During his reign, various reformist sects came into being such as the Dwaya and the Shwegyin, who advocated a stricter monastic conduct than the mainstream Thudhamma tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Swearer, Donald K. The Buddhist World of Southeast Asia: Second Edition, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; During colonial Burma, there were constant tensions between Christian missionaries and Buddhist monks (which included one of the first Western convert monks, [[U Dhammaloka]]). After independence, Myanmar was also the place for the [[Sixth Buddhist council]] ([[Vesak]] 1954 to Vesak 1956) which was attended by monks from eight Theravada nations to recite the Pali Canon. The Council synthesized a new redaction of the Pali texts ultimately transcribed into several native scripts. In Myanmar, this ''Chaṭṭha Saṅgīti Piṭaka'' (Sixth council Pitaka) was published by the government in 40 volumes.

Modern [[vipassanā]] meditation practice was re-invented in Myanmar in the 19th century. The "New Burmese method" was developed by [[U Nārada]] and popularized by his student [[Mahasi Sayadaw]] and [[Nyanaponika Thera]]. Another prominent teacher is [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], a student of Nyanaponika. The New Burmese Method strongly emphasizes vipassanā over [[samatha]]. It is regarded by traditionalists as a simplification of traditional Buddhist meditation techniques, suitable not only for monks but also for lay practitioners. The method has been popularized in the West by teachers of the [[vipassana movement]] such as [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]], [[Jack Kornfield]], [[Tara Brach]], [[Gil Fronsdal]] and [[Sharon Salzberg]].

The Ledi lineage begins with [[Ledi Sayadaw]].{{sfn|Chapman|2011}} [[S. N. Goenka]] is a well-known teacher in the Ledi-lineage. According to S. N. Goenka, vipassana techniques are essentially nonsectarian in character, and have universal application. Meditation centers teaching the vipassanā popularized by S. N. Goenka exist now in India, Asia, North and South America, Europe, Australia, Middle East and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index|title=Vipassana Meditation|website=www.dhamma.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thailand and Cambodia====
{{See also|Buddhism in Thailand|Buddhism in Cambodia}}
[[File:Mongkut in the Sangha.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|From 1824 – 1851 Prince [[Mongkut]] spent his life as a monk.]]

With the coming to power in 1851 of King [[Mongkut]], who had been a monk himself for twenty-seven years, the sangha, like the kingdom, became steadily more centralized and hierarchical, and its links to the state more institutionalized. Mongkut was a distinguished scholar of Pali Buddhist scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Swearer, Donald K. The Buddhist World of Southeast Asia: Second Edition, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, at that time the immigration of numbers of monks from Burma was introducing the more rigorous discipline characteristic of the Mon sangha. Influenced by the Mon and guided by his own understanding of the Tipitaka, Mongkut began a reform movement that later became the basis for the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]]. Mongkut advocated a stricter adherence to the [[Vinaya]] (monastic discipline). He also emphasized study of the scriptures, and rationalism.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Swearer, Donald K. The Buddhist World of Southeast Asia: Second Edition, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Chulalongkorn|King Chulalongkorn]] created a national structure for Buddhist monastics and established a nationwide system of monastic education.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

In the early 1900s, Thailand's [[Ajahn Sao Kantasīlo]] and his student, [[Mun Bhuridatta]], led the [[Thai Forest Tradition]] revival movement. In the 20th century notable practitioners included [[Ajahn Thate]], [[Ajahn Maha Bua]] and [[Ajahn Chah]].{{sfn|Tiyavanich|1997}} It was later spread globally by Ajahn Mun's students including Ajahn Thate, Ajahn Maha Bua and Ajahn Chah and several Western disciples, among whom the most senior is ''[[Luang Por]]'' [[Ajahn Sumedho]].

Modern Buddhism in Cambodia was strongly influenced by Thai Buddhism. The [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]] was introduced into the country during the reign of King [[Norodom]] (1834–1904) and benefited from royal patronage. &lt;ref&gt;Harris, Ian (August 2001), "Sangha Groupings in Cambodia", Buddhist Studies Review, UK Association for Buddhist Studies, 18 (I): 65–72&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of the [[Khmer Rouge]] effectively destroyed Cambodia's Buddhist institutions by disrobing and killing monks and destroying temples.&lt;ref name="Harris 2001 p=74"&gt;{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the regime the Sangha was re-established. An important figure of modern Cambodian Theravada is [[Maha Ghosananda]] who promoted a form of [[engaged Buddhism]] to effect social change.

===Pali Canon===
{{Main article|Pali Canon}}
[[File:Kyauksa.JPG|thumb|upright|One of the 729 large marble tablets of the Pali Canon (the [[world's largest book]]) inscribed using the [[Burmese alphabet]] at the [[Kuthodaw Pagoda]] in [[Mandalay]], Myanmar. ]]

According to Kate Crosby, for Theravada, the Pali Canon is "the highest authority on what constitutes the Dhamma (the truth or teaching of the Buddha) and the organization of the Sangha (the community of monks and nuns)."&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Sūtra|Sutta]] and [[Vinaya]] portion of the Tipitaka shows considerable overlap in content to the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]], the parallel collections used by non-Theravāda schools in India which are preserved in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and partially in [[Sanskrit]], [[Prakrit]], and [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], and the various non-Theravāda Vinayas. On this basis, both these sets of texts are generally believed to be the oldest and most authoritative texts on [[pre-sectarian Buddhism]] by scholars. It is also believed that much of the Pali Canon, which is still used by Theravāda communities, was transmitted to [[Sri Lanka]] during the reign of [[Ashoka]]. After being orally transmitted (as was the custom in those days for religious texts) for some centuries, were finally committed to writing in the last century BCE, at what the Theravāda usually reckons as the fourth council, in [[Sri Lanka]]. Theravāda is one of the first Buddhist schools to commit the whole complete set of its Buddhist canon into writing.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, ''Introduction to Buddhism'', Cambridge University Press, 1990, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the material in the Canon is not specifically "Theravādan", but is instead the collection of teachings that this school preserved from the early, non-sectarian body of teachings. According to Peter Harvey: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Theravādans, then, may have ''added'' texts to the Canon for some time, but they do not appear to have tampered with what they already had from an earlier period.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind.'' Curzon Press, 1995, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Pali Tipitaka consists of three parts: the [[Vinaya Pitaka]], [[Sutta Pitaka]] and [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]]. Of these, the Abhidhamma Pitaka is believed to be a later addition to the first two pitakas, which, in the opinion of many scholars, were the only two pitakas at the time of the [[First Buddhist Council]].  The Pali Abhidhamma was not recognized outside the Theravāda school.

The Tipitaka is composed of 45 volumes in the Thai edition, 40 in the Burmese and 58 in the Sinhalese, and a full set of the Tipitaka is usually kept in its own (medium-sized) cupboard.

=== ''Vinaya'' (monastic discipline) and ''Abhidhamma'' ===
According to Kate Crosby:&lt;blockquote&gt;Since much Sutta material overlaps with that found in the Sūtra collections of other Buddhist traditions, it is the Vinaya (monastic discipline) and Abhidhamma that are the most distinctive formal aspects of Theravada Buddhism, unique to Theravada.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The [[Vibhajyavāda|Vibhajjavāda]] school (‘the analysts’), the branch of the [[Sthavira nikāya|Sthāvira]] school from which Theravāda is derived, differed from other [[early Buddhist schools]] on a variety of teachings.{{sfn|Dutt|1998|pp=211–217}} The differences resulted from the systematization of the Buddhist teachings, which was preserved in the [[Abhidharma]]s of the various schools.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=217}} The unique doctrinal positions of the Theravāda school are expounded in what is known as the [[Abhidhamma|Abhidhamma-piṭaka]], as well as in the later [[Pali]] commentaries ([[Atthakatha|''Aṭṭha-kathā'']]) and sub-commentaries (''ṭīkā''). Because of the size of this canonical and commentarial literature the Pali tradition developed a tradition of handbooks and doctrinal summaries, the most influential of which are the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' and the ''[[Abhidhammattha-sangaha|Abhidhammaṭṭhasaṅgaha]].''&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;      

The Pali [[Abhidhamma]] is "a restatement of the doctrine of the Buddha in strictly formalized language ... assumed to constitute a consistent system of philosophy".{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=288}} Its aim is not the empirical verification of the Buddhist teachings,{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=288}} but "to set forth the correct interpretation of the Buddha's statements in the ''Sutra'' to restate his 'system' with perfect accuracy".{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=288}} Because Abhidhamma focuses on analyzing the internal lived experience of beings and the intentional structure of consciousness, the system has often been compared to a kind of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] [[psychology]] by numerous scholars such as [[Nyanaponika Thera|Nyanaponika]], [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] and [[Alexander Piatigorsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa, Early Buddhist Metaphysics: The Making of a Philosophical Tradition (Routledge curzon Critical Studies in Buddhism) 2011, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Theravāda school has traditionally held the doctrinal position that the canonical [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]] was actually taught by the Buddha himself.&lt;ref&gt;James P. McDermott, Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume VII: Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 A.D. p. 80. &lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholarship in contrast, has generally held that the Abhidhamma texts date from the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;"Abhidhamma Pitaka." Encyclopædia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However some scholars, such as [[Erich Frauwallner|Frauwallner]], also hold that the early Abhidhamma texts developed out of [[Exegesis|exegetical]] and [[Catechesis|catechetical]] work which made use of doctrinal lists which can be seen in the suttas, called ''matikas.''&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa, Early Buddhist Metaphysics: The Making of a Philosophical Tradition (Routledge curzon Critical Studies in Buddhism) 2011, p. 27-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frauwallner, Erich. Kidd, Sophie Francis (translator). Steinkellner, Ernst (editor). Studies in Abhidharma Literature and the Origins of Buddhist Philosophical Systems. SUNY Press. Pages 18, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Non-canonical literature===
{{Main article|Pali literature}}

In the 4th or 5th century [[Buddhaghosa]] Thera, wrote the first [[Atthakatha|Pali commentaries]] to much of the [[Tripiṭaka|Tipitaka]] (which were based on much older manuscripts, mostly in old Sinhalese), including commentaries on the [[Nikāya|Nikayas]] and his commentary on the [[Vinaya]], the ''Samantapāsādikā''. Buddhaghosa wrote as part of the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahavihara]] tradition in Sri Lanka, a tradition which came to dominate the island and all of Theravāda after the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

After him many other monks wrote various texts which have become part of the Theravāda heritage. These texts do not have the same authority as the Tipitaka does, though Buddhaghosas ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' is a cornerstone of the commentarial tradition.

Another important genre of Theravāda literature are shorter handbooks and summaries which serve as introductions and study guides for the larger commentarial works. Two of the more influential summaries are Sariputta Thera's ''Pālimuttakavinayavinicchayasaṅgaha,'' a summary of Buddhaghosa's Vinaya commentary and Anuruddha's ''[[Abhidhammattha-sangaha|Abhidhammaṭṭhasaṅgaha]]'' (Manual of Abhidhamma).&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For many Theravāda Buddhists, the Pali texts and language are symbolically and ritually important, however most people are likely to access Buddhist teachings though vernacular literature, oral teachings, sermons, art and performance as well as films and internet media.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kate Crosby, "there is a far greater volume of Theravada literature in vernacular languages than in Pali."&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important genre of Theravāda literature, in both Pali and vernacular languages are the [[Jataka tales|Jataka]] tales, stories of the Buddha's past lives. They are very popular among all classes and are rendered in a wide variety of media formats, from cartoons to high literature. The  [[Vessantara Jataka|Vessantara Jātaka]] is one of the most popular of these.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theravāda Buddhists consider much of what is found in the Chinese and Tibetan Mahāyāna scriptural collections to be apocryphal, meaning that they are not authentic words of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', 2004 (Volume Two), page 756&lt;/ref&gt;

Theravāda traditionally promotes itself as the [[Vibhajyavāda|Vibhajjavāda]] "teaching of analysis". This doctrine says that insight must come from the aspirant's experience, application of knowledge, and critical reasoning. However, the scriptures of the Theravadin tradition also emphasize heeding the advice of the wise, considering such advice and evaluation of one's own experiences to be the two tests by which practices should be judged.{{source?|date=November 2018}} Yet, in its actual praxis, according to Braun, "the majority of Theravadins and dedicated Buddhists of other traditions, including monks and nuns, have focused on cultivating moral behavior, preserving the Buddha’s teachings (dharma), and acquiring the good karma that comes from generous giving."&lt;ref group=web name="Braun2014/&gt; 

===Core doctrines===
The core of Theravāda doctrine is contained in the [[Pāli Canon|Pali Canon]], the only complete collection of [[Early Buddhist Texts|Early Buddhist texts]] surviving in a classical [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic language]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, In the Buddha's words, p 13&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas are shared by other [[Early Buddhist schools]] as well as by [[Mahayana]] traditions. They include central concepts such as:

* The [[Middle Way]]
*[[Four Noble Truths|The four noble truths]]
*[[Noble Eightfold Path|The Noble Eightfold Path]]
*[[Three marks of existence]] ([[impermanence]], [[Dukkha|suffering]], [[Anatta|not-self]])
*[[Skandha|Five aggregates]]
*[[Pratītyasamutpāda|Dependent arising]]
*[[Karma in Buddhism|Karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]
*[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|Jhana]]
*[[Bodhipakkhiyādhammā|The Bodhipakkhiyādhammā]] (37 factors conducive to awakening)
*[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|Kleshas (mental defilements)]] and [[Asava|asavas]]
*[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|Avidyā (Ignorance)]]
*[[Nirvana]]

=== Dhamma theory ===
In the Pali Nikayas, the Buddha teaches through a method in which experience is explained using various conceptual groupings of physical and mental processes, which are called dhammas. Examples of lists of dhammas taught by the Buddha include the twelve sense 'spheres' or [[Ayatana|ayatanas]], the [[Skandha|five aggregates]] or khanda and the eighteen elements of cognition or [[Skandha#Eighteen Dhātus|dhatus]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Expanding this model, the Pali Abhidhamma concerned itself with analyzing "[[Two truths doctrine|ultimate truth]]" (''paramattha-sacca'') which it sees as being composed of ''all possible'' dhammas and their relationships. The central theory of the Pali [[Abhidharma|Abhidhamma]] is thus known as the "[[Dhamma theory]]".&lt;ref name="Karunadasa"&gt;Y. Karunadasa, ''The Dhamma Theory Philosophical Cornerstone of the Abhidhamma'', Buddhist Publication Society Kandy, Sri Lanka, http://www.bps.lk/olib/wh/wh412_Karunadasa_Dhamma-Theory--Philosophical-Cornerstone-of-Abhidhamma.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa, Early Buddhist Metaphysics: The Making of a Philosophical Tradition (Routledge curzon Critical Studies in Buddhism) 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Characteristics====
"Dhamma" has been translated as "factors" (Collett Cox), "psychic characteristics" (Bronkhorst), "psycho-physical events" (Noa Ronkin) and  "phenomena" ([[Nyanaponika Thera]]).&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Buswell, Jaini; Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies Volume VII Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 AD, page 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, Kate (2013), ''Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Dhammas are defined by the Theravada commentary, the [[Atthasālinī|Atthasalini]], as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dhammas bear their own particular natures ([[Svabhava|''sabhāva'']]). Alternatively, dhammas are borne by conditions, or according to particular natures.&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Y. Karunadasa, a dhamma, which can be translated as "a 'principle' or 'element' (''dharma'')", is "those items that result when the process of analysis is taken to its ultimate limits".&lt;ref name="Karunadasa" /&gt; However, this does not mean that they have an independent existence, for it is "only for the purposes of description" that they are postulated.&lt;ref&gt;Karunadasa, Y. Buddhist Analysis of Matter, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Noa Ronkin defines dhammas as "the constituents of sentient experience; the irreducible ‘building blocks’ that make up one’s world, albeit they are not static mental contents and certainly not substances."&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Noa Ronkin also argues that there was gradual shift from the early canonical texts which tended to explain experience in terms of changing [[Process philosophy|processes]], to the Abhidhamma tradition which analyzed these processes into distinct mental [[Event (philosophy)|events]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, page 70-75.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dhammas are not permanent, discrete and separate entities, they are always in dependently conditioned relationships with other dhammas and always changing, arising and vanishing. It is thus only for the sake of description that they are said to have their "own nature" ([[Svabhava|''sabhāva'']]).&lt;ref&gt;Y. Karunadasa, ''The Dhamma Theory Philosophical Cornerstone of the Abhidhamma'', Buddhist Publication Society Kandy, Sri Lanka, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.bps.lk/olib/wh/wh412_Karunadasa_Dhamma-Theory--Philosophical-Cornerstone-of-Abhidhamma.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, Theravāda commentaries sometimes equate the two terms, such as the [[Visuddhimagga]] which states that ‘dhamma means sabhava’.&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, page 112.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter Harvey, the Theravāda view of a dhamma's [[Svabhava|''sabhāva'']] is that it refers to an individualizing characteristic (''salakkhana'') that "is not something inherent in a dhamma as a separate ultimate reality, but arise due to the supporting conditions both of other dhammas and previous occurrences of that dhamma".&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, in his excellent INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHISM, page 87 wrote:&lt;/ref&gt; Noa Ronkin argues that in Theravāda Abhidhamma, "''sabhava'' is predominantly used for the sake of determining the dhammas’ individuality, not their existential status".&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, page 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Ronkin also adds:&lt;blockquote&gt;the concept of sabhava attests to the Theravadins’ interest in unveiling the nature of conscious experience: this, they presumed, could be carried out by enumerating the possible types of those events constituting one’s experience and by individuating them. To individuate the dhammas the Abhidhammikas had to provide a method for determining what any given dhammic instance of every possible event-type is and what makes it so, and for this purpose they used the concept of sabhava.&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, page 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, while in Theravāda Abhidhamma, dhammas are the ultimate constituents of experience, they are not seen as [[Substance theory|substances]], [[Essence|essences]] or independent particulars, since they are empty ([[Śūnyatā|''suñña'']]) of a self ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|''attā'']]) and conditioned.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, 182.&lt;/ref&gt; This is spelled out in the [[Patisambhidamagga|Patisambhidhamagga]], which states that dhammas are empty of [[svabhava]] (''sabhavena suññam'').&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, page 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ronkin, the canonical Pali Abhidhamma remains pragmatic and psychological, and "does not take much interest in [[ontology]]" in contrast with the [[Sarvastivada]] tradition. Paul Williams also notes that the Abhidhamma remains focused on the practicalities of insight meditation and leaves ontology "relatively unexplored".&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, page 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Ronkin does note however that later Theravāda sub-commentaries (''ṭīkā'') do show a doctrinal shift towards ontological [[Philosophical realism|realism]] from the earlier epistemic and practical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, page 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Classification of dhammas ====
The Theravāda Abhidhamma holds that there is a total of 82 possible types of dhammas, 81 of these are conditioned  ([[sankhata|''sankhata'']]), while one is unconditioned, which is [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nibbana]]. The 81 conditioned dhammas are divided into three broad categories, consciousness ([[citta|''citta'']]), associated mentality ([[Mental factors (Buddhism)|''cetasika'']]) and materiality, or physical phenomena (''rupa'').&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Since no dhamma exists independently, every single dhamma of consciousness, known as a citta, arises associated (''sampayutta'') with at least seven [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors (''cetasikas'')]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Crosby, 2013, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; In Abhidhamma, all awareness events are thus seen as being characterized by [[intentionality]] and never exist in isolation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

Much of Abhidhamma philosophy deals with categorizing the different consciousnesses and their accompanying mental factors as well as their conditioned relationships (''paccaya'').&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] for example, are divided into:

# Universal mental factors (''sabbacittasādhāraṇa cetasikas''), which are basic and rudimentary cognitive functions.
# Occasional or particular mental factors (''pakiṇṇaka cetasikas'').
# Unwholesome mental factors (''akusala cetasikas''), accompanied by one or another of the [[Three poisons|three unwholesome roots]]—greed, hatred, and delusion.
# Beautiful mental factors (''sobhana cetasikas''), accompanied by the wholesome roots—non-greed or generosity, non-hatred or loving-kindness, and non-delusion or wisdom.

=== Two truths ===
According [[Y Karunadasa|Y. Karunadasa]], for the Theravada, the [[Two truths doctrine|two truths theory]] which divides reality into ''sammuti (''worldly conventions) and ''paramattha'' (ultimate, absolute truths) is a doctrinal innovation of the Abhidhamma, but it has its origins in some statements from the early [[Nikāya|Pali Nikayas]]. This can mainly be seen in the distinction made in the [[Anguttara Nikaya|Aṅguttara-nikāya]] between statements (not truths) that are ''nītattha'' (explicit, definitive) and ''neyyattha'' (requiring further explanation).&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;Karunadasa, Y. Theravada Version of the Two Truths&lt;/ref&gt; Karunadasa notes that in the Nikayas, "no preferential value judgment is made between ''nītattha'' and ''neyyattha''. All that is emphasized is that the two kinds of statement should not be confused."&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Another early source of this doctrine is the Saṅgīti-sutta of the [[Digha Nikaya|Dīgha-nikāya]], which lists four kinds of knowledge: (a) the direct knowledge of the doctrine (''dhamme ñāna''), (b) the inductive knowledge of the doctrine (''anvaye ñana''), (c) knowledge of analysis (''paricchede ñana''), and knowledge of (linguistic) conventions (''sammuti-ñana'').&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; However, in the earlier Nikayas, as opposed to the Abhidhamma, ''sammuti'' (linguistic conventions) is not analyzed down into existents called ''paramattha'' (ultimate).&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; In the Theravada Abhidhamma, the distinction does arise, referring to:&lt;blockquote&gt;two levels of reality, namely that which is amenable to analysis and that which defies further analysis. The first level is called sammuti because it represents conventional or relative truth or what is called consensual reality, and the second is called paramattha because it represents the absolute truth or ultimate reality.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, in orthodox Theravada Abhidhamma, when a situation is explained in terms of what cannot be empirically analyzed further into smaller components with different characteristics (''lakkhana'') that explanation is ''paramattha-sacca'' (ultimate truth), and when it is explained in terms of ''what is'' analyzable further due to being dependent on the mind’s synthesizing function (i.e. ''paññatti''), that explanation is ''sammuti-sacca'' (truth by convention), which exists in a relative or conventional sense due to mental conception (''attha-paññatti'') and linguistic construction (''nama-paññatti'').&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; However, even these ultimate components (i.e. ''dhammas'') are [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently originated]], "necessarily co-existent and positionally inseparable (''padesato avinibhoga'')".&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Unlike in the Sanskrit based Buddhist tradition which refer to the conventional truth as ''[[Samvriti|samvrti]]'' (which has the meaning of concealing or covering), the Pali Abhidhamma term ''sammuti'' just means human convention and does not have this connotation of an inferior truth hiding a higher truth.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Therefore, as pointed out by [[K. N. Jayatilleke|K.N. Jayatilleke]], the Theravāda version of two truths "does not imply that what is true in the one sense is false in the other or even that the one kind of truth is superior to the other".&lt;ref&gt;K. N. Jayatilleke, Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; As Karunadasa writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;the distinction between ''sammuti-sacca'' and ''paramattha-sacca'' does not refer to two kinds of truth as such, but to two ways of presenting what is true. Although they are formally introduced as two truths, they are explained as two modes of expressing what is true. They do not represent two degrees of truth, of which one is superior or inferior to the other. Nor do they represent two parallel truths.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Because of this, in Pali Abhidhamma, even ''paramattha-sacca'' is explained through concepts, though the ultimate itself is not a product of the mind's conceptual function (''paññatti''), it cannot be explained without the medium of ''paññatti''.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Furthermore, according to Tse Fu Kuan, the [[Dhammasangani|Dhammasaṅgaṇi]], "does not appear to uphold that dhammas are ultimate realities as against conventional constructs like persons." This text also states that “all dhammas are ways of designation (''paññatti'')”, that “all dhammas are ways of interpretation (''nirutti'')” and that “all dhammas are ways of expression (''adhivacana'')”.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Tse-fu Kuan, Abhidhamma Interpretations of " Persons " (puggala): with Particular Reference to the Aṅguttara Nikāya, J Indian Philos (2015) 43:31–60 DOI 10.1007/s10781-014-9228-5&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the canonical [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]] does not uphold the interpretation of the two truths as referring to primary ontological realities (as seen in the later commentarial Theravada and also in [[Sarvastivada]]).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;   

=== Doctrinal differences with other Buddhist schools ===
The doctrinal stances of the Theravāda school vis-a-vis other [[early Buddhist schools]] is presented in the [[Pali]] text known as the [[Kathavatthu|Kathāvatthu]]''',''' "Points of Controversy", which said to have been compiled by the scholar [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] (ca. 327 – 247 BCE). It includes several [[Buddhist philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Soteriology|soteriological]] matters, including the following.

====View of the Arhat====
Theravadins believe that an awakened [[arhat|arahant]] (lit. ''worthy one'') has an "incorruptible nature", unlike other early Buddhist schools like the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] who believed [[arhat|arahant]]s could regress.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=283}} Theravadins also dispute the idea that an arahant may be lacking in knowledge, or have doubts, or that they could have nocturnal emissions and thus still have some residual fetter of sensuality.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;James P. McDermott, Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume VII: Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 A.D. p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; They also argued against the Uttarapathaka school's view that a layperson could become an arahant and continue to live the household life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== View of the Buddha ====
The Theravāda school rejected the view of the [[Lokottaravāda|Lokottaravada]] schools which held that even the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha's]] conventional speech was supramundane or transcendental.&lt;ref&gt;James P. McDermott, KATHAVATTHU; Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume VII: Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 A.D.&lt;/ref&gt; They also rejected the proto-[[Mahayana]] [[Docetism|docetic]] view of the Vetulyaka school that the Buddha himself did not teach the Dharma, but that it was taught by his magical creation or "phantom" while he himself remained in [[Trāyastriṃśa|Tavatimsa]] Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;James P. McDermott, Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume VII: Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 A.D. p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insight is sudden and perfect====
According to the Theravāda, "progress in understanding comes all at once, 'insight' (''abhisamaya'') does not come 'gradually' (successively – ''anapurva'')", a belief known as [[subitism]].{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=284}} This is reflected in the Theravāda account on the [[four stages of enlightenment]], in which the attainment of the four paths appears suddenly and the defilements are rooted out at once. The same stance is taken in the contemporary [[vipassana movement]], especially the "New Burmese Method".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==== Philosophy of time ====
On the [[Philosophy of time]], the Theravāda tradition holds to [[philosophical presentism]], the view that only present moment dhammas exist, against the [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalist]] view of the [[Sarvāstivādin]] tradition which held that dhammas exist in all three times - past, present, future.&lt;ref&gt;[[K. L. Dhammajoti]], Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma, page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Theravadins who compiled the [[Kathavatthu|Kathāvatthu]] also rejected the doctrine of momentariness (Skt., ''kṣāṇavāda'', Pali, ''khāṇavāda'') upheld by other Buddhist Abhidharma schools like the Sarvastivada, which held that all dhammas lasted for a "moment" which for them meant an atomistic unit of time, that is the shortest possible slice of time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ronkin, Noa, Early Buddhist Metaphysics: The Making of a Philosophical Tradition (Routledge curzon Critical Studies in Buddhism) 2011, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Noa Ronkin, the Theravadins meanwhile, used the term "moment" (''khāṇa'') as a simple expression for a "short while", "the dimension of which is not fixed but may be determined by the context".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the ''Khanikakatha'' of the [[Kathavatthu]], the Theravadins also argue that "only mental phenomena are momentary, whereas material phenomena endure for a stretch of time".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

====  Rebirth and Bhavanga ====
Regarding the mechanisms of [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], orthodox Theravadins following the [[Kathavatthu]], rejected the doctrine of the [[Antarabhāva|intermediate state]] (''antarabhāva'') between death and rebirth, holding instead that rebirth is immediate.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex, Buddhist Insight: Essays, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1984 p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; However, recently some Theravada monks have written in favor of the idea, such as Ven. [[Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero|Balangoda Ananda Maitreya]]. &lt;ref&gt;Langer, Rita, Buddhist Rituals of Death and Rebirth: Contemporary Sri Lankan Practice and Its Origins, 2007, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of the [[Bhavanga]] ("ground of becoming", "condition for existence") is an innovation of the Theravāda Abhidhamma, where it is a passive mode of consciousness (''citta''). According to [[Rupert Gethin]], it is "the state in which the mind is said to rest when no active consciousness process is occurring", such as in deep dreamless sleep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shin-ibs.edu/documents/bForum/v3/02Gethin.pdf Gethin, Bhavaṅga and Rebirth According to the Abhidhamma]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said to be a process which conditions the future rebirth consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shin-ibs.edu/documents/bForum/v3/02Gethin.pdf Gethin, Bhavaṅga and Rebirth According to the Abhidhamma]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rupa (the physical) ====
Orthodox Theravada's position on the nature of the physical (''rupa'') is that it is one of the two main [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently originated]] processes of a person (as part of the mind-body complex called ''[[Namarupa|nama-rupa]]''). However there is no dualism between these two, they are merely clusters of interacting processes, each depending on the other.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Harvey, Peter; The mind-body relationship in Pali Buddhism: A philosophical investigation, Asian Philosophy, Vol. 3 No. 1 1993, pp.29-41&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by [[Buddhaghosa]] ([[Visuddhimagga|Vism]]. 596), each can only occur "supported by" (''nissaya'') the other, they are like a blind man that carries a crippled man, or two sheaves of reeds which lean on each other and support each other.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  

Rupa is mainly defined in terms of the four [[Mahābhūta|''mahabhuta'']], the four 'primary' physical phenomena: solidity (literally 'earth'), cohesion (literally 'water'), heat (literally 'fire') and motion (literally 'air').&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In the Pali Abhidhamma, the four primaries began to refer to the irreducible factors or data that make up the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;Karunadasa, Y. Buddhist Analysis of Matter, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; These basic phenomena come together to make up secondary physical phenomena, such as the sense organs. Thus, according to [[Y Karunadasa]], Pali Buddhism does not [[External world scepticism|deny the existence of the external world]] and thus is a kind of [[Realism (philosophical)|realism]]. However, Theravada also follows the view that rupa, like all skandhas, is void (''[[Śūnyatā|suñña]]''), empty (''ritta'') and essence-less (''asara'').&lt;ref&gt;Karunadasa, Y. Buddhist Analysis of Matter, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Rupa dhammas are thus not atomic ontological substances and are merely outlined as a pragmatic descriptions of the world of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Karunadasa, Y. Buddhist Analysis of Matter, p. 14, 172; "If we base ourselves on the Pali Nikayas, then we should be compelled to conclude that Buddhism is realistic. There is no explicit denial anywhere of the external world. Nor is there any positive evidence to show that the world is mind-made or simply a projection of subjective thoughts. That Buddhism recognizes the extra-mental existence of matter and the external world is clearly suggested by the texts. Throughout the discourses it is the language of realism that one encounters. The whole Buddhist practical doctrine and discipline, which has the attainment of Nibbana as its final goal, is based on the recognition of the material world and the conscious living beings living therein."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Karunadasa, this steers a middle course between the view that "all is an absolute unity" (''sabbam ekattam'') and that it is absolute separateness (''sabbam puthuttam'').&lt;ref&gt;Karunadasa, Y. Buddhist Analysis of Matter, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to Noa Ronkin, Theravada Abhidhamma:&lt;blockquote&gt;did not incorporate the Northern [[Buddhist atomism|Buddhist atomistic]] theory as such into their system. As Karunadasa indicates, the Theravadin canonical texts do not mention the idea of a unitary atom or the term [[paramanu]]. Rather, the post-canonical texts employ the term [[Kalapa (atomism)|kalapa]] (literally ‘package’), which corresponds to the collective atom of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivada-Vaibhasika]], that is, the smallest material unit that contains the eight elements.&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Furthermore the term kalapa for the collective atom only became standard in the sub-commentarial literature and it is not a singular particle, but a collection of ''rupa-dhammas'', which are inseparable from each other and always occur simultaneously (''sahajata'').&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, page 58.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Modern trends ===
The modern era saw new developments in Theravada scholarship due to the influence of Western thought. As Donald K Swearer writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Although monastic education is still grounded in the study of Buddhist texts, doctrine, and the Pali language, the curricula of monastic colleges and universities also reflect subject matter and disciplines associated with Western education.&lt;ref&gt;Swearer, Donald K. The Buddhist World of Southeast Asia: Second Edition, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Buddhist modernism|Buddhist modernist]] trends can be traced to figures like [[Anagarika Dharmapala|Anagarika Dhammapala]] and King [[Mongkut]].&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, David L. 2008. The Making of Buddhist Modernism. Oxford: Oxford University Press. page 91-97.&lt;/ref&gt; They promoted a form of Buddhism that was compatible with rationalism and science, and opposed to superstition. [[Walpola Rahula Thero|Walpola Rahula]]’s, [[What the Buddha Taught]] is seen by scholars as an introduction to modernist Buddhist thought and this book continues to be widely used in universities.&lt;ref&gt;Swearer, Donald K. The Buddhist World of Southeast Asia: Second Edition, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Another phenomenon is Buddhist philosophers educated in the West, such as [[K. N. Jayatilleke]] (a student of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]) and [[Hammalawa Saddhatissa]], going on to write modern works on [[Buddhist philosophy]] (''Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge'', 1963 and ''Buddhist Ethics'', 1987 respectively). 

The colonial clash with Christianity also led to debates (such as the [[Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera#Panadura Debate පානදුරාවාදය|Panadura debate]]) and doctrinal works written in defense of Buddhism or attacking Christian ideas, such as Gunapala Dharmasiri's ''A Buddhist critique of the Christian concept of God'' (1988).

Another development has been modern literature promoting socially [[Engaged Buddhism]] and [[Buddhist economics]] from thinkers such as [[Buddhadasa]], [[Sulak Sivaraksa]], [[Prayudh Payutto]], [[Neville Karunatilake]] and Padmasiri de Silva. 

Modern scholarship by Western Buddhist monks such as [[Nyanaponika Thera]] was also a new development in the modern era.

==Practice (''paṭipatti'')==
[[File:Dharmachakra, withprint (en).svg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Dharmachakra|Dharma wheel]] with eight spokes usually symbolizes the [[Noble Eightfold Path|eightfold path]].]]

===Textual basis===
In the [[Pāli Canon|Pali Canon]], the path (''magga'') or way (''patipada'') of Buddhist practice is [[Buddhist paths to liberation|described in various ways]], one of the most widely used frameworks in Theravāda is the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]:

{{quote|The Blessed One said, "Now what, monks, is the Noble Eightfold Path? Right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration."&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.008.than.html|title=Magga-vibhanga Sutta: An Analysis of the Path|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Noble Eightfold Path can also be summarized as the Three Noble Disciplines of [[śīla|sīla]] (moral conduct or discipline), [[Samadhi|samādhi]] (meditation or concentration) and [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|paññā]] (understanding or wisdom).&lt;ref group="web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.4.pali.103879|title=The Pali Text Society's Pali-English dictionary|date=|publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708195133/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.4.pali.103879|archive-date=2012-07-08|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:989.pali|title=The Pali Text Society's Pali-English dictionary|date=|publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708071648/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:989.pali|archive-date=2012-07-08|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3397.pali|title=The Pali Text Society's Pali-English dictionary|date=|publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709035335/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3397.pali|archive-date=2012-07-09|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theravāda orthodoxy takes the [[Visuddhimagga#Seven Stages of Purification|seven stages of purification]] as outlined in the [[Visuddhimagga|''Visuddhimagga'']] as the basic outline of the path to be followed. The ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', a Sinhalese Theravāda doctrinal [[Summa|''summa'']] written in the fifth century by [[Buddhaghosa]], became the orthodox account of the Theravāda path to liberation in [[Sri Lanka]] after the 12th century and this influence spread to other Theravāda nations.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; It gives the sequence of seven purifications, in three sections:

* The first section (part 1) explains the rules of discipline, and the method for finding a correct temple to practice, or how to meet a [[Kalyāṇa-mittatā|good teacher]].
* The second section (part 2) describes [[samatha]] (calming) practice, object by object (see [[kammaṭṭhāna]] for the list of the forty traditional objects). It mentions different stages of [[Samadhi|samādhi]].
* The third section (parts 3–7) is a description of the five [[Skandha|khandhas]], [[ayatana]]s, the [[Four Noble Truths]], [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]], and the practise of [[vipassanā]] (insight) through the development of wisdom. It emphasizes [[Vipassanā-ñāṇa|different forms of knowledge]] emerging because of the practice. This part shows a great analytical effort specific to [[Buddhist philosophy]].

This basic outline is based on the threefold discipline. The emphasis is on understanding the [[three marks of existence]], which removes [[avijja|ignorance]]. Understanding destroys the ten [[Fetter (Buddhism)|fetters]] and leads to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nibbana]].

Theravadins believe that every individual is personally responsible for their own self-awakening and liberation, as they are the ones that were responsible for their own [[karma in Buddhism|kamma]] (actions and consequences). Great emphasis is placed upon applying the knowledge through direct experience and personal realization, than believing about the known information about the nature of reality as said by the Buddha.

===Moral conduct===
[[File:Monks in Thailand.JPG|thumb|right|225px| Giving (Dana) is an important Buddhist virtue. The community of monastics is seen as the most meritorious field of karmic fruitfulness.]]

[[Buddhist ethics|Sīla]], moral conduct, mainly defined as [[right speech]], [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right action|right action]], and [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right livelihood|right livelihood]] is primarily understood through the doctrine of [[Karma in Buddhism|kamma]]. In Theravāda, one's present experience is strongly influenced by one's previous intentional actions and whatever actions one intends and then does will have consequences in the future, whether in this life or the next.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Intention is central to the idea of kamma, actions which are done with good intentions, even if they have bad results, will not result in negative kammic consequences. 

To guide right action, there are several sets of precepts or moral trainings (''sikkhāpada''). Traditionally, Theravāda laypersons take the [[five precepts]] (whether for life or for a limited time) in front of a monastic after taking [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] in the three jewels.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Laypeople also sometimes take an extended set of eight precepts which includes chastity during special occasions such as religious holidays.

Another important feature of Theravāda ethics is the doing of good deeds, performing these deeds are said to make "merit" ([[Merit (Buddhism)|puñña]]), which will allow one a better rebirth. A common list of good deeds is the "ten wholesome actions": &lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Generosity (dana); This is widely done by giving “the four requisites” to monks; food, clothing, shelter, and medicine. However giving to the needy is also a part of this. 
# Moral conduct (sila); Keeping the five precepts, generally non-harming. 
# Meditation (bhavana). 
# Transferring merit; doing good deeds in the name of someone who has died or in the name of all beings. 
# Rejoicing in merit of good deeds done by others, this is common in communal activities. 
# Rendering service to others; looking after others. 
# Honoring others; showing appropriate deference, particularly to the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, and to seniors and parents. Usually done by pl;acing the hands together in [[Añjali Mudrā]], and sometimes bowing.
# Preaching [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dhamma]]; the gift of Dhamma is seen as the highest gift.
# Listening to Dhamma
# Having correct views; mainly the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the [[three marks of existence]].

===Meditation===
{{Main article|Buddhist meditation}}
[[File:Buddhist Man Meditating.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Theravādin monks meditating in [[Bodh Gaya]] ([[Bihar]], [[India]])]]

Meditation (Pali: ''Bhavana,'' literally "causing to become" or cultivation) means the positive cultivation of one's mind. 

====Re-invention====
While often presented as going back to the time of the Buddha, ''vipassana''-meditation as popularized by the [[vipassana movement]] dates back to the 19th and 20th century.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=890}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=189}}&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt; According to Buswell, by the 10th century ''vipassana'' was  no longer practiced in the Theravada tradition, due to the believe that Buddhism had degenerated, and that liberation was no longer attainable until the coming of ''Maitreya''.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=889}} It was re-introdcued in Myanmar (Burma) in the 18th century by [[Medawi]] (1728–1816). A revival of Theravāda meditation practice occurred primarily in [[Myanmar]] during the 19th and 20th centuries, re-inventing ''vipassana''-meditation and developing simplified meditation techniques, based on the ''[[Satipatthana sutta]]'', the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', and other texts, emphasizing ''[[satipatthana]]'' and bare insight.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=890}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=189}}&lt;ref name="Chapman"&gt;David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/07/07/theravada-reinvents-meditation/ ''Theravada reinvents meditation'' ]&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques were globally popularized by the [[Vipassana movement]] in the second half of the 20th century.

Though the ''Vipassana movement'' has popularised meditation both in traditional Theravada countries among the laity, and in western countries, "meditation plays a minor if not negligible role in the lives of the majority of Theravada monks."{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=242}}{{sfn|Crosby|2013|p=147}}&lt;ref group=web name="Braun2014"/&gt; Meditation is especially popular laypersons,{{sfn|Sharf|1995}} especially during special religious holidays or in their old age, when they have more free time to spend at the temple.{{sfn|Crosby|2013|p=147}} Buddhist modernists tend to present Buddhism as rational and scientific, and this has also affected how Vipassana meditation has been taught and presented. This has led in some quarters to a playing down of older non-empirical elements of Theravada, associated with '[[superstition]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Strains of older, traditional Theravāda meditation known as "borān kammaṭṭhāna" still exist, but this tradition has mostly been eclipsed by the [[Buddhist modernism|Buddhist modernist]] meditation movements.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Techniques - ''samatha'' and ''vipassana''====
Theravāda Buddhist meditation practice varies considerably in technique and objects.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, pp 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Theravāda Buddhist meditation practices or [[Bhavana|bhavanas]] (cultivations) are categorized into two broad categories: [[Samatha]] bhavana (calming), and [[Vipassanā]] bhavana (investigation, insight).&lt;ref group="web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3558.pali |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711062331/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3558.pali |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-11 |title=The Pali Text Society's Pali-English dictionary |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally these referred to effects or qualities of meditation, but after the time of [[Buddhaghosa]], it also referred to two distinct meditation types or paths (''yāna'').&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, 139-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vajiranāṇa-Mahathera"&gt;Vajiranāṇa Mahathera (author), Allan R. Bomhard (editor) (20100, ''Buddhist Meditation in Theory and Practice'', p.270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="web" name="supramundane"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/gunaratana/wheel351.html Henepola Gunaratana, ''The Jhanas in Theravāda Buddhist Meditation'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''Samatha'' ("calm") consists of meditation techniques in which the mind is focused on a single object, thought, or mantra, leading to ''[[samadhi]]'''. In traditional Theravada, it is onsidered to be the base for ''vipassanā'' ("insght"). In the Theravada-tradition, as early as the [[Nikāya|Pali Nikayas]], the four ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhānas]]'' are regarded as a ''samatha''-practice. The eight and final step of the Eightfold Path, Right Samadhi, is often defined as the four jhanas.&lt;ref&gt;Henepola Gunaratana, The Jhanas in Theravada Buddhist Meditation, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Nikāya|Pali Nikayas]], Jhānas are described as preceding the awakening insight of the Buddha, which turned him into an awakened being.&lt;ref group="web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/buddha.html|title=A Sketch of the Buddha's Life|publisher=Access to Insight|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the interpretation of ''jhana'' as single-pointed concentration and calm, may be a later re-interpretation, in which the original aim of ''jhana'' was lost.{{sfn|Polak|2011}}

''Vipassana''-meditation was invented in the 19th and 20th century, when monks in Thailand and Burma rejected the sole textual study of Buddhism, and tried to put the texts on meditation into practice.{{sfn|Polak|2011}}&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt; ''Vipassana'' applies  [[Anapanasati|mindfulness of breathing]] to calm the mind, focus it on the awareness of chnaging phenomena, and uses this to gain insight into ''[[dukkha]]'', ''[[anatta]]]'' and ''[[anicca]]''. ''Vipassana'' is also described as insight into [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]], the [[Skandha|five aggregates]], the [[Ayatana|sense spheres]] and the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;[[Nyanaponika Thera|Nyanaponika,]] The Heart of Buddhist meditation, Buddhist publication Society, 2005, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vajiranāṇa-Mahathera"/&gt; In western countries, it is complemented with the [[Brahmavihara|four divine abidings]], the development of loving-kindness and compassion.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998}}&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Vipassana''-practice begins with the preparatory stage, the practice of ''[[Śīla|sila]]'', morality, giving up worldly thoughts and desires.{{sfn|Wilson|2014|p=54-55}}&lt;ref&gt;Mahāsi Sayādaw, ''Manual of Insight, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; The practitioner then engages in ''[[anapanasati]]'', mindfulness of breathing, which is described in the [[Satipatthana Sutta]] as going into the forest and sitting beneath a tree and then to simply watch the breath. If the breath is long, to notice that the breath is long, if the breath is short, to notice that the breath is short.&lt;ref&gt;Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta No. 118, Section No. 2, translated from the Pali&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Satipatthana Sutta]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the "New Burmese Method," the practitioner [[Sati (Buddhism)|pays attention]] to any arising mental or physical phenomenon, engaging in [[vitaka]], noting or naming physical and mental phenomena ("breathing, breathing"), without engaging the phenomenon with further conceptual thinking.&lt;ref name="Practical"&gt;Mahasi Sayadaw, ''Practical Vipassana Instructions''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhante Bodhidhamma, [https://buddhismnow.com/2013/09/12/vipassana-as-taught-by-the-mahasi-sayadaw-of-burma/ ''Vipassana as taught by The Mahasi Sayadaw of Burma'']&lt;/ref&gt; By noticing the arising of physical and mental pohenomena, the meditator becomes aware how sense impressions arise from the contact between the senses and physical and mental phenomena,&lt;ref name="Practical"/&gt; as described in the five ''[[skandhas]]'' and ''[[paṭiccasamuppāda]]''. The practitioner also becomes aware of the perpetual changes involved in breathing, and the arising and passing away of mindfulness.&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt; This noticing is accompanied by reflections on [[paṭiccasamuppāda|causation]] and other Buddhist teachings, leading to insight into [[dukkha]], [[anatta]], and [[anicca]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahasi Sayadaw, ''Practical Vipassana Instructions'', p.22-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Art"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhamma.org/en/art.shtml |title=The Art of Living: Vipassana Meditation |publisher=Dhamma.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the three characteristics have been comprehended, reflection subdues, and the process of noticing accelerates, noting phenomena in general, without necessarily naming them.&lt;ref&gt;PVI, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nyanaponika|1998}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=133}}

According to Vajiranāṇa Mahathera, writing from a traditional and text-based point of view, in the Pali canon whether one begins the practice by way of samatha or by way of vipassanā is generally seen as depending on one's temperament. According to Vajiranāṇa Mahathera, it is generally held that there are two kinds of individuals. Those of a passionate disposition (or those who enter the path by faith), attain Arahatship through vipassanā preceded by samatha. Those of a skeptical disposition (or those who enter by way of wisdom or the intellect), achieve it through samatha preceded by vipassanā.&lt;ref name="Vajiranāṇa-Mahathera"/&gt;

====Aims of meditation====
[[File:Portrait of Ajahn Mun.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ajahn Mun, a key figure in the founding of the [[Thai Forest Tradition]], is widely considered to have been an Arahant in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin, Rupert, The Foundations of Buddhism, Oxford University Press, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Traditionally, the ultimate goal of the practice is to achieve mundane and supramundane wisdom. Mundane wisdom is the insight in the [[three marks of existence]].&lt;ref group=web name=supramundane /&gt; The development of this insight leads to four supramundane paths and fruits, these experiences consist a direct apprehension of Nibbana.&lt;ref name="supramundane2" group="web" /&gt; Supramundane (''lokuttara)'' wisdom refers to that which transcends the world of [[Saṃsāra|samsara]].&lt;ref group="web" name="supramundane2" /&gt;

Apart from [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nibbana]], there are various reasons why traditional Theravāda Buddhism advocates meditation, including a good [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], [[Ṛddhi|supranormal powers]], combating fear and preventing danger. Recent modernist Theravādins have tended to focus on the [[Research on meditation|psychological benefits]] and psychological [[Well-being|well being]],.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, 2013, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Four stages of enlightenment====
Accoding to Theravāda doctrine, liberation is attained in [[four stages of enlightenment]]:&lt;ref group="web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.12.0.than.html|title=Lohicca Sutta | accessdate=2009-03-27|publisher=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="supramundane" group="web" /&gt;

====Nirvana====
{{Main article|Nirvana}}

Nirvana ({{lang-sa|निर्वाण|}}, ''{{IAST|Nirvāṇa}}''; {{lang-pi|निब्बान}}, ''{{IAST|Nibbāna}}''; {{lang-th|นิพพาน|}}, ''{{IAST|Nípphaan}}'') is the ultimate goal of Theravadins. It is a state where the fire of the passions has been 'blown out', and the person is liberated from the [[Saṃsāra|repeated cycle of birth, illness, aging and death]]. In the ''Saṃyojanapuggala Sutta'' of the [[Anguttara Nikaya]], the Buddha describes four kinds of persons and tells us that the last person – the [[Arhat|Arahant]] – has attained Nibbana by removing all 10 [[fetters]] that bind beings to samsara:
{{quote|In the Arahant. In this person, monks, all of the fetters ['saṃyojanāni'] are gotten rid of that pertain to this world, give rise to rebirth, and give rise to becoming.&lt;ref name="PTS: A ii 133-134"&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=F.L.|title=The Book of Gradual Sayings (Aṇguttara Nikāya)|year=2008|publisher=Pali Text Society - Oxford|isbn= 978-0860130154|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the early scriptures, the Nirvana attained by ''[[Arahant]]s'' is identical to that attained by the Buddha himself, as there is only one type of Nirvana.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel409.html |title = A Treatise on the Paramis: From the Commentary to the Cariyapitaka |accessdate = 2007-07-31 |last = Bodhi }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theravadins believe the Buddha was superior to ''Arahants'' because the Buddha discovered the path all by himself and taught it to others (i.e., metaphorically turning the wheel of Dhamma). ''Arahants'', on the other hand, attained Nirvana partly because of the Buddha's teachings. Theravadins revere the Buddha as a supremely gifted person but also recognize the existence of other such Buddhas in the distant past and future. [[Maitreya]] (Pali: Metteyya), for example, is mentioned very briefly in the Pali Canon as a Buddha who will come in the distant future.

=== Other practices ===
[[File:Walk_with_lighted_candles_in_hand_around_a_temple.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Circumambulation]] around a temple or a stupa is also a common devotional practice.]]
Laypersons and monks also perform various types of religious practices daily or during [[Buddhist holidays]]. One of these is keeping a [[Shrine#Buddhism|Buddhist shrine]] with a picture or statue of the Buddha for devotional practice in one's home, mirroring the larger shrines at temples.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;[https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/khantipalo/wheel206.html Bhikkhu Khantipalo, Lay Buddhist Practice The Shrine Room, Uposatha Day, Rains Residence]

&lt;/ref&gt; It is common to offer candles, incense, flowers and other objects to these shrine.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Gestures of respect are also done in front of Buddha images and shrines, mainly the respectful salutation with the hands (''añjalikamma''), and the five-limb [[Prostration (Buddhism)|prostration]] (''pañc'anga-vandana'').&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

[[Buddhist chant|Buddhist forms of chanting]] is also widely practiced by both monks and laypersons, who may recite famous phrases such as the taking of [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]], the [[Metta Sutta|metta sutta]] and the [[Mangala Sutta|mangala sutta]] in front of their shrine. Chanting may also be part of the practice of recollection ([[anussati]]), which refers to contemplating various topics such as the sublime qualities of [[the Buddha]], Dhamma and Sangha or the [[Upajjhatthana Sutta|five subjects for daily recollection]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This may be done as part of a daily [[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]] ritual.

Another important religious practice for the devout is the keeping of special religious holidays known as [[Uposatha]] which are based on a lunar calendar. Laypersons commonly take the eight precepts while visiting a temple or monastery and commit to focusing on Buddhist practice for the day.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

Study (''ganthadhura'') of the Buddhist texts and listening to [[Dharma talk|Dhamma talks]] by monks or teachers are also important practices.

Traditionally, Theravāda Buddhism has observed a distinction between the practices suitable for a [[Householder (Buddhism)|lay person]] and the practices undertaken by ordained [[Bhikkhu|monks]] (in ancient times, there was a separate body of practices for nuns). While the possibility of significant attainment by laymen is not entirely disregarded by the Theravāda, it generally occupies a position of less prominence than in the [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] traditions, with monastic life being hailed as a superior method of achieving [[Nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiasocietymuseum.org/buddhist_trade/glossary.html#Theravāda|title=Glossary of Buddhism|work=Buddhist Art and the Trade Routes|publisher=[[Asia Society]]|year=2003|accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view that Theravāda, unlike other Buddhist schools, is primarily a monastic tradition has, however, been disputed.
{{quote|Some Western scholars have erroneously tried to claim that Mahāyāna is primarily a religion for laymen and Theravāda is a primarily monastic religion. Both Mahāyāna and Theravāda have as their foundation strong monastic communities, which are almost identical in their regulations. Schools of Mahāyāna Buddhism without monastic communities of fully ordained monks and nuns are relatively recent and atypical developments, usually based on cultural and historical considerations rather than differences in fundamental doctrine. Both Mahāyāna and Theravāda also provided a clear and important place for lay followers.|Ron Epstein, "Clearing Up Some Misconceptions about Buddhism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein |first1=Ron |year=1999 |title=Clearing Up Some Misconceptions about Buddhism |journal= Vajra Bodhi Sea: A Monthly Journal of Orthodox Buddhism |pages=41–43 |url=http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/Misconceptions%20about%20Buddhism.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This distinction between ordained monks and laypeople&amp;nbsp;– as well as the distinction between those practices advocated by the Pali Canon, and the folk religious elements embraced by many monks&amp;nbsp;– have motivated some scholars to consider Theravāda Buddhism to be composed of multiple separate traditions, overlapping though still distinct.  Most prominently, the anthropologist [[Melford Spiro]] in his work ''Buddhism and Society'' separated Burmese Theravāda into three groups: Apotropaic Buddhism (concerned with providing protection from evil spirits), Kammatic Buddhism (concerned with making [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] for a future birth), and Nibbanic Buddhism (concerned with attaining the liberation of [[Nirvana]], as described in the Tipitaka). He stresses that all three are firmly rooted in the Pali Canon. These categories are not accepted by all scholars, and are usually considered non-exclusive by those who employ them.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The role of lay people has traditionally been primarily occupied with activities that are commonly termed ''[[Merit (Buddhism)|merit-making]]'' (falling under Spiro's category of kammatic Buddhism). Merit-making activities include offering food and other basic necessities to monks, making donations to temples and monasteries, burning incense or lighting candles before images of the Buddha, and chanting protective or merit-making verses from the Pali Canon. Some lay practitioners have always chosen to take a more active role in religious affairs, while still maintaining their lay status. Dedicated lay men and women sometimes act as trustees or custodians for their temples, taking part in the financial planning and management of the temple. Others may volunteer significant time in tending to the mundane needs of local monks (by cooking, cleaning, maintaining temple facilities, etc.). Lay activities have traditionally not extended to study of the Pali scriptures, nor the practice of [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], though in the 20th century these areas have become more accessible to the lay community, especially in Thailand.

A number of senior monastics in the Thai Forest Tradition, including [[Buddhadasa]], [[Ajahn Maha Bua]], Ajahn Plien Panyapatipo,  [[Ajahn Pasanno]], and [[Ajahn Jayasaro]], have begun teaching meditation retreats outside of the monastery for lay disciples. [[Ajahn Sumedho]], a disciple of [[Ajahn Chah]], founded the [[Amaravati Buddhist Monastery]] in Hertfordshire, which has a retreat center specifically for lay retreats. Sumedho extended this to Harnham in Northumberland as [[Aruna Ratanagiri]] under the present guidance of [[Ajahn Munindo]], another disciple of Ajahn Chah.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Lay devotee===
[[File:Vesak_in_Uttaradit_(Thailand)_1.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vesak_in_Uttaradit_(Thailand)_1.jpg|left|thumb|The ceremony walks with lighted candles in hand around a temple on [[Vesak|Vesakha Puja]] in [[Uttaradit]], Thailand.]]
In Pali the word for a male lay devotee is [[Upasaka]] and a female devotee is Upasika. One of the duties of the lay followers, as taught by the Buddha, is to look after the needs of the monk/nuns. They are to see that the monk/nuns do not suffer from lack of the four requisites: food, clothing, shelter and medicine. As neither monks nor nuns are allowed to have an occupation, they depend entirely on the laity for their sustenance. In return for this charity, they are expected to lead exemplary lives.

In Myanmar and Thailand, the monastery was and is still regarded as a seat of learning. In fact today about half of the primary schools in Thailand are located in monasteries. Religious rituals and ceremonies held in a monastery are always accompanied by social activities. In times of crisis, it is to the monks that people bring their problems for counsel. Traditionally, a ranking monk will deliver a sermon four times a month: when the moon waxes and wanes and the day before the new and full moons. The laity also have a chance to learn meditation from the monks during these times.

It is also possible for a lay disciple to become enlightened.  As [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] notes, "The Suttas and commentaries do record a few cases of lay disciples attaining the final goal of Nirvana. However, such disciples either attain Arahantship on the brink of death or enter the monastic order soon after their attainment. They do not continue to dwell at home as Arahant householders, for dwelling at home is incompatible with the state of one who has severed all craving."&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''In the Buddha's Words'', Wisdom Publications 2005; page 376&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, it is now common for lay disciples to practice meditation, attend lay meditation centers and even aim for awakening. The impetus for this trend began in Myanmar and was supported by prime minister [[U Nu]] who himself established the International Meditation Center (IMC) in [[Yangon]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Swearer, Donald K. The Buddhist World of Southeast Asia: Second Edition, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern lay teachers such as [[Ba Khin|U Ba Khin]] (who was also the Accountant General of the [[Post-independence Burma, 1948–62|Union of Burma]]) promoted meditation as part of a laypersons daily routine.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  According to Donald K Swearer, another development in modern Theravada is "the formation of lay Buddhist associations that have partially assumed the social service responsibilities formerly associated with the monastery".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These include social service and activist organizations such as the Young Men’s Buddhist Association of Colombo, the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress, the [[Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement|Sarvodaya Shramadana]] of [[A. T. Ariyaratne]], the NGO's founded by [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] such as Santi Pracha.&lt;ref&gt;Swearer, Donald K. The Buddhist World of Southeast Asia: Second Edition, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monastic vocation===
[[Image:Na_uyana_aranya_cave_kuti.jpg|thumb|A cave ''kuti'' (hut) in the Sri Lankan forest monastery [[Na Uyana Aranya]].]]
Theravada sources dating back to medieval [[Sri Lanka]] (2nd century BCE to 10th century CE) such as the [[Mahavamsa]] show that monastic roles in the tradition were often seen as being in a polarity between urban monks (Sinhala: ''khaamawaasii,'' Pali: ''gamavasi'') on one end and rural forest monks (Sinhala: ''aranyawaasii,'' Pali: ''araññavasi, nagaravasi'', also known as ''Tapassin'') on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, J.L. Forest Monks and the Nation-state: An Anthropological and Historical Study, pp. 12, 15&lt;/ref&gt; The ascetic focused monks were known by the names ''Pamsukulikas'' (rag robe wearers) and ''Araññikas'' (forest dwellers).&lt;ref&gt;Tambiah, Stanley Jeyaraja, The Buddhist Saints of the Forest and the Cult of Amulets (Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology), 1984, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Mahavamsa mentions forest monks associated with the [[Mahavihara]]. The Pali [[Dhammapada]] Commentary mentions another split based on the "duty of study" and the "duty of contemplation".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, J.L. Forest Monks and the Nation-state: An Anthropological and Historical Study, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; This second division has traditionally been seen as corresponding with the city - forest split, with the city monks focusing on the vocation of books (''ganthadhura'') or learning (''pariyatti'') while the forest monks leaning more towards meditation (''vipassanadhura'') and practice (''patipatti'').&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tambiah, Stanley Jeyaraja, The Buddhist Saints of the Forest and the Cult of Amulets (Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology), 1984, p. 53, 58
&lt;/ref&gt; However this opposition is not consistent, and urban monasteries have often promoted meditation while forest communities have also produced excellent scholars, such as the [[Island Hermitage]] of [[Nyanatiloka]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Scholar monks generally undertake the path of studying and preserving the [[Pali literature]] of the Theravāda.&lt;ref&gt;Prapod Assavavirulhakarn, The Ascendency of Theravada Buddhism in Southeast Asia 1990, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Forest monks tend to be the minority among Theravada sanghas and also tend to focus on [[asceticism]] (''[[dhutanga]]'') and meditative praxis.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, J.L. Forest Monks and the Nation-state: An Anthropological and Historical Study, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; They view themselves as living closer to the ideal set forth by the Buddha, and are often perceived as such by lay folk, while at the same time often being on the margins of the Buddhist establishment and on the periphery of the social order.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, J.L. Forest Monks and the Nation-state: An Anthropological and Historical Study, p. 9-13&lt;/ref&gt;

While this divide seems to have been in existence for some time in the Theravada school, only in the 10th century is a specifically forest monk monastery, mentioned as existing near [[Anuradhapura]], called "Tapavana".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, J.L. Forest Monks and the Nation-state: An Anthropological and Historical Study, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; This division was then carried over into the rest of Southeast Asia as Theravada spread.

Today there are forest based traditions in most Theravada countries, including the [[Sri Lankan Forest Tradition]], the [[Thai Forest Tradition]] as well as lesser known forest based traditions in Burma and Laos, such as the Burmese forest based monasteries (''taw"yar'') of Pa Auk Sayadaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.paaukforestmonastery.org/about-us | title=Pa-Auk Tawya}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Thailand, forest monks are known as ''phra thudong'' (ascetic wandering monks) or ''phra thudong kammathan'' (wandering ascetic meditator).&lt;ref&gt;Tiyavanich, Kamala, nForest Recollections: Wandering Monks in Twentieth-Century Thailand p1 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordination===
[[File:Candidate for the Buddhist priesthood is ordaining to is a monk in a church.jpg|thumb|upright|Candidates for the Buddhist monkhood being ordained as monks in Thailand]]

The minimum age for ordaining as a Buddhist monk is 20 years, reckoned from conception. However, boys under that age are allowed to ordain as novices ([[śrāmaṇera|sāmaṇera]]), performing a ceremony such as ''[[shinbyu]]'' in Myanmar. Novices shave their heads, wear the yellow robes, and observe the Ten Precepts. Although no specific minimum age for novices is mentioned in the scriptures, traditionally boys as young as seven are accepted. This tradition follows the story of the Buddha's son, Rahula, who was allowed to become a novice at the age of seven. Monks follow 227 rules of discipline, while nuns follow 311 rules.

In most Theravāda countries, it is a common practice for young men to ordain as monks for a fixed period of time. In Thailand and Myanmar, young men typically ordain for the retreat during [[Vassa]], the three-month monsoon season, though shorter or longer periods of ordination are not rare. Traditionally, temporary ordination was even more flexible among Laotians. Once they had undergone their initial ordination as young men, Laotian men were permitted to temporarily ordain again at any time, though married men were expected to seek their wife's permission. Throughout Southeast Asia, there is little stigma attached to leaving the monastic life. Monks regularly leave the robes after acquiring an education, or when compelled by family obligations or ill health.

Ordaining as a monk, even for a short period, is seen as having many virtues. In many Southeast Asian cultures, it is seen as a means for a young man to "repay" his parents for their work and effort in raising him, because the merit from his ordination accrues to them as well. Thai men who have ordained as a monk may be seen as more fit husbands by Thai women, who refer to men who have served as monks with a colloquial term meaning "ripe" to indicate that they are more mature and ready for marriage. Particularly in rural areas, temporary ordination of boys and young men traditionally gave peasant boys an opportunity to gain an education in temple schools without committing to a permanent monastic life.

In Sri Lanka, temporary ordination is not practised, and a monk leaving the order is frowned upon. The continuing influence of the [[caste system in Sri Lanka]] plays a role in the taboo against temporary or permanent ordination as a bhikkhu in some orders. Though Sri Lankan orders are often organized along caste lines, men who ordain as monks temporarily pass outside of the conventional caste system, and as such during their time as monks may act (or be treated) in a way that would not be in line with the expected duties and privileges of their caste.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Men and women born in Western countries, who become Buddhists as adults, wish to become monks or nuns. It is possible, and one can live as a monk or nun in the country they were born in, seek monks or nuns which has gathered in a different Western country or move to a monastery in countries like Sri Lanka or Thailand. It is seen as being easier to live a life as a monk or nun in countries where people generally live by the culture of Buddhism, since it is difficult to live by the rules of a monk or a nun in a Western country. For instance, a Theravāda monk or nun is not allowed to work, handle money, listen to music, cook and so on, which are extremely difficult rules to live by in cultures which do not embrace Buddhism.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Some of the more well-known Theravādan monks are [[Mun Bhuridatta]], [[Ajahn Chah]], [[Ledi Sayadaw]], [[Webu Sayadaw]], Ajahn Plien Panyapatipo, [[Ajahn Sumedho]], [[Ajahn Khemadhammo]], [[Ajahn Brahm]], [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], [[Buddhadasa]], [[Mahasi Sayadaw]], [[Nyanaponika Thera]], [[Preah Maha Ghosananda]], [[U Pandita]], [[Ajahn Amaro]], [[Ajahn Sucitto]], [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], [[Walpola Rahula]], [[Henepola Gunaratana]], Bhante Yogavacara Rahula and [[Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro]].

===Monastic practices===
[[File:EveningPrayers01a.jpg|thumb|upright|A Buddhist Monk chants evening prayers inside a monastery located near the town of [[Kantharalak]], [[Thailand]].]]

The practices usually vary in different sub-schools and monasteries within Theravāda. But in the most orthodox forest monastery, the monk usually models his practice and lifestyle on that of the Buddha and his first generation of disciples by living close to nature in forest, mountains and caves. Forest monasteries still keep alive the ancient traditions through following the Buddhist monastic code of discipline in all its detail and developing meditation in secluded forests.

In a typical daily routine at the monastery during the 3 month vassa period, the monk will wake up before dawn and will begin the day with group chanting and meditation. At dawn the monks will go out to surrounding villages bare-footed on alms-round and will have the only meal of the day before noon by eating from the bowl by hand. Most of the time is spent on Dhamma study and meditation. Sometimes the abbot or a senior monk will give a Dhamma talk to the visitors. Laity who stay at the monastery will have to abide by the traditional [[Eight precepts|eight Buddhist precepts]].

The life of the monk or nun in a community is much more complex than the life of the forest monk. In the Buddhist society of Sri Lanka, most monks spend hours every day in taking care of the needs of lay people such as preaching ''bana,''&lt;ref&gt;Mahinda Deegalle, ''Popularizing Buddhism: Preaching as Performance in Sri Lanka'', State University of New York Press, Albany, New York,  2006.&lt;/ref&gt; accepting alms, officiating funerals, teaching ''dhamma'' to adults and children in addition to providing social services to the community.

After the end of the Vassa period, many of the monks will go out far away from the monastery to find a remote place (usually in the forest) where they can hang their umbrella tents and where it is suitable for the work of self-development. When they go wandering, they walk barefoot, and go wherever they feel inclined. Only those requisites which are necessary will be carried along.  These generally consist of the bowl, the three robes, a bathing cloth, an umbrella tent, a mosquito net, a kettle of water, a water filter, razor, sandals, some small candles, and a candle lantern.

The monks do not fix their times for walking and sitting meditation, for as soon as they are free they just start doing it; nor do they determine for how long they will go on to meditate. Some of them sometimes walk from dusk to dawn whereas at other times they may walk from between two and seven hours. Some may decide to fast for days or stay at dangerous places where ferocious animals live in order to aid their meditation.

Those monks who have been able to achieve a high level of attainment will be able to guide the junior monks and lay Buddhists toward the four degrees of spiritual attainment.

===Bhikkunis===

[[File:Dhammananda09.jpg|thumb|[[Dhammananda Bhikkhuni]].]]
A few years after the arrival of [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], the bhikkhu [[Sanghamitta|Saṅghamittā]], who is also believed to have been the daughter of Ashoka, came to Sri Lanka. She ordained the first nuns in Sri Lanka. In 429, by request of China's emperor, nuns from [[Anuradhapura]] were sent to China to establish the order there, which subsequently spread across East Asia. The [[prātimokṣa]] of the nun's order in [[East Asian Buddhism]] is the [[Dharmaguptaka]], which is different than the prātimokṣa of the current Theravada school; the specific ordination of the early Sangha in Sri Lanka not known, although the Dharmaguptaka sect originated with the Sthāvirīya as well.

The nun's order subsequently died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century and in Burma in the 13th century. It had already died out around the 10th century in other Theravadin areas. Novice ordination has also disappeared in those countries. Therefore, women who wish to live as renunciates in those countries must do so by taking eight or ten precepts. Neither laywomen nor formally ordained, these women do not receive the recognition, education, financial support or status enjoyed by Buddhist men in their countries.  These "precept-holders" live in Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal, and Thailand. In particular, the governing council of Burmese Buddhism has ruled that there can be no valid ordination of women in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree. Japan is a special case as, although it has neither the bhikkhuni nor novice ordinations, the precept-holding nuns who live there do enjoy a higher status and better education than their precept-holder sisters elsewhere, and can even become Zen priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lhamo.tripod.com/4ordin.htm|title=Resources on Women's Ordination|date=|publisher=Lhamo.tripod.com|accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tibet there is currently no bhikkhuni ordination, but the [[Dalai Lama]] has authorized followers of the Tibetan tradition to be ordained as nuns in traditions that have such ordination.

In 1996, 11 selected Sri Lankan women were ordained fully as Theravada bhikkhunis by a team of Theravāda monks in concert with a team of Korean nuns in India. There is disagreement among Theravāda [[vinaya]] authorities as to whether such ordinations are valid. The [[Dambulla]] chapter of the [[Siam Nikaya]] in Sri Lanka also carried out a nun's ordination at this time, specifically stating their ordination process was a valid Theravadin process where the other ordination session was not.{{sfn|Salgado|2013|pp=166-169}} This chapter has carried out ordination ceremonies for hundreds of nuns since then.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} This has been criticized by leading figures in the Siam Nikaya and [[Amarapura Nikaya]], and the governing council of [[Buddhism in Myanmar]] has declared that there can be no valid ordination of nuns in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree with this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kawanami|first1=Hiroko|date=2007|title=The bhikkhunī ordination debate: global aspirations, local concerns, with special emphasis on the views of the monastic community in Myanmar.

In 1997 [[Dhamma Cetiya Vihara]] in Boston was founded by Ven. Gotami of Thailand, then a 10 precept nun; when she received full ordination in 2000, her dwelling became America's first Theravada Buddhist bhikkhuni vihara.

A 55-year-old Thai Buddhist 8-precept white-robed maechee nun, Varanggana Vanavichayen, became the first woman to receive the going-forth ceremony of a Theravada novice (and the gold robe) in Thailand, in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~religion/thailand/ordination.shtml|title=Socially Engaged Buddhism in Thailand: Ordination of Thai Women Monks|last=Sommer, PhD|first=Jeanne Matthew|publisher=Warren Wilson College|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204105319/http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~religion/thailand/ordination.shtml|archivedate=4 December 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=6 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 28, 2003, [[Dhammananda Bhikkhuni]], formerly known as Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, became the first Thai woman to receive bhikkhuni ordination as a Theravada nun.&lt;ref name="thebuddhadharma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2003/summer/dhammananda.html|title=Ordained At Last|date=2003-02-28|publisher=Thebuddhadharma.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040206044757/http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2003/summer/dhammananda.html|archivedate=2004-02-06|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2010-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However Thailand's two main Theravada Buddhist orders, the Mahanikaya and Dhammayutika Nikaya, have yet to officially accept fully ordained women into their ranks.

In 2009 in Australia four women received bhikkhuni ordination as Theravada nuns, the first time such ordination had occurred in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wa.buddhistcouncil.org.au/home/therevadan-bhikkhunni-ordination-in-western-australia/|title=Thai monks oppose West Australian ordination of Buddhist nuns|date=|publisher=Wa.buddhistcouncil.org.au|accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed in Perth, Australia, on 22 October 2009 at Bodhinyana Monastery. Abbess Vayama together with Venerables Nirodha, Seri, and Hasapanna were ordained as Bhikkhunis by a dual Sangha act of Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis in full accordance with the Pali Vinaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhammasara.org.au/bhikkhuni-ordination.html|title=Bhikkhuni Ordination|date=2009-10-22|publisher=Dhammasara.org.au|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219112534/http://www.dhammasara.org.au/bhikkhuni-ordination.html|archive-date=2011-02-19|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2010-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, in the US, four novice nuns were given the full bhikkhuni ordination in the Thai Theravada tradition, which included the double ordination ceremony. [[Henepola Gunaratana]] and other monks and nuns were in attendance. It was the first such ordination ever in the Western hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Boorstein"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sylvia-boorstein/ordination-of-bhikkhunis-_b_702921.html#s133846|title=Ordination of Bhikkhunis in the Theravada Tradition|last=Boorstein|first=Sylvia|authorlink=Sylvia Boorstein|date=2011-05-25|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monastic orders within Theravāda===
[[File:Thai Buddhist monk blesses.jpg|thumb|Thai monks blessing the [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|King of Thailand]] in Wat Nong Wong, [[Sawankhalok District|Amphoe Sawankhalok]], [[Sukhothai Province|Sukhothai]], Thailand.]]

Theravāda monks typically belong to a particular ''[[nikaya]]'', variously referred to as monastic orders or fraternities. These different orders do not typically develop separate doctrines, but may differ in the manner in which they observe monastic rules. These monastic orders represent lineages of ordination, typically tracing their origin to a particular group of monks that established a new ordination tradition within a particular country or geographic area.

In Sri Lanka caste plays a major role in the division into nikayas. Some Theravāda Buddhist countries appoint or elect a [[sangharaja]], or Supreme Patriarch of the Sangha, as the highest ranking or seniormost monk in a particular area, or from a particular nikaya.  The demise of monarchies has resulted in the suspension of these posts in some countries, but patriarchs have continued to be appointed in Thailand.  Myanmar and Cambodia ended the practice of appointing a sangharaja for some time, but the position was later restored, though in Cambodia it lapsed again.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

'''St. Thomas of Villanova [[Order of Saint Augustine|O.S.A.]]''' (1488 – 8 September 1555) was a  [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[friar]] of the [[Order of Saint Augustine]] who was a noted preacher, [[asceticism|ascetic]] and religious writer of his day. He became an archbishop who was famous for the extent of his care for the poor of his see.

==Life==
He was born '''Tomás García y Martínez''' in [[Fuenllana]], Spain, in 1488.&lt;ref name=dohan&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14696a.htm Dohan, Edward. "St. Thomas of Villanova." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 20 Jan. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a miller,&lt;ref name=vu&gt;[http://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/mission/heritage/stthomas.html "St. Thomas of Villanova", Villanova University]&lt;/ref&gt; who  regularly distributed food and provisions to the poor, as did his mother.&lt;ref name=cna&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=710 "St. Thomas of Villanova", Catholic News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up and was educated in [[Villanueva de los Infantes, Ciudad Real|Villanueva de los Infantes]], in the [[Province of Ciudad Real]], Spain, therefore the name '''Thomas of Villanueva'''. Part of the original house still stands, with a coat of arms in the corner, beside a family chapel.  In spite of his family's wealth, as a young boy he often went about naked because he had given his clothing to the poor.

At the age of sixteen years, Thomas entered the [[University of Alcalá de Henares]] to study Arts and Theology. He became a professor there, teaching arts, logic, and philosophy, despite a continuing absentmindedness and poor memory.&lt;ref name=foley&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1134 Foley O.F.M., Leonard. ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast'', Franciscan Media]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1516, he decided to join the Augustinian friars in [[Salamanca]] and in 1518 was ordained a priest.

He became renowned for his eloquent and effective preaching in the churches of Salamanca.&lt;ref name=cna/&gt; Thomas composed beautiful sermons, among which stands out the ''Sermon on the Love of God,'' one of the great examples of sacred oratory of the 16th century. [[Charles V of Spain|Charles V]], upon hearing him preach, exclaimed, "This [[monsignor]] can move even the stones!".{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Charles named Thomas one of his councilors of state and court preacher in Valladolid, the residence of the Emperor when on his visits to the Low Countries.&lt;ref name=dohan/&gt;

His scathing attacks on his fellow bishops earned him the title of reformer.&lt;ref name=vu/&gt; Some of his sermons attacked the cruelty of bullfighting. He also had a great devotion to the [[Virgin Mary]], whose heart he compared to the burning bush of Moses that is never consumed.

Within the Order, he successively held the positions of [[prior]] of his local monastery, [[Apostolic visitor|Visitor]] General, and Prior [[provincial superior|Provincial]] for [[Andalusia]] and [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]. In 1533, Thomas sent out the first Augustinian friars to arrive in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=dohan/&gt; Charles V offered him the post of [[Archbishop]] of [[Granada]] but he would not accept it.

===Bishop===
[[File:Murillo Thomas of Vilanueva Heals The Sick.tiff|thumb|left|Thomas of Vilanueva Heals The Sick, Murillo]]
In 1544 he was nominated as Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Valencia in Spain|Valencia]] and he continued to refuse the position until ordered to accept by his superior. Given a donation to decorate his residence, he sent the money to a hospital in need of repair.&lt;ref name=cna/&gt; He began his episcopacy by visiting every parish in the Archdiocese to discover what the needs of the people were.&lt;ref name=midw&gt;[http://midwestaugustinians.org/st-thomas-of-villanova "St. Thomas of Villanova", Midwest Augustinians]&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by his assistant bishop, Juan Segriá, he put in order an archdiocese that for a century had not had direct pastoral government. He organized a special college for [[Moors|Moorish]] converts, and in particular an effective plan for social assistance, welfare, and charity.
In 1547 he ordained as a priest the future Saint [[Louis Bertrand (saint)|Luis Beltrán]], [[Dominican Order|O.P.]], a noted missionary in South America. Thomas started Presentation Seminary in 1550.&lt;ref name=midw/&gt;

He was well known for his great personal austerity  (he sold the straw mattress on which he slept in order to give money to the poor) and wore the same habit that he had received in the novitiate, mending it himself.&lt;ref name=foley/&gt; Thomas was known as “father of the poor.”&lt;ref name=vu/&gt; His continual charitable efforts were untiring, especially towards orphans, poor women without a dowry, and the sick. He possessed, however, an intelligent notion of charity, so that while he was very charitable, he sought to obtain definitive and structural solutions to the problem of poverty; for example, giving work to the poor, thereby making his charity bear fruit. "Charity is not just giving, rather removing the need of those who receive charity and liberating them from it when possible," he wrote. &lt;!-- «La limosna no sólo es dar, sino sacar de la necesidad al que la padece y librarla de ella cuando fuere posible.», escribió. --&gt;He established boarding schools and high schools.&lt;ref name=osa&gt;[http://osa-west.org/thomasofvillanova.html "Saint Thomas of Villanova, O.S.A.", Augustinians of the Western United States ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201175813/http://osa-west.org/thomasofvillanova.html |date=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas died in Valencia on September 8, 1555 of [[Angina pectoris|angina]] at the age of 67. His remains are preserved at the Cathedral there.&lt;ref name=midw/&gt;

==Veneration==
He was [[canonization|canonized]] by [[Pope Alexander VII]] on November 1, 1658.&lt;ref name=foley/&gt; His [[calendar of saints|feast day]] is celebrated on September 22.

==Legacy==
[[File:Lubaojf.JPG|thumb|264x264px|Barangay Santo Tomas Lubao, Pampanga (a Kapilya or Church) in Lubao Pampanga, Philippines, dedicated to Saint Thomas De Villanueva.]]
Thomas is the author of various ''Tracts,'' among which is included the ''Soliloquy between God and the soul,'' on the topic of communion. [[Francisco de Quevedo]] wrote his biography. His complete writings were published in six volumes as ''Opera omnia,'' in [[Manila]] in 1881.

Thomas is the [[namesake]] and [[patron saint]] of [[Villanova University]], near [[Philadelphia]] in the United States, which was founded and is administered by the friars of his Order; [[Universidad Católica de Santo Tomás de Villanueva]] in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]; [[St. Thomas University (Florida)|St. Thomas University]] in [[Miami Gardens]], [[Florida]], USA; and [[Villanova College (Australia)|Villanova College]], a Catholic school for boys located in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]. In the Philippines, some churches and towns are dedicated in honor of the saint with grand feast or fiesta celebrations with lots of food on the table for the guests and visitors. He is the patron saint of the towns of [[Alimodian]] and [[Miag-ao]], both in [[Iloilo]]. He is also the patron saint of Barangay Santolan in [[Pasig City]].

A congregation of sisters is also named after him.&lt;ref name=osa/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2314">'''Tradition history''' or '''criticism''' is a methodology of [[Biblical criticism]] that was developed by [[Hermann Gunkel]]. Tradition history seeks to analyze [[biblical literature]] in terms of the process by which biblical traditions passed from stage to stage into their final form, especially how they passed from [[oral tradition]] to [[written form]]. Tradition history/criticism is a sister discipline of [[form criticism]]—also associated with Gunkel, who used the results of [[Source criticism (biblical studies)|source]] and [[form criticism]] to develop the history of tradition interpretation.  Form criticism and tradition criticism thus overlap, though the former is more narrow in focus. Tradition history is connected with secular [[folklore]] studies, especially [[Axel Olrik]]'s analysis of [[Scandinavian folklore]] and the "laws" which he established concerning the nature of such folklore.  The stories in the [[Bible]] were then analyzed on the basis of these "laws".  

== Strengths and weaknesses ==
Tradition history forces interpreters to consider the possibility that some texts may have had an oral prehistory. It also notes that past traditions were retold and used for a present purpose; that it was made real, vital, or relevant for each successive [[generation]].

The method also has weaknesses. Tradition history creates highly speculative reconstructions, often built on the speculative deductions from source criticism. Moreover, tradition history may exaggerate the role of oral tradition. If texts were written soon after they were spoken so that there was not a long oral prehistory, then the assumptions of tradition history fall to the ground. The use of Olrik's laws is also dubious: It may be a false analogy to compare [[Icelandic folklore]] with [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew folklore]] since they are very different cultures. Some folklorists question whether Olrik's laws apply even to [[Scandinavian literature]] much less any other (Gunkel admitted they did not apply to all stories in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]).

In Islamic philosophy, '''Wahdat al-Mawjud''' is the opposite of [[Wahdat al-wujud]]. It is the concept that existence moves towards Spiritual oneness, but remains plural. Eventually human beings become ''İnsan-ı Kâmil and reach wisdom of god (Anal Haqq).''

A '''''zaouia''''' or '''''zawiya''''' ({{lang-ar|زاوية}} ''zāwiyah''; "assembly" "group" or "circle", also spelled ''zawiyah, zawiyya, zaouiya, zaouïa'' and ''zwaya'') is an [[Islam]]ic religious school or monastery. The term is [[Maghreb]]i and [[West African,]] roughly corresponding to the Eastern term ''[[madrasa]]''. A ''zawiya'' often contains a pool, and sometimes a fountain.&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Goulder, Stanley E. Porter, Paul M. Joyce, David E. Orton, ''Crossing the Boundaries: Essays in Biblical Interpretation'', 1994, BRILL publisher, 381 pages
{{ISBN|90-04-10131-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schools in the Maghreb ==
[[File:A zaouia next to the city wall of Kairouan in Tunisia.jpg|thumb|A zaouia next to the city wall of [[Kairouan]] in [[Tunisia]] in the early 20th century]]

In precolonial times, these were the primary sources for education in the area, and taught basic [[literacy]] to a large proportion of children even in quite remote mountainous areas - leading to the generally accepted speculation that literacy rates in [[Algeria]] at the time of the French conquest in 1830 were higher than those of European France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruedy|first=John|title=Modern Algeria : the origins and development of a nation|year=2005|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-21782-0|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their curriculum began with memorization of the [[Arabic alphabet]] and the later, shorter suras of the [[Qur'an]]; if a student was sufficiently interested or apt, it progressed to law ([[fiqh]]), theology, Arabic grammar (usually taught with [[al-Ajurrumi]]'s famous summary), mathematics (mainly as it pertained to the complex legal system of inheritance distribution), and sometimes astronomy.  These are still operational throughout the Maghreb, and continue to be a major educational resource in the [[Sahel]] of [[West Africa]], from [[Mauritania]] to [[Nigeria]].

== Sufi lodges ==
[[File:Marabutto-Taghirt.JPG|thumb|Zawiya at the entrance of [[Taghit]], [[Algeria]]]]

In the [[Arab world]], the term ''zawiya'' can also refer to a [[Sufi]] lodge, akin to the term Tekke/[[Tekyeh]] in Iran, Turkey and the former Ottoman areas, as well as [[khanqah]] or [[dargah]] used in various parts of Asia. An example is the [[Hilaliyya Zawiya]] in [[Syria]]. One of the best known living or contemporary ''zawiyas'' is the Zawiya of Sheikh Ahmed Tijani located in Fes, Morocco. There are several extensions or sub-zawiyas affiliated with this Zawiya located in various places around the world.

== Hassane tribal usage ==
{{main|Zawāyā}}
Among the [[Hassaniya]] [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking populations of [[Mauritania]], [[Western Sahara]], [[Morocco]], [[Mali]] and [[Algeria]] (often referred to as [[Moors]]/[[Maure]] and [[Sahrawis]]), the term is also used to signify a certain type of tribe. Sahrawi-Moorish society was traditionally (and still is, to some extent) stratified into several tribal [[caste]]s, with the [[Hassane]] warrior tribes ruling and extracting tribute—[[horma]]—from the subservient [[znaga]] tribes. A middle caste was formed by the [[Zawāyā]], or scholarly tribes, who provided [[religion|religious]] teaching and services. This did not necessarily mean that they maintained a monastery or school as described above, since all these tribes were more or less nomadic. However, important shaikhs and Sufis would sometimes create schools, or, after their deaths, their [[Grave (burial)|Shrine]] would turn into holy places of significance to the tribe its called Mazaar.

Often, the Zawāyā were descended from [[Sanhadja]] [[Berber people|Berber]]s, while the Hassane claimed lineage from the [[Beni Hassan]] [[Arab]]s. Even if intermarriage and tribal alliances made the distinction difficult to maintain from a scientific perspective, it was culturally important; however, from about the 19th century, most or all Sahrawi-Moorish tribes had adopted the Hassaniyya [[Arabic dialect]] and come to regard themselves as Arabs. Sometimes, the Zawāyā and Hassane roles changed with this: military and economic strength would often lead to a gradual redefinition of the tribe's role, and, simultaneously, to its self-perception of religious and ethnic background. Especially in the northern Hassane areas, i.e. today's Western Sahara, the Zawāyāa tribes were more or less synonymous with the Chorfa, tribes who claimed descent from the [[Prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. In the areas corresponding broadly to today's Mauritania, this was not necessarily so; there, the name "[[Marabout]]" is also used synonymously with "Zawāyā" in its tribal meaning.
