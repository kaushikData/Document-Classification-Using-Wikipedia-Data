'''971 Alsatia''', provisional designation ''{{mp|1921 LF}}'', is a carbonaceous background [[asteroid]] from the central region of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter. It was discovered on 23 November 1921, by French astronomer [[Alexandre Schaumasse]] at [[Nice Observatory]] in southeastern France.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; The asteroid was named after the French province [[Alsace]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

''Alsatia'' is a non-[[Asteroid family|family]] asteroid of the main belt's [[Background asteroid|background population]] when applying the [[Hierarchical Clustering Method (asteroids)|Hierarchical Clustering Method]] to its [[proper orbital elements]].&lt;ref name="Ferret" /&gt; It has also been dynamically classified as a member of the [[Eunomia family]] ({{small|[[FIN tbl#502|502]]}}), which has a different spectral type though. This suggests that ''Alsatia'' may be an [[Interloper (asteroid)|interloper]] to that family.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

It orbits the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|central]] main-belt at a distance of 2.2–3.1&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 4 years and 4 months (1,569 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.16 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 14[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

The body's [[observation arc]] begins with its first identification as ''{{mp|A908 UE}}'' at [[Heidelberg Observatory]] in October 1908, more than 13 years prior to its official discovery observation at Nice.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

In the [[SMASS classification]], ''Alsatia'' is a carbonaceous [[C-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

=== Rotation period ===

Several rotational [[lightcurve]]s of ''Alsatia'' have been obtained from photometric observations by [[Robert D. Stephens|Robert Stephens]] (2000),&lt;ref name="Stephens-2000a" /&gt; [[Laurent Bernasconi]] (2005),&lt;ref name="geneva-obs" /&gt; astronomer at the [[Oakley Southern Sky Observatory]] (2011),&lt;ref name="Melton-2012" /&gt; [[Brian D. Warner|Brian Warner]] (2011),&lt;ref name="Warner-2012c" /&gt; and Daniel Klinglesmith (2017).&lt;ref name="Klinglesmith-2017c" /&gt; Lightcurve analysis gave a consolidated [[rotation period]] of 9.614 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.17 to 0.29 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=2/2/2/3/3-]]}}).&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;{{efn|name=lightcurveplot-Warner}}

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite [[IRAS]], the Japanese [[Akari (satellite)|Akari satellite]] and the [[NEOWISE]] mission of NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]], ''Alsatia'' measures between 55.31 and 64.724 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] between 0.0403 and 0.05.&lt;ref name="Nugent-2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AKARI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masiero-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masiero-2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SIMPS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WISE" /&gt;

The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0415 and a diameter of 63.75 kilometers based on an [[absolute magnitude]] of 10.05.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SIMPS" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named after the French province [[Alsace]] (regained from Germany after the [[WWI]]) in northeast France between the Rhine river and the Vosges mountains. In 1922, the discoverer proposed the name Alsace. However, the [[Astronomical Calculation Institute (Heidelberg University)|Astronomical Calculation Institute]], then responsible for the naming of minor planets, changed the name in Alsatia.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The political status of Alsace has been heavily influenced by historical decisions, wars, and strategic politics.

The '''Bering Canyon''' is the longest of the [[Bering Sea]] [[submarine canyon]]s; it extends about 400&amp;nbsp;km across the Bering shelf and slope. It is confined at its eastern edge by the [[Aleutian Islands]]. The width of the canyon at the shelf break is about 65&amp;nbsp;km, only about two-thirds that of the [[Zhemchug Canyon]] and [[Navarin Canyon]]s, but because of its great length, the Bering Canyon has the largest area. At a depth of 3200 m, the Bering Canyon [[thalweg]] reaches the [[Aleutian Basin]], where a low-relief submarine channel-lobe system has developed.

This is a '''bibliography of literature dealing with the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]'''.

The Lewis and Clark Expedition or Corps of Discovery Expedition (1804–1806) was the first transcontinental expedition to the Pacific Coast by the [[United States]].  Commissioned by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] and led by two Virginia-born veterans of Indian wars in the Ohio Valley, [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]], the expedition had several goals. Their objects were both scientific and commercial – to study the area's plants, animal life, and geography, and to discover how the region could be exploited economically. According to Jefferson himself, one goal was to find a "direct &amp; practicable water communication across this continent, for the purposes of commerce with Asia" (the Northwest Passage).&lt;ref&gt;Elin Woodger, Brandon Toropov (2004). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8vYA0zDFy_IC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of the Lewis and Clark Expedition]''". Infobase Publishing. p.150. {{ISBN|0-8160-4781-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson also placed special importance on declaring U.S. sovereignty over the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s along the [[Missouri River]], and getting an accurate sense of the resources in the recently completed [[Louisiana Purchase]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1409488 ''Voyage of Domination, "Purchase" as Conquest, Sakakawea for Savagery: Distorted Icons from Misrepresentations of the Lewis and Clark Expedition''], James Fenelon, [[Mary Louise Defender Wilson|Mary Defender-Wilson]].

{{refimprove|date=April 2015}}

A '''bioregion''' is an [[ecology|ecologically]] and geographically defined area that is smaller than an [[ecozone]], but larger than an [[ecoregion]] or an [[ecosystem]], in the [[World Wildlife Fund]] classification scheme. There is also an attempt to use the term in a rank-less generalist sense, similar to the terms "biogeographic area" or "biogeographic unit".&lt;ref&gt;Vilhena, D., Antonelli, A. (2015). A network approach for identifying and delimiting biogeographical regions. ''Nature Communications'' 6, 6848, [http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7848].&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be conceptually similar to an [[ecoprovince]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecozones.ca/english/levels.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also differently used in the [[environmentalist]] context, being coined by Berg and Dasmann (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Berg, P. and Dasmann, R. (1977). Reinhabiting California. ''The Ecologist'' 7 (10): 399-401.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, K. 1999. What is bioregional planning?. In: R. Crofts, E. Maltby, R. Smith and L. Maclean (eds). ''Integrated Planning: International Perspectives''. Battleby, Scotland 7–9 April 1999: IUCN &amp; Scottish Natural Heritage.&lt;/ref&gt;

==WWF bioregions==
{{Main|Global 200}}
The WWF scheme further subdivides the ecozones into bioregions, defined as "geographic clusters of [[ecoregions]] that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family)." The WWF bioregions are as follows:{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

'''Classification of objects of the administrative-territorial system of Ukraine''' ('''KOATUU''') ({{lang-uk|Класифікатор об'єктів адміністративно-територіального устрою України}}, КОАТУУ), is a national standardization system established by the [[Derzhspozhivstandard|State Committee of Ukraine for the Technical Regulations and Consumer Policy]] on October 31, 1997, #659, and went into effect on January 1, 1998. 

KOATUU was directly inherited from and replaced the old Soviet system ''SOATO'' of the Soviet standard system [[GOST]], practically without major structural changes (some nomenclatural). KOATUU is numbered as DK 014-97 in the system of classification and coding of technical-economical and social information in Ukraine (abbreviated as DSK TESI). The classification is conducted by the Scientific-research Institute of Statistics of the [[State Statistics Committee of Ukraine]]. DK 014-97 (KOATUU) is planned to be integrated in the [[International Organization for Standardization]] and to follow the designated system for [[Ukraine]], [[ISO 3166-2:UA]].

{{Distinguish|common land}}

The '''commons''' is the cultural and [[natural]] resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable earth. These resources are held in common, not owned privately. Commons can also be understood as natural resources that groups of people (communities, user groups) manage for individual and collective benefit. Characteristically, this involves a variety of informal norms and values (social practice) employed for a governance mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Basu|first1=Soutrik|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|last3=Ruivenkamp|first3=Guido|title=Development of the drought tolerant variety Sahbhagi Dhan: exploring the concepts commons and community building|journal=International Journal of the Commons|date=17 March 2017|volume=11|issue=1|page=144||doi=10.18352/ijc.673|url=https://www.thecommonsjournal.org/articles/10.18352/ijc.673/|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Commons can be also defined as a social practice of governing a resource not by state or market but by a community of users that self-governs the resource through institutions that it creates .&lt;ref&gt; Classical theory based on Elinor Ostrom's book Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Definition and modern use==
The Digital Library of the Commons defines "commons" as "a general term for shared resources in which each stakeholder has an equal interest".&lt;ref&gt;Digital library of the commons – Indiana University, retrieved 02/01/16 [http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/contentguidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "commons" derives from the traditional English legal term for [[common land]], which are also known as "commons", and was popularised in the modern sense as a shared resource term by the ecologist [[Garrett Hardin]] in an influential 1968 article called [[The Tragedy of the Commons]]. As Frank van Laerhoven and Elinor Ostrom have stated; "Prior to the publication of Hardin's article on the tragedy of the commons (1968), titles containing the words 'the commons', '[[common pool resource]]s', or 'common property' were very rare in the academic literature."&lt;ref&gt;Frank van Laerhoven and Elinor Ostrom. "[https://www.thecommonsjournal.org/articles/abstract/10.18352/ijc.76/ Traditions and Trends in the Study of the Commons]". ''International Journal of the Commons'', Vol. 1, no. 1, October 2007, pp. 3–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Some texts make a distinction in [[usage]] between [[common ownership]] of the commons and [[collective ownership]] among a group of colleagues, such as in a producers' [[cooperative]]. The precision of this distinction is not always maintained.

The use of "commons" for natural resources has its roots in European intellectual history, where it referred to shared agricultural fields, grazing lands and forests that were, over a period of several hundred years, enclosed, claimed as private property for private use. In European political texts, the common wealth was the totality of the material riches of the world, such as the air, the water, the soil and the seed, all nature's bounty regarded as the inheritance of humanity as a whole, to be shared together. In this context, one may go back further, to the Roman legal category ''res communis'', applied to things common to all to be used and enjoyed by everyone, as opposed to ''res publica'', applied to public property managed by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Basu|first1=Soutrik|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|last3=Ruivenkamp|first3=Guido|title=Development of the drought tolerant variety Sahbhagi Dhan: exploring the concepts commons and community building|url=https://www.thecommonsjournal.org/articles/10.18352/ijc.673/|website=International Journal of the Commons|date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of commons==

=== Environmental resource ===

The examples below illustrate types of environmental commons.

==== European land use ====

{{main article|Common land}}

Originally in [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval England]] the common was an integral part of the [[manor]], and was thus legally part of the [[estate in land]] owned by the [[lord of the manor]], but over which certain classes of manorial tenants and others held certain rights. By extension, the term "commons" has come to be applied to other resources which a community has rights or access to. The older texts use the word "common" to denote any such right, but more modern usage is to refer to particular rights of common, and to reserve the name "common" for the land over which the rights are exercised. A person who has a right in, or over, common land jointly with another or others is called a ''commoner''.&lt;ref name="Anon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/commoner |title=Commoner |last=Anon |publisher=Farlex Inc |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In middle Europe, commons (relatively [[small-scale agriculture]] in, especially, southern Germany, Austria, and the alpine countries) were kept, in some parts, till the present.&lt;ref name="Rad" /&gt; Some studies have compared the German and English dealings with the commons between late medieval times and the agrarian reforms of the 18th and 19th centuries. The UK was quite radical in doing away with and enclosing former commons, while southwestern Germany (and the alpine countries as e.g. Switzerland) had the most advanced commons structures, and were more inclined to keep them. The [[Lower Rhine region]] took an intermediate position.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Zückert, "Allmende und Allmendaufhebung". ''Vergleichende Studien zum Spätmittelalter bis zu den Agrarreformen des 18./19. Jahrhunderts'' (= Quellen und Forschungen zur Agrargeschichte; Bd. 47), Stuttgart: Lucius &amp; Lucius 2003, IX + 462 S., 4 Farb-Abb., {{ISBN|978-3-8282-0226-9}} [http://www.sehepunkte.de/2004/10/5184.html review (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the UK and the former dominions have till today a large amount of [[Crown land]] which often is used for community or conservation purposes.

==== Mongolian grasslands ====

Based on a research project by the Environmental and Cultural Conservation in Inner Asia (ECCIA) from 1992 to 1995, satellite images were used to compare the amount of land degradation due to livestock grazing in the regions of Mongolia, Russia, and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sneath |first=David |title=State Policy and Pasture Degradation in Inner Asia |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/281/5380/1147.full?ijkey=2a465918ef9b55416bf136bee66c9175ccef1bdb&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha |work=Science Magazine |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mongolia, where shepherds were permitted to move collectively between seasonal grazing pastures, degradation remained relatively low at approximately 9%. Comparatively, Russia and China, which mandated state-owned pastures involving immobile settlements and in some cases privatization by household, had much higher degradation, at around 75% and 33% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ostrom |first=Elinor |title=Revisiting the Commons: Local Lessons, Global Challenges |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/284/5412/278.full |work=Science Magazine |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collaborative effort on the part of Mongolians proved much more efficient in preserving grazing land.

==== Lobster fishery of Maine ====

Widespread success of the Maine lobster industry is often attributed to the willingness of Maine's lobstermen to uphold and support lobster conservation rules. These rules include harbor territories not recognized by the state, informal trap limits, and laws imposed by the state of Maine (which are largely influenced by lobbying from lobster industry itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Acheson |first=James |title=Capturing the Commons: Devising Institutions to Manage the Maine Lobster |year=2004 |publisher=University Press of New England |url=https://books.google.com/?id=u23TkAVptOYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=james+acheson+lobster#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=9781584653936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the lobstermen collaborate without much government intervention to sustain their common-pool resource.

==== Community forests in Nepal ====

In the late 1980s, Nepal chose to decentralize government control over forests. Community forest programs work by giving local areas a financial stake in nearby woodlands, and thereby increasing the incentive to protect them from overuse. Local institutions regulate harvesting and selling of timber and land, and must use any profit towards community development and preservation of the forests. In twenty years, locals have noticed a visible increase in the number of trees. Community forestry may also contribute to community development in rural areas – for instance school construction, irrigation and drinking water channel construction, and road construction. Community forestry has proven conducive to democratic practices at grass roots level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mehta |first=Trupti Parekh |title=Community Forestry in India and Nepal |work=PERC Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Irrigation systems of New Mexico ====

{{Main article|Acequia}}

''Acequia'' is a method of collective responsibility and management for irrigation systems in desert areas. In New Mexico, a community-run organization known as Acequia Associations supervises water in terms of diversion, distribution, utilization, and recycling, in order to reinforce agricultural traditions and preserve water as a common resource for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Davidson-Harden |first=Adam |title=Local Control and Management of Our Water Commons: Stories of Rising to the Challenge |url=http://ourwatercommons.org/sites/default/files/local-control-management-water-commons.pdf |work=www.ourwatercommons.org |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural and intellectual commons===
Today, the commons are also understood within a [[cultural]] sphere. These commons include literature, music, arts, design, film, video, television, radio, information, software and sites of heritage. [[Wikipedia]] is an example of the production and maintenance of [[common good]]s by a contributor community in the form of encyclopedic knowledge that can be freely accessed by anyone without a central authority.&lt;ref&gt;Huberman, Bernardo A. and Romero, Daniel M. and Wu, Fang, Crowdsourcing, Attention and Productivity (September 12, 2008). {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.1266996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tragedy of the commons]] in the Wiki-Commons is avoided by community control by individual authors within the Wikipedia community.&lt;ref&gt;"Avoiding Tragedy in the Wiki-Commons", by Andrew George, 12 Va. J.L. &amp; Tech. 8 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The information commons may help protect users of commons. Companies that pollute the environment release information about what they are doing. The Corporate Toxics Information Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Corporate Toxics Information Project |url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/Corporate-Toxics.298.0.html |work=[[Political Economy Research Institute]] |publisher=PERI-Umass |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725114045/http://www.peri.umass.edu/Corporate-Toxics.298.0.html |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and information like the Toxic 100, a list of the top 100 polluters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ash |first=Michael |title=Justice in the Air |url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/dpe/ctip/justice_in_the_air.pdf |work=PERI |publisher=PERI- Umass}}&lt;/ref&gt; helps people know what these corporations are doing to the environment.

===Digital commons===
{{Main article|Digital commons (economics)}}

[[Mayo Fuster Morell]] proposed a definition of digital commons as "information and knowledge resources that are collectively created and owned or shared between or among a community and that tend to be non-exclusive, that is, be (generally freely) available to third parties. Thus, they are oriented to favor use and reuse, rather than to exchange as a commodity. Additionally, the community of people building them can intervene in the governing of their interaction processes and of their shared resources."&lt;ref&gt;Fuster Morell, M. (2010, p. 5). Dissertation: ''Governance of online creation communities: Provision of infrastructure for the building of digital commons''. http://www.onlinecreation.info/?page_id=338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=David |date=21 February 2005 |title=The commons |journal=[[Free Software Magazine]] |url=http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/commons_as_ideas |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of digital commons are [[Wikipedia]], [[free software]] and [[open-source hardware]] projects.

===Urban commons===
Urban commons present the opportunity for the citizens to gain power upon the management of the urban resources and reframe city-life costs based on their use value and maintenance costs, rather than the market-driven value.&lt;ref&gt;Dellenbaugh-Losse, M. (2017). "[https://urban-policy.com/2017/09/18/what-makes-urban-commons-different/ What makes urban commons different from other commons?]" ''Urban Policy''. Retrieved December 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:20110630 Indignados Syntagma general mass Athens Greece.jpg|thumb|Syntagma Square in Athens as urban commons]]
[[File:Tahrir Square - February 9, 2011.png|thumb|Tahrir Square in Cairo as urban commons]]
Urban commons situates citizens as key players rather than public authorities, private markets and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shareable.net/sites/default/files/Sharing%20Cities.pdf Sharing Cities: activating the Urban Commons]. (2017). Mountain View: Shareable. Retrieved December 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; David Harvey (2012) defines the distinction between public spaces and urban commons. Public spaces and goods in the city make a commons when part of the citizens take political action. Syntagma Square in Athens, Tahrir Square in Cairo, and the Plaza de Catalunya in Barcelona were public spaces that transformed to an urban commons as people protested there to support their political statements. Streets are public spaces that have often become an urban commons by social action and revolutionary protests.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, D. (2013). "[http://abahlali.org/files/Harvey_Rebel_cities.pdf Rebel cities: from the right to the city to the urban revolution]". London: Verso&lt;/ref&gt;. Urban commons are operating in the cities in a complementary way with the state and the market. Some examples are community gardening, urban farms on the rooftops and cultural spaces&lt;ref&gt;C. Iaione. "[https://www.greeneuropeanjournal.eu/the-city-as-a-commons/ The city as a commons]" (personal communication, November 9, 2016) [Blog post]&lt;/ref&gt;.

City vol. 6 (2) &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; See also [http://www.infra-demos.net infra-demos] &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Knowledge commons===
In 2007, Elinor Ostrom along with her colleague Charlotte Hess, did succeed in extending the commons debate to knowledge, approaching knowledge as a complex ecosystem that operates as a common – a shared resource that is subject to social dilemmas. The focus here was on the ready availability of digital forms of knowledge and associated possibilities to store, access and share it as a common. The connection between knowledge and commons may be made through identifying typical problems associated with natural resource commons, such as congestion, overharvesting, pollution and inequities, which also apply to knowledge. Then, effective alternatives (community-based, non-private, non-state), in line with those of natural commons (involving social rules, appropriate property rights and management structures), solutions are proposed. Thus, the commons metaphor is applied to social practice around knowledge. It is in this context that the present work proceeds, discussing the creation of depositories of knowledge through the organised, voluntary contributions of scholars (the research community, itself a social common), the problems that such knowledge commons might face (such as free-riding or disappearing assets), and the protection of knowledge commons from enclosure and commodification (in the form of intellectual property legislation, patenting, licensing and overpricing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Basu|first1=Soutrik|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|last3=Ruivenkamp|first3=Guido|title=Development of the drought tolerant variety Sahbhagi Dhan: exploring the concepts commons and community building|journal=International Journal of the Commons|date=17 March 2017|volume=11|issue=1|page=144|doi=10.18352/ijc.673|url=https://www.thecommonsjournal.org/articles/10.18352/ijc.673/|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, it is important to note the nature of knowledge and its complex and multi-layered qualities of non-rivalry and non-excludability. Unlike natural commons – which are both rival and excludable (only one person can use any one item or portion at a time and in so doing they use it up, it is consumed) and characterised by scarcity (they can be replenished but there are limits to this, such that consumption/destruction may overtake production/creation) – knowledge commons are characterised by abundance (they are non-rival and non-excludable and thus, in principle, not scarce, so not impelling competition and compelling governance). This abundance of knowledge commons has been celebrated through alternative models of knowledge production, such as Commons Based Peer Production (CBPP), and embodied in the free software movement. The CBPP model showed the power of networked, open collaboration and non-material incentives to produce better quality products (mainly software).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Basu|first1=Soutrik|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|last3=Ruivenkamp|first3=Guido|title=The emergence of a hybrid mode of knowledge production in the Generation Challenge Programme Rice Research Network (GCP-RRN) in India: Exploring the concept of Commons-Based Peer Production (CBPP)|journal=Geoforum|volume=84|page=107|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2017.06.008|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718517301562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic theories==

===Tragedy of the commons===
{{Main article|Tragedy of the commons}}
A commons failure theory, now called [[tragedy of the commons]], originated in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Rad"&gt;{{harvnb|Radkau|2008|p=90, ff in the German text}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833 [[William Forster Lloyd]] introduced the concept by a hypothetical example of herders overusing a shared parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze, to the detriment of all users of the common land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lloyd |first=William Forster |title=Two Lectures on Population |year=1833 |jstor=1972412}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same concept has been called the "tragedy of the fishers", when over-fishing could cause stocks to plummet.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Bowles: Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution, [[Princeton University Press]], pp. 27–29 (2004) {{ISBN|0-691-09163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said the dissolution of the traditional land commons played a watershed role in landscape development and cooperative land use patterns and property rights.&lt;ref name=ws&gt;The end of the commons as a watershed' The Age of Ecology, Joachim Radkau, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 3 April 2014, p. 15 ff&lt;/ref&gt; However, as in the British Isles, such changes took place over several centuries as a result of land [[enclosure]].

Economist Peter Barnes has proposed a 'sky trust' to fix this tragedic problem in worldwide generic commons. He claims that the sky belongs to all the people, and companies do not have a right to over pollute. It is a type of cap and dividend program. Ultimately the goal would be to make polluting excessively more expensive than cleaning what is being put into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnes |first=Peter |title=Pie in the Sky |year=2000 |publisher=Corporation for Enterprise Development |location=Washington D.C |isbn=1-883187-32-X |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Successful commons===
While the original work on the tragedy of the commons concept suggested that all commons were doomed to failure, they remain important in the modern world. Work by later economists has found many examples of successful commons, and [[Elinor Ostrom]] won the [[Nobel prize]] for analysing situations where they operate successfully.&lt;ref name=rifkin /&gt;&lt;ref name=governing&gt;{{cite book|author=Elinor Ostrom |year=2015 |title=Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action |isbn=9781107569782}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Ostrom found that grazing commons in the [[Swiss Alps]] have been run successfully for many hundreds of years by the farmers there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/06/12/154872185/remembering-elinor-ostrom-nobel-laureate NPR: Remembering Elinor Ostrom, Nobel Laureate Updated June 13, 201211:08 AM ET Published June 12, 20125:37 PM ET]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allied to this is the "comedy of the commons" concept, where users of the commons are able to develop mechanisms to police their use to maintain, and possibly improve, the state of the commons.{{r|comedy}} This term was coined in an essay by legal scholar, Carol M. Rose, in 1986.{{r|comedy}}&lt;ref name=rifkin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Drama of the Commons
By Committee on the Human Dimensions of Global Change, National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Board on Environmental Change and Society&lt;/ref&gt;

Other related concepts are the ''inverse commons'', ''[[cornucopia]] of the commons''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bricklin.com/cornucopia.htm|title=The Cornucopia of the Commons: How to get volunteer labor|website=www.bricklin.com|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and ''triumph of the commons''.&lt;ref name=bollier&gt;Silent Theft: The Private Plunder of Our Common Wealth By David Bollier&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cox /&gt; It is argued that some types of commons, such as [[open-source software]], work better in the cornucopia of the commons; proponents say that, in those cases, "the grass grows taller when it is grazed on".&lt;ref&gt;The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an … By Eric Raymond&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Environmental law}}
{{Progressivism}}

'''Environmental justice''' emerged as a concept in the United States in the early 1980s. The term has two distinct uses with the more common usage describing a [[social movement]] that focuses on the fair distribution of environmental benefits and burdens.  The other use is an interdisciplinary body of social science literature that includes theories of the environment and justice, environmental laws and their implementations, environmental policy and planning and governance for development and sustainability, and political ecology.&lt;ref name="Schlosberg"&gt;Schlosberg, David. (2007) ''Defining Environmental Justice: Theories, Movements, and Nature''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller, Jr. |first=G. Tyler |title=Environmental Science: Working With the Earth |edition=9th |year=2003 |publisher=Brooks/Cole |location=Pacific Grove, California |isbn=0-534-42039-7 |page=G5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] defines environmental justice as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Environmental justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. EPA has this goal for all communities and persons across this Nation{{sic}}. It will be achieved when everyone enjoys the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards and equal access to the decision-making process to have a healthy environment in which to live, learn, and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Justice|publisher=U.S. EPA|url=http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/|accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other definitions include: equitable distribution of environmental risks and benefits; fair and meaningful participation in environmental decision-making; recognition of community ways of life, local knowledge, and cultural difference; and the capability of communities and individuals to function and flourish in society.&lt;ref name="Schlosberg"/&gt; An alternative meaning, used in social sciences, of the term "justice" is "the distribution of social goods".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moral and Political Reasoning in Environmental Practice|last=Schlosberg|first=David|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=0262621649|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental discrimination==

Environmental discrimination is one issue that environmental justice seeks to address. [[Racism]] and [[discrimination]] against minorities center on a socially-dominant group's belief in its superiority, often resulting in privilege for the dominant group and the mistreatment of non-dominant minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Racism|url=http://www.pollutionissues.com/Ec-Fi/Environmental-Racism.html|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined impact of these privileges and prejudices are just one of the potential reasons that waste management and high pollution sites tend to be located in minority-dominated areas. A disproportionate quantity of minority communities (for example in [[Warren County, North Carolina|Warren County]], [[North Carolina]]) play host to landfills, incinerators, and other potentially toxic facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skelton|first=Renee|title=The Environmental Justice Movement|url=http://www.nrdc.org/ej/history/hej.asp|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental discrimination can also be the placement of a harmful factory in a place of minority. This can be seen as environmental discrimination because it is placing a harmful entity in a place where the people often don't have the means to fight back against big corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diamond: A Struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor|last=Lerner|first=Steve|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental discrimination has historically been evident in the process of selecting and building environmentally hazardous sites, including [[waste disposal]], [[manufacturing]], and energy production facilities. The location of transportation infrastructures, including highways, ports, and airports, has also been viewed as a source of environmental injustice. Among the earliest documentation of environmental racism was a study of the distribution of toxic waste sites across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Chavis, Benjamin F., Goldman, Benjamin A. and Charles Lee.

Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is often used in lawsuits that claim environmental inequality. Section 601 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin by any government agency receiving federal assistance. To win an environmental justice case that claims an agency violated this statute, the plaintiff must prove the agency intended to discriminate. Section 602 requires agencies to create rules and regulations that uphold section 601. This section is useful because the plaintiff must only prove that the rule or regulation in question had a discriminatory impact. There is no need to prove discriminatory intent. ''Seif v. Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living'' set the precedent that citizens can sue under section 601. There has not yet been a case in which a citizen has sued under section 602, which calls into question whether this right of action exists.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Learning"/&gt;

The [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which was used many times to defend minority rights during the 1960s, has also been used in numerous environmental justice cases.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Learning"/&gt;

==Initial barriers to minority participation==

When [[environmentalism]] first became popular during the early 20th century, the focus was wilderness protection and wildlife preservation. These goals reflected the interests of the movement's initial supporters. The actions of many mainstream environmental organizations still reflect these early principles.&lt;ref name="Sandler, R. 2007 pp. 27-55"&gt;Sandler, R., &amp; Phaedra, P. (2007). Environmental justice and environmentalism. (pp. 27-55).&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous low-income minorities felt isolated or negatively impacted by the movement, exemplified by the Southwest Organizing Project's (SWOP) Letter to the Group of 10, a letter sent to major environmental organizations by several local environmental justice activists.&lt;ref&gt;"SWOP Letter to the Group of 10 ." Southwest Organizing Project. N.p.. Web. 7 May 2013. &lt;[http://www.swop.net/node/26]&gt;. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514131800/http://www.swop.net/node/26 |date=May 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter argued that the environmental movement was so concerned about cleaning up and preserving nature that it ignored the negative side-effects that doing so caused communities nearby, namely less job growth.&lt;ref name="Sandler, R. 2007 pp. 27-55"/&gt; In addition, the [[NIMBY]] movement has transferred [[locally unwanted land use]]s (LULUs) from middle-class neighborhoods to poor communities with large minority populations. Therefore, vulnerable communities with fewer political opportunities are more often exposed to hazardous waste and toxins.&lt;ref name="NIMBY Victims"&gt;{{Cite journal

{{anchor|Environmental elitism}}
As a result, some minorities have viewed the environmental movement as elitist. Environmental elitism manifested itself in three different forms:

# ''Compositional''&amp;nbsp;– Environmentalists are from the middle and upper class.
# ''Ideological''&amp;nbsp;– The reforms benefit the movement's supporters but impose costs on nonparticipants.
# ''Impact''&amp;nbsp;– The reforms have "regressive social impacts". They disproportionately benefit environmentalists and harm underrepresented populations.&lt;ref name="Environmental elitism"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of economic growth have taken advantage of environmentalists' neglect of minorities. They have convinced minority leaders looking to improve their communities that the economic benefits of industrial facility and the increase in the number of jobs are worth the health risks. In fact, both politicians and businesses have even threatened imminent job loss if communities do not accept hazardous industries and facilities. Although in many cases local residents do not actually receive these benefits, the argument is used to decrease resistance in the communities as well as avoid expenditures used to clean up pollutants and create safer workplace environments.&lt;ref name="Job Blackmail"&gt;{{Cite news

===Cost barriers===
{{Original research|section|date=January 2013}}
One of the prominent barriers to minority participation in environmental justice is the initial costs of trying to change the system and prevent companies from dumping their toxic waste and other pollutants in areas with high numbers of minorities living in them. There are massive legal fees involved in fighting for environmental justice and trying to shed environmental racism. For example, in the United Kingdom, there is a rule that the claimant may have to cover the fees of their opponents, which further exacerbates any cost issues, especially with lower income minority groups; also, the only way for environmental justice groups to hold companies accountable for their pollution and breaking any licensing issues over waste disposal would be to sue the government for not enforcing rules. This would lead to the forbidding legal fees that most could not afford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffries|first=Elisabeth|title=What price environmental justice?|url=http://www.environmentalistonline.com/article/2011-03-09/what-price-environmental-justice|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen by the fact that out of 210 judicial review cases between 2005 and 2009, 56% did not proceed due to costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost Barriers to Environmental Justice|url=http://us.practicallaw.com/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1247269202785&amp;ssbinary=true|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions of the Civil Rights Movement==

During the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s, activists participated in a social movement that created a unified atmosphere and advocated goals of social justice and equality. The community organization and the social values of the era have translated to the Environmental Justice movement.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Learning"/&gt;

===Similar goals and tactics===

The Environmental Justice movement and the Civil Rights Movement have many commonalities. At their core, the movements' goals are the same: "social justice, equal protection, and an end to institutional discrimination."  By stressing the similarities of the two movements, it emphasizes that environmental equity is a right for all citizens. Because the two movements have parallel goals, it is useful to employ similar tactics that often emerge on the grassroots level. Common confrontational strategies include protests, neighborhood demonstrations, picketing, political pressure, and demonstration.&lt;ref name="African American Community"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Existing organizations and leaders===

Just as the civil rights movement of the 1960s began in the South, the fight for environmental equity has been largely based in the South, where environmental discrimination is most prominent. In these southern communities, black churches and other voluntary associations are used to organize resistance efforts, including research and demonstrations, such as the protest in Warren County, North Carolina. As a result of the existing community structure, many church leaders and civil rights activists, such as Reverend [[Benjamin Chavis Muhammad]], have spearheaded the Environmental Justice movement.&lt;ref name="African American Community"/&gt;

[[The Bronx]], in New York City, has become a recent example of Environmental Justice succeeding. [[Majora Carter]] spearheaded the [[South Bronx Greenway]] Project, bringing local economic development, local [[urban heat island]] mitigation, positive social influences, [[Open Space Accessibility in California|access to public open space]], and aesthetically stimulating environments. The [[New York City Department of Design and Construction]] has recently recognized the value of the South Bronx Greenway design, and consequently utilized it as a widely distributed smart growth template. This venture is the ideal [[shovel-ready]] project with over $50 million in funding.&lt;ref name="southbronx"&gt;{{cite web

===Litigation===

Several of the most successful Environmental Justice lawsuits are based on violations of civil rights laws. The first case to use civil rights as a means to legally challenge the siting of a waste facility was in 1979. With the legal representation of Linda McKeever Bullard, the wife of Robert D. Bullard, residents of Houston's Northwood Manor opposed the decision of the city and Browning Ferris Industries to construct a solid waste facility near their mostly African-American neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Section 602 Lawsuits" /&gt;

In 1979, Northeast Community Action Group, or NECAG, was formed by African American homeowners in a suburban, middle income neighborhood in order to keep a landfill out of their home town. This group was the first organization that found the connection between race and pollution. The group, alongside their attorney Linda McKeever Bullard started the lawsuit Bean v. Southwestern Waste Management, Inc., which was the first of its kind to challenge the sitting of a waste facility under civil rights law.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Bullard, "Solid Waste Sites and the Black Houston Community," Sociological Inquiry 53 (Spring 1983): 273-288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, Robert. "Dismantling Toxic Racism." Crisis 1 July 2007: 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which was used many times to defend minority rights during the 1960s, has also been used in numerous Environmental Justice cases.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Learning"/&gt;

Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is often used in lawsuits that claim environmental inequality. The two most paramount sections in these cases are sections 601 and 602. Section 601 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin by any government agency receiving federal assistance. To win an Environmental Justice case that claims an agency violated this statute, the plaintiff must prove the agency intended to discriminate. Section 602 requires agencies to create rules and regulations that uphold section 601; in ''[[Alexander v. Sandoval]]'', the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs must also show intent to discriminate to successfully challenge the government under 602.

==Affected groups==

Among the affected groups of Environmental Justice, those in high-poverty and racial minority groups have the most propensity to receive the harm of environmental injustice. Poor people account for more than 20% of the human health impacts from industrial toxic air releases, compared to 12.9% of the population nationwide.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Racial/Ethnic Inequality in Environmental-Hazard Exposure in Metropolitan Los Angeles Manuel Pastor, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not account for the inequity found among individual minority groups. Some studies that test statistically for effects of race and ethnicity, while controlling for income and other factors, suggest racial gaps in exposure that persist across all bands of income.&lt;ref&gt;Justice in the Air: Tracking Toxic Pollution from America's Industries and Companies to Our States, Cities, and Neighborhoods Michael Ash, {{cite web|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/justice/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725114107/http://www.peri.umass.edu/justice/ |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

African-Americans are affected by a variety of Environmental Justice issues. One notorious example is the "[[Cancer Alley]]" region of Louisiana. This 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans is home to 125 companies that produce one quarter of the petrochemical products manufactured in the United States. The [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] has concluded that the African-American community has been disproportionately affected by Cancer Alley as a result of Louisiana's current state and local permit system for hazardous facilities, as well as their low socio-economic status and limited political influence.&lt;ref name="Shrader-Frechette 2002"&gt;Shrader-Frechette. 2002. ''Environmental Justice Creating Equality, Reclaiming Democracy''. Oxford University Press: New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; Another incidence of long-term environmental injustice occurred in the "West Grove" community of Miami, Florida. From 1925 to 1970, the predominately poor, African American residents of the "West Grove" endured the negative effects of exposure to carcinogenic emissions and toxic waste discharge from a large trash incinerator called Old Smokey.&lt;ref&gt;Alfieri, Anthony Victor, Paternalistic Interventions in Civil Rights and Poverty Law: A Case Study of Environmental Justice (November 14, 2013). Michigan Law Review, Vol. 112; University of Miami Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2014-3. Available at SSRN: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ssrn.com/abstract=2354382&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Despite official acknowledgement as a public nuisance, the incinerator project was expanded in 1961. It was not until the surrounding, predominantly white neighborhoods began to experience the negative impacts from Old Smokey that the legal battle began to close the incinerator.

Indigenous groups are often the victims of environmental injustices. [[Uranium mining and the Navajo people|Native Americans have suffered abuses related to uranium mining]] in the American West. Churchrock, New Mexico, in Navajo territory was home to the longest continuous uranium mining in any Navajo land. From 1954 until 1968, the tribe leased land to mining companies who did not obtain consent from Navajo families or report any consequences of their activities. Not only did the miners significantly deplete the limited water supply, but they also contaminated what was left of the Navajo water supply with uranium. Kerr-McGee and United Nuclear Corporation, the two largest mining companies, argued that the Federal Water Pollution Control Act did not apply to them, and maintained that Native American land is not subject to environmental protections. The courts did not force them to comply with US clean water regulations until 1980.&lt;ref name="Shrader-Frechette 2002"/&gt;

The most common example of environmental injustice among Latinos is the exposure to pesticides faced by farmworkers. After DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides were banned in the United States in 1972, farmers began using more acutely toxic organophosphate pesticides such as [[parathion]]. A large portion of farmworkers in the US are working as undocumented immigrants, and as a result of their political disadvantage, are not able to protest against regular exposure to pesticides or benefit from the protections of Federal laws.&lt;ref name="Shrader-Frechette 2002"/&gt; Exposure to chemical pesticides in the cotton industry also affects farmers in India and Uzbekistan. Banned throughout much of the rest of the world because of the potential threat to human health and the natural environment, [[Endosulfan]] is a highly toxic chemical, the safe use of which cannot be guaranteed in the many developing countries it is used in. [[Endosulfan]], like DDT, is an organochlorine and persists in the environment long after it has killed the target pests, leaving a deadly legacy for people and wildlife.&lt;ref name="ejfoundation.org"&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page246.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219205051/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page246.html |date=February 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of cities along the US-Mexico border are also affected. [[Maquiladora]]s are assembly plants operated by American, Japanese, and other foreign countries, located along the US-Mexico border. The maquiladoras use cheap Mexican labor to assemble imported components and raw material, and then transport finished products back to the United States. Much of the waste ends up being illegally dumped in sewers, ditches, or in the desert. Along the Lower [[Rio Grande Valley]], maquiladoras dump their toxic wastes into the river from which 95 percent of residents obtain their drinking water. In the border cities of [[Brownsville, Texas]] and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros, Mexico]], the rate of [[anencephaly]] (babies born without brains) is four times the national average.&lt;ref name=bullard&gt;Bullard, Robert D.

Web. &lt;http://www.unc.edu/courses/2005spring/epid/278/001/Bullard2000JSocIssues.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

States may also see placing toxic facilities near poor neighborhoods as preferential from a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) perspective. A CBA may favor placing a toxic facility near a city of 20,000 poor people than near a city of 5,000 wealthy people.&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, R., &amp; Phaedra, P. (2007). Environmental justice and environmentalism. (pp. 57-83).&lt;/ref&gt;  Terry Bossert of [[Range Resources]] reportedly has said that it deliberately locates its operations in poor neighbourhoods instead of wealthy areas where residents have more money to challenge its practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://powersource.post-gazette.com/powersource/latest-oil-and-gas/2016/04/18/Executive-s-remark-about-shale-gas-well-sites-prompts-sharp-criticism-calls-for-review/stories/201604180027 Range Resources exec's well-site remarks drawing sharp criticism: Does Range avoid rich neighborhoods?]—''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' (April 18, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Housing Discrimination in the East Bay|Northern California's East Bay Refinery Corridor]] is an example of the disparities associated with race and income and proximity to toxic facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fractracker.org/2016/03/north-coast-refinery-corridor/|title=Petrochemical Industry in East Bay North Coast Refinery Corridor|date=2016-03-30|work=FracTracker Alliance|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that environmental justice issues generally tend to affect women in communities more so than they affect men. This is due to the way that women typically interact more closely with their environments at home, such as through handling food preparation and childcare. Women also tend to be the leaders in environmental justice activist movements. Despite this, it tends not to be considered a mainstream feminist issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Karen|year=2016|title=Bread and Roses: A Gender Perspective on Environmental Justice and Public Health|url=|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.3390/ijerph13101005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government agencies==

===U.S. Department of Agriculture===

In its 2012 environmental justice strategy documents, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) stated an ongoing desire to integrate environmental justice into its core mission, internal operations and programming. It identified ambitious timeframes for action and promised improved efforts to highlight, track and coordinate EJ activities among its many sub-agencies. Agency-wide the USDA expanded its perspective on EJ, so that in addition to preventing disproportionate environmental impacts on EJ communities, USDA voiced a commitment to improve public participation processes and use its technical and financial assistance programs to improve the quality of life in all communities. In 2011, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack emphasized the USDA's focus on EJ in rural communities around the United States. USDA funds or implements many creative programs with social and environmental equity goals, however it has no staff dedicated solely to EJ, and faces the challenges of limited budgets and coordinating the efforts of a highly diverse agency.

====Background====

The USDA is the executive agency responsible for federal policy on food, agriculture, [[natural resources]], and [[quality of life]] in rural America.&lt;ref name="ftn1"&gt;USDA, Mission Statement, {{cite web |url=http://usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=MISSION_STATEMENT |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701232252/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=MISSION_STATEMENT |archivedate=2012-07-01 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The USDA has more than 100,000 employees and delivers over $96.5 billion in public services to programs worldwide.&lt;ref name="ftn2"&gt;USDA, Performance and Accountability Report at ii, http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/mimedetector?url=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf&amp;text=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100505073828/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/mimedetector?url=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf&amp;text=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf |date=2010-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfill its general mandate, USDA's departments are organized into seven mission areas:1) Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services; 2) Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services; 3) Food Safety; 4) Marketing and Regulatory Programs; 5) Natural Resources and Environment; 6) Research, Education and Economics and; 7) Rural Development.&lt;ref name="ftn3"&gt;USDA, Mission Areas, http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=USDA_MISSION_AREAS&amp;navtype=RT&amp;parentnav=AGENCIES_OFFICES.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, "Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations." Executive Order 12898 requires that achieving EJ must be part of each federal agency's mission. Agency programs, policies and activities can lead to health and environmental effects that disproportionately impact minority and low-income populations. Under Executive Order 12898 agencies must develop strategies that identify and address these effects by:

# promoting enforcement of all health and environmental statutes in areas with minority and low-income populations&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# ensuring greater [[public participation]]&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# improving research and data collection relating to the health and environment of minority and low-income populations&lt;nowiki&gt;; &lt;/nowiki&gt;and
# identifying differential patterns of [[resource consumption|consumption of natural resources]] among minority and low-income populations.

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that federal funds be used in a fair and equitable manner. Under Title VI any federal agency that receives federal funding cannot discriminate. Title VI also forbids federal agencies from providing grants or funding opportunities to programs that discriminate. An agency that violates Title VI can lose its federal funding.

Following E.O. 12898 and USDA's initial EJ strategic plan, USDA issued its internal Environmental Justice Department Regulation (DR 5600-002) in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002,{{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the definition of EJ was undergoing updates in 2012, DR 5600-002 defines environmental justice as "to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, all populations are provided the opportunity to comment before decisions are rendered on, are allowed to share in the benefits of, are not excluded from, and are not affected in a disproportionately high and adverse manner by, government programs and activities affecting human health or the environment."&lt;ref name="ftn5"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 4,{{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Holmes, Special Assistant to the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment at USDA, notes that this definition will be broadened in 2012 so that EJ also includes efforts to improve quality of life in all communities.&lt;ref name="ftn6"&gt;Patrick Homes, Special Assistant to the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment at USDA, interview with Shannon Kay Little(May 1, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, USDA will consider EJ to include avoiding adverse impacts ''and'' ensuring access to environmental benefits. Further, DR 5600-002 identified USDA's goals in implementing Executive Order 12898 as:

* To incorporate environmental justice considerations into USDA's programs and activities and to address environmental justice across mission areas&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* To identify, prevent, and/or mitigate, to the greatest extent practicable, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of USDA programs and activities on minority and low-income populations&lt;nowiki&gt;; &lt;/nowiki&gt;and

DR 5600-002 is "intended only to improve the internal management of USDA," and although it described concrete, mandatory actions by the agency, it did not establish new rights or benefits enforceable in court.&lt;ref name="ftn66"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 13, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack has stated a more concrete priority to fulfill its mission of environmental justice in rural areas.&lt;ref name="ftn60"&gt;Secretary Vilsack, State of Environmental Justice Speech, http://irjci.blogspot.com/2011/04/vilsack-those-interested-in.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012 Environmental Justice Strategy====

In compliance with the August 2011 Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Justice and Executive Order 12898 (MOU), USDA released a final Environmental Justice Strategic Plan: 2012 to 2014 on February 7, 2012 (Strategic Plan), which identifies new and updated goals and performance measures beyond what USDA identified in a 1995 EJ strategy it adopted in response to E.O. 12898.&lt;ref name="ftn10"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same week, it also released its first annual implementation progress report (Progress Report), as the MOU also required.&lt;ref name="ftn11"&gt;USDA, Progress Report, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary's message accompanying the Strategic Plan described two immediate tasks: 1) each agency within USDA is required to identify a point of contact for EJ issues, at the Senior Executive Service (SES) level; and 2) each agency must develop its own EJ strategy prior to April 15, 2012, and begin implementing it as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="ftn31"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 3, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2012, it did not appear that such strategies had been made public, although sub-agencies provided internal reports to the USDA's EJ steering committee on April 9, 2012, according to Holmes.&lt;nowiki&gt; The Secretary's message contained strong language that, "Given that USDA programs touch almost every American every day, the Department is well positioned to help in [the environmental justice] effort."&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn31"/&gt; USDA has determined that it can achieve the requirements of the Executive Order by integrating EJ into its programs, rather than implementing new and costly programs.&lt;ref name="ftn14"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 4, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The agency took this same approach in an EJ strategy it adopted in 1995.&lt;ref name="ftn15"&gt;USDA, 1995 Strategy at 3, {{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/resources/publications/interagency/usda-strategy-1995.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111061339/http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/resources/publications/interagency/usda-strategy-1995.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, such as agricultural chemicals and effects to migrant workers, USDA reviews its practices to identify potential disproportionate, adverse impacts on EJ communities, according to Blake Velde, Senior Environmental Scientist with the USDA Hazardous Materials Management Division.&lt;ref name="ftn16"&gt;Blake Velde, Senior Environmental Scientist with the USDA Hazardous Materials Management Division, interview with Shannon Kay Little (April 25, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, however, USDA believes its existing technical and financial assistance programs provide solutions to environmental inequity, such as its initiatives on education, food deserts, and economic development in impacted communities, and ensuring access to environmental benefits is the focus of USDA's EJ efforts.

Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) Under Secretary Harris Sherman is the political appointee generally responsible for USDA's EJ strategy, with Patrick Holmes, a senior staffer to the Under Secretary, playing a coordinating role. Although USDA has no staff dedicated solely to EJ, its sub-agencies have many offices dedicated to civil rights compliance, outreach and communication and environmental review whose responsibilities incorporate EJ issues.&lt;ref name="ftn68"&gt;Holmes interview.&lt;/ref&gt; The Strategic Plan was developed with the input of an Environmental Justice Working Group, made up of staff and leadership representing the USDA's seven mission areas and the SES-level contacts, which were appointed in early 2012, serve as a steering committee for the agency's efforts.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; The Strategic Plan is organized according to six goals, which were purposefully left broad, and lists specific objectives and agency performance measures under each goal. The details and specific implementation of many of these programs and the performance measures are left to the departments and sub-agencies to develop.&lt;ref name="ftn19"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 5, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The six goals are to:

* Ensure USDA programs provide opportunities for EJ communities.
* Provide targeted training and capacity-building to EJ communities.
* Expand public participation in agency activities, to enhance the "credibility and public trust" of the USDA.
* Ensure USDA's activities do not have disproportionately high and adverse human health impacts, and resolve environmental justice issues and complaints.
* Increase the awareness of EJ issues among USDA employees.
* Update and/or Develop Departmental and Agency Regulations on EJ.

The Strategic Plan also lists existing programs that either currently support the goal, or are expected to in the future. According to Holmes, some of the challenges of the Strategic Plan process have stemmed from the diverse programs and missions that the agency serves, limitations on staff time, and budgets.&lt;ref name="ftn20"&gt;Holmes interview. With regards to budgets, Holmes noted that in April 2012 the USDA's Programs for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers, which provides loans to women, African Americans, American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for farm and ranch property purchases, improvements and soil and water conservation projects, was facing a loss of its entire $75 million budget in the Farm Bill.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental Justice initiatives====

The Strategic Plan requires that EJ must be integrated into the strategies and evaluations for sub-agencies' technical and financial assistance programs.&lt;ref name="ftn34"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 5, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; It also emphasizes public participation, community capacity-building, EJ awareness and training within the USDA.

=====Transparency, accountability, accessibility and community participation=====

A stated goal of USDA's Strategic Plan is to expand public participation in agency activities, to enhance the "credibility and public trust" of the USDA.&lt;ref name="ftn22"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 9, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the agency will update its public participation guidelines to include EJ, beginning this process by April 15, 2012. The Strategic Plan emphasizes capacity-building in EJ communities, and includes objectives that emphasize communication between USDA and environmental justice communities, including Tribal consultation. Sub-agencies must announce schedules for training programs in EJ communities and to develop new, preliminary outreach materials on USDA programs by April 15, 2012.&lt;ref name="ftn23"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 7, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional performance standard is to encourage EJ communities to participate in the NEPA process, an effort the Strategic Plan requires on or before February 29, 2012,&lt;ref name="ftn24"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 10, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; although the Strategic Plan does not articulate a standard by which this could be measured. The Strategic Plan also reiterates compliance with the Executive Orders on Tribal consultation and outreach to non-proficient English speakers, and seeks more diverse representation on regional forest advisory committees. [community participation, outreach]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Generally, the USDA's process for developing the Strategic Plan demonstrates a commitment to public involvement. The USDA EJ documents are currently housed obscurely within the Departmental Management section of the USDA website, under the Hazardous Materials Management Division, although the agency plans to update its entire site in 2012 and create a more robust EJ page.&lt;ref name="ftn25"&gt;USDA, Brownfields Environmental Justice, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/brownfields.htm&lt;nowiki&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226175222/http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/brownfields.htm |date=February 26, 2012 }}; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Velde interview.&lt;/ref&gt; The Strategic Plan was released in draft form in December 2011 for a 30-day public comment period, and responses to general types of comments received are in the Progress Report, although the comments themselves are not online.&lt;ref name="ftn26"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 3-7, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf Report.&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary's message accompanying the Strategic Plan requests that organizations and individuals to continue to contact USDA with comments on the Strategic Plan and to identify USDA programs that have been the most beneficial to their communities.&lt;ref name="ftn31"/&gt; The agency has a dedicated email address for this purpose. Agency leadership has asked its sub-agencies to prepare responses to additional comments that have been received, and the agency will release an interim progress report, prior to winter 2013.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[community participation, outreach, education]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=====Internal evaluation and training=====

The Strategic Plan also seeks to increase the awareness of environmental justice issues among USDA employees.&lt;ref name="ftn29"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 12-13, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; The Strategic Plan does not list any existing programs in this area, but does list a series of performance measures going forward, most of which must be met by April 15, 2012. The measures include environmental justice trainings, new web pages, and potential revisions to staff manuals and handbooks. Sub-agencies began reviewing their existing training in 2012 and in their April 9, 2012 reports to the USDA EJ steering committee, sub-agencies were asked to describe their goals for enhanced EJ training.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; This internal, educational undertaking appears to be new in the 2012 Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan targets Responsible Officials, meaning office and program managers, for the trainings, as well as the SES-level points of contact required by the Secretary's message. [education, study, compliance and enforcement]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The EJ Strategy tasked each sub-agency with developing its own EJ strategy document by spring 2012, although as of May 2012 the sub-agencies were still in an evaluation stage and had not issued final documents.&lt;ref name="ftn31"/&gt; For many sub-agencies, the 2012 process has been their first focused assessment of their EJ impact and opportunities.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; Going forward, sub-agencies will submit twice-yearly reports to NRE about their implementation of the Strategic Plan's goals; the first of these was due April 9, 2012, and as of May 2012, the USDA's EJ steering committee was evaluating the first reports.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;

=====Establishment of performance metrics=====

As part of its effort to ensure that EJ communities have the opportunity to participate in USDA programs, the Strategic Plan requires each sub-agency to set measurements through which it can track increased EJ community participation in USDA technical and financial assistance programs.&lt;ref name="ftn34"/&gt; This must be done by April 15, 2012. As of late April 2012, the sub-agencies were still in the process of describing a baseline of current activities and determining the metrics to evaluate improvement, such as staff time, grant funding or increased programming.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; The ultimate metrics are likely to be somewhat subjective, and must be flexible given the broad range of undertakings by the sub-agencies.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; Also related to evaluation, the Strategic Plan requires the sub-agencies to determine an effective methodology with which they can evaluate whether USDA programs have disproportionate impacts.&lt;ref name="ftn37"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 11, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [study, redressing environmental racism, compliance and enforcement]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=====Other EJ initiatives=====

======Tribal outreach======

USDA has had a role in implementing Michelle Obama's ''Let's Move'' campaign in Tribal Areas, by increasing participation by Bureau of Indian Education schools in Federal nutrition programs, in the development of community gardens on Tribal lands, and in the development of Tribal food policy councils.&lt;ref name="ftn38"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This is combined with measures to provide Rural Development funding for community infrastructure in Indian Country.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [children's issues, education, diet, grants, Native Americans, public health].&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) is working to update its policy on protection and management of Native American Sacred Sites, an effort that has included listening sessions and government-to-government consultation.&lt;ref name="ftn78"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 10, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has also consulted with Tribes regarding management of reintroduced of species, where Tribes may have a history of subsistence-level hunting of those species. Meanwhile, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is exploring a program to use meat from bisons raised on Tribal land to supply AMS food distribution programs to Tribes.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [Native Americans, diet, subsistence, community participation]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The Intertribal Technical Assistance Network works to improve access of Tribal governments, communities and individuals to USDA technical assistance programs.&lt;ref name="ftn50"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 8, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

======Technical and financial assistance to farmers======

The Progress Report highlights the NRCS Strike Force Initiative, which has identified impoverished counties in Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas to receive increased outreach and training regarding USDA assistance programs. USDA credits this increased outreach with generating a 196 percent increase in contracts, representing more than 250,000 acres of farmland, in its Environmental Quality Incentives Program.&lt;ref name="ftn50"/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [economic benefit, equitable development, grants, outreach, ej as evaluation criteria] NRCS works with &lt;/nowiki&gt;"private landowners protect their natural resources"&lt;ref name="ftn44"&gt;USDA, NRCS EJ Guidance at 1, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1045586.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; through conservation planning and assistance with the goal of maintaining "productive lands and healthy ecosystems."&lt;ref name="ftn45"&gt;USDA, About NRCS, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/about NRCS.&lt;/ref&gt; NRCS has its own civil rights compliance guidance document, and in 2001 NRCS funded and published a study, "Environmental Justice: Perceptions of Issues, Awareness and Assistance," focused on rural, Southern "Black Belt" counties and analyzing how the NRCS workforce could more effectively integrate environmental justice into impacted communities.&lt;ref name="ftn46"&gt;USDA, NRCS EJ Guidance, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1045586.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [compliance and enforcement, redressing environmental racism, grants, study, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The Farm Services Agency in 2011 devoted $100,000 of its Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers program budget to improving its outreach to counties with persistent poverty, including improving its materials and building relationships with local universities and community groups.&lt;ref name="ftn47"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 9, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [economic benefit, equitable development, grants, outreach, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In addition, USDA's Risk Management Agency has initiated education and outreach to low-income farmers regarding use of biological controls, rather than pesticides, for pest control, efforts that the agency believes are valuable in the face of climate change.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [climate change, agricultural chemicals, education]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

======Green jobs and capacity building======

A 2011 MOU between a USDA sub-agency, the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) and the American Indian Science and Engineering Society that aims to increase the number of Native Americans entering the FSIS career path;&lt;ref name="ftn49"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 9, [http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf Report].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [education, community participation, economic benefit, green jobs, Native Americans, diet, interagency collaboration]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

A partnership between APHIS and the Rural Coalition (Coalicion)--an alliance of regionally and culturally diverse organizations working to build a more just and sustainable food system. The partnership focuses on outreach, fair returns to minority and other small farmers and rural communities, farmworker working conditions, environmental protection and food safety.&lt;ref name="ftn50"/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [agricultural chemicals, community participation, diet, economic benefit, outreach, improving health and safety, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

USFS is also funding pilot initiatives, such as its Urban Water Ambassadors, summer internship positions for youth who coordinate and implement urban tree planting projects.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; In 2011, USFS provided a grant to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources that funded 14 summer jobs for youth in Baltimore to work on urban watershed restoration programs.&lt;ref name="ftn52"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 8-9, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf Report.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [community participation, green jobs, mapping, water]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

======Mapping======

USFS has established several Urban Field Stations, to research urban natural resources' structure, function, stewardship, and benefits.&lt;ref name="ftn54"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 6, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; By mapping urban tree coverage, the agency hopes to identify and prioritize EJ communities for urban forest projects.&lt;ref name="ftn54"/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [community education, mapping, diet, improving health and safety, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Another initiative highlighted by the agency is the Food and Nutrition Service and Economic Research Service's Food Desert Locator.&lt;ref name="ftn55"&gt;USDA, Food Desert Locator, http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/FoodDesert/.&lt;/ref&gt; The Locator provides a spatial view of food deserts, defined as a low-income census tract where a substantial number or share of residents has low access to a supermarket or large grocery store. It also shows, by census tract, the number and percentage of certain populations, such as children, seniors, or households without a vehicle, with low access to grocery stores. The mapped deserts can be used to direct agency resources to increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables and other food assistance programs, according to Blake Velde, an agency scientist and spokesperson on EJ issues.&lt;ref name="ftn56"&gt;Velde interview.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [diet, mapping, improving health and safety, study, ej as evaluation criteria, services and data available to others]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

======Rural outreach======

USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack has placed a clear emphasis on supporting EJ in rural areas.&lt;ref name="ftn60"/&gt; Although&lt;nowiki&gt; "often the highest profile battles on [environmental justice] issue[s] are waged in at-risk neighborhoods in major cities or at Superfund sites located near populated urban and &lt;/nowiki&gt;suburban areas" Vilsack highlighted the often overlooked rural areas where environmental justice is largely ignored.&lt;ref name="ftn60"/&gt;

Through its Rural Utilities Service, the USDA supports a number of Water and Environmental Programs. These programs work to administer water and wastewater loans or grants to rural areas and cities to support water and wastewater, stormwater and solid waste disposal systems, including SEARCH grants that are targeted to financially distressed, small rural communities and other opportunities specifically for Alaskan Native villages and designated Colonias.;&lt;ref name="ftn59"&gt;USDA, Water and Environmental Programs Fact Sheet, {{cite web|url=http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/SupportDocuments/RUS%20Fact%20Sheet%201806%20new.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625211242/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/SupportDocuments/RUS%20Fact%20Sheet%201806%20new.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USDA, Water and Environmental Programs Website, http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/UWEP_HomePage.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech, Secretary Vilsack said that the USDA funded 2,575 clean water projects in rural areas during a two-year period to address problems ranging from wastewater treatment to sewage treatment.&lt;ref name="ftn60"/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [water, land use, compliance and enforcement, improving health and safety, pollution cleanup, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The USDA also supports the Rural Energy for America Grant Program. This program provides grants and loans to farmers, ranchers and rural small businesses to finance renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements.&lt;ref name="ftn61"&gt;USDA, Rural Energy Grants, {{cite web |url=http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/busp/9006grant.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620054541/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/busp/9006grant.htm |archivedate=2012-06-20 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[grants, economic benefit, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

====Regulations or Formalized EJ Guidelines====

In 1997 the USDA promulgated a departmental regulation providing "direction to&lt;nowiki&gt; [&lt;/nowiki&gt;sub-]agencies for integrating environmental justice considerations into USDA programs and activities" (DR 5600-002).&lt;ref name="ftn62"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 1, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Issuance of this regulation was a primary goal of USDA's 1995 EJ strategy document.&lt;ref name="ftn63"&gt;USDA, 1995 Strategy at 4, {{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/resources/publications/interagency/usda-strategy-1995.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111061339/http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/resources/publications/interagency/usda-strategy-1995.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; DR 5600-002 includes guidelines for consideration of EJ in the NEPA process, but also stated that "efforts to address environmental justice are not limited to NEPA compliance."&lt;ref name="ftn64"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 6.b., {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It requires evaluation of activities for potential disproportionate EJ impacts, outreach, and performance-metric based evaluation and reporting on sub-agencies' implementation of EJ goals.&lt;ref name="ftn65"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Secs. 6-10, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; DR 5600-002 is a forward-looking, permanent directive that applies to all USDA programs and activities. However, it was not published in the Federal Register as a formal rulemaking and does not create a private right of action or enforcement tool.&lt;ref name="ftn66"/&gt; A Strategic Plan goal is to update this regulation, as well as other departmental regulations and policies on EJ.&lt;ref name="ftn67"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 13,[http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan].&lt;/ref&gt; According to USDA, the EJ definition in DR 5600-002 will be modified in 2012—EJ to include measures to avoid disproportionate negative impacts as well as quality-of-life improvements that the agency believes can benefit impacted communities.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;

The Strategic Plan also has established a performance standard requiring that existing and new USDA regulations are evaluated for EJ impacts or benefits.&lt;ref name="ftn69"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 11,[http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan].&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-agencies are required to develop a process for this evaluation by April 15, 2012. This performance standard reflects a requirement in DR 5600-002 that required the USDA departmental regulation on rulemaking, DR 1521-1, to be revised to require an EJ evaluation in the rulemaking process.&lt;ref name="ftn70"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 11, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, DR 1521-1 requires that a cost-benefit analysis of major human health, safety and environmental regulations include analysis of risks to "persons who are disproportionately exposed or particularly sensitive," although DR 1521-1 does not mention EJ or impacts to minority or low-income communities explicitly.&lt;ref name="ftn71"&gt;USDA, DR 1521-1, Sec. 6.c(3), http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR1521-001.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[Land Use - permitting, community participation, compliance and enforcement, study]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

====Enforcement====

The Strategic Plan sets an enforcement-specific goal, which includes objectives to "effectively resolve or adjudicate all environmental justice-related Title VI complaints" and to include environmental justice as a key component of civil rights compliance reviews.&lt;ref name="ftn72"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 11, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; Agencies are also required to identify an assessment methodology by April 15, 2012, which can be used to determine whether programs have disproportionately high and adverse environmental and human health impacts. The NRCS has published and updated a Civil Rights Compliance Review Guide, which guides the NRCS Civil Rights Division's review of the compliance with Title VI and 12898 in the agency's state offices, field offices and other facilities.&lt;ref name="ftn73"&gt;USDA, NRCS Civil Rights Compliance Guide at 4, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1046364.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The guide was updated in November 2011 and it does not mention EJ explicitly.&lt;ref name="ftn74"&gt;USDA, NRCS Civil Rights Compliance Guide, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1046364.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Strategic Plan identifies the NRCS compliance review and other outreach and research programs as supporting its EJ enforcement goals.&lt;ref name="ftn75"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 12, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [compliance and enforcement]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

====NEPA====

The 1997 Regulation, DR 5600-2 required USDA sub-agencies to develop their own NEPA environmental justice guidance documents.&lt;ref name="ftn76"&gt;USDA, DR5600-2, Sec. 8, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-agencies have done so, with some additional details, such as a reminder that the EJ community should be involved in identifying the alternatives, suggested stakeholders and resources, and guidance to hold meetings at times when working people can get to them, and to translate notices.&lt;ref name="ftn77"&gt;USDA, RUS Environmental Guidance at 44, 67, {{cite web|url=http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/me/Misc/1794A-602.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224000332/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/me/Misc/1794A-602.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-24 |df= }} Guidance.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when DR 5600-02 is updated as required by the Strategic Plan, changes could be made to the NEPA section of the Regulation. The Strategic Plan sets a performance standard to encourage interested environmental justice communities to be involved in the public participation process for NEPA documents, although the Strategic Plan does not require updates to the NEPA portions of DR 5600-02.&lt;ref name="ftn78"/&gt;

Although the USDA has integrated EJ into each step of the NEPA process as required by Executive Order 12898, many of the NEPA documents completed by the USDA include only cursory analysis of environmental justice effects. This analysis most often includes a rote paragraph as to what Executive Order 12898 requires and a quick conclusion that the agency action does not affect minority and low-income populations. Some examples where the USDA included more in-depth analysis are:

* Descriptions of the minority and low-income populations that live in the study area&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn79"&gt;USDA, NRCS Logan Canal EJ Analysis, {{cite web |url=http://www.ut.nrcs.usda.gov/programs/EWP/LNCRP/data/Draft_EIS/Chapters/Appendices/7_LNCR-DEIS_appC4-demographics.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218170717/http://www.ut.nrcs.usda.gov/programs/EWP/LNCRP/data/Draft_EIS/Chapters/Appendices/7_LNCR-DEIS_appC4-demographics.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permitting====

The USDA does not have any permitting initiatives specific to EJ.

====Title VI====

The USDA has an Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights whose mission it is to provide leadership and direction "for the fair and equitable treatment of all USDA customers."&lt;ref name="ftn81"&gt;USDA, OASCR Website, http://www.ascr.usda.gov/.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the USDA revised DR 4300-4, internal regulations requiring a Civil Rights Impact Analysis of all "policies, actions or decisions" affecting the USDA's federally conducted and federally assisted programs or activities.&lt;ref name="ftn82"&gt;USDA, DR4300-4, Sec. 3.b., {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR4300-4.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625183740/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR4300-4.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis is used to determine the "scope, intensity, direction, duration, and significance of the effects of an agency's proposed ... policies, actions or decisions."&lt;ref name="ftn83"&gt;USDA, DR4300-4, Sec. 3.c., {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR4300-4.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625183740/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR4300-4.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; USDA's departmental regulation on EJ, DR 5600-002, required DR 4300-4 to be revised to "require that Civil Rights Impact Analyses include a finding as to whether proposed or new actions have or do not have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on the human health or the environment of minority populations, and whether such effects can be prevented or mitigated".&lt;ref name="ftn84"&gt;USDA, DR5600-002, Sec. 11, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although DR 4300-4 was revised in 2003, the revised regulation does not explicitly require a finding on adverse environmental or health impacts. &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;study, compliance and enforcement]

===Right-to-know movement===
{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}
A new movement, bent on educating the people, was born after the [[Bhopal disaster]], called the "[[Right to know|right-to-know]]" movement. A series of laws and reports was created, all built to inform the people of the [[pollutant]]s being dumped into our{{Who|date=August 2015}} neighborhoods and atmosphere, and exactly how much of each chemical is being exposed and dumped. The theory behind "right-to-know" is that once people are informed on what is polluting their neighborhood, then they will begin to take action in both bringing down their own emissions, as well as begin to make the companies causing the most pollution, through means such as protests, to take into account their actions.

====Emergency Planning and Right to Know Act of 1986====
After the [[Bhopal disaster]], where a Union Carbide plant released forty tons of [[methyl isocyanate]] into the atmosphere in a village just south of Bhopal, India, the U.S. government passed the [[Emergency Planning and Right to Know Act of 1986]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/epcra/what-epcra|title=What is EPCRA?|work=epa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Introduced by Henry Waxman, the act required all corporations to report their toxic chemical pollution annually, which was then gathered into a report known as the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program|title=Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program|work=epa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program|url=http://www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program|website=epa.gov|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By collecting this data, the government was able to make sure that companies were no longer releasing excessive amounts of deadly toxins into populated areas, so to prevent another incident like that of the thousands of people killed and the tens of thousands of people injured in the Bhopal disaster.

====Corporate Toxics Information Report====
The Corporate Toxics Information Project (CTIP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/ctip_research/|title=PERI: Corporate Toxics Information Project|work=umass.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629000817/http://www.peri.umass.edu/ctip_research/|archivedate=2015-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Toxics Information Project|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/ctip_research/|website=PERI|publisher=Political Economy Research Institute|accessdate=27 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629000817/http://www.peri.umass.edu/ctip_research/|archivedate=29 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded on the guidelines that they will "[develop] and [disseminate] information and analysis on corporate releases of pollutants and the consequences for communities". The overarching goal was to help take corporations into account for their pollution habits, by collecting information and putting it in databases so to make it available to the general public. The four goals of the project were to develop 1) corporate rankings, 2) regional reports, based on state, region, and metropolitan areas, 3) industry reports, based on industrial sectors, and 4) to create a web-based resource open to the entire population, that can depict all the collected data. The data collection would be done by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA|url=http://www.epa.gov/|website=epa.gov|publisher=EPA|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then analyzed and disseminated by the PERI institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peri.umass.edu/]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest projects of CTIP was the Toxic 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic_archive/ |title=PERI: Archive: Toxic 100 Air Polluters Index |work=umass.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629013855/http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic_archive/ |archivedate=2015-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toxics 100 |url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic_archive/ |website=PERI |publisher=Political Economy Research Institute |accessdate=27 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629013855/http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic_archive/ |archivedate=29 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Toxic 100 is an index of the top 100 air polluters around the United States in terms of the country's largest corporations. The list is based on the EPA's Risk Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI), which "assesses the chronic human health risk from industrial toxic releases", as well as the [[Toxics Release Inventory]] (TRI), which is where the corporations must report their chemical releases to the US government. Since its original publishing date in 2004, the Toxic 100 has been updated four more times, with the latest publishing date being August 2013.

==Around the world==
{{Green politics sidebar |Related}}

In recent years environmental justice campaigns have also emerged in other parts of the world, such as India, South Africa, Israel, Nigeria, Mexico, Hungary, Uganda, and the United Kingdom. In Europe for example, there is evidence to suggest that the [[Romani people]] and other minority groups of non-European descent are suffering from environmental inequality and discrimination.&lt;ref name="capacity.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.capacity.org.uk/downloads/snapshot_for_ej.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920234947/http://www.capacity.org.uk/downloads/snapshot_for_ej.pdf |date=September 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Making the Case for Environmental Justice in Central and Eastern Europe|last = Steger, T. (ed.)|first = |publisher = CEU, CEPL and HEAL|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Budapest and Brussels|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
''For further information, see [[Environmental racism in Europe]]''

In Europe, the [[Romani people]]s are ethnic minorities and differ from the rest of the European people by their culture, language, and history. The environmental discrimination that they experience ranges from the unequal distribution of environmental harms as well as the unequal distribution of education, health services and employment. In many countries Romani peoples are forced to live in the slums because many of the laws to get residence permits are discriminatory against them. This forces Romani people to live in urban "ghetto" type housing or in shantytowns. In the Czech Republic and Romania, the Romani peoples are forced to live in places that have less access to running water and sewage, and in Ostrava, Czech Republic, the Romani people live in apartments located above an abandoned mine, which emits methane. Also in Bulgaria, the public infrastructure extends throughout the town of Sofia until it reaches the Romani village where there is very little water access or sewage capacity.&lt;ref name="Steger, 2008"&gt;Steger, Tamara and Richard Filcak. 2009. ''Articulating the basis for Promoting Environmental Justice in Central and Eastern Europe''. Environmental Justice: Volume 1, Number 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union is trying to strive towards environmental justice by putting into effect declarations that state that all people have a right to a healthy environment. The Stockholm Declaration, the 1987 [[Brundtland Commission]]'s Report&amp;nbsp;– "[[Our Common Future]]", the [[Rio Declaration]], and Article 37 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], all are ways that the Europeans have put acts in place to work toward environmental justice.&lt;ref name="Steger, 2008"/&gt; Europe also funds action-oriented projects that work on furthering Environmental Justice throughout the world. For example, '''EJOLT''' ('''Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and Trade''') is a large multinational project supported through the FP7 Science in Society budget line from the [[European Commission]].{{Elucidate|date=March 2012}} From March 2011 to March 2015, 23 civil society organizations and universities from 20 countries in Europe, Africa, Latin-America, and Asia are, and have promised to work together on advancing the cause of Environmental Justice. EJOLT is building up case studies, linking organisations worldwide, and making an interactive global map of Environmental Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejolt.org/ |title=Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and Trade |publisher=EJOLT |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====

Sweden became the first country to ban [[Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane|DDT]] in 1969 due to the efforts of women protesting its usage in forests. In the 1980s, women activists organized around preparing jam made from pesticide-tainted berries, which they offered to the members of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWEZCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA293&amp;ots=vwscYvzeSK&amp;dq=sweden%20jam%20berries%20pesticides&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=sweden&amp;f=false|title=Women Pioneers For The Environment|last=Breton|first=Mary Joy|date=2016-02-01|publisher=Northeastern University Press|isbn=9781555538552|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Radical Ecology: The Search for a Livable World|last=Merchant|first=Carolyn|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=978-0415935784|location=New York, NY|pages=193|quote=In Sweden, feminists prepare jam from berries sprayed with herbicides and offer a taste to members of parliament: they refuse.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament members refused, and this has often been cited as an example of direct action within [[ecofeminism]].

====United Kingdom====

Whilst the predominant agenda of the Environmental Justice movement in the United States has been tackling issues of race, inequality, and the environment, environmental justice campaigns around the world have developed and shifted in focus. For example, the EJ movement in the United Kingdom is quite different. It focuses on issues of poverty and the environment, but also tackles issues of [[health inequalities]] and [[social exclusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/environmental_justice.pdf|format=PDF|title=Environmental justice: Rights and means to a healthy environment for all|publisher=ESRC Global Environmental Change Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt; A UK-based NGO, named the [[Environmental Justice Foundation]], has sought to make a direct link between the need for environmental security and the defense of basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejfoundation.org/page231.html |title=About Us |publisher=Environmental Justice Foundation |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907052127/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page231.html |archivedate=2012-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have launched several high profile campaigns that link environmental problems and social injustices. A campaign against illegal, unreported and unregulated ([[IUU]]) fishing highlighted how 'pirate' fisherman are stealing food from local, artisanal fishing communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/08/pirate-fishing-eco-disaster-report "Pirate fishing causing eco disaster and killing communities, says report"] The Guardian, June 8th 2009, retrieved 8th October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EJF. 2005.

Environmental Justice Foundation, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; They have also launched a campaign exposing the environmental and human rights abuses involved in cotton production in [[Uzbekistan]]. [[Cotton produced in Uzbekistan]] is often [[harvested by children]] for little or no pay. In addition, the mismanagement of water resources for crop irrigation has led to the near eradication of the [[Aral Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejfoundation.org/page142.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410221416/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page142.html |archivedate=2010-04-10 |df= }}"Cotton in Uzbekistan: Environmental Justice Foundation"&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Justice Foundation has successfully petitioned large retailers such as [[Wal-mart]] and [[Tesco]] to stop selling [[Uzbek cotton]].&lt;ref name="Mathiason"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/may/24/retail-ethicalbusiness | title=Uzbekistan forced to stop child labor | work=[[The Observer]] | date=May 24, 2009 | accessdate=May 14, 2016 | author=Mathiason, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Building of alternatives to climate change====

In [[France]], numerous [[Alternatiba, Village of Alternatives|Alternatiba]] events, or villages of alternatives, are providing hundreds of alternatives to [[climate change]] and lack of environmental justice, both in order to raise people's awareness and to stimulate behaviour change. They have been or will be organized in over sixty different French and European cities, such as [[Bilbao]], [[Brussels]], [[Geneva]], [[Lyon]] or [[Paris]].

===South Africa===

Under colonial and [[apartheid]] governments in South Africa, thousands of black South Africans were removed from their ancestral lands to make way for game parks. Earthlife Africa was formed in 1988 (www.earthlife.org.za), making it Africa's first environmental justice organisation. In 1992, the Environmental Justice Networking Forum (EJNF), a nationwide umbrella organization designed to coordinate the activities of environmental activists and organizations interested in social and environmental justice, was created. By 1995, the network expanded to include 150 member organizations and by 2000, it included over 600 member organizations.&lt;ref name=southafrica/&gt;

With the election of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in 1994, the environmental justice movement gained an ally in government. The ANC noted "poverty and environmental degradation have been closely linked" in South Africa.{{Attribution needed|date=March 2012}} The ANC made it clear that environmental inequalities and injustices would be addressed as part of the party's post-apartheid reconstruction and development mandate. The new South African Constitution, finalized in 1996, includes a Bill of Rights that grants South Africans the right to an "environment that is not harmful to their health or well-being" and "to have the environment protected, for the benefit of present and future generations through reasonable legislative and other measures that
#prevent pollution and ecological degradation;
#promote conservation; and
#secure [[ecologically sustainable development]] and use of natural resources while promoting justifiable economic and social development".&lt;ref name=southafrica&gt;McDonald, David A. Environmental Justice in South Africa. Cape Town: Ohio UP, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa's mining industry is the largest single producer of [[solid waste]], accounting for about two-thirds of the total waste stream.{{Vague|date=March 2012}} Tens of thousands of deaths have occurred among mine workers as a result of accidents over the last century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} There have been several deaths and debilitating diseases from work-related illnesses like [[asbestosis]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} For those who live next to a mine, the quality of air and water is poor. Noise, dust, and dangerous equipment and vehicles can be threats to the safety of those who live next to a mine as well.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These communities are often poor and black and have little choice over the placement of a mine near their homes. The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] introduced a new Minerals Act that began to address environmental considerations by recognizing the health and safety concerns of workers and the need for land rehabilitation during and after mining operations. In 1993, the Act was amended to require each new mine to have an Environmental Management Program Report (EMPR) prepared before breaking ground. These EMPRs were intended to force mining companies to outline all the possible environmental impacts of the particular mining operation and to make provision for environmental management.&lt;ref name=southafrica/&gt;

In October 1998, the Department of Minerals and Energy released a White Paper entitled ''A Minerals and Mining Policy for South Africa'', which included a section on Environmental Management. The White Paper states "Government, in recognition of the responsibility of the State as custodian of the nation's natural resources, will ensure that the essential development of the country's mineral resources will take place within a framework of sustainable development and in accordance with national environmental policy, norms, and standards". It adds that any environmental policy "must ensure a cost-effective and competitive mining industry."&lt;ref name=southafrica/&gt;

===Australia===

In Australia, the "Environmental Justice Movement" is not defined as it is in the United States. Australia does have some discrimination mainly in the siting of hazardous waste facilities in areas where the people are not given proper information about the company. The injustice that takes place in Australia is defined as environmental politics on who get the unwanted waste site or who has control over where factory opens up. The movement towards equal environmental politics focuses more on who can fight for companies to build, and takes place in the parliament; whereas, in the United States Environmental Justice is trying to make nature safer for all people.&lt;ref name="Arcioni, 2005"&gt;Arcioni, Elisa and Mitchell, Glenn(2005).''Environmental Justice in Australia: When RATS became IRATE''. Environmental Politics. Volume 14 Issue 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecuador===

An example of the environmental injustices that indigenous groups face can be seen in the [[Chevron-Texaco incident]] in the [[Amazon rainforest]]. [[Texaco]], which is now Chevron, found oil in Ecuador in 1964 and built sub-standard oil wells to cut costs.&lt;ref name="chevrontoxico1"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Rainforest Chernobyl|url=http://chevrontoxico.com/about/rainforest-chernobyl/|publisher=ChevronToxico|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deliberately used inferior technology to make their operations cheaper, even if detrimental to the local people and environment. After the company left in 1992, they left approximately one thousand [[toxic waste]] pits open and dumped billions of gallons of toxic water into the rivers.&lt;ref name="chevrontoxico1"/&gt;

===South Korea===

[[South Korea]] has a relatively short history of environmental justice compared to other countries in the west. As a result of rapid [[industrialization]], people started to have awareness on pollution, and from the environmental discourses the idea of environmental justice appeared. The concept of environmental justice appeared in South Korea in late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article%3D2941%26context%3Detd |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424040456/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2941&amp;context=etd |archivedate=2015-04-24 |df= }}''Lee, Hosuk.(2009) Political Ecology of Environmental Justice : Environmental struggle &amp; Injustice in the Yeongheung island Coal Plant Controversy. The Florida State University DigiNole Commons'', Accessed 2015-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea experienced rapid economic growth (which is commonly referred to as the '[[Miracle on the Han River]]') in the 20th century as a result of industrialization policies adapted by [[Park Chung-hee]] after 1970s. The policies and social environment had no room for environmental discussions, which aggravated the pollution in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aks.ac.kr/home/index.do]''The Academy of Korean Studies : Economy'', Accessed 2015-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental movements in South Korea started from [[air pollution]] campaigns. As the notion of environment pollution spread, the focus on environmental activism shifted from existing pollution to preventing future pollution, and the organizations eventually started to criticize the government policies that are neglecting the environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=572765&amp;cid=46634&amp;categoryId=46634]''The Academy of Korean Studies : Environmental Movement'', Accessed 2015-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of environmental justice was introduced in South Korea among the discussions of environment after 1990s. While the environmental organizations analyzed the condition of pollution in South Korea, they noticed that the environmental problems were inequitably focused especially on regions where people with low social and economic status were concentrated.

The problems of environmental injustice have arisen by environment related organizations, but approaches to solve the problems were greatly supported by the government, which developed various policies and launched institution. These actions helped raise awareness of environmental justice in South Korea. Existing environment policies were modified to cover environmental justice issues.

Environmental justice began to be widely recognized in the 1990s through policy making and researches of related institutions. For example, the [[Ministry of Environment]], which was founded in 1992, launched Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) to raise awareness of the problem and figure out appropriate plans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/bgreen-activism-and-civil-society-south-korea-b]''Green Activism and Civil Society in South Korea (2002)'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of its activities, Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) held Environmental Justice forum in 1999, to gather and analyze the existing studies on the issue which were done sporadically by various organizations. Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) started as a small organization, but it is keep growing and expanding. In 2002, CMEJ had more than 5 times the numbers of members and 3 times the budget it had in the beginning year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150424040456/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2941&amp;context=etd]''Lee, Hosuk.(2009) Political Ecology of Environmental Justice : Environmental struggle &amp; Injustice in the Yeongheung island Coal Plant Controversy.

Environmental injustice is still an ongoing problem. One example is the construction of [[Saemangeum Seawall]]. The construction of Saemangeum Seawall, which is the world's longest dyke (33 kilometers) runs between [[Yellow Sea]] and [[Saemangeum]] estuary, was part of a government project initiated in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://earth.esa.int/web/earth-watching/historical-views/content/-/article/saemangeum-dam-south-korea]''Earth Watching : Saemangeum Dam'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The project raised concerns on the destruction of ecosystem and taking away the local residential regions. It caught the attention of environmental justice activists because the main victims were low-income fishing population and their future generations. This is considered as an example of environmental injustice which was caused by the execution of exclusive development-centered policy.

The construction of [[Seoul-Incheon canal]] also raised environmental justice controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/02/117_39362.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111063056/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/02/117_39362.html |archivedate=2016-01-11 |df= }}''The Korea Times : Seoul-Incheon Canal Construction Kicks Off (2009)'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction took away the residential regions and farming areas of the local residents. Also, the environment worsened in the area because of the appearance of wet fogs which was caused by water deprivation and local climate changes caused by the construction of canal. The local residents, mostly people with weak economic basis, were severely affected by the construction and became the main victims of such environmental damages. While the socially and economically weak citizens suffered from the environmental changes, most of the benefits went to the industries and conglomerates with political power.

Construction of [[Factory|industrial complex]] was also criticized in the context of environmental justice. The conflict in Wicheon region is one example. The region became the center of controversy when the government decided to build industrial complex of dye houses, which were formerly located in [[Daegu]] metropolitan region. As a result of the construction, [[Nakdong River]], which is one of the main rivers in South Korea, was contaminated and local residents suffered from environmental changes caused by the construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreascience.or.kr/search/articlepdf_ocean.jsp?url=http://ocean.kisti.re.kr/downfile/volume/kenss/KHGGB3/1996/v5n3/KHGGB3_1996_v5n3_297.pdf&amp;admNo=KHGGB3_1996_v5n3_297]''Koreascience : A Policy Study to Preserve the Water Quality through the Activation of Local Autonomy'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kfem.or.kr/wp-content/uploads/1997/08/data_envinfo_einter_179_casestudy-on-Environmental-Issue-in-Korea.doc&amp;prev=search]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''Choony, Kim.

Environmental justice is a growing issue in South Korea. Although the issue is not yet widely recognized compared to other countries, many organizations beginning to recognize the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yongin.eco.or.kr/main/main.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904005259/http://yongin.eco.or.kr/main/main.php |archivedate=2015-09-04 |df= }}''Yongin Environmental Justice website'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between Northern and Southern countries===

Environmental discrimination in a global perspective is also an important factor when examining the Environmental Justice movement. Even though the Environmental Justice movement began in the United States, the United States also contributes to expanding the amount of environmental injustice that takes place in less-developed countries.&lt;ref name="Clapp"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clapp |first=Jennifer |url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/dunnweb/rprnts.2005.10.10Clapp.pdf |title=Distance of Waste: Overconsumption in a Global Economy |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605171715/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/dunnweb/rprnts.2005.10.10Clapp.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies in the United States and in other developed nations around the world contribute to the injustice by shipping the toxic waste and byproducts of factories to less-developed countries for disposal. This act increases the amount of waste in the third world countries, most of which do not have proper sanitation for their own waste much less the waste of another country. Often, the people of the less-developed countries are exposed to toxins from this waste and do not even realize what kind of waste they are encountering or the health problems that could come with it.&lt;ref name="Pellow, 2007"&gt;[[David Naguib Pellow|Pellow, David Naguib]]. 2007. ''Resisting Global Toxics''. The MIT Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;

One prominent example of northern countries shipping their waste to southern countries took place in [[Haiti]]. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania had ash from the incineration of toxic waste that they did not have room to dump. Philadelphia decided to put the ash into the hands of a private company, which shipped the ash and dumped it in various other parts of the world, outside of the United States. ''[[Khian Sea waste disposal incident|The Khian Sea]]'', the ship the ash was put on, sailed around the world and many countries would not accept the waste because it was hazardous for the environment and the people. The ship owners finally dumped the waste, labeled Fertilizer, in Haiti, on the beach, and sailed away in the night. The government of Haiti was infuriated and called for the waste to be removed, but the company would not come to take the ash away. The fighting over who was responsible for the waste and who would remove the waste went on for many years. After debating for over ten years, the waste was removed and taken back to a site just outside Philadelphia to be disposed of permanently.&lt;ref name="Pellow, 2007"/&gt;

The reason that this transporting of waste from Northern countries to the Southern countries takes place is because it is cheaper to transport waste to another country and dump it there, than to pay to dump the waste in the producing country because the third world countries do not have the same strict industry regulations as the more developed countries. The countries that the waste is taken to are usually impoverished and the governments have little or no control over the happenings in the country or do not care about the people.&lt;ref name="Park, 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Transnational movement networks===

Many of the Environmental Justice Networks that began in the United States expanded their horizons to include many other countries and became Transnational Networks for Environmental Justice. These networks work to bring Environmental Justice to all parts of the world and protect all citizens of the world to reduce the environmental injustice happening all over the world. Listed below are some of the major Transnational Social Movement Organizations.&lt;ref name="Pellow, 2007"/&gt;

*Basel Action Network – works to end toxic waste dumping in poor undeveloped countries from the rich developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ban.org/ |title=Basel Action Network |publisher=BAN |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*GAIA (Global Anti-Incinerator Alliance) – works to find different ways to dispose of waste other than incineration. This company has people working in over 77 countries throughout the world.
*GR (Global Response) – works to educate activists and the upper working class how to protect human rights and the ecosystem.
*[[Greenpeace International]] – which was the first organization to become the global name of Environmental Justice. Greenpeace works to raise the global consciousness of transnational trade of toxic waste.
*Health Care without Harm – works to improve the public health by reducing the environmental impacts of the health care industry.&lt;ref&gt;https://noharm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
*International Campaign for Responsible Technology – works to promote corporate and government accountability with electronics and how the disposal of technology affect the environment.
*[[International POPs Elimination Network]] – works to reduce and eventually end the use of [[persistent organic pollutant]]s (POPs) which are harmful to the environment.
*PAN (Pesticide Action Network) – works to replace the use of hazardous pesticides with alternatives that are safe for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.panna.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5587">'''Medieval Islamic geography''' was based on [[Hellenistic geography]] and reached its apex with [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] in the 12th century.{{citationneeded|date=September 2018}}

==History==
After its beginnings in the 8th century based on Hellenistic geography,&lt;ref&gt;Gerald R. Tibbetts, ''The Beginnings of a Cartographic Tradition'', in: John Brian Harley, David Woodward: ''Cartography in the Traditional Islamic and South Asian Societies'', Chicago, 1992, pp. 90–107 (97-100), {{ISBN|0-226-31635-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic geography was patronized by the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]]s of [[Baghdad]]. Various Islamic scholars contributed to its development, and the most notable include [[Al-Khwārizmī]], [[Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi|Abū Zayd al-Balkhī]] (founder of the "Balkhi school"), and [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]]. 

Islamic cartographers inherited Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' and [[Geographia (Ptolemy)|''Geography'']] in the 9th century. These works stimulated an interest in geography (particularly gazetteers) but were not slavishly followed.{{sfn|Edson|Savage-Smith|2004|pp=61–63}}  Instead, Arabian and Persian cartography followed [[Al-Khwārizmī]] in adopting a rectangular projection, shifting Ptolemy's [[Prime Meridian]] several degrees eastward, and modifying many of Ptolemy's geographical coordinates.

Having received Greek writings directly and without Latin intermediation, Arabian and Persian geographers made no use of European-style [[T-O map]]s.{{sfn|Edson|Savage-Smith|2004|pp=61–63}} 

In the 11th century, the Karakhanid Turkic scholar [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] was the first to draw a unique Islamic [[world map]], &lt;ref&gt;Hermann A. Die älteste türkische Weltkarte (1076 η. Ch.) // Imago Mundi: Jahrbuch der Alten Kartographie. — Berlin, 1935. — Bd.l. — S. 21—28.&lt;/ref&gt; where he illuminated the cities and places of the [[Turkic peoples]] of [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[Inner Asia]]. He showed the lake [[Issyk-Kul]] (in nowadays [[Kyrgyzstan]]) as the center of the world.

[[File:Alps satellite in winter.jpg|thumb|right|The Alps seen from space]]
The [[Alps]] cover a large area. This article describes the [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] of the Alps as a whole and of subdivisions of the range, follows the course of the main chain of the Alps and discusses the lakes and glaciers found in the region.

[[Image:Alpenrelief 02.jpg|right|thumb|400px|DEM-based [[shaded relief]]/hypsometric image of the Alps with the borders of the countries.]]
The Alps form a large mountain range dominating [[Central Europe]], including parts of [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Austria]], [[Slovenia]], [[Germany]] and possibly [[Hungary]] (if one includes the [[Günser Gebirge]] or the [[Ödenburger Gebirge]] in the Alps). In some areas, such as the edge of the [[Po (river)|Po Basin]], the edge of the range is unambiguous, but where the Alps border on other mountainous or hilly regions, the border may be harder to place. These neighbouring ranges include the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], the [[Massif Central]], the [[Jura mountains|Jura]], the [[Black Forest]], the [[Bohemian Forest|Böhmerwald]], the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], and the mountains of the [[Balkan Peninsula]].

The boundary between the Apennines and the Alps is usually taken to be the [[Colle di Cadibona]], at 435&amp;nbsp;m above sea level, above [[Savona]] on the Italian coast.

The [[Rhône (river)|Rhône]] forms a clear boundary between the [[tectonic]]ally-formed Alps and the largely [[volcanism|volcanically]]-formed Massif Central. Moving upstream, the Rhône turns to the east near [[Lyon]], and passes to the south of the Jura range before reaching [[Lake Geneva]]. An area of flat ground reaches from there to [[Lake Neuchâtel]], continuing the border, with the Jura to the north-west and the Alps to the south east. From Lake Neuchâtel to its confluence with the [[Rhine (river)|Rhine]], the [[Aare (river)|Aare]] forms the border.

The Black Forest is separated from the Alps by the Rhine and [[Lake Constance]], but exact delimitation is difficult in southern Germany, where the land gently slopes up to meet the mountains (known in German as the ''Schwäbisch-Bayerisches Alpenvorland'', the "Swabian-Bavarian pre-Alps").

In Austria, the [[Danube]] runs to the north of the Alps, separating it from the majority of the [[Bohemian Forest|Böhmerwald]], although some small areas, such as the [[Dunkelsteiner Wald]] south of the [[Wachau]], belong geologically to the [[Bohemian Forest|Böhmerwald]] despite being south of the [[Danube]]. The [[Vienna Woods|Wienerwald]] near [[Vienna]] forms the north-eastern corner of the Alps, and here the Danube passes at its closest to the Alps (see [[Viennese Basin]]).

&lt;/ref&gt;

East of Vienna, only the [[Marchfeld]], a 30-km wide [[flood plain]] separates the easternmost Alps from the [[Lesser Carpathians]]. After Vienna, the [[Pannonian Basin]], a large area of [[steppe]], meets the edge of the Alps, clearly delimiting the eastern limit of the Alps. 

The south-easternmost extension of the Alps is to be found in [[Slovenia]], including [[Pohorje]], the [[Kamnik Alps]] and the [[Julian Alps]] (the last being shared with Italy). The town of [[Idrija]] may be taken as marking the dividing line between the Alps to the north and the [[Karst]] plateau to the south, which then leads on to the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula.&lt;ref name="alpsmap" /&gt; 

The remainder of the southern edge of the Alps is clearly delimited by the basin of the [[Po (river)|Po]].

This delimitation of the Alps is, however, largely subjective and open to argument. In particular, some people restrict the use of the term "Alps" to the higher mountains in the centre of the range, relegating the surrounding hills and mountains to the status of "pre-Alps" or [[foothill]]s. This can sometimes lead to conflicting definitions, such as [[Mont Ventoux]] being considered to lie outside the Alps (there are no comparably sized mountains around it, and it is at a considerable distance from the main chain of the Alps).

It is also not possible to define the Alps geologically, since the same [[orogeny|orogenous]] events that created the Alps also created neighbouring ranges such as the Carpathians. See also [[Geology of the Alps]]. The Alps are a distinct physiographic province of the larger Alpine System physiographic division, but the Alps are composed of three distinct physiographic sections, the Eastern, Western and Southern Alps physiographic sections.

==Subdivisions==
While smaller groups within the Alps may be easily defined by the passes on either side, defining larger units can be problematic. A traditional divide exists between the [[Western Alps]] and the [[Eastern Alps]], which uses the [[Splügen Pass]] ({{Lang-it|Passo dello Spluga}}) on the Swiss-Italian border, together with the [[Rhine]] to the north and [[Lake Como]] in the south as the defining features. While the Splügen Pass is neither the lowest nor the most important pass in the Alps, it is approximately halfway along the main chain, and makes a convenient boundary.

===Eastern Alps===
The [[Eastern Alps]] are commonly subdivided according to the different [[lithology]] (rock composition) of the more central parts of the Alps and the groups at its northern and southern fringes:
* [[Flysch|Flysch zone]] (up from the [[Vienna Woods]] to the [[Bregenz Forest]]). 
* [[Northern Limestone Alps]], peaks up to 3000 m;
* [[Central Eastern Alps]] (Austria, Swiss), peaks up to 4050 m;
* [[Southern Limestone Alps]], peaks up to 3500 m.
The border between the Central Eastern Alps and the Southern Limestone Alps is the [[Periadriatic Seam]]. The Northern Limestone Alps are separated from the Central Eastern Alps by the [[Greywacke zone|Grauwacken Zone]].

However, the geologic subdivision, based on [[tectonics]], suggests a different system:
* The ''[[Helvetic nappes|Helvetic]] system'' in the north (including the [[Jura mountains]], which do ''not'' geographically belong to the Alps),
* the ''[[Penninic nappes|Penninic]] system'': mainly Central Alps ([[Engadine window|Engadine]] and "[[Hohe Tauern window|Tauern window]]") and Flysch Alps,
* the ''[[Austroalpine nappes|Austroalpine]] system'': Northern [[Northern Limestone Alps|Limestone Alps]], Graywacke-[[Schist]] zone, Central [[basement (geology)|Crystalline]],
* the [[Southern Alps (geology)|Southern Alps]] (Southern Limestone Alps and other chains south of the Periadriatic Seam)
* south of a huge [[geologic fault]] ("alpine-dinaric seam") parts of the [[Dinarides]].

===Western Alps=== &lt;!-- Durance links here --&gt;
The [[Western Alps]] are commonly subdivided into the following:
*[[Ligurian Alps]] (from [[Savona]] to [[Colle di Tenda]])
*[[Maritime Alps]] (from Colle di Tenda to [[Colle della Maddalena]])
*[[Cottian Alps]] (from Colle de la Maddalena to [[Montgenevre Pass]])
*[[Dauphiné Alps]] (from Col du Mont Genevre to [[Col du Mont Cenis]])
*[[Graian Alps]] (from Col du Mont Cenis to the [[Col Ferret]])
*[[Chablais Alps]] (from [[Lake Geneva]] to the [[Col des Montets]])
*[[Pennine Alps]] (from Col Ferret to the [[Simplon Pass]])
*[[Lepontine Alps]] (from Simplon Pass to [[Splügen Pass]])
*[[Bernese Alps]] (north of the [[Rhône]] to the [[Grimsel Pass]])
*[[Urner Alps]] (from Grimsel Pass to the [[Reuss (river)|Reuss]])
*[[Glarus Alps]] (north-east of [[Oberalp Pass]])
*[[Appenzell Alps]] (north of [[Sargans]])

Within the Eastern Alps, the most widely used subdivision is the [[Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps|Alpine Club's 1984 classification]], which divides the region into about seventy small areas.

==Main chain==
{{Details|Main chain of the Alps}}
The "main chain of the Alps" follows the watershed from the Mediterranean to the [[Vienna Woods|Wienerwald]], passing over many of the highest and most famous peaks in the Alps. The most important passes and peaks which it crosses are given below (mountains are indented, passes unindented). From the Colle di Cadibona to [[Col de Tende]] it runs westwards, before turning to the north-west and then, near the Colle de la Maddalena, to the north. Upon reaching the Swiss border, the line of the main chain heads approximately east-north-east, a heading it follows until its end near [[Vienna]].

==Glaciers==
Several [[glacier]]s are located in the Alps, the longest of which is the [[Aletsch Glacier]] in the [[Bernese Alps]]. They may be found in all of the higher groups of mountains from the [[Dauphiné Alps]] in France to the [[Hohe Tauern]] in central Austria, and the main ascent routes on many of the highest mountains pass over glaciers.

==Lakes==
Very few large lakes are found within the body of the Alps, but a number are situated around the edge, particularly in areas formerly covered by glacier tongues. These include [[Lake Geneva]] on the northern side of the alps, on the French/Swiss border, [[Lago Maggiore]], [[Lake Como]] and [[Lake Garda]] on the southern side of the Alps in Italy, and the lakes of Switzerland, southern Germany and the Austrian [[Salzkammergut]] in the north.

==Rivers==
{{Main|Valleys of the Alps}}
{{Alps orography}}

The main [[drainage basin]]s of the Alps are those of the [[Rhine]], the [[Rhône (river)|Rhone]], the [[Danube]] and the [[Po (river)|Po]]. These have as main tributaries:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2880">The '''geology of [[Cuba]]''' differs significantly from that of other Caribbean islands because of ancient 900 million year old [[Precambrian]] [[Proterozoic]] metamorphic rocks in the Santa Clara province and extensive [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] outcrops. 

Western and central Cuba are a deformed orogen, that came about due to the collision of an island arc in the Cretaceous with the Florida-Bahamas platform. As a result, the Cuban [[ophiolite]] zone became obducted and a northward verging fold and thrust belt formed. A second small orogeny took place in the [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]]. Eastern Cuba, southeast of the Cauto Basin, by contrast has a [[Cenozoic]] volcanic arc complex, with ophiolites north and east of the Sierra Maestra as Mesozoic-age orogen rocks overlain by [[Paleogene]] sedimentary rocks and [[tuff]]. Sedimentation due to the tectonic activity continued into the [[Oligocene]].&lt;ref&gt;https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/43656582/Geological_development_of_Cuba20160312-1103-dbpu4q.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1541826073&amp;Signature=h%2BSI2AAF7NbWLVMyWlyULTGvKaA%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DGeological_development_of_Cuba.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-8535-6_13|title=The Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean|first=Georges|last=Pardo|date=10 November 1975|publisher=Springer US|pages=553–615|doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-8535-6_13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=xjIuAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=geology+of+cuba&amp;ots=PWCajfyIyF&amp;sig=aM31c_RkCqLysisk_sTDHM_if14#v=onepage&amp;q=geology+of+cuba&amp;f=false|title=Geology of Cuba: AAPG Studies in Geology 58|first=Georges|last=Pardo|date=20 April 2009|publisher=AAPG|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/handle/2445/122345|title=The geology of Cuba: A brief overview and synthesis|first1=Iturralde-Vinent,|last1=M.|first2=García-Casco,|last2=A.|first3=Rojas-Agramonte,|last3=Y.|first4=Proenza Fernández, Joaquín|last4=Antonio|first5=Murphy, J.|last5=B.|first6=Stern, R.|last6=J.|date=1 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''geology of Nepal''' is dominated by the [[Himalaya]], the highest, youngest and a very highly active mountain range.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=GEOLOGY OF THE NEPAL HIMALAYA AND ADJACENT REGION|last=Upreti|first=Bishal Nath|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=kathmandu,Nepal|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Himalaya is a type locality for the study of on-going continent-continent collision tectonics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Himalayan arc extends about 2400&amp;nbsp;km from [[Nanga Parbat]] (8,138&amp;nbsp;m) by the [[Indus River]] in northern [[Pakistan]] eastward to [[Namche Barwa]] (7,756&amp;nbsp;m) by the [[Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon|gorge]] of the [[Yarlung Zangbo River|Tsangpo]]-[[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] in eastern [[Tibet]] {{harv|Le Fort|1996}}. About 800&amp;nbsp;km of this extent is in [[Nepal]]; the remainder includes [[Bhutan]] and parts of [[Pakistan]], [[India]], and [[China]].

Since 55&amp;nbsp;[[mya (unit)|Ma]] the Himalayan [[orogeny]] beginning with the collision of [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Eurasia]] at the [[Paleocene]]/[[Eocene]] epoch {{harv|Rowley|1996}}, has thickened the Indian [[crust (geology)|crust]] to its present thickness of 70&amp;nbsp;km {{harv|Le Fort|1975}}. The northwest tip of India after colliding with Asia seems to have met along the full length of the [[Suture (geology)|suture]] by about 40&amp;nbsp;Ma {{harv|Dewey|Shackleton|Chengfa|Yiyin|1988}}.

Immediately prior to the onset of the Indo-Asian collision, the northern boundary of the Indian shield was likely a thinned [[continental margin]] on which [[Proterozoic]] [[Clastic rock|clastic]] sediments and the [[Cambrian]] ±[[Eocene]] [[Tethys Ocean|Tethyan]] shelf sequence were deposited {{harv|Le Fort|1996}}.

== Morpho-tectonic division of Nepal Himalaya ==

{{Harvnb|Heim|Gansser|1939}}, and {{Harvnb|Gansser|1964}} divided the rocks of the Himalaya into four [[Tectonostratigraphy|tectonostratigraphic]] zones that are characterised by distinctive [[stratigraphy]] and physiography. From south to north, it can be divided into five latitudinal morpho-tectonic zones and  these are :

1.The Gangatic Plain (Terai)

2. The Sub Himalayan (Chure or Siwalik)

3 Lesser Himalayan (Mahabharat Mountain Range),

4.Greater Himalayan, and

5.Tibetan Himalayan zones (Tethys Himalaya).

=== Gangetic plain ===

The gangetic plain is also called the [[Terai]] which is a rich, fertile and ancient land in the southern parts of Nepal. It represents Holocene/Recent sedimentation belt where fluvial sedimentation is still in progress. This plain is less than 200 m above sea level and has thick (about 1500 m) alluvial deposit. The alluvial deposits mainly consists of boulders, gravel, sand, silt and clay. It is a foreland basin which consists of the sediments brought down from the northern part of Nepal. It is the Nepalese extension of the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]s, which covers most of northern and eastern India, the most populous parts of Pakistan, and virtually all of Bangladesh. The Plains get their names from the rivers Ganges and Indus.

The vast [[alluvial plain]]s of the Indo-Gangetic Basin evolved as a [[foreland basin]] in the southern part of the rising Himalaya, before breaking up along a series of steep faults known as the Himalayan Frontal Fault {{Harv|Nakata|1989}} or the Main Frontal Thrust {{Harv|Gansser|1981}}. It comprises several sub-basins and all of them are quite shallow towards the south, but rather deep in the northern sections.

=== Sub-Himalaya (Siwaliks) ===
The Sub-Himalayan Sequence borders the Indo-Gangetic Floodplain along the Himalayan Frontal Fault and is dominated by thick Late Tertiary [[Molasse|mollassic]] deposits known as the Siwaliks that resulted from the accumulating [[fluvial]] deposits on the southern front of the evolving Himalaya. In Nepal, it extends throughout the country from east to west in the southern part. It is delineated by the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT) and Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) in south and north respectively. The youngest sediments on the top are the [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], and the [[sandstone]]s and [[mudstone]]s are dominant in the lower portions. The upward coarsening sequence of the sediments obviously exhibit the time-history in the evolution and growth of the Himalaya during the early [[Tertiary]] time {{Harv|Gansser|1964}}.

The Sub Himalayan zone is the 10 to 25&amp;nbsp;km wide belt of Neogene [[Siwalik]]s (or Churia) group rocks forming the topographic front of the Himalaya. It rises from the [[fluvial]] plains of the active foreland basin, and this front generally mapped as the trace of the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT). The Siwaliks Group consists of upward-coarsening successions of fluvial mudstone, [[siltstone]], sandstone, and conglomerate.

The Siwaliks Group in Nepal is composed of  three units that are known as lower, middle and upper members. These units can be correlated with the Sub Himalaya of Pakistan and of northern India {{Harv|Burbank|Beck|Mulder|1996}}. Palaeocurrent and [[Petrography|petrographic]] data from the sandstone and conglomerate indicate that these rocks were derived from the fold-thrust belt, and deposited within the flexural foredeep of the [[Himalayan foreland basin]] ({{Harvcolnb|Tokuoka|Takayasu|Yoshida|Hisatomi|1986}}; {{Harvcolnb|DeCelles|Gehrels|Quade|Ojha|1998}}).

=== Lesser Himalaya ===

The Lesser Himalayas lies in between the Sub-Himalayas and Higher Himalayas separated by the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) and the Main Central Thrust (MCT) respectively. The total width ranges from 60–80&amp;nbsp;km. The Lesser Himalayas is made up mostly of the unfossiliferous sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks; such as [[shale]], sandstone, conglomerate, [[slate]], [[phyllite]], [[schist]], [[quartzite]], [[limestone]] and [[dolomite]]. The rocks range in age from [[Precambrian]] to [[Miocene]]. The geology is complicated due to [[Fold (geology)|folding]], [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[Thrust fault|thrusting]] and are largely unfossiliferous. [[Tectonics|Tectonically]], the entire Lesser Himalayas consists of two sequences of rocks: [[allochthon]]ous, and [[Autochthon (geology)|autochthonous]]-paraautochthonous units; with various [[nappe]]s, [[klippe]]s and [[Window (geology)|tectonic windows]].

The northernmost boundary of the Siwaliks Group is marked by the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT), over which the low-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Lesser Himalaya overlie. The Lesser Himalaya, also called the Lower Himalaya, or the Midlands, is a thick (about 7&amp;nbsp;km) section of para-autochthonous crystalline rocks made up of low- to medium grade rocks. These lower [[Proterozoic]] clastic rocks {{Harv|Parrish|Hodges|1996}} are subdivided into two groups. Argillo-arenaceous rocks dominate the lower half of the succession, whereas the upper half consists of both [[Carbonate rock|carbonate]] and [[Siliciclastic|siliciclastic rock]]s ({{Harvtxt|Hagen|1969}}; {{Harvcolnb|Le Fort|1975}}; {{Harvcolnb|Stöcklin|1980}}).

The Lesser Himalaya thrust over the Siwaliks along the MBT to the south, and is overlained by the allochthonous thrust sheets of Kathmandu and HHC along the MCT. The Lesser Himalaya is folded into a vast post-metamorphic [[Anticline|anticlinal]] structure known as the Kunchha-Gorkha [[anticlinorium]] {{Harv|Pêcher|1977}}. The southern flank of the anticlinorium is weakly metamorphosed, whereas the northern flank is highly metamorphosed.

=== Main Central Thrust Zone ===

{{Harvnb|Heim|Gansser|1938}} defined the MCT in Kumaon based on the difference in [[metamorphic grade]] between low to medium-grade rocks of the Lesser Himalaya and higher-grade rocks of the Greater Himalaya. However, the fault originally defined by {{Harvnb|Heim|Gansser|1938}} is not the MCT, but a fault within Lesser Himalaya rocks ({{Harvcolnb|Valdiya|1980}}; {{Harvcolnb|Ahmad|Harris|Bickle|Chapman|2000}}). This misidentification symbolizes the challenge that workers have faced in locating the MCT. The metamorphic grade within the Lesser Himalaya increases towards the MCT and at higher structural levels.

In central Nepal, the metamorphic grade increases from low (chlorite + biotite) to medium (biotite + garnet + kyanite + staurolite) towards the MCT over a north-south distance. The highest-grade rocks (kyanite and sillimanite gneisses) are found within the MCT [[shear zone]], i.e. upper Lesser Himalaya. {{Harvtxt|Arita|1983}} places two thrusts (MCT I and MCT II) on each side of the MCT shear zone.

=== Higher Himalaya ===

This zone extends from the MCT to Tibetan-Tethys Zone and runs throughout the country. This zone consists of almost 10&amp;nbsp;km thick succession of the [[crystalline rock]]s,  commonly called the Himal Group. This sequence can be divided into four main units, as Kyanite-Sillimanite [[gneiss]], [[Pyroxene|pyroxenic]] [[marble]] and gneiss, banded gneiss, and [[augen gneiss]] in the ascending order {{Harv|Bordet|Colchen|LeFort|1972}}.

The Higher Himalayan sequence has been variously named. French workers used the term Dalle du Tibet (Tibetan Slab) for this unit ({{Harvcolnb|Le Fort|1975}}; {{Harvcolnb|Bordet|Colchen|LeFort|1972}}). {{Harvtxt|Hagen|1969}} called them Khumbu Nappes, and Lumbasumba Nappes. {{Harvtxt|Arita|1983}} calls it the Himalayan Gneiss Group, and it lies above the MCT II, or the upper MCT.

The High Himalayan Crystalline units (HHC) {{harv|Bollinger|Avouac|Beyssac|Catlos|2004}} are mainly composed of kyanite- to sillimanite-grade gneisses intruded by High Himalayan [[leucogranite]]s at structurally higher levels {{Harv|Upreti|1999}}. Throughout much of the range, the unit is divided into three formations {{Harv|Pêcher|Le Fort|1986}}. In central Nepal {{Harv|Guillot|1999}}, the upper Formation III consists of augen orthogneisses, whereas the Middle Formation II are calcsilicate gneisses and marbles, and the basal Formation I are kyanite- and sillimanite bearing [[Pelite|metapelite]]s, gneisses, and [[greywacke|metagreywacke]] with abundant [[quartzite]].

The gneiss of Higher Himalayan zone (HHZ) is a thick continuous sequence of about 5 to 15&amp;nbsp;km {{Harv|Guillot|1999}}. The northern part is marked by North Himalayan Normal fault (NHNF), which is also known as the South Tibetan Detachment system (STDS). At its base, it is bounded by the MCT. The [[protolith]] of the HHC is interpreted to be Late Proterozoic clastic sedimentary rocks deposited on the northern Indian margin {{Harv|Parrish|Hodges|1996}}.

=== Tibetan-Tethys ===

The Tibetan-Tethys Himalayas generally begins from the top of the Higher Himalayan Zone and extends to the north in [[Tibet]]. In Nepal these fossiliferous rocks are well developed in [[Thak Khola]] ([[Mustang District|Mustang]]), [[Manang]] and [[Dolpa]] area. This zone is about 40&amp;nbsp;km wide and composed of fossiliferous [[sedimentary rock]]s such as shale, [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]] etc.

The area north of the [[Annapurna]] and [[Manaslu]] ranges in central Nepal consists of metasediments that overlie the Higher Himalayan zone along the South Tibetan Detachment system. It has undergone very little metamorphism except at its base where it is close to the Higher Himalayan crystalline rocks. The thickness is currently presumed to be 7,400&amp;nbsp;m {{Harv|Fuchs|Widder|Tuladhar|1988}}. The rocks of the Tibetan Tethys Series (TSS) consist of a thick and nearly continuous lower Paleozoic to lower Tertiary marine sedimentary succession. The rocks are considered to be deposited in a part of the Indian [[passive continental margin]] {{Harv|Liu|Einsele|1994}}.

'''Highlands''' or '''uplands''' are any [[mountain]]ous region or elevated mountainous [[plateau]]. Generally speaking, upland (or uplands) refers to ranges of [[hill]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] (1995 and later), [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/glossary_U.html#upland upland], UCMP Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; typically up to 500–600&amp;nbsp;m. Highland (or highlands) is usually reserved for ranges of low [[mountain]]s.

==Highlands internationally==
Probably the most known highlands in the [[anglosphere]] are the [[Scottish Highlands]] in northern [[Scotland]], the mountainous region north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]]. The [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] [[council area]] is a [[local government (Scotland)|local government]] area in the Scottish Highlands and Britain's largest local government area.

Many countries have areas that are officially or unofficially referred to as ''highlands''. Other than [[Scotland]], these include parts of [[Tibet (1912–51)|Tibet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Visions in Tibetan Studies: Proceedings of the First International Seminar of Young Tibetologists|last=|first=|publisher=Serindia Publications, Inc.|year=2009|isbn=978-1-932476-45-3|editor-last=Dotson|editor-first=Brandon|edition=1st|location=Chicago|pages=189|chapter=The Tibetan Gesar Epic as Oral Literature|quote=... for the highlanders for eastern Tibet|editor-last2=Gurung|editor-first2=Kalsang Norbu|editor-last3=Halkias|editor-first3=Georgios|editor-last4=Myatt|editor-first4=Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethiopian Highlands|Ethiopia]], [[Canada]], [[White Highlands|Kenya]], [[Eritrean Highlands|Eritrea]], [[Yemen]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Syria]], and [[Cantabria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=Mars|last2=Cooper|first2=H.

Synonymous terms used in other countries include ''high country'', used in [[high country (New Zealand)|New Zealand]], [[Snowy Mountains|New South Wales]], [[Great Dividing Range|Victoria]], [[Central Highlands (Tasmania)|Tasmania]] and Southern Queensland in [[Australia]], and parts of the [[United States]] (notably [[Western North Carolina]]), [[highveld]], used in [[South Africa]] and ''[[Roof of the World]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/845721671|title=The hotel on the roof of the world : from Miss Tibet to Shangri-La|last=Alec|first=Le Sueur,|date=2003-01-01|publisher=RDR Books|isbn=1571431012|oclc=845721671}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for [[Tibet]].

The highlands in Australia are often above the elevation of 500 metres. These areas often receive snowfalls through winter.  Most of the highlands lead up to large alpine or sub-alpine mountainous regions such as the [[Australian Alps]], [[Snowy Mountains]], [[Great Dividing Range]], [[Northern Tablelands (New South Wales)|Northern Tablelands]] and [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. The most mountainous region of [[Tasmania]] is the [[Central Highlands (Tasmania)|Central Highlands]] area, which covers most of the central western parts of the state. Many of these areas are highly elevated alpine regions.

A spine of mountains runs the length of the island of [[New Guinea highlands|New Guinea]], forming a populous highlands region.

The [[Central Highlands of Sri Lanka]] these are rain forests, where the elevation reaches 2,500 metres (8,200 ft) above sea level.The [[Sri Lanka montane rain forests]] represent the montane and submontane moist forests above 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) in the central highlands and in the [[Knuckles mountain range]].Half of Sri Lanka's endemic flowering plants and 51 percent of the endemic vertebrates are restricted to this ecoregion. 

The [[highlands of Iceland]] cover about 40% of the country and are mostly inhospitable to humans. They are generally considered to be any land above 500 meters.

Additionally, the mountainous natural region of the [[Thai highlands]] is found in Northern Thailand.

The [[Cameron Highlands]] are a highland area and [[hill station]] in Northern Malaysia.

[[Shillong]] in [[India]] in the state of [[Meghalaya]] is a hill station which is surrounded by highlands. Officers of the [[British Raj]] referred to Shillong as "The Scotland of the East".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rao|first1=Sachin|title=Travel: Shillong, India - ‘Scotland of the east’|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/travel-shillong-india-scotland-of-the-east-1-3481504|accessdate=19 February 2017|work=www.scotsman.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other planets ==
'''Highland continents''' – or [[Planetary nomenclature#Terra|terrae]] – are areas of topographically unstable [[terrain]], with high peaks and valleys. They resemble highlands on [[Earth]], but the term is applied to much larger areas on other planets. They can be found on [[List of terrae on Venus|Venus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Highlands of Venus|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solar/venusland.html|website=HyperPhysics|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[List of terrae on Mars|Mars]] and [[List of Highlands on the Moon|the Moon]].

The '''''Història de la Marina Catalana''''' ('''''History of the Catalan Navy''''') is a book written by [[Arcadi Garcia Sanz]] that enumerates all aspects of the [[Catalan Navy]] in the [[trade]] and in the [[war]], its exploits and conquests, a historic collection ranging from prehistoric times to the present day. Describes the sea battles, the activities of the seamen, to end detailing aspects of [[maritime law]].&lt;ref name="Sanz1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arcadi García i Sanz|title=Història de la Marina Catalana |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUgSAAAAYAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Ed. Aedos|isbn=978-84-7003-161-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hont''' (-[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and German, in [[Latin]]: ''Honthum'', in Hungarian also: ''Honth'') was an administrative county ([[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|comitatus]]) of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and then shortly of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Its territory is now in southern [[Slovakia]] (3/4) and northern [[Hungary]] (1/4). 

Today, in Slovakia Hont is the informal designation of the corresponding territory and an official tourist region.

==Geography==
[[Image:Hont county map.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Map of the Hont county]]
[[Image:Gros Honter County Josephinische Landesaufnahme, 1782-85.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Map of the Hont county, 1782–1785]] 
Hont county shared borders with the counties [[Bars county|Bars]], [[Zólyom county|Zólyom]], [[Nógrád County (former)|Nógrád]], [[Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun]] and [[Esztergom County|Esztergom]]. It was situated between [[Banská Štiavnica|Selmecbánya]] and the [[Danube]] river, but the territory around the town of [[Krupina|Korpona]] was added only at the end of the 19th century. The rivers Korpona and [[Ipeľ|Ipoly]] were the central rivers that flowed through the county. Its area was 2633&amp;nbsp;km² around 1910.

==Capitals==
The capitals of the county were the [[Hont Castle]] together with Hídvég (present-day [[Ipeľské Predmostie]]), then from the 16th century onwards there was no permanent capital, and finally since early 19th century, the capital was Ipolyság (present-day [[Šahy]]).

==History==
The county arose in the 11th century by separation from the [[Nógrád (county)|Nógrád]] county. Around the year 1300, the territory of [[Gemer|Kishont]] was added to the territory of the county, but received a special status. In 1802, Kishont became part of the [[Gömör-Kishont]] county.

From 1552 to 1685, most of the county was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and belonged to the administrative unit called Nógrád [[sandjak]].

Changes to the northern border of the county were performed in 1802 and then in the late 19th century (above all [[Krupina|Korpona]] was added to the territory).

In the aftermath of [[World War I]], most of Hont county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia, as recognized by the concerned states in 1920 by the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. A small part of the county situated south-east of the river Ipoly/[[Ipeľ]], stayed in Hungary. 

In Czechoslovakia, the county continued to exist as the Hont county (''Hontianska župa''). In 1923, it became part of the [[Zvolen county]]. In 1928, it became part of the newly created Slovak Land (''Slovenská krajina/zem''). Following the provisions of the [[First Vienna Award]], the southern part of Czechoslovak Hont became part of Hungary again in November 1938. The remaining northern part became part of the newly created Hron county (1940–1945) of Slovakia. After World War II, the Trianon borders were restored. In 1949, it became part of the newly created Nitra region and Banská Bystrica region of Czechoslovakia. In 1960, it became part of the newly created [[Western Slovak region]] and [[Central Slovak region]]. In 1993, Czechoslovakia was split and in 1996 Hont became part of the newly created [[Nitra region]] and [[Banská Bystrica region]] of Slovakia.

The Hungarian part of Hont merged with the Hungarian part of [[Nógrád (county)|Nógrád]] county to form [[Nógrád-Hont]] county. Between 1939 and 1945 it was united with the annexed parts of former [[Bars county|Bars]] and Hont counties to form [[Bars-Hont]] county (capital [[Levice|Léva]]). Since 1950 the Hungarian part of Hont is divided between the present Hungarian counties [[Pest (county)|Pest]] and [[Nógrád (county)|Nógrád]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7592">The '''Kingdom of Orungu''' (c. 1700–1927) ({{lang-pt|Reino da Orungu}}, {{lang-fr|Royaume d'Orungu}}) was a small, pre-colonial state of what is now [[Gabon]] in [[Central Africa]]. Through its control of the slave trade in the 18th and 19th centuries, it was able to become the most powerful of the trading centers that developed in Gabon during that period.

==Origins==
The Kingdom of Orungu is named for its founders, the [[Orungu people|Orungu]], a [[Myènè language|Myènè]] speaking people of unknown origin. Most scholars believe they migrated into the [[Ogooué River]] delta in the early 17th century from the south.&lt;ref name="Gates, page 1468"&gt;Gates, page 1468&lt;/ref&gt; This is further backed up by the fact that the Orungu seemed to have been heavily influenced by the [[Kingdom of Loango]] or at very least its [[BaVili]] traders.&lt;ref name="Gray, page 28"&gt;Gray, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of migration, the Orungu drove another Myènè speaking people, the [[Mpongwe]], toward the Gabon Estuary in an effort to dominate trade with Europeans. The scheme was successful, and a prosperous kingdom emerged at [[Cape Lopez]].&lt;ref name="Gates, page 1468"/&gt;

==Government==
The Orungu Kingdom was made up of some 20 [[clan]]s. One of these clans held the line to succession as king, while the others exercised control over maritime commerce coming from the interior.&lt;ref name="Gates, page 1468"/&gt; The kingdom was unique in an area where the basic political unit was a clan ruling a village via a kind of collective leadership. The Orungu cast this aside for a single monarch, which their tradition maintains was descended from a legendary figure called the Mani Pongo&lt;ref&gt;Yates, page 88&lt;/ref&gt; The titles of the kingdom's political offices were adopted from the kingdom of Loango as well as a sense of clan hierarchy. These institutions likely moved with the Orungu from the Chilongo district in Loango.&lt;ref name="Gray, page 28"/&gt; The king's title, ''Agamwinboni'', seems to have its origin among the Orungu themselves and does not borrow from the "mani" prefix attached to kingdoms like Loango and [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]].

==Economy==
The kingdom of Orungu developed a broker culture thanks to their position on the coast. In the 17th century, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] dominated the coastal trade and [[ivory trade|ivory]] was the major export.&lt;ref name="Isichei, page 406"&gt;Isichei, page 406&lt;/ref&gt; The Orungu were a metal-working and boatbuilding culture, which allowed them to dominate the riverine trade. Maritime commerce was divided among the non-royal clans and included trades in Ivory, beeswax, dyewood, copal and ebony.&lt;ref name="Gates, page 1468"/&gt; By the start of the 19th century, the tiny but wealthy kingdom was able to import slaves from the interior.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
The Gabon coast, like that of [[Cameroon]], played only a minor role in the [[Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade]] compared with the [[Niger Delta]], the Loango coast or the coast of [[Angola]]. The export of slaves only became significant in the last 3rd of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Isichei, page 406"/&gt; At the start, the kingdom was a purchaser rather than seller of slaves, which they bought with ivory. Other than slave imports, the kingdom of Orungu also imported iron.&lt;ref name="Isichei, page 406"/&gt; By the 1760s, the Orungu were trading in slaves through which the agamwinboni was able to grow rich via taxation on the [[Nazareth River]] and [[San Mexias River]].&lt;ref name="Gates, page 1468"/&gt; Still, the trade in Orungu territory paled in comparison with its southern neighbor. In 1788, Cape Lopez and the Gabon estuary were exporting around 5,000 slaves per year in contrast to the 13,500 per year exported from Loango's coast.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 19th century, the Fernan Vaz Lagoon south of Cape Lopez supplied large numbers of slaves to the Orungu Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, page 32&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 19th century, most prominent coastal groups such as the Mpongwe were not selling their own people. The Orungu, however, often sold debtors, sorcerers, adulterers and cheats to the Portuguese slavers.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, the Orungu monarchy under King Ombango-Rogombe agreed to abandon the slave trade. In fact, they simply moved the trade upriver and tried to continue the trade secretly.&lt;ref name="Gates, page 1468"/&gt; The trade lasted until the 1870s as illicit slavers sent people from further up the river to [[Portugal|Portuguese]] buyers on the coast.&lt;ref name="Isichei, page 406"/&gt;

==Culture==
Despite their reputation as the most prominent slave traders in the region, some visitors to the kingdom left favorable reviews of the region and its people. John Newton visited the area in 1743 and remarked that they seemed "the most humane and moral people I ever met with in Africa; and they were the people who had the least intercourse with Europe at that time".&lt;ref name="Isichei, page 406"/&gt; This must not have remain true for very long. As time passed, the Orungu took on European dress and customs.&lt;ref name="Isichei, page 406"/&gt; However, the Orungu people held strongly to their traditional beliefs and were hostile to European missionaries. As a result, few gained western educations thus limiting their influence in colonial administration or post-colonial politics of Gabon. Today the Orungu are one of Gabon's smaller ethnic groups numbering around 10,000 people.&lt;ref name="Gates, page 1468"/&gt;

==Decline==
The fall of the Orungu Kingdom was directly tied to the fall of the slave trade. The king had become dependent on it and was unable to maintain the custom of [[patronage|royal patronage]] without it. This caused the kingdom to disintegrate and in 1873, [[King Ntchengué]] signed a treaty granting the French a post on Orungu territory.&lt;ref name="Gates, page 1468"/&gt; In 1927, the French had colonized the remnants of the kingdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9510">'''Land footprint''' is the real amount of [[land]], wherever it is in the world, that is needed to produce a product, or used by an organisation or by a nation.&lt;ref name="europa1"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/enveco/resource_efficiency/pdf/FootRev_Report.pdf Giljum, S., Lutter, S., Bruckner, M., Aparcana, S., Heinke, J., Gerten, D. et al. (2013, May 3). State-of-Play of National Consumption-Based Indicators: A review and evaluation of available methods and data to calculate footprint-type (consumption-based) indicators for materials, water, land and carbon.] Vienna: Sustainable Europe Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

Land footprint is a [[resource consumption|consumption]]-based indicator, i.e. it looks at the [[natural resources|resources]] needed to create a final product, or by an organisation or country, wherever they are in the world. This is in contrast to production-based indicators, which just look at resource use within a country.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} For example, cows will require land to graze on within a country, but may also be fed by feed grown on land in another country. This production vs consumption approach is extensively discussed in [[greenhouse gas emissions accounting]], where [[carbon footprint]] is the consumption-based indicator.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== Related concepts ==

Land footprint is closely linked to a number of other concepts, including:

* ''Ghost acres'' (or ghost hectares), a term that started to be in use in the 1960s, for example by Georg Borgström in his book "The Hungry Planet: The modern world at the edge of Famine" in 1965, refers to the area of land abroad that is used to grow feed for animals within a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GI8wAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=the+hungry+planet%3A+the+modern+world+at+the+edge+of+famine&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=ghost |title=The hungry planet: the modern world at the edge of famine - Georg Borgström - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Embedded land'' or "Virtual land", is the land that is effectively embedded in an imported product; i.e. the land used to produce the product (including any [[supply chain]], such as [[soybean|soya]] feed for [[meat production|beef]]).
* ''Global cropland'', as used in the [[International Resource Panel]] report on global [[land use]], is part of the total land footprint, but doesn't include e.g. [[Built-up area|built-up land]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/AreasofAssessment/AssessingGlobalLandUseBalancingConsumptionw/tabid/132063/Default.aspx International Resource Panel. (2014). Assessing global land use: Balancing consumption with sustainable supply.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels|Indirect land use change]]'', used in the debate on [[biofuels]], is a related concept, that looks at the land needed to grow biofuels, then considers the indirect impacts that this use of land may have on other land use in the country concerned.

[[Ecological footprint]] is measured using a different approach, with two key differences to land footprint:

* Ecological footprint adds together both real land use and an calculated (but not really existing) area of forest to absorb CO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; emissions, to incorporate part of the impacts of climate change. In contrast, land footprint looks only at real land use, and is often used in association with [[carbon footprint]] to cover all climate changing emissions.
* Ecological footprint adjusts land areas to [[global hectares]], while land footprint is based on real land area - or an estimate of it.

==Research==
The International Resource Panel has produced a detailed report on land, "Assessing global land use: Balancing consumption with sustainable supply",&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; which establishes a [[planetary boundary]] for cropland, and proposes a potential safe operating space target of 0.2 ha of cropland per person per year. This is in contrast to the current EU use of cropland of around 0.31 ha per person per year.

The most detailed study of Europe's land footprint (including forestry) and how this is traded with the rest of the work was published by Sustainable European Research Institute (SERI) in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Europe Research Institute. (2011). Europe’s global land demand: A study on the actual land embodied in European imports and exports of agriculture and forestry products. http://seri.at/en/global-responsibility/2011/10/19/europes-global-land-demand-a-study-on-the-actual-land-embodied-in-european-imports-and-exports-of-agricultural-and-forestry-products/&lt;/ref&gt; A briefing on this study is available from [[Friends of the Earth Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/publications/FoEE_Briefing_Europe_Global_Land_Demand_1011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531011838/http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/publications/FoEE_Briefing_Europe_Global_Land_Demand_1011.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of Germany's land balance&lt;ref&gt;Meier, T., Christen, O., Semler, E., Jahreis, G., Voget-Kleschin, L., Schrode, A. et al. (2013). Balancing virtual land imports by a shift in the diet. Using a land balance approach to assess the sustainability of food consumption. Germany as an example. Appetite, 74C, 20-34.&lt;/ref&gt; modelled the impact of changes in diet and consumption of stimulants (e.g. coffee, wine etc.) on Germany's land balance. It found that a switch to a healthier diet, with less meat and with reduced stimulants, could lead to no net land imports, while a switch to vegetarian or vegan diets would lead to Germany being a net exporter of land.

Sustainable Europe Research Institute have also examined potential scenarios for reducing Europe's land footprint, including dietary changes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/seri_land_footprint_scenario_nov2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:"To set a framework for action to improve resource efficiency aspects beyond GHG emissions and energy, targets for reducing the overall lifecycle environmental impact of consumption will be set.. Indicators and targets for land, water, material and carbon footprints as well as their role within the European Semester should also be considered in this regard."

The European Parliament's own initiative report on "Resource efficiency: moving towards a circular economy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=European Parliament|title=European Parliament resolution of 9 July 2015 on resource efficiency: moving towards a circular economy|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P8-TA-2015-0266&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN|accessdate=29 July 2015|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was voted on 9 July 2015, includes the following text calling for action from the European Commission on land and other footprints:
:"Urges the Commission to propose, by the end of 2015, a lead indicator and a dashboard of sub-indicators on resource efficiency, including ecosystem services; points out that the use of these harmonised indicators should be legally binding as of 2018, and they should measure [[resource consumption]], including imports and exports, at EU, Member State and industry level and take account of the whole lifecycle of products and services and should be based on the footprint methodology, measuring at least land, water and material use and carbon;"

A study of the four resource footprint indicators, carried for the European Commission&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt; examined what data was available to measure the land footprint, carbon footprint, water footprint &amp; material footprint at economy level. This study concluded that Land Footprint needed methodological improvement and harmonisation, and that a common, international, multi-regional input output database would make it easier to calculate all four footprints.

[[Friends of the Earth Europe]], together with a wider Land Footprint Coalition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foeeurope.org/Groups-unite-Europe-cut-use-world-land-180313 |title=Groups unite to call for Europe to cut its use of world’s land &amp;#124; Friends of the Earth Europe |publisher=Foeeurope.org |date=2013-03-18 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been advocating for Land Footprint to be used to measure resource consumption, as part of a wider project that argues that four footprints - land, [[Water footprint|water]], [[Carbon footprint|carbon]] &amp; material (equivalent to either RMC or TMC, see [[Material Flow Accounting]]) - are an effective way of measuring &amp; managing Europe's resource use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/publications/FoEE_SERI_measuring_europes_resource_use_0609.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition, which includes [[Slow Food|Slow Food Europe]] and [[Birdlife]], are also calling for Europe to reduce its land footprint.

The '''Land of Israel''' ({{Hebrew Name|אֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל|Eretz Yisrael|ʼÉreṣ Yiśrāʼēl}}) is the traditional Jewish name for an area of indefinite geographical extension in the [[Southern Levant]]. Related biblical, religious and historical English terms include the [[Land of Canaan]], the [[Promised Land]], the [[Holy Land]], and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (see also [[Israel (disambiguation)]]). The definitions of the limits of this territory vary between passages in the [[Hebrew Bible]], with specific mentions in Genesis 15, Exodus 23, Numbers 34 and Ezekiel 47. Nine times elsewhere in the Bible, the settled land is referred as "[[from Dan to Beersheba]], and three times it is referred as "from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt” (1 Kings 8:65, 1 Chronicles 13:5 and 2 Chronicles 7:8).

These biblical limits for the land differ from the borders of established historical Israelite and later Jewish kingdoms; over time these have included the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Kingdom of Israel]], the two separated kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel (Samaria)]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], the [[Hasmonean Kingdom]], and the [[Herodian Kingdom]], which at their heights ruled lands with similar but not identical boundaries. 

The Jewish religious belief defining the land as where Jewish religious law prevailed and excluding territory where it was not applied,&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Havelock, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5tCIiwLQr2MC&amp;pg=PA210 ''River Jordan: The Mythology of a Dividing Line,''] University of Chicago Press, 2011 p.210.&lt;/ref&gt; holds that the area is a God-given inheritance of the Jewish people based on the [[Torah]], particularly the books of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], as well as on the later [[Nevi'im|Prophets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/exodus/6-4.htm |title=Exodus 6:4 I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they resided as foreigners |publisher=Bible.cc |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Book of Genesis, the land was first promised by [[God in Judaism|God]] to the descendants of [[Abram]]; the text is explicit that this is a [[biblical covenants|covenant]] between God and Abram for his descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2015:18%E2%80%9321;&amp;version=NIV; |title=Gen 15:18–21; NIV; - On that day the LORD made a covenant |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abram's name was later changed to Abraham, with the promise refined to pass through his son [[Isaac]] and to the [[Israelites]], descendants of [[Jacob]], Abraham's grandson. This belief is not shared by most adherents of replacement theology (or [[supersessionism]]), who hold the view that the Old Testament prophecies were superseded by the coming of Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Vlach, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OWfRv-GoS4cC&amp;pg=PA4 ''Has the Church Replaced Israel?: A Theological Evaluation,''] B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2010 pp.3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; a view often repudiated by [[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionists]] as a theological error.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Spector,[https://books.google.com/books?id=g032JSwK8DwC&amp;pg=PA21 ''Evangelicals and Israel: The Story of American Christian Zionism,''] Oxford University Press, 2009 p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelical Zionists variously claim that Israel has title to the land by divine right,&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Wagner, Walter T. Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tt-jBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161 ''Zionism and the Quest for Justice in the Holy Land,''] The Lutterworth Press, 2014 p.161.&lt;/ref&gt; or by a theological, historical and moral grounding of attachment to the land unique to Jews ([[James Parkes (clergyman)|James Parkes]]),&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Kenny, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qh0gius48LcC&amp;pg=PA75 ''Catholics, Jews, and the State of Israel,''] Paulist Press, 1993 pp.75-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that ancient religious texts can be warrant or divine right for a modern claim has often been challenged,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Prior, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I4WtAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171 ''The Bible and Colonialism: A Moral Critique,''] A&amp;C Black 1997 p.171: ‘As an agent of legitimacy in international law, the Zionist appeal to Tanakh for legitimation of its claims to Eretz Israel is not much more compelling than if the Portuguese and Spanish Governments today presented to the UN the bulls off Nicholas V and Alexander VI, which also claimed divine authority, in their bid to reclaim the lands of the New World. p.171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Bickerton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jf5GAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 ''The Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Guide for the Perplexed,''] A&amp;C Black, 2012 p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; and Israeli courts have rejected land claims based on religious motivations.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Cotran, [[Chibli Mallat]], David Stott, (eds.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_A1nBdICyOgC&amp;pg=PA12 ''The Arab-Israeli Accords: Legal Perspectives,''] BRILL, 1996 pp.11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|League of Nations mandatory period (1920-1948]]) the term "Eretz Yisrael" or the "Land of Israel" was part of the official Hebrew name of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. Official Hebrew documents used the Hebrew transliteration of the word “Palestine” פלשתינה (Palestina) followed always by the two initial letters of "Eretz Yisrael", א״י Aleph-Yod.&lt;ref&gt;The Holy Land in History and Thought: Papers Submitted to the International conference edited by Moše Šārôn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israel Cohen, A Short History of Zionism, p.96, London, Frederick Muller Co., 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

The Land of Israel concept has been [[Declaration of Independence of Israel|evoked by the founders of the State of Israel]]. It often surfaces in political debates on the status of the [[West Bank]], which is referred to in official Israeli discourse as the [[Judea and Samaria Area]], from the names of the two [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|historical Jewish kingdoms]].&lt;ref name="Judea and Samaria"&gt;{{Cite book
| title= International Law and the Administration of Occupied Territories: Two Decades of Israeli Occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip| author=Emma Playfair| year= 1992| publisher=Oxford University Press| page = 41| quote= On 17 December 1967, the Israeli military government issued an order stating that "the term 'Judea and Samaria region' shall be identical in meaning for all purposes . .to the term 'the West Bank Region'". This change in terminology, which has been followed in Israeli official statements since that time, reflected a historic attachment to these areas and rejection of a name that was seen as implying Jordanian sovereignty over them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and biblical roots ==
[[File:Fertile Crescent concept 1916.png|thumb|350px|right|1916 map of the Fertile Crescent by [[James Henry Breasted]]. The names used for the land are "Canaan" "Judah" "Palestine" and "Israel"]]
[[File:1695 Eretz Israel map in Amsterdam Haggada by Abraham Bar-Jacob.jpg|thumb|Map of Eretz Israel in 1695 Amsterdam [[Haggada]] by [[Abraham Bar-Jacob]].]]

The term "Land of Israel" is a direct translation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] phrase {{Hebrew|ארץ ישראל}} (''Eretz Yisrael''), which occasionally occurs in the [[Bible]],{{sfn|Masalha|2007|p=32}} and is first mentioned in the [[Tanakh]] in {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|13:19|NIV}}, following [[the Exodus]], when the Israelite tribes were already in the Land of [[Canaan]].&lt;ref&gt;Keith W. Whitelam, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sHYeAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43 ''The Invention of Ancient Israel: The Silencing of Palestinian History,''] (1996) Routledge 2013, page 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The words are used sparsely in the Bible: King [[David]] is ordered to gather 'strangers to the land of Israel'(''hag-gêrîm ’ăšer, bə’ereṣ yiśrā’êl'') for building purposes ({{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|22:2|NIV}}), and the same phrasing is used in reference to [[King Solomon]]'s census of all of the 'strangers in the Land of Israel' ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|2:17|NIV}}). [[Ezekiel]], though generally preferring the phrase 'soil of Israel' (''’admat yiśrā’êl''), employs ''eretz israel'' twice, respectively at {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|40:2|NIV}} and {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|47:18|NIV}}.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Blenkinsopp, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Cneqfa8VJ0C&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ezekiel, Westminster John Knox Press, 1990], p.152: Quote: "It may be surprising to learn that the designation “the land of Israel” (''’ereṣ yiśrā’êl''), in common use today, occurs for the first time in Ezekiel (40:2; 47:18) and very rarely elsewhere (I Chron. 22:2; II Chron. 2:17), apart from the more restrictive allusion to the Northern Kingdom. By preference, however, Ezekiel speaks of the "soil of Israel" (''’admat yiśrā’êl''), a phrase that occurs eighteen times in the book and nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible. (The title “holy land," literally “holy soil”, used preferentially by Christians, occurs only once, at Zech. 2:12.)"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martin Noth]], the term is not an "authentic and original name for this land", but instead serves as "a somewhat flexible description of the area which the Israelite tribes had their settlements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The history of Israel|authorlink=Martin Noth|first=Martin|last=Noth|publisher=Harper|date=1960|quote=An authentic and original name for this land as a whole has not come down to us from Old Testament times, and presumably no such ever existed; since as a natural phenomenon it was never a homogeneous, self-contained entity and was never occupied by a homogeneous population, and it was hardly at any time the scene of a political organisation which substantially coincided with its actual area. So the expression 'the land of Israel' may serve as a somewhat flexible description of the area which the Israelite tribes had their settlements.|page=8|chapter=The Land of Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkiCAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Anita Shapira]], the term "Eretz Yisrael" was a holy term, vague as far as the exact boundaries of the territories are concerned but clearly defining ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Shapira, 1992, ''Land and Power'', {{ISBN|0-19-506104-7}}, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; The sanctity of the land (''kedushat ha-aretz'') developed rich associations in rabbinical thought,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Shavit Artson, 'Our Covenant with Stones: A Jewish Ecology of Earth,' in ''Judaism and Envirobnmental Ehics: A Reader,''Lexington Books, 2001 pp.161-171,p.162&lt;/ref&gt; where it assumes a highly symbolic and mythological status infused with promise, though always connected to a geographical location.&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Satlow, ''Creating Judaism: History, Tradition, Practice,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=RI55SN3GWLQC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.160], Columbia University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nur Masalha]] argues that the biblical boundaries are "entirely fictitious", and bore simply religious connotations in Diaspora Judaism, with the term only coming into ascendency with the rise of [[Zionism]].{{sfn|Masalha|2007|p=32}}

The Hebrew Bible provides three specific sets of borders for the "[[Promised Land]]", each with a different purpose. Neither of the terms "Promised Land" (Ha'Aretz HaMuvtahat) or "Land of Israel" are used in these passages: {{bibleverse||Genesis|15:13–21|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Genesis|17:8|NIV}}{{sfn|Sand|2012|p=27}} and {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|47:13–20|NIV}} use the term "the land" (ha'aretz), as does {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|1:8|NIV}} in which it is promised explicitly to "Abraham, Isaac and Jacob... and to their descendants after them," whilst {{bibleverse||Numbers|34:1–15|NIV}} describes the "Land of Canaan" (Eretz Kna'an) which is allocated to nine and half of the twelve [[Israelites|Israelite tribes]] after [[the Exodus]]. The expression "Land of Israel" is first used in a later book, {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|13:19|NIV}}. It is defined in detail in the exilic [[Book of Ezekiel]] as a land where both the twelve tribes and the "strangers in (their) midst", can claim inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Havrelock, ''River Jordan: The Mythology of a Dividing Line,''University of Chicago Press, 2011, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Israel" first appears in the Hebrew Bible as the name given by God to the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarch]] [[Jacob]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|32:28|NIV}}). Deriving from the name "Israel", other designations that came to be associated with the Jewish people have included the "[[Children of Israel]]" or "Israelite".

The term 'Land of Israel' (γῆ Ἰσραήλ) occurs in one episode in the [[New Testament]] ([[Matthew 2:20–21]]), where, according to [[Shlomo Sand]], it bears the unusual sense of 'the area surrounding Jerusalem'.{{sfn|Sand|2012|p=27}} The section in which it appears was written as a parallel to the earlier [[Book of Exodus]].{{Sfn|Goldberg|2001|p=147|ps=: The parallels between this narrative and that of Exodus continue to be drawn. Like Pharaoh before him, Herod, having been frustrated in his original efforts, now seeks to achieve his objectives by implementing a program of infanticide. As a result, here - as in Exodus - rescuing the hero’s life from the clutches of the evil king necessitates a sudden flight to another country. And finally, in perhaps the most vivid parallel of all, the present narrative uses virtually the same words of the earlier one to provide the information that the coast is clear for the herds safe return: here, in Matthew 2:20, "go [back]… for those who sought the Child's life are dead"; there, in Exodus 4:19, "go back… for all the men who sought your life are dead."}}

===Genesis 15===
{{bibleverse||Genesis|15:18–21|NIV}} describes what are known as "Borders of the Land" (''Gevulot Ha-aretz''),&lt;ref&gt;''Kol Torah'', vol. 13, no. 9, Torah Academy of Bergen County, 8 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which in Jewish tradition defines the extent of the [[Promised Land|land promised]] to the descendants of Abraham, through his son Isaac and grandson Jacob.&lt;ref name="chabad"&gt;See 6th and 7th portion commentaries by [http://www.chabad.org/parshah/rashi/default_cdo/aid/9169/jewish/Lech-Lecha.htm Rashi]&lt;/ref&gt; The passage describes the area as the land of the ten named ancient peoples then living there.

More precise geographical borders are given {{bibleverse||Exodus|23:31|NIV}} which describes borders as marked by the Red Sea (see debate below), the "Sea of the Philistines" ''i.e.'', the [[Mediterranean]], and the "River", the [[Euphrates]]), the traditional furthest extent of the Kingdom of [[David]].&lt;ref name="Stuart, Douglas K. 2006, p. 549"&gt;Stuart, Douglas K., ''Exodus'', B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2006, p. 549&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TyndaleBible"&gt;''Tyndale Bible Dictionary'', Walter A. Elwell, Philip Wesley Comfort, Tyndale House Publishers, Inc., 2001, p. 984&lt;/ref&gt;

Genesis gives the border with Egypt as ''Nahar Mitzrayim'' – ''nahar'' in Hebrew denotes a large river, never a wadi.

===Exodus 23===
A slightly more detailed definition is given in {{bibleverse||Exodus|23:31|NIV}}, which describes the borders as "from the sea of reeds (Red Sea) to the Sea of the Philistines (Mediterranean sea) and from the desert to the [[Euphrates]] River", though the Hebrew text of the Bible uses the name, "the River", to refer to the Euphrates.

Only the "Red Sea" (Exodus 23:31) and the [[Euphrates]] are mentioned to define the southern and eastern borders of the full land promised to the Israelites. The "Red Sea" corresponding to Hebrew ''Yam Suf'' was understood in ancient times to be the [[Erythraean Sea]], as reflected in the [[Septuagint]] translation. Although the English name "Red Sea" is derived from this name ("Erythraean" derives from the Greek for red), the term denoted all the waters surrounding Arabia—including the Indian Ocean and the [[Persian Gulf]], not merely the sea lying to the west of Arabia bearing this name in modern English. Thus, the entire Arabian peninsula lies within the borders described. Modern maps depicting the region take a reticent view and often leave the southern and eastern borders vaguely defined. The borders of the land to be conquered given in Numbers have a precisely defined eastern border which included the Arabah and Jordan.

===Numbers 34===
{{Main article|Tribal allotments of Israel}}

{{bibleverse||Numbers|34:1–15|NIV}} describes the land allocated to the Israelite tribes after the Exodus. The tribes of [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]] and half of [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] received land [[Transjordan (Bible)|east]] of the [[Jordan River|Jordan]] as explained in {{bibleverse||Numbers|34:14–15|NIV}}. {{bibleverse||Numbers|34:1–13|NIV}} provides a detailed description of the borders of the land to be conquered west of the Jordan for the remaining tribes. The region is called "the Land of [[Canaan]]" (''Eretz Kna'an'') in {{bibleverse||Numbers|34:2|NIV}} and the borders are known in Jewish tradition as the "borders for those coming out of Egypt". These borders are again mentioned in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|1:6–8|NIV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|11:24|NIV}} and {{bibleverse||Joshua|1:4|NIV}}.

According to the Hebrew Bible, Canaan was the son of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] who with his descendants had seized the land from the descendants of [[Shem]] according to the [[Book of Jubilees]]. Jewish tradition thus refers to the region as Canaan during the period between [[Noah's Ark|the Flood]] and the Israelite settlement. [[Eliezer Schweid]] sees Canaan as a geographical name, and Israel the spiritual name of the land. He writes: ''The uniqueness of the Land of Israel is thus "geo-theological" and not merely climatic. This is the land which faces the entrance of the spiritual world, that sphere of existence that lies beyond the physical world known to us through our senses. This is the key to the land's unique status with regard to prophecy and prayer, and also with regard to the commandments''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Land of Israel: National Home Or Land of Destiny'', By Eliezer Schweid, Translated by Deborah Greniman, Published 1985 Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, {{ISBN|0-8386-3234-3}}, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the renaming of this landmarks a change in religious status, the origin of the [[Holy Land]] concept. {{bibleverse||Numbers|34:1–13|NIV}} uses the term Canaan strictly for the land west of the Jordan, but Land of Israel is used in Jewish tradition to denote the entire land of the Israelites. The English expression "[[Promised Land]]" can denote either the land promised to Abraham in Genesis or the land of Canaan, although the latter meaning is more common.

The border with Egypt is given as the ''Nachal Mitzrayim'' ([[Brook of Egypt]]) in Numbers, as well as in Deuteronomy and Ezekiel. Jewish tradition (as expressed in the commentaries of [[Rashi]] and [[Yehuda Halevi]], as well as the Aramaic [[Targum]]s) understand this as referring to the [[Nile]]; more precisely the [[Pelusium|Pelusian]] branch of the Nile Delta according to Halevi—a view supported by Egyptian and Assyrian texts. [[Saadia Gaon]] identified it as the "Wadi of El-Arish", referring to the biblical [[Sukkot]] near [[Faiyum]]. [[Kaftor Vaferech]] placed it in the same region, which approximates the location of the former Pelusian branch of the Nile. 19th century Bible commentaries understood the identification as a reference to the [[Wadi]] of the coastal locality called [[El-Arish]]. Easton's, however, notes a local tradition that the course of the river had changed and there was once a branch of the Nile where today there is a wadi. Biblical minimalists have suggested that the [[Besor]] is intended.

===Deuteronomy 19===
[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy%2019:8&amp;version=31 Deuteronomy 19:8] indicates a certain fluidity of the borders of the promised land when it refers to the possibility that God would "enlarge your borders." This expansion of territory means that Israel would receive "all the land he promised to give to your fathers", which implies that the settlement actually fell short of what was promised. According to [[Jacob Milgrom]], Deuteronomy refers to a more utopian map of the promised land, whose eastern border is the wilderness [[Transjordan (Bible)|rather than the Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Milgrom, ''Numbers'' (JPS Torah Commentary; Philadelphia: JPS, 1990), 502.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul R. Williamson notes that a "close examination of the relevant promissory texts" supports a "wider interpretation of the promised land" in which it is not "restricted absolutely to one geographical locale". He argues that "the map of the promised land was never seen permanently fixed, but was subject to at least some degree of expansion and redefinition."&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Williamson, "Promise and Fulfilment: The Territorial Inheritance", in Philip Johnston and Peter Walker (eds.), ''The Land of Promise: Biblical, Theological and Contemporary Perspectives'' (Leicester: Apollos, 2000), 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2 Samuel 24===
On [[King David|David]]'s instructions, [[Joab]] undertakes a [[census]] of Israel and Judah, travelling in an anti-clockwise direction from [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]] to [[Gilead]] to [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]], then west to [[Sidon]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], south to the cities of the [[Hivites]] and the [[Canaanites]], to southern Judah and then returning to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|24:5-8|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical commentator [[Alexander Kirkpatrick]] notes that the cities of Tyre and Sidon were "never occupied by the Israelites, and we must suppose either that the region traversed by the enumerators is defined as reaching up to though not including [them], or that these cities were actually visited in order to take a census of Israelites resident in them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/24.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on 2 Samuel 24], accessed 23 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ezekiel 47===
{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|47:13–20|NIV}} provides a definition of borders of land in which the [[twelve tribes of Israel]] will live during the final redemption, at the end of days. The borders of the land described by the text in Ezekiel include the northern border of modern [[Lebanon]], eastwards (the way of Hethlon) to [[Zedad]] and [[Hazar-enan]] in modern [[Syria]]; south by southwest to the area of [[Busra]] on the Syrian border (area of Hauran in Ezekiel); follows the [[Jordan River]] between the West Bank and the land of [[Gilead]] to Tamar ([[Ein Gedi]]) on the western shore of the Dead Sea; From Tamar to Meribah Kadesh ([[Kadesh Barnea]]), then along the [[Brook of Egypt]] (see debate below) to the Mediterranean Sea. The territory defined by these borders is divided into twelve strips, one for each of the twelve tribes.

Hence, Numbers 34 and Ezekiel 47 define different but similar borders which include the whole of contemporary [[Lebanon]], both the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[Israel]], except for the South Negev and [[Eilat]]. Small parts of [[Syria]] are also included.

The common biblical phrase used to refer to the territories actually settled by the Israelites (as opposed to military conquests) is "from [[Tel Dan|Dan]] to [[Beersheba]]" (or its variant "from Beersheba to Dan"), which occurs many times in the Bible. It is found in the biblical verses {{bibleverse||Judges|20:1|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|3:20|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:10|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|17:11|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|24:2|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|24:15|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Kings|4:25|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|21:2|NIV}}, and {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|30:5|NIV}}.

===Division of Tribes===
The 12 tribes of Israel are divided in 1 Kings 11. In the chapter, [[King Solomon]]'s sins lead to Israelites forfeiting 10 of the 12 tribes:
{{quote|1='''30''' and [[Ahijah the Shilonite|Ahijah]] took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces. '''31''' Then he said to [[Jeroboam]], “Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘See, I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon’s hand and give you ten tribes. '''32''' But for the sake of my servant David and the city of Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, he will have one tribe. '''33''' I will do this because they have forsaken me and worshiped [[Ashtoreth]] the goddess of the Sidonians, [[Chemosh]] the god of the Moabites, and [[Molek]] the god of the Ammonites, and have not walked in obedience to me, nor done what is right in my eyes, nor kept my decrees and laws as David, Solomon’s father, did.'''34''' “‘But I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon’s hand; I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant, whom I chose and who obeyed my commands and decrees. '''35''' I will take the kingdom from his son’s hands and give you ten tribes. '''36''' I will give one tribe to his son so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put my Name.|2=Kings 1, 11:30-11:36&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings+11&amp;version=NIV |title=1 Kings 11 NIV - Solomon’s Wives - King Solomon |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{History of Israel}}

===Rabbinic laws in the Land of Israel===
{{Main article|Laws and customs of the Land of Israel in Judaism}}{{anchor|Jewish religious beliefs}}
According to [[Menachem Lorberbaum]],&lt;blockquote&gt;In Rabbinic tradition, the land of Israel consecrated by the returning exiles was significantly different in it(s?) boundaries from both the prescribed biblical borders and the actual borders of the pre-Exilic kingdoms. It ranged roughly from Acre in the north to Ashkelon in the south along the Mediterranean, and included Galilee and the Golan. Yet there was no settlement in Samaria.&lt;ref&gt;Menachem Lorberbaum, ‘Making and Unmaking the Boundaries of Holy Land,’ in Allen E. Buchanan, Margaret Moore (eds) ''States, nations, and borders: the ethics of making boundaries.'' Cambridge University Press, 2003 pp19-40 p.24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Jewish religious law ([[halakha]]), some laws only apply to Jews living in the Land of Israel and some areas in [[Jordan]], Lebanon, and [[Syria]] (which are thought to be part of biblical Israel). These include agricultural laws such as the [[Shmita]] (Sabbatical year); tithing laws such as the [[Maaser Rishon]] ([[Levite Tithe]]), [[Maaser sheni]], and [[Maaser ani]] (poor tithe); charitable practices during farming, such as [[pe'ah]]; and laws regarding taxation. One popular source lists 26 of the 613 [[mitzvot]] as contingent upon the Land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;p.xxxv, R. Yisrael Meir haKohen ([[Chofetz Chayim]]), ''The Concise Book of Mitzvoth''. This version of the list was prepared in 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the religious laws which applied in ancient times are applied in the modern State of Israel; others have not been revived, since the State of Israel does not adhere to [[Mishpat Ivri|traditional Jewish law]]. However, certain parts of the current territory of the State of Israel, such as the [[Arabah]], are considered by some religious authorities to be outside the Land of Israel for purposes of Jewish law. According to these authorities, the religious laws do not apply there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohryerushalayim.org.il/halacha_topic.php?id=59 Yeshivat Ohr Yerushalayim, Shmita] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117153826/http://www.ohryerushalayim.org.il/halacha_topic.php?id=59 |date=17 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some [[posek|Jewish religious authorities]], every Jew has an obligation to dwell in the Land of Israel and may not leave except for specifically permitted reasons (e.g., to get married).&lt;ref&gt;The [[Nahmanides|Ramban]]'s addition to the [[Rambam]]'s Sefer HaMitzvot.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many laws dealing with how to treat the land. The laws apply to all Jews, and the giving of the land itself in the covenant, applies to all Jews, including converts.&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel 47:21 "You are to distribute this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. 22 You are to allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the aliens who have settled among you and who have children. You are to consider them as native-born Israelites; along with you they are to be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. 23 In whatever tribe the alien settles, there you are to give him his inheritance," declares the Sovereign LORD.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inheritance of the promise===
Traditional religious Jewish interpretation, and that of most Christian commentators, define Abraham's descendants only as Abraham's seed through his son [[Isaac]] and his grandson [[Jacob]].&lt;ref name="chabad"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godrules.net/library/edersheim/ederb1c10.htm |title=Edersheim Bible History – Bk. 1, Ch. 10 |publisher=Godrules.net |date=19 December 2006 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godrules.net/library/edersheim/ederb1c13.htm |title=Edersheim Bible History – Bk. 1, Ch. 13 |publisher=Godrules.net |date=19 December 2006 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gotothebible.com/Barnes/Genesis/15.html |title=Albert Barnes Notes on the Bible – Genesis 15 |publisher=Gotothebible.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studylight.org/com/geb/view.cgi?book=ge&amp;chapter=015&amp;verse=013 |title=Genesis – Chapter 15 – Verse 13 – The New John Gill Exposition of the Entire Bible on |publisher=Studylight.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/parshah/in-depth/default_cdo/aid/35872/jewish/In-Depth.htm |title=Parshah In-Depth – Lech-Lecha |publisher=Chabad.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible.org/qa.php?qa_id=496 |title=Did God send the angel to save Ishmael so that Islam could exist since Moslems believe Ishmael is the father of the Arabs? |publisher=Bible.org |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413154932/http://www.bible.org/qa.php?qa_id=496 |archivedate=13 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdmill.org/answers/answer.asp/category/ot/file/99780.qna |title=Reformed Answers: Ishmael and Esau |publisher=Thirdmill.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianleadershipcenter.org/me2.htm |title=The Promises to Isaac and Ishmael |publisher=Christianleadershipcenter.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonubf.org/BibleMaterials/Genesis2004/Genesis12_msg.html |title=God Calls Abram Abraham |publisher=Washingtonubf.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nigeriaworld.com/feature/publication/aneke/031706.html |title=Nigeriaworld Feature Article – The Abrahamic Covenant: Its scope and significance – A commentary on Dr. Malcolm Fabiyi's essay |publisher=Nigeriaworld.com |date=17 March 2006 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Friedrich Karl Keil]] is less clear, as he states that the covenant is through Isaac, but also notes that [[Ishmael]]'s descendants, generally the [[Arabs]], have held much of that land through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=F6NkmPGJKvIC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;lpg=PA264&amp;dq=%22keil%22+%2Bishmael#PPA224,M1 | title = Biblical commentary on the Old Testament | author1 = Keil | first1 = Carl Friedrich | last2 = Delitzsch | first2 = Franz | year = 1866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Jewish debates on the Land of Israel===
The Land of Israel concept has been [[Declaration of Independence of Israel|evoked by the founders of the State of Israel]]. It often surfaces in political debates on the status of the [[West Bank]], which is referred to in official Israeli discourse as [[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], from the names of the two [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|historical Israelite and Judean kingdoms]].&lt;ref name="Judea and Samaria" /&gt; These debates frequently invoke religious principles, despite the little weight these principles typically carry in Israeli secular politics.

Ideas about the need for Jewish control of the land of Israel have been propounded by figures such as [[Yitzhak Ginsburg]], who has written about the historical entitlement that Jews have to the whole Land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Ginsburgh, Rectifying the State of Israel (Israel: Gal Einai Institute, 2002), 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsburgh's ideas about the need for Jewish control over the land has some popularity within contemporary West Bank settlements.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |title = Pinḥas, the Quest for Purity, and the Dangers of Tikkun Olam |url = https://www.academia.edu/13433139/Pin%25E1%25B8%25A5as_the_Quest_for_Purity_and_the_Dangers_of_Tikkun_Olam |website = www.academia.edu |access-date = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are also strong backlashes from the Jewish community regarding these ideas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Satmar]] Hasidic community in particular denounces any geographic or political establishment of Israel, deeming this establishment has directly interfering with God's plan for Jewish redemption. [[Joel Teitelbaum]] was a foremost figure in this denouncement, calling the Land and State of Israel a vehicle for idol worship, as well as a smokescreen for Satan's workings.&lt;ref&gt;Teitelbaum, Al Ha-Ge‘ulah ve-al Ha-Temurah (1967), pp. 7-9, 20, as translated in Ravitzky, Messianism, Zionism, and Jewish Religious Radicalism, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christian beliefs ==

===Inheritance of the promise===
During the early 5th century, Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] argued in his ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' that the earthly or "carnal" kingdom of Israel achieved its [[wikt:acme|peak]] during the reigns of David and his son Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''The City of God (Book XVII)'', Chapter II. "And it was fulfilled through David, and Solomon his son, whose kingdom was extended over the whole promised space; for they subdued all those nations, and made them tributary. And thus, under those kings, the seed of Abraham was established in the land of promise according to the flesh, that is, in the land of Canaan..."&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say however, that this possession was conditional: "...the Hebrew nation should remain in the same land by the succession of posterity in an unshaken state even to the end of this mortal age, if it obeyed the laws of the Lord its God."

He goes on to say that the failure of the Hebrew nation to adhere to this condition resulted in its revocation{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the making of a second covenant and cites {{bibleref2|Jeremiah|31:31–32}}: "Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will make for the house of Israel, and for the house of Judah, a new testament: not according to the testament that I settled for their fathers in the day when I laid hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my testament, and I regarded them not, says the Lord."

Augustine concludes that this other promise, revealed in the New Testament, was about to be fulfilled through the incarnation of Christ: "I will give my laws in their mind, and will write them upon their hearts, and I will see to them; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people". Notwithstanding this doctrine stated by Augustine and also by the Apostle Paul in his [[Epistle to the Romans]] (Ch. 11), the phenomenon of [[Christian Zionism]] is widely noted today, especially among evangelical Protestants. Other Protestant groups and churches reject Christian Zionism [[Christian Zionism#Disapproval by other churches|on various grounds]].

== History ==
Jewish religious tradition does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon Zeitlin]], ''The Jews. Race, Nation, or Religion?'' (Philadelphia: [[Dropsie College]] Press, 1936). Cited in, Edelheit and Edelheit, ''History of Zionism: A Handbook and Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, during two millennia of exile and with a continuous yet small Jewish presence in the land, a strong sense of bondedness exists throughout this tradition, expressed in terms of people-hood; from the very beginning, this concept was identified with that ancestral biblical land or, to use the traditional religious and modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term, ''Eretz Yisrael''. Religiously and culturally the area was seen broadly as a land of destiny, and always with hope for some form of redemption and return. It was later seen as a national home and refuge, intimately related to that traditional sense of people-hood, and meant to show continuity that this land was always seen as central to Jewish life, in theory if not in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hershel Edelheit and Abraham J. Edelheit, [https://www.questia.com/library/book/history-of-zionism-a-handbook-and-dictionary-by-abfaham-j-edelheit-hershel-edelheit.jsp ''History of Zionism: A Handbook and Dictionary''], Westview Press, 2000. p 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman era===
{{main article|Ottoman Syria|Zionism}}
Having already used another religious term of great importance, [[Zion]] (Jerusalem), to coin the name of their movement, being associated with the return to Zion.&lt;ref&gt;De Lange, Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Judaism'', Cambridge University Press (2000), p. 30. {{ISBN|0-521-46624-5}}. The term "Zionism" was derived from the word Zion, which is the other name for Jerusalem, and is associated with the [[The Return to Zion|Return to Zion]] and coined by Austrian [[Nathan Birnbaum]], in his journal ''Selbstemanzipation'' (Self Emancipation) in 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was considered appropriate for the secular Jewish political movement of [[Zionism]] to adopt at the turn of the 20th century; it was used to refer to their proposed national homeland in the area then controlled by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. As originally stated, "The aim of Zionism is to create for the Jewish people a home in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] secured by law."&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_%22Basel_Program%22_at_the_First_Zionist_Congress_in_1897.jpg Basel Program]&lt;/ref&gt; Different geographic and political definitions for the "Land of Israel" later developed among competing Zionist ideologies during their nationalist struggle. These differences relate to the importance of the idea and its land, as well as the internationally recognized borders of the State of Israel and the Jewish State's secure and democratic existence. Many current governments, politicians and commentators question these differences.

=== British Mandate ===

The Biblical concept of Eretz Israel, and its re-establishment as a state in the modern era, was a [[Basel Program|basic tenet]] of the original [[Zionist]] program. This program however, saw little success until the British acceptance of "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people" in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]]. [[Chaim Weizmann]], as leader of the Zionist delegation, at the [[1919 Paris Peace Conference]] presented a Zionist Statement on 3 February. Among other things, he presented a plan for development together with a map of the proposed homeland. &lt;!-- I believe this map is available on wiki, and should be included. --&gt; The statement noted the Jewish historical connection with "[[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/zoparis.html 3 Feb 1919 Statement], quote "... recognize the historic title of the Jewish people to Palestine and the right of Jews to reconstitute in Palestine their National Home"&lt;/ref&gt; It also declared the Zionists' proposed borders and resources "essential for the necessary economic foundation of the country" including "the control of its rivers and their headwaters". These borders included present day Israel and the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]], western Jordan, southwestern Syria and southern Lebanon "in the vicinity south of Sidon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/zoparis.html |title=Zionist Organization Statement on Palestine, Paris Peace Conference, (February 3, 1919) |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent British occupation and British acceptance of the July 1922 League of Nations Mandate for Palestine,&lt;ref name="LoN Mandate for Palestine"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/The%20Mandate%20for%20Palestine | title=League of Nations Mandate for Palestine | publisher=Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs | date=24 July 1922 | accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; advanced the Zionist cause.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012|reason=Could not have been said by Weizmann in 1919 about a mandate adopted in 1922}}

Early in the deliberations toward British civilian administration, two fundamental decisions were taken, which bear upon the status of the Jews as a nation; the first was the recognition of Hebrew as an official language, along with English and Arabic, and the second concerned the Hebrew name of the country.

In 1920, the Jewish members of the first [[High Commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan|High Commissioner]]'s advisory council objected to the Hebrew transliteration of the word “Palestine” פלשתינה (''Palestina'') on the ground that the traditional name was ארץ ישראל (''Eretz Yisrael''), but the Arab members would not agree to this designation, which in their view, had political significance. The High Commissioner [[Herbert Samuel]], himself a [[Zionist]], decided that the Hebrew transliteration should be used, followed always by the two initial letters of "Eretz Yisrael,” א״י ''Aleph-Yod'':&lt;ref&gt;Israel Cohen, [https://archive.org/stream/shorthistoryofzi009976mbp/shorthistoryofzi009976mbp_djvu.txt A Short History of Zionism], p.96, London, Frederick Muller Co., 1951,&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;He was aware that there was no other name in the Hebrew language for this land except 'Eretz-Israel'. At the same time he thought that if 'Eretz-Israel' only were used, it might not be regarded by the outside world as a correct rendering of the word 'Palestine', and in the case of passports or certificates of nationality, it might perhaps give rise to passports or certificates of nationality, it might perhaps give rise to difficulties, so it was decided to print 'Palestine' in Hebrew letters and to add after it the letters 'Aleph' 'Yod', which constitute a recognised abbreviation of the Hebrew name. His Excellency still thought that this was a good compromise. Dr. Salem wanted to omit 'Aleph' 'Yod' and Mr. Yellin wanted to omit 'Palestine'. The right solution would be to retain both."&lt;br&gt; ''—Minutes of the meeting on November 9, 1920.''&lt;ref&gt;Meeting on November 9, 1920, quoted in: Memorandum No. 33, "Use of the Name Eretz-Israel’," in the Report by the Palestine Royal Commission, 1937, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hloOAQAAIAAJ Memoranda Prepared by the Government of Palestine], C. O. No. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The compromise was later noted as among Arab grievances before the League's Permanent Mandate Commission.&lt;ref&gt;League of Nations, Permanent Mandate Commission, [http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/1504facc47efbe05052565f0006b70bb?OpenDocument Minutes of the Ninth Session] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628180414/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/1504facc47efbe05052565f0006b70bb?OpenDocument |date=28 June 2011 }} (Arab Grievances), Held at Geneva from 8 to 25 June 1926&lt;/ref&gt; During the Mandate, the name ''Eretz Yisrael'' (abbreviated א״י ''Aleph-Yod''), was part of the official name for the territory, when written in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. These official names for Palestine were minted on the Mandate coins and early stamps (pictured) in English, Hebrew "(פלשתינה (א״י" (''Palestina E"Y'') and Arabic "( فلسطين"). Consequently, in 20th century political usage, the term "Land of Israel" usually denotes only those parts of the land which came under the British mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Israel's declaration of independence says "the British Mandate over ''Eretz Yisrael'', and the Israeli law uses the term ''Eretz Yisrael'' to denote the territory subject directly to the British Mandate law, e.g. Article 11 of the "Government and Law Ordinance 1948" issued by Israel's Provisional State Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 November 1947, the United Nations [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] adopted a resolution ([[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181]](II)) recommending "to the United Kingdom, as the mandatory Power for Palestine, and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation, with regard to the future government of Palestine, of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union." The Resolution contained a plan to partition Palestine into "Independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7f0af2bd897689b785256c330061d253 |title=UNITED NATIONS '&amp;#39;General Assembly: A/RES/181(II):29 November 1947Resolution 181 (II).

===Israeli period===
On May 14, 1948, the day the British Mandate over Palestine expired, the [[Jewish People's Council]] gathered at the Tel Aviv Museum, and [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|approved a proclamation]], in which it declared "the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel, to be known as the State of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Declaration+of+Establishment+of+State+of+Israel.htm Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs: ''THE DECLARATION OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL: May 14, 1948'']: Retrieved 24 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

When Israel was founded in 1948, the majority [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor]] leadership, which governed for three decades after independence, accepted the partition of the previous [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] into independent Jewish and Arab states as a pragmatic solution to the political and demographic issues of the territory, with the description Land of Israel applying to the territory of the State of Israel within the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012|reason=The Green Line was determined by the cease fire on 30 November 1948. Israel was declared as established 15 May 1948}} The then opposition [[Revisionist Zionism|revisionists]], who evolved into today's [[Likud]] party, however, regarded the rightful Land of Israel as ''Eretz Yisrael Ha-Shlema'' (literally, the whole Land of Israel), which came to be referred to as [[Greater Israel]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/22/weekinreview/the-world-pursuing-peace-netanyahu-and-his-party-turn-away-from-greater-israel.html?scp=4&amp;sq=ariel%20sharon&amp;st=nyt&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=The World: Pursuing Peace; Netanyahu and His Party Turn Away from Greater Israel |work=The New York Times |date=22 November 1998 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joel Greenberg, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' relates subsequent events this way:&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The seed was sown in 1977, when Menachem Begin of Likud brought his party to power for the first time in a stunning election victory over Labor. A decade before, in the 1967 war, Israeli troops had in effect undone the partition accepted in 1948 by overrunning the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ever since, Mr. Begin had preached undying loyalty to what he called Judea and Samaria (the West Bank lands) and promoted Jewish settlement there. But he did not annex the West Bank and Gaza to Israel after he took office, reflecting a recognition that absorbing the Palestinians could turn Israel it into a binational state instead of a Jewish one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 elections]] and the [[Oslo Accords]], the term Eretz Israel became increasingly associated with right-wing expansionist groups who sought to conform the borders of the State of Israel with the biblical ''Eretz Yisrael''.&lt;ref&gt;Raffaella A. Del Sarto, [http://ies.berkeley.edu/research/DelSartoIsraelMed.pdf Israel's Contested Identity and the Mediterranean, The territorial-political axis: Eretz Israel versus Medinat Israel, p. 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610164603/http://ies.berkeley.edu/research/DelSartoIsraelMed.pdf |date=10 June 2010}}

:Reflecting the traditional divisions within the Zionist movement, this axis invokes two concepts, namely Eretz Israel, i.e. the biblical "Land of Israel", and Medinat Israel, i.e. the Jewish and democratic State of Israel. While the concept of Medinat Israel dominated the first decades of statehood in accordance with the aspirations of Labour Zionism, the 1967 conquest of land that was part of "biblical Israel" provided a material basis for the ascent of the concept of Eretz Israel. Expressing the perception of rightful Jewish claims on "biblical land", the construction of Jewish settlements in the conquered territories intensified after the 1977 elections, which ended the dominance of the Labour Party. Yet as the first Intifada made disturbingly visible, Israel's de facto rule over the Palestinian population created a dilemma of democracy versus Jewish majority in the long run. With the beginning of Oslo and the option of territorial compromise, the rift between supporters of Eretz Israel and Medinat Israel deepened to an unprecedented degree, the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin in November 1995 being the most dramatic evidence.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==

===Usage in Israeli politics===
Early government usage of the term, following Israel's establishment, continued the historical link and possible Zionist intentions. In 1951–2 [[David Ben-Gurion]] wrote "Only now, after seventy years of pioneer striving, have we reached the beginning of independence in a part of our small country."&lt;ref&gt;David Ben-Gurion, "The Call of Spirit in Israel", in State of Israel, ''Government Yearbook, 5712'' (1951/1952), page x.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards he wrote "It has already been said that when the State was established it held only six percent of the Jewish people remaining alive after the Nazi cataclysm. It must now be said that it has been established in only a portion of the Land of Israel. Even those who are dubious as to the restoration of the historical frontiers, as fixed and crystallised and given from the beginning of time, will hardly deny the anomaly of the boundaries of the new State."&lt;ref&gt;David Ben-Gurion, "Israel among the Nations", in State of Israel, ''Government Year-book, 5713'' (1952), page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1955 Israeli government year-book said, "It is called the 'State of Israel' because it is part of the Land of Israel and not merely a Jewish State. The creation of the new State by no means derogates from the scope of historical Eretz Israel".&lt;ref&gt;State of Israel, "Israel, the State and the Nation" in ''Government Year-book, 5716'' (1955), page 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herut]] and [[Gush Emunim]] were among the first Israeli political parties basing their land policies on the Biblical narrative discussed above. They attracted attention following the capture of [[Israeli-occupied territories|additional territory]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. They argue that the West Bank should be annexed permanently to Israel for both ideological and religious reasons. This position is in conflict with the basic "[[land for peace]]" settlement formula included in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|UN242]]. The [[Likud]] party, in the platform it maintained until prior to the [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|2013 elections]], had proclaimed its support for maintaining Jewish settlement communities in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], as the territory is considered part of the historical land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title = Likud – Platform| publisher = knesset.gov.il| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204131140/https://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm|archivedate= 2012-02-04 |url= https://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm |accessdate=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2009 bid for Prime Minister, [[Kadima]] leader [[Tzipi Livni]] used the expression, noting, "we need to give up parts of the Land of Israel", in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and to maintain Israel as a Jewish state; this drew a clear distinction with the position of her Likud rival and winner, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Tzipi Livni: give up half of Land of Israel| work = The Telegraph| accessdate = 2015-04-23| date = 2009-02-16| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/4642371/Tzipi-Livni-give-up-half-of-Land-of-Israel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, soon after winning the 2009 elections, Netanyahu delivered an address&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/full-text-of-netanyahu-s-foreign-policy-speech-at-bar-ilan-1.277922 |title=Full text of Binyamin Netanyahu's Bar Ilan speech|date=15 June 2009|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies]] at [[Bar-Ilan University]] that was broadcast live in Israel and across parts of the [[Arab world]], on the topic of the [[Middle East peace process]]. He endorsed for the first time the notion of a [[Palestinian state]] alongside Israel, while asserting the right to a sovereign state in Israel arises from the land being "the homeland of the Jewish people".&lt;ref name=lays&gt;{{cite news |title=Netanyahu wants demilitarized PA state |first=Herb |last=Keinon |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=145486 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=14 June 2009 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace]], signed on 1993, led to the establishment of an agreed border between the two nations, and subsequently the state of Israel has no territorial claims in the parts of the historic Land of Israel lying east of the Jordan river.

===Palestinian viewpoints===
According to Palestinian historian [[Nur Masalha]], ''Eretz Israel'' was a religious concept which was turned by Zionists into a political doctrine in order to emphasize an exclusive Jewish right of possession regardless of the Arab presence.{{sfn|Masalha|2007|p=2-6}} Masalha wrote that the Zionist movement has not given up on an expansive definition of the territory, including Jordan and more, even though political pragmatism has engendered a focus on the region west of the Jordan River.{{sfn|Masalha|2007|pp=32–38}}

Canada's role in the development of [[peacekeeping]] during the 20th century led to the establishment of [[Canada]] as a prominent world power. Canada's commitment to multilateralism has been closely related to [[History of United Nations peacekeeping|peacekeeping efforts]]. Canadian [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Lester B. Pearson]] is considered to be the father of modern [[United Nations]] Peacekeeping.&lt;ref name="Sharma2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Banerjee &amp; Sharma|title=Reinventing the United Nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-xHSiPhueEC&amp;pg=PA63|date=1 March 2008|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

=== Series 1 (2016) ===
Writing on the series began in February 2015 with [[principal photography]] commencing 29 June and wrapping in mid-August. The show was shot entirely on location due to no studio space being available in the UK. "But you can just be completely mobile now, and set up a video village anywhere", explained Ullman to Televisual magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.televisual.com/blog-detail/Tracey-Ullman-one-of-a-kind_bid-847.html|title=Tracey Ullman: one of a kind|work=Televisual|publisher=Televisual.com|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sketch featuring Ullman playing [[Cilla Black]] was filmed and scrapped after the star's untimely death in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz-tv/hot-tv/485796/BBC-Cilla-skit|title=BBC forced to axe bad taste Cilla skit|publisher=Daily Star|date=6 January 2016|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audience screenings and recordings took place in September 2015 at [[Broadcasting House|BBC Radio Theatre]].&lt;ref name=productiondata&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/the_tracey_ullman_show/details/|title=Tracey Ullman's Show production data|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|date=|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC announced that the programme had been recommissioned for a second series on 5 March 2016. In a press release, Ullman stated: "It has been a pleasure being back at the BBC, and I am thrilled to get the opportunity to write more shows with my brilliant team. The warm reception from the British public has meant a lot to me personally. I want to thank them and let Dame Judi Dench and Chancellor Angela Merkel know I couldn’t have done it without you girls.

According to the ''Radio Times'', Ullman is set to impersonate [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] leader [[Nicola Sturgeon]], 'who will played like a Bond villain, living in a Tartan Lair with a white Scottie dog on her lap,' as well as an "eerily accurate" Clare Balding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-10-10/tracey-ullman-lines-up-new-impressions-of-nicola-sturgeon-and-clare-balding|title=Tracey Ullman lines up new impressions of Nicola Sturgeon and Clare Balding|publisher=RadioTimes.com|date=10 October 2016|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; English impressionist Luke Kempner was revealed to be joining the series.

[[Brexit]] plays a part in the show's storyline. "This series, we wrote some material for the Angela Merkel character, but then two days before shooting we had the Brexit vote, which sidelined a lot of that material. So we had to do some very quick rewriting and produced a song about how she feels all alone now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/2711339/tracey-ullman-dame-judi-denchs-daughter-watch-my-sketches/|title=A GOOD IMPRESSION Tracey Ullman: ‘Dame Judi Dench's daughter says they watch my sketches at home’|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It made it better, more poignant", says Ullman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/10/tracey-ullman-show-hbo-bbc-judi-dench-maggie-smith-angela-merkel-1201741293/|title=Tracey Ullman Says Her New HBO Sketch Series is the Antidote to TV's Rash of Bleak Comedies|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bucks, UK: Brant Travel Guides, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-sr|Поморавље}} / ''Pomoravlje'', {{IPA-sh|pɔmɔ̝̌raːvʎe̞|pron}}), is a general term which in its widest sense marks [[valley]]s of any of three Morava rivers in [[Serbia]]: the [[West Morava]] ([[West Morava Valley]]), the [[South Morava]] ([[South Morava Valley]]) and the [[Great Morava]] ([[Great Morava Valley]]). In the narrow sense, the term is applied only to the '''Great Morava Valley''' ({{lang-sr|Велико Поморавље}} / ''Veliko Pomoravlje''). The Serbian term follows the general manner of coining river valley names in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] using the prefix ''po-'' and suffix ''-je'', meaning literally "(land) along the Morava". Morava valley lies in the central [[Balkans]], at the crossroads which lead eastwards, towards the [[Black sea]] and [[Asia Minor]], and further south, down the [[Vardar]] river into the [[Aegean sea]].

===Location===

The '''West Morava Valley''' ({{lang-sr|Западно Поморавље}} / ''Zapadno Pomoravlje'') is the [[valley]] of the [[West Morava]]. It is the southernmost Peripannonic region of Serbia. It is parallel, [[latitude|latitudinally]] elongated, in the west-to-east direction, opposed to the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]], south-to-north direction of South Morava Valley and Great Morava Valley. It occupies and area of 5,220 square kilometers and generally corresponds to the valley of the West Morava River and sections of its watershed around the rivers of [[Skrapež]], [[Đetinja]] (headwaters of West Morava) and [[Rasina (river)|Rasina]] (a tributary, near the confluence with South Morava). It is generally bounded by the mountains of [[Tara Mountain|Tara]], [[Zlatibor]], [[Jelica]], [[Goč]], [[Suvobor]], [[Maljen]], [[Kotlenik]] and [[Gledić]], that is, by the large geographical regions of [[Šumadija]] and [[Stari Vlah]]

===Geography===
The West Morava Valley is a [[wikt:composite|composite]] valley, which means it consists of a sequence of valleys (depressions) and gorges. Sections include:

* The Požega Depression (''Požeška kotlina'') - starting point of the West Morava Valley. Tašti field is a place where rivers of Skrapež, Đetinja and [[Golijska Moravica]] meet to create West Morava. Depression is located between the mountains of [[Krstac]] on the east, [[Blagaja]] on the south, [[Crna Kosa]] on the north-west and [[Loret]] on the north-east. Depression is known for frequent fogs, due to the abundance in water sources (tributaries of Bjelica, Kravarička reka, Lužnica). Central settlement is the town of [[Požega (Serbia)|Požega]] and smaller settlements are [[Lučani]] and [[Gorobilje]].
* The [[Ovčar-Kablar Gorge]] (''Ovčarsko-kablarska klisura'') - a narrow of the West Morava valley, between the mountains of [[Ovčar]] (985 meters) on the south and [[Kablar]] (885 meters) on the north. The gorge is a meandering and 15 kilometers long. Epigynous in nature, it is a crucial for the genesis of the entire West Morava Valley. The gorge is a location of Ovčar Spa and 10 [[Serbian Orthodox]] monasteries, which is why the gorge has been nicknamed Serbian [[Mount Athos]]. There are two hydro electrical power plants with artificial lakes: ''Ovčar'' and ''Međuvršje''.
* The Čačak-Kraljevo Depression (''Čačansko-kraljevačka kotlina'') - the largest tectonic-erosive depression of all in the valley. It covers an area of 270 square kilometers and is elongated for 40 kilometers. Despite being this long, it is located between only three mountains: Kotlenik on the north and Jelica and [[Stolovi]] on the south. West Morava receives many tributaries in this area. Apart from [[Ibar river]], the longest tributary to West Morava, and [[Gruža (river)|Gruža]], most of them are short and include Dičina, Lađevačka reka, Ribnica, etc. Main settlements are the towns of [[Čačak]], the most populous settlement in the entire West Morava Valley, and [[Kraljevo]]. Other smaller settlements include [[Preljina]], [[Mrčajevci]], [[Ribnica (Kraljevo)|Ribnica]], [[Adrani]], [[Konarevo]], [[Žiča]], etc., most of them suburbs of either Čačak or Kraljevo.
* The Vrnjci Depression (''Vrnjačka kotlina'') - widening at the confluence of the small Vrnjačka and Lipovačka rivers. Area, located between the mountains of Gledić on the north and Goč on the south, is rich in [[mineral springs]]. The most popular Serbian [[mineral spa]], [[Vrnjačka Banja]] is located in the depression. Other settlements include [[Vrnjci]], [[Gračac]] and [[Novo Selo (Vrnjačka Banja)|Novo Selo]].
* The Trstenik Depression (''Trstenička kotlina'') - depression centered around the town of [[Trstenik, Serbia|Trstenik]], direct extension of Vrnjci depression. Agricultural area, other settlements include larger villages of [[Medveđa]] and [[Velika Drenova]].
* The Kruševac Depression (''Kruševačka kotlina'') - final section of the West Morava Valley, a large widening at the confluence with South Morava which directly extends into the Great Morava Valley  on the north. Itself, extends into the south in the valley of the Rasina River and it is bounded by the [[Jastrebac]] mountain on the south. The largest settlement is the town of [[Kruševac]] and its suburbs of [[Parunovac]], [[Pepeljevac (Kruševac)|Pepeljevac]], [[Jasika (Kruševac)|Jasika]], etc. [[Lake Ćelije|Artificial lake of Ćelije]] is created on the Rasina.

===Sub-regions===

The largest is in the area of Čačak (184 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and the smallest in the neighboring area of Lučani (54 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Despite large urban centers, population has been depopulating for almost two decades. The population of the Morava Valley by the official censuses of population:

* 1948 - 375,798
* 1953 - 417,667
* 1961 - 448,393

===Economy===
The West Morava Valley is economically the most developed of all three Morava river valleys. Being a large floodplain, frequently flooded by the West Morava due to the extreme fluctuation of its discharge, The West Morava Valley was always an agricultural area, but in the second half of 20th century industry also developed in all major towns along the river.

====Agriculture====

Fertile land in the valley is best for grains and orchards. Corn is being cultivated in the Čačak-Kraljevo depression, while wheat is being grown in the Kruševac depression. Dragačevo region is known for the potato production. Čačak area is known for the plum growing, Požega is known for the apples ("budimka" brand) and Župa region around Aleksandrovac is famous for the grapes and wine production. Artificial lake Parmenac near Čačak is created for the purpose of irrigation and further fertilization of the land. Also, out of all three sections of the Morava Valley, the West Morava Valley is the most forested one.

====Mining and industry====

The West Morava Valley is rich in [[ore]]s. It includes the mining of [[brown coal]] ("West Morava's coal basin"), [[hard coal]], [[asbestos]], [[magnesite]], [[chromium]], etc. As a result, the industry is very developed with a string of heavily industrialized towns: Požega, Čačak, Kraljevo, Trstenik and Kruševac. With the valley of the Ibar, the West Morava has a huge potential in electricity production. Hydroelectric power plants Ovčar (6 MW) and Međuvršje (7 MW) with artificial lakes are built near Čačak, in the Ovčar-Kablar gorge, so as the lakes Parmenac (also on Morava) and Ćelije (on Rasina).

====Transportation and tourism====

The entire river valley is a natural route for both roads and railways connecting eastern, central and western Serbia, so traffic is also important for the economy of the region. Tourism is almost entirely based on mineral spas, as the West Morava Valley is dubbed "First spa region of Serbia". Best known spas include Vrnjačka Banja, Mataruška Banja, [[Bogutovačka Banja]], Ovčar Banja, [[Vička Banja]], [[Gornja Trepča]], etc. Additional interests are the Goč mountain and medieval [[Serbian Orthodox]] monasteries of Žiča, [[Kalenić Monastery|Kalenić]], [[Lazarica]], [[Ljubostinja]], [[Naupara]], etc. One of top mountain resorts of Serbia, [[Tara Mountain|Tara]] and [[Zlatibor]], are marking the eastern border of the region.

The '''South Morava Valley''' ({{lang-sr|Јужно Поморавље}} / ''Južno Pomoravlje'') is the [[valley]] of the [[South Morava]]. It is the southernmost region of Serbia, bordering [[Republic of Macedonia]].  It is meridionally elongated, in the south-to-north direction. In the narrower sense, as a valley of the South Morava, it occupies an area of 4,800&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of which 1,660&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on Kosovo and the rest in Central Serbia. In wider sense, the South Morava Valley is identified with southern Serbia in general and covers the entire watershed of the South Morava (15,469&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

===Geography===
* Končulj Gorge (''Končuljska klisura'') - gorge in the original section of South Morava, while it is still being called Binačka Morava. It connects sub-regions of [[Izmornik]] on Kosovo and [[Bujanovac]] section of the Vranje depression. Gorge is 11 kilometers long, cut by Morava in the [[gneiss]]-[[granite]] rocks of the northernmost extension of the [[Skopska Crna Gora]] mountain. It was named after the village of Končulj and forms a natural route for the Vranje-Bujanovac-[[Gnjilane]] road.
* Vranje Depression (''Vranjska kotlina'') - larger widening of the valley mainly bordered by the mountains of Skopska Crna Gora on the south-west, [[Rujen]] on the south, [[Sveti Ilija]] on the west, [[Kukavica]] on the north and [[Besna Kobila]] on the east. Center of the depression is the town of [[Vranje]] and other settlements include [[Vranjska Banja]], [[Veliki Trnovac]], [[Bujanovac]] and [[Preševo]]. Sometimes called Vranje-Preševo depression, with northern section mostly corresponds to the sub-region of [[Inogošte]], while southern, through the ''Preševska povija'' ridge extends to the south into the region of [[Žegligovo]] and [[Pčinja (river)|Pčinja]] valley in the Republic of Macedonia.
* Grdelica Gorge (''Grdelička klisura'') - one of the most famous gorges in Serbia, a valley narrow which is 33 kilometers long (48 by the river course) and up to 550 meters deep. Gorge is carved between the mountains of Kukavica on the west and [[Čemernik]] on the east. The highest point above the gorge is [[orographic]] ([[geomorphology|geomorphological]]) water divide of the [[Pannonian Basin|Pannonian]] and [[Aegean sea|Aegean basins]], which doesn't correspond with [[hydrological]] divide of the South Morava watershed (which spread south of it, too). Due to the [[deforestation]], Grdelica gorge is an area of excessive [[erosion]], which is the main reason for the elevation of the river bed of the Great Morava downstream and flooding in the Great Morava Valley. In the gorge area, erosion as a result has floods, torrents, [[inundation]]s, trenching, etc. Largest settlement, [[Vladičin Han]] is at the entrance, while [[Grdelica (town)|Grdelica]], after which the gorge is named, at the exit. Other settlements in the gorge include [[Džep]] and [[Predejane]].
* Leskovac Depression (''Leskovačka kotlina'') is a main section of the larger Leskovac field (''Leskovačko polje''), the largest [[fluvial]]-[[tectonic]] depression in the valley. A 50 kilometers in [[diameter]], it was completed flooded by the lake in [[Neogene]]. Today it is a place where many important South Morava's tributaries flow in it: [[Jablanica (river)|Jablanica]], [[Veternica]], [[Vlasina]], etc. The area is one of the best known vegetable growing regions in Serbia, especially for tomatoes and [[bell pepper]]s. It encompasses several sub-regions (Jablanica, Vlasina) and due to its size, it is bordered by almost a dozen of mountains. It roughly corresponds to the region of  [[Dubočica]]. Largest settlement is the town of [[Leskovac]], fourth largest town in Central Serbia. Other settlements include [[Vlasotince]] and [[Vučje]].
* Pečenjevce [[defile (geography)|Defile]] (''Pečenjevačka sutjeska'') - small gorge which connects Leskovac field and Brestovac micro-depression, carved through the western slopes of the [[Babička Gora]] mountain.
* Brestovac Micro-depression (''Brestovačka kotlinica'') - actually, the northernmost extension of the Leskovac field. It is located between the mountains of Babička Gora and [[Seličevica]] on the east, and [[Pasjača (mountain)|Pasjača]] on the west. In the west it extends into the regions of [[Toplica District|Toplica]] and [[Pusta river (South Morava)|Pusta reka]]. Remains of the medieval town ruins of "Kurvin Grad" are located above the depression.

[[Image:Nisgradnocu.jpg|thumb|250px| Niš]]

* Niš-Aleksinac Depression (''Niško-aleksinačka kotlina'') - most populous section of the valley, thanks to the city [[Niš]], second largest town in [[Central Serbia]], or popularly styled "metropolis of southern Serbia". Depression roughly begins at the village of [[Malošište]] and ends at historical settlement of [[Đunis]]. Long and elongated, its borders are marked by the mountains of Seličevica on the south-east, [[Ozren (Sokobanja)|Ozren]] on the east, [[Bukovik (mountain)|Bukovik]] on the north-east, [[Veliki Jastrebac]] and [[Mali Jastrebac]] on the west and Pasjača on the south-west. Apart from Niš, other important settlements in the depression include the string of Niš' suburbs and the town of [[Aleksinac]]. Sometimes considered a two separate depressions, Niš and Aleksinac.
* Stalać Gorge (''Stalaćka klisura'') - the final narrow of the South Morava Valley before it meets the West Morava to form the Great Morava. The gorge is 20 kilometers long and 350 meters deep, carved in the form of the typical base epigyny (cut through the middle of the massif's base), with "pitched" [[meander]]s among the Stalać Hills (Poslonjska and Mojsinjska mountains), part of the extreme north-west section of the [[Rhodope Mountains]]. Named after the small town of [[Stalać]] at the exit of the gorge.

===Sub-regions===
Sub-regions which partially make up the South Morava Valley include:

===Population===
The South Morava Valley had a population of 719,151 inhabitants by the 2002 census of population, with an average population density of 150 inhabitants per square kilometer, but the area's density is in general smaller, average density being enlarged by the large centers like the city of Niš (420 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The South Morava Valley has been known for rural depopulation almost for the last six decades while the cities grew larger, but in the last 30 years the entire area is depopulating. The population of the Morava Valley by the official censuses of population:

* 1948 - 544,652
* 1953 - 568,429
* 1961 - 611,163
* 1971 - 673,618

====Agriculture====

The South Morava Valley is the major vegetable growing area in Serbia, especially the areas of Leskovac and Vranje, which are specialized in the production of tomatoes and bell peppers, but other early vegetables as well. Vranje is also known for [[floriculture]]. The area is also producing grains (corn in Leskovac and Vranje, wheat in Vranje and Aleksinac- Niš region), fruits (plums in Vranje, grapes in Leskovac) and industrial plants (sugar beet in Aleksinac- Niš, tobacco in Aleksinac- Niš and Vranje). Leskovac is also known for the [[poultry]]. Water from South Morava is also used for the irrigation.

====Mining and industry====

The mountains surrounding the region are rich in minerals and ores. The mountain of Besna Kobila has findings of [[zinc]] and [[silver]]. Other findings include [[chromium]], [[antimony]], [[graphite]], [[molybdenum]] and [[tungsten]]. [[Oil shale]]s are found near Vranje and Aleksinac. Aleksinac is also part of a large Aleksinac coal basin. Though South Morava has a significant potential for electricity production, it has not been dammed, though some parts of its watershed on the east (Vlasina, Vrla) have a series of hydro electrical plants (Vrla I, II, III and IV). Area is rich in mineral springs with many spas: Vranjska Banja, Bujanovčaka Banja, Ribarska Banja, Kulinska Banja, Klokot Banja, etc. There are several large industrial centers in the region, some of them among the largest in Serbia (Niš, Leskovac, Vranje). Secondary centers are Aleksinac and Vlasotince.

====Transportation====

Along with the Great Morava Valley, its natural continuation, the South Morava Valley is an important European transportation route and Niš is a major crossroads. It makes a section of the Belgrade-[[Skopje]]-[[Thessaloniki]] route, that is, of the [[European route E75]] (which connects [[Norway]] and [[Greece]]), with a branch splitting at Niš for [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], which is actually a crossroads of the routes E75 and [[European route E80|E80]] which connects [[Portugal]] and [[Turkey]]. Except for the Leskovac-Macedonian border section, route has been turned into a highway. The South Morava Valley is also a railway crossroads: railway Belgrade-Niš-Skopje, trans-Balkan railway [[Peć]]-[[Prahovo]], etc.

===Location===
The '''Great Morava Valley''' ({{lang-sr|Велико Поморавље}} / ''Veliko Pomoravlje'') is the [[valley]] of the [[Great Morava]]. It is often referred to only as the '''Morava Valley''' ({{lang-sr|Поморавље}} / ''Pomoravlje''; [[Pomoravlje District]] is located in the southern area of the Great Morava Valley). It the beginning, it is bounded by the mountains of [[Juhor]] on the west and [[Kučaj]] on the east. In the later section, the Morava Valley gets much wider, with only smaller hills bounding it and opens widely to the [[Danube]] and [[Banat]] region, across the river. It covers an area of 4,360 square milometers, which is over 70% of the entire Great Morava watershed.

===Geography===

The Great Morava Valley is a valley region of the middle, Peripannonic Serbia. In the Neogene, it was a deep bay ("Morava Bay") of the inner [[Pannonian Sea]], which flowed off through the [[Đerdap]] gorge 600,000 years ago. As the sea withdrew, the Great Morava cut in its flow through the drained bay, almost for 500 meters. The region is 120 kilometers long and up to 40 kilometers wide. Altitudes vary from 75 meters on the north to 130 meters on the south. It has a tempered continental climate with not much rainfall but frequend floods. Composite valley of the Great Morava has three main sections.

* The Upper Great Morava or Ćuprija Depression (''Gornjovelikomoravska or Ćuprijska kotlina'') - southern half of the Great Morava Valley, located between the mountains of Juhor (east) and Kučaj (west). After the Neogene phase, in which the depression was the southernmost extension of the Pannonian Sea, the Great Morava cut through from the relative elevation of 350 meters ("Five Morava Plateaus"). It has three larger ([[Paraćin]], [[Ćuprija]] and [[Jagodina]]) and two towns ([[Varvarin]], [[Ćićevac]]), so as several large villages. In this section, the Great Morava receives the tributaries of Kalenićka Reka, [[Lugomir]], Belica (from the left), [[Crnica]] and [[Ravanica]] (from the right).
* The Bagrdan Gorge (''Bagrdanska klisura'') - wide gorge, epigynously cut in the nearby hills. It is 17 kilometers long and it is the final gorge of the entire Morava course. It was named after the village of [[Bagrdan]]. River Osanica flows into the Great Morava from the left in the gorge. In the 1980s, the gorge was planned for the hydro electrical dam construction and creation of a reservoire.
* The Lower Great Morava or Požarevac Depression (''Donjovelikomoravska or Požarevačka kotlina'') - northern half, ending section of the entire Morava river system, where it finally empties into the Danube. Very wide and open to the north ([[Pannonian Plain]]), with two larger cities, [[Smederevo]] and [[Požarevac]].

===Sub-regions===
Regions, which partially or completely make the Great Morava Valley, include [[Jasenica region|Jasenica]], [[Lepenica (region)|Lepenica]], [[Resava (river)#Region|Resava]] and [[Temnić]]. Because the Great Morava and West Morava are considered the eastern and southern borders, respectively, of the super-region of [[Šumadija]], they largely overlap with it in these areas.

===Population===
The South Morava Valley had a population of 545,517 inhabitants by the 2002 census of population, with an average population density of 125 inhabitants per square kilometer. Extremes include Smederevo, with 230 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[Despotovac]], with 41 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Despite being developed as an agricultural and industrial region, it has been depopulating for the last few decades. The population of the Morava Valley by the official censuses of population:

* 1948 - 495,903
* 1953 - 530,335
* 1961 - 565,584
* 1971 - 594,934
* 1981 - 632,984
* 1991 - 586,033
* 2002 - 545,517

In the 1980s plans were made to join towns of Jagodina, Paraćin and Ćuprija into the first planned [[conurbation]] in [[Yugoslavia]], including inter-city [[tram]]way lines, etc., but the idea was dropped later. The largest settlements of the Great Morava Valley in 2002 were:

====Agriculture====

With the most fertile arable land, almost endless gardens, orchards and vineyards and its intensive agriculture, the Great Morava Valley is the granary of Central Serbia. The Great Morava agricultural region covers much larger area than the Great Morava Valley or even the watershed of the Great Morava: regions of Mlava and [[Pek (river)|Pek]] on the east ([[Braničevo District]]) and almost half of [[Šumadija]], on the west. Main products in the valley are corn, wheat, [[sugar beet]] and sunflower. Hilly areas surrounding the valley are producing fruits, grapes (Smederevo), [[fodder]] plants and livestock. Braničevo region has the largest production of [[beans]] in Serbia. Horse [[stud farm]] [[Ljubičevo]] is located near Požarevac. In the past centuries the Great Morava Valley was famous for its vast forest, but today it is almost entirely turned into an arable land.

====Mining and industry====

Unlike the West Morava Valley and South Morava Valley, the Great Morava Valley has almost no ores or minerals, except for the [[cement]] [[marl]] near Paraćin. But the area has vast finding of coal, near Kostolac (Kostolac-Podunavlje Basin; [[brown coal]]), in the valley of [[Resava (river)|Resavica]] (Despotovac Basin; brown coal at Makvište and Resavica, [[lignite]] at Despotovac) and near Ćuprija (Senje Basin; brown coal). Also, the Great Morava Valley has only a few mineral springs (Lućička Banja, Stragarska Banja, etc.). Major industrial centers are Jagodina, Smederevo, Smederevska Palanka and Ćuprija, followed by Paraćin, Požarevac and Velika Plana. [[Thermal power plant]] "Morava" (125 [[megawatt|MW]]) is located near Svilajnac.  One of three Serbian cement plants is located in [[Popovac]] (formerly "Novi Popovac", in 2002 bought by one of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] cement company [[Holcim]]).

====Transportation====

The Great Morava Valley was always an important traffic route. In [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, it was the location of [[Via Militaris]], while in the medieval period [[Constantinople]] road ran through. Today, it makes a section of the European route E75 (Belgrade-Niš highway) which continues into the South Morava Valley. It also a route for the Belgrade-Niš railway. In past times, the Great Morava used to be navigable, but due to the huge amounts of materials which are brought by the South Morava, as a result of extreme erosion in its watershed, the river bed of the Great Morava is literally being covered up so the river is not navigable today. Only some 3 kilometers near its mouth into the Danube can be used for navigation.

[[File:Ponce City Hall.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Ponce City Hall]], in the city of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], [[Puerto Rico]], is the seat of the government for both the city and the surrounding ''[[barrio]]s'' making up the municipality.]]

[[File:Map of all City Municipalities in Slovenia.svg|thumb|right|Map of all city municipalities in Slovenia]]
A '''municipality''' is usually a single [[Urban area|urban]] [[administrative division]] having [[Municipal corporation|corporate]] status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished (usually) from the [[county]], which may encompass [[rural]] territory or numerous small communities such as [[town]]s, [[village]]s and [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s.

The term ''municipality'' may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/municipality?show=0&amp;t=1310881057
  |title=Municipality
  |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a [[special-purpose district]].

The term is derived from [[French language|French]] ''municipalité'' and [[Latin language|Latin]] ''municipalis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/municipality
  |title=municipality definition
  |publisher=Yourdictionary.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English language|English]] word ''municipality'' derives from the Latin [[social contract]] ''[[municipium]]'' (derived from a word meaning "duty holders"), referring to the Latin communities that supplied Rome with troops in exchange for their own incorporation into the Roman state (granting [[Roman citizenship]] to the inhabitants) while permitting the communities to retain their own local governments (a limited autonomy).

A municipality can be any political [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] from a sovereign state, such as the [[Principality of Monaco]], to a small village, such as [[West Hampton Dunes, New York]].

The territory over which a municipality has jurisdiction may encompass
* only one [[populated place]] such as a [[city]], town, or village
* several of such places (e.g., early jurisdictions in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]] (1798–1899) as [[Township (New Jersey)|townships]] governing several villages, [[Municipalities of Mexico]], [[Municipalities of Colombia]])
* only parts of such places, sometimes boroughs of a city such as the 34 municipalities of [[Santiago]], Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://mapasdechile.com/santiago/map.htm
  |title=Santiago de Chile – Comunas
  |publisher=Mapas de Chile, Castor y Polux Ltda
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political powers==
Powers of municipalities range from virtual autonomy to complete subordination to the [[State (polity)|state]]. Municipalities may have the right to tax individuals and corporations with [[income tax]], [[property tax]], and [[corporate income tax]], but may also receive substantial funding from the state.

==In various countries==

In various countries, municipalities are usually referred to as "{{visible anchor|communes}}", notably in Romance languages (derived from Latin) such as French ''{{wiktfra|commune}}'' ([[Communes of France|France]], French-speaking areas of Belgium and Switzerland, French-speaking countries of Africa, e.g. [[Communes of Benin|Benin]]), Italian ''{{lang|it|[[comune]]}}'', Romanian ''{{wiktron|comună}}'', and Spanish ''{{wiktspa|comuna}}'' ([[Communes of Chile|Chile]]), and in Germanic languages such as German ''{{wiktdeu|Kommune}}'' (in political parlance, the official term being {{lang|de|[[Gemeinde (Germany)|Gemeinde]]}}), Swedish ''{{wiktswe|kommun}}'', Faroese ''{{wiktfo|kommuna}}'', and Norwegian, Danish ''{{lang|da|{{lang|no|[[wikt:kommune|kommune]]}}}}''. However, in Moldova and Romania exists both ''municipalities'' (''municipiu''; urban administrative units) and ''communes'' (''comună''; rural units), and a commune may be part of a municipality (see more: [[communes of Moldova]], [[communes of Romania]]).

Similar terms include Spanish ''{{lang|es|[[ayuntamiento]]}}'', also called ''{{lang|es|[[municipalidad]]}}'' (cognate to "municipality"), Polish ''{{lang|pl|[[gmina]]}}'', Dutch/Flemish ''{{wiktnl|Gemeente}}'' and Luxembourgish ''{{wiktlb|Gemeng}}''.

*In [[Australia]], the term [[local government area]] (LGA) is used in place of the generic municipality. Here, the "LGA Structure covers only incorporated areas of Australia. Incorporated areas are legally designated parts of states and territories over which incorporated local governing bodies have responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/9f0b5791ed98061fca256f1900128409?OpenDocument |title=Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[India]], a Municipality or [[Nagar Palika (Municipality)|Nagar Palika]]  is an urban local body that administers a city of population 100,000 or more. However, there are exceptions to that, as previously Municipality were constituted in urban centers with population over 20,000, so all the urban bodies which were previously classified as Municipality were reclassified as Municipality even if their population was under 100,000. Under the [[Panchayati Raj]] system, it interacts directly with the state government, though it is administratively part of the district it is located in. Generally, smaller district cities and bigger towns have a Municipality. Municipality are also a form of local self-government entrusted with some duties and responsibilities, as enshrined in the [[Seventy-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India|Constitutional (74th Amendment) Act,1992]].
*In the [[Local government in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], the term was used until the [[1972 Local Government Act]] came into effect in 1974 in [[England]] and [[Wales]], and until 1975 in [[Scotland]] and 1976 in [[Northern Ireland]], "both for a city or town which is organized for self-government under a municipal corporation, and also for the governing body itself. Such a corporation in Great Britain consists of a head as a mayor or provost, and of superior members, as aldermen and councillors".&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Municipality]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since local government reorganisation, the unit in England, Northern Ireland and Wales is known as a ''district'', and in Scotland as a ''council area''. A ''district'' may be awarded ''borough'' or ''city'' status, or can retain its ''district'' title.
*In [[Jersey]], a municipality refers to the honorary officials elected to run each of the 12 [[Parishes of Jersey|parishes]] into which it is subdivided. This is the highest level of regional government in this jurisdiction.
* In [[Trinidad and Tobago]], "municipality" is usually understood as a city, town, or other local government unit, formed by municipal charter from the state as a municipal corporation. A town may be awarded borough status and later on may be upgraded to city status. [[Chaguanas]], [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]], [[Port of Spain]], [[Arima]] and [[Point Fortin]] are the 5 current municipalities in Trinidad and Tobago.
*In the [[United States]], "municipality" is usually understood as a city, town, village, or other local government unit, formed by municipal charter from the state as a municipal corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.findlaw.com/library/pa-municipal-law.html |title=Legal Dictionary: Municipal Law |publisher=[[FindLaw]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a state law context, some U.S. state codes define "municipality" more widely, from the state itself to any political subdivisions given jurisdiction over an area that may include multiple populated places and unpopulated places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.justia.com/codes/nevada/2009/title-3/chapter-43/43-080/ |title=2009 Nevada Code |publisher=Justia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_75/Article_11/75-1117.html |title=Kansas Statues |publisher=Lesterama}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Political divisions of the United States]].)

===Chinese-speaking===
*In the [[People's Republic of China]], a [[direct-controlled municipality]] (直辖市 in [[pinyin]]: zhíxiáshì) is a [[city]] with equal status to a [[Province (China)|province]]: [[Beijing Municipality|Beijing]], [[Tianjin Municipality|Tianjin]], [[Shanghai Municipality|Shanghai]], and [[Chongqing Municipality|Chongqing]] (see [[Municipality of China]]).
*In [[Republic of China|Taiwan (Republic of China)]], a special municipality (直轄市 in [[pinyin]]: [[Political divisions of Taiwan|zhíxiáshì]]) is a city with equal status to a province: [[Kaohsiung]], [[New Taipei]], [[Taichung]], [[Tainan]], [[Taipei]] and [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]] (see [[Special municipality of Taiwan]]).

*In Portuguese language usage, there are two words to distinguish the territory and the administrative organ. When referring to the territory, the word '''''[[concelho]]''''' is used, when referring to the [[Organs of state|organ of State]], the word '''''município''''' is used. This differentiation is in use in Portugal and some of its former overseas provinces, but it’s no longer in use in Brazil.

== The Niño Brothers and Columbus's first voyage ==
The four Niño brothers, [[Pedro Alonso Niño|Pedro Alonso]], [[Francisco Niño|Francisco]], [[Juan Niño|Juan]] and Bartolomé were already sailors with prestige and experience in [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] journeys before playing a distinguished part in Columbus's first voyage to the New World. Their friendship with [[the Pinzón Brothers]], and especially with the oldest of them, [[Martín Alonso Pinzón]], influenced their participation in Columbus's project.&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite web|author=Diputación de Huelva|url=http://www.diphuelva.es/inicial.aspx#aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXBodWVsdmEuZXMvd2ViL2NvbnRlbmlkb19iYXNpY28uYXNweD9pZENvbnRlbmlkbz00NTImaWRBcmVhPTUy|title=Los marineros de Huelva|accessdate=2009-08-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810101911/http://www.diphuelva.es/inicial.aspx#aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXBodWVsdmEuZXMvd2ViL2NvbnRlbmlkb19iYXNpY28uYXNweD9pZENvbnRlbmlkbz00NTImaWRBcmVhPTUy|archivedate=2009-08-10|df=}}

On Columbus's first voyage, Pedro Alonso Niño was pilot of the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'',&lt;ref name=Peralonso&gt;Alice Bache Gould, Nueva Lista Documentada De Los Tripulantes De Colon En 1492, ''Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia'', Tomo CLXX, Número II, 1973, ''passim.'', including p. 80. However, as noted on p. 293, some near-contemporaries place him as pilot of ''La Niña''.&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Niño was master of ''[[Niña|La Niña]]'', of which he was the owner,&lt;ref name="master of La Niña"&gt;Alice Bache Gould, Nueva Lista Documentada De Los Tripulantes De Colon En 1492, ''Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia'', Tomo CLXX, Número II, 1973, p. 50, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and Francisco Niño is believed to have been a sailor on ''La Niña''.&lt;ref name="2 Franciscos"&gt;Alice Bache Gould, Nueva Lista Documentada De Los Tripulantes De Colon En 1492, ''Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia'', Tomo CLXX, Número II, 1973, ''passim.'', p. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Niños took part as well in Columbus's [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Second voyage|second]] and [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third]] voyages. Between 1499 and 1501 they traveled on their own account, with the merchants Cristóbal and Luis Guerra, following the route of Columbus's third voyage to the [[Gulf of Paria]] on the [[South America]]n mainland in what is now [[Venezuela]].{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Pedro Alonso was named by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] chief pilot of the Ocean Sea (the Atlantic) as recompense for his services to the crown. He was also one of the teachers of Prince [[John, Prince of Asturias|John]], the ill-fated son of Ferdinand and Isabella, whom he taught the art of mapmaking.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==The Niño family==
Little of the following is known with absolute certainty, especially with respect to Columbus's first voyage. As discussed at length in [[Alice Bache Gould]]'s documented list of the participants in Columbus's first voyage, almost all of the information we have is assembled by cross-comparing numerous incomplete and sometimes mutually contradictory documents. For example, there is nothing explicit in the documents related to the expeditions to distinguish the two Francisco Niños, but certainly the pilot was not the cabin boy. It is imaginable that in some cases, where discrepancies are not so obvious, two people with the same name may have been conflated,&lt;ref&gt;Alice Bache Gould, Nueva Lista Documentada De Los Tripulantes De Colon En 1492, ''Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia'', Tomo CLXX, Número II, 1973, ''passim'', especially p. 43 on the issue in general and p. 49 and 58 on the Niños in particular. From p. 49, speaking of the first voyage: ''"&amp;hellip; a la familia Niño me doy por vencida. Los testigos no están de acuerdo, y difieren de tantas maneras, que a fin a puesto en el clase de 'dudosos' a todos los Niños, excepto a Juan, a Francisco, y a Pedro Alonso, aunque creo que fueron más."'' ("&amp;hellip; with respect to the Niño family, I give myself up as defeated. The witnesses are not in agreement, and the differ in so many manners, that in the end I have classified all of the Niños as 'dubious', except for Juan, Francisco, and Pedro Alonso, although I thin there were more [on the first voyage].")&lt;/ref&gt; especially because the first serious scholarly effort to create a comprehensive list of the voyagers dates from 1884, nearly four centuries after the fact.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Bache Gould, Nueva Lista Documentada De Los Tripulantes De Colon En 1492, ''Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia'', Tomo CLXX, Número II, 1973, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Even Juan Niño's ownership of ''La Niña'' is open to some doubts, though it is clear that he was master of the ship.&lt;ref name="master of La Niña" /&gt;

===The Niño Brothers===
* Juan Niño, the oldest of the brothers,&lt;ref&gt;Alice Bache Gould, Nueva Lista Documentada De Los Tripulantes De Colon En 1492, ''Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia'', Tomo CLXX, Número II, 1973, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; was master and owner of the [[caraval]] ''La Niña'' on Columbus's first voyage.&lt;ref name="master of La Niña" /&gt; Upon their return, he accompanied Columbus to [[Barcelona]]&lt;ref&gt;Alice Bache Gould, Nueva Lista Documentada De Los Tripulantes De Colon En 1492, ''Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia'', Tomo CLXX, Número II, 1973, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; after staying several days at home in Moguer. He was also on the crew of the second and third voyages of Columbus. With his brother Pedro Alonso he traveled to the Gulf of Paria.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}
* Pedro Alonso Niño was born in Moguer around 1468. A sailor since his youth, he learned his trade on the coast of  [[Africa]].{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} In 1492, on Columbus's first voyage, he was pilot of the ''Santa María''.&lt;ref name=Peralonso /&gt; In 1494 he traveled again with Columbus, but returned rapidly to Spain, as he was in [[Cádiz]] on 7 March 1494. Although he was enlisted for the third voyage, in the end he was not able to go. He was given the title of Grand Pilot of the Indies (''Piloto Mayor de las Indias'') the first such together with [[Juanoto Berardi]], and in 1495 and 1496 captained several ships to the New World.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} In 1499 he became associated with the merchants Guerra, with whom he made a sea voyage to the Gulf of Paria, where they obtained many [[pearl]]s, explored a good deal of the coast, variously trading with natives and battling them.&lt;ref&gt;David Marley, ''Wars of the Americas: a chronology of armed conflict in the New World, 1492 to the present'', ABC-CLIO, 1998, {{ISBN|0-87436-837-5}}, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1502, returning to Spain on the ''Santa María de la Antigua''.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} Contemporary records sometimes refer to him as Peralonso Niño.&lt;ref name=Peralonso /&gt;

The prohibition on '''''orlah''-fruit''' (lit. '''"uncircumcised" fruit''') is a command found in the Bible not to eat fruit produced by a tree during the first three years after planting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith R. Baskin]] ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Judaism and Jewish Culture'' p134-135 2011 "The biblical law of "uncircumcised" fruit (orlah) prohibits consuming fruit picked from a tree in the [[Land of Israel]] within three years of its planting (Lev 19:23). According to rabbinic interpretation of "fourth-year planting" (neta revai) ...may only be eaten in Jerusalem unless it is redeemed.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew word ''orlah'' literally means "uncircumcised". This meaning is often footnoted in English translations:
{{quotation|[[Leviticus]] 19:23 "When you enter the land and plant any kind of fruit tree, regard its fruit as forbidden.[a] For three years you are to consider it forbidden [b]; it must not be eaten. 24 In the fourth year all its fruit will be holy, an offering of praise to the LORD. 25 But in the fifth year you may eat its fruit. In this way your harvest will be increased. I am the LORD your God."
:Footnotes: [a][b] Hebrew "uncircumcised" [[NIV]]}}

In rabbinical writings the ''orlah''-prohibition ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: איסור ערלה) is counted as one of the negative commandments among the rabbinical enumeration of [[613 commandments]]. Outside Israel the prohibition applies to a certain degree.

== Bible ==
Commentators generally assume that the law was good agricultural practice, and that early harvesting would conflict with careful cultivation and pruning during the first three years in order to insure later good harvests and allow maturing of the trees.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ivp Bible Background Commentary: Genesis-Deuteronomy'' p163 [[John H. Walton]], [[Victor H. Matthews]] - 2000 "Careful cultivation and pruning was necessary during the first three years in order to insure eventual good harvests and proper maturing of the trees. The fruit during this period could not be eaten and was declared unclean (literally, 'uncircumcised.')&lt;/ref&gt; Grape vines produce fruit in three to six years, almond trees produce some flower buds in the fourth year and some fruit in the fifth, and sources from the [[Ancient Near East]] suggest that a good crop of dates was expected in the fourth year.&lt;ref&gt;''Trees, Earth, and Torah: A Tu B'Shvat Anthology'' p51  [[Ari Elon]], Naomi M. Hyman, Arthur Waskow - 2000 previously printed in ''The savage in Judaism: an anthropology of Israelite religion'' Howard Eilberg-Schwartz - 1990 "Grape seedlings produce fruit in three to six years, and almond trees produce some flower buds in the fourth year and some fruit in the fifth (Janick and Moore 1975, 138, 396). Ancient sources confirm that ancient fruit trees produced ...&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing the commandment that the fruit could not actually be eaten until the fifth year, Rooker (2000) notes that in the [[Code of Hammurabi]] a tenant-gardener could not eat of the fruit of an orchard until the fifth year, when he shared the produce with the owner.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus p260  Mark F. Rooker, Dennis R. Cole - 2000 "155 In the Code of Hammurabi #60 it was legislated that a gardener who was also a tenant could not eat of the fruit of his orchard until the fifth year, when he shared the produce with the owner."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp Code of Hammurabi, as translated by L. W. King, #60.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rabbinical writings==
=== Mishnah ===
The [[Mishna]] stipulates that Orlah fruit must be burnt to guarantee that no one benefits from them (Mishnah, Temurah 33b), and even a garment dyed by way of pigment derived from orlah is to be destroyed (Mishnah, Orlah 3:1).

=== Sifra ===
The [[Sifra]] (to Leviticus 19:24) points out that the three year count begins on [[Rosh HaShana]] (the Jewish new year) and not "tree years" (the Jewish agricultural holiday of [[Tu Bishvat]]). Thus, the fruit of a tree only two years and 30 days old may not be considered forbidden.

=== Jerusalem Talmud ===
The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] stipulates that "sofek orlah" (uncertainty if the product is indeed orlah) is permitted outside of the land of Israel ([[Orlah (Talmud)]] 20b).  However, [[Rabbi Yochanan]], in a letter sent to [[Rabbi Yehudah]] and quoted in the [[Babylonian Talmud]], took a starkly stringent approach to the common practice of diasporic Jewry being overly lenient on "safek orlah";

{{Quote|Conceal (a) safek (uncertain orlah), and destroy what is orlah for certain, and publicize on their produce that its burial is required.  And anybody who says that there is no (prohibition) of orlah outside the land of Israel will not (merit to have) either a great-grandchild or grandchild who cast property ownership in the lot of the congregation of [[Names_of_God_in_Judaism#HaShem|HaShem]]|Tractate Kiddushin 39b}}

=== Outside of the land of Israel ===
Although the mitzvah of orlah is listed in the category of prohibitions pertaining to the [[Laws and customs of the Land of Israel in Judaism|Land of Israel]] alone ("מצווה שתלויה בארץ ישראל"), it is the only mitzvah of this category that applies outside of Israel as well - with certain leniencies (mishna, Kidushin ch. 1, Mishna 9). This application is forthcoming due to it being listed as a "Halakhah LeMoshe MiSinai" (a [[law given to Moses at Sinai]], Sifra, 23:14). The [[tannaim|tanna]] [[Eliezer ben Hurcanus|Rabbi Eliezer ben Hurcanus]] holds the opinion that the prohibition of orlah does not apply outside the land of Israel at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tosefta]], Orlah,  ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Questionable fruit ===
Faced with an uncertainty as to whether an item is orlah (or a result of orlah usage such as dye, etc.), the mishna prescribes that such product is permitted for consumption so long as the actual removal of orlah product is not "seen" being picked (Mishnah, Orlah, ch. 3). 

The [[papaya]] fruit is a subject of intense rabbinic dispute. Some rabbinic authorities maintain that the papaya is not a tree, thus making it orlah-exempt,&lt;ref&gt;Rav Pe’alim responsa (Vol. 2, Orach Chayim #30), responsa Yechaveh Daath 4:52&lt;/ref&gt; whereas most rule that the laws of orlah do apply to the papaya.&lt;ref&gt;Shevat Halevi 6:165; Mishpetei Aretz, page 27, quoting Rav Elyashiv; Teshuvos VeHanhagos&lt;/ref&gt; [[Papain]], (a "second crop" enzyme extracted from the papaya peel, used in beer, biscuits, and as a digestive aid) is likewise under rabbinic scrutiny as a dilution ratio of 200:1 (200 non-orlah fruit to 1 part orlah) is required to permit orlah, essentially prohibiting benefiting from this enzyme.

=== Use of the term "uncircumcised" ===
The term "uncircumcised" is explained by [[Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz]] as meaning "hidden and sealed" and it alludes to the creation itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz]] Keli Yekar on Leviticus 19:23&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice in modern Israel==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10773">'''Pit and mounds''' are small, persistent microtopographical features that present themselves after a disturbance event occurs and uproots trees via [[windthrow]]. The uprooted tree falls, and a pit forms in the forest floor where the root mass and associated soil matrix used to be. Eventually after a period of time in which the roots decay, the associated soil matrix that was pulled out of the ground with the roots falls back to the ground, creating a corresponding mound.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Šamonil, P., Král, K., &amp; Hort, L. (2010). The role of tree uprooting in soil formation: A critical literature review. Geoderma, 157(3–4), 65-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of a pit==
A pit, as defined above, is formed when pressure is applied to the trunk and crown of the tree that is more powerful than the root and associated soil's ability to hold the tree upright and in place and knocks the tree down. This toppling of the tree can be caused by a multitude of different types of [[forest disturbance]]. Wind may blow the tree down; snow may accumulate and put excessive weight on the tree; the tree's roots may have decayed to a point where they are not strong enough to hold the tree upright. Soil conditions also play a role in the ability of the tree to remain upright. Wet soil can loosen the hold a tree's roots have on the soil, and dry soil can help hold the tree in place.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Embleton-Hamann, C. (2004). Processes responsible for the development of a pit and mound microrelief. Catena, 57(2), 175-188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of a mound==
A mound, as defined above, is formed on average from five to ten years after the formation of a pit. The root mass must decay to an extent where the soil matrix that was suspended with it when it toppled over can slough off on to the ground near the corresponding pit. The necessity of the decay of the root mass is what causes this lag time. In more cold or dry climates, the rate of decay is slower and this time lag may be extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clinton|first=Barton D|last2=Baker|first2=Corey R|date=2000|title=Catastrophic windthrow in the southern Appalachians: characteristics of pits and mounds and initial vegetation responses|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1127(99)00082-1|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=126|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.1016/s0378-1127(99)00082-1|issn=0378-1127|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Disturbances==

===Disturbance scale===

Pit and mounds always occur on a fine spatial scale, being the result of only one tree felling. Commonly they are a product of [[windthrow]], but they can also be caused by other factors. Large amounts of snow accumulation on tree boughs or  extensive root decay are other possible causes for tree uprooting. Pit and mounds have been analyzed on both on a small scale and larger scale forest systems. It has been observed that they can act as important soil disruptors and microsites for biodiversity and plant establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ulanova|first=Nina G|date=2000|title=The effects of windthrow on forests at different spatial scales: a review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112700003078|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=135|issue=1–3|pages=155–167|doi=10.1016/s0378-1127(00)00307-8|issn=0378-1127|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microclimatic conditions===
It has been observed that pit and mounds on an individual basis generally have specific climatic and pedological characteristics. 
Mounds are generally observed to be warmer and drier than the forest floor or the corresponding pit; Similarly, the pit is generally found to be colder and have a higher soil moisture content than either the forest floor or the mound. One notable instance where there is an exception to the general observation is when a snow layer has fallen. The pit becomes insulated by the snow layer and then in some instances is observed to be warmer than the mound.

Mounds receive the highest amount of [[photosynthetically active radiation]] (PAR) and pits the lowest amount. Pits also have much higher amounts of leaf litter than mounds, who have high tendencies to erode.

===Nutrient content and plant establishment===
Studies on pit and mounds generally have at least five sampling sites per each pit and mound sampled. These areas, generally, are the top of the mound, bottom of the pit, side of the mound, edge of the pit, and an undisturbed forest floor area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kabrick|first=J.M.|last2=Meyers|first2=N.L.|last3=McSweeney|first3=K.|date=1997|title=Comparison of sampling methods for estimating pit and mound microtopography|url=http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US1997066445|journal=Soil Science Society of America (USA)|language=English|volume=61|pages=1423–27|issn=0361-5995|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies have observed that both pits and mounds generally have lower carbon and nitrogen soil content than the undisturbed forest floor, although they have carbon to nitrogen ratios that are not significantly different from the ratios observed on the forest floor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Liechty, H. O., Jurgensen, M. F., Mroz, G. D., Gale, M. R., Liechty, H. O., Jurgensen, M. F., et al. (1997). Pit and mound topography and its influence on storage of carbon, nitrogen, and organic matter within an [[old-growth forest]]. Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 27(12), 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mounds are observed to be generally more nutrient poor and fewer plants establish on them in comparison to pits for several reasons. Mounds tend to erode and thus are more unstable than the forest floor or the pit. The surface of the mound also contains very little organic matter because it is mainly soil that was uprooted from the mineral horizons of the soil layer. This coupled with the observation that seed deposition rates are lower for mounds than pits, makes plant establishment on mounds unlikely and problematic for the plant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Conversely, many studies have found that species richness and overall number of established plants is found to be statistically higher on mounds than in pits. It was experimentally determined that the leaf litter accumulation that occurs within a pit has a large effect on the lack of species diversity or establishment that occurs there. In fact, when scientists removed the leaf litter and monitored the species establishment within the pit, it was found that the diversity and number began to resemble that that occurred on mounds. Multiple studies have found that on the forest floor a high or dense amount of leaf litter or dead organic matter corresponds to a low amount of species diversity as well.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Peterson, C. J., &amp; Campbell, J. E. (1993). Microsite differences and temporal change in plant communities of treefall pits and mounds in an old-growth forest. Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, 120(4), 451-460.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biodiversity==

===Macrofauna===
Little information is available on how macrofauna are affected by the presence of pit and mounds in a forested landscape. One would believe they would benefit from the presence of [[coarse woody debris]] as habitat and new flora that establish in the pit and mounds, but there is a lack of published evidence.

One [[macrofauna]] species that has received attention is the [[earthworm]] population in a lowland [[temperate rainforest]] of [[Belgium]]. It was observed that both earthworm speciation and biomass differed based on location within the pit and mound microsites examined. Undisturbed sites near the pit and mounds had the highest amount of species diversity and biomass compared to either a pit or a mound. The undisturbed sites contained species of earthworm that were not present in either the pit or mound sample site. An explanation towards why there were less earthworms present in the pit or mound was that within the mound there was more dry, mineralized soil present and less organic matter due the uprooting of the tree. The pits examined were found to generally only contain one species of earthworm that was known to inhabit very moist soils. It was concluded that the pit microhabitat was too humid and water containing for most other species of earthworm.

==Knowledge gaps==
What aspects of pit and mounds can be generalized and what effects they exert of the dynamism of the forest can be generalized is a currently evolving narrative. As more scientific literature crops up from around the world, it becomes more apparent what aspects of the pit and mounds occur in most any biome they are found in. As it is, there is not enough scientific data to allow much extrapolation from forest to forest in regard to pit and mound knowledge.

===Location of experimentation and data collection===
It should be noted that virtually all of the scientific knowledge about pit and mounds and their impact on forest heterogeneity and other dynamics comes from the Northern Hemisphere, particularly the Relic forests of Europe and  the [[Temperate rainforests of Eastern Canada]] and [[Southeast Alaska]]. It can be argued that because pit and mounds occur on such a small scale, they may impact forest in the southern hemisphere in a different way. Until information is collected, it will be unknown.

===Herbivory===
Studies of pit and mound on a large time scale may be affected by the presence of herbivores in the area. A herbivore may preferentially browse certain seedlings that grow on either a pit or a mound and will mask any other variables that might be contributing to why those seedlings are establishing in a pit or mound by skewing the final counts of the growing plants.
&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Microbiological communities===

One would assume that on a microbial level a disturbance that results in a pit and mound event would lead to a greater heterogeneity on the microbial level as multiple soil horizons are uplifted and mixed. However, little scientific data exists on the microbial population and its changes due to a pit and mound creation.

===Impact on silviculture===

There is no scientific data on the effects, if any, of either the synthetic  or natural creation of pit and mounds in a managed forest and the effects it has on the growth or health of the forest.

The '''pollution haven hypothesis''' posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this often comes at the cost of environmentally unsound practices. [[Developing country|Developing nations]] with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

==Three scales of the hypothesis==
#[[Pollution control]] costs have an impact at the margins, where they exert some effect on investment decisions and trade flows.
#Pollution control costs are important enough to measurably influence trade and investment.
#Countries set their environmental standards below socially-efficient levels in order to attract investment or to promote their exports.&lt;ref name="Four New Empirical Tests of the PHH"&gt;{{cite web|last=Millimet|first=Daniel|title=Four New Empirical Tests of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis When Environmental Regulation is Endogenous|url=http://econ.tulane.edu/seminars/Millimet.pdf|publisher=Tulane University|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scales 1 and 2 have empirical support, but the significance of the hypothesis relative to other investment and trade factors is still controversial.  One study found that environmental regulations have a strong negative effect on a country's [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]], particularly in pollution-intensive industries when measured by employment.  However, that same study found that the environmental regulations present in a country's neighbors have an insignificant impact on that country's trade flows.&lt;ref name="Four New Empirical Tests of the PHH" /&gt;

==Formula and variations==
:Yi = αRi + XiβI + εi

In the above formula, Y is economic activity, R is regulatory stringency, X is an aggregate of other characteristics that affect Y and ε is an [[error term]].&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; Theoretically, by changing your value of R, analysts will be able to calculate the expected effect on economic activity. According to the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, this equation shows that environmental regulations and economic activity are negatively correlated, because regulations raise the cost of key inputs to goods with pollution-intensive productions and reduce jurisdictions' comparative advantage in these goods. This lack of comparative advantage causes firms to move to countries with lower environmental standards, decreasing Y.

There is also an expanded formula, as shown below:

:Yit = vi + αRit + γTit + θRitTit + X’βit + εit

This expanded formula takes into account whether [[trade liberalization]] (i.e. the level of [[trade barrier]]s that exist in a country, labeled as T) increases the negative correlation between economic activity (Y) and regulatory stringency (R).  Some authors claim that trade barriers disproportionately effect the environment, and this equation attempts to quantify the interaction between trade barriers and regulatory stringency, and the corresponding effect with respect to output in an economy.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt;

== Connection with the environmental Kuznets curve ==
[[File:Environmntal Kuznets Curve.png|thumb|A simple recreation of the Environmental Kuznets Curve, made using Microsoft Excel.]]
{{see also|Kuznets curve}}

The '''environmental Kuznets curve''' (EKC) is a conceptual model that suggests that a country's pollution concentrations rise with development and industrialization up to a turning point, after which they fall again as the country uses its increased affluence to reduce pollution concentrations, suggesting that the cleaner environment in developed countries comes at the expense of a dirtier environment in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Exploring the Causality between the Pollution Haven Hypothesis and the Environmental Kuznets Curve"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ibara|first=Brian|title=Exploring the Causality between the Pollution Haven Hypothesis and the Environmental Kuznets Curve|url=http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/econ_honproj/21|work=Honors projects|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the EKC is potentially a reflection of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, because one of the factors that may drive the increase in [[environmental degradation]] seen in [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial economies]] is an [[global waste trade|influx of waste from post-industrial economies]].  This same transfer of polluting firms through trade and foreign investment could lead to the decrease in environmental degradation seen in downward-sloping section of the EKC, which models post-industrial (service) economies. This model holds true in cases of national development, but cannot necessarily be applied at a local scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Human-Environment Geography|last=Moseley, Perramond, Hapke, Laris|first=William G., Eric, Holly M., Paul|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4051-8932-3|location=Oxford, UK|pages=179-180|quote=|via=Open edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real-world example==
Spent batteries that [[United States|Americans]] turn in to be recycled are increasingly being sent to [[Mexico]], where the lead inside them is extracted by crude methods that are illegal in the United States.  This increased export flow is a result of strict new [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] standards on lead pollution, which make domestic recycling more difficult and expensive in the United States, but do not prohibit companies from exporting the work and danger to countries where environmental standards are low and enforcement is lax.  In this sense, Mexico is becoming a pollution haven for the United States battery industry because Mexican environmental officials acknowledge that they lack the money, manpower, and technical capacity to police the flow.  According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2011, 20% of spent American vehicle and industrial batteries were being exported to Mexico, up from 6% in 2007, meaning that approximately 20 million batteries would cross the border that year.  A significant proportion of this flow was being smuggled in after being mislabeled as metal scrap.&lt;ref name="NY Times Lead Export Article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenthal|first=Elizabeth|title=Lead from Old US Batteries Sent to Mexico Raises Risks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/science/earth/recycled-battery-lead-puts-mexicans-in-danger.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=14 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:E-waste dump site GDP per capita.png|thumb|Map of GDP PPP per-capita with known e-waste dump sites added in 2013.]]
The world map shown here illustrates how e-waste dump sites (or sites where citizens or multinational corporations of industrialized nations dump their used electronic devices) along with the [[Purchasing power parity|GDP PPP per-capita]] of those countries.&lt;ref name="e-waste dump locations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Where does e-waste end up?|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/where-does-e-waste-end-up/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Used EEE &amp; E-Waste Import and E-Waste Generated in Kyoto Protocol Non-Annex I Countries.png|thumb|Shows an estimated amount of Used EEE and E-Waste imported into [[Kyoto Protocol]] Non-Annex 1 countries, with the E-Waste generated by each country's own domestic supplies.]] While GDP PPP per-capita is not a perfect indicator of economic development, and e-waste dump sites are only one small facet of what could be a greater pollution haven, this map does illustrate how e-waste dump sites are often located in poorer, relatively pre-industrial nations, which provides some rudimentary support for the Pollution Haven Hypothesis.

==Areas of controversy ==
The first area of controversy with respect to the Pollution Haven Theory has to do with the formulas above.  Finding an appropriate measure of regulatory stringency (R) is not simple, because we want to know how much more costly production is in a given jurisdiction relative to others due to that jurisdiction's environmental regulations.  The compliance costs stemming from these regulations, however, could come in the form of environmental taxes, regulatory delays, the threat or execution of lawsuits, product redesign, or emissions limits.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; This proliferation of cost styles makes R hard to quantify.

Another major critique of the second formula is that it is difficult to measure regulatory stringency and trade barriers because the two effects are likely endogenous, so few studies have attempted to estimate the indirect effect of trade liberalization on pollution havens.  Furthermore, governments at times engage in inefficient competition to actually attract polluting industries through weakening their environmental standards.  However, as per conventional economic theory, welfare-maximizing governments should set standards so that the benefits justify the costs at the margin.  This does not mean that environmental standards will be equal everywhere, as jurisdictions have different assimilative capacities, costs of abatement, and social attitudes regarding the environment, meaning heterogeneity in pollution standards is to be expected.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; By extension, this means that industry migration to less stringent jurisdictions may not raise [[efficiency]] concerns in an economic sense.

A final area of controversy is whether the Pollution Haven Hypothesis has empirical support.  For example, studies have found [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] evidence that countries with poor air quality do have higher net factor exports of coal, but the magnitude of the impact is small relative to other variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kellogg|first=Ryan|title=The Pollution Haven Hypothesis: Significance and Insignificance|year=2006|publisher=Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, UC Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Krugman]], a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]–winning economist, is skeptical as to whether pollution havens have empirical support in economic theory, as he writes, "At this point it's hard to come up with major examples of industries in which the pollution haven phenomenon, to the extent that it occurs, leads to international negative externalities. This does not, however, say that such examples cannot arise in the future."&lt;ref name="International Economics Theory &amp; Policy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=International Economics Theory and Policy|year=2006|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=9780321451347}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scale 3 above has had empirical arguments made specifically against it, especially in the last 20 years.  Some economists argue that once higher environmental standards are introduced in a country, larger multinational firms present in the country are likely to push for enforcement so as to reduce the cost advantage of smaller local firms.  This effect would make countries with strict environmental standards a haven for the large companies often associated with higher levels of pollution, meaning the polluting agents may be smaller companies, rather than the larger MNCs as theorized by other proponents of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Where Are The Pollution Havens?"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birdsall|first=Nancy|author2=Wheeler, David|title=Trade Policy and Industrial Pollution in Latin America: Where Are the Pollution Havens?|journal=The Journal of Environment &amp; Development|date=January 1993|volume=2|issue=1|pages=137–149|doi=10.1177/107049659300200107|url=http://jed.sagepub.com/content/2/1/137.full.pdf+html|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Punjab''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Punjab.ogg|p|ʌ|n|ˈ|dʒ|ɑː|b}}, {{IPAc-en|-|ˈ|dʒ|æ|b}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʌ|n|dʒ|ɑː|b}}, {{IPAc-en|-|dʒ|æ|b}}), also spelled '''Panjab''' (''land of "five rivers"'';&lt;ref name=EoS/&gt; [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: {{lang|pnb|{{Nastaliq|پنجاب}}}} &lt;small&gt; ([[Shahmukhi]])''';''' &lt;/small&gt; {{lang|pa|ਪੰਜਾਬ}} &lt;small&gt;([[Gurumukhi]])&lt;/small&gt;; {{lang-el|Πενταποταμία}}, ''Pentapotamia''), is a geopolitical, cultural and historical region in [[South Asia]], specifically in the northern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]], comprising areas of eastern [[Pakistan]] and [[northern India]]. The boundaries of the region are ill-defined and focus on historical accounts.

Until the [[Partition of Punjab]] in 1947, the British [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]] encompassed the present-day [[States and union territories of India|Indian states]] of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], Haryana, [[Himachal Pradesh]], Chandigarh, and Delhi, and the [[Administrative units of Pakistan|Pakistani provinces]] of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Islamabad Capital Territory]]. It bordered the [[Balochistan]] and [[Pashtunistan]] regions to the west, [[Kashmir]] to the north, the [[Hindi Belt]] to the east, and [[Rajasthan]] and [[Sindh]] to the south.

The people of the Punjab today are called [[Punjabis]], and their principal language is [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. The main religions of the Punjab region are [[Islam]], [[Sikhism]], and [[Hinduism]]. Other religious groups are [[Christianity]], [[Jainism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Ravidassia]]. The Punjab region has been inhabited by the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley Civilisation]], [[Indo-Aryan peoples]], and [[Indo-Scythians]], and has seen numerous invasions by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|Greeks]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], [[Pashtuns]], [[British Raj|British]], and others. Historic foreign invasions mainly targeted the most productive central region of the Punjab known as the [[Majha]] region,&lt;ref&gt;Jatiinder Aulakh. Archaeological History of Majha: Research Book about Archaeology and Mythology with Rare Photograph. Createspace Independent Pub, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; which is also the bedrock of [[Punjabi culture]] and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Arrain, Anabasis, V.22, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political geography==
There are two main definitions of the Punjab region: the 1947 definition and the older 1846–1849 definition. A third definition incorporates both the 1947 and the older definitions but also includes northern Rajasthan on a linguistic basis and ancient river movements.
 
===1947 definition===
The 1947 definition defines the Punjab region with reference to the dissolution of [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] whereby the then British [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]] was [[Partition of India|partitioned]] between India and Pakistan. In Pakistan, the region now includes the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab province]] and [[Islamabad Capital Territory]]. In India, it includes the [[Punjab, India|Punjab state]], Chandigarh, [[Haryana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k2Ual-NgAVMC&amp;pg=PT85&amp;dq=haryana%20punjab%20ties&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv1bLxqubNAhXBA8AKHdPpDNA4ChDoAQhLMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=haryana%20punjab%20ties&amp;f=false|title=Pratiyogita Darpan|first=Pratiyogita|last=Darpan|date=1 October 2009|publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920032209/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k2Ual-NgAVMC&amp;pg=PT85&amp;dq=haryana%20punjab%20ties&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv1bLxqubNAhXBA8AKHdPpDNA4ChDoAQhLMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=haryana%20punjab%20ties&amp;f=false|archivedate=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Himachal Pradesh]].

Using the 1947 definition, the Punjab borders the [[Balochistan]] and [[Pashtunistan]] regions to the west, [[Kashmir]] to the north, the [[Hindi Belt]] to the east, and [[Rajasthan]] and [[Sindh]] to the south. Accordingly, the Punjab region is very diverse and stretches from the hills of the [[Kangra Valley]] to the [[Punjab Plain|plains]] and to the [[Cholistan Desert]].

Using the 1947 definition of the Punjab region, some of the major cities of the area include [[Lahore]], [[Faisalabad]] and [[Ludhiana]].

===Older 1846–1849 definition===

The older definition of the Punjab region focuses on the collapse of the Sikh Empire and the creation of the British Punjab province between 1846 and 1849. According to this definition, the Punjab region incorporates, in Pakistan, [[Azad Kashmir]] including [[Bhimber]] and [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]]&lt;ref&gt;History of Panjab Hill States, Hutchison, Vogel 1933 Mirpur was made a part of Jammu and Kashmir in 1846&lt;/ref&gt; and parts of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] (especially [[Peshawar]]&lt;ref&gt;Changes in the Socio-economic Structures in Rural North-West Pakistan By Mohammad Asif Khan [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nKdraLI-c0wC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=peshawar+separated+from+punjab+1901&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PBoCu9_Nb7&amp;sig=e2q7sw1Jrtq-W2KNVpP71lTH-5k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oafUVNHTF4OU7AaquIDoDQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=peshawar%20separated%20from%20punjab%201901&amp;f=false] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414225511/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nKdraLI-c0wC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=peshawar%20separated%20from%20punjab%201901&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PBoCu9_Nb7&amp;sig=e2q7sw1Jrtq-W2KNVpP71lTH-5k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oafUVNHTF4OU7AaquIDoDQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw |date=14 April 2016 }} Peshawar was separated from Punjab Province in 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; known in the Punjab region as Pishore).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=EzWcVaDDCYmZ7AbwrreABA&amp;id=9_1tAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=peshawar+known+as+pishore&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+pishore |last=Nadiem |first=Ihsan H. |year=2007 |title=Peshawar: heritage, history, monuments |publisher=Sang-e-Meel Publications |accessdate=13 September 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016025110/https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=EzWcVaDDCYmZ7AbwrreABA&amp;id=9_1tAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=peshawar+known+as+pishore&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+pishore |archivedate=16 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In India the wider definition includes parts of Delhi and [[Jammu Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Jammu-and-Kashmir|title=Jammu and Kashmir|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310222040/http://www.britannica.com/place/Jammu-and-Kashmir|archivedate=10 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=TMxJzb7N_8wC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Epilogue, Vol 4, Issue 11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204021635/https://books.google.ca/books?id=TMxJzb7N_8wC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|archivedate=4 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pritam Singh Gill |date=1978 |title=History of Sikh nation: foundation, assassination, resurrection |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8CVuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=History+of+Sikh+nation:+foundation,+assassination,+resurrection.&amp;dq=History+of+Sikh+nation:+foundation,+assassination,+resurrection.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZiOiMmb_eAhWHso8KHecFCJYQ6AEIJzAA |location=[[University of Michigan]] |publisher= New Academic Pub.

Using the older definition of the Punjab region, the Punjab region covers a large territory and can be divided into five natural areas:&lt;ref name=EoS/&gt;
* the eastern mountainous region including [[Jammu and Kashmir|Jammu Division]] and [[Azad Kashmir]];
* the trans-Indus region including [[Peshawar]];
* the central plain with its five rivers;
* the north-western region, separated from the central plain by the [[Salt Range]] between the Jhelum and the Indus rivers;
* the semi-desert to the south of the [[Sutlej river]].

The formation of the [[Himalayas|Himalayan Range]] of mountains to the east and north-east of the Punjab is the result of a collision between the north-moving [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The plates are still moving together, and the Himalayas are rising by about {{convert|5|mm|1}} per year.

The upper regions are snow-covered the whole year. Lower ranges of hills run parallel to the mountains. The [[Lower Himalayan Range]] runs from north of [[Rawalpindi]] through [[Jammu and Kashmir]], Himachal Pradesh and further south. The mountains are relatively young, and are eroding rapidly. The Indus and the five rivers of the Punjab have their sources in the mountain range and carry loam, minerals and silt down to the rich alluvial plains, which consequently are very fertile.&lt;ref name=Gosal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal_11_1/3_gosal.pdf |title=Physical Geography of the Punjab |author=G.

==Climate==
[[File:Himalayas, Punjab region.png|thumb|The snow-covered Himalayas]]The climate is a factor contributing to the economy of the Punjab. It is not uniform over the whole region, with the sections adjacent to the Himalayas receiving heavier rainfall than those at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;Maps of India, [http://www.mapsofindia.com/punjab/geography-and-history/climate.html Climate of Punjab] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030101212/http://www.mapsofindia.com/punjab/geography-and-history/climate.html |date=30 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main seasons and two transitional periods. During the [[hot season]], from about mid April to the end of June, the temperature may reach {{convert|49|C}}. The [[monsoon season]], from July to September, is a period of heavy rainfall, providing water for crops in addition to the supply from canals and irrigation systems. The transitional period after the monsoon is cool and mild, leading to the winter season, when the temperature in January falls to {{convert|5|C}} at night and {{convert|12|C}} by day. During the transitional period from winter to the hot season, sudden hailstorms and heavy showers may occur, causing damage to crops.&lt;ref name=rgs&gt;Royal Geographical Society [http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/5F44251D-8FD1-4102-BCDB-240A4E9EA1B8/0/F3ClimateandLandscapeFactsheet.pdf Climate and Landscape of the Punjab] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430034607/http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/5F44251D-8FD1-4102-BCDB-240A4E9EA1B8/0/F3ClimateandLandscapeFactsheet.pdf |date=30 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of the Punjab}}
[[File:Taxila Pakistan juillet 2004.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Taxila]] in Pakistan is a [[World Heritage Site]]]]
The Punjab region of India and Pakistan has a historical and cultural link to Indo-Aryan peoples as well as partially to various indigenous communities. As a result of several invasions from Central Asia and the Middle East, many ethnic groups and religions make up the cultural heritage of the Punjab.

In prehistoric times, one of the earliest known cultures of South Asia, the Indus Valley civilisation was located in the region.

The epic battles described in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' are described as being fought in what is now the [[State of Haryana]] and historic Punjab. The [[Gandhara]]s, [[Kambojas]], Trigartas, Andhra, Pauravas, Bahlikas (Bactrian settlers of the Punjab), Yaudheyas and others sided with the [[Kauravas]] in the great battle fought at [[Kurukshetra]].&lt;ref&gt;Buddha Parkash, ''Evolution of Heroic Tradition in Ancient Panjab'', p 36.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr{{nbsp}}Fauja Singh and Dr{{nbsp}}L.{{nbsp}}M. Joshi: "There is no doubt that the Kambojas, Daradas, Kaikayas, Andhra, Pauravas, Yaudheyas, Malavas, Saindhavas and Kurus had jointly contributed to the heroic tradition and composite culture of ancient Punjab".&lt;ref&gt;''History of Panjab'', Vol{{nbsp}}I, p.{{nbsp}}4, Dr L.{{nbsp}}M. Joshi, Dr Fauja Singh.&lt;/ref&gt;

His armies entered the region via the [[Hindu Kush]] in northwest Pakistan and his rule extended up to the city of [[Sagala]] (present-day [[Sialkot]] in northeast Pakistan). In 305{{nbsp}}BCE the area was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. In a long line of succeeding rulers of the area, [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and [[Ashoka]] stand out as the most renowned. The Maurya presence in the area was then consolidated in the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] in 180{{nbsp}}BCE.

In 711–713 CE, the 18-year-old Arab general [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] of [[Taif]], a city in what is now [[Saudi Arabia]], came by way of the Arabian Sea with Arab troops to defeat [[Raja Dahir]]. Bin{{nbsp}}Qasim then led his troops to conquer the Sindh and Punjab regions for the Islamic [[Umayyad Caliphate]], making him the first to bring Islam to the region.
 
[[File:July 9 2005 - The Lahore Fort-Pavillion adjacent to the Shish Mahal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A section of the Lahore Fort built by the Mughal emperor [[Akbar]]]]
During the establishment and consolidation of the Muslim Turkic [[Mughal Empire]] prosperity, growth, and relative peace were established, particularly under the reign of [[Jahangir]]. Muslim empires ruled the Punjab for approximately 1,000 years. The period was also notable for the emergence of [[Guru Nanak]] (1469–1539), the founder of [[Sikhism]].

In 1758, Punjab came under the rule of [[Marathas]], who captured the region by defeating the Afghan forces of [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]]. Abdali's Indian invasion weakened the Maratha influence, but he could not defeat the [[Sikhs]]. After the death of Ahmad Shah, the Punjab was freed from the Afghan yoke by Sikhs between 1773 and 1818. At the time of the formation of the [[Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)|Dal Khalsa]] in 1748 at [[Amritsar]], the Punjab had been divided into 36 areas and 12 separate Sikh principalities, called [[misl]]. From this point onward, the beginnings of a Punjabi [[Sikh Empire]] emerged. Out of the 36 areas, 22 were united by [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]. The other 14 accepted British [[sovereignty]]. After Ranjit Singh's death, assassinations and internal divisions severely weakened the empire. Six years later the British [[East India Company]] was given an excuse to declare war, and in 1849, after two [[Anglo-Sikh wars]], the Punjab was annexed by the British.

In the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] the Sikh rulers backed the East India Company, providing troops and support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sikhspectrum.com/2004/08/the-truth-about-the-indian-mutiny-of-1857/ |title=The Truth about the Indian Mutiny |last1=Ganda Singh |date=August 2004 |publisher=Sikh Spectrum |accessdate=13 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520155424/https://sikhspectrum.com/2004/08/the-truth-about-the-indian-mutiny-of-1857/ |archivedate=20 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in [[Jhelum]] 35 British soldiers of HM{{nbsp}}XXIV regiment were killed by the local resistance, and in [[Ludhiana]] a rebellion was crushed with the assistance of the Punjab chiefs of [[Nabha]] and [[Malerkotla]].

The [[British India|British Raj]] had political, cultural, philosophical, and literary consequences in the Punjab, including the establishment of a new system of education. During the independence movement, many Punjabis played a significant role, including [[Madan Lal Dhingra]], [[Sukhdev Thapar]], [[Sardar Ajit Singh|Ajit Singh Sandhu]], [[Bhagat Singh]], [[Udham Singh]], [[Kartar Singh Sarabha]], [[Bhai Parmanand]], [[Muhammad Iqbal]], [[Chaudhary Rehmat Ali]], and [[Lala Lajpat Rai]].

At the time of partition in 1947, the province was split into East and West Punjab. East Punjab (48%) became part of India, while West Punjab (52%) became part of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pakgeotagging.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/partition-of-punjab-in-1947.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 February 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208221714/http://pakgeotagging.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/partition-of-punjab-in-1947.html |archivedate=8 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}.

[[File:Major ethnic groups of Pakistan in 1980 borders removed.jpg|thumb|Ethnic [[Punjabis]] in Pakistan]]

===Ethnic background===
Ethnic ancestries of modern Punjabis include a mixture of Indo-Aryan and [[Indo-Scythian]]. Semitic ancestries can also be found in lesser numbers. With the advent of [[Islam]], settlers from [[Turkestan]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Kashmir]] have also integrated into the Muslim Punjabi society. However, the majority of Punjab is still made up of the [[Arain]]s, [[Dalit]]s, [[Gujjar]]s, [[Jat]]s, [[Khatri]]s, [[Tarkhan (Punjab)|Tarkhans]], [[Brahmin]]s, [[Bhatra|Bhats]], [[Awan (tribe)|Awan]]s, [[Kamboj]]s, [[Rajput]]s [[Saini]]s, [[Kumhar]]s, and others.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In the past, the most densely populated area has been the [[Majha]] region of Punjab. 

===Languages===
[[File:Dialects Of Punjabi.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Dialects of Punjabi]] {{main|Punjabi language}}The major language spoken in the Punjab is Punjabi.  In the Indian Punjab this is written in the [[Gurmukhi]] script. Pakistan uses the [[Shahmukhi]] script, that is closer to [[Urdu]] script. Hindi, written in the [[Devanagri]] script, is used widely in the Indian states of Himanchal Pradesh and Haryana. Several dialects of Punjabi are spoken in the different regions.  The [[Majhi dialect]] is considered to be textbook Punjabi and is shared by both countries.

===Religions===
The vast majority of Pakistani Punjabis are [[Sunni Muslim]] by faith, but also include large minority faiths mostly [[Shia Muslim]], [[Ahmadi Muslim]] and Christians.

The Indian states of [[Haryana]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]] are mostly Hindu-majority. [[Sikhism]], founded in the late 15th{{nbsp}}century, is the main religion practised in the post-1966 Indian [[Punjab, India|Punjab state]]. About 57.7% of the population of Punjab state is Sikh, 38.5% is [[Hindu]], and the rest are Muslims, Christians, and [[Jainism|Jains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_data_finder/C_Series/Population_by_religious_communities.htm| title=Census Reference Tables, C-Series Population by religious communities| publisher=Census of India| year=2001| accessdate=25 July 2010| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701214405/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_data_finder/C_Series/Population_by_religious_communities.htm| archivedate=1 July 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punjab state contains the holy [[Sikh]] cities of [[Amritsar]], [[Anandpur Sahib]], [[Tarn Taran Sahib]], [[Fatehgarh Sahib]] and [[Chamkaur Sahib]].

{{main|Economy of Punjab, Pakistan|Economy of Punjab, India}}

The historical region of Punjab is considered to be one of the most fertile regions on Earth. Both east and west Punjab produce a relatively high proportion of India and Pakistan's food output respectively.

The region has been used for extensive wheat farming, in addition rice, cotton, [[sugarcane]], fruit, and vegetables are also grown.

The agricultural output of the Punjab region in Pakistan contributes significantly to Pakistan's GDP. Both Indian and Pakistani Punjab are considered to have the best infrastructure of their respective countries. Indian Punjab has been estimated to be the second richest state in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-04-08/chandigarh/28336153_1_northern-states-capita-income-total-software-exports "Punjab second richest state in country: CII"], ''The Times of India'', 8 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistani Punjab produces 68% of Pakistan's food grain production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infopak.gov.pk/punjab.aspx Pakistani government statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308122328/http://www.infopak.gov.pk/punjab.aspx |date=8 March 2007 }}. Retrieved 14 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Its share of Pakistan's GDP has historically ranged from 51.8% to 54.7%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spdc.org.pk/Data/Publication/PDF/WP5.pdf Provincial Accounts of Pakistan: Methodology and Estimates 1973–2000] {{date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Called "The Granary of India" or "The Bread Basket of India", Indian Punjab produces 1% of the world's rice, 2% of its wheat, and 2% of its cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agropedia.iitk.ac.in/content/punjab-leader-agricultural-sector |title=Punjab |last1=Yadav |first1=Kiran |date=11 February 2013 |publisher=Agropedia |accessdate=15 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306042334/http://agropedia.iitk.ac.in/content/punjab-leader-agricultural-sector |archivedate=6 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, it was recorded that farmers made up 39% of Indian Punjab's workforce.

[[File:Chennai suburban rail and bus interconnectivity map.png|thumb|300px|A railway map of the Chennai suburban train system including proposed new lines]]
[[Chennai]], the capital city of the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]], and the headquarters of the [[Southern Railway Zone]], is a major rail transport hub in the country. It has over 40 railway stations which are part of an extensive suburban railway network&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sr.indianrailways.gov.in/&lt;/ref&gt;The city is served by three railway terminals - the [[Chennai Central railway station]] and the [[Chennai Egmore railway station]] and the [[Tambaram railway station]].

The first railway station to be built in Chennai is the [[Royapuram railway station|Royapuram station]] constructed in 1855 though the city had a railway line that dates back to the 1840s. 

Fundamentally, Chennai has 4 suburban railway lines,&lt;ref name="CMRL pdf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Brief of Chennai Metro Rail |url=http://chennaimetrorail.gov.in/pdf/project_brief_updated_aug08.pdf |work=CMRL |publisher=Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) |accessdate=24 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H4ij99qY?url=http://chennaimetrorail.gov.in/pdf/project_brief_updated_aug08.pdf |archivedate= 2 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; namely [[North Line, Chennai Suburban|North line]], [[West Line, Chennai Suburban|West line]], [[South Line, Chennai Suburban|South line]] and [[Chennai MRTS|MRTS line]]. The [[South West Line, Chennai Suburban|South West line]], [[West North Line, Chennai Suburban|West North line]] and [[West South Line, Chennai Suburban|West South line]] are merely minor extensions or modifications of the aforementioned suburban lines. The MRTS is a suburban railway line that chiefly runs on an elevated track exclusively used for running local EMUs or suburban local trains. No express trains or passenger trains run on MRTS line.

The '''Red Belt''' or '''Red Zone''' ({{lang-ru|Красный пояс}}) was a group of [[Russia]]n regions with a stable support for the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] and other left parties in [[Elections in Russia|local and federal elections]]. The term came into wide use from the mid-1990s after Communist candidates won a number of regions from non-Communist opposition candidates. The "red zone" comprised predominantly [[agriculture|agricultural]] areas of [[Central Russia]], the [[Republics of Russia|national republics]] of the [[North Caucasus]], as well as a number of the southern regions of [[Siberia]] and the [[Russian Far East|Far East]]. With the coming to power of [[Vladimir Putin]] (31 December 1999) and reduced support for the Communist Party, the "red belt" ceased to exist.

==Reasons==
In 1999, the regions of the "red zone", according to the analyst Rostislav Turovsky, included the [[Smolensk]], [[Bryansk]], [[Kaluga]], [[Oryol|Orel]], [[Kursk]], [[Belgorod]], [[Ryazan]], [[Lipetsk]], [[Tambov]], [[Voronezh]], [[Penza]], [[Ulyanovsk]], [[Saratov]], [[Volgograd]] and [[Astrakhan]] regions. They have a high proportion of rural population with the appropriate mentality{{clarify|date=November 2014}} of inherent conservatism. However, with the economic development of different regions, they are not among the most depressed. Turov noted strong support for the Communist Party in the North Caucasus (except in [[Ingushetia]]). In the territories and regions of the North Caucasus, a predominantly Russian population of this area support Communist candidates, in his opinion, due to the same reasons as in the rest of the "red zone". In the national republics ([[Karachay-Cherkessia]], [[Dagestan]] and [[North Ossetia]]) support is due to [[Nostalgia for the Soviet Union|nostalgia for the Soviet era]], when these poor areas experienced ethno-political and socio-economic stability. In [[the Urals]], and to the east of them, Turovskii notes strong pro-communist sentiment in regions such as [[Orenburg]], [[Kurgan, Kurgan Oblast|Kurgan]], [[Omsk]], [[Novosibirsk]], [[Chita Oblast]] and [[Altai Krai]], as well as in agricultural areas and in districts of mostly Russian national composition (the [[Altai Republic]], the [[Ust-Orda Buryat Autonomous Okrug|Ust-Orda Buryat AO]] and the [[Jewish Autonomous Okrug|Jewish AO]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} According to political scientist Alexander Kanev, "in fact the so-called red zone of the 1990s was no more than a residual support for the former communist government. As soon as the new government is "well established" and returned to the familiar (Soviet) rhetoric and behavior, it has become an electoral power base inherit the previous."{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

'''Territorial changes of the Baltic states''' refers to the redrawing of borders of [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] after 1940. The three republics, formerly autonomous regions within the former [[Russian Empire]] and before that of former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], gained independence in the aftermath of [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. After a two-front independence war fought against both [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]]n and Baltic German nationalist forces, the countries concluded peace and border treaties with Soviet Russia in 1920. However, with [[World War II]] and the occupation and annexation of these republics into the Soviet Union twenty years after their independence, certain territorial changes were made in favour of the [[Russian SFSR]]. This has been the source of political tensions after they regained their independence with the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]]. Some of the disputes remain unresolved.

The main issues are the territories which were part of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the [[interwar period]], but which became incorporated into the [[Russian SFSR]], [[Byelorussian SSR]] and [[Poland]] after [[World War II]]. In addition, some territories that were not controlled by the independent Baltic republics were also annexed during the Soviet era. Most notable case is [[Vilnius]] taken from Poland by the [[USSR]] to become the capital of Lithuania.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union the issue of these territories was raised by the Estonian and Latvian governments.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Lithuania has never officially raised the question of its borders and has border treaties with all its neighbors. Only marginal political groups use the "issue of borders" in their political rhetoric.

== Actual territorial changes after World War II ==
This is a list of actual territorial changes that happened when Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were incorporated into the Soviet Union and became the Baltic Soviet Socialist Republics. All the boundaries established by these changes exist up to modern days (now they are delimiting the boundaries of independent Baltic states). The modern [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] or [[Polish language|Polish]] official names of locations mentioned in this section are given in the first place, while, where applicable, the official interwar names (Lithuanian, Latvian or Estonian) are given in parenthesis.

[[File:Baltic states borders.jpg|thumb|300px|Border changes of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] after [[World War II]]]]
In January 1945, some territories of [[Estonian SSR]] were ceded to the [[Russian SFSR]]: the Russian–Estonian boundary in the north of [[Lake Peipus]] was moved westwards by about 12 kilometers from its interwar location (which was delimited by the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]]); the new boundary (which exists up until these days) runs along [[Narva river]]. The Russian-Estonian boundary that used to run in the middle of [[Lake Peipus]] did not change, while the boundary south of [[Lake Peipus]] was also moved westwards (by about 25 kilometers). Overall, about 2000&amp;nbsp;km² of land changed hands, including [[Ivangorod]] (''Jaanilinn'', then eastern suburb of [[Narva]]), the town of [[Pechory]] (''Petseri''), and areas in and around [[Izborsk]] (''Irboska''), [[Lavry]] (''Laura''), and [[Rotovo]] (''Roodva''), and the [[Kolpina Island]] (''Kulkna'') in southern [[Lake Peipus]].

=== Latvia ===
In the late 1944, a territory in northeastern [[Latvian SSR]] of about 1,300 square kilometers was ceded to [[Russian SFSR]]. This area includes towns of [[Pytalovo]] (until 1938 ''Jaunlatgale'', since 1938 – ''Abrene'') and four rural districts. All these areas during the interwar constituted the eastern part of the [[Abrene County]] of [[Latvia]]. They were added to [[Pskov Oblast]] of [[Russian SFSR]]. Russian-Latvian boundary in the southeastern Latvia did not change.

=== Lithuania ===
[[File:Lithuania territory 1939-1940.svg|thumb|250px|Border changes of [[Lithuania]] around [[World War II]]]]
After the annexation of [[Lithuania]] into the [[Soviet Union]] in 1940, a new eastern boundary of Lithuania ([[Lithuanian SSR]]) was delimited. The boundary which was delimited in 1920 by [[Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty]] had not been the eastern and southern boundary of Lithuania during most of the period because the [[Vilnius region]] became part of [[Poland]] in early 1920s. Lithuania, however, continued to claim the 1920 border as official and the Soviets continued to recognise these areas as part of [[Lithuania]] rather than [[Poland]] as well. In 1940, when Lithuania was incorporated into the Soviet Union, a new boundary was drawn, enlarging the ''de facto'' Lithuanian territory, though not to the full extent of the republic's claim. The notable gain was the city of [[Vilnius]], which again became Lithuania's capital. The control of the [[Vilnius region]] was partitioned between the Lithuanian SSR (including towns of [[Švenčionys]], [[Druskininkai]] and the village of [[Dieveniškės]]), the [[Belarusian SSR]] and [[Nazi Germany]] (the latter territory was returned to Poland after [[World War II]]).  Main cities that were recognised by Soviets as a part of Lithuania by the 1920 treaty but were not added to [[Lithuanian SSR]] include [[Hrodna]] (''Gardinas''), [[Lida]] (''Lyda''), [[Smarhon]] (''Smurgainys''), [[Pastavy]] (''Pastovys''), [[Ašmiany]] (''Ašmena''), [[Brasłaŭ]] (''Breslauja''), [[Suwałki]] (''Suvalkai'').

==Reasons for the territorial changes==
Theoretically, the redistribution of lands after World War II was based on the ethnicity of local populations — some of the territories that had a clear non-Baltic majority were attached to other republics; this, however, also happened to some territories which had a clear [[Baltic people|Baltic majority]] (many of them were enclaves in areas without a Baltic majority). In Latvia and Estonia, territories which had not belonged to  the [[Governorate of Estonia]], the [[Riga Governorate]], [[Vitebsk Governorate]] or the [[Courland Governorate]] within the [[Russian Empire]] were detached. Unlike Soviet Socialist Republics, however, imperial gubernyas were not based on ethnicity, so this historical reasoning is not accepted by Latvians and Estonians. In Lithuania's case, the detaching did not have any historical foundation.

== History of the territories after resumption of independence ==
Under the Soviet rule the territories that were added to the [[Russian SFSR]] and the [[Byelorussian SSR]] were largely [[Russification|Russified]], due to insufficient support for Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian languages, characterized by too few schools with curricula in these languages {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. They saw a significant migration of Russian-speaking people. In some of the territories that became part of [[Poland]], Lithuanian language schools existed and still exist.&lt;ref name="lt_embassy"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.lietuva.pl/index.php?language=pl&amp;page=178 Społeczność litewska w Polsce] (Lithuanian community in Poland) on the official site of Lithuanian embassy in Poland&lt;/ref&gt;

The territories were not returned to the Baltic states after they gained independence and remain parts of [[Russia]], [[Belarus]] and [[Poland]]. In general, the official government policy of Latvia and Estonia is not to push the issue, but the territories' return is supported by some, usually marginal, organizations inside these countries, such as the [[Abrenian Union]] in Latvia.

=== Estonia ===
{{main|Territorial issues between Estonia and Russia}}
The [[Estonia-Russia border]] treaty had been signed in Moscow on 18 May 2005 and ratified by Estonia, but was not ratified by Russia&amp;nbsp;— official reason for this was the fact that Estonia's internal treaty [[ratification]] legislation passed by parliament mentioned the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|1920 Treaty of Tartu]] (the treaty under which these territories were originally recognised as Estonian).

On 6 September 2005, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned [[Anne Härmaste]], Chargé d'Affaires ''ad interim'' of Estonia in Russia, and handed her a note containing a notice of the intention of the Russian Federation to withdraw its signature and not to become a party to the Treaty Between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Estonia on the Russian-Estonian State Border and to the Treaty Between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Estonia on the Delimitation of the Sea Areas in the [[Narva Estuary]] and Gulf of Finland.

The Treaty of Tartu is considered to be a historical document of no legal power by Russia, while in Estonia the situation is different, as officially Estonia is considers itself the continuation state of the [[interwar]] Estonia.

=== Latvia ===
It was assumed that the Russian-Latvian border treaty would be signed in year 2005. In [[Latvia]] the opposition, primarily the organization Abrenian Union (consisting of people deported from [[Pytalovo]] and surroundings, sometimes referred to as the Association of Abrene Residents), lobbied for nationwide referendum on such treaty as they saw it as violating the constitution of Latvia (principle of territorial unity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusnet.nl/news/2005/04/15/currentaffairs03.shtml article about this]&lt;/ref&gt; The government ruled out a possibility of referendum, however the negotiations for border treaty were suspended by Russia after the Latvian parliament issued a declaration stating that Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union and claiming material compensation from Russia for the period of occupation.

President [[Vladimir Putin]] in his speech regarding these territories said that "it goes against the spirit of modern [[Europe]]" to raise issues like this one, that "Russia as well has lost many of its external territories during the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]], such as the [[Crimea]]".{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} In an interview with [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] in May 2005, Putin addressed the issue of [[Pytalovo]], when he stated that Russia would not hold any negotiations with Latvia which involved territorial losses for Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.kremlin.ru/text/appears/2005/05/88557.shtml|script-title=ru:Стенографический отчет о встрече с творческим коллективом газеты "Комсомольская правда"|date=23 May 2005|publisher=[[Presidential Press and Information Office]]|accessdate=2 September 2011|location=[[Moscow]]|language=ru|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403014931/http://archive.kremlin.ru/text/appears/2005/05/88557.shtml|archivedate=3 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/23515/40181/|script-title=ru:В "Комсомолку" приехал Путин|last=Sedov|first=Andrey|author2=Kaftan, Larisa |author3=Gamov, Alexander |author4= Baranov, Andrey |date=23 May 2005|publisher=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]|accessdate=2 September 2011|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lithuania ===
Lithuania immediately after independence recognised the borders established in 1940 as the borders of Lithuania and signed border agreements with [[Belarus]] and [[Poland]].

The '''Association of British Columbia Land Surveyors (ABCLS)''' is a self-governing, non-profit, [[non-governmental organization]] which sets educational requirements, examines for admission, and regulates professional [[surveying|land surveyors]] within [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. The ABCLS is responsible for developing [[by-laws|bylaws]] and guidelines for the conduct of its members, establishing and administering entry requirements for the profession, and liaising with governmental bodies and other [[professional associations|associations]] to improve the quality of the profession's service to the public.&lt;ref name="Civic Info BC. Association of BC Land Surveyors"&gt;[http://www.civicinfo.bc.ca/ubcm/ViewSupplier.asp?supplierid=483&amp;find=a Civic Info BC. "Association of BC Land Surveyors." Accessed June 21, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Its mission statement is: ''The Association of British Columbia Land Surveyors protects the public interest and the integrity of the survey systems in British Columbia by regulating and governing the practice of land surveying in the province.''&lt;ref name="ABCLS Mission"&gt;[http://www.abcls.ca/?page_id=11554 ABCLS Website. "ABCLS Mission."  Accessed May 25, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABCLS is governed by the ''Land Surveyors Act'', a Provincial [[statute]] which sets out the framework within which the Association and its members operate.&lt;ref name="Land Surveyors Act"&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96248_01 Canada. British Columbia. Land Surveyors Act. &amp;#91;Victoria BC&amp;#93;, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;
The ABCLS is headquartered in [[Sidney, British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="ABCLS Webpage"&gt;[http://www.abcls.ca ABCLS Webpage. "Contact Us." Accessed May 25, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abcls.ca/?page_id=42&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The profession of land surveying was not regulated in British Columbia until the late 1800s.&lt;ref name="Whittaker, John A. 1990"&gt;Whittaker, John A. ''Early Land Surveyors of British Columbia.'' Victoria: The Corporation of Land Surveyors of British Columbia. 1990. {{ISBN|1-55056-090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1891, the provincial government recognized a cadre of professional Surveyors - many of whom had been [[Royal Engineers]]&lt;ref name="Whittaker, John A. 1990"/&gt; 
In 1890, the Association of Provincial Land Surveyors was launched during a two-day long meeting held in Victoria and attended by 22 surveyors.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;Gordon, K. ''Made to Measure''. BC: Sono Nis Press. 2006. {{ISBN|1550560905}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1891, the Provincial Land Surveyors' Act was proclaimed by the [[Executive Council of British Columbia|British Columbia Government]] in response to a petition made to the government by the Association, in which they requested, "(...) the introduction of an act to protect authorized surveyors in the performance of their duties, to prevent unqualified persons acting as surveyors and to provide for duly qualified persons from time to time being admitted to practice." &lt;ref&gt;Thomson, D.W. ''Men and Meridians'' Vol. 2. Ottawa: Department of Energy, Mines and Resources. 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Framed by W.S. Gore, then the Provincial Surveyor General, the  Act established a Board of Examiners (made up of the Surveyor General and five other surveyors) and set down policies for [[Articled clerk|articling pupils]].  Thereafter, only surveyors who passed the examinations and subsequently were approved by the Board were allowed to practice in the province of British Columbia. Authorized surveyors were then called "Provincial Land Surveyors of the Province of British Columbia"; they received a numbered commission and seal, and were entitled to append the initials "PLS" after their names. The PLS group of surveyors eventually numbered eighty-five members.&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt;  The Act also incorporated a governing body - the Association of Provincial Land Surveyors - for their profession. However, the Association was relatively weak, and in 1905 it was replaced by the Corporation of Land Surveyors of the Province of British Columbia.  The Corporation was established under new [[legislation]], the Provincial Land Surveyors' Act (1905), which strengthened the management of the profession.&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt;   A new Board of Examiners was formed and, as before, only surveyors who were recognized by that Board were entitled to practice in the province. Those so recognized were designated by the initials "BCLS" being appended to their name. Existing PLSs and LSs were also permitted to continue practicing under a [[grandfather clause]]. Although the Provincial Surveyors' Act has since been amended, the Association of British Columbia Land Surveyors now numbers over nine hundred and forty BCLS Commissions and continues to be the governing body of the profession. In order to practice legal land surveying in British Columbia, one must be a commissioned BCLS in good standing.&lt;ref name="Land Surveyors Act"/&gt;

==Becoming a BC Land Surveyor==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:ABCLS draw the line.jpeg|right|thumb]]  --&gt;
There are three streams by which individuals can be registered as a Land Surveyor in Training and work towards obtaining a commission as a BC land surveyor:

#Obtaining a Certificate of Completion from the Canadian Board of Examiners for Professional Surveyors (CBEPS).
#Obtaining a degree in geomatics engineering from the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT).
#Being a foreign trained professional with a minimum of two years experience as a cadastral land surveyor in their home country.&lt;ref name="ABCLS Becoming a Land Surveyor"&gt;[http://www.abcls.ca/?page_id=4382 ABCLS Webpage. "Becoming a Land Surveyor." Accessed June 21, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Certificate of Completion===
The Canadian Board of Examiners for Professional Surveyors (CBEPS) has accredited the following geomatics programs which can lead to one registering as a Land Surveyor in Training:

#[[University of Calgary]]
#[[University of New Brunswick]]

Individuals who have not graduated from the above programs but have other relevant academic and professional experience or may have been educated in foreign countries may apply to the CBEPS for a Certificate of Completion (C of C) and/or exemptions from required examinations.  
Additionally, graduates from programs other than geomatics engineering may apply to the CBEPS to have their credentials reviewed for exemptions from required examinations.
Once the CBEPS is satisfied that candidates have satisfied the mandatory academic requirements and have passed (or have been exempted from) necessary examinations, they issue the candidate a C of C. Candidates working through their CBEPS requirements or attending an educational institution in geomatics engineering may register as a survey student with the ABCLS.&lt;ref name="Candidate Application"&gt;[https://www.cbeps-cceag.ca/candidate-application CBEPS. "Candidate Application." Accessed June 21, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degree in Geomatics Engineering from BCIT===
A graduate from the geomatics degree program at BCIT with the required grade in the required courses may apply for entry as a Land Surveyor in Training.&lt;ref name="Geomatics"&gt;[https://www.bcit.ca/study/programs/geomatics BCIT. "Geomatics Engineering. " Accessed May 30, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign Trained Professionals===
Foreign trained professionals may apply for direct entry as a Land Surveyor in Training when they have two years of experience working in their home country.  Applications must include academic qualifications, an internationally accredited standards agency credential evaluation and transcript analysis certificate and proof of two years experience in cadastral land surveying in their home country.&lt;ref name="Candidate Application"/&gt;

===Land Surveyors in Training===
Once a candidate completes one of the three streams above, they are able to register with the ABCLS as a land surveyor in training (LST) and begin an articling period which typically lasts 18–32 months. This takes place under the supervision of a master who is a registered BC land surveyor. 
During the articling period, the candidate will write a series of professional examinations and complete three field projects. The examinations are intended to demonstrate that the candidate has a strong knowledge of every aspect of professional land surveying. These include statutes, regulations, practice of land surveying, the General Survey Instruction Rules, and the Surveyor General Circular Letters as they relate to each component of their education. The three field projects are intended to demonstrate the candidates’ practical skills including field measurements, evidence evaluation, boundary resolution, interaction with clients, and project management. Professional examinations and field projects are intended to test the candidates’ required theoretical knowledge and practical skills required to succeed as a land surveyor.&lt;ref name="ABCLS Exam Information"&gt;[http://www.abcls.ca/?page_id=268 ABCLS Webpage. "Exam Information."  Accessed May 30, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completion of the articling period and professional examinations, the candidate must sit a Professional Assessment Interview (PAI), which is [[Adjudication|adjudicated]] by members of the Board of Management. This interview covers a broad range of topics related to land surveying and is designed to evaluate the candidates’ qualifications, knowledge, manner, and professionalism. Candidates who successfully complete the PAI are able to obtain a commission as a BC land surveyor.&lt;ref name="Professional Assessment Interview"&gt;[http://www.abcls.ca/?page_id=456 ABCLS Webpage. "Professional Assessment Interview." Accessed May 30, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveyors from other Canadian jurisdictions who are in good standing with their home association do not need to register as survey students, but do have to fulfill requirements which depend on each candidate's individual license history with their home association.&lt;ref name="Career Entry"&gt;[http://www.abcls.ca/?page_id=35 ABCLS Webpage. "Career Entry." Accessed May 30, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership in the Association is restricted to those who hold a BCLS commission and registered students in the pursuit of such accreditation.  ABCLS Membership levels are:&lt;ref name="ABCLS General Info"&gt;[http://www.abcls.ca/?page_id=309 ABCLS Webpage. "General Info." Accessed May 30, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Practising''' – members authorized to conduct surveys within the Province of British Columbia
*'''Nonpractising''' – members currently not authorized to conduct surveys

==Board of Management==

The [[Board of directors|Board of Management]] (the Board) is authorized under the Land Surveyors Act, which identifies the Board's responsibilities and functions.&lt;ref name="Land Surveyors Act"/&gt;

The Board and Executive Officers are elected according to the ABCLS [[by-laws]]. A Vice President is elected annually for a two-year term. During the second year of their term they serve as President. In keeping with unofficial tradition since 1929, the outgoing President presents the incoming President with a pair of [[spats (footwear)|Spats]].&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt;   In addition to the President and Vice President, the Board consists of four elected members and four appointees; the Past President, a Lieutenant Governor in Council (an  appointed member of the public), the Surveyor General of BC, and a member appointed to serve as Secretary.  Elected members serve two-year terms and may run for additional terms or run for the position of Vice President.&lt;ref name="Board of Management"&gt;[http://www.abcls.ca/?page_id=9700 ABCLS Webpage.

[[File:Land Survey (14000483127).jpg|right|thumb|Land Survey (14000483127)]]

===Cadastral===

''Cadastral'' comes from the French word which refers to the register of lands. The "cadastral fabric" of B.C. refers to property boundaries, survey monuments, legal documents, maps, and regulations which are required to make the system work. [[Cadastre|Cadastral]] legal surveys involve the measurement, placement, title descriptions and/or re-establishment of legal boundaries on land (at, above, or below the surface), water, and air space. This scope of work includes [[lease]]s, mineral claims, and the determination of any approved physical right of tenure, occupation, and title. Many BCLSs are also consulted in matters such as land use applications, approvals, and re-[[zoning]]s.&lt;ref name="Cadastral Surveying"&gt;[http://www.aols.org/branches-geomatics/cadastral-surveying Association of Ontario Land Surveyors. "Cadastral Surveying." Accessed June 1, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topographical Survey===
A [[topography|topographical]] survey plan shows ground features, [[elevation]]s, and [[Boundary (topology)|contours]]. These plans may also show cultural details such as buildings, fences, roads, and [[groundcover|ground cover]]. Topographical plans are used in the design of [[Subdivision (land)|subdivisions]], roads, and for residential planning purposes.&lt;ref name="Topographical Survey"&gt;[http://www.adobeinc.com/faq/what-topographic-survey-and-when-it-needed Adobe Associates Inc. "Topographical Survey." Accessed June 1, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control Surveys===

Control surveys can be carried out to inform the following: determination of scales for photogrammetric mapping, establishment of precise [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]] based on a universal mapping system, establishment of sites for hydrographic charts, mine construction, or the routing of highways and transmission lines. [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) technology increases the effectiveness of control surveying.

===Building Location Certificates===
Surveys for the purpose of providing a certificate of building location on a particular parcel of land may be undertaken by a BCLS. These surveys are normally carried out for the protection of an owner, and are generally accepted as proof that there are no encroachment or [[zoning]] placement problems.&lt;ref name="Location Certificates"&gt;[http://www.bcsurveyors.ca/building-location-certificate/ Axis Land Surveying. "Location Certificates." Accessed June 1, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site Planning, Subdivision Design, and Consulting===

A BCLS is qualified to carry out [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]] design and all matters of parcel division in accordance with local, provincial and/or regional zoning and development by-laws.&lt;ref name="Land Surveyors Act"/&gt;

===Survey and Property Law===
BCLSs can provide [[expert witness]] [[testimony]] in matters of [[lawsuit|litigation]], where survey or boundary determinations are in question. The BCLS and a land surveying firm authorized to practice under permit must assume full responsibility for the correctness, validity, and accuracy of their own surveys including [[raw data]] and [[fieldnotes|field notes]] collected.&lt;ref name="Land Surveyors"&gt;[https://www.saskcareers.ca/occupation/2301/Land%20Surveyor/about-the-job Sask Careers. "Land Surveyors."  Accessed June 1, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advanced Geomatics===

Many BC land surveyors also have skills, expertise and experience in advanced [[geomatics]] and survey applications.  This can include precise surveys for machine alignment and deformation analysis, mapping and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) expertise, remote sensing, real-time GPS (Global Positioning System) surveys, mapping, and hydrographic surveys.&lt;ref name="Geomatics"/&gt;

==Practice Advisory Department==

The Practice Advisory Department (PAD) is a division of the ABCLS which exists to promote the professional competency of land surveyors, which in turn protects the public interest. The protection of the public interest is of the utmost importance to the ABCLS, as framed in the Association's Mission Statement (see above). The PAD strives to monitor the competence level of the ABCLS membership while considering the expectations of the public, government, and ABCLS members. The PAD aims to ensure that all land surveys completed in British Columbia meet a high quality of standards, and that the overall integrity of the province's cadastre is maintained. In order to achieve these goals, the PAD initiated the Practice Review Program, which consists of two primary activities: an Annual Plan Review and a Practice Review.

The Annual Plan Review sees the yearly review of at least one completed survey plan by all practising BCLSs. This approach provides the valuable functions of:
*monitoring the performance of all practising BCLSs who produce statute plans
*monitoring and understanding trends in performance issues common to the profession
*producing performance statistics useful for evaluating member performance
*providing a venue for dialogue with members to clarify issues

The Practice Review component of the PAD is a means of addressing any shortcomings in practitioner's work, focusing on members who require assistance, education, or mentoring. Newly commissioned BCLSs are also subject to Practice Reviews with the aim of establishing an individual baseline and ensuring that their practice has the essential elements of a sustainable professional practice.&lt;ref name="ABCLS Bylaws"&gt;[http://www.abcls.ca/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/2016_Bylaws_Approved_16-03-04.pdf ABCLS Webpage.

Thomas Thane McVittie was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] on May 5, 1858. He moved to British Columbia in 1879 and opened a land surveying office in Galbraith's Ferry in 1881. The town was renamed [[Fort Steele]] in 1888.&lt;ref name="Fort Steele"&gt;[http://fortsteele.ca/our-story/history/ Fort Steele Heritage Town. "History." Accessed June 23, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; McVittie became a well-known local British Columbia Land Surveyor in the East Kootenay region from 1881 to 1918. He was responsible not only for the surveying of the Fort Steele [[townsite]], but for numerous other [[East Kootenay|Regional District of East Kootenay]] townsites and mineral claims as well. In addition to his land surveying duties, McVittie was a [[churchwarden|church warden]], [[Board of education|school trustee]], townsite agent, [[Justice of the Peace]], secretary of the Fort Steele Mining Association, and president of the liberal-conservative club.  McVittie renovated the one room cabin that he had built to make a home for his bride who would be joining him from New York. Renovations were completed by early November 1899, and McVittie and Anna Galbraith were married in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] in late December of that year. Anna Galbraith was the niece of Fort Steele's most prominent citizen and McVittie's good friend [[Robert Leslie Thomas Galbraith|Robert Galbraith]].&lt;ref name="McVittie House"&gt;[http://www.cranbrooktownsman.com/ourtown/315872261.html "McVittie House, Land Surveying Office open at Fort Steele."

=== Restoration project ===
In 1993, ABCLS entered into a partnership with Fort Steele Heritage Town to move the historic home and land surveying office of Thomas Thane McVittie to the Heritage Town site across [[British Columbia Highway 93]]-[[British Columbia Highway 95|95]]. The project was made possible through the joint financial cooperation of the Association of BC Land Surveyors, Fort Steele Heritage Town, Friends of Fort Steele, and the [[Teck Resources|Teck Corporation]]. Hundreds of hours of restoration efforts by Association members and interested volunteers resulted in several improvements and updates being carried out on the structures. A grand opening ceremony was held on July 11, 2015.&lt;ref name="McVittie House"/&gt;

'''Vikingen Island''' is a small island  in the western part of [[Rødøy]] municipality  in [[Nordland]], [[Norway]].  Vikingen is situated  north of the village of [[Tonnes, Norway|Tonnes]]. The island is notable for having the [[Arctic Circle]] pass through it, something that is marked by a small statue with a globe.
