[[Image:Duelweaver.jpg|right|350px|thumb|[[Dennis Weaver]] starred in a famous ''ABC Movie of the Week'', [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'', which premiered in Canada November 10, 1971, was telecast in the United States three days later and had a theatrical release in Europe in early 1973. It eventually had an American theatrical release on April 22, 1983.]]

The '''''ABC Movie of the Week''''' was a weekly television [[anthology series]] featuring [[television film|made-for-TV movies]], that aired on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network in various permutations from [[1969 in television|1969]] to [[1975 in television|1975]].

==History==
In the 1960s, [[Film studio|movie studios]] viewed television as a second-rate medium but also as a threat to their theatrical revenue, so they charged high fees for the privilege to broadcast their films. The networks experimented with having films made specifically for TV to lower expenses. NBC created the first weekly umbrella for such films with their ''World Premiere Movie'' in 1966, running in a two-hour time slot.

Until the late 1960s, ABC ran a distant third behind rivals [[CBS]] and [[NBC]], leading to jokes about its acronym meaning "Almost Broadcasting Company" or coming in fourth among the three networks. Desperation and a looser corporate structure allowed ABC to consider plans that the other two networks would not. [[Barry Diller]], then a junior executive at ABC and later a co-founder of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network, is often cited as the creator of the ''Movie of the Week (MotW),'' but the concept was actually originated by producer [[Roy Huggins]]. Huggins reasoned that many older theatrical films ran shorter than 90 minutes so requiring a 120-minute time slot was unnecessary. His proposal was rejected by all three networks but became the subject of a cover story in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine. ABC's interest was renewed but they lacked confidence that Huggins could produce an entire season of telefilms by himself. As the ''Variety'' article had effectively placed the concept into the [[public domain]], ABC continued to develop it without Huggins' permission or involvement. They approached [[Universal Pictures|Universal]], which demanded a larger budget than ABC wanted to spend, as well as the exclusive right to produce all future TV movies for ABC, conditions that pushed ABC to control production on their own, assigning them to various studios and production companies. ABC consoled Huggins by allowing him to produce several films, including ''The Young Country,'' precursor to ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]].''

The shorter format allowed a smaller budget than previous two-hour films ($350,000 per film compared with NBC's $400,000 ''World Premiere'').&lt;ref&gt;p.xxii McKenna, Michael '' The ABC Movie of the Week: Big Movies for the Small Screen'' Scarecrow Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It featured the work of producers like [[Aaron Spelling]] and [[David Wolper]] (both of whom later developed hit series of their own), and was produced by different production companies such as [[Bing Crosby#Television|Bing Crosby Productions]], [[Spelling-Goldberg Productions]], Thomas-Spelling Productions (partly owned by [[Danny Thomas]]) and the network's own [[List of production companies owned by the American Broadcasting Company|ABC Circle Films]].

The ''MotW'' provided ABC with a ratings hit and, along with ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', helped establish the network as a legitimate competitor to rivals [[CBS]] and [[NBC]]. The films themselves varied in quality and were often escapist or sensationalistic in nature ([[thriller (genre)|suspense]], [[horror film|horror]] and [[melodrama]] were staples), but some were critically well received. For example, ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'' (1971), based on a [[Richard Matheson]] short story from ''[[Playboy]]'', was director [[Steven Spielberg]]'s first feature film, catapulting his career and enabling him to move from television to theatrical films.

ABC earned four [[Emmys]], a [[Peabody Award]] and citations from the [[NAACP]] and [[American Cancer Society]] for an airing of ''[[Brian's Song]]'' in 1972. The 1971-72 season of the series finished as the fifth highest rated series of the year.

The series was documented by Michael Karol in his 2005 book, ''The ABC Movie of the Week Companion,'' which was updated in 2008 ({{ISBN|1-60528-023-2}}), and by Michael McKenna in ''The ABC Movie of the Week: Big Movies for the Small Screen''.

==Time slots==
[[Image:Movieofbook.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The cover shows the Zuni fetish doll from ''[[Trilogy of Terror]]''.]]
The ''MotW'' originally aired on Tuesday nights at 8:30 pm [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern]]/7:30 pm [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central]]. Established series ''[[The Mod Squad]]'' acted as a lead-in from 7:30 to 8:30, bringing the younger [[Demography|demographic]]. The shorter running time of the film freed the 10 p.m. time slot for a full 60-minute program, initially ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'' during the first season. Starting earlier at 8:30 could also prevent viewers from switching to competing movies at 9:00. Beginning with the 1971 season, ABC added a second ''MotW'' on Saturday night and adjusted the titles of the shows to the ''Movie of the Week'' and ''Movie of the Weekend''. The following season, the Saturday installment was moved to Wednesday night, and the titles were adjusted to ''Tuesday Movie of the Week'' and ''Wednesday Movie of the Week''.

During the 1973-74 season, ABC added another movie on Saturday nights to their schedule, this time titled the ''ABC Suspense Movie'', and usually consisting of thriller, mystery and horror type films (some of which were reruns of movies which had originally aired as ''Movies of the Week'').

==Title sequence==
The [[title sequence]] was designed by [http://www.zoominfo.com/#!search/profile/person?personId=12367793&amp;targetid=profile Harry Marks]&lt;ref name="titles"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tvparty.com/vaultmov2.html|title = The ABC Movie of the Week Opening by Harry Marks|work = TVparty|accessdate = 2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and animated by [[Douglas Trumbull]] using the [[slit-scan]] process that he had created for ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.

The accompanying theme music was an orchestral version of "Nikki", a song composed by [[Burt Bacharach]] and named for his daughter.  The theme was arranged and performed by [[Harry Betts]].&lt;ref name="titles" /&gt;

Over the music was narration voiced by [[Dick Tufeld]] {{Citation needed|reason=No reputable sources say Tufeld, only blogs and comments.|date=July 2017}}. "The Movie of the Week. Presenting the world premiere of an original motion picture produced especially for ABC (or 'for the Movie of the Week' in some seasons)." That would be followed by a promotional teaser for the movie.

The opening for the Saturday ''Movie of the Weekend'' featured footage of a [[silhouette]]d "rotating [[Cinematographer|cameraman]]" operating a [[35 mm]] [[movie camera]] ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cckf1FHG-c]).  This footage would later be incorporated into the opening of ABC's [[New York City]] [[television station]] [[WABC-TV]]'s various movie umbrellas beginning around 1972-73, including and especially their weekday afternoon movie showcase ''[[The 4:30 Movie]]''.

==TV series pilots==
The series was often used as a platform to show [[television pilot|pilots]] for possible series for the network. It allowed the network to air pilots that it had already commissioned and paid for but had not ordered as regular series. As well, pilots that had already been sold as ongoing series or were being tested such as ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'', ''[[Longstreet (TV series)|Longstreet]]'', ''[[Toma (TV series)|Toma]]'', ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'' and ''[[Get Christie Love!]]'' premiered here and returned on the regular schedule after minor to major alterations to premise and/or cast. Other programs are sometimes mistakenly believed to have aired under the ''Movie of the Week'' banner. ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'' is believed to be a ''MotW'' but actually premiered after ''Seven in Darkness'' and was the lead-out for the Tuesday installment. Still others like ''[[Earth II]]'' and ([[Robert Conrad]]'s version of) [[Nick Carter (literary character)|''Nick Carter'']] did air during that era, but were actually on other nights under different banners - the ''ABC Sunday Night Movie'' in the case of ''Nick Carter'' and ''Earth II''.

== Actors ==
Most of the actors in non-recurring roles appeared only once or twice in the series. Notable exceptions who appeared in three or more films as different characters include [[Doug McClure]], [[Darren McGavin]], [[Dennis Weaver]], [[Earl Holliman]], [[Leonard Nimoy]], [[Barbara Eden]], [[Elizabeth Montgomery]], [[Donna Mills]], [[Ed Nelson]], [[Ken Berry]], [[Connie Stevens]], [[Myrna Loy]] and [[William Windom (actor)|William Windom]].

Many of the telefilms had actors credited as [[Guest appearance|guest stars]], special guest stars and "special appearance by," even if the movie was not a pilot for a series. ''Death Race'' and ''The Weekend Nun'' billed their lead actors as special guest stars. In the unusual case of ''[[Assault on the Wayne]],'' all of the first-billed cast members were credited as guest stars.

==End==
The series proper ended in 1975 as ABC's ratings collapsed that season. Analysts laid part of the blame on ABC's reliance on the ''MotW,'' which had suffered from ratings fatigue as well as a perceived drop in quality in its final season. After that, ABC's made-for-TV movies were either aired as stand-alone specials or shown in time slots that included both original and theatrical movie presentations, notably the ''ABC Friday Night Movie'' and the ''ABC Sunday Night Movie''. The ''Tuesday Movie of the Week'' would later be incorporated as part of ''ABC Late Night'', a replacement of ''[[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment]]'' that ran from 1976 to 1982; the late-night version would mainly feature repeats of movies, both made for television and traditional theatrical releases, that were previously seen on ABC and other networks. ABC continued to premiere new TV films on Sunday nights in [[prime time]] until 2005.

'''''A Thurber Carnival''''' is a [[revue]] by [[James Thurber]], adapted by the author from his stories, cartoons and casuals (humorous short pieces),&lt;ref&gt;The term casual was used by [[Harold Ross]], founding editor of ''The New Yorker'', to refer to "fiction and humorous pieces of all kinds", and "indicated Ross's determination to give the magazine an offhand, chatty, informal quality". Thurber, James, ''The Years With Ross'', 1959 {{ISBN|0-06-095971-1}}, pg. 13. Much of Thurber's work for the magazine consisted of casuals.&lt;/ref&gt; nearly all of which originally appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]''. It was directed by [[Burgess Meredith]]. Following a six city tryout, during which Thurber continued to rewrite the show,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==ACT 1==

The sketches in Act One of the revue are as follows:

===Word Dance (Part 1)===
'''Word Dance (Part 1)''' is a series of [[Punch line|punchline]]s, delivered during breaks in the music as the characters dance, similar to the "Cocktail Party" sketches that later appeared in the television series ''[[Laugh-In]]''. The scene was staged by James Starbuck, with music from the Don Elliott Quartet. The characters were credited only by the generic names (and as "performer" in the [[Internet Broadway Database]]). The punchlines were primarily derived from the captions of Thurber cartoons, including "Where did you get those big brown eyes and that tiny mind?" Part 2 of the sketch appears at the end of Act 2.

===The Night the Bed Fell===
'''The Night the Bed Fell''' consists of First Man sitting at the edge of the stage, telling the story of a particular night from his (Thurber's) childhood, when a collapsing bed provoked remarkable reactions from members of his eccentric extended family. The fictionalized reminiscence first appeared in ''The New Yorker'' on July 8, 1933,&lt;ref name="LOA"&gt;"Note on the Texts", ''James Thurber: Writings and Drawings'' (The Library of America, 1996, {{ISBN|1-883011-22-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; and was reprinted in the book ''[[My Life and Hard Times]]'' ([[1933 in literature|1933]]).

===Fables (Part 1)===
'''Fables (Part 1)''' is a set of three of Thurber's ''Fables for Our Time'', originally staged by James Starbuck. In each fable, the nominally animal characters dress and behave as humans.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; It includes the following:
*'''"The Wolf at the Door"''' - narrated by Second Woman. Characters include the Daughter (Third Woman), the Mother (First Woman), the Father (Second Man) and the Wolf (Fifth Man). The Sheep family argues over whether the visitor at the door is the Wolf or the Fuller Brush Man. The fable originally appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on July 28, 1956,&lt;ref name="Archive"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/ ''The New Yorker'' Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; and was collected in the book ''Further Fables for Our Time'' (1956).
*'''"[[The Unicorn in the Garden]]"''' - narrated by Fourth Man. The characters are Man (First Man), She (Second Woman), Psychiatrist (Third Man) and Policeman (Fifth Man). Based on Thurber's most famous fable, it is about a man who sees a unicorn, and subsequently turns the tables on the hostile wife who does not believe him when he tells her about the incident. The unicorn is not seen on stage.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; The story first appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on October 31, 1939; and was first collected in his book ''Fables for Our Time &amp; Famous Poems Illustrated'' (Harper and Brothers, [[1940 in literature|1940]]).&lt;ref name="LOA"/&gt;
*'''"The Little Girl and the Wolf "'''  - narrated by First Woman. The characters are Wolf (Second Man) and Little Girl (Third Woman). Based on the story of [[Little Red Riding Hood]], it ends with the girl shooting the wolf, who delivers the fable's [[moral]]. The fable first appeared in ''The New Yorker'' on January 21, 1939,&lt;ref name="LOA"/&gt; and was collected in ''Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated'' (1940).

===If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomattox===
'''"If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomattox"''' - narrated by Fourth Man. The characters are  Corporal Shultz of the Sixty-fifth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, aide to Grant (Fifth Man), [[Ulysses S Grant|Grant]] (First Man), [[Robert E Lee|Lee]] (Second Man), Lee's Staff Man (Third Man) and Officer (Fourth Man). Thurber's "what if" story about Grant and Lee at the [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]] surrender first appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on December 6, 1930; and was first collected in his book ''The Middle-Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze'' (Harper and Brothers, [[1940 in literature|1935]]).

===Casuals of the Keys===
'''"Casuals of the Keys"''' features two characters, Visitor (Third Man) and Darrel Darke (Second Man). It consists of Captain Darke telling his visitor unlikely stories of the people he has met.&lt;ref name="Archive"/&gt; The story first appeared in ''The New Yorker'' on May 7, 1932, and was reprinted in ''The Middle Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze''.

===The Macbeth Murder Mystery===
'''"The Macbeth Murder Mystery"''' lists its two characters as He (First Man) and She (First Woman). When a [[murder mystery]] aficionado finds herself with nothing to read but ''[[Macbeth]]'', she concludes that Macbeth was not the killer, and gives her acquaintance a very different way of looking at [[William Shakespeare]]'s works. The story appeared in the ''New Yorker'' on October 2, 1937, and was reprinted in ''[[My World and Welcome to It|My World—and Welcome to It]]'' ([[1942 in literature|1942]]).

===Gentlemen Shoppers===
'''"Gentlemen Shoppers"''' - narrated by Fourth Man. Characters include Salesgirl (Second Woman), Westwater (Third Man), Bargirl (Third Woman), Anderson (First Man), and Bailey (Second Man). This story of drunken shoppers was specially written for ''A Thurber Carnival''.&lt;ref name="Remember"&gt;{{cite book

===The Last Flower===
'''"The Last Flower"''' - The First Man narrates this slide show of Thurber's cartoon series about the aftermath of World War XII, which first appeared as a book, ''The Last Flower: A Parable in Pictures'' (Harper and Brothers, [[1940 in literature|1939]]). An animated version of it was later featured in the Thurber-inspired film ''[[The War Between Men and Women]]''.

==ACT 2==

The sketches in Act Two of the revue are as follows:

===The Pet Department===
'''"The Pet Department"''' features the Announcer (Fourth Man), the Pet Counsellor (First Man), Miss Whittaker (Second Woman), and a Girl (Third Woman). This is an advice show, in which the audience is shown Thurber cartoons of pets about which the advice is sought. Some of the individual letters and responses first appeared in a mock column in ''The New Yorker'' entitled "Our Pet Department" in 1930.&lt;ref name="Archive"/&gt; The complete prose and drawings appeared in ''[[The Owl in the Attic and Other Perplexities]]'' (Harper and Brothers, 1931).

===Mr. Preble Gets Rid of His Wife===
'''"Mr. Preble Gets Rid of His Wife"''' features Preble (Second Man), Miss Daley (Third Woman), and Mrs. Preble (First Woman). When Mr. Preble wants to run off with another woman, his wife attempts to stage manage her own murder. The story appeared in the ''New Yorker'' on March 4, 1933, and was reprinted in ''[[My World and Welcome to It|My World—and Welcome to It]]''.

===File and Forget===
'''"File and Forget"''' includes the characters James Thurber (First Man), Miss Bagley (Fourth Woman), Miss Alma Winege (First Woman), Miss Wynne (Third Woman), Jeannette Gaines (Second Woman), Clint Jordan (Second Man), H. F. Cluffman: Third Man. The sketch consists of Thurber dictating a series of letters in a vain attempt to keep one of his publishers from sending him books he did not order, and the escalating confusion of the replies. The real Thurber, who was completely blind at the time and nearing the end of his life, played himself in later performances of the show. The original casual appeared in the ''New Yorker'' on January 8, 1949,&lt;ref name="Archive"/&gt; and was reprinted in ''Thurber Country: The Classic Collection About Males, and Females, Mainly of Our Own Species'' ([[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1953).

===Take Her Up Tenderly===
'''"Take Her Up Tenderly"''' features the characters John (Second Man), Nellie (Second Woman), and Lou (First Woman), updating classic poetry to be more cheerful.&lt;ref name="Time review"&gt;{{cite web

''Thurber Country: A New Collection of Pieces About Males and Females, Mainly of Our Own Species''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fables (Part 2) ===
'''"Fables (Part 2) "''' consists of two more Thurber fables, originally staged by James Starbuck. They are:
*'''"The Owl Who Was God"''' - narrated by Second Woman, this features the characters Owl (Third Man), Moles (Fourth Man and Fifth Man), Secretary Bird (Second Man), and Red Fox (Fourth Woman), in a story about too many people being fooled "too much of the time". The fable first appeared in ''The New Yorker'' on April 29, 1939,&lt;ref name="LOA"/&gt; and was collected in ''Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated'' (1940).
*'''"The Clothes Moth and the Luna Moth"''' -  narrated by First Man, this cynical story of unrequited desire features two characters, Luna Moth (Third Woman) and Clothes Moth (Fifth Man). The fable first appeared in ''The New Yorker'' on May 19, 1956,&lt;ref name="Archive"/&gt; and was collected in ''Further Fables for Our Time'' (1956).

===The Secret Life of Walter Mitty===

Berg (Fourth Man), Nurse (Third Woman), Dr. Renshaw (Third Man), Dr. Benbow (Fifth Man), Dr. Remington (Fourth Man), Mr. Pritchard-Mitford (Second Man) and The Leader (Second Man). Mitty, a meek dreamer, imagines himself as the hero of four adventures. The stage version features a slightly more upbeat ending than the short story, with Mitty outwitting a [[firing squad]]. The original short story first appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on March 18, 1939;&lt;ref name="Archive"/&gt; and was first collected in his book ''[[My World and Welcome to It]]'' ([[Harcourt Trade Publishers|Harcourt, Brace and Company]], [[1942 in literature|1942]]).

===Word Dance (Part 2) ===
'''"Word Dance (Part 2) "''' - Originally staged by James Starbuck, this is the continuation of the sketch that begins the show. Like Part 1, it is based on captions from Thurber’s cartoons and some of his other writings. It concludes with a request, taken from the last line of "The Ladies of Orlon" (from ''Alarms &amp; Diversions'', 1957), for the women in the audience to keep their seats until the men have left the theater. "They need, God knows, a head start."

==Staging==
Notes in the script call for a set design (originally by Marvin Reiss) that features painted white furniture, with black lines painted slightly askew to mimic the look of Thurber's cartoons. The scenery also includes backdrops, cutouts and a white scrim that reproduce some of the cartoons themselves. The production is meant to include original music written for the show by Don Elliott.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;

==Album==
An original cast album, featuring both music and dialogue from the show, was released by [[Columbia Records]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castalbumdb.com/rec.cfm?RNumber=1174 ''A Thurber Carnival'' at Cast Album DB.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
James Thurber (writer) and [[Burgess Meredith]] (director) won a 1960 [[Tony Awards]] Special Award for ''A Thurber Carnival''.

==Sequel==
A second revue based on Thurber's work, ''The Beast in Me'', opened on Broadway on May 14, 1963, and closed four days later. Adapted by [[James Costigan]] from eleven of Thurber's ''Fables for Our Time'', it starred [[Kaye Ballard]] and [[Bert Convy]], with music by Don Elliott.&lt;ref name="Kaye"&gt;{{cite book

'''''Amy''''' is a [[survival horror]] [[stealth game|stealth]] video game, released in 2012, developed by [[VectorCell]] and published by Lexis Numérique. ''Amy'' depicts the journey of Amy, an [[Autism|autistic]] [[psychic]] child, and her protector Lana. In a city suffused with a [[zombie]]-type infection which Amy is immune to (and can heal Lana from), Lana must stay near her young charge, for frequent healing, while protecting her from the infected, and the Phoenix Foundation who hopes to exploit her. ''Amy'' received [[List of video games notable for negative reception|negative critical reviews]], although updates were released to address complaints.

==Gameplay==
The player controls Lana, the woman escorting Amy and protecting her as the two attempt to escape their disease-ridden town. They encounter monsters and the military, among other foes, in their attempt to escape.&lt;ref name="Lexis Numerique Press Release" /&gt; The player is forced to protect Amy from the zombies, often making her hide, to avoid detection. However, Lana starts succumbing to the plague without medicine, and thus must remain close to Amy, to return for healing. There are syringes infrequently, which allow Lana to heal without returning to Amy. However, when Lana is somewhat infected, she can safely walk past zombies, which necessitates a balance between healing and zombification. At certain times, Lana must rely on Amy for other abilities: Amy can use shockwaves, to push enemies and objects, causing distractions, as well as a sound bubble, muffling glass either being smashed or stepped on, defending Lana. Amy also hacks computers and climbs through vents when Lana needs her to.

==Plot==
The player must escort Amy, an autistic 8-year-old as they try to get her out of a city overrun with wild creatures and enemies. Lana (Sabine Crossen) and Amy are traveling to a doctor in Silver City via train, when an explosion derails the train, and their plans. They discover that the people have been turned to monsters via a strange infection, and must escape the monsters, as they continue their journey to the city. They must also fend off the Phoenix Foundation, an organisation who intends to control Amy and exploit her strange powers.&lt;ref name="Lexis Numerique Press Release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexis-games.com/wp-content/uploads/Lexis_GDC-2011_Lineup_Alert_V0.pdf |title=The French Studio Lexis Numerique Announces Lineup and New Assets for Game Developers Conference 2011 |website=Lexis Numérique |accessdate=5 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021173557/http://www.lexis-games.com/wp-content/uploads/Lexis_GDC-2011_Lineup_Alert_V0.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexis-numerique.fr/category/amy-en/ |title=Lexis Numérique announces new lineup at GDC 2011 |website=Lexis Numérique |accessdate=5 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223100126/http://www.lexis-numerique.fr/category/amy-en/ |archivedate=23 February 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
On 3 April 2012, VectorCell announced a patch for ''Amy'' on the game's official [[Facebook]] page. The patch was released on 6 April. Major changes include the saving of the player's progress during chapters, the addition of more checkpoints, skipping of sequences in-game and several corrections to the subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-11-panned-survival-horror-amy-receives-major-update|title=Panned survival horror Amy receives major update|work=Eurogamer.net|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Amy'' received "generally unfavorable reviews" on both platforms according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPS3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCX360"/&gt; [[IGN]]'s Colin Moriarty stated at the end of his review that he "spent at least a dozen hours with [''Amy''], got as far as the end portion of the fifth chapter, and gave up out of sheer anger and frustration."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Jeff Cork stated that "as a downloadable title, I wasn't expecting [''Amy''] to measure up against the triple-A juggernauts of the survival horror genre. However, I was expecting a game that was at least playable and contained some kind of entertainment. Make no mistake: Whether [''Amy''] is delivered to you via download, retail SKU, direct brain wave, or retinal implant, it is terrible and should be avoided."&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; Jim Sterling of ''[[Destructoid]]'' went as far in his review as to describe ''Amy'' as "one of the worst games ever made".&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt; [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]] of ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' criticized the game's awkward camera views, poor optimization to Xbox, and also gave up the game in frustration due to the addition of poorly implemented stealth mechanics, and later stated that it was the worst game of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Escapist |date=8 August 2012 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehcU90xJrwE |title=AMY (Zero Punctuation) |website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=[[Alphabet Inc.]] |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Escapist |date=9 January 2013 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6MI1ZSRfg |title=TOP 5 GAMES OF 2012 (Zero Punctuation) |website=YouTube |publisher=Alphabet Inc. |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most positive PlayStation 3 review was given by Thomas Pichler from ''GamingXP''.

He also criticised the combination of a bad control system and widely spaced checkpoints that meant the player would have to repeat sections numerous times.&lt;ref name=GamesRadarRev&gt;{{cite web |last=Bradley |first=Adam |date=13 January 2012 |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/amy-review/ |title=AMY review (X360) |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |publisher=Future plc |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

411Mania gave the Xbox 360 version a score of 3.3 out of 10 and said that it "tries to offer something new. The good news is that it does introduce some new gameplay concepts that can be toyed with by developers. The bad news, the controls and gameplay are implemented in such a way the game will just leave you frustrated and angry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vote |first=Todd |date=17 January 2012 |url=http://www.411mania.com/games/downloadable_content/219806/Amy-(Xbox-Live-Arcade)-Review.htm |title=Amy (Xbox Live Arcade) Review |website=411Mania |accessdate=20 April 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512093256/http://www.411mania.com/games/downloadable_content/219806/Amy-(Xbox-Live-Arcade)-Review.htm |archivedate=12 May 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Arendt of ''The Escapist'' gave the same console version one-and-a-half stars out of five and stated, "Pick something to hate about videogames, and ''Amy'' has it.

The game's few good ideas simply aren't enough to suffer through the amount of crap surrounding them."&lt;ref name="Escapist"/&gt; ''[[The A.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22248">The '''Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance''' (also known as the '''Dworkin-MacKinnon Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance''' or '''Dworkin-MacKinnon Ordinance''') is a name for several proposed [[local ordinance]]s in the United States and that was closely associated with the [[anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] [[Andrea Dworkin]] and [[Catharine MacKinnon]]. It proposed to treat [[pornography]] as a violation of women's [[civil rights]] and to allow women harmed by pornography to seek damages through [[lawsuit]]s in [[civil law (common law)|civil court]]s. The approach was distinguished from traditional [[obscenity]] law, which attempts to suppress pornography through the use of [[prior restraint]] and [[criminal law|criminal penalties]].

The ordinances were originally written in 1983 by Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon, and supported by many (but not all) of their fellow members of the feminist anti-pornography movement. Versions of the ordinance were passed in several cities in the [[United States]] during the 1980s, but were blocked by city officials and struck down by courts, who found it to violate the [[freedom of speech]] protections of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

== History ==
The idea of combating pornography through civil rights litigation in the United States was first developed in 1980. [[Linda Boreman]], who had appeared in the pornographic film ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' as "Linda Lovelace," published a memoir, ''Ordeal'', in which she stated that she had been beaten and raped by her ex-husband [[Chuck Traynor]], and violently coerced into making Deep Throat. Boreman held a press conference, with Andrea Dworkin, feminist lawyer Catharine MacKinnon, and members of [[Women Against Pornography]] supporting her, in which she made her charges public for the press corps. Dworkin, MacKinnon, and [[Gloria Steinem]] began discussing the possibility of legal redress for Boreman under federal [[civil rights]] law. Two weeks later, they met with Boreman to discuss the idea of pursuing a lawsuit against Traynor and other pornographers. She was interested, but Steinem discovered that the [[statute of limitations]] for a possible suit had passed, and Boreman backed off (Brownmiller 337). Dworkin and MacKinnon, however, began to discuss the possibility of civil rights litigation as an approach to combatting pornography.

In the fall of 1983, MacKinnon secured a one-semester appointment for Dworkin at the [[University of Minnesota]], to teach a course in literature for the [[Women's Studies]] program and co-teach (with MacKinnon) an interdepartmental course on pornography. Hearing about the course, community activists from south [[Minneapolis]] contacted Dworkin and MacKinnon to ask for their help in curbing the rise of pornography shops. Dworkin and MacKinnon explained their idea for a new civil rights approach to pornography, which would define pornography as a [[civil rights]] violation against women, and allow women who had been harmed by pornography to sue the producers and distributors in civil court for damages. The Minneapolis city council hired Dworkin and MacKinnon as consultants to help the city find an approach to deal with pornography. Public hearings were held by the city council, with testimony from Linda Boreman, [[Ed Donnerstein]] (a pornography researcher from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]), and [[Pauline Bart]], a radical feminist professor from Chicago. The ordinance was passed on December 30, 1983 but [[veto]]ed by Mayor [[Donald M. Fraser]] (who opposed the idea on its merits and also claimed that the city ought not get involved in litigation over the ordinance's constitutionality). The ordinance was passed a second time in July 1984, and was vetoed again by Fraser. In the interim, the city council in [[Indianapolis]] invited Dworkin and MacKinnon to draft a similar ordinance, and also held public hearings. A different version of the ordinance, rewritten to focus specifically on pornography that depicted violence, was passed by the [[Indianapolis]] city council and signed into law by Mayor [[William Hudnut]] on May 1, 1984. However, the law was quickly challenged in court, and overturned as [[United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]]'s ruling on [[American Booksellers v. Hudnut]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] denied to hear the case, thus leaving the ordinance unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;http://mediacoalition.org/press-release-aba-hudnut-supreme-court/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/02/24/The-Supreme-Court-handing-feminists-and-religious-conservatives-a/7440509605200/&lt;/ref&gt; The case is often cited as an important decision on [[freedom of speech]] as applied to [[pornography]].

In spite of the defeat in the courts, Dworkin, MacKinnon, and some other feminists continued to advocate versions of the civil rights ordinance, organizing campaigns to place it on the ballot as a voter [[initiative]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 1985 (where it was voted down in the [[referendum]] 58%–42%), and then again in [[Bellingham, Washington]] in 1988 (where it was passed). The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] filed suit against the city of Bellingham after the ordinance was passed, and the federal court again struck the law down on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds.

Feminists were strongly divided over the anti-pornography ordinance. Some feminists, such as [[Wendy McElroy]], [[Ellen Willis]], and [[Susie Bright]], opposed anti-pornography feminism on principle, identifying with [[sex-positive feminism|sex-positive feminist]] position in the [[feminist sex wars]] of the 1980s. Many anti-pornography feminists supported the legislative efforts, but others—including [[Susan Brownmiller]], [[Janet Gornick]], and [[Wendy Kaminer]]—agreed with Dworkin and MacKinnon's critique of pornography, but opposed the attempt to combat it through legislative campaigns, which they feared would be rendered ineffectual by the courts, would violate principles of free speech, or would harm the anti-pornography movement by taking organizing energy away from education and [[direct action]] and entangling it in political squabbles (Brownmiller 318–321).

== ''Butler'' decision in Canada ==
In 1992, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] made a ruling in [[R. v. Butler]] (the Butler decision) which incorporated some elements of Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal approach to pornography into the existing Canadian obscenity law. In ''Butler'' the Court held that Canadian obscenity law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] if enforced on grounds of morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law ''could'' be enforced constitutionally against some pornography on the basis of the Charter's guarantees of sex equality. The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the [[Women's Legal Education and Action Fund]] (LEAF), with the support and participation of Catharine MacKinnon. Andrea Dworkin opposed LEAF's position, arguing that feminists should not support or attempt to reform criminal obscenity law. In 1993, copies of Dworkin's book ''Pornography'' were held for inspection by Canadian customs agents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Margulis | first = Zachary |title= Canada's thought police |url= http://www.efc.ca/pages/wired-3.03.html | work = WIRED 3.03: Electrosphere |publisher=Electronic Frontier Canada [La Frontière Électronique du Canada]|date= 1995 |accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; fostering an urban legend that Dworkin's own books had been banned from Canada under a law that she herself had promoted. However, the Butler decision did not adopt Dworkin and MacKinnon's ordinance; MacKinnon and Dworkin claimed that Dworkin's books (which were released shortly after they were inspected) was a standard procedural measure, unrelated to the ''Butler'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last1 = Dworkin | first1 = Andrea | last2 = MacKinnon | first2 = Catharine | author-link1 = Andrea Dworkin | author-link2 = Catharine MacKinnon | title = Dworkin/MacKinnon press release about Canada | url = http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/OrdinanceCanada.html | work = [[No Status Quo]] | publisher = [[Nikki Craft]] |date=26 August 1994 |accessdate=9 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of pornography in the ordinance ==
Dworkin and MacKinnon placed special emphasis on the legal definition of pornography provided in the civil rights ordinance. The civil rights ordinance characterizes pornography as a form of "sex discrimination" and defines "pornography" as ''"the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures and/or words,"'' when combined with one of several other conditions. In the [http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/other/ordinance/newday/AppD.htm "model ordinance"] that they drafted, Dworkin and MacKinnon gave the following legal definition:

:1. "Pornography" means the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures and/or words that also includes one or more of the following:
:
::a. women are presented dehumanized as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]], things or commodities; or
::
::b. women are presented as sexual objects who enjoy [[Sadomasochism|humiliation or pain]]; or
::
::c. women are presented as sexual objects experiencing sexual pleasure in rape, incest, or other sexual assault; or
::
::d. women are presented as sexual objects tied up or cut up or mutilated or bruised or physically hurt; or
::
::e. women are presented in postures or positions of sexual submission, servility, or display; or
::
::f. women's body parts—including but not limited to vaginas, breasts, or buttocks—are exhibited such that women are reduced to those parts; or
::
::g. women are presented being penetrated by objects or [[Zoophilia|animals]]; or
::
::h. women are presented in scenarios of degradation, humiliation, injury, [[torture]], shown as filthy or inferior, bleeding, bruised or hurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual.
::
:2. The use of men, children, or [[Transsexualism|transsexuals]] in the place of women in (a)–(h) of this definition is also pornography for purposes of this law.
:
:3. "Person" shall include child or transsexual.

== Causes for action ==
Each version of the ordinance provided different ''causes for action'' under which women could file sex discrimination suits related to pornography.

The [http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/other/ordinance/newday/AppA.htm original version of the ordinance passed in Minneapolis], the [http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/other/ordinance/newday/AppB1.htm Indianapolis ordinance], and the [http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/other/ordinance/newday/AppC.htm proposed Cambridge ordinance] each recognized four causes for action that could justify a sex discrimination suit:

* '''''Trafficking in pornography''''', defined as the production, sale, exhibition, or distribution of pornographic materials. Making pornography available for study in government-funded public libraries and public or private university libraries was exempted from being considered discrimination by trafficking. Any woman could claim a cause for action against the trafficker(s) as a woman acting against the subordination of women. Men or transsexuals who alleged injury by pornography in the way that women are injured by it could also sue.
* '''''Coercion into pornographic performances'''''. Any person coerced, intimidated, or fraudulently induced into pornography could sue the maker(s), seller(s), exhibitor(s), or distributor(s), both for damages and to have the product or products of the performances eliminated from public view. The law stated that a number of specific factors, including past sexual history, other involvement in [[prostitution]] or [[pornography]], the appearance of cooperation during the performance, or payment for the performance, could not by used (by themselves, without further evidence) as evidence against a claim of coercion.
* '''''Forcing pornography on a person''''' in a home, workplace, school, or public place. Any person who has pornography forced on her or him could sue the perpetrator and the institution.
* '''''Assault or physical attack due to pornography'''''. The victim of an assault, physical attack, or injury "directly caused by specific pornography" could seek damages from the maker(s), distributor(s), seller(s), and/or exhibitor(s) of the pornography, and an injunction against the further exhibition, distribution, or sale of that specific pornography.

The [http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/other/ordinance/newday/AppD.htm Model Ordinance] that Dworkin and MacKinnon advocated in ''[http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/other/ordinance/newday/TOC.htm Pornography and Civil Rights: A New Day for Women's Equality]'' (1988), and the version of the ordinance passed in [[Bellingham, Washington]] the same year, added a fifth cause of action in addition to these four:

* '''''Defamation through pornography''''', defined as defaming any person (including public figures) through the unauthorized use of their proper name, image, or recognizable personal likeness in pornography, and allowing for authorization, if given, to be revoked in writing at any time prior to the publication of the pornography.

== Criticism ==
The most vocal critic of Mackinnon and (Andrea) Dworkin's rights-based approach to pornography is [[Ronald Dworkin]], who rejects the argument that the private consumption of pornography can be said to be a breach of women's civil rights.&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;West, Caroline (Fall 2013), "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/pornography-censorship Feminist perspectives on sex markets: pornography]", {{cite book | editor-last = Zalta | editor-first = Edward N. | editor-link = Edward N. Zalta | title = [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald Dworkin states that the Ordinance rests on the "frightening principle that considerations of equality require that some people not be free to express their tastes or convictions or preferences anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dworkin | first = Ronald | author-link = Ronald Dworkin | title = Women and pornography | journal = [[The New York Review of Books]] | volume = 40 | issue = 17 | publisher = Rea S.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack was the first collaboration with the directors long standing composer [[Moxie (composer)|Evan "Moxie" Kitchener]]. Their other features are [[Only the Young Die Good|Only The Young Die Good]] and [[Burlesque (2010 Australian film)|Burlesque]]. The score has been described as tense and quite haunting.&lt;ref name="severed-cinema1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://severed-cinema.com/b-reviews/bad-habits-dank-films |title=Horror Movie Reviews, Cult, Obscure Movie Reviews, News, Interviews, Screenshots, DVD, VHS, Blu-ray and More - Bad Habits - DANK Films |publisher=Severed Cinema |date=2011-02-25 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Bad Habits has received mostly positive reviews upon its release.

''Digital-retribution'' gave it 4 out of 5 saying, "Clever, gruesome, grotesque and all wrapped up in a gloriously slimy coat of sleaze, Bad Habits shows that its writer/director Dominic Deacon, and his crew who acquit themselves admirably, is a name to look out for. Next film please folks!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-retribution.com/reviews/oz/022.php |title=Bad Habits Review |publisher=Digital Retribution |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Severed Cinema's Ray Casta gave 3 and a half stars (out of five) and said, "The film is also erotic and psychosexual, but it never once succumbs to exploitation.  A nice touch are the homage's to 1970's Italian cinema which are plentiful.  Dominic Deacon's "Bad Habits" is a naughty, Giallo-inspired head-trip that takes the viewer on a dark journey where nothing is what it seems".&lt;ref name="severed-cinema1"/&gt;

Scaryminds.com gave it a perfect 10 out of 10 and said, "One of the best movies I've seen all year, full recommendation to anyone who loves them some quality cinema. Bad Habits will provide the fix true movie fans have been waiting on all year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scaryminds.com/reviews/2011/movie211.php |title=Scaryminds Reviews Bad Habits (2009) |publisher=Scaryminds.com |date=2011-12-31 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bases Loaded II: Second Season''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Moero!! Pro Yakyū '88 Kettei Ban'''''|燃えろ!!プロ野球’88決定版|Burn!! Pro Baseball '88 Decision Version}}, is a [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] released in 1988. It is the [[sequel]] to ''[[Bases Loaded (video game)|Bases Loaded]]'' and is continued by ''[[Bases Loaded 3]]''. As opposed to the original, ''Bases Loaded II'' (and the sequels) was developed directly for [[Nintendo]]'s [[video game console|consoles]] and never saw an [[arcade game|arcade]] version. The game is the second installment of the ''Bases Loaded'' series. The game was novelized by [[Peter Lerangis]], as part of the ''[[Worlds of Power]]'' series published by [[Scholastic Books]].

== Gameplay ==
Like its predecessor, ''Bases Loaded II'' offers both a single-game mode and a single-
player "pennant race" mode. In the "pennant race", a player must first achieve at least a 75-55 record during the regular season, then win a best-of-7 "[[World Series]]" against [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] or [[New York City|N.Y.]] depending whether you have chosen a team from the Eastern or Western league respectively.

Though some characteristics remained the same between ''Bases Loaded'' and ''Bases Loaded II'' (e.g. the same fictitious 12-team league returns in this game, with new players. It is worth noting that all of the players on the [[Washington, D.C.]] team are named after famous politicians, while all of [[Los Angeles]]'s players take their names from [[Hollywood]] luminaries. In addition, one of Hawaii's pitchers is named [[Don Ho|Ho]].), there are several noteworthy changes.   One new feature was the "[[biorhythm]]" concept; players in the game had "biorhythms" that could be monitored to ensure optimal performance. ''Bases Loaded II'' had a little faster play action than the original game, and the point of view once a ball was hit into play was also different. In ''Bases Loaded'' the view was from behind home plate, whereas in ''Bases Loaded II'' the view was either from the first-base line if the home team was at bat, or from the third-base line if the visiting team was at bat.

One big improvement over the original ''Bases Loaded'' included the ability to modify the starting lineup and batting order for the user controlled team, and clearly defined pitcher's roles which were outlined clearly in the detailed rosters included with the instructional manual.

One other feature largely unique to this particular game was the concept of a mandatory called game via an unconventional "9-run rule."  Also, like in Nippon Professional Baseball, no game was allowed to last more than 12 innings.

==Reception==
[[Allgame]] gave ''Bases Loaded II'' four out of five stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1151&amp;tab=review|title=Bases Loaded II: Second Season|publisher=[[Allgame]]|first=Joshua|last=Hoffman|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9205">The '''blow book''', better known as a '''magic coloring book''' in modern variations, is a classic [[magic trick]] that has been performed for hundreds of years. It was most popular from the [[16th]] to the [[19th]] century, when variations of the concept were a staple of the [[publishing|book publishing]] trade. It has been referred to as the oldest example of a manufactured [[Theatrical property|prop]] used for magic. It remains a common trick today, albeit mostly performed for children, preferably at birthday parties or other events due to the visual nature of the illusion.

==Effect==
The magician presents a book and [[Shuffling|riffles]] through it, showing a number of images in black and white. The book is then closed and a [[Card flourish|flourish]] is performed, normally involving [[audience participation]], originally having an audience member blow on the outside of the book. The magician picks up the book and riffles it again, revealing that the images are now colored, or have changed completely into different images depending on the nature of the book.

==History==
The blow book is one of the oldest magic tricks. It has a history that is well-documented in historical sources,{{sfn|Jay|2014|p=9}} because the trick is based on a device that was only really practical after the widespread introduction of the [[printing press]] in 1450, which created a market for inexpensive paper and binding that the trick relies upon.

The earliest known mention of the concept was by [[Gerolamo Cardano]] in 1550, who described the trick by mentioning "conjurors show different and always unlike pictures in one and the same book".{{sfn|Buchan|2013|p=61}} Another early mention is by [[Reginald Scot]] in his book ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'', published in 1584. This work examined witchcraft and revealed the tricks involved, ultimately concluding that witchcraft was not real.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clements.umich.edu/exhibits/online/bannedbooks/entry2.html "Reginald Scot, The Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584)"] Clements Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Almond, [http://www.ibtauris.com/Books/Humanities/Religion%20%20beliefs/Englands%20First%20Demonologist%20Reginald%20Scot%20and%20The%20Discoverie%20of%20Witchcraft.aspx "England's First Demonologist: Reginald Scot and 'The Discoverie of Witchcraft'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114907/http://www.ibtauris.com/Books/Humanities/Religion%20%20beliefs/Englands%20First%20Demonologist%20Reginald%20Scot%20and%20The%20Discoverie%20of%20Witchcraft.aspx |date=August 26, 2014 }}, I.B.Tauris, 2011, inside cover&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this discussion he mentions the use of blow books, and goes on to describe how to prepare a book that the magician would then "whew you everie leafe to be painted with birds, then with beasts, then with serpents, then with angels, etc."{{sfn|Scot|1584|p=283}} He realized that the preparation might be beyond the capabilities of many would-be magicians, and directs his readers to "buie for a small value the like booke, at the shop of W. Brome in Powles churchyard", the earliest known example of a magic prop for sale. William Broome of St. Paul's in London was active between 1577 and 1591.{{sfn|Stafford &amp; Terpak|2001|p=253}} A similar description of the blow book was published in French the same year by Jean Prévost.{{sfn|Jay|2014|p=10}}

The blow book is mentioned in ''[[Hocus Pocus Junior]]'', the earliest known collection of magic tricks in the [[English language]], published in London in 1635. In this text the concept is called a "iugling booke" ("juggling book") or "booke for Waggery". It contains a complete description of how to prepare a blow book. The author suggests presenting the book by saying "this booke is not painted thus as some of you may suppose, but it is of such a property, that whosoever bloweth on it, it wil give the representation of whatsoever he is naturally addicted unto". He further mentions that in order for the trick to work, one must use a "bold and audacious countenance, for that must be the grace of all your trickes". Many of the tricks in the book feature the magician or an audience member blowing on the prop; this was a common fixture of the trade.{{sfn|Unknown|1635|loc=Iugling booke}} The trick continues to appear in many books on magic through time, often with references to where to buy copies; in ''The Whole Art of Legerdemain'' of 1748 it's mentioned that "the blowing Books ... may have them at my Shop on little Tower-hill".{{sfn|Stafford &amp; Terpak|2001|p=253}}

None of these very early examples of blow books are known to exist today. The earliest surviving examples are a Belgian version from the 16th century,{{sfn|Jay|2014|p=15}} and French and Italian books from the second half of the 18th century.{{sfn|Stafford &amp; Terpak|2001|p=253}} By the 19th century prices on printed materials had dropped so much that the trick was quite well known, and it was not uncommon for magicians of the period to hand them out after their performances.{{sfn|Jay|2014|p=12}} [[Quaker Oats]] even gave out a version in their cereal.&lt;ref&gt;The Print Collector's Newsletter, 1995, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic concept has never gone out of print for long, and modern examples remain widespread today, along with descriptions on how to make your own. Modern versions are typically in the form of children's [[coloring book]]s and remain popular, even appearing on [[The Wiggles]].{{sfn|Kaufman|2010|pp= 220-223}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwCdRbJEJmU The Wiggles - Magic: Coloring Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanical resemblance of the blow book to the early animation concept known as a [[flip book]] has been a subject of some consideration in animation circles. Whether the blow book inspired the flip book remains an unanswered question.{{sfn|Stafford &amp; Terpak|2001|p=253}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013|p=61}}

==Description==
The most basic version of the blow book is based on alternating pages being different widths. The book is assembled by alternating the different pages, wide, narrow, wide, narrow (etc.), and then binding them together. Images of one type, black and white for instance, are drawn on every set of facing pages with narrow on the left and wide on the right. The alternate set of images, color in this example, are drawn on the alternate sets of pages with the wide page on the left and narrow on the right. The result is a series of alternating images on sets of facing pages.{{sfn|Unknown|1635|loc=Iugling booke}}

To perform the trick, the book is held by the binding in one hand and riffled with the other; for [[right handed]] magicians this will normally mean the binding is in the left hand and the riffling is performed with the right hand. By carefully grasping the right side close to the edge, the fingers or thumb are only touching the wider pages, so when the book is riffled two pages flip each time, the wider page under the thumb, and the narrower one on top of it. This way the audience is always seeing the face side of a wide page and the back of a narrow one. To complete the trick, the book is simply riffled with the right hand inverted, or more commonly, by rotating the entire book around its transverse (horizontal) axis while the audience is directed elsewhere. This causes the upper side of the narrow pages to display along with the back of the wider ones. Images drawn on alternating pages are thus shown or hidden depending on where the thumb is placed.{{sfn|Kaufman|2010|pp= 220&amp;ndash;223}}

More complex versions of the same basic concept can be used to have multiple sets of pages with different images. In these cases the pages are wider or narrower in a pattern along the entire length of the outer edge, creating a number of "hot spots" where the book can be riffled to cause different pages to appear. ''Hocus Pocus'' creates a similar concept by using small pieces of paper pasted to the pages to create the same effect, allowing the magician to grasp the tabs while they riffle. This version allows any number of pages per flip, the ''Pocus'' version using sets of eight pages.{{sfn|Unknown|1635|loc=Iugling booke}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2646">The '''Bondareva–Shapley theorem''', in [[game theory]], describes a [[necessary and sufficient condition]] for the [[Empty set|non-emptiness]] of the [[Core (economics)|core]] of a [[cooperative game]] in characteristic function form. Specifically, the game's core is non-empty [[if and only if]] the game is ''balanced''. The Bondareva–Shapley theorem implies that [[market game]]s and [[convex set|convex]] games have non-empty cores. The theorem was formulated independently by [[Olga Bondareva]] and [[Lloyd Shapley]] in the 1960s.

== Theorem ==
Let the [[Ordered pair|pair]] &lt;math&gt;\langle N, v\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be a [[cooperative game]] in characteristic function form, where &lt;math&gt; N;&lt;/math&gt; is the set of players and where the ''value function'' &lt;math&gt; v: 2^N \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; is defined on &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;'s [[power set]] (the set of all subsets of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;br&gt;

The core of &lt;math&gt;\langle N, v \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is non-empty if and only if for every function &lt;math&gt;\alpha : 2^N \setminus \{\emptyset\} \to [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\forall i \in N : \sum_{S \in 2^N : \; i \in S} \alpha (S) = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
the following condition holds: 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{S \in 2^N\setminus\{\emptyset\}} \alpha (S) v (S) \leq v (N).&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Iwakuni Digital TV Repeater.JPG|thumb|[[Iwakuni]] relay station of terrestrial digital television broadcasting]]
A '''broadcast relay station''' also known as a '''satellite station''', '''relay transmitter''', '''broadcast translator''' (U.S.), '''rebroadcaster''' (Canada), '''[[repeater]]''' ([[two-way radio]]), or '''complementary station''' (Mexico) is a broadcast transmitter device which repeats, or [[transponder|transponds]], the signal of a radio or television station to an area not covered by the signal of the originating station. They may expand the [[broadcast range]] of a television or radio station beyond the primary signal's original coverage area or to improve service in a part of the original coverage area. These transmitters may be, but are not usually, used to create a [[single-frequency network]]. They may also be used by an FM or AM radio station to establish a presence on the other band.

Sometimes, a rebroadcaster may be owned by a community group rather than the owner of the primary station. For example, [[WHLS]]/[[WHLX]] of [[Port Huron, Michigan]] purchased a translator, and shortly after that switched to an [[alternative rock]] format without mentioning the original FM translator, except for their legally required top-of-the-hour ID. No AM frequencies have been mentioned.
{{TOC left|limit=3}}
{{-}}

==Types==

===Broadcast translators===
In its simplest form, a broadcast translator is a facility created to receive a terrestrial broadcast over-the-air on one frequency and rebroadcast the same or substantially identical signal on another frequency. These stations are used in television and radio to cover areas such as valleys or rural villages which are not adequately covered by a station's main signal. They can also be used to expand market coverage by duplicating programming on one band to another.

===Boosters and distributed transmission===
Relays which broadcast within or very near the parent station's coverage area (a "fill-in") on the ''same'' channel or frequency are called "booster" stations in the U.S. However, this can pose difficulties because the signals from the two stations may interfere with each other unless they are carefully designed. [[Co-channel interference|Radio interference]] can be avoided by using exact [[atomic time]] obtained from [[Global positioning system|GPS]] [[satellite]]s to perfectly [[synchronise]] co-channel stations, as in a [[single-frequency network]].

Analog television stations cannot have same-channel boosters unless opposite ([[perpendicular]]) [[Polarization (waves)|polarisation]] is used, due to video [[synchronization]] issues such as [[ghosting (television)|ghosting]]. In the U.S., no new on-channel UHF signal boosters have been authorized since July 11, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=;rgn=div5;view=text;node=47%3A4.0.1.1.3;idno=47;cc=ecfr#47:4.0.1.1.3.7.3.12 |title=US CFR 47 Part 74G – 74.733 UHF translator signal boosters |publisher=Ecfr.gpoaccess.gov |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305205415/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=;rgn=div5;view=text;node=47:4.0.1.1.3;idno=47;cc=ecfr#47:4.0.1.1.3.7.3.12 |archive-date=March 5, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Distributed transmission]] (DTx) is the use of several medium-power stations (usually digital) on the same frequency to cover a broadcast area, rather than one high-power station with repeaters on a different frequency. [[Digital television]] stations are technically capable of sharing a channel, however this is more difficult with the [[8VSB]] [[modulation]] and invariable [[guard interval]] used in the [[ATSC]] standard than with [[COFDM]] used in the European and Australian [[DVB-T]] standard. A [[distributed transmission system]] would therefore have tight synchronisation requirements which requires each transmitter to receive its signal from one central source for broadcast at a GPS-synchronised time. DTS (or DTx) are not broadcast repeaters in the conventional sense as they cannot simply receive the signal of one main terrestrial broadcast transmitter for rebroadcast; to do so would introduce a retransmission delay which breaks the precise synchronisation required, causing interference between individual transmitters.

The use of [[virtual channel]]s is another alternative, though this may cause the same channel to appear multiple times on a receiver (once for each relay station), and require the user to manually tune to the best one (which may change due to [[radio propagation]] conditions like weather). Use of boosters or DTx instead causes all relay stations to ideally appear as a single signal, but requires significant [[broadcast engineering]] to work properly and not cause destructive interference.

===Satellite stations===
Some fully licensed stations [[simulcast]] another station. These are relay stations in name only and are generally licensed the same as any other major station. This is unregulated in the U.S. and is widely allowed in Canada, while otherwise the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulates [[radio format]]s to ensure a diverse variety of programming.

U.S. satellite stations may request that the FCC grant an exemption to requirements that a properly staffed [[Television studio|broadcast studio]] be maintained in the [[city of license]] or (in rural states) that television programming be simulcast in both [[NTSC-M|analogue]] and [[ATSC|digital]] during [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital television transition]]. These stations most often cover vast but sparsely populated regions (in economic hardship) or are operated as statewide [[educational television|non-commercial educational]] [[NPR|radio]] and [[PBS|television]] systems.

===Semi-satellites===
A television rebroadcaster often sells local or regional advertising for broadcast only on the local transmitter, and may also air a very limited amount of distinct programming from their parent station. Some such "semi-satellites" broadcast their own local newscasts, or separate news segments during part of the [[News broadcasting|newscast]]. For example, [[CHEX-TV-2]] in [[Oshawa, Ontario|Oshawa]], [[Ontario]], aired daily late afternoon and early evening news and community programs separate from its parent station, [[CHEX-DT|CHEX-TV]] in [[Peterborough, Ontario]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel12.ca/about.php CHEX-TV-2 Durham: About Channel 12] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223135228/http://www.channel12.ca/about.php |date=February 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] prohibits this on FM translator stations, and only allows it on different fully licensed stations.

In some cases, a semi-satellite is a formerly autonomous full-service station which is being programmed remotely through [[centralcasting]] or broadcast automation in order to avoid the cost of retaining a full local staff. [[CBLFT-DT|CBLFT]], an [[owned-and-operated station]] of the [[Canadian French|French language]] network [[Ici Radio-Canada Télé]] in [[Toronto]], is a ''de facto'' semi-satellite of its stronger [[Ottawa]] sibling [[CBOFT-DT|CBOFT]] as its programming has long either been identical or differed only in local news and advertising. A financially weak privately owned broadcaster in a small market can easily become a ''de facto'' semi-satellite by gradually curtailing local production and relying on a commonly owned station in a larger city for programming ([[WWTI]] in [[Watertown, New York|Watertown]], [[New York (state)|New York]], relies on [[WSYR-TV]] in this manner). [[Broadcast automation]] allows substitution of any [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programming]] or [[digital subchannel]] content which the broadcaster was unable to obtain for both cities.

Some defunct full-service stations (such as [[CJSS-TV]] in [[Cornwall, Ontario]], now [[CJOH-DT|CJOH-TV-8]]) have been turned into full satellites and originate nothing. If programming from the parent station must be removed or substituted due to local [[Blackout (broadcasting)|sports blackouts]], the modified signal is ''de facto'' that of a semi-satellite station.

===National networks===
Most broadcasters outside of North America maintain a national network and use several relay transmitters to provide the same service to a region or entire nation. In comparison to the other types of relays explained above, the transmitter network is often created and maintained by an independent authority, often paid for using [[television license]] fees, and multiple major broadcasters use the same transmitters.

In North America, a similar pattern of regional network broadcasting is sometimes employed by statewide or province-wide [[educational television]] networks such as [[Kentucky Educational Television]], [[UNC-TV]], [[Vermont Public Television]], [[Wisconsin Public Television]], [[TVOntario]] or [[Télé-Québec]]; a state or province establishes one educational station and extends it with multiple full-power transmitters to cover the entire jurisdiction with no capability for local programming origination. In the U.S., a regional network of rebroadcast sites may in turn join the national [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] as an individual member station.

==Relay transmitters by country==

===Canada===
In Canada, "rebroadcaster" or "rebroadcasting transmitter" are the terms most commonly used by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC).

====Television====
A television rebroadcaster may be permitted to sell local or regional advertising for broadcast only on the local transmitter. On rarer occasions, they may also air a very limited amount of distinct programming from their parent station. Some such "semi-satellites" broadcast their own local newscasts, or separate news segments during part of the newscast.

There is no strict rule for the [[call sign]] of a television rebroadcaster. Some transmitters have distinct call signs from the parent station (for example, [[CFGC-TV|CFGC]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] is a rebroadcaster of [[CIII-DT|CIII]]), while others use the call sign of the originating station followed by a number (e.g., the former [[CBLFT-DT|CBLFT-17]] in [[Sarnia, Ontario|Sarnia]], Ontario). Officially, the latter type includes the television station's "-TV" suffix between the call sign and the number, although in media directories this is often left out for convenience.

In the latter case, the numbers are usually applied sequentially, starting from one and denoting the chronological order in which the station's rebroadcast transmitters began operation. Some broadcasters may, at their discretion, use a system in which the number denotes the actual broadcast channel of the transmitter (e.g., [[CJOH-DT|CJOH-TV-47]] in [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]]). A broadcaster cannot, however, mix the two numbering systems under a single call sign – the transmitters are either ''all'' numbered sequentially or ''all'' numbered by their analogue channel position. On the rare occasion that the sequential numbering reaches 99 (e.g., [[TVOntario]]'s former broadcast transmitters), rather than being numbered as 100 the next transmitter is assigned a new call sign and numbered as one. Translators which share the same frequency (such as [[CBLT-DT|CBLT]]'s former repeaters CBLET, CBLHT, CBLAT-2 and CH4113, all on channel 12) are also given distinct call signs.

Digital rebroadcasters may be numbered using the television channel number of the analogue signal which they replaced; TVOntario's CICO-DT-53 (digital UHF 26, [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]]) is one example (that station was converted in 2011 solely to vacate an out-of-core analogue channel, UHF 53, and retains CICO-TV-53's former analogue UHF television call sign numbering as one of the few surviving TVO repeaters).

[[Low-power broadcasting|Low-power]] rebroadcasters may also have a call sign which consists of the letters "CH" followed by four numbers. For example, [[CH2649]] in [[Valemount, British Columbia]] is a rebroadcaster of [[Vancouver]]'s [[CHAN-DT|CHAN]]. Rebroadcasters of this type are numbered strictly sequentially to the order in which they were licensed by the CRTC, and their call signs have no inherent relationship to those of the parent stations or of other rebroadcasters. Although the next number in the sequence, CH2650 in [[Anzac, Alberta]], is also a rebroadcaster of CHAN, this is simply because CH2649 and CH2650 happened to be licensed simultaneously – the following number, CH2651, is a rebroadcaster (also in Anzac) of [[Edmonton]]'s [[CITV-DT|CITV]]. A single station's rebroadcasters are not necessarily all named in the same manner. [[CBLT-DT|CBLT]], for example, had some retransmitters which had their own call signs, some which used CBLT followed by a number ''and'' some transmitters with CH numbers.

All CBC and Radio-Canada owned-and-operated retransmitters were shut down permanently on August 1, 2012, along with most TVOntario transmitters (which often were located at Radio-Canada sites) and some [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network]] (APTN) transmitters in the far north. Private commercial broadcasters continue to operate some full-power rebroadcasters as a means of obtaining "must carry" status on [[cable television]] systems.

Transmitters in small markets with one (or no) originating stations were in most cases not required to convert to digital, even if operating at full-power. Transmitters broadcasting on high-band UHF channels 52–69 were required to vacate those channels by August 31, 2011; some (such as a [[CKWS-DT|CKWS-TV]] retransmitter in [[Brighton, Ontario]], and three of the TVOntario sites) did go digital as part of a move to a lower frequency but do not provide [[high-definition television]] service, extra [[digital subchannel]]s or any functionality beyond that of the original analogue site.

====Radio====
As in television, a radio rebroadcaster may have either a distinct call sign or use the calls of the originating station followed by a numeric suffix. In the case of radio, however, the numeric suffix is always sequential.

For a rebroadcaster of an [[FM radio|FM]] station, the numeric suffix is appended to the FM suffix. For example, rebroadcasters of [[CJBC-FM]] in Toronto are numbered CJBC-FM-1, CJBC-FM-2, etc. Where an [[AM radio|AM]] station has a rebroadcaster operating on the FM band, the numeric suffix instead falls ''between'' the four-letter call sign and the FM suffix – for example, CKSB-1-FM is an FM rebroadcaster of the AM station [[CKSB (AM)|CKSB]], while CKSB-FM-1 would be a rebroadcaster of [[CKSB-FM]].

As a broadcaster is limited to no more than two stations on one radio band in a market, one possible means to obtain a third FM signal in-market is to use a rebroadcaster of the AM station to move that signal onto low-power FM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2008/080728/nerw.html#can |title=NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush |publisher=Fybush.com |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sarnia, [[Blackburn Radio]] already owns [[CFGX-FM]] (99.9) and [[CHKS-FM]] (106.3); its third Sarnia station [[CHOK]] (1070) uses an FM repeater for in-city coverage as "Country 103.9" FM, although officially the AM signal remains the station's primary transmitter.

Low-power radio rebroadcasters may also have a call sign which consists of the letters "VF" followed by four numbers; however, a call sign of this type may also denote a low-power station which originates its own programming and is not a rebroadcaster. Some stations licensed under the CRTC's experimental broadcasting guidelines, a special class of short-term license (similar to [[special temporary authority]])  sometimes granted to newer [[campus radio|campus]] and [[community radio]] operations, may have another distinct class of call sign which consists of three letters from anywhere within Canada's ITU prefix range followed by three digits – e.g. [[CFU758]] or VEK565. Some other stations within this license class, however, have been assigned conventional C''xxx'' call signs.

Occasionally, former rebroadcasters have been converted to originating stations in their own right, but have retained their former call sign instead of being reassigned a new one of their own. Such stations include [[CITE-FM-1]] in [[Sherbrooke]], [[CBF-FM-8]] in [[Trois-Rivières]] and [[CBAF-FM-15]] in [[Charlottetown]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Decisions/1994/DB94-339.HTM{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ; compare with
http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Notices/1993/PB93-136.htm{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} where CBAF-FM-15 was considered by the CRTC as a rebroadcaster.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
In [[Mexico]], translator and booster stations are given the call sign of the parent station.

====Television====
The majority of television stations in Mexico are operated as repeaters of the networks they broadcast. Translator stations in the Mexico are given call signs which begin with XE and XH. [[Televisa]] and [[Azteca (multimedia conglomerate)|Azteca]] each maintain two networks with national reach. Televisa's [[XEW-TV|Canal de las Estrellas]] network includes 128 separately licensed stations, the most in Mexico, while Azteca's networks incorporate 88 and 91 stations. These stations may have the capability to insert local advertising. Azteca's stations in larger cities may include local news and a limited amount of regional content; Televisa prefers to use its non-national [[Gala TV (Mexico)|Gala TV]] network and [[Televisa Regional]] stations as outlets for its local production. On top of the listed number of transmitters for each network, many have multiple translators of their own that serve areas with little or no signal within their defined coverage area, known as ''equipos complementarios de zona de sombra'' ({{lang-en|shadow channels}}). Most shadow channels air the same programming as their parent station, with several notable exceptions. The northern and central regional network [[Multimedios Televisión]] out of [[Monterrey]] uses the same sort of system to a smaller extent (its [[XHSAW-TDT]] serves in the shadow channel role to main station [[XHAW-TDT]] within Monterrey), but mainly offers regional outputs for local newscasts and advertising formed around a master schedule.

There are two main national networks of non-commercial television stations in Mexico. One is the [[Canal Once (Mexico)|Canal Once]] or XEIPN-TDT network run by the [[Instituto Politécnico Nacional]] (IPN). This operates 13 transmitters of its network and airs its programs on 4 more under a contract with the [[Sistema Quintanarroense de Comunicación Social|Quintana Roo state network]]. The other network, operated by the [[Sistema Público de Radiodifusión del Estado Mexicano]] (SPR), incorporates 26 stations (16 in operation), most of which are entirely digital. The SPR transmitters are located almost exclusively in cities where the IPN never built its own stations and carry Canal Once as one of the five educational networks in the multiplex of the digital station.

Additionally, 26 of Mexico's 32 states own and operate television services of their own. 16 of these incorporate more than one transmitter. The largest by number of stations is [[Telemax (television network)|Telemax]], the state network of Sonora, which operates 59 transmitters. Many transmitters in state networks broadcast at very low [[effective radiated power]]s (ERP).

Lastly, a small number of stations are owned by municipalities or translator associations. These are relatively uncommon, and like state networks, transmit at extremely low power.

Transmitters rebroadcasting Mexico City stations into [[Baja California]] and other communities along the Pacific coast normally operate on a two-hour delay relative to the originating station; there is a one-hour delay in [[Sonora]], and [[Quintana Roo]] (which as of 2015 is now one hour ahead of central Mexico) receives programs one hour later (but live) than they are broadcast to most of Mexico.

====Radio====
While comparatively rare, a number of FM shadow channels also exist (approximately 10 to 15). These are required to be co-channel to the stations they retransmit.

The state with the most FM shadow channels is [[Quintana Roo]], whose seven FM shadows represent about half of the national total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/contenidogeneral/industria/cuadroestadisticodedistribuciondeestacionesmarzo2016.pdf|title=IFT Table of Distribution of Stations, March 2016|author=|date=|publisher=[[Federal Telecommunications Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three more FM shadows are authorized but not in this table: [[XETIA-FM]]/[[XEAD-FM]] Ajijic, Jal. and [[XHRRR-FM (Veracruz)|XHRRR-FM]] Tecolula, Ver.

===United States===
{{update|the digital transition|date=June 2013}}

====Radio====
As of July 2009, the basic [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations on translators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2007/octqtr/47cfr74.1201.htm |title=FCC regulations CFR 47 Part 74 Subpart L: FM Broadcast Translator Stations and FM Broadcast Booster Stations |publisher=Edocket.access.gpo.gov |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* FM translators may be used for cross-band translation. This removed the restriction that prevented FM translators from retransmitting AM signals.
* No translator or booster may transmit anything other than the live [[simulcast]] of its licensed parent station, except for emergency warnings (such as [[Emergency Alert System|EAS]]), and 30 seconds per hour of fundraising.
* The parent station must [[Station identification|identify]] all of its translators and boosters between 7 and 9 a.m., 12:55 and 1:05&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 4 and 6 p.m. each broadcast day; or each must be equipped with its own automated [[Information appliance|device]] (audio or [[Frequency-shift keying]] [FSK]) for hourly identification.
* Maximum power is 250 watts ERP for a translator, and 20% of the maximum allowable ERP for the primary station's class for a booster. There is no limit on [[HAAT|height]] for fill-in translators (those that exist within the primary [[service contour]] of the primary station).
* A translator or booster must stop transmitting if the parent station's signal is lost (this helps prevent unauthorized retransmission of other stations).

There is one loophole by which programming may differ between a main station and an FM translator: an [[HD Radio]] signal may contain [[digital subchannel]]s with different programming from the main analogue channel, and a translator may operate in such a way as to broadcast programming taken from the originating station's HD2 subchannel as the translator's main analogue signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2008/080728/nerw.html#pa |title=NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush |publisher=Fybush.com |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W237DE]] (95.3, [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]) broadcasts the programming format formerly carried by WTCY (1400 AM, now [[WHGB]]), but it actually gets this signal from a [[WNNK]] (104.1 FM) HD2 digital subchannel for analogue rebroadcast at the WNNK tower site on 95.3's main signal. As such, it technically is still legally an FM repeater of an FM station, even though each signal would be heard as delivering unique content by users of standard analogue [[FM radio]] receivers.

Commercial stations may own their translators or boosters when that translator or booster exists within the primary service contour of the parent station (they can only fill in where [[terrain]] blocks the signal). In fact, boosters may only be owned by the primary station. Translators outside of a primary station's service contour cannot be owned by the primary station, nor can they receive any financial support from the primary station. Most translators operate by picking-up the signal of the main station off the air with a directional antenna and sensitive receiver, and directly retransmitting the signal. They also may not transmit in the FM "[[reserved band]]" from 88 to 92 [[MHz]], where only [[Non-commercial educational|non-commercial]] stations are allowed. Non-commercial stations may broadcast in the commercial band, however. Unlike commercial stations, they can also relay programming to translators via [[satellite]], so long as those translators are in the reserved band. Translators in the commercial band may only be fed by a direct off-the-air signal from another FM station or translator. Non-fill-in commercial band translators may not be fed by satellite, as spelled out in FCC rule 74.1231(b).&lt;ref&gt;http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2007/octqtr/pdf/47cfr74.1231.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; All stations may use any means to feed boosters.

All U.S. translator and booster stations are low-power and have a [[list of broadcast station classes|class D]] license, making them secondary to other stations (including the parent). They must accept any [[Interference (communication)|interference]] from full-power (100-watt or more on FM) stations, while not causing any of their own. Boosters must not interfere with the parent station within the [[community of license]]. Licenses are automatically renewed with that of the parent station and do not require separate applications, though each may still be challenged with a petition to deny.

FM booster stations are given the full call sign (always including an "-FM" [[suffix]], even if there is none assigned) of the parent station, plus a [[serial number]], such as [[WRIF|WXYZ-FM]]1, WXYZ-FM2, etc.

FM translator stations may use sequential numbered call signs, consisting of "K" or "W", followed by a three-digit number (201 through 300 corresponding to frequencies 88.1 to 107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz) followed by a pair of sequentially assigned letters. The format is similar to that used by numbered television translators, where the number refers to the permanent channel assignment.

As of October 2008, the largest terrestrial radio translator system in the U.S. belongs to [[KUER-FM]], the non-commercial radio outlet of the [[University of Utah]], with 33 translator stations ranging from [[Idaho]] to [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;KUER-FM on-air broadcast statement, accessed Oct. 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Television====
Unlike FM, [[Low-power broadcasting|low-power]] television stations may operate as either translators or originate their own programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2007/octqtr/47cfr74.701.htm |title=FCC regulations – US CFR 47 Part 74 Subpart G – Low Power TV, TV Translator, and TV Booster Stations |publisher=Edocket.access.gpo.gov |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translator stations in the U.S. are given call signs which begin with a "W" or "K" (respectively east or west of the [[Mississippi River]], as with regular stations), followed by a channel number, and two [[serial number|serial letter]]s for each channel (the first stations on that channel are AA, AB, AC, and so on). Television channels are always two-digit, from 02 to 51 (formerly 02 to 83); while [[FM radio]] channels are from 200 (87.9&amp;nbsp;MHz) to 300 (107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz), one every 0.2&amp;nbsp;MHz (for example, W42BD or K263AF). The presence of an X after the number in these call signs does not indicate an experimental broadcasting license as it may in other services, as all 26 letters are included in the sequence. The highest pair of letters used, {{As of|January 2011|lc=on}}, is ZS (K13ZS-D is a translator of [[KTSC (TV)|KTSC]] in [[Sargents, Colorado]]).&lt;ref name="fcc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/tvq?call=K13ZS |title=TV Query Results – Video Division (FCC) USA |publisher=Fcc.gov |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numbered translator stations (a format such as "W70ZZ") are typically low-power repeaters, often 100 watts or less on FM, and 1,000 or less on television. The former "translator band", [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] television channels [[channel 70|70]] through [[channel 83|83]], was originally occupied primarily by these low-powered translators. The combination of low power and high frequencies provided a very limited range for these broadcasts. This band was reallocated to [[cellular telephone]] services in the 1980s, with the handful of remaining transmitters from these channels moved to lower frequencies.

Full-power repeaters (such as [[WPBS-TV]]'s identical twin transmitter [[WNPI-TV]]) are normally assigned "-TV" call signs like those of any other full-power station. These "satellite stations" do not bear numbered call signs and must operate in the same manner as other full-power broadcasters. This [[simulcasting]] is generally not regulated by the FCC, except where a station's owner seeks to be exempted from requirements such as restrictions on owning multiple full-service stations in the same market, limits on overlap in coverage area between commonly owned stations or requirements that each full-service station have a local studio and a skeleton staff capable of originating programming locally. These exemptions are normally justified on the basis of "economic hardship", where a heavily rural location unable to support a full-service originating station of its own may be able to sustain a full-power rebroadcaster. Some stations (such as [[KVRR]] in [[Fargo, North Dakota]]) are actually chains of as many as four full-power transmitters, each with its own call sign and license, covering a vast but sparsely populated region.

LPTV stations may also choose a regular four-letter call sign with an "-LP" suffix (shared with [[low-power FM]] [LPFM]) for analog or "-LD" for digital, generally done only if the station originates programming. [[Class A television service|Class A television]] stations are assigned calls with "-CA" and "-CD" suffixes instead. Digital stations which use numerals get a "-D" suffix (as in W42BD-D). All of these are despite the fact most of the full-power digital television stations had their "-DT" (originally "-HD") suffixes dropped by the FCC before "-D" and "-LD" were implemented. Digital LPTV stations have their digital RF channel numbers as part of their digital call signs, which means it may be different from the [[virtual channel]] (the analog number).

Numbered broadcast translators which are moved permanently to another frequency are normally issued new call signs to reflect the updated channel assignments. The same is not true of displaced translators using another frequency temporarily under special technical authority. For instance, [[K55KD]] could retain its call sign while displaced temporarily to [[Channel 57 virtual TV stations in the United States|channel 57]] to resolve interference to [[MediaFLO]] users, while W[[Channel 81|81]]&lt;nowiki&gt;AA&lt;/nowiki&gt; would have received new calls when channel 81 was deleted from the bandplan. On the rare occasion that a station moves back to its original channel, it is given its old call sign, as they are not reused by other stations like regular call signs can be.

=====Digital transition=====
Low-power television stations are not required to simulcast a digital signal, nor were they required to shut down analog operation in June 2009 when full-power U.S. television stations had to do so.

Full-power stations used for simulcasting another station were, like other full-service television broadcasters, required to convert fully to digital in June 2009. The FCC defines these "TV satellite stations" as "full-power broadcast stations authorized under Part 73 of the Commission's rules to retransmit all or part of the programming of a parent station that is typically commonly owned." As most satellite stations operate in small or sparsely populated areas that have an insufficient economic base to support full-service operations, many were granted FCC authorization on a case-by-case basis to [[flash-cut]] from analog to digital on the same channel instead of simulcasting in both formats during the digital transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-07-1847A1.txt |title=FCC, DTV Transition – Approval of "Flash Cut" Requests, April 25, 2007 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While no current or future digital television mandates had been forced on existing low-power television stations, Congress passed legislation in 2008 funding low-power stations which went digital by the conversion date or shortly thereafter. Some low-power stations were forced to change frequency to accommodate full-power stations which moved to UHF or operated digital companion channels on UHF during the digital transition period.

By 2008, existing [[Channel 55 virtual TV stations in the United States|channel 55]] licensees (both low-power and full-power) were being encouraged to relocate early to free spectrum for Qualcomm's (now-defunct) [[MediaFLO]] transmitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phonescoop.com/news/item.php?n=1690 |title=Qualcomm Gets FCC Nod For MediaFLO Spectrum |publisher=Phone Scoop |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109183947/http://www2.phonescoop.com/news/item.php?n=1690 |archive-date=January 9, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, any remaining LPTV broadcasters on UHF channels 52 through 69 were forced onto lower channels; in many cases, transmitters on the original UHF 70–83 translator band were forced to relocate twice (channels 70–83 were lost to mobile phones in 1983; followed by channels 52–69 between 2009 and 2011).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcchicago.com/station/digitaltv/Scpecialized_TV_Stations.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028130626/http://www.nbcchicago.com/station/digitaltv/Scpecialized_TV_Stations.html |date=October 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many low-power broadcast translators also were directly affected by a parent station's conversion to digital television. Translators which received an analog over-the-air signal from a full-service television station for rebroadcast needed to convert receiving equipment in much the same way that individual viewers needed to deploy [[CECB|digital converters]]. While the signal transmitted by the repeater may remain in analog format, the uplink had to be changed. In the United States, 23% of the 4,000 licensed translators have received a US$1000 federal government subsidy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/technology/ci_11667413 Many rural TVs will go dark, not digital], David Migoya, ''[[Denver Post]]'', February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; which covers a small portion of the cost of this additional equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatfallstribune.com/article/20090201/NEWS01/902010304 Low-power rural stations will continue in analog for several more years] • RICHARD ECKE • Great Falls (Montana) Tribune • February 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Many other translators silently went [[dark (broadcasting)|dark]] after the digital transition deadline or did not apply for new channels after UHF channels 52–69 were removed from the bandplan.

Some small translators operated by direct conversion of a parent station's signal to another frequency for rebroadcast, without any other local signal processing or demodulation. For example, [[W07BA]], a 16-watt repeater for [[WSYR-TV]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/tvq?list=0&amp;facid=73114 |title=TV Query Results – Video Division (FCC) USA |publisher=Fcc.gov |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was by design a very simple piece of broadcast apparatus; it merely shifted the main station's signal from channel nine to channel seven to cover a small valley in [[Dewitt, New York|Dewitt]]. After [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital transition]], Syracuse became a [[ultra-high frequency|UHF]] island and WSYR-TV's main [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] signal became a 100&amp;nbsp;kW digital broadcast on channel 17. Therefore, there is no longer a channel 9 signal in any format available to feed the tiny repeater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.9wsyr.com/blogs/plugged_in_the_dtv_switch/archive/2008/04/04/2846869.aspx |title=Plugged In: the DTV Switch – What's all this DTV stuff, anyway?, Jeff Hartman, WSYR-TV ABC 9 Syracuse, April 2008 |publisher=Community.9wsyr.com |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516181434/http://community.9wsyr.com/blogs/plugged_in_the_dtv_switch/archive/2008/04/04/2846869.aspx |archive-date=May 16, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Translators in remote locations, where no [[electrical power distribution|commercial power]] is available, were also expected to have problems in deploying extra equipment to handle an uplink's digital conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.times-standard.com/localnews/ci_11204138 |title=Further complications loom for digital television conversion, Jessie Faulkner, Times-Standard, Eureka CA, 12 December 2008 |publisher=Times-standard.com |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many translators continue analog broadcasts (and a minority transitioned to digital themselves), some distant rural communities expected to find all local translator signals gone as a result of originating stations' transition to digital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevadabroadcasters.org/dtv-translator-status.pdf Nevada Translator Stations – Status Report for Digital Transition, Nevada Broadcasters Association, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226060205/http://www.nevadabroadcasters.org/dtv-translator-status.pdf |date=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many originating stations which were marginally available over-the-air as analog signals were irretrievably lost to digital conversion in certain locations (VHF [[Band I]] signals moving to UHF often losing the most range). This often meant that the parent station was no longer receivable over-the-air at the relay site. As an interim solution to this problem, communities that are permitted to do so by state and federal laws have chosen to purchase Ku-Band ([[Echostar Communications Corporation|Echostar]], [[Hughes Corporation|Hughes]], etc.) or C-Band satellite receivers for their translator stations: the satellite input is simply rebroadcast as their analog translator output. Retransmitting the local channels from the satellite has the same problems as if the service area residents purchased individual service themselves: signal latency, atmospheric conditions (e.g.: torrential rain or snow accumulation on the [[Low-noise block downconverter|receiving device]]), satellite equipment issues, etc.

A digital-to-digital repeater or broadcast translator is possible; in North America, the [[ATSC]] specifications allow such repeaters to leave the [[virtual channel]] numbering and guide ([[Program and System Information Protocol]] [PSIP]) of the originating station unchanged, so that the rebroadcaster appears to the viewer as if it were on the same channel numbers as the original station. Some full-power television stations that have lost coverage after the digital transition have applied for digital replacement translators to fill in the gaps in some of the station's lost coverage.&lt;ref&gt;http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-09-36A1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Those "fill-in" translators use the same call letters, suffix and facility IDs as their main full-power station.

A few local translator districts (in which one municipal or county-level group had operated multiple low-power analog retransmitters fed from multiple distant stations) consolidated all programming on [[digital subchannel]]s of a single digital television transmitter on a new channel. These rebroadcast stations insert PSIP virtual channel numbering and call signs locally.

Most digital [[television set]]s and [[digital video recorder]]s include analog and [[ATSC tuner|digital tuner]]s, however most digital television [[set-top box]]es fail to display analog stations or even to include [[analog passthrough]] for RF from the [[television antenna]] (the way a [[VCR]] does). This is an issue primarily with [[coupon-eligible converter box]]es and caused grave concern among low-power television operators and border stations; the [[Community Broadcasters Association]] filed a [[lawsuit]] claiming it violated the [[All-Channel Receiver Act]], the law on which the FCC based its digital mandate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keepuson.com/index2.php KeepUsOn.com: Community Broadcasters Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225044601/http://www.keepuson.com/index2.php |date=December 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in late 2008, 58% of approved coupon-eligible converter models were providing analog pass-through.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtv2009.gov/stats.aspx{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy====
Under U.S. law, full-service local broadcasters are the primary occupants of the [[FM radio]] broadcast band. All LPFM operations, as well as all translators, are considered to be secondary in importance. In theory, this leaves [[low-power FM]] stations and broadcast translators with co-equal status on the FM band. In practice, as the FM broadcast band becomes more crowded, frequencies assigned to translators become unavailable to new LPFM stations or to existing LPFM stations seeking to upgrade their facilities.&lt;ref name="fybush-wavm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2005/051024/nerw.html#ma|title=NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush|author=|date=|website=www.fybush.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few key distinctions often place small, local LPFM operators at a disadvantage:
* The maximum power for an LPFM station (either 10 or 100 watts, depending on class of station) is less than that of the largest FM broadcast translators (at 250 watts), limiting the reach of the LPFM signal.
* The minimum spacing required (in distance and frequency) to other stations is less strict for translators than for LPFM applicants. While the translator spacing is based on signal contour levels (and therefore takes terrain and obstacles into account), the LPFM stations have a more-restrictive legally-defined minimum distance requirement.&lt;ref name="FCC-05-75A1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-75A1.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - 47167.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An LPFM broadcaster is required to generate local content; if there are multiple applicants for the same frequency, those who agree to originate eight or more hours a day of local programming are favoured. Translators are not required to (and are not licensed to) originate anything locally.
* LPFM licenses are normally issued to non-commercial educational entities (such as schools or municipalities) and are subject to strict requirements largely precluding multiple stations under common ownership. The same is not true of translators. A non-commercial translator with no local content and no educational content is free to occupy space even in the non-commercial segment (below 92&amp;nbsp;MHz) of the U.S. FM broadcast band. During the narrow FCC filing windows for new applicants, multiple applications for broadcast translators from the same or related entities can be abused to request every locally available frequency in multiple communities.&lt;ref name="CJR"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://cjrarchives.org/issues/2006/2/Schulman.asp |title=Out of Thin Air |first=Daniel |last=Schulman |authorlink=Daniel Schulman (writer) |journal=Columbia Journalism Review |date=February 2006 |publisher=Cjrarchives.org |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DIYmedia-CJR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diymedia.net/feature/f030506.htm |title=CJR on Godcasting Invasion, DIYmedia, March 5, 2006 |publisher=Diymedia.net |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216103516/http://www.diymedia.net/feature/f030506.htm |archive-date=December 16, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An LPFM license or construction permit cannot lawfully be resold. The same is not true for translators. A few related entities can easily file applications for thousands of individual translator construction permits via automated means, using non-commercial status to gain exemption from any FCC filing fees, then resell these construction permits ''en masse'' or individually for thousands of dollars each – even if the corresponding transmitters have not yet been constructed.&lt;ref name="DIYmedia-godsquads"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diymedia.net/feature/lpfm/f022505.htm |title=God Squads Fall From Grace, DIYmedia.net, February 25, 2005 |publisher=Diymedia.net |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125121339/http://diymedia.net/feature/lpfm/f022505.htm |archive-date=January 25, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcast translators for commercial stations are normally required to receive a signal from their parent full-service FM station [[Wireless|over-the-air]] and retransmit solely within the region which should be covered by the main station (this eliminates the need for a translator except in cases where the [[terrain shielding]] is a problem). This same restriction does not apply to [[non-commercial educational]] stations. Any non-commercial station, even one with no local or educational content to offer, can apply for an unlimited number of translators anywhere to be fed by any means (including via satellite). The end result is a network of hundreds of small local transmitters, none of which broadcast (and none of which can lawfully broadcast) programming of interest to the local community.&lt;ref name="mediageek-2147"/&gt; All take increasingly scarce available spectrum which otherwise could have been employed by local LPFM stations or used for rebroadcast of local full-service stations.&lt;ref name="Alternet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/21639 |title=Right-wing Radio: Religious broadcasters are squeezing community radio right off the FM dial |author=Sarah Posner |publisher=Alternet.org |date=April 5, 2005 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related issue involves the use of full-power stations to carry [[broadcast automation|automated]] or satellite-originated programming. Any new full-service station can displace an existing low-power translator or an independent LPFM station; regulations allow this on the presumption that the full-service broadcaster would be more likely to provide a local voice to the community of license. Not all full-service broadcasters live up to this expectation. In some cases (such as the displacement of existing [[NPR|National Public Radio]] repeaters by newly created religious stations in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]]) the result has been the loss of local or educational content.&lt;ref name="newsmine"&gt;[http://newsmine.org/content.php?ol=propoganda/religious-radio-targets-npr.txt Religious stations put squeeze on NPR, Blaine Harden, ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 15, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; While an exactly opposite outcome to that which legislative intent had anticipated, often a small non-commercial educational translator was carrying content of higher quality than a satellite-fed full-power station for which it is displaced.

=====Great Translator Invasion of 2003=====
An FCC licensing window for new translator applications in 2003 resulted in over 13,000 applications being filed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioworld.com/reference-room/special-report/02_rw_fm_trans_8-09.10.03.shtml |title=RW Special Report |publisher=RadioWorld.com |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821165946/http://www.radioworld.com/reference-room/special-report/02_rw_fm_trans_8-09.10.03.shtml |archive-date=August 21, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of them coming from religious broadcasters. Due to the extremely high volume of license applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recnet.com/cdbs/fmq.php?facid=&amp;call=&amp;ccode=1&amp;latd=&amp;lond=&amp;city=&amp;state=&amp;country=US&amp;zip=&amp;party=calvary+chapel&amp;party_type=LICEN&amp;jaws=0 |title=REC Broadcast Query |publisher=Recnet.com |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; LPFM advocates describe this as the ''Great Translator Invasion''.&lt;ref name="CJR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recnet.com/traffic/ |title=REC – 'Traffick' Report – Great Translator Invasion |publisher=Recnet.com |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216105132/http://recnet.com/traffic/ |archive-date=December 16, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lpfm-gti"&gt;[http://www.lpfm.ws/news/gti.php LPFM.WS – Low Power FM – Great Translator Invasion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130142518/http://www.lpfm.ws/news/gti.php |date=January 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few broadcasters have taken advantage of FM translator regulations which allow non-commercial stations to feed distant translators from [[satellite]]-delivered programming hundreds or even thousands of miles outside the parent station's coverage area.&lt;ref name="mediageek-2147"&gt;[http://www.mediageek.org/archives/002147.html mediageek: Another Kind of Low-Power Station Hogging Radio Spectrum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006142045/http://www.mediageek.org/archives/002147.html |date=October 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is a misconception that all translators can be fed by satellites.  Only translators located on the non-commercial portion of the FM band (88.1 to 91.9&amp;nbsp;MHz) can be so-called "satellators". All other translators must be fed off the air by direct radio reception, except in the case of so-called "fill-in" facilities that exist within the service contour of a primary station. Translators may also be used to feed other translators, so it is possible to create small chains of translators all fed from one distant station, however, this only works until the chain is broken and, if any one translator fails, the entire network beyond the failed translator would go down. The high volume of application in 2003 overloaded the FCC which issued an emergency hold order on new translator applications&lt;ref name="lpfm-gti"/&gt; until those which had been received were processed; this came after considerable criticism from LPFM lobbyist groups such as Prometheus Radio.&lt;ref name="DIYmedia-godsquads"/&gt; These translator applications were all on the commercial band and none of them could be used as satellators. It is unknown how the one broadcast group with the most applications planned to deliver programming to all of the translators, but affiliated churches of the parent organization own broadcasting outlets in many of the cities.

Some [[religious broadcasting]] outlets – such as [[Calvary Chapel]]'s [[CSN International|KAWZ]] [[Twin Falls, Idaho]]; [[Educational Media Foundation]]; or [[Family Radio]]'s [[KEBR (FM)|KEBR]] [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] – are relayed by hundreds of FM "translator" stations across the U.S. As these parent stations are owned by non-profit organizations and they exist on the non-commercial part of the spectrum, they are not required to have their translators receive their signal over the air, as would be required for a commercial broadcaster.&lt;ref name="DIYmedia-godsquads"/&gt; This has been used by a number of religious broadcasters to set up large [[satellite]]-based networks composed almost entirely of "distant translators" – translators outside of the market area (generally a 50-mile radius surrounding the transmitter).

Some LPFM advocates erroneously state that the proliferation of translators has posed difficulties for non-translator station operators, in particular LPFM license applicants who claim that they cannot get stations on the air due to translators eliminating any available channels in an area.&lt;ref name="mediageek-2147"/&gt; While this may be true for future LPFM applications, it is not true for any existing LPFM broadcasters or LPFM applicants. This is because the last LPFM filing window was in 2001. All translator applications from the 2003 window were required to protect the LPFM applications already pending or authorized at that time. As a result, no LPFM station was denied due to translators.

Since so-called sat-casting translators are only permitted on the non-commercial part of the spectrum, where LPFM stations do not exist, they pose no threat to the ability of existing LPFM licensees to expand their current station facilities.&lt;ref name="fybush-wavm"/&gt; Non-sat-casting translators may present a problem for existing LPFM stations:  if the LPFM station is "bumped" from its existing channel by a new full-power station, there may be no available frequency to which to move.&lt;ref name="Alternet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recnet.com/lpfminfo/encr0205.pdf FAC: 124266 CALL: NEW CHAN: 285 CMTY: ANCHORAGE AK] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129140812/http://www.recnet.com/lpfminfo/encr0205.pdf |date=November 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freepress.net/news/7023 |title=Corporate bigfoot CSN tunes out community stations |publisher=FreePress.net |date=March 3, 2005 |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210055447/http://www.freepress.net/news/7023 |archive-date=February 10, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://72.166.46.24/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017041017/http://72.166.46.24/boston/music/other_stories/documents/03042096.asp |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}/boston/news_features/this_just_in/documents/04509192.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC has, generally, not required LPFM stations to be displaced by full power stations.

There is at least one proposed rulemaking that would revise the procedures by which nonprofit groups may apply for translators (thus disallowing more than a certain number of translator applications to be owned by any one entity); in addition, the FCC has modified channel requirements for LPFM broadcasters to open channel space.&lt;ref name="FCC-05-75A1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpfm.ws/news/99-25.php LPFM.WS – Low Power FM – powered by REC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131090841/http://www.lpfm.ws/news/99-25.php |date=January 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; REC Networks has filed a petition with the FCC that would, among other things, require the FCC to give higher priority to LPFM stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recnet.com/fcc/RM-11338.pdf |title=Before The |format=PDF |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208073111/http://www.recnet.com/fcc/RM-11338.pdf |archive-date=February 8, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest satellite-fed translator networks are endeavors linked to [[CSN International|Calvary Chapel]] (including [[Radio Assist Ministry]], Horizon Broadcasting, and (formerly) [[Edgewater Broadcasting]] and REACH Media&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediageek.org/archives/002496.html mediageek: Something Fishy in Right-Wing-Christian-Translator-land, Grabbing Spectrum away from LPFM, Maybe Profiting from the Venture?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006141922/http://www.mediageek.org/archives/002496.html |date=October 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and American Family Radio owned by the [[American Family Association]].&lt;ref name="DIYmedia-godsquads"/&gt; The multiple networks associated with Calvary Chapel have been a particular focus in regard to translator-based networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diymedia.net/feature/lpfm/f030105.htm |title=Religious Broadcasting As Franchise |publisher=DIYmedia.net |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208051521/http://www.diymedia.net/feature/lpfm/f030105.htm |archive-date=February 8, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce Wilson |url=http://www.talk2action.org/story/2006/3/7/175231/4210 |title=Talk To Action &amp;#124; Reclaiming Citizenship, History, and Faith |publisher=Talk2action.org |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, multiple applications were submitted by different companies linked to Calvary Chapel in particular for the same channel.&lt;ref name="mediageek-2147"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recnet.com/fcc/99-25-0325-reply-appA.pdf ]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recnet.com/fcc/99-25-0305-reply-appA.pdf |title=RAM-EB Activity.xls |format=PDF |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208073049/http://www.recnet.com/fcc/99-25-0305-reply-appA.pdf |archive-date=February 8, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least four separate radio stations operated by Calvary Chapel churches and relaying Calvary Satellite Network programming have been identified as "home stations" for distant translators and there are many home churches in addition to the main "national" Calvary Chapel concerns applying for licenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediageek.org/archives/002506.html Mediageek: Calvary Chapel – The Decentralized Christian Clear Channel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008014255/http://www.mediageek.org/archives/002506.html |date=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of American Family Radio in particular, there are indications of a deliberate strategy to crowd out rebroadcasters of [[National Public Radio]] stations for political purposes.&lt;ref name="newsmine"/&gt;

Educational Media Foundation, owners of the K-Love [[contemporary Christian music]] radio network, have also been cited as applying for distant translators ''en masse''. {{CN|date=November 2018}}

=====Out-of-band translators=====
{{As of|2009}}, the FCC officially sanctioned the use of FM translators for [[Crossband operation|cross-band carriage]] of AM signals. Although some feel that this poses a threat to LPFM stations, the FCC did not authorize the use of any new FM translators for this purpose and limited cross-band translation to existing translators that had already been authorized as of May 2009. Since no new translators were authorized, there is no increased threat to LPFMs from cross-band translation services. The FCC also allows translation of [[HD Radio]] digital-only channels as inputs for analog FM-only output.

=====Sale of permits=====
Some groups have sold their translator [[construction permit]]s for a large [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]; this is most obvious with the Educational Media Foundation, which has traded both translators and desired call signs with [[iHeartMedia, Inc.|iHeartMedia]] (mainly involving various forms of "LV", "KLV" or "LVE", as was done with [[WLVE]]) in exchange for HD carriage on iHeart stations of K-LOVE and Air1. Other licensees have sold their translator stations for large amounts of money – sometimes tens of thousands of dollars or more, and many times what it costs to build one.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Australia===

====Radio====
Australia's national radio networks ([[Radio National]], [[ABC NewsRadio]], [[Triple J]], [[ABC Classic FM]] and [[SBS Radio]]) each have relay transmitters which allow each service to be broadcast as widely as possible. In order to provide this, the ABC and SBS both allow community-based relay transmitters to rebroadcast radio or television in areas which would otherwise have no service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/reception/services/selfhelp.htm |title=Self-Help Guide to Rebroadcasting – ABC Reception Advice |publisher=ABC |location=Australia |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial radio broadcasters normally have relay transmitters only if the local geography (such as mountainous terrain) prevents them from broadcasting to their entire market.

====Television====
Since market aggregation in the early 1990s, each television broadcaster transmits its service using multiple relays in order provide the same service throughout Australia's large market areas. While each market is often divided into submarkets due to the legacy of previous commercial broadcasts (for example, [[Southern Cross Nine]] maintains two separate stations in the single Victoria market, [[GLV/BCV|GLV and BCV]]), the only difference between these submarkets in practice is limited to news services or local advertising. Except in major cities, all major television broadcasters use the same network of transmitters, which may have dozens of relay stations in each market. As a result, some areas have had trouble starting [[Digital terrestrial television in Australia|digital]] or [[High-definition television|HD]] services due to problems with certain regional transmitters.

===Europe===
Because most radio and television systems in Europe are national networks, the entire radio or television system in some countries can be considered a collection of relay stations, in which each broadcaster uses a transmitter network (either developed by the public broadcaster or maintained through a government-funded authority) to provide broadcast services to the entire nation.

===Asia===
In most parts of Asia, satellite is the preferred method of getting national signal coverage in most countries (notable exceptions include Singapore, which outright bans civilian ownership of satellite receivers, and Malaysia, which only allows civilian ownership of receivers provided by [[Astro (Malaysian satellite television)|Astro]]). However, terrestrial-wise, the scenario is much like that of Europe – the systems are considered national networks and comprise a collection of relay stations, maintained by a government-funded authority. This is not the case in Japan, where television stations are either owned-and-operated by the networks or are affiliates owned by other media companies.

'''''Carpenter v. United States''''', {{ussc|volume=585|page=____|year=2018|docket=16-402|el=no}}, was a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case concerning the privacy of historical [[cellphone]] location records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/supreme-court-says-warrant-necessary-for-phone-location-data/|title=Supreme Court says warrant necessary for phone location data in win for Privacy|last=Ng|first=Alfred|date=June 22, 2018|work=cnet.com|access-date=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held, in a 5–4 decision authored by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts|Roberts]], that the government violates the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] by accessing historical records containing the physical locations of [[cellphone]]s without a [[search warrant]].

Prior to ''Carpenter'', government entities could obtain [[cellphone]] location records by claiming the information was required as part of an investigation. After ''Carpenter'', government entities must obtain a warrant in order to access the information. The decision overturned portions of [[20th century]] legislation and case law when nearly all US homes had [[landline]] phones in favor of constitutional rights stemming from technological advances of cellphones in the early [[21st century]]. The ruling was very narrow and did not otherwise change the [[third-party doctrine]] related to other business records that might incidentally reveal location information, nor overrule prior decisions concerning conventional surveillance techniques and tools such as security cameras. The Court did not expand its ruling on other matters related to cellphones not presented in ''Carpenter'', including real-time [[cell site location information]] (CSLI) or "[[tower dumps]]" (a download of information about all the devices that connected to a particular cell site during a particular interval). The opinion also did not consider other collection techniques involving foreign affairs or national security.

== Legal and technical background ==
=== Cell site location information (CSLI) === 
Third-party wireless service providers (such as [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]], [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]], and [[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]]) are able to find the location of cell phones through either global positioning system (GPS) data or cell site location information (CSLI). CSLI is cell phone information captured by nearby [[cell site|cell towers]]; and this information is able to [[triangulation|triangulate]], or pinpoint, the location of cell phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2016-06-07_Cell-Tracking-Primer_Final.pdf|title=Cell Phone Location Tracking|author=National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers|date= June 7, 2016|website= law.berkeley.edu|access-date= June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-party service providers capture and store this data for business purposes, such as troubleshooting, maximizing network efficiencies and to determining whether to charge customers roaming fees for particular calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/06/justices-tackle-cellphone-data-case-next-term |title= Justices to tackle cellphone data case next term|last=Howe |first=Amy |date= June 5, 2017 |website=SCOTUSblog|access-date= June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data can also provide the historical movements of a cellphone. Thus, anyone with access to this data has the ability to know where the phone has been and what other cell phones were in the same area at a given time.  Assuming cell phone owners travel with their cellphones, this data can theoretically provide every place a person has traveled and nearly everyone the person met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/big-brother-gets-little-smaller-cell-phone-privacy-ruling-n885931|title=Big brother gets a little smaller with cellphone privacy ruling|author=Jon Schuppe |date= June 22, 2018|website=NBCnews.com|access-date= June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison between an order for disclosure and a search warrant === 
In ''Carpenter'', the Supreme Court determined what type of legal authorization is required by a government entity in order to compel third-party wireless service providers to turn over historical records containing the physical locations of [[cellphone]]s. Attorneys for Carpenter argued that the authorization should be a search warrant. Attorneys for the United States argued that the authorization should be a court order for disclosure. Requirements to obtain an "order for disclosure" are less stringent than the requirements to obtain a warrant.  
*'''Court order for disclosure''': An order for disclosure is a type of [[court order]] typically instructing a [[Third-party source|third party]] to turn over information in its possession related to an [[Criminal investigation|investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Nancy K. [https://scholarworks.law.ubalt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1940&amp;context=ublr "Location, Location, Location: Balancing Crime Fighting Needs and Privacy Rights."] U. Balt. L. Rev. 42 (2012): 485, 490-491&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain an order for disclosure from a court, a governmental entity must provide specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.  Government entities are not required to show probable cause to obtain an order for disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Search warrant''': Under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], people have the right to be free from unreasonable searches of their "persons, houses, papers, and effects" unless the government entity obtains a search warrant.  To obtain a search warrant, the government entity must show probable cause exists.  [[Probable cause]] to search exists when facts and circumstances known to the government entity provide the basis for a reasonable person to believe that a crime was committed and the items to be searched are relevant to the crime.

=== Third-party doctrine ===
Prior to ''Carpenter'', the Supreme Court consistently held that a person had no legitimate expectation of privacy in regards to information voluntarily turned over to third parties, and therefore a search warrant was not required to obtain this information. This legal theory is known as the [[third-party doctrine]], established by the Supreme Court cases ''[[United States v. Miller (1976)|United States v. Miller]]'' (1976), which determined that bank records were not subject to expectation of privacy, and ''[[Smith v. Maryland]]'' (1979), which determined the rights of individuals with regards to phone communications &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-third-party-doctrine/282721/|title=What You Need to Know about the Third-Party Doctrine|author=John Villasenor|date=December 30, 2013|website= theatlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|access-date=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3033726127475530815 |title=''Smith v.

In particular, ''Smith'' was a landmark decision by the Court and has guided the federal courts ever since on questions related to privacy and phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2017-06-05/supreme-court-accepts-major-cellphone-privacy-case |title=Major Cellphone Privacy Case Accepted by Supreme Court|author=Steven Nelson|date= June 5, 2017|website= www.usnews.com |publisher= US News and World Report |access-date= June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=October 2018}} The Court held in ''Smith'' that the government may not eavesdrop on a phone call, even a one placed from a public phone booth; however, the phone numbers the person dialed on his phone could be obtained without a warrant. The Court also determined that the Fourth Amendment does not protect the public from allowing the government to obtain the information necessary to get communications from point A to point B. For example, without a warrant the government could obtain from a letter or package the sender, receiver, originating and delivery addresses, package size, and weight; however, the government was required to obtain a warrant before opening the package or letter to obtain its contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/06/05/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-carpenter-v-united-states-the-fourth-amendment-historical-cell-site-case|title=Supreme Court agrees to hear 'Carpenter v.

=== The Stored Communications Act ===
In 1986, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Stored Communications Act]] ([[codification (law)|codified]] at [[Title 18 of the United States Code|18 USC]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-121 Chapter 121] §§&amp;nbsp;2701–2712), which governs the privacy of stored Internet communications in the United States. The Act protects the personal information that is stored by certain providers, such as electronic communication and remote computing service providers. It prohibits these service providers "from knowingly disclosing the contents of customers’ electronic communications or subscriber records,",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.fiu.edu/stored-communications-act/|title=Stored Communications Act: Roadblock to Discovery - Law|last=Aleman|first=Kevin|date=April 22, 2015|website=law.fiu.edu|language=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but "a provider is required to disclose the information to a U.S. government agent or agency," if they obtain a warrant first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.emdenlaw.com/stored-communications-act-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/|title=Stored Communications Act: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly|last=Kushner|first=Maya|date=September 9, 2015|work=Emden Law Firm|access-date=May 30, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Section 2703 [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703 (18 USC §&amp;nbsp;2703)] provides the rules that the government must follow in order to compel a third-party [[service provider]] to disclose "customer or subscriber" content and non-content information.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Orin S.

Rev. 72 (2003): 1208&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to passage of the Stored Communications Act, many courts were reluctant to issue orders for disclosure that allowed the government to obtain data held by third parties; but section (d) of this act required a judge to issue a court order for disclosure whenever the federal government showed that the requested information was relevant to a criminal investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public adoption of smartphone technology === 
In the 2010’s, cellphones, particularly [[smartphone]]s, had become an important instrument for nearly every person in the United States. By 2016, over 95% of Americans owned a cellphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/mobile/ |title= Mobile Fact Sheet |date= February 5, 2018 |website=Pew Research Center Internet and Technology|publisher= Pew Research Center |access-date=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many applications, such as [[GPS]] navigation and location tools, required the cellphone to send and receive information constantly, including the exact location of the cellphone. 
As technology advanced in the 21st Century, the Court began to back away from its 20th Century third-party doctrine. In 2014, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in ''[[Riley v. California]]'' that the warrantless search and seizure of digital contents of a cellphone during an arrest is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9647156672357738355 |title= ''Riley v. California'', 134 S. Ct. 2473 (2014)|website= Scholar.google.com|accessdate= 2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its decision, the Court recognized that the public's adoption of cellphones, combined with their capacity to hold vast quantities of detailed personal information, makes them vastly different from the old analog phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/06/tracking-changes|title=The Supreme Court will consider a mobile phone privacy case |date= June 9, 2017|journal= The Economist |access-date= June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Court ruled in ''[[United States v. Jones]]'' that the government is prohibited from entering private property to attach a GPS tracker to a suspect’s car without a valid warrant. Foreshadowing ''Carpenter'', Justice Sotomayor used her concurrence in ''Jones'' to express her discomfort with the third-party doctrine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;More fundamentally, it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. This approach is ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6122276400056758151 |title= ''United States v. Jones'', 132 S. Ct. 945, 957 (2012)|website= Scholar.google.com|accessdate= 2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Case background ==

=== Facts of the case ===

Between December 2010 and March 2011, several individuals in the [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], area conspired and participated in armed robberies at [[RadioShack]] and [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] stores in [[Michigan]] and [[Ohio]]. When the robbers entered the store, they brandished their guns, ordered customers and employees to the back of the store, and told the employees to fill their bags with new smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/16-402-BIO.pdf|title=Brief of respondent United States in opposition|website= scotusblog.com|accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, four of the robbers were captured and arrested. (The petitioner, Timothy Carpenter, was not among the group of arrestees.) One of those arrested confessed and turned over his phone so that [[FBI]] agents could review the calls made from his phone around the time of the robberies. Soon afterwards, a [[United States magistrate judge|magistrate judge]], in accordance with the [[Stored Communications Act]], granted the FBI's request to obtain "transactional records" from various wireless carriers for 16 different phone numbers for "[a]ll subscriber information, toll records and call detail records including listed and unlisted numbers dialed or otherwise transmitted to and from [the] target telephones... as well as cell site information for the target telephones at call origination and at call termination for incoming and outgoing calls[.]" The government was able to obtain a court order before gaining access to the information; prosecutors only had to show that they were seeking evidence relevant to a criminal investigation. Getting a [[warrant (law)|search warrant]] requires the government to prove probable cause which is harder to obtain because it requires more specific information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/2017/11/29/567348000/justices-may-impose-new-limits-on-government-access-to-cellphone-data|title=Justices May Impose New Limits On Government Access To Cellphone Data|author=Nina Totenberg |date=November 29, 2017|website= npr.org|publisher=NPR Services|access-date= May 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 16 different phone numbers called or received by the confessed robber around the time of the robberies were not sufficient evidence to establish probable cause; however, it was sufficient evidence under the Stored Communications Act, which requires only "that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/supreme-court-reenters-fray-privacy-carpenter-v-united-states |title=Supreme Court Reenters Fray on Privacy: Carpenter v. United States  |author=Laura E. Jehl |date= June 9, 2017|website= natlawreview.com|publisher= The National Law Review|access-date= June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the historical cell-site records, the government was able to determine that Carpenter's cellphone communicated with cell towers at the time and from this information, the government was able to determine that Carpenter was within a two-mile radius of four robberies. Using this information, the government charged and arrested Carpenter. A jury later convicted Carpenter on several counts of aiding and abetting a robbery that affected interstate commerce and another count of aiding and abetting the use or carriage of a firearm during a federal crime of violence. Carpenter was sentenced by Judge [[Sean Cox]] of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]] to 1395 months, or 116.25 years, in [[federal prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14626167511079628834 |title=''United States v. Carpenter'', 819 F. 3d 880, 885 (6th Cir. 2016)|website= Scholar.google.com|accessdate= 2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appeal before the Sixth Circuit ===

Carpenter appealed his conviction and sentence to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]]. A three-judge panel heard the case on October 14, 2015.  On April 13, 2016, Judge [[Raymond Kethledge]] delivered the opinion of the Court, affirming Carpenter's conviction and sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14626167511079628834 |title=''United States v. Carpenter'', 819 F. 3d 880 (6th Cir. 2016)|website= Scholar.google.com|accessdate= 2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sixth Circuit relied on the Supreme Court's guidance from the Supreme Court's 1979 decision in ''[[Smith v. Maryland]]'' to clarify that only the content of a person's communication is protected by the Fourth Amendment. The Court explained that "cell-site data — like mailing addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses — are information that facilitate personal communications, rather than part of the content of those communications themselves."  Furthermore, the Court determined that the government obtained information from not Carpenter but the service provider's business records.  Therefore, the government's collection of the service provider's business records did not constitute a "search" of Carpenter under the Fourth Amendment and so did not require a warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14626167511079628834 |title=''United States v. Carpenter'', 819 F. 3d 880, 890 (6th Cir. (2016)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Jane Branstetter Stranch]] dissented from the majority's conclusion that the collection of the service provider's business records did not constitute a search.  In her dissent, Judge Stranch states, "this case involves tracking physical location through cell towers and a personal phone, a device routinely carried on the individual's person; it also involves the compelled provision of records that reflect such tracking. In light of the personal tracking concerns articulated in our precedent, I am not convinced that the situation before us can be addressed appropriately with a test primarily used to obtain business records such as credit card purchases — records that do not necessarily reflect personal location. And it seems to me that the business records test is ill suited to address the issues regarding personal location that are before us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14626167511079628834 |title=''United States v.

==Supreme Court decision==
=== Majority opinion ===
The Court issued its decision on June 22, 2018, with the court split 5–4. [[John Roberts|Chief Justice Roberts]] wrote the [[majority opinion]]. Associate Justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]], [[Sonia Sotomayor|Sotomayor]], and [[Elena Kagan|Kagan]] joined Roberts' opinion. The majority determined that the third-party doctrine applied to telephone communications in ''[[Smith v. Maryland]]'' could not be applied to cellphone technology and ruled that the government must obtain a warrant in order to access historical cellphone records. Roberts argued that technology "has afforded law enforcement a powerful new tool to carry out its important responsibilities. At the same time, this tool risks Government encroachment of the sort the Framers [of the US Constitution], after consulting the lessons of history, drafted the Fourth Amendment to prevent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-402_h315.pdf| title=''United States v. Carpenter'', 585 U.S. ___ Slip op. at 22 (2018)|website= supremecourt.gov|accessdate= 2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority adds,

&lt;blockquote&gt;[S]eismic shifts in digital technology [] made possible the tracking of not only Carpenter’s location but also everyone else’s, not for a short period but for years and years. Sprint Corporation and its competitors are not your typical witnesses. Unlike the nosy neighbor who keeps an eye on comings and goings, they are ever alert, and their memory is nearly infallible. There is a world of difference between the limited types of personal information addressed in ''Smith'' and ''Miller'' and the exhaustive chronicle of location information casually collected by wireless carriers today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-402_h315.pdf| title=''United States v. Carpenter'', 585 U.S. ___ Slip op. at 15 (2018)|website= supremecourt.gov|accessdate= 2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Roberts's opinion reasoned that the "detailed, encyclopedic, and effortlessly compiled" data used in tracking of a person by cell towers was qualitatively similar to that of using a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) tracking device as determined by ''Jones''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/us/politics/supreme-court-warrants-cell-phone-privacy.html | title =  Defending Privacy, Supreme Court Says Warrants Generally Are Necessary to Collect Cell Phone Data | first=  Adam | last = Liptak | date = June 22, 2018 | accessdate = June 22, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts stressed that the decision is a very narrow ruling; it does not affect other parts of the third-party doctrine, such as banking records, nor does it prevent collection of cell tower data without a warrant in emergencies or for national security issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.npr.org/2018/06/22/605007387/supreme-court-rules-police-need-warrant-to-get-location-information-from-cell-to |title =In Major Privacy Win, Supreme Court Rules Police Need Warrant To Track Your Cellphone |first = Nina |last = Totenburg | date = June 22, 2018 |accessdate = June 22, 2018 |work =[[NPR]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dissenting opinions ===
Justices [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]], [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]], [[Samuel A. Alito|Alito]], and [[Neil Gorsuch|Gorsuch]] each wrote [[dissenting opinion]]s. Kennedy's dissent cautioned against the limitation on law enforcement, writing, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;This case involves new technology, but the Court’s stark departure from relevant Fourth Amendment precedents and principles is, in my submission, unnecessary and incorrect, requiring this respectful dissent. The new rule the Court seems to formulate puts needed, reasonable, accepted, lawful, and congressionally authorized criminal investigations at serious risk in serious cases, often when law enforcement seeks to prevent the threat of violent crimes. And it places undue restrictions on the lawful and necessary enforcement powers exercised not only by the Federal Government, but also by law enforcement in every State and locality throughout the Nation. Adherence to this Court’s longstanding precedents and analytic framework would have been the proper and prudent way to resolve this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-402_h315.pdf| title=''United States v. Carpenter'', 585 U.S. ___ (Kennedy, J. dissenting) Slip op. at 1 (2018)|website= supremecourt.gov|accessdate= 2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alito wrote in his dissent,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I share the Court’s concern about the effect of new technology on personal privacy, but I fear that today’s decision will do far more harm than good. The Court’s reasoning fractures two fundamental pillars of Fourth Amendment law, and in doing so, it guarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-402_h315.pdf| title=''United States v. Carpenter'', 585 U.S. ___ (Alito, J. dissenting) Slip op. at 1 (2018)|website= supremecourt.gov|accessdate= 2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Gorsuch also wrote a dissent, his opinion is similar to a [[concurring opinion]] because he agreed with the majority’s decision but disagreed with the majority’s reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://reason.com/blog/2018/06/22/neil-gorsuch-joins-sonia-sotomayor-in-qu|title=Neil Gorsuch Joins Sonia Sotomayor in Questioning the Third-Party Doctrine |date=June 22, 2018|website=reason.com|publisher=Reason Foundation|access-date=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorsuch agreed that law enforcement agencies need a warrant to obtain cell phone data; however, he disagreed that the Fourth Amendment provides the right to a "reasonable expectation of privacy."  Instead, Gorsuch argues that cell phone location records are the property of cell phone owners, and, under the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement agencies cannot search a person’s property without a warrant.  
In 1967, the Supreme Court first suggested in ''[[Katz v. United States]]'' that the Fourth Amendment provides the right to a "reasonable expectation of privacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9210492700696416594|title=''Katz v. United States'', 389 U. S. 347, 361 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorsuch believes ''Katz'' was incorrectly decided because the [[originalism|original meaning]] of the Fourth Amendment does not provide for a "reasonable expectation of privacy." Instead, Gorsuch writes that the Fourth Amendment "grants you the right to invoke its guarantees whenever one of your protected things (your person, your house, your papers, or your effects) is unreasonably searched or seized. Period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-402_h315.pdf| title=''United States v. Carpenter'', 585 U.S. ___ (Gorsuch, J. dissenting) Slip op. at 6 (2018)|website= supremecourt.gov|accessdate= 2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he argues that historical cell record data is the property of cell phone owners and cannot be searched without a warrant. Gorsuch also advocates that the Court should overturn the "reasonable expectation of privacy" doctrine suggested in ''Katz'', as well as the "third-party doctrine" established in ''Smith'' and ''Miller'' because they are not consistent with the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment and lead to confusion and inconsistencies in the lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-402_h315.pdf| title=''United States v.

In [[drama]] and other art forms, the '''central conceit''' of a work of fiction is the underlying fictitious assumption which must be accepted by the audience with [[suspension of disbelief]] so the [[Plot (narrative) |plot]] may be seen as plausible. &lt;!-- content moved from [[Conceit]], may be usable here: For later literature and film, the term is sometimes used to refer to a [[Literary technique|device]] that stretches reality to take advantage of what [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] called the "willing [[suspension of disbelief]]." This usage is seldom seen in formal literary criticism. --&gt;

An example from popular culture is the way many cartoons feature animals that can speak to each other, and in many cases can understand human speech, but humans cannot understand the speech of animals. This conceit is seen, and sometimes exploited for plot purposes, in such films as ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', the ''[[Balto (film)|Balto]]'' series, and ''[[Brother Bear]]''.

'''''Chrome Dreams II''''' is the 28th studio album by Canadian musician [[Neil Young]]. The album was released on October 23, 2007 as a double LP and as a single CD. The album is a sequel to ''[[Chrome Dreams]]'', a legendary Neil Young album from 1977 that had originally been scheduled for release but was shelved in favor of ''[[American Stars 'N Bars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neilyoung.com/news/index.html |title=Neil Young Times |publisher=Neilyoung.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201092807/http://www.neilyoung.com/news/index.html |archive-date=2007-12-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album debuted on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart at number 11, selling about 54,000 copies in its first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1047534/underwood-leads-three-country-debuts-onto-chart | title= Underwood Leads Three Country Debuts Onto Chart | accessdate= 2007-11-28 | last= Hasty | first= Katie | date= 2007-10-31 | publisher= Billboard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the song "No Hidden Path" was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance]] at the 51st Grammy Awards, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiss |first=Dan |url=http://www.spin.com/2009/02/its-not-your-parents-grammy-awards-or-it/ |title=It’s Not Your Parents’ Grammy Awards — Or Is It? |publisher=SPIN |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''Chrome Dreams II'' was produced by The Volume Dealers (Neil Young &amp; [[Niko Bolas]]), and features the ensemble of [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]] drummer [[Ralph Molina]], pedal steel guitarist and dobro player [[Ben Keith]] (''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'', ''[[Comes A Time]]'', ''[[Harvest Moon (album)|Harvest Moon]]'') and bassist [[Rick Rosas]] (''[[Freedom (Neil Young album)|Freedom]]'', ''[[Living With War]]'', ''[[This Note's for You]]''). A horn section, The Blue Note Horns, appear on one track, "Ordinary People," while the [[Young People’s Chorus of New York City]] appear on "The Way." Most of the recording was done live with few overdubs at Feelgood's Garage studio near Redwood City, California, with two vintage gas pumps out front and vintage studio gear inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://bad-news-beat.org/ | title= Neil Young - Chrome Dreams II. and Live Archives coming up - Ordinary People | accessdate= 2007-11-28 | publisher= Bad News Beat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Young, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's an album with a form based on some of my original recordings, with a large variety of songs, rather than one specific type of song. Where ''[[Living with War]]'' and ''[[Everybody's Rockin']]'' were albums focused on one subject or style, ''Chrome Dreams II'' is more like ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' or ''Freedom'', with different types of songs working together to form a feeling. Now that radio formats are not as influential as they once were, it's easier to release an album that crosses all formats with a message that runs through the whole thing, regardless of the type of song or sound. Some early listeners have said that this album is positive and spiritual. I like to think it focuses on the human condition. Like many of my recordings, this one draws on earlier material here and there. I used to do that a lot back in the day. Some songs, like 'Ordinary People,' need to wait for the right time. I think now is the right time for that song and it lives well with the new songs I have written in the past few months. I had a blast making this music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/070823/0294131.html | title= New Neil Young Album: "Chrome Dreams II" Set for Release October 16th | accessdate= 2007-11-28 | publisher= Warner Bros. Records}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first three songs of ''Chrome Dreams II'' date from the 1980s. "Beautiful Bluebird" was first recorded for the original version of ''[[Old Ways]]'' that was shelved by Geffen Records; "Boxcar" was a track on the unreleased ''Times Square'' album, which was scrapped in favor of the more commercially viable ''[[Freedom (Neil Young album)|Freedom]]''; and "Ordinary People," which was recorded in summer 1988 for what became the ''[[Freedom (Neil Young album)|Freedom]]'' album, was highly regarded as one of Young's greatest unreleased songs, and was often played live during the "Sponsored By Nobody" tour with The Bluenotes to promote the album. This was the album's first single, and was sent to radio on Monday, September 10. The length of this track (clocking in at 18:13) makes it hard to program into today's limited radio playlists, so it was initially heard on radio web sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://neilyoung.com/news/index.html | title= Ordinary People to Radio | accessdate= 2007-11-28 | publisher= NY Times | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071201092807/http://www.neilyoung.com/news/index.html | archive-date= 2007-12-01 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cite du vin Bordeaux 2017 (37500642606).jpg|alt=Cité du Vin|thumb|Cité du Vin]]

== Construction ==
The cost of the construction has been underestimated. In January 2011, the cost of the construction had been estimated at 63 million euros excluding taxes.&lt;ref name=lemoniteur&gt;{{cite web |language=fr|date = 2 December 2014|title = Cité des civilisations du vin : un surcoût compensé par les retombées attendues|url = http://www.lemoniteur.fr/article/cite-des-civilisations-du-vin-un-surcout-compense-par-les-retombees-attendues-26571768|website=lemoniteur.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; But at the end of 2014, as the construction was in progress, the cost of the structure has been re-evaluated to reach 81,1 million euros excluding taxes.&lt;ref name=lemoniteur /&gt;

== Opening ==
Its official opening by the [[President of France]] [[François Hollande]] and [[Alain Juppé]] took place on May 31, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=fr|date = 6 February 2016|title = L'entrée à 20 euros : tout ce qu'il faut savoir sur la Cité du vin de Bordeaux|url = http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/06/l-entree-a-20-euros-tout-ce-qu-il-faut-savoir-sur-la-cite-du-vin-de-bordeaux-2266324-6044.php|website=sudouest.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
The Cité du Vin is accessible by tram (Line B which connects Berges de la Garonne to Pessac Center and France Alouette), by the ring road, by the Chaban-Delmas bridge and by lines 7 and 32 of the TBM network. A stop of the Batcub is located nearby.

Pictures]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s by [[DC Comics]]. The shared universe, much like the original [[DC Universe]] in comic books and the [[Arrowverse|television programs]], was established by [[fictional crossover|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed five films. The series has grossed over $3.7 billion at the global box office, currently making it the [[List of highest-grossing franchises and film series|fourteenth highest-grossing film franchise]].

The films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]], casts. Several actors, including [[Henry Cavill]], [[Amy Adams]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Jason Momoa]], and [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]], have appeared in numerous films of the franchise, with continued appearances in sequels planned. In May 2016, DC's [[chief creative officer]] [[Geoff Johns]] and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg were appointed to co-run the [[DC Films]] division and oversee creative decisions, production and [[Story arc|story-arcs]] in order to create a cohesive overarching plot within the films.

== Additional materials ==

[[File:BvS Communion Scene Steppenwolf.png|thumb|right|The "Communion" scene in ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'' teases the events in ''Justice League'', showing the villain [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]] and the three [[Mother Box]]es.]]

In order to expand and build the universe the films are set in, some additional material has been released, such as additional scenes or bonus material included in the home releases of the films. The purpose of said material is also to set up and tease the overarching narrative that future installments of the franchise will adhere to. In the case of additional scenes, on March 28, 2016, Warner Bros. released to the public via its YouTube channel, a scene not shown in theaters from ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'', titled "Communion", which teased the events that would be depicted in ''Justice League''; the scene was later integrated in the Ultimate Edition home release of the film. Similarly, in the Blu-ray disc home release of ''Wonder Woman'', an epilogue is included in the form of a [[short film|short]] titled "Etta's Mission", which details a final incident that transpired after the events of the film. Etta teases the existence of a Mother Box, which is crucial to the storyline of ''Justice League''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Brian Jacks |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1697329/how-the-new-wonder-woman-epilogue-will-connect-to-justice-league |title=How The New Wonder Woman Epilogue Will Connect To Justice League |website=Cinemablend.com |accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the Blu-ray home release of ''Justice League'', two additional scenes not shown in the theatrical cut are included, which further flesh-out the return of Superman and him joining the League.

Furthermore, the various special featurettes and documentaries included in the Blu-ray home releases of the films feature concept arts and designs, as well as background information that greatly expands the shared universe; giving detailed insight into the fictional history, technology, worlds and cultures that appear in the films.

Although not all the films in the franchise resort to this practice, some of them make use of [[post-credits scene]]s to further develop character relationships and establish the plot elements that will influence future installments, such as ''Suicide Squad'' and ''Justice League''.

'''Dance-pop''' is a [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Dance music|dance]] subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally uptempo music intended for [[nightclub]]s with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for [[contemporary hit radio]]. Developing from a combination of [[electronic dance music]] and [[pop music]], with influences of [[disco]],&lt;ref name=AMDancePop/&gt; [[post-disco]]&lt;ref name="post"&gt;Smay, David &amp; Cooper, Kim (2001). ''Bubblegum Music Is the Naked Truth: The Dark History of Prepubescent Pop, from the Banana Splits to Britney Spears'': "... think about Stock-Aitken-Waterman and Kylie Minogue. Dance pop, that's what they call it now — Post-Disco, post-new wave and incorporating elements of both." Feral House: Publisher, p. 327. {{ISBN|0-922915-69-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[synth-pop]],&lt;ref name="apell423"/&gt; it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures&lt;ref name=AMDancePop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/dance-pop-ma0000004548|title=Dance-pop|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|date=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes.&lt;ref name=AMDancePop/&gt; The genre, on the whole, tends to be [[music producer|producer-driven]], despite some notable exceptions.&lt;ref name=AMDancePop/&gt;

Dance-pop borrowed influences from other genres, which varied by producer, artist and period. Such include [[contemporary R&amp;B]], [[House music|house]], [[Trance music|trance]], [[techno]], [[new jack swing]], [[funk]], [[synthpop]], [[electropop]] and some forms of [[Europop]].

Dance-pop is a popular mainstream style of music and there have been numerous pop artists and groups who perform in the genre. Notable ones include  [[Cher]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Spice Girls]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[NSYNC]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Rihanna]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Selena Gomez]] and [[Taylor Swift]].

===1980s===
As the term "disco" started to go out of fashion by the late 1970s to early 1980s, other terms were commonly used to describe disco-based music, such as "post-disco", "club", "dance" or "dance-pop" music.&lt;ref name=AMDancePop/&gt; These genres were, in essence, a more modern variant of disco music known as [[post-disco]], which tended to be more experimental, [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[Music producer|producer]]/[[DJ]]-driven, often using [[Music sequencer|sequencer]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.

Dance-pop music emerged in the 1980s as a combination of dance and pop, or post-disco, which was uptempo and simple, club-natured, producer-driven and catchy. Dance-pop was more uptempo and dancey than regular pop, yet more structured and less free-form than dance music, usually combining pop's easy structure and catchy tunes with dance's strong beat and uptempo nature. Dance-pop music was usually created, composed and produced by record producers who would then hire [[singer]]s to perform the songs.

In the beginning of the 1980s, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop. According to prominent [[Allmusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music, utilizing her charisma, chutzpah and sex appeal. Erlewine claimed that Madonna "launched dance-pop" and set the standard for the genre for the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. Madonna (Madonna album) at AllMusic. Retrieved September 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As the primary songwriter on her self-titled debut album and a co-producer by her third record, Madonna's insistence on being involved in all creative aspects of her work was highly unusual for a female dance-pop vocalist at the time. The staff of ''Vice'' magazine stated that her debut album "drew the blueprint for future dance-pop."&lt;ref&gt;"The 99 Greatest Dance Albums of All Time". Vice. July 14, 2015. Retrieved May 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, dance-pop was closely aligned to other uptempo electronic genres, such as [[Hi-NRG]]. Prominent producers in the 1980s included [[Stock, Aitken and Waterman]], who created Hi-NRG/dance-pop for artists such as [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]] and [[Bananarama]]. During the decade, dance-pop borrowed influences from [[funk]] (e.g. [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Whitney Houston]]), [[new jack swing]] (e.g. [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Paula Abdul]]), and [[contemporary R&amp;B]].

Other prominent dance-pop artists and groups of the 1980s included the [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[Mel and Kim]], [[Samantha Fox]], [[Debbie Gibson]], and [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]].

===1990s===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}

By the 1990s, dance-pop had become a major genre in popular music. Several dance-pop groups and artists emerged during the 1990s, such as the [[Spice Girls]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Backstreet Boys]], and [['NSYNC]]. During the early 1990s, dance-pop borrowed influences from [[house music]] (e.g. [[Right Said Fred]]'s "[[I'm Too Sexy]]", [[Taylor Dayne]]'s ''[[Soul Dancing]]'', and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]", "[[Rescue Me (Madonna song)|Rescue Me]]" and "[[Deeper and Deeper]]"), as well as [[contemporary R&amp;B]] and [[new jack swing]] (e.g. [[Shanice]]'s "[[I Love Your Smile]]").

By the late 1990s, [[electronic music|electronic]] influences became evident in dance-pop music; Madonna's critically acclaimed and commercially successful album ''[[Ray of Light]]'' (1998) incorporated [[techno]], [[trance music|trance]] and other forms of electronic dance music, bringing [[electronica]] into mainstream dance-pop. Additionally, also in 1998, [[Cher]] released a dance-pop song called "[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]" which made usage of a technological innovation of the time, [[Auto-Tune]]. An [[audio processor]] and a form of pitch modification software, Auto-Tune is commonly used as a way to correct pitch and to create special effects. Since the late 1990s, the use of Auto-Tune processing has become a common feature of dance-pop music.

[[Celine Dion]] also released a midtempo dance-pop song, "[[That's the Way It Is (Celine Dion song)|That's the Way It Is]]" by the end of 1999.

===2000s===
[[File:Kylie Minogue Cropped Sliver Spoon Awards 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Kylie Minogue]], a popular and successful dance-pop artist from the late-1980s until the early-2010s]]

At the beginning of the 2000s, dance-pop music was still prominent, and highly electronic in style, influenced by genres such as trance, house, techno and [[electro (music)|electro]]. Nonetheless, as R&amp;B and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] became extremely popular from the early part of the decade onwards, dance-pop often borrowed a lot of its influences from [[urban contemporary|urban]] music. Dance-pop stars from the 1980s and 1990s such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Madonna, Janet Jackson and Kylie Minogue continued to achieve success at the beginning of the decade. Whilst a lot of dance-pop at the time was R&amp;B-influenced, many records started to return to their [[disco]] roots; Kylie Minogue's albums such as ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]'' (2000) and ''[[Fever (Kylie Minogue album)|Fever]]'' (2001) contained influences of disco music, or a new 21st-century version of the genre known as [[nu-disco]]; hit singles such as "[[Spinning Around]]" (2000) and "[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]" (2001) also contained disco traces.&lt;ref name=AMDancePop/&gt; In Madonna's case, her album ''[[Music (Madonna album)|Music]]'' (2000) contained elements of [[Euro disco]], especially the successful [[Music (Madonna song)|eponymous lead single]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-songs-of-the-aughts-20110617/madonna-music-19691231 |title=100 Best Songs of the 2000s: Madonna, 'Music' |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it was not until the mid-to-latter part of the decade when dance-pop music returned greatly to its disco roots; this can be seen with Madonna's album ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' (2005), which borrowed strong influences from the genre, especially from 1970s artists and bands such as [[ABBA]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Donna Summer]]. Britney Spears' album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007) contained influences of Euro disco.

The mid-to-late 2000s saw the arrival of several new dance-pop artists, including [[Rihanna]], [[Kesha]], [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Katy Perry]]. This period in time also saw dance-pop's return to its more electronic roots aside from its disco ones, with strong influences of synthpop and [[electropop]]; Rihanna's singles in the dance-pop genre, including "[[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don't Stop the Music]]" and "[[Disturbia (song)|Disturbia]]", contained electronic influences, the former of which has elements of house music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/rihannadontstop.htm |first=Bill |last=Lamb |title=Rihanna - Don't Stop the Music |website=Top 40 / Pop |accessdate=2014-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303223904/http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/rihannadontstop.htm |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter electropop; Lady Gaga's singles "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" and "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" were also heavily influenced by synthpop and electropop; Kesha's debut single, "[[Tik Tok]]", was also highly electronic in style and employed a [[video game music|video game]] beat. Katy Perry's "[[Hot N Cold (song)|Hot N Cold]]" (2008), "[[California Gurls (song)|California Gurls]]" (2010), and "[[Firework (song)|Firework]]" (2010), which were major commercial hits, also showcased influences of electropop and house music.

===2010s===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
The 2010s so far have, similarly to the late 2000s, seen strong electronic influences present within dance-pop and also heavy emphasis on bass-heavy drum beats. Dance-pop artists such as Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Kesha, Christina Aguilera, [[Usher (singer)|Usher]] and Rihanna remain very popular, and several new recording artists within the genre have or are starting to emerge. Country-pop artist [[Taylor Swift]]'s albums ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012) and ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) both contain more of a pop-influenced sound which features production by dance-pop producers [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]]. Ariana Grande's single "[[Problem (Ariana Grande song)|Problem]]" was a big hit in 2014.

==Characteristics==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
Dance-pop generally contains several notable characteristics, which are listed here:

*Uptempo, upbeat music intended for clubs, with a danceable or dance-centered nature.
*Catchy songs with an easy, pop-based structure
*A strong emphasis on [[Beat (music)|beat]]s and [[Groove (music)|grooves]]

==Critical reception==

===Episode One===
Noting the obscurity of the first episode, in [[IGN|IGN's]] review of Episode 2, it wrote "So, there is now an episode two of Dark Nebula. I know, you missed episode one. Now is your chance to make up for past transgressions."&lt;ref name="ign.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2010/08/06/dark-nebula-episode-two-review|title=Dark Nebula Episode Two Review|work=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Episode 2===
Dark Nebula - Episode Two has a rating of 91% on [[Metacritic]], based on 11 critic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/dark-nebula---episode-two|title=Dark Nebula - Episode Two|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slidetoplay said "The second chapter of Dark Nebula improves on the original where improvements needed to be made. A great game just got better. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slidetoplay.com/review/dark-nebula-episode-two-review/|title=Dark Nebula – Episode Two Review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appspy wrote "Dark Nebula - Episode 2 has developed in just the right ways to recapture what made the original so successful while building in new, exciting action elements. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appspy.com/review/4404/dark-nebula-episode-two-review|title=Dark Nebula - Episode Two Review|author=Andrew Nesvadba|date=8 August 2010|work=appspy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamepro wrote "The game is clearly made by a professional, and I can't recommend it enough. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/dark-nebula---episode-two/critic-reviews|title=Dark Nebula - Episode Two|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZTGD said "I want you to reward the development team of Dark Nebula: Episode 2 with your dollar, I want them to experience the positive affirmation of your purchase. I want this app to sell well, so that they can go forth and create more awesome. Now hop to it. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ztgd.com/reviews/dark-nebula-2/|title=Dark Nebula 2|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PocketGamerUK wrote "The best of old and new wrapped up in one package, the puzzle-platformer gameplay of Dark Nebula - Episode Two is too entertaining to put down. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Dark+Nebula+-+Episode+Two/review.asp?c=22974&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiplayer.it said "A simple but solid franchise as Dark Nebula could only give birth to a high-quality [[sequel]], but frankly we didn't expect so many new ideas. The graphics of the game, already excellent, have been further improved and now offer levels rich in details, well defined and unique. Episode Two is immediate and entertaining as Episode One, the tilt controls are very accurate and the action is characterized by a continuous introduction of new challenges to overcome. A must buy. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://multiplayer.it/recensioni/80028-dark-nebula-episode-two-palle-dacciaio.html|title=Dark Nebula - Episode Two|author=Tommaso Pugliese|date=30 August 2010|work=Multiplayer.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Touchgen said "Dark Nebula Episode Two is a triumph of budget game design on the AppStore."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.touchgen.net/dark-nebula-episode-two-review&lt;/ref&gt; 148apps wrote "We loved Dark Nebula: Episode One, but were saddened by its length-Episode Two "only" has twenty levels, but they're all fantastic.

Dark Nebula is a frenzied tilt game that bangs you over the head every stage with new challenges like laser tripwires, twirling blades, tricky jumps, and boss battles. "&lt;ref name="ign.com"/&gt; Eurogamer said "Hours are casually tossed aside in the process of ensuring that a ball safely reaches its destination, via moving walkways, spiked traps, bounce pads, industrial crushers and laser fire. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-03-28-mobile-games-roundup-review?page=2|title=Mobile Games Roundup Review • Page 2 • Eurogamer.net|date=28 March 2011|work=Eurogamer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together these clubs represent approximately 50,000 magicians from 50 countries as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Welcome|url = http://fism.org/web/about/welcome/|website = fism.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29|quote = consists of 95 magic societies which represent over 50,000 magicians from some 50 countries}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization hosts a self-named "FISM" conference every three years, where magicians compete for "Best of" categories. The most recent FISM was in 2018, held in [[Busan]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Championships of Magic|url = https://fism.org/championship-contests/world-championships-of-magic/|website = fism.org|accessdate = 2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Founded in 1948, it is one of the most recognized magic organizations in the magic circle. Currently, there are more than 80 member organizations and about 50,000 members from 50 countries and regions, including Taiwan’s Black Hat Magic Association and the Taiwan Magic Development Association (TMA). Another 808 magic item shop is also in the process Apply for membership. The FISM organizes a worldwide magic convention every three years. The member organizations fight for the right to host. Top magicians from all over the world will compete for the title of “World Magic Champion”. Prior to this, various regions will hold regional selections. FISM Europe, FISM Asia, FISM North America, FISM Latin America, FISM Africa, FISM Oceania, and member organizations have the quotas recommended by their regional selection committees.

== History ==

The roots of the FISM began in Paris, France, in 1937, at a meeting of the 34-year-old ASAP, ''Association Syndicale des Artistes Prestidigitateurs'' (Association of prestidigitation artists), which had a monthly magazine ''Le Journal de la Prestidigitation''. The group's vice-president, Dr. Jules Dhotel, wanted the ASAP to produce an international convention in Paris in October 1939, and then proceed to have the convention in a different country each year. Plans proceeded, but when the [[invasion of Poland|Nazis invaded Poland]] in September 1939, the convention was cancelled. After [[World War II]], progress resumed. In 1946, a hotel in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands, hosted an International Congress of Magicians, with over 300 registrants from around Europe. There were lectures, exhibits of antique books and apparatus, tours of Amsterdam, a public show, and a contest in which 20 magicians took part. There were no categories, so only one set of awards. First prize went to amateur French magician [[Jean Valton]], for an exceptional routine of card juggling and manipulation; second went to Scotland's amateur magician [[John Ramsay (magician)|John Ramsay]], and third to a professional husband-wife duo, De Flezkis, who combined magic and dance.

The 1947 "Congrès Magique International" brought in 500 attendees from 18 countries, and 70 participants in the competition. Meetings at that convention were held to discuss the creation of a formal international organization, and that was where the FISM title was proposed. While details were worked out, the "Congrès" conventions continued annually.

== Mission ==

FISM's stated aim is to create a centralized "voice" for the magic world and to help develop, elevate, and promote the art of magic. It coordinates activities of member societies and encourages communication between them, as well as the exchange of services. It has a corporate identity and a team of professional marketers. It also serves a capacity in the realm of [[intellectual property (magic)|intellectual property]], fighting against the copying or inappropriate release of magical inventions or routines.

== Convention ==
The FISM is probably best known for conducting one of the premier [[magic conventions]] in the world, the triennial "'''World Championship of Magic'''". [[Fred Kaps]] is the only three-time winner of the grand prize (1950, 1955, 1961).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fism.org/GrandPrixWinners.htm FISM Grand Prix World Champions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402150145/http://www.fism.org/GrandPrixWinners.htm |date=April 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 convention was held in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, where the Grand-Prix award in close-up magic was won by [[Rick Merrill]] from the USA, and the Grand Prix award in the stage magic division was won by [[Pilou]] from France.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The 2009 convention was held in [[Beijing]], China, where the Grand-Prix award in close-up magic was won by [[Shawn Farquhar]] from Canada, and the Grand Prix award in the stage magic division was won by Soma from Hungary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''GemCraft''''', also titled '''''GemCraft Chapter One: The Forgotten''''', is a [[tower defense]] [[flash game]] created by Hungarian studio Game In A Bottle, originally released on June 26, 2008. A prequel, '''''GemCraft Chapter 0: Gem of Eternity''''', was released April 16, 2009, and a disconnected chapter, '''''GemCraft lost chapter: Labyrinth''''', was released February 17, 2011. On April 4, 2014 the sequel to the first game '''''GemCraft Chapter Two: Chasing Shadows''''' was released. The original was released for [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] on April 14, 2011 by [[NTT Resonant]].&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

In ''GemCraft'', players are given [[Gemstone|gems]] to combine and put in towers. Different combinations of gems produce different effects, such as [[splash damage]], [[Damage over time]] and [[critical hit|triple damage]]. The player's life bar and magic energy are represented by the same statistic - [[mana]]. With mana, the player can purchase towers, gems, trenches, traps, and combine gems. A key aspect of strategy in ''GemCraft'' is to increase the player's mana gain to high levels, enabling creation of stronger and stronger gems. Combining two gems creates a single gem of higher power, or 'level'. The gems change with level.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Plot==
The series is set in a fictional fantasy world and depicts the battles of wizards against a powerful demon known as "The Forgotten". Wizards used to regularly summon demons to do their bidding until they brought forth a demon too powerful for them to control and capable of subduing other demons under her command. Described as "a fully black female torso with disfigured arms, a head with long hair and no face", the Forgotten commands her legions in order to conquer the "Spiritforge", the last bastion of the wizards in order to become omnipotent. The Forgotten cannot be destroyed, but sealed instead in a powerful artifact known as the "Gem of Eternity" but it can only contain her for a few decades and each time she escapes, a new gem must be crafted in order to capture her again.

==Reception==

[[Gamezebo]] gave the original ''GemCraft'' game a rating of 3.5/5.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamezebo.com/games/gemcraft/review&lt;/ref&gt; Slide to Play said the game did not distinguish itself from its peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slidetoplay.com/story/gemcraft-review |title=GemCraft Review at Slide To Play |publisher=Slide to Play |author=Andrew Webster |date=April 18, 2011 |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gravity Co., Ltd.''' ({{lang-ko|그라비티 주식회사}}) is a South Korean [[video game]] [[corporation]] primarily known for the development of the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] ''[[Ragnarok Online]]''.

==History==
The corporation started as a small business in Shinsa-dong, Kangnam-ku, [[Seoul]], South Korea and has expanded to an international corporate interest with several subsidiary divisions. On 8 February 2005, Gravity Corporation made their [[Initial public offering|IPO]] and traded $108 million US dollars on [[NASDAQ]] under the [[ticker symbol]] GRVY.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moneycentral.hoovers.com/global/msn/factsheet.xhtml?COID=137507 MSN Money IPO Center - Gravity Co., Ltd. IPO]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has had a rather turbulent history initially involving internal political conflicts between CEO [[Hakyu Kim]] (who eventually left the company), and company president Jung Ryool Kim (who later assumed control as CEO), but has since stabilised and expanded operations to all of north and south-east Asia through supervised partnerships with native corporate entities.  However, while Gravity Corporation's flagship product [[Ragnarok Online]] is considered a success in Asia, operations are  not as well developed in Europe and the United States in comparison to similar products marketed and developed there.

On 30 August 2005, Jung Ryool Kim, the controlling shareholder, sold his 52% stake and set plans to quit as a director. The buyers of his shares were Ezer and Techno Groove of Japan, a pair of technology ventures controlled by Il Young Ryu and Taizo and Masayoshi Son. After becoming the new majority shareholder, on 13 September 2005, Il Young Ryu was named by Gravity as its new chairman and joint chief executive. Il Young Ryu is also the founder of Area Network Limited and the CEO of Internet Japan.  In December, 2006, Techno Groove merged into Asian Groove, and ceased to exist.  EZER subsequently returned Techno Groove's investment of 9.9 billion yen to Asian Groove, which gave up any interest in Gravity. On 19 October 2007, EZER sold their interest in Gravity to Son Assets Management or SAM.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1313310/000136231007002852/c71451sc13dza.htm 19-10-2007 SEC 13-D/A Filing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1313310/000114554905001617/k01005sc13dza.txt 30-08-2005 SEC 13D Filing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1313310/000130901405000565/htm_715.htm 13-09-2005 SEC 6-K Filing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1313310/000119312507234377/dsc13da.htm 5-11-2007 SEC 13-D Filing]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2006, Gravity announced it had invested $9 Million in US game developer [[Perpetual Entertainment]].  Consequently, Gravity received a position on Perpetual's board of directors.  Gravity also received "priority rights for future access to contents and other intellectual property rights of Perpetual Entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1313310/000127528706002953/gc5969.txt 22-05-2006 SEC 6-K Filing]&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November 2007, Gravity announced they had lost their investment after Perpetual cancelled its development of the MMORPG [[Gods and Heroes]]. The loss would be reflected in their financial statement for 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1313310/000136231007003149/c71677e6vk.htm 21-11-2007 SEC 6-K Filing]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 December 2007, Gravity announced they had formed a new US-based game developer, L5 Games.  L5 is a subsidiary of Gravity Interactive, Inc. and is based in [[San Mateo, California]].  The company is composed of former [[Blizzard Entertainment]] employees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1313310/000136231007003249/c71727e6vk.htm 05-12-2007 SEC 6-K Filing]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2008, [[GungHo Online Entertainment]] obtained 52.4% stake of Gravity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINT32426220080214?rpc=44 Japan's GungHo to acquire S.Korea Gravity majority]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversion of Revenues Under Previous Management===
From 2002 through 2004, Gravity's chairman Mr. Jung Ryool Kim diverted approximately $6 Million in revenue from the company to himself.  In 2005, Kim sold his shares of Gravity to EZER, Inc., a Japanese corporation.  Kim paid the company back KRW 7.8 billion on 17 October 2005.  After an investigation, Gravity and Kim reached a final settlement where Mr. Kim would additionally pay Gravity "in part to reimburse the Company for certain of the costs and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the investigation of the former Chairman's diversion of revenues otherwise due to the Company." Both parties agreed to cease any civil and criminal litigation against one another.  As a result of the investigation, Gravity was forced to restate its financial statements for the years 2002-2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1313310/000127528706002895/gc5934.txt 18-05-2006 SEC 6-K Filing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1313310/000130901405000521/htm_666.htm 08-2005 SEC 6-K Filing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1313310/000130901405000672/htm_823.htm 10-2005 SEC 6-K Filing]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settlement, Conclusion Of Litigation===
In 2006, two U.S. based [[hedge fund]]s created a committee for "fair treatment of minority shareholders" which initiated litigation charging that the majority shareholders and officers have violated their fiduciary obligations.

The funds, Moon Capital Management and Ramius Capital Group, both headquartered in New York City, demanded that Gravity call an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders to give them a chance to vote Il Young Ryu out of office. Their demands were in time successful, and a meeting was scheduled for 26 December.

On 11 June 2007, Gravity announced that it and other defendants had reached an agreement in principle to settle the class action litigation brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company's American Depository Shares during the period from 7 February 2005 November 10, 2005, inclusive. $10 Million was set aside to pay the plaintiffs, $5 Million of which came directly from Gravity, in exchange for being released from any liability. However, the company continued to deny any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1313310/000130901407000349/htm_2274.htm 11-06-2007 SEC 6-K Filing]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 2008, Gravity announced that the federal judge presiding over the consolidated class action approved the settlement of the class action. In addition, no plaintiff has filed an appeal during the 30-day time appeal period which expired on 21 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;

      <comment>FIgures cited state a 2.66x INCREASE of bandwidth. However, the bandwidth of MDI 2.1 is 2.66 TIMES (2.66x, or (48/18)) the bandwitdh of HDMI 2.0, or a 1.66x INCREASE over HDMI 2.0 ((48-18)/18).  Similarly, for the stated figures for the data rate (bandwidth less non-data encoding bits).</comment>

&lt;!-- Please note that HDMI is the common name, which is explained in [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)]], for the High-Definition Multimedia Interface. See also [[WP:ABBR]] for why this title is appropriate. --&gt;
'''HDMI''' ('''High-Definition Multimedia Interface''') is a [[proprietary hardware|proprietary]] audio/video [[Interface (computing)|interface]] for transmitting [[uncompressed video]] data and compressed or uncompressed [[digital audio]] data from an HDMI-compliant source device, such as a [[display controller]], to a compatible [[visual display unit|computer monitor]], [[video projector]], [[digital television]], or [[digital audio]] device.&lt;ref name="HDMIFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdmi.org/learningcenter/faq.aspx|title=HDMI FAQ|publisher=HDMI.org|accessdate=July 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; HDMI is a digital replacement for [[analog video]] standards.

HDMI implements the [[CEA-861|EIA/CEA-861]] standards, which define video formats and waveforms, transport of compressed and uncompressed [[Linear pulse-code modulation|LPCM]] audio, auxiliary data, and implementations of the [[Extended display identification data|VESA EDID]].&lt;ref&gt;CEA-861-D, A DTV Profile for Uncompressed High Speed Digital Interfaces, §1 Scope&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=p. III}} CEA-861 signals carried by HDMI are electrically compatible with the CEA-861 signals used by the [[digital visual interface]] (DVI). No signal conversion is necessary, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§C}} The [[Consumer Electronics Control|CEC]] (Consumer Electronics Control) capability allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one handheld [[remote control]] device.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.microprocessor.org/HDMISpecification13a.pdf|title=High-Definition Multimedia Interface Specification 1.3a|date=November 10, 2006|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|format=PDF|via=Microprocessor.org|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at=§6.3}}

Several versions of HDMI have been developed and deployed since initial release of the technology, but all use the same cable and connector. Other than improved audio and video capacity, performance, resolution and color spaces, newer versions have optional advanced features such as [[3D television|3D]], [[Ethernet]] data connection, and CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) extensions.

Production of consumer HDMI products started in late 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/pr/pr_20030905.aspx |title=The First HDMI Consumer Electronics Products Debut at Cedia 2003 |publisher=HDMI.org |date=September 5, 2003 |accessdate=May 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe either DVI-HDCP or HDMI is included in the [[HD ready]] in-store labeling specification for TV sets for HDTV, formulated by [[European Information, Communications and Consumer Electronics Technology Industry Associations|EICTA]] with [[SES Astra]] in 2005.

==Specifications==
The HDMI specification defines the protocols, signals, electrical interfaces and mechanical requirements of the standard.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a" /&gt;{{rp |at=p. V}} The maximum pixel clock rate for HDMI 1.0 is 165&amp;nbsp;MHz, which is sufficient to allow [[1080p]] and [[WUXGA]] (1920×1200) at 60{{nbsp}}Hz. HDMI 1.3 increases that to 340&amp;nbsp;MHz, which allows for higher resolution (such as [[Graphic display resolutions#WQXGA|WQXGA]], 2560×1600) across a single digital link.&lt;ref name="HDMI2006pr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/pr/pr_20060622.asp|title=HDMI 1.3 doubles bandwidth, delivers billions of colors for HDTVs|last=|first=|date=June 22, 2006|website=hdmi.org|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222002356/http://www.hdmi.org/press/pr/pr_20060622.asp|archivedate=February 22, 2008|accessdate=June 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An HDMI connection can either be single-link (type A/C/D) or dual-link (type B) and can have a video pixel rate of 25&amp;nbsp;MHz to 340&amp;nbsp;MHz (for a single-link connection) or 25&amp;nbsp;MHz to 680&amp;nbsp;MHz (for a dual-link connection). Video formats with rates below 25&amp;nbsp;MHz (e.g., 13.5&amp;nbsp;MHz for 480i/NTSC) are transmitted using a pixel-repetition scheme.&lt;ref name="HDMIFAQ" /&gt;

===Audio/video===
HDMI uses the [[Consumer Electronics Association]]/[[Electronic Industries Alliance]] 861 standards. HDMI 1.0 to HDMI 1.2a uses the EIA/CEA-861-B video standard, HDMI 1.3 uses the CEA-861-D video standard, and HDMI 1.4 uses the CEA-861-E video standard.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at= p. III}} The CEA-861-E document defines "video formats and waveforms; colorimetry and quantization; transport of compressed and uncompressed [[Linear Pulse Code Modulation|LPCM]] audio; carriage of auxiliary data; and implementations of the [[Video Electronics Standards Association]] (VESA) [[Extended display identification data#Enhanced EDID (E-EDID)|Enhanced Extended Display Identification Data Standard]] (E-EDID)".&lt;ref name="CEA-861-E Standards Details"&gt;{{cite news|title= Standards Details – CEA-861-E |publisher= Consumer Electronics Association |url=http://www.ce.org/Standards/browseByCommittee_2641.asp |date= March 1, 2008 |accessdate= November 20, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107163712/http://www.ce.org/Standards/browseByCommittee_2641.asp |archivedate= November 7, 2011 |df= mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 15, 2013, the CEA announced the publication of CEA-861-F, a standard that can be used by interfaces such as DVI, HDMI, and LVDS.&lt;ref name= CEA861FpublishedJuly2013Businesswire&gt;{{cite news |title=CEA Announces Publication of New DTV Interface Standard |work =[[Business Wire]] |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130715006388/en/CEA-Announces-Publication-DTV-Interface-Standard |date=July 15, 2013 |accessdate= July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEA-861-F adds the ability to transmit several [[Ultra high definition television|Ultra HD]] video formats and additional color spaces.&lt;ref name= CEA861FpublishedJuly2013Businesswire /&gt;

To ensure baseline compatibility between different HDMI sources and displays (as well as backward compatibility with the electrically compatible DVI standard) all HDMI devices must implement the [[sRGB]] color space at 8 bits per component.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a" /&gt;{{rp|at= §6.2.3}} Ability to use the {{YCbCr}} color space and higher color depths ("deep color") is optional. HDMI permits sRGB 4:4:4 [[chroma subsampling]] (8–16 bits per component), [[xvYCC]] 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), or {{YCbCr}} 4:2:2 chroma subsampling (8–12 bits per component). The color spaces that can be used by HDMI are [[Rec. 601|ITU-R BT.601]], [[Rec. 709|ITU-R BT.709-5]] and [[xvYCC|IEC 61966-2-4]].&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§§6.5,6.7.2}}

For digital audio, if an HDMI device has audio, it is required to implement the baseline format: stereo (uncompressed) PCM. Other formats are optional, with HDMI allowing up to 8 channels of uncompressed audio at sample sizes of 16-bit, 20-bit and 24-bit, with sample rates of 32{{nbsp}}kHz, 44.1{{nbsp}}kHz, 48{{nbsp}}kHz, 88.2{{nbsp}}kHz, 96{{nbsp}}kHz, 176.4{{nbsp}}kHz and 192{{nbsp}}kHz.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§7}} HDMI also carries any [[IEC 61937]]-compliant compressed audio stream, such as [[Dolby Digital]] and [[Digital Theater System|DTS]], and up to 8 channels of one-bit [[Direct Stream Digital|DSD]] audio (used on [[Super Audio CD]]s) at rates up to four times that of Super Audio CD.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§7}} With version 1.3, HDMI allows lossless compressed audio streams [[Dolby TrueHD]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]].&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§7}} As with the {{YCbCr}} video, audio capability is optional. Audio return channel (ARC) is a feature introduced in the HDMI 1.4 standard.&lt;ref name="HDMIwebsiteARC"/&gt; "Return" refers to the case where the audio comes from the TV and can be sent "upstream" to the AV receiver using the HDMI cable connected to the AV receiver.&lt;ref name="HDMIwebsiteARC"/&gt; An example given on the HDMI website is that a TV that directly receives a terrestrial/satellite broadcast, or has a video source built in, sends the audio "upstream" to the AV receiver.&lt;ref name="HDMIwebsiteARC"/&gt;

The HDMI standard was not designed to pass [[closed caption]] data (for example, [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]]) to the television for decoding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Closed captions#HDTV interoperability issues]]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to appear on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a [[DVD]] player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an [[HDTV]] has no way to pass [[Closed captioning|Closed Captioning]] data so that the HDTV can decode it, as there is [[Closed captioning#HDTV interoperability issues|no line 21 VBI]] in that format.

===Communication channels===
HDMI has three physically separate communication channels, which are the DDC, TMDS and the optional CEC.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§8.1}} HDMI 1.4 added ARC and HEC.&lt;ref name=HDMIwebsiteARC/&gt;&lt;ref name=HDMIwebsiteHEC/&gt;

====Display Data Channel (DDC)====
{{Main|Display Data Channel}}
The [[Display Data Channel]] (DDC) is a communication channel based on the [[I²C]] bus specification. HDMI specifically requires the device implement the [[Display Data Channel#Enhanced Display Data Channel (E-DDC)|Enhanced Display Data Channel]] (E-DDC), which is used by the HDMI source device to read the [[Extended display identification data#Enhanced EDID (E-EDID)|E-EDID]] data from the HDMI sink device to learn what audio/video formats it can take.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§§8.1,CEC-1.2–CEC-1.3}} HDMI requires that the E-DDC implement [[I²C]] standard mode speed (100&amp;nbsp;[[kbit/s]]) and allows it to optionally implement fast mode speed (400&amp;nbsp;kbit/s).&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§4.2.8}}

The DDC channel is actively used for [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection]] (HDCP).

====Transition-Minimized Differential Signaling (TMDS)====
[[Transition-minimized differential signaling]] (TMDS) on HDMI interleaves video, audio and auxiliary data using three different packet types, called the Video Data Period, the Data Island Period and the Control Period. During the Video Data Period, the pixels of an active video line are transmitted. During the Data Island period (which occurs during the horizontal and vertical blanking intervals), audio and auxiliary data are transmitted within a series of packets. The Control Period occurs between Video and Data Island periods.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§5.1.2}}

Both HDMI and [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] use TMDS to send 10-bit characters that are encoded using [[8b/10b encoding]] that differs from the original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of [[BCH code|BCH]] ECC parity data for [[Error detection and correction#Error-correcting code|error correction]] and describes the contents of the packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and [[Color depth|Color Depth]] (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for [[deep color]]). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the [[color space]] being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§§5.2–5.3,6.5.3,6.7.2,6.7.3}}

Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) is an HDMI feature designed to allow the user to command and control up to 15 CEC-enabled devices, that are connected through HDMI,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anandtech.com/show/5463/pulseeight-usb-cec-adapter-review Pulse-Eight USB CEC Adapter Review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/143777/the_secret_feature_on_your_hdtv_hdmi_cec.html|title=The Secret Feature on Your HDTV: HDMI CEC|date=March 26, 2008|work=TechHive}}&lt;/ref&gt; by using only one of their remote controls (for example by controlling a [[television set]], [[set-top box]], and [[DVD player]] using only the remote control of the TV). CEC also allows for individual CEC-enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§CEC-3.1}}

It is a one-wire bidirectional [[serial communications|serial]] bus that is based on the [[European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization|CENELEC]] standard [[AV.link]] protocol to perform [[remote control]] functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quantumdata.com/pdf/CEC_White_Paper.pdf |title=CEC White Paper |website=www.quantumdata.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEC wiring is mandatory, although implementation of CEC in a product is optional.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§8.1}} It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added timer and audio commands to the bus).&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§§CEC-1.2,CEC-1.3,CEC-3.1,CEC-5}} USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC-enabled devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The USB-CEC Adapter is a look into the Future |publisher=xbmc |url=http://xbmc.org/natethomas/2011/11/01/the-usb-cec-adapter-is-a-look-into-the-future/ |date=November 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126145919/http://xbmc.org/natethomas/2011/11/01/the-usb-cec-adapter-is-a-look-into-the-future/ |archivedate=November 26, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=USB – CEC Adapter |publisher=Pulse-Eight |url=http://www.pulse-eight.com/store/products/104-usb-hdmi-cec-adapter.aspx |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Take control of your TV with your HTPC via HDMI-CEC |publisher=Engadget |url=http://hd.engadget.com/2010/08/25/take-control-of-your-tv-with-your-htpc-via-hdmi-cec/ |date=August 25, 2011 |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=HDMI-CEC to USB and RS-232 bridge/converter |publisher=RainShadow Technology |url=http://rainshadowtech.com/default_files/HDMICECUSB.htm |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel====
Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a high-speed bidirectional data communication link (HEC) and the ability to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused ''Reserved'' pin (called HEAC+) and the ''Hot Plug Detect'' pin (called HEAC−).&lt;ref name="HDMI1.4a"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.microprocessor.org/HDMISpecification14a.pdf|title=High-Definition Multimedia Interface Specification 1.4|date=June 5, 2009|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|format=PDF|via=Microprocessor.org|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at=§HEAC-2.1}} If only ARC transmission is required, a [[Single-ended signaling|single mode signal]] using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a [[Differential signaling|differential signal]] over the pair of lines, and ARC as a common mode component of the pair.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.4a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§HEAC-2.2}}
     
{{anchor|ARC|Audio Return Channel}}
'''Audio Return Channel (ARC)'''

ARC is an audio link meant to replace other cables between the TV and the A/V receiver or speaker system.&lt;ref name=HDMIwebsiteARC/&gt; This direction is used when the TV is the one that generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment.&lt;ref name=HDMIwebsiteARC/&gt; A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but reproduction of audio is handled by the other equipment.&lt;ref name=HDMIwebsiteARC/&gt; Without ARC, the audio output from the TV must be routed by another cable, typically TOSLink or coax, into the speaker system.&lt;ref name=HDMIwebsiteARC/&gt;&lt;ref name="cepro.com"&gt;[http://www.cepro.com/article/hdmi_14_delivers_ethernet_and_upstream_audio_over_1_cable/]{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|HEC|HDMI Ethernet Channel}}
'''HDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC)'''

HDMI Ethernet Channel technology consolidates video, audio, and data streams into a single HDMI cable, and the HEC feature enables IP-based applications over HDMI and provides a bidirectional Ethernet communication at 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref name=HDMIwebsiteHEC/&gt; The [[Ethernet physical layer|physical layer]] of the Ethernet implementation uses a [[telephone hybrid|hybrid]] to simultaneously send and receive attenuated [[100BASE-TX]] type signals through a single [[twisted pair]].&lt;ref name="cepro.com"/&gt;{{failed verification|reason=No mention of 100BASE-TX here|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|8472351}} from 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=Patent not authoritatively linked to HDMI|date=September 2017}}

===Compatibility with DVI===
[[File:DVI-HDMI-Adapter.jpg|thumb|alt=An adapter with a DVI receptacle connector to HDMI plug connector.|An adapter with HDMI (male) and DVI (female) connectors]]
[[File:Adapter dvi hdmi S7302224 wp.jpg|thumb|alt=An adapter with an HDMI receptacle connector to DVI plug connector with a close up of the HDMI connector.|An adapter with DVI and HDMI (female) connectors]]
HDMI is [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with single-link [[Digital Visual Interface]] digital video (DVI-D or DVI-I, but not DVI-A). No signal conversion is required when an adapter or asymmetric cable is used, so there is no loss of video quality.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=appx. C}}

From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can be driven by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an overlapping minimum set of allowed resolutions and frame-buffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability. In the reverse case, a DVI-D monitor has the same level of basic interoperability unless content protection with [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection]] (HDCP) interferes—or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space [[YCbCr|{{YCbCr}}]] instead of [[RGB]], which is not possible in DVI. An HDMI source, such as a [[Blu-ray]] player, may require an HDCP-compliant display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Digital Content Protection FAQs|publisher=Digital Content Protection, LLC |url=http://www.digital-cp.com/faqs|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further complication is that there is a small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.

Any DVI-to-HDMI adapter can function as an HDMI-to-DVI adapter (and vice versa).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Typically, the only limitation is the [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|gender of the adapter's connectors]] and the gender of the cables and sockets it is used with.

Features specific to HDMI, such as remote-control and audio transport, are not available in devices that use legacy DVI-D signalling. However, many devices output HDMI over a DVI connector (e.g., [[Radeon R600|ATI 3000-series]] and [[GeForce 200 Series|NVIDIA GTX 200-series]] video cards),&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=appx. C}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2562/~/if-i-am-using-a-dvi-to-hdmi-cable-will-audio-be-transmitted-over-this-cable-to|title=If I am using a DVI-to-HDMI cable will audio be transmitted over this cable to the 3D TV? - NVIDIA|website=nvidia.custhelp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some multimedia displays may accept HDMI (including audio) over a DVI input. Exact capabilities beyond basic compatibility vary. Adapters are generally bi-directional.

===Content protection (HDCP)===
{{Main|High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection}}
High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) is a newer form of [[digital rights management]]. Intel created the original technology to make sure that digital content followed the guidelines set by the Digital Content Protection group.

HDMI can use [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]] to encrypt the signal if required by the source device. [[Content Scramble System|CSS]], [[Content Protection for Recordable Media|CPRM]] and [[Advanced Access Content System|AACS]] require the use of HDCP on HDMI when playing back encrypted [[DVD Video]], [[DVD Audio]], [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]]. The [[HDCP Repeater bit]] controls the authentication and switching/distribution of an HDMI signal. According to HDCP Specification 1.2 (beginning with HDMI CTS 1.3a), any system that implements HDCP must do so in a fully compliant manner. HDCP testing that was previously only a requirement for optional tests such as the "Simplay HD" testing program is now part of the requirements for HDMI compliance.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§9.2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Retailer Requires 'Simplay' HDMI Testing |publisher=TWICE |url=http://www.twice.com/article/238949-Retailer_Requires_Simplay_HDMI_Testing.php |date=December 11, 2006 |accessdate=November 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919135551/http://www.twice.com/article/238949-Retailer_Requires_Simplay_HDMI_Testing.php |archivedate=September 19, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HDMI20072"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hdmi.org/pdf/2007_11HDMI_ComplianceTestingPolicies.pdf |title=HDMI Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures |publisher=HDMI.org |accessdate=May 4, 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; HDCP accommodates up to 127 connected devices with up to 7 levels, using a combination of sources, sinks and repeaters.&lt;ref name="HDCPSummary"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digital-cp.com/files/documents/04A897FD-FEF1-0EEE-CDBB649127F79525/HDCP_deciphered_070808.pdf |title=HDCP deciphered White Paper |publisher=Digital Content Protection |date=July 8, 2008 |accessdate=October 23, 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920191718/http://www.digital-cp.com/files/documents/04A897FD-FEF1-0EEE-CDBB649127F79525/HDCP_deciphered_070808.pdf |archivedate=September 20, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple example of this is several HDMI devices connected to an HDMI AV receiver that is connected to an HDMI display.&lt;ref name="HDCPSummary"/&gt;

Devices called HDCP strippers can remove the HDCP information from the video signal so the video can play on non-HDCP-compliant displays,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ryan Block |title=The Clicker: HDCP's Shiny Red Button |work=[[Engadget]] |url=https://www.engadget.com/2005/07/21/the-clicker-hdcps-shiny-red-button/ |date=July 21, 2005 |accessdate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; though a [[fair use]] and [[non-disclosure]] form must usually be signed with a registering agency before use.

[[File:HDMI-Kabel.jpg|thumb|A standard HDMI cable.]]
An HDMI cable is composed of four shielded [[twisted pair]]s, with impedance of the order of 100&amp;nbsp;[[ohm|Ω]] (±15%), plus seven separate conductors. HDMI cables with Ethernet differ in that three of the separate conductors instead form an additional shielded twisted pair (with the CEC/DDC ground as a shield).&lt;ref name="HDMI1.4a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§HEAC-2.9}}

An HDMI extender is a single device (or pair of devices) powered with an external power source or with the 5V DC from the HDMI source.&lt;ref name="HDMILongCableLengths"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hdmi.org/installers/longcablelengths.aspx |title= Running Long Cable Lengths |publisher=HDMI |accessdate= June 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="XCAT-250"&gt;{{cite news |title=Model XCAT-250 Operation Manual |publisher= Extenhd |url=http://www.extenhd.com/manuals/XCAT-250_User_manual.pdf |date= August 20, 2007 |accessdate= May 13, 2009 |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HDMIFiberExtender"&gt;{{cite news |title= F1 HDMI over Fiber Extender |publisher= Xreo |url= http://www.xreo.ca/HDMI-Extender/f1-hdmi-over-fiber-extender.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160106223845/http://www.xreo.ca/HDMI-Extender/f1-hdmi-over-fiber-extender.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= January 6, 2016 |accessdate= May 13, 2009 |format= PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long cables can cause instability of [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]] and blinking on the screen, due to the weakened [[Display Data Channel|DDC]] signal that HDCP requires. HDCP DDC signals must be multiplexed with TMDS video signals to comply with HDCP requirements for HDMI extenders based on a single [[Category 5 cable|Category 5]]/[[Category 6 cable]].&lt;ref name="HDCPLicense"&gt;{{cite news|title=HDCP License Agreement |date=January 16, 2008 |publisher=Digital Content Protection, LLC |url=http://www.digital-cp.com/files/static_page_files/D6724AFD-9B02-A253-D8D2FE5B1A10F7F7/HDCP_License_Agreement_082207.pdf |accessdate=November 18, 2009 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419204233/http://www.digital-cp.com/files/static_page_files/D6724AFD-9B02-A253-D8D2FE5B1A10F7F7/HDCP_License_Agreement_082207.pdf |archivedate=April 19, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Digital Millennium Copyright Act |publisher= U.S. Copyright Office |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act |date= October 28, 1998 |accessdate = June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several companies offer [[amplifier]]s, [[Equalization (communications)|equalizers]] and [[repeater]]s that can string several standard HDMI cables together.

===Licensing===&lt;!--Linked from section Relationship with DisplayPort--&gt;

The HDMI specification is not an open standard; manufacturers need to be licensed by HDMI LLC in order to implement HDMI in any product or component. Companies who are licensed by HDMI LLC are known as HDMI Adopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jain|first1=Kavitha|title=What are the Licensing Costs Associated with HDMI?|url=https://www.semiconductorstore.com/blog/2014/licensing-costs-HDMI/654|website=semiconductorstore.com|publisher=Symmetry Electronics|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====HDMI Ado&lt;!-- ADOPTERS IS CORRECT, NOT "ADAPTERS" --&gt;pters====

While earlier versions of HDMI specs are available to the public for download, only Adopters have access to the latest standards (HDMI 1.4/1.4a/2).

* Only Adopters have access to the Compliance Test Specification (CTS) that is used for compliance and certification

This is required before any HDMI product can be legally sold.
* Adopters have IP rights
* Adopters receive the right to use HDMI logos and TMs on their products and marketing materials
* Adopters are listed on the HDMI website
* Products from Adopters are listed and marketed in the official HDMI product finder database
* Adopters receive more exposure through combined marketing, such as the annual HDMI Developers Conference and technology seminars

====HDMI Fee Structure====

There are 2 annual fee structures associated with being an HDMI Adopter:

* High-volume (more than 10,000 units) HDMI Adopter Agreement - [[United States dollar|US$]]10k/year&lt;ref name= hdmiterms&gt;{{cite news |title= HDMI Adopter Terms |publisher= HDMI |url=http://www.hdmi.org/manufacturer/terms.aspx |accessdate= June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Low-volume (10,000 units or fewer) HDMI Adopter Agreement - US$5k/year + flat US$1/unit administration fee&lt;ref name= hdmiterms /&gt;

The annual fee is due upon the execution of the Adopter Agreement, and must be paid on the anniversary of this date each year thereafter.

The royalty fee structure is the same for all volumes. The following variable per-unit royalty is device-based and not dependent on number of ports, chips or connectors:

* US$0.15 – for each end-user licensed product&lt;ref name= hdmiterms /&gt;
* US$0.05 – If the HDMI logo is used on the product and promotional material, the per-unit fee drops from US$0.15 to US$0.05.&lt;ref name= hdmiterms /&gt;
* US$0.04 – If HDCP is implemented and HDMI logo is used, the per-unit fee drops from US$0.05 to US$0.04&lt;ref name= hdmiterms /&gt;

Use of HDMI logo requires compliance testing. Adopters must license HDCP separately.

The HDMI royalty is only payable on Licensed Products that will be sold on a stand-alone basis (i.e. that are not incorporated into another Licensed Product that is subject to an HDMI royalty). For example, if a cable or IC is sold to an Adopter who then includes it in a television subject to a royalty, then the cable or IC maker would not pay a royalty, and the television manufacturer would pay the royalty on the final product. If the cable is sold directly to consumers, then the cable would be subject to a royalty.&lt;ref name= hdmiterms /&gt;

==Versions==
HDMI devices are manufactured to adhere to various versions of the specification, in which each version is given a number or letter, such as 1.0, 1.2, or 1.4b.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=p. III}} Each subsequent version of the specification uses the same kind of cable but increases the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] or capabilities of what can be transmitted over the cable.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=p. III}} A product listed as having an HDMI version does not necessarily mean that it has all features in that version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HDMI cable version numbers|url=http://www.selby.com.au/blog/hdmi-cable-version-numbers|publisher=Selby Acoustics|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; since some HDMI features are optional, such as deep color and xvYCC (which is branded by Sony as "x.v.Color").&lt;ref name="HDMIhometoys"&gt;{{cite news |title=Home Toys Interview December 2007|publisher=hometoys|url=http://www.hometoys.com/htinews/dec07/interviews/hdmi/hdmi.htm |author=Steve Venuti |date=December 2007 |accessdate=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transformation is Sony's CES theme |publisher=Sony |url=http://news.sel.sony.com/en/press_room/consumer/television/release/27367.html/ |date=January 7, 2007 |accessdate=June 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that since the release of HDMI 1.4, the HDMI Licensing LLC group (which oversees the HDMI standard) has banned the use of version numbers to identify cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalhome.ca/2009/11/version-numbers-to-be-banned-on-hdmi-cables|title=Version numbers to be banned on HDMI cables}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-cable HDMI products, starting on January 1, 2012, may no longer reference the HDMI number, and must state which features of the HDMI specification the product implements.&lt;ref name="HDMI2009TradeLogoGuidelines"&gt;{{cite news |title=Adopted Trademark and Logo Usage Guidelines |publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC |url=http://www.hdmi.org/download/guidelines/2009_11_18_RevisedTradeLogo_Guidelines_FINAL_a.pdf |format=PDF |date=November 18, 2009 |accessdate=May 31, 2010 |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Version 1.0 ===
HDMI 1.0 was released on December 9, 2002 and is a single-cable digital audio/video connector interface. The link architecture is based on DVI, using exactly the same video transmission format but sending audio and other auxiliary data during the blanking intervals of the video stream. HDMI 1.0 allows a maximum TMDS clock of 165&amp;nbsp;MHz (4.95 [[Gbit/s]] bandwidth per link), the same as DVI. It defines two connectors called Type A and Type B, with pinouts based on the Single-Link DVI-D and Dual-Link DVI-D connectors respectively, though the Type B connector was never used in any commercial products. HDMI 1.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for video transmission, giving it 3.96&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s of video bandwidth (1920&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1080 or 1920&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1200 at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) and 8&amp;nbsp;channel [[Linear pulse code modulation|LPCM]]/192&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|kHz]]/24-bit audio. HDMI 1.0 requires support for RGB video, with optional support for {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 (mandatory if the device has support for {{YCbCr}} on other interfaces). Color depth of 10{{nbsp}}bpc (30{{nbsp}}bit/px) or 12{{nbsp}}bpc (36{{nbsp}}bit/px) is allowed when using 4:2:2 subsampling, but only 8{{nbsp}}bpc (24{{nbsp}}bit/px) color depth is permitted when using RGB or {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4. Only the [[Rec. 601]] and [[Rec. 709]] color spaces are supported. HDMI 1.0 allows only specific pre-defined video formats, including all the formats defined in EIA/CEA-861-B and some additional formats listed in the HDMI Specification itself. All HDMI sources/sinks must also be capable of sending/receiving native Single-Link DVI video and be fully compliant with the DVI Specification.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.0"&gt;{{cite web|title=HDMI Specification Informational Version 1.0|url=https://www.ketos.eu/fs/11a71061-4b14-11e5-ad75-85850ba828cf-meridian-general-info-eng-hdmi-specs.pdf|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Version 1.1 ===
HDMI 1.1 was released on May 20, 2004 and added support for [[DVD-Audio]].

=== Version 1.2 ===
HDMI 1.2 was released on August 8, 2005 and added the option of One Bit Audio, used on [[Super Audio CD]]s, at up to 8 channels. To make HDMI more suitable for use on PC devices, version 1.2 also removed the requirement that only explicitly supported formats be used. It added the ability for manufacturers to create vendor-specific formats, allowing any arbitrary resolution and refresh rate rather than being limited to a pre-defined list of supported formats. In addition, it added explicit support for several new formats including 720p at 100 and 120&amp;nbsp;Hz and relaxed the pixel format support requirements so that sources with only native RGB output (PC sources) would not be required to support {{YCbCr}} output.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.2a"&gt;{{cite web|title=HDMI Specification Version 1.2a|url=http://read.pudn.com/downloads72/doc/261979/HDMI_Specification_1.2a.pdf|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at=§6.2.3}}

===Version 1.3===

HDMI 1.3 was released on June 22, 2006, and increased the maximum TMDS clock to 340&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] (10.2&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s).&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HDMI2006pr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.twice.com/article/259052-HDMI_1_3_Connections_Due_By_Year_End.php |title=HDMI 1.3 Connections Due By Year End |author=Joseph Palenchar |publisher=TWICE |date=June 19, 2006 |accessdate=November 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110084242/http://www.twice.com/article/259052-HDMI_1_3_Connections_Due_By_Year_End.php |archivedate=November 10, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like previous versions, it uses 8b/10b encoding, giving it a maximum video bandwidth of 8.16&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s (1920{{nbsp}}&amp;times;{{nbsp}}1080 at 120&amp;nbsp;Hz or 2560{{nbsp}}&amp;times;{{nbsp}}1440 at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz). It added support for 10&amp;nbsp;bpc, 12&amp;nbsp;bpc, and 16&amp;nbsp;bpc color depth (30, 36, and 48&amp;nbsp;bit/px), called [[deep color]]. It also added support for the [[xvYCC]] color space, in addition to the Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces supported by previous versions, and added the ability to carry metadata defining color gamut boundaries. It also optionally allows output of [[Dolby TrueHD]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]] streams for external decoding by AV receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdtvmagazine.com/articles/2006/08/hdmi_part_5_-_audio_in_hdmi_versions.php|title=HDMI Part 5 – Audio in HDMI Versions |publisher=HDTVMagazine.com |date=August 8, 2006 |accessdate=August 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporates automatic audio syncing ([[audio video sync]]) capability.&lt;ref name="HDMI2006pr"/&gt; It defined cable Categories 1 and 2, with Category 1 cable being tested up to 74.25&amp;nbsp;MHz and Category 2 being tested up to 340&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§4.2.6}} It also added the new type C Mini connector for portable devices.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§4.1.1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.engadgethd.com/2006/06/28/pics-of-the-hdmi-mini-connector |title=Pics of the HDMI-mini connector |author=Matt Burns |publisher=engadgetHD |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=November 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HDMI 1.3a''' was released on November 10, 2006, and had Cable and Sink modifications for type C, source termination recommendations, and removed undershoot and maximum rise/fall time limits. It also changed CEC capacitance limits, and CEC commands for timer control were brought back in an altered form, with audio control commands added. It also added the optional ability to stream SACD in its bitstream DST format rather than uncompressed raw DSD.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;

===Version 2.1===
HDMI 2.1 was officially announced by the HDMI Forum on January{{nbsp}}4, 2017,&lt;ref name="HDMI21Announcement"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/press_release.aspx?prid=145|title=HDMI 2.1 Press Release|last=|first=|date=4 January 2017|work=HDMI Forum, Inc|publisher=hdmi.org|via=|accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HDMI21Introduction"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hdmi.org/manufacturer/hdmi_2_1/index.aspx|title=HDMI 2.1 Overview|last=|first=|date=4 January 2017|work=HDMI Forum, Inc|publisher=hdmi.org|via=|accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released on November 28, 2017.&lt;ref name="HDMI21Release"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hdmi.org/press/press_release.aspx?prid=152|title=HDMI :: Press Release|website=www.hdmi.org |date=2017-11-28 |access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It adds support for higher resolutions and higher refresh rates, including 4K 120{{nbsp}}Hz and [[8K resolution|8K]] 120{{nbsp}}Hz. HDMI 2.1 also introduces a new HDMI cable category called ''Ultra High Speed'' (referred to as ''48G'' during development), which certifies cables at the new higher speeds that these formats require. Ultra High Speed HDMI cables are backwards compatible with older HDMI devices, and older cables are compatible with new HDMI 2.1 devices, though the full 48{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth is not possible without the new cables.

Additional features of HDMI 2.1:&lt;ref name="HDMI21January2017Anandtech"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/11003/hdmi-21-announced-8kp60-48gbps-cable |title=HDMI 2.1 Announced|author=Anton Shilov |publisher=Anandtech |date=2017-01-05 |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HDMI21Release"/&gt;

* Maximum supported resolution is [[10K resolution|10K]] at 120{{nbsp}}Hz
* Dynamic HDR for specifying HDR metadata on a scene-by-scene or even a frame-by-frame basis
* [[Display Stream Compression]] (DSC) 1.2 is used for video formats higher than 8K with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling
* [[High frame rate|High Frame Rate]] (HFR) for 4K, 8K, and 10K, which adds support for refresh rates up to 120{{nbsp}}Hz
* Enhanced Audio Return Channel (eARC) for object-based audio formats such as [[Dolby Atmos]] and [[DTS:X]]
* Enhanced refresh rate features:
** Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) reduces or eliminates lag, stutter and frame tearing for more fluid motion in games
** Quick Media Switching (QMS) for movies and video eliminates the delay that can result in blank screens before content is displayed
** Quick Frame Transport (QFT) reduces latency
* Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) automatic latency setting to the lowest ideal latency

Video formats that require more bandwidth than 18.0 Gbit/s (4K 60{{nbsp}}Hz 8{{nbsp}}bpc RGB), such as 4K 60{{nbsp}}Hz 10{{nbsp}}bpc (HDR), 4K 120{{nbsp}}Hz, and 8K 60{{nbsp}}Hz, may require the new "Ultra High Speed" or "Ultra High Speed with Ethernet" cables.&lt;ref name="HDMI21Introduction" /&gt; HDMI 2.1's other new features are supported with existing HDMI cables.

The increase in maximum bandwidth is achieved by increasing both the bitrate of the data channels and the number of channels. Previous HDMI versions use three data channels (each operating at up to 6.0{{nbsp}}GHz in HDMI 2.0, or up to 3.4{{nbsp}}GHz in HDMI 1.4), with an additional channel for the TMDS clock signal, which runs at a fraction of the data channel speed (one tenth the speed, or up to 340{{nbsp}}MHz, for signaling rates up to 3.4{{nbsp}}GHz; one fortieth the speed, or up to 150{{nbsp}}MHz, for signaling rates between 3.4 and 6.0{{nbsp}}GHz). HDMI 2.1 doubles the signaling rate of the data channels to 12{{nbsp}}GHz (12{{nbsp}}Gbit/s). The structure of the data has been changed to use a new packet-based format with an embedded clock signal, which allows what was formerly the TMDS clock channel to be used as a fourth data channel instead, increasing the signaling rate across that channel to 12&lt;!--TWELVE IS CORRECT, NOT 1.2--&gt;{{nbsp}}GHz as well. These changes increase the aggregate bandwidth from 18.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s (3 × 6.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s) to 48.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s (4 × 12.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s), a 1.66x &lt;!--1.66 IS CORRECT, NOT 2.66--&gt; increase in bandwidth. In addition, the data is encoded using a 16b/18b scheme as opposed to the 8b/10b scheme used by previous versions, which lets a larger percentage of the bandwidth be used for data rather than DC balancing (88.8% compared to 80%). This, in combination with the 1.66x &lt;!--1.66 IS CORRECT, NOT 2.66--&gt;bandwidth increase, raises the maximum data rate of HDMI 2.1 from 14.4{{nbsp}}Gbit/s to 42.66{{nbsp}}Gbit/s, a ≈1.96x &lt;!--1.96 IS CORRECT, NOT 2.96--&gt;increase.&lt;ref name="HDTVMagazine_HDMI2.1"&gt;{{cite web|title=HDMI 2.1: The Need For Speed Continues|url=http://www.hdtvmagazine.com/columns/2017/01/hdtv-expert-hdmi-21-the-need-for-speed-continues.php|publisher=HDTV Expert|website=HDTV Magazine, Ltd.|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HDGuru_HDMI2.1"&gt;{{cite web|title=HDMI 2.1 To Bring Robust Home Theater Experience|url=https://hdguru.com/hdmi-2-1-to-bring-robust-home-theater-experience/|website=HD Guru|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 48{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth provided by HDMI 2.1 is enough for 8K resolution at approximately 50{{nbsp}}Hz, with 8{{nbsp}}bpc RGB or {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4 color. To achieve even higher formats, HDMI 2.1 can use [[Display Stream Compression]] with a compression ratio of up to 3:1. Using DSC, formats up to 8K (7680{{nbsp}}×{{nbsp}}4320) 120{{nbsp}}Hz or 10K (10240{{nbsp}}×{{nbsp}}4320) 100{{nbsp}}Hz at 8{{nbsp}}bpc RGB/4:4:4 are possible. Using {{YCbCr}} with 4:2:2 or 4:2:0 chroma subsampling in combination with DSC can allow for even higher formats.&lt;ref name="HDMI21January2017Anandtech" /&gt;

===Version comparison===

Note that the "version" of a connection depends on the versions of the HDMI ports on the source and sink devices, not on the HDMI cable. The different categories of HDMI cable only affect the bandwidth (maximum resolution / refresh rate) of the connection. Other features such as audio, 3D, chroma subsampling, or variable refresh rate depend only on the versions of the ports, and are not affected by what type of HDMI cable is used. The only exception to this is Ethernet-over-HDMI, which requires an "HDMI with Ethernet" cable.

Also note that products are not required to implement all features of a version to be considered compliant with that version, as most features are optional. For example, displays with HDMI 1.4 ports do not necessarily support the full 340&amp;nbsp;MHz TMDS clock allowed by HDMI&amp;nbsp;1.4; they are commonly limited to lower speeds such as 300&amp;nbsp;MHz (1080p 120&amp;nbsp;Hz) or even as low as 165&amp;nbsp;MHz (1080p 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) at the manufacturer's discretion, but are still considered HDMI 1.4-compliant. Likewise, features like 10&amp;nbsp;bpc (30&amp;nbsp;bit/px) color depth may also not be supported, even if the HDMI version allows it and the display supports it over other interfaces such as DisplayPort.&lt;ref name="HDMIhometoys" /&gt;

Feature support will therefore vary from device to device, even within the same HDMI version.

====Refresh frequency limits for standard video====

HDMI 1.0 and 1.1 are restricted to transmitting only certain video formats,&lt;ref name="HDMI1.0"/&gt;{{rp|at=§6.1}} defined in EIA/CEA-861-B and in the HDMI Specification itself.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.0"/&gt;{{rp|at=§6.3}} HDMI 1.2 and all later versions allow any arbitrary resolution and frame rate (within the bandwidth limit). Formats that are not supported by the HDMI Specification (i.e., no standardized timings defined) may be implemented as a vendor-specific format. Successive versions of the HDMI Specification continue to add support for additional formats (such as 4K resolutions), but the added support is to establish standardized timings to ensure interoperability between products, not to establish which formats are or aren't permitted. Video formats do not require explicit support from the HDMI Specification in order to be transmitted and displayed.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.2a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§6.1}}

Individual products may have heavier limitations than those listed below, since HDMI devices are not required to support the maximum bandwidth of the HDMI version that they implement. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that a display will support the refresh rates listed in this table, even if the display has the required HDMI version.

Uncompressed 8{{nbsp}}bpc (24{{nbsp}}bit/px) color depth and RGB or {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4 color format are assumed on this table except where noted.

==Applications==

===Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD players===
[[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[HD DVD]], introduced in 2006, offer high-fidelity audio features that require HDMI for best results. HDMI 1.3 can transport [[Dolby Digital Plus]], [[Dolby TrueHD]], and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]] bitstreams in compressed form.&lt;ref name="HDMI1.3a"/&gt;{{rp|at=§7}} This capability allows for an [[AV receiver]] with the necessary decoder to decode the compressed audio stream. The Blu-ray specification does not include video encoded with either deep color or xvYCC; thus, HDMI 1.0 can transfer Blu-ray discs at full video quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hometheatermag.com/hookmeup/hdmi_101/index.html |title=HDMI 101 |publisher=Home Theater Magazine |date=March 1, 2009 |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326080534/http://www.hometheatermag.com/hookmeup/hdmi_101/index.html |archivedate=March 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HDMI 1.4 specification (released in 2009) added support for 3D video and is used by all Blu-ray 3D compatible players.

The Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) spokespersons have stated (Sept. 2014 at IFA show in Berlin, Germany) that the Blu-ray, Ultra HD players, and 4K discs are expected to be available starting in the second half to 2015. It is anticipated that such Blu-ray UHD players will be required to include a HDMI 2.0 output that supports HDCP 2.2.

Blu-ray permits secondary audio decoding, whereby the disc content can tell the player to mix multiple audio sources together before final output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Joshua_Zyber/High-Def_FAQ:_Blu-ray_Profiles_Explained/1186| title=High-Def FAQ: Blu-ray Profiles Explained| first=Joshua| last=Zyber| publisher=highdefdigest.com| date=November 23, 2007| accessdate=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Blu-ray and HD DVD players can decode all of the audio [[codec]]s internally and can output [[Linear pulse code modulation|LPCM]] audio over HDMI. Multichannel LPCM can be transported over an HDMI connection, and as long as the [[AV receiver]] implements multichannel LPCM audio over HDMI and implements [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]], the audio reproduction is equal in resolution to HDMI 1.3 bitstream output. Some low-cost AV receivers, such as the Onkyo TX-SR506, do not allow audio processing over HDMI and are labelled as "HDMI pass through" devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06357/748450-96.stm |title=Sound Advice: Best receiver flying under his radar |author=Don Lindich |publisher=post-gazette now |date=December 23, 2006 |accessdate=June 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.us.onkyo.com/model.cfm?m=TX-SR506&amp;class=Receiver&amp;p=i |title=TX-SR506 |publisher=Onkyo |accessdate=June 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630193330/http://www.us.onkyo.com/model.cfm?m=TX-SR506&amp;class=Receiver&amp;p=i |archivedate=June 30, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all modern AV Receivers now offer HDMI 1.4 inputs and outputs with processing for all of the audio formats offered by Blu-ray Discs and other HD video sources. During 2014 several manufacturers introduced premium AV Receivers that include one, or multiple, HDMI 2.0 inputs along with a HDMI 2.0 output(s). However, not until 2015 did most major manufacturers of AV receivers also support HDCP 2.2 as needed to support certain high quality UHD video sources, such as Blu-ray UHD players.

===Digital cameras and camcorders===
{{as of|2012}}, most consumer camcorders, as well as many digital cameras, are equipped with a mini-HDMI connector (type C connector).

{{as of|2014}}, some cameras also have 4K capability and 3D, even some cameras costing less than US$900. It needs at least a TV/monitor with HDMI 1.4a port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/panasonic-fz1000/panasonic-fz1000A.HTM |title=Panasonic Lumix FZ1000 Review |author=Mike Tomkins and Dave Etchells |accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although often [[HD video]] capable cameras include an HDMI interface for playback or even [[live preview]], the [[image processor]] and the [[video processor]] of cameras usable for uncompressed video must be able to deliver the full [[image resolution]] at the specified [[frame rate]] in [[Real-time computing#Real-time in Digital Signal Processing|real-time]] without any missing frames causing jitter. Therefore, usable uncompressed video out of HDMI is often called "clean HDMI".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tony Northrup's Photography Buying Guide: How to Choose a Camera, Lens, Tripod, Flash, &amp; More|last=Northup|first=Tony|publisher=Mason Press|year=2013|isbn=0988263424|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In December 2010, it was announced that several computer vendors and display makers including [[Intel]], [[AMD]], [[Dell]], [[Lenovo]], [[Samsung]], and [[LG Display|LG]] would stop using [[LVDS]] (actually, [[FPD-Link]]) from 2013 and legacy [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] and [[VGA]] connectors from 2015, replacing them with [[DisplayPort]] and HDMI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technewsworld.com/story/VGA-Given-5-Years-to-Live-71420.html technewsworld.com] – ''VGA Given 5 Years to Live'' (9.

On August 20, 2015, GeForce GTX 950 (with GM206 chip) launched with HDMI 2.0 support.

On May 6, 2016, Nvidia launched the GeForce GTX 1080 (GP104 GPU) with HDMI 2.0b support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geforce.com/hardware/10series/geforce-gtx-1080|title=GeForce GTX 1080 Graphics Cards from NVIDIA GeForce|website=NVIDIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaming consoles===

The [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[Xbox One X]], [[PS3]], [[PS TV]], [[PS4]], [[Wii U]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] consoles support HDMI. Xbox One X is the first commercial available HDMI 2.1 device.

===Tablet computers===
Some [[tablet computer]]s, such as the [[Microsoft Surface]], [[Motorola Xoom]], [[BlackBerry PlayBook]], Vizio Vtab1008 and Acer Iconia Tab A500, implement HDMI using Micro-HDMI (Type D) ports. Others, such as the ASUS [[Eee Pad]] Transformer implement the standard using mini-HDMI (type C) ports. All [[iPad]] models have a special A/V adapter that converts Apple's data line to a standard HDMI (Type A) port. Samsung has a similar proprietary thirty-pin port for their [[Galaxy Tab 10.1]] that can adapt to HDMI as well as USB drives. The [[Dell Streak 5]] smartphone/tablet hybrid is capable of outputting over HDMI. While the Streak uses a [[PDMI]] port, a separate cradle adds HDMI compatibility. Most Chinese-made tablets running [[Android OS]] provide HDMI output using a mini-HDMI (type C) port. Most new laptops and desktops now have built in HDMI as well.

===Mobile phones===
Many recent mobile phones can produce output of HDMI video via either a micro-HDMI connector or [[Mobile High-Definition Link|MHL]] output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung Galaxy S II first with MHL port for dual-purpose USB or HDMI out (video) |publisher=Engadget |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/02/23/samsung-galaxy-s-ii-first-with-mhl-port-for-dual-purpose-usb-or/ |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Battlemodo: HTC EVO 3D Vs LG Optimus 3D |publisher=Gizmodo |url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/09/battlemodo-htc-evo-3d-vs-lg-optimus-3d/ |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=LG Thrill for AT&amp;T: First Look |publisher=PCWorld |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/222897/lg_thrill_for_atandt_first_look.html |date=April 22, 2011 |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Silicon Image's Dual-Mode Port Processors Now Offer MHL Connectivity for Samsung Smart TVs |publisher=Silicon Image |url=http://www.siliconimage.com/news/releasedetails.aspx?id=668 |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=HTC Sensation 4G Review – A Sensational Smartphone |author=Brian Klug |publisher=Anandtech |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4471/htc-sensation-4g-review-a-sensational-smartphone/4 |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dilger|first=Daniel Eran|title=Apple brings HDMI output to iPhone 4, iPad, iPad 2|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/02/apple_brings_hdmi_output_to_iphone_4_ipad_ipad_2/|accessdate=January 4, 2012|newspaper=AppleInsider|date=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Digital AV Adapter|url=http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC953ZM/A|work=Apple Store – United States|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some older phones may use [[SlimPort]] to achieve similar result.

===Legacy compatibility===
HDMI can only be used with older analog-only devices (using connections such as [[SCART]], [[VGA]], RCA, etc.) by means of a [[digital-to-analog converter]] or [[AV receiver]], as the interface does not carry any analog signals (unlike DVI, where devices with DVI-I ports accept or provide either digital or analog signals). Cables are available that contain the necessary electronics, but it is important to distinguish these ''active'' converter cables from ''passive'' HDMI to VGA cables (which are typically cheaper as they don't include any electronics). The passive cables are ''only'' useful if you have a device that is generating or expecting HDMI signals on a VGA connector, or VGA signals on an HDMI connector; this is a non-standard feature, not implemented by most devices.

== HDMI Alternate Mode for USB Type-C ==
The HDMI [[USB-C#Alternate Mode|Alternate Mode]] for [[USB-C]] allows HDMI-enabled sources with a USB-C connector to directly connect to standard HDMI display devices, without requiring an adapter.&lt;ref name="usb.org_HDMI_Alt_Mode"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usb.org/developers/presentations/USB_DevDays_Hong_Kong_2016_-_HDMI_Alt_Mode_USB_Type-C.pdf|title=HDMI Over USB Type-C|date=October 20, 2016|website=usb.org|publisher=HDMI LLC|access-date=May 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard was released in September 2016, and supports all [[#Version 1.4|HDMI 1.4b]] features such as video resolutions up to [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] 30&amp;nbsp;Hz, and Consumer Electronic Control ([[#Consumer Electronics Control (CEC)|CEC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/press_release.aspx?prid=144|title=HDMI Licensing, LLC Releases Alternate Mode for USB Type-C Connector|date=September 1, 2016|website=hdmi.org|access-date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the similar [[DisplayPort]] Alternate Mode could be used to connect to HDMI displays from USB Type-C sources, but where in that case, active adapters were required to convert from DisplayPort to HDMI, HDMI Alternate Mode connects to the display natively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New USB Type-C to HDMI spec lets you ditch the dongle|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/09/usb-type-c-to-hdmi-cable-specs/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=5 May 2017|date=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alternate Mode reconfigures the four SuperSpeed differential pairs present in USB-C to carry the three HDMI [[#Transition-Minimized Differential Signaling (TMDS)|TMDS]] channels and the clock signal. The two Sideband Use pins (SBU1 and SBU2) are used to carry the HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel and the Hot Plug Detect functionality (HEAC+/Utility pin and HEAC−/HPD pin). As there are not enough reconfigurable pins remaining in USB-C to accommodate the [[#Display Data Channel (DDC)|DDC]] clock (SCL), DDC data (SDA), and CEC – these three signals are bridged between the HDMI source and sink via the [[USB#Power Delivery (PD)|USB Power Delivery 2.0]] (USB-PD) protocol, and are carried over the USB-C Configuration Channel (CC) wire.&lt;ref name="usb.org_HDMI_Alt_Mode" /&gt; This is possible because the cable is electronically marked (i.e., it contains a USB-PD node) that serves to tunnel the DDC and CEC from the source over the Configuration Channel to the node in the cable, these USB-PD messages are received and relayed to the HDMI sink as regenerated DDC (SCL and SDA signals), or CEC signals.&lt;ref name="usb.org_HDMI_Alt_Mode" /&gt;

==Relationship with DisplayPort==
[[Image:DisplayPort plus plus.svg|150px|thumb|Dual-mode DisplayPort logo]]
The [[DisplayPort]] audio/video interface was introduced in May 2006. In recent years, DisplayPort connectors have become a common feature of premium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/355806-33-displayport-worth-price|title=Is Displayport worth its price - Displays - Tom's Hardware|website=Tom's Hardware|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; products—displays, desktop computers, and video cards; most of the [[DisplayPort#Supporters|companies producing DisplayPort equipment]] are in the computer sector. The DisplayPort website states that DisplayPort is expected to complement HDMI,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DisplayPort FAQ|publisher=DisplayPort website|url=http://www.displayport.org/FAQ/default.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603131657/http://www.displayport.org/FAQ/default.htm|archivedate=June 3, 2008|accessdate=June 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but {{as of|2016|lc=y}} 100% of HD and UHD TVs had HDMI connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hdmi.org/pdf/HDMI_Alt_Mode_for_USB_Type-C_General_Preso_20161122.pdf|title=Page 5, HDMI Penetration and Market Position 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=HDMI Licensing, LLC|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DisplayPort supported some advanced features which are useful for multimedia content creators and gamers (e.g. 5K, Adaptive-Sync), which was the reason most GPUs had DisplayPort. These features were added to the official HDMI specification slightly later, but with the introduction of HDMI 2.1 these gaps are already leveled off (with e.g. VRR / Variable Refresh Rate).

DisplayPort uses a self-clocking, micro-packet-based protocol that allows for a variable number of differential [[LVDS]] lanes as well as flexible allocation of bandwidth between audio and video, and allows encapsulating multi-channel compressed audio formats in the audio stream.&lt;ref name="DisplayPort_CEA2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.displayport.org/cms/sites/default/files/downloads/DisplayPort_Technical_Overview.pdf |title=DisplayPort Technical Overview, May 2010 |publisher=VESA |date=May 23, 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726000611/http://www.displayport.org/cms/sites/default/files/downloads/DisplayPort_Technical_Overview.pdf |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DisplayPort Technical Overview |publisher=DisplayPort website |url=http://www.displayport.org/white-papers/default.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603131707/http://www.displayport.org/white-papers/default.htm |archivedate=June 3, 2008 |accessdate=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; DisplayPort 1.2 supports multiple audio/video streams, variable refresh rate ([[FreeSync]]), Display Stream Compression (DSC), and Dual-mode LVDS/TDMS transmitters compatible with HDMI 1.2 or 1.4.&lt;ref name="DisplayPort_CEA2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DevCon2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vesa.org/events/developer-conference-presentations-posted/ |title=DisplayPort Developer Conference Presentations Posted |publisher=vesa |date=December 2, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCMagDisplayPort1.2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2357764,00.asp |title=VESA Upgrades DisplayPort Interface |publisher=PCMag |author=Tony Hoffman |date=January 7, 2010 |accessdate=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revision 1.3 increases overall transmission bandwidth to 32.4{{nbsp}}Gbit/s with the new HBR3 mode featuring 8.1{{nbsp}}Gbit/s per lane; it requires Dual-mode with mandatory HDMI 2.0 compatibility and [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]] 2.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/8533/vesa-releases-displayport-13-standard-50-more-bandwidth-new-features |title= VESA Releases DisplayPort 1.3 Standard: 50% More Bandwidth, New Features |date= 16 September 2014 |website= |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vesa.org/uncategorized/vesa-releases-displayport-1-3-standard/|title=VESA Releases DisplayPort 1.3 Standard|author=|date=|work=vesa.org|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revision 1.4 adds support [[BT.2020]] color space and [[HDR10]] extensions from CTA-861.3, including static and dynamic metadata.&lt;ref name="VESAupdateDSC12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vesa-updates-display-stream-compression-standard-to-support-new-applications-and-richer-display-content-300210420.html |title=VESA Updates Display Stream Compression Standard to Support New Applications and Richer Display Content |publisher=PRNewswire |date=27 January 2016 |accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DisplayPort connector is compatible with HDMI and can transmit single-link [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] and HDMI 1.2/1.4/2.0 signals using attached passive adapters or adapter cables.&lt;ref name="DP_Interop"&gt;{{cite news |title=DisplayPort Interoperability Guideline Version 1.1a|publisher=VESA.org |url=http://www.displayport.org |date=February 5, 2009 |accessdate=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DisplayPort_CEA2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DP_Interop" /&gt; The source device includes a dual-mode transmitter that supports both LVDS signals for DisplayPort and TMDS signals for DVI/HDMI. The same external connector is used for both protocols - when a DVI/HDMI passive adapter is attached, the transmitter circuit switches to TDMS mode. [[Dual-Mode DisplayPort|DisplayPort Dual-mode]] ports and cables/adapters are typically marked with the DisplayPort++ logo. [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] ports with [[Mini DisplayPort|mDP]] connector also supports Dual-mode passive HDMI adapters/cables. Conversion to dual-link DVI and [[component video]] (VGA/YPbPr) requires active powered adapters.&lt;ref name="DisplayPort_CEA2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DP_Interop" /&gt;

The USB 3.1 Type-C connector is an emerging standard that replaces legacy video connectors such as mDP, Thunderbolt, HDMI, and VGA in mobile devices. USB-C connectors can transmit DisplayPort video to docks and displays using standard USB Type-C cables or Type-C to DisplayPort cables and adapters; USB-C also supports HDMI adapters that actively convert from DisplayPort to HDMI 1.4 or 2.0. DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C specification was published in 2015. USB Type-C chipsets are not required to include Dual-mode transmitters and only support DisplayPort LVDS protocol, so passive DP-HDMI adapters do not work with Type-C sources.

DisplayPort has a royalty rate of US$0.20 per unit (from patents licensed by MPEG LA), although this claim is contested,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.displayport.org/faq/|title=FAQs - DisplayPort|newspaper=DisplayPort|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while HDMI has an [[#Licensing|annual fee of US$10,000 and a per unit royalty rate of between $0.04 and $0.15]].&lt;ref name=DisplayPortMPEGLicenseMarch2015&gt;{{cite news |title=MPEG LA Introduces License for DisplayPort |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150305006071/en/MPEG-LA-Introduces-License-DisplayPort |date=March 5, 2015 |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HDMI has a few advantages over DisplayPort, such as ability to carry [[#Consumer Electronics Control (CEC)|Consumer Electronics Control (CEC)]] signals, and electrical compatibility with DVI (though practically limited to single-link DVI rates).&lt;ref name="PCMagDisplayPort1.2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DisplayPort 1.1a Standard |publisher=VESA.org |url=http://www.displayport.org |date=January 11, 2008 |accessdate=June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, HDMI can sustain full bandwidth for up to 10 meters of cable length and there are certification programs to ensure this;{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} DisplayPort cables, conversely, don't ensure full bandwidth beyond 3 meters,&lt;ref name="DP.org info 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.displayport.org/cables/how-to-choose-a-displayport-cable-and-not-get-a-bad-one|title=How to Choose a DisplayPort Cable, and Not Get a Bad One!|last=|first=|date=|website=displayport.org|publisher=VESA|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however some ''active'' cables extend the distance to 15 meters at certain resolutions,&lt;ref name="Startech 15m info 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.startech.com/uk/Cables/Audio-Video/DisplayPort/15m-Active-DisplayPort-Cable-M-M~DISPL15MA|title=StarTech - 15m Active DisplayPort Cable - DP to DP M/M|last=|first=|website=StarTech.com|publisher=StarTech|accessdate=2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specialist ''optical'' extender solutions exists to extend distances even farther by sending the signal over [[fiber optic cable]].&lt;ref name="Lindy 200m info 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lindy.co.uk/audio-video-c2/200m-fibre-optic-displayport-1-2-extender-p8863|title=Lindy - 200m Fibre Optic DisplayPort 1.2 Extender|last=|first=|website=Lindy.com|publisher=Lindy|accessdate=2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with MHL==
{{Main|Mobile High-Definition Link}}
Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) is an adaptation of HDMI intended to connect mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to high-definition televisions (HDTVs) and displays.&lt;ref name="MHLSampling2008"&gt;{{cite news |title=HDMI plugs into cameras, cellphones |publisher=EE Times |url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-products/logic-interfaces-products/4101084/HDMI-plugs-into-cameras-cellphones |date=January 8, 2008 |accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mhl-synopsys"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Manmeet Walia|title=MHL: The New Mobile-to-TV Protocol|url=https://www.synopsys.com/designware-ip/newsletters/technical-bulletin/mhl-protocol.html|website=Synopsys.com|accessdate=15 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[DVI]], which is compatible with HDMI using only passive cables and adapters, MHL requires that the HDMI socket be MHL-enabled, otherwise an active adapter (or [[dongle]]) is required to convert the signal to HDMI. MHL is developed by a [[consortium]] of five consumer electronics manufacturers, several of which are also behind HDMI.&lt;ref name="MHL-EETimes2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=Consortium backs mobile interface for high def video |publisher=EE Times |url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4088597/Consortium-backs-mobile-interface-for-high-def-video |date=April 14, 2010 |accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MHL pares down the three TMDS channels in a standard HDMI connection to a single one running over any connector that provides at least five pins.&lt;ref name="MHL-EETimes2010"/&gt; This lets existing connectors in mobile devices – such as [[micro-USB]] – be used, avoiding the need for additional dedicated video output sockets.&lt;ref name="MHLConsortiumWebsiteFAQ"&gt;{{cite news|title=Frequently Asked Questions About MHL |publisher=MHL, LLC |url=http://mhlconsortium.org/about/FAQs.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416050307/http://mhlconsortium.org/about/FAQs.aspx |archivedate=April 16, 2012 |accessdate=January 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The USB port switches to MHL mode when it detects a compatible device is connected.

In addition to the features in common with HDMI (such as [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]] encrypted [[Uncompressed video|uncompressed]] [[high-definition video]] and eight-channel [[7.1 surround sound|surround sound]]), MHL also adds the provision of power charging for the mobile device while in use, and also enables the TV remote to control it. Although support for these additional features requires connection to an MHL-enabled HDMI port, power charging can also be provided when using active MHL to HDMI adapters (connected to standard HDMI ports), provided there is a separate power connection to the adapter.

Like HDMI, MHL defines a [[USB-C]] Alternate Mode to support the MHL standard over USB-C connections.

Version 1.0 supported 720p/1080i 60&amp;nbsp;Hz (RGB/4:4:4 pixel encoding) with a bandwidth of 2.25 Gbit/s. Versions 1.3 and 2.0 added support for [[1080p]] 60&amp;nbsp;Hz ({{YCbCr}} 4:2:2) with a bandwidth of 3 Gbit/s in PackedPixel mode.&lt;ref name="mhl-synopsys"/&gt; Version 3.0 increased the bandwidth to 6 Gbit/s to support [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] (3840 × 2160) 30&amp;nbsp;Hz video, and also changed from being frame-based, like HDMI, to packet-based.&lt;ref name="mhl-hdmi-synopsys"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Manmeet Walia|title=HDMI and MHL IP for Mobile and Digital Home Connectivity|url=https://www.synopsys.com/designware-ip/technical-bulletin/hdmi-and-mhl.html|website=Synopsys.com|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth version, superMHL, increased bandwidth by operating over multiple TMDS differential pairs (up to a total of six) allowing a maximum of 36 Gbit/s.&lt;ref name="superMHL_Whitepaper"&gt;{{cite web|title=superMHL Specification -  White Paper|url=http://www.mhltech.org/docs/superMHL_WhitePaper.pdf|publisher=MHL|accessdate=7 February 2017|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six lanes are supported over a reversible 32-pin superMHL connector, while four lanes are supported over [[USB-C]] Alternate Mode (only a single lane is supported over micro-USB/HDMI). [[Display Stream Compression]] (DSC) is used to allow up to [[8K resolution|8K]] Ultra HD (7680 × 4320) 120&amp;nbsp;Hz HDR video, and to support Ultra HD 60&amp;nbsp;Hz video over a single lane.&lt;ref name="superMHL_Whitepaper"/&gt;

[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Vasanthasena (Oleographic print).jpg|thumb|Vasantasena from the [[Sanskrit]] play ''[[Mṛcchakatika]]''.]]

The '''hooker with a heart of gold''' (also the '''whore with a heart of gold''' or the '''tart with a heart''') is a [[stock character]] involving a [[courtesan]] or [[prostitute]] with a hidden [[integrity]] and kindness.  The character, traditionally female, is usually an example of [[irony]]: an allegedly immoral woman who demonstrates virtues absent in woman morally correct for the role.

==Characteristics==
This character is often a pivotal, but peripheral, character in literature and motion pictures, usually giving key advice or serving as a go-between. She is sometimes established in contrast to another female character who is morally correct but frigid or otherwise unyielding. Hookers with hearts of gold are sometimes reluctant prostitutes due to either desperation or coercion from a [[pimp]]. Or her prostitution may reflect an overall lust for life, as in Ilya in ''[[Never on Sunday]]''.

The stereotype might owe something of a debt to certain traditions surrounding the [[Bible|Biblical]] figures of [[Mary Magdalene]] (who was not a prostitute) and [[Rahab]], or to the ancient [[Theatre in India|Indian theatrical]] tradition of [[Sanskrit drama]] where [[Śudraka]]'s play ''[[Mṛcchakatika]]'' (''The Little Clay Cart'') featured a [[nagarvadhu]] (courtesan) with a heart of gold named Vasantasena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Literature and Popular Cinema|first=Heidi Rika Maria|last=Pauwels|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2008|isbn=0-415-44741-0|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this stock character is pervasive enough in various myths and cultures in the form of a tragic story of the concubine who falls in love with her patron/client or, alternatively, young and often poor lover. Therefore, this might be considered not just an archetype but also fairly universal, and somewhat indicative of various societies' complex ideas about sexual decency and moral character. A variation on the theme, the dancer (stripper) with a heart of gold, is a tamer version of the character.

The fictitious [[courtesan]] [[Chandramukhi (character)]] in [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]]'s highly acclaimed Bengali novel [[Devdas]] has been adapted into film numerous times, most notably into Hindi in 1955 and 2002 with the character-role of "Chandramukhi" being played by actresses [[Vyjayanthimala]] and [[Madhuri Dixit]], respectively. [[Chandramukhi (character)]] here fulfils Devdas' desire of feeling loved which was betrayed by Parvati (Paro).

In opera and musical theater, a hooker with a heart of gold is most often portrayed by a [[mezzo-soprano]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} (One notable exception is the heroine of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[La traviata]]'', Violetta Valery, portrayed by a [[soprano]].) She is portrayed in a tragic light and often dies a tragic death. Another classic example of the "Tart with a heart" character is the character of Nancy in Charles Dickens' novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' and the stage [[musical theatre|musical]] derived from it, ''[[Oliver!]]''.

In television history, the ''"tart with a heart"'' has become an important archetype in serial drama and [[soap opera]], especially in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. During the 1960s, the character of [[Elsie Tanner]] in British series ''[[Coronation Street]]'' set the mold for future characters such as [[Bet Lynch]] (also ''Coronation Street''), [[Kat Moon|Kat Slater]], [[Stacey Slater]] and [[Dawn Swann]] (all three characters from the British soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]''). Characters of this nature are often depicted as having tragic lives, but put on a front when in public to create the illusion of happiness. More often than not, these female characters are vital to their respective shows, and inevitably become some of the biggest stars in British Television.

The hooker with a heart of gold is also a prominent character in many American [[western movies]]. In ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', detective Dave Kujan says to Roger "Verbal" Kint: "... so don't sell me the hooker with a heart of gold."

==Examples==
The story of [[Rahab]] in the Bible's [[Book of Joshua]] is considered by some the earliest example of this character type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=God's Leading Lady|last=Jakes |first=T.D.|year=2003|page=127|quote=She may be the original hooker with the heart of gold|publisher=Berkley Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Giuseppe Verdi's ''La Traviata'', the courtesan Violetta Valery turns to love when she meets Alfredo and subsequently sells all of her possessions to support them (unbeknownst to Alfredo). She is later persuaded to leave him by Alfredo's father Giorgio Germont in order to keep the family's nobility from falling (as her reputation has threatened his daughter's engagement). She is also coping with tuberculosis and keeps this a secret, leaving Alfredo who later comes after her.

In [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s novel ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', protagonist Rodion Raskolnikov is persuaded to confess to murder by the prostitute Sonya Semyonovna Marmeladova, who consistently exhibits characteristics of the archetype throughout the novel.

[[Bertolt Brecht]]'s play ''[[The Good Person of Szechwan]]'' features a textbook example in the form of the young Shen Te, who is rewarded by the gods at the beginning of the play upon demonstrating courtesy when nobody else does, after which she relinquishes whoredom and acquires a tobacco shop—though to ill avail.

The [[Marlene Dietrich]] role "Shanghai Lily" in the 1932 Pre-Code ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]''

Two [[Shirley MacLaine]] roles—Ginny Moorhead in 1958's ''[[Some Came Running]]'' and Irma la Douce in 1963's ''[[Irma la Douce]]''

The "hooker with a heart of gold" also appears as "Cabiria" (played by [[Giulietta Masina]]) in the 1957 film ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]''.

The character appears in modern action films as "Chris" (played by [[Angie Dickinson]]) in the 1967 action film ''[[Point Blank (1967 film)|Point Blank]]'', as "Rosie" (played by [[Maria Bello]]) in the 1999 re-make ''[[Payback (1999 film)|Payback]]'' and as "Donna Quintano" (played by [[Monica Bellucci]]) in ''[[Shoot 'Em Up (film)|Shoot 'Em Up]]'' (2007).

In modern comedy films, [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]'s role in ''[[Trading Places]]'' has been called an example of this archetype,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/276705%7c0/Trading-Places.html|title=Trading Places|last=Soars|first=Emily|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1990 film ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' (starring [[Julia Roberts]] and [[Richard Gere]]) is probably the most recognizable modern depiction of the 'hooker with a heart of gold'. The character "V", played by [[Melanie Griffith]] in the movie ''[[Milk Money (film)|Milk Money]]'' could also be considered an example of this type or role.

''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' is another modern-day film, in which the main character is a courtesan named Satine who does end up having a heart and falling in love, but ultimately (tragically) dies of tuberculosis during one of her performances and never actually gets to be with the one she truly loves.

In the 1970 highly successful Pakistani film, ''[[Anjuman (1970 film)|Anjuman]]'', [[Rani (actress)|Rani]] played the virtuous prostitute "Anjuman". The role was later reprised by [[Sara Loren]], in the [[Anjuman (2013 film)|remake of the film]] in 2013.

In the 1990 film ''[[Pretty Woman]]'', Vivian Ward (played by [[Julia Roberts]]) is portrayed as a kind-hearted prostitute.

A 2003 episode of ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' titled "[[Heart of Gold (Firefly)|Heart of Gold]]" has the crew of ''[[Serenity (Firefly vessel)|Serenity]]'' defending a brothel called the Heart of Gold from a wealthy, [[misogynistic]] local rancher.

Acclaimed Bollywood actor [[Rani Mukerji]] plays the hooker with a golden heart in three films. In ''[[Mangal Pandey: The Rising]]'', she plays a compassionate courtesan. In ''[[Laaga Chunari Mein Daag]]'', she plays a lower middle class woman who turns into a high profile escort. In ''[[Saawariya]]'', Mukerji appeared in a small but highly appreciated cameo of a street-smart prostitute called Gulab.

In the 2004 [[Hindi]] film ''[[Chameli (film)|Chameli]]'', [[Kareena Kapoor]] plays the highly acclaimed golden-hearted prostitute named "Chameli".

The 2010 [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] miniseries ''The Hooker with a Heart of Gold'', by independent filmmaker [[The Cinema Snob|Brad Jones]], takes the proverb literally, in giving the main character – a kind-hearted prostitute simply named "Hooker" (played by Sarah Lewis) – a heart made of gold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecinemasnob.com/the-hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold.html The Hooker with a Heart of Gold]. "The Cinema Snob" Official Site. Retrieved 12 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 Pakistani film ''[[Bol (film)|Bol]]'', actress and model, [[Iman Ali]], played the acclaimed golden-heart prostitute, named, "Sabina (Meena)".

In the 2012 film ''[[Fury (2012 film)|Fury]]'' (originally titled ''The Samaritan'') ex-con Foley (played by [[Samuel L. Jackson]]) falls in love with a disturbed but ultimately good hearted prostitute named Iris (played by [[Ruth Negga]]).

In the 2012 [[Bollywood]] film, [[Talaash: The Answer Lies Within|''Talaash'']]'s main plotline involves around a prostitute, Rosie (also played by Kareena Kapoor).

The songs "[[Carmen (Lana Del Rey song)|Carmen]]" by [[Lana Del Rey]] and "[[The A Team (Ed Sheeran song)|The A Team]]" by [[Ed Sheeran]] each describe such a character.

Madhuravani was a prostitute in [[Gurazada Apparao]]'s popular [[Telugu language|Telugu]] play ''Kanyasulkam'', who was portrayed to be very progressive, opinionated and independent and played a key role in the play.

In ''[[Coronation Street]]'', the characters [[Elsie Tanner]], [[Carla Connor]], [[Bet Lynch]], [[Raquel Watts]] and [[Leanne Battersby]] can be described as such stereotypes.

'''Joe E. Ross''' (born '''Joseph Roszawikz''', March 15, 1914 – August 13, 1982) was an American actor known for his trademark "Ooh! Ooh!" exclamation, which he used in many of his roles. He starred in such TV sitcoms as ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'' and ''[[Car 54, Where Are You?]].''&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Career==
Ross was born on March 15, 1914 to [[Jew]]ish immigrant parents in [[New York, New York]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He dropped out of [[List of high schools in New York City#Manhattan|Seward Park High School]] at age 16 to become a singing waiter at the Van Cortlandt Inn in [[the Bronx]]. When the cafe added a female dancer and singer, Ross was promoted to announcer. He added some jokes and became a comedian.

In 1938, he appeared at the Queens Terrace, near [[Jackson Heights, Queens|Jackson Heights, New York]]. [[Jackie Gleason]] had already been playing there for 16 weeks, and the manager was about to ask Gleason to stay a while longer. Ross heard of the opening, auditioned for it, got the contract, and also stayed 16 weeks. Ross then turned burlesque comic on the Schuster circuit out of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].

His career was interrupted by [[World War II]]. He served in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] at [[Camp Blanding, Florida]], before being stationed in [[England]].

Discharged at the war's end, Ross became an announcer-comic at [[Billy Gray (comedian)|Billy Gray]]'s Band Box in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. He kept his ties to burlesque, and appeared in [[Irving Klaw]]'s feature-length theatrical film ''[[Teaserama]]'' (1955), a re-creation of a burlesque show.

In 1955, Ross worked at a nightclub in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] called Ciro's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2007/novemberdecember/feature/miami-swank%E2%80%94and-its-opposite  'Miami Swank—and Its Opposite' By Thomas Hine "Interior designer George Farkas ... designed Miami Beach’s Ciro’s nightclub"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://denisedanchesfisher.blogspot.com/2012/03/miami-beach-ciros.html Miami Beach "Ciro's"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://areyouinmyphoto.com/photos/details/7183 Ciros, Miami Beach 1949]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://snbauthor.blogspot.com/2012/05/nightclub-ads-long-ago-on-miami-beach.html Nightclubs: Long Ago On Miami Beach, "Ciro's: At Alton Road and Dade Boulevard"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502013545/http://snbauthor.blogspot.com/2012/05/nightclub-ads-long-ago-on-miami-beach.html |date=2014-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was spotted by [[Nat Hiken]] and [[Phil Silvers]], who were planning ''[[The Phil Silvers Show|You'll Never Get Rich]]'' (later known as ''The Phil Silvers Show'' and sometimes ''Sgt. Bilko'') and loved Ross's comedy skills. Ross was hired on the spot and cast as the mess sergeant, Rupert Ritzik.

[[File:Standup-Joe E. Ross-Dave Starr1955.webm|thumb|Joe E. Ross (left) doing part of a routine with Dave Starr in 1955.]]
Ross made Ritzik memorable. Ritzik was henpecked, dumb, and greedy, always an easy mark for Bilko's schemes. Whenever Ritzik had a sudden inspiration, he would hesitate and stammer "Ooh! Ooh!" before articulating his idea. The catch phrase came from the actor's own frustration when he couldn't remember his lines. Silvers would deliberately stray from the scripted dialogue and give Ross the wrong cues, prompting a genuinely confused reaction and an agonized "Ooh! Ooh!" from Ross.

After ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'' ended in 1959, Nat Hiken went on to produce ''[[Car 54, Where Are You?]]'' and cast Joe E. Ross as Patrolman Gunther Toody of New York's 53rd Precinct. [[Fred Gwynne]], another ''Bilko'' alumnus, played Toody's partner, Francis Muldoon. Toody could usually be counted on at some point to say "Ooh! Ooh!", or "Do you mind? Do{{emdash}}you{{emdash}}mind?".  Ross became so identified with his policeman role that he recorded an album of songs entitled "Love Songs from a Cop". [[Roulette Records]] released the LP in 1964. Ross did the voice for Toody for the episode "Car 54" of Hanna-Barbera's ''[[Wait Till Your Father Gets Home]]'', in which Toody and Muldoon moonlight running a day care center and one of the children turns up missing.

Ross also starred as Gronk in [[Sherwood Schwartz]]'s ill-fated 1966 sitcom ''[[It's About Time (TV series)|It's About Time]]'', which featured two 1960s American [[astronauts]] who were thrown back in time to the [[prehistoric]] era.

Following the breakup of [[Allen &amp; Rossi]] in 1968, [[Steve Rossi]] teamed for less than three months with Ross in an act called "Rossi &amp; Ross".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=11diCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=Steve%20rossi%20joe%20e%20ross&amp;pg=PA297#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Obiturary for Steve Rossi]," Obituaries in the Performing Arts, 2014 by Harris M. Lentz III, McFarland, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Rossi &amp; Ross played once on Ed Sullivan and disbanded in January 1969.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2011/01/king-of-slobs.html Joe E. Ross Biography]; retrieved January 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ross also was a prominent cartoon voice into the 1970s, playing the stereotypical bumbling sergeant in many cartoons such as ''[[Hong Kong Phooey]]'' (as Sgt. Flint) and ''[[Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch!]]'' (as Botch). He also voiced Roll on CB Bears segment Shake, Rattle and Roll. His "Ooh! Ooh!" phrase was emulated by [[Frank Welker]] in the animated series ''[[Fangface]]''. He was also one of the few white comedians with 1970's label [[Laff Records]], which specialized in African-American comedians and released his album ''Should Lesbians Be Allowed to Play Pro-Football?''.&lt;ref name=king&gt;"[http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2011/01/king-of-slobs.html King of Slobs: The Life of Joe E. Ross]," by Listener Kliph Nesteroff, WFMU, January 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ross was often known as a difficult person to work with.&lt;ref name=king/&gt; Co-workers complained that he was continually vulgar, even cursing around children.&lt;ref name=king/&gt; Others, however, called him "a man of sweet character".&lt;ref name=king/&gt;

==Death==
Ross died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on August 13, 1982 while performing in the clubhouse of his apartment building in Los Angeles, The Oakwood Apartments.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Joe E.

[[Jay Leno]] delivered the eulogy. Ross' gravestone is inscribed with the [[double entendre]] "This man had a ball".&lt;ref name=king/&gt;&lt;ref name="Find a Grave"&gt;{{Find a Grave|1605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kabam''' (formerly '''Watercooler, Inc.''') is an interactive entertainment company founded in 2006 and headquartered in Vancouver, BC. with offices in San Francisco, CA and Austin, Texas.
The company creates, develops and publishes massively multiplayer social games (MMSG’s) such as ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions|Marvel Contest of Champions]]'' for mobile devices. Before expanding into gaming, Kabam established itself as a social applications developer with entertainment and sports communities totaling more than 60 million users.
Kabam markets [[freemium]] games for mobile devices, and [[social networking service]]s,. The company's previous investors included Alibaba, Canaan Partners, Google, MGM, Intel, Pinnacle Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Warner Bros. and others.

The company has focused on developing "real games," or games with immersive gameplay mechanics akin to more traditional [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMOs]] with an emphasis on the spending and [[gambling]] of [[virtual currency]]. In late 2009, Kabam launched ''Kingdoms of Camelot'', one of the first successful strategy games on [[Facebook]], but in June 2010, the number of players began constantly shrinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidesocialgames.com/2010/06/16/verdonia-game-facebook-playdom/|title=Playdom Reaches Out to Strategy Gamers with Verdonia|publisher=Inside Social Games|date=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2015, Kabam announced a shift in its focus to developing AAA mobile games.&lt;ref name="kabam3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Chou|url=http://corporate.kabam.com/blog/fewer-bigger-bolder-kabam-is-singularly-focused-on-aaa-mobile-games/|title=Fewer, Bigger, Bolder: Kabam is Singularly Focused on AAA Mobile Games|publisher=Kabam|date=2015-04-20|accessdate=2015-06-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628034654/http://corporate.kabam.com/blog/fewer-bigger-bolder-kabam-is-singularly-focused-on-aaa-mobile-games/|archivedate=2015-06-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, Kabam announced that Marvel Contest of Champions hit $100 million in gross revenue in seven months, the fastest of any game in Kabam history (The Hobbit was next fastest at 13 months).

As of December 19, 2016, Kabam's Vancouver Studio was acquired by [[Netmarble Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-20-netmarble-buys-kabams-vancouver-studio/|title=Netmarble buys Kabam's Vancouver studio|website=gamesindustry.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Kabam was founded in 2006 as Watercooler by [[Kevin Chou]], Michael Li, [[Holly Liu]], and Wayne Chan, the company started off focused on building community apps for sports and entertainment fans, amassing more than 25 million users on [[Facebook]] and other social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2009/10/26/daily4.html|title=Sports fantasty social startup Watercooler raises $5.5M|publisher=San Jose Business Journal|date=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009 Watercooler, secured $5.5 million in Series B funding from [[Betfair]], the world’s largest Internet betting exchange, and Canaan Partners, which participated in the company’s Series A funding in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/10/25/watercooler-raises-55-m-to-create-fan-communities-and-social-games/|title=Watercooler raises $5.5M to expand social fantasy sports game business|publisher=VentureBeat|date=October 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2, 2009 Watercooler, launched ''[[Kingdoms of Camelot]]'' on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/games/kingdoms-of-camelot/web-70631 |title=Kingdoms of Camelot – Web Games – IGN |publisher=Ca.ign.com |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2010, Watercooler changed its name to Kabam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Morrison |url=http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/watercooler-changes-name-kabam-deeper-social-games/572686 |title=Watercooler Changes Its Name to Kabam, Focuses in on Deeper Social Games &amp;#124; SocialTimes |publisher=Adweek.com |date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Wayne Chan, one of Kabam's co-founders, left the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.crunchbase.com/person/wayne-chan |title=Wayne Chan |publisher=CrunchBase|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then on September 19, 2012, CEO Kevin Chou announced that Kabam was considering an [[IPO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-18/kabam-weighs-ipo-as-game-maker-expands-beyond-facebook.html|title=Kabam Weighs IPO as Game Maker Expands Beyond Facebook|publisher=Bloomberg|date=September 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A secondary stock sale was agreed at the end of 2013 which valued the company at $700 million, it was also announced at this time that four of its games – led by ''Kingdoms of Camelot'' – grossed more than $100 million, with $360 million in revenues for 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/10/free-to-play-games-company-kabam-buys-phoenix-age-as-it-pushes-for-650m-in-2014-sales/ |title=Free-To-Play Games Company Kabam Buys Phoenix Age As It Pushes For $650M In 2014 Sales |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2014-03-10 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Kabam hired former [[Electronic Arts|EA]] Mobile VP [[Aaron Loeb]] as Senior Vice President of its North American Studios (San Francisco and Vancouver), while at EA Mobile he worked on The Simpsons: Tapped Out and Monopoly Slots, Kabam hoped he would provide a link to Hollywood Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former EA VP Aaron Loeb joins free-to-play mobile company Kabam|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/24/5837756/former-ea-vp-aaron-loeb-joins-free-to-play-mobile-company-kabam|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in June, Kabam shut down servers for ''The Hobbit: Armies of the Third Age''.&lt;ref name="kabam1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castleageforums.com/cforum/showthread.php?74646-Kabam-pulls-the-plug |title=Kabam pulls the plug |date=2014-05-22 |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]] announced in July 2014 that it planned to invest $120 million in Kabam, giving the company a $1 billion valuation. This allowed its games to be distributed through Alibaba's apps, including [[Taobao|Mobile Taobao]] and the [[Alibaba Group#Laiwang|Laiwang]] messaging app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alibaba pours $120M into Kabam to challenge Tencent|url=http://seekingalpha.com/news/1891675-alibaba-pours-120m-into-kabam-to-challenge-tencent|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2015, Kabam is only focused on developing AAA mobile games. As a result, a number of Kabam games were shut down, older Kabam games transferred to other companies and Kabam support for third-party games decreased.&lt;ref name="kabam3" /&gt;

On January 7, 2016, Kabam announced it had sold its legacy games and third party-published games to Chinese publisher GAEA Mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ric Cowley|url=http://www.pocketgamer.biz/news/62535/kabam-sells-old-titles-to-gaea-mobile/|title=Kabam continues to narrow focus, offloading old mobile titles to Gaea Mobile|publisher=Pocket Gamer|date=2016-01-08|accessdate=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the downsizing in April 2015, Kabam shut down a number of older games that were not transferred.

On February 22, 2016, Kabam laid off 8 percent of its company workforce. Kevin Chou, Kabam's chief executive, said in an exclusive interview with [[GamesBeat]] that the company will focus on free-to-play massively multiplayer mobile games such as its current hits, Marvel: Contest of Champions and Star Wars: Uprising. That means Kabam will put less emphasis on single-player games such as ''Fast &amp; Furious''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dean Takahashi|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/02/22/kabam-lays-off-8-as-it-focuses-on-massively-multiplayer-mobile-games/|title=Kabam lays off 8% as it focuses on massively multiplayer mobile hits like Marvel: Contest of Champions|publisher=VentureBeat|date=2016-02-22|accessdate=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2016, Kabam announced that they would be selling [[Realm of the Mad God]] to DECA Games.

'''''Laughter''''' is a collection of three essays by French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]], first published in 1900. It was written in French, the original title is ''Le Rire. Essai sur la signification du comique'' ("Laughter, an essay on the meaning of the comic").

== Publication ==
The three essays were first published in the French review ''Revue de Paris''. A book was published in 1924 by the Alcan publishing house. It was reprinted in 1959 by the [[Presses Universitaires de France]], on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Bergson.

In a [[foreword]] published in 1900, but suppressed in 1924, Bergson explains that through the three articles, he wanted to study [[laughter]], especially the laughter caused by the comic, and to determine the principal categories of comic situations, to determine the laws of the comic. He also added a list of works and [[Laughter in literature|studies about laughter]] and the comic.

In the [[preface]] written in 1924 to replace the initial foreword, Bergson explains that his method is entirely new because it consists in determining the process of the comic instead of analyzing the effects of the comic. He specifies that his method does not contradict the results of the other one, but he assumes that it is more rigorous from a scientific point of view. He adds a larger bibliography.

== First essay ==
The first essay is made up of three parts:
# ''Du comique en général'' (Of the comic in general)
# ''Le comique des formes et le comique des mouvements'' (The comedy of forms and the comedy of movements)
# ''Force d’expansion du comique'' (The expansive force of the comic)

In a short introduction, Bergson announces that he will try to define the comic, but he does not want to give a rigid definition of the word; he wants to deal with the comic as part of [[Human condition|human life]]. His ambition is also to have a better knowledge of society, of the functioning of human [[imagination]] and of collective imagination, but also of art and life.&lt;ref&gt;«Et peut-être trouverons-nous aussi que nous avons fait, sans le vouloir, une connaissance utile. Raisonnable, à sa façon, jusque dans ses plus grands écarts, méthodique dans sa folie, rêvant, je le veux bien, mais évoquant en rêve des visions qui sont tout de suite acceptées et comprises d’une société entière, comment la fantaisie comique ne nous renseignerait-elle pas sur les procédés de travail de l’imagination humaine, et plus particulièrement de l’imagination sociale, collective, populaire ? Issue de la vie réelle, apparentée à l’art, comment ne nous dirait-elle pas aussi son mot sur l’art et sur la vie ?», Henri Bergson, ''Le Rire''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''General facts on the comic'''

Bergson begins to note three facts on the comic:
* the comic is strictly a human phenomenon. A landscape cannot be a source of laughter, and when humans make fun of animals, it is often because they recognize some human behaviour in them. Man is not only a being that can laugh, but also a being that is a source of laughter.
* laughter requires an indifference, a detachment from sensibility and emotion: it is more difficult to laugh when one is fully aware of the seriousness of a situation.
* it is difficult to laugh alone, it is easier to laugh collectively. One who is excluded from a group of people does not laugh with them; there is often a complicity in laughter. Thus, the comic is not a mere pleasure of the intellect, it is a human and social activity; it has a social meaning.

'''The social role of laughter'''

Bergson now assumes that the comic requires the use of intelligence instead of sensibility, and he tries to determine what is the real role of intelligence in a comic situation. He takes the example of a man falling down in the street in front of passers-by. Laughter is caused by an accidental situation, caused by a movement. The source of the comic is the presence of a rigidity in life. Life is defined by Bergson a perpetual movement, it is characterized by flexibility and agility. Comic situations, such as that of a falling man, are situations where movement is not flexible.

However, the comic is not only based upon unusual situations, but also upon characters and individuals. Bergson takes the example of absent-minded people, a common source of comedy. People tend to associate individuals with a comic character, which increases the comic. In addition, when we make fun of somebody for one of his vices, it is because the individual is unaware of his own vice while we are aware of it. Thus laughter forces people to be better and to suppress their vices, because laughter makes them be conscious of them. This is why Bergson asserts that laughter has a moral role, it is a factor of uniformity of behaviours, it eliminates ludicrous and eccentric attitudes : « Beyond actions and attitudes that are automatically punished by their natural consequences, there remains a certain inflexibility of the body, of the mind and of the character that society would like to eliminate to obtain a greater elasticity and a better sociability of its members. This inflexibility is the comic, laughter is the punishment ».

'''Comic and forms of materiality'''

Laughter can be caused by ugliness, but ugliness is not always comic. To laugh about ugliness, we need to have a naive, immediate, original approach, not to think. We also have to focus on a specific feature of the person and to associate the person with this feature. It is the same with cartoonists, who exaggerate physical and natural features of people. Our imagination sees in everyone the efforts of the soul to dynamise materiality, the soul or the mind give flexibility, agility and animation to the rigid body and to materiality. However the body tends to rigidify itself, and it produces a comic effect: « When materiality succeeds in fixing the movement of the soul, in hindering its grace, it obtains a comic effect. To define comic in comparison to its contrary, we should oppose it to grace instead of beauty. It is stiffness rather than ugliness ».

'''Comic of gesture and movements'''

Bergson concludes as an immediate consequence of the previous chapter that « attitudes, gestures and movements of the human body are subject to laughter precisely in the way that body makes us think to a simple machine ». Humans tend to laugh when they see the effect of a machine within the human body. This is why when we concentrate our attention on a particular gesture made by a speaker to better express his thinking, we automatically find it comic whereas this movement in itself is not comic. We also laugh when someone imitates somebody else, because to imitate somebody, the imitator reproduces the most mechanical, the most unconscious movements and gestures of the person. This is also the case with the parody of an activity. For Bergson, this explains also why, as [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] had noted, when we see two faces that look like very much, we find it comic, while the faces alone are not comic.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsi se résout la petite énigme proposée par Pascal dans un passage des Pensées : « Deux visages semblables, dont aucun ne fait rire en particulier, font rire ensemble par leur ressemblance. » Henri Bergson: ''Le Rire. Essai sur la signification du comique'', [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Rire._Essai_sur_la_signification_du_comique/Chapitre_I._%E2%80%94_IV Chapitre I]&lt;/ref&gt; And finally: « This is because really lively life is not supposed to repeat itself. Where there is repetition, complete similarity, we suspect that there is mechanism behind life. That diversion of life towards mechanism is the real cause of laughter. »

'''The comic and human imagination'''

At the beginning of chapter five, Bergson thinks again about his method of analysis. He recalls that to look for a unique method of the comic does not make sense. However, there is a central cause of the comic, and all comic situations are derived from it. This central cause is mechanism applied to life, and all comic effects are articulated around this cause by our imagination. There are three main directions in which our imagination is oriented to produce comic effects, three general laws:
* a lot of things are comic ''en droit'' ([[de jure]]) whereas they are not comic ''en fait'' (de facto), because common use and collective habits generalize these comic situations. Hence the mind needs to break with fashion to revive and to note the comedy of the situation, not to create it, Bergson insists. He takes the example of clothes: fashionable clothes do not make us laugh, because we are used to seeing them, while we automatically make fun of someone who wears old-fashioned clothes. Also the application of social conventions and rules are comic situation because these regulations and applied automatically, mechanically. « A mechanism inserted into nature, an automatic regulation of society, these are the two kinds of funny effects at which we are ending up. »
* contrary to the body, the soul is perfectly flexible, always in activity. However, we tend to attribute these qualities to the body, we considerer it as flexible and ignore his resistance, its materiality. But when we are fully aware that the body is a weigh, a burden for the soul, the situation is comic.&lt;ref&gt;Mais supposons qu’on appelle notre attention sur cette matérialité du corps. Supposons qu’au lieu de participer de la légèreté du principe qui l’anime, le corps ne soit plus à nos yeux qu’une enveloppe lourde et embarrassante, lest importun qui retient à terre une âme impatiente de quitter le sol. Alors le corps deviendra pour l’âme ce que le vêtement était tout à l’heure pour le corps lui-même, une matière inerte posée sur une énergie vivante. Et l’impression du comique se produira dès que nous aurons le sentiment net de cette superposition. Nous l’aurons surtout quand on nous montrera l’âme taquinée par les besoins du corps, — d’un côté la personnalité morale avec son énergie intelligemment variée, de l’autre le corps stupidement monotone, intervenant et interrompant avec son obstination de machine. Plus ces exigences du corps seront mesquines et uniformément répétées, plus l’effet sera saisissant. Bergson, ''[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Rire._Essai_sur_la_signification_du_comique/Chapitre_I._%E2%80%94_V Le Rire]'', Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, « is comic any incident which attracts our attention on the physique of a person while the mind is active ». There is a comic effect when our attention is diverted from the mind to the physique.
* we laugh every time somebody looks like a material thing, every time we are under the impression that someone is a thing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2680">A '''marketing holiday''' is an [[unofficial holiday]] which someone invents and promotes in the media. The point of the holiday is for typical users, community organizers, and marketers to share information within a theme. 

While marketing holidays are often billed as "National days", they do not celebrate the creation of nations or non-sovereign countries—and must be disambiguated from a [[National day]] and [[Public holiday]].

Marketing holidays can generate large revenue spikes for e-commerce sites. In 2017 the [[Alibaba Group]] reported US$25.4 billion in sales on commercial holiday [[Singles Day]].

'''''Mazes of Fate''''' is a first-person [[role-playing video game]] developed by Argentinian studio Sabarasa and published by [[Graffiti Entertainment]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. The Game Boy Advance version was released exclusively in [[North America]] on December 12, 2006.

A reconversion titled '''''Mazes of Fate DS''''' was released for the [[Nintendo DS]] on July 25, 2008 in Europe and on September 9, 2008 in North America. Improvements included fixes for many bugs present in the original GBA version of the game, 3D engine used in dungeons instead of the original tile-based 2D engine, many new secret areas in dungeons, and several new dungeon maps.

==Gameplay==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

''Mazes of Fate'' is a real-time first-person role-playing game in which the player takes controls of up to three characters. It bears similarities to older games in its genre, including ''[[Eye of the Beholder (computer game)|Eye of the Beholder]]''. When the player starts the game, he or she can either choose from three different pre-generated characters - a Warrior, a Rogue, and a Mage - or create a custom character. The Warrior's abilities are tilted towards power, the Rogue's abilities are tilted towards speed and thief-related abilities, and the Mage's abilities are tilted towards magic and spells. In the DS version of the game, the number of pre-generated characters player may choose from is increased to seven. In addition to the original three characters, he or she can also play as a Priest, an Assassin (an agile warrior using mostly daggers and knives), a Valkyrie (a different type of warrior specializing in two-handed and ranged weapons), or as an alternative type of Warrior specializing in two-handed weapons.&lt;br&gt;
The game has three different types of areas the player can explore - dungeons, the overworld, and civilized locations. The dungeons are the primary area where battles are fought, the overworld is a hub which leads to dungeons and civilized locations, and civilized locations often act to advance the story and purchase and sell items.

'''Nice Ideas''' was a video game company based in [[France]]. 

Originally a part of [[Mattel Electronics]], they were sold to an unknown company after the [[video game crash of 1983]]. Mattel was not allowed to shut down Nice Ideas like the rest of Mattel Electronics due to French law. It is believed Nice Ideas continued making new, unreleased games such as [[Pizzatime]] and [[Masters of the Universe]] during this time.

At the time of the shutdown, Mattel Electronics sold the rights to [[Illusions (video game)|Illusions]], [[BurgerTime]], and [[Bump 'n' Jump]] to [[Coleco]].

'''NightWash''' is a German [[stand-up comedy]] "Mix" show, in which stand-up comedians are typically given 7-10 minute spots.  The show was originally staged in a coin-operated Laundromat in the [[Belgian Quarter]] of [[Cologne]].  The show has gone on to be televised, first by local broadcasters [[WDR Fernsehen]], by the German branch of [[Comedy Central]] and currently by German public broadcaster [[Einsfestival]]. The show is presented by its creator, [[KJ Deuser|Klaus-Jürgen "Knacki" Deuser]], along with ''house band'' Alex Flucht on guitar.  The show is well-known due to a number of famous German stand-up comedians making their first appearances there, and it is generally considered an important step in the career of a comedian to perform at Nightwash.&lt;ref name="Interview with KJ Deuser"&gt;[http://www.pressesau.de/index.php?action=1113598113 Interview mit Knacki Deuser über ''NightWash'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The original show was started in 2000 as an [[open-mic]] night, to give stage time to new stand-up comedians - due to stand-up comedy being a fairly new form in Germany, very few open-mic nights existed at that time.  The show was originally sited in a Laundromat, as it was thought that this would give the show a captive audience, due to people waiting for their washing to finish.  The original laundromat, sited in Brusseler Platz, was closed in 2007.  It was not the nearby "Cleanicum" Laundromat, as has oft been misreported, which is on the opposite side of Brusseler Pl.

==NightWash TV==
[[NightWash|In 2000, the show was picked up by WDR Fernsehen]], and featured regularly as part of WDR's comedy programming until 2006.  From 2006 until 2008 the show was a regular feature of the German arm of Comedy Central. Since November 2009, NightWash is being aired by German public broadcaster [[Einsfestival]].

The production firm behind Nightwash, D'nA Productions, was acquired by Brainpool TV in 2006.&lt;ref name="Brainpool TV acquisition"&gt;[http://www.brainpool.de/bpo/en/unternehmen/geschichte/#_2007 Brainpool TV History 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===NightWash Special===
The ''NightWash Special'' is a further development of the format, where the programme concentrates on one comedian, who performs for a complete half-hour.  The show is recorded in front of a live audience.

===NightWash Schleudergang===
Since December 2009, Einsfestival produces best ofs titled "NightWash Schleudergang".

==NightWash Live==
Since 2008, the show has been staged in a similar laundromat (the Eco-Express Waschsalon) in the [[Zollstock]] area of Cologne, at Höninger Str. 134.  Admission is free, and the show generally attracts a large audience of students from the nearby University.  The show takes place every fortnight and is also streamed live through the internet. Clips from it are regularly featured on the Nightwash Live section of the website, as well as on YouTube and the myspass.de website.

==Nightwash on Tour==
A regular Nightwash tour takes place twice a year, in which a group of comedians accompany KJ Deuser and Flucht.

==Nightwash Club==
Regular shows also take place under the banner of ''Nightwash Club'' in twenty separate German cities.  These shows feature an ever-changing lineup and guest presenters.

[[File:WarnePantomine1890.jpg|thumb|220px|''The Christmas Pantomime'' colour [[lithograph]] book cover, 1890, showing the [[harlequinade]] characters]]
'''Pantomime''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|n|t|ə|m|aɪ|m}}; informally '''panto''')&lt;ref&gt;Lawner, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[musical theatre|musical comedy]] stage production designed for family entertainment. It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom and (to a lesser extent) in other English-speaking countries, especially during the Christmas and New Year season. Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing. It employs gender-crossing actors and combines topical humour with a story more or less based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or [[Folklore|folk tale]].&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid-Walsh, Jacqueline. "Pantomime", ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', Jack Zipes (ed.), Oxford University Press (2006), {{ISBN|9780195146561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer (1969), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers.

Pantomime has a long theatrical history in Western culture dating back to classical theatre. It developed partly from the 16th century [[commedia dell'arte]] tradition of Italy and other European and British stage traditions, such as 17th-century [[masque]]s and [[music hall]].&lt;ref name=Reid/&gt; An important part of the pantomime, until the late 19th century, was the [[harlequinade]].&lt;ref name=HistoryIBY/&gt;

Outside Britain, the word "pantomime" is often understood to mean [[Mime artist|miming]], rather than the theatrical form discussed here.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Webster's New World Dictionary]]'', World Publishing Company, 2nd College Edition, 1980, p. 1027.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman pantomime==
[[File:Ancient Macedonian antefix 2nd century A.D.jpg|thumb|left|upright|2nd-century Macedonian theatrical sculpture, thought to represent a pantomime's mask]]
The word pantomime was adopted from  the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''pantomimus'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' ''s.v.'' [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/137038?rskey=LW1qpR pantomime]&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''παντόμιμος'' (''pantomimos''), consisting of ''παντο-'' (''panto-'') meaning "all", and ''μῖμος'' (''mimos''), meaning a dancer who acted all the roles or all the story.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brittanica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/art/pantomimus  ''Pantomimus''], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Henry George and Robert Scott. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpanto%2Fmimos παντόμιμος], ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'', Perseus Digital Library, accessed 16 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman pantomime drew upon the Greek tragedy and other Greek genres from its inception, although the art was instituted in Rome and little is known of it in pre-Roman Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, pp. 40-42, 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, pp. 21–34.&lt;/ref&gt; The English word came to be applied to the performance itself.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} According to a lost oration by [[Aelius Aristides]], the pantomime was known for its erotic content and the effeminacy of its dancing;&lt;ref&gt;Mesk, J., ''Des Aelius Aristides Rede gegen die Tänzer'', WS 30 (1908)&lt;/ref&gt; Aristides's work was responded to by [[Libanius]], in his oration "On Behalf of the Dancers", written probably around 361 AD.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Roman pantomime was a production, usually based upon myth or legend, for a solo male dancer—clad in a long silk tunic and a short mantle (''pallium'') that was often used as a [[Theatrical property|"prop"]]—accompanied by a sung ''libretto'' (called the ''fabula saltica'' or "dance-story") rendered by a singer or [[Greek chorus|chorus]] (though [[Lucian of Samosata|Lucian]] states that originally the pantomime himself was the singer).&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Music was supplied by flute and the [[pulse (music)|pulse]] of an iron-shod shoe called a [[scabellum]]. Performances might be in a private household, with minimal personnel, or else lavish theatrical productions involving a large orchestra and chorus and sometimes an ancillary actor. The dancer danced all the roles, relying on masks, stock poses and gestures and a hand-language (cheironomy) so complex and expressive that the pantomime's hands were commonly compared to an eloquent mouth.&lt;ref name=AncientReception&gt;Alessandra Zanobi.

Roman pantomime was immensely popular from the end of the first century BC until the end of the sixth century AD,&lt;ref name=AncientReception/&gt; a form of entertainment that spread throughout the empire where, because of its wordless nature, it did more than any other art to foster knowledge of the myths and Roman legends that formed its subject-matter – tales such as those of the love of [[The Loves of Mars and Venus|Venus and Mars]] and of [[Aeneid|Dido and Aeneas]] – while in Italy its chief exponents were celebrities, often the protegés of influential citizens, whose followers wore badges proclaiming their allegiance and engaged in street-fights with rival groups, while its accompanying songs became widely known.{{Failed verification|date=April 2016}} Yet, because of the limits imposed upon Roman citizens' dance, the populism of its song-texts and other factors, the art was as much despised as adored,&lt;ref name=AncientReception/&gt; and its practitioners were usually slaves or freedmen.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Because of the low status and the disappearance of its ''libretti'', the Roman pantomime received little modern scholarly attention until the late 20th century, despite its great influence upon Roman culture as perceived in Roman art, in statues of famous dancers, graffiti, objects and literature.&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt; After the renaissance of classical culture, Roman pantomime was a decisive influence upon modern European [[concert dance]], helping to transform ballet from a mere entertainment, a display of technical virtuosity, into the dramatic [[ballet d'action]]. It became an antecedent which, through writers and ballet-masters of the 17th and 18th centuries such as Claude-François Ménestrier (1631–1705), John Weaver (1673–1760), [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] (1727–1810) and Gasparo Angiolini (1731–1803), earned it respectability and attested to the capability of dance to render complex stories and express human emotion.&lt;ref name=AncientReception/&gt;

==Development of pantomime in Britain==
In the Middle Ages, the [[Mummers Play]] was a traditional English folk play, based loosely on the [[Saint George and the Dragon]] legend, usually performed during Christmas gatherings, which contained the origin of many of the archetypal elements of the pantomime, such as stage fights, coarse humour and fantastic creatures,&lt;ref&gt;Barrow, Mandy.

===''Commedia dell'arte'' and early English pantomime===
[[File:Richarlequin.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] as Harlequin, c. 1720]]
The development of English pantomime was also strongly influenced by the continental ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'', a form of popular theatre that arose in Italy in the [[Early Modern Period]].  This was a "comedy of professional artists" travelling from province to province in Italy and then France, who improvised and told comic stories that held lessons for the crowd, changing the main character depending on where they were performing. Each "scenario" used some of the same stock characters. These included the ''[[innamorati]]'' (young lovers); the ''vecchi'' (old men) such as [[Pantalone]]; and ''zanni'' (servants) such as [[Arlecchino]], [[Colombina]], [[Scaramouche]] and [[Pierrot]].&lt;ref name=Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name=ox&gt;Mayer, David. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t177.e2999 "Pantomime, British"], ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Theatre and Performance'', Oxford University Press, 2003, accessed 21 October 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian masque performances in the 17th century sometimes included the [[Harlequin]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, adaptations of the commedia characters became familiar in English entertainments.&lt;ref name=vanda&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/e/early-pantomime/ "Early pantomime"], Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed 21 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; From these, the standard English [[harlequinade]] developed, depicting the eloping lovers [[Harlequin]] and [[Harlequinade#Columbine|Columbine]], pursued by the girl's father [[Harlequinade#Pantaloon|Pantaloon]] and his comic servants [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] and [[Harlequinade#Pierrot|Pierrot]].&lt;ref name=vanda/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; In English versions, by the 18th century, Harlequin became the central figure and romantic lead.&lt;ref name=cox&gt;Hartnoll, Phyllis and Peter Found (eds). [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t79.e1417 "Harlequinade",] ''The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre'', Oxford Reference Online, Oxford University Press, 1996, accessed 21 October 2011. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic plot of the harlequinade remained essentially the same for more than 150 years, except that a bumbling policeman was added to the chase.&lt;ref name=vanda/&gt;

In the first two decades of the 18th century, two rival London theatres, [[Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre]] and the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] (the [[patent theatre]]s) presented productions that began seriously with classical stories that contained elements of opera and ballet and ended with a comic "night scene". ''Tavern Bilkers'', by [[John Weaver (dancer)|John Weaver]], the dancing master at Drury Lane, is cited as the first pantomime produced on the English stage.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, chapter 14. Broadbent spends the first half of his book tracing the ancient and European origins of pantomime.&lt;/ref&gt; This production was not a success, and Weaver waited until 1716 to produce his next pantomimes, including ''The Loves of Mars and Venus – a new Entertainment in Dancing after the manner of the Antient Pantomimes''.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt; The same year he produced a pantomime on the subject of ''[[Andromeda (play)|Perseus and Andromeda]]''. After this, pantomime was regular feature at Drury Lane.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, chapter 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1717 at Lincoln's Inn, actor and manager [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] introduced [[Harlequinade#Harlequin|Harlequin]] into the theatres' pantomimes under the name of "Lun" (for "lunatic").&lt;ref name=rich&gt;Dircks, Phyllis T. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/23486 "Rich, John (1692–1761)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2011, accessed 21 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaffee278&gt;Chaffee and Crick, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; He gained great popularity for his pantomimes, especially beginning with his 1724 production of ''The Necromancer; or, History of Dr. Faustus''.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, chapter 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

These early pantomimes were silent, or "dumb show", performances consisting of only dancing and gestures. Spoken drama was allowed in London only in the two (later three) patent theatres until Parliament changed this restriction in 1843.&lt;ref name="East London Theatre Archive"&gt;Haill, Catherine. [http://www.elta-project.org/theme-panto.html ''Pantomime''], University of East London, accessed 17 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of French performers played in London following the suppression of unlicensed theatres in Paris.&lt;ref name="ox"/&gt; Although this constraint was only temporary, English pantomimes remained primarily visual for some decades before dialogue was introduced. An 18th-century author wrote of [[David Garrick]]: "He formed a kind of harlequinade, very different from that which is seen at the [[Opéra-Comique]] in Paris, where harlequin and all the characters speak."&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Thomas. ''Memoirs of the life of David Garrick'', New edition, 1780, I. x. 129, ''quoted'' in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these early pantomimes were re-tellings of a story from ancient Greek or Roman literature, with a break between the two acts during which the harlequinade's zany comic business was performed. The theatre historian David Mayer explains the use of the "batte" or slapstick and the [[transformation scene]] that led to the harlequinade:
{{quote|Rich gave his Harlequin the power to create stage magic in league with offstage craftsmen who operated trick scenery. Armed with a magic sword or bat (actually a slapstick), Rich's Harlequin treated his weapon as a wand, striking the scenery to sustain the illusion of changing the setting from one locale to another. Objects, too, were transformed by Harlequin's magic bat.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;|}}

[[File:Pantomime 1803.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Playbill of an English circus and pantomime performance, 1803]]
Pantomime gradually became more topical and comic, often involving spectacular and elaborate theatrical effects as far as possible. [[Colley Cibber]], [[David Garrick]] and others competed with Rich and produced their own pantomimes, and pantomime continued to grow in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, chapters 14 and 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1806–1836===
By the early 1800s, the pantomime's classical stories were often supplanted by stories adapted from European [[fairy tale]]s, [[fables]], [[Folklore|folk tales]], classic English literature or [[nursery rhyme]]s.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;&lt;ref name=OriginV&amp;A/&gt; Also, the [[harlequinade]] grew in importance until it often was the longest and most important part of the entertainment. Pantomimes usually had dual titles that gave an often humorous idea of both the pantomime story and the harlequinade. "Harlequin and ________", or "Harlequin _______; or, the ________".  In the second case, harlequin was used as an adjective, followed by words that described the pantomime "opening", for example: ''[[Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren|Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren; or, Fortunatus and the Water of Life, the Three Bears, the Three Gifts, the Three Wishes, and the Little Man who Woo'd the Little Maid]]''. Harlequin was the first word (or the first word after the "or") because Harlequin was initially the most important character. The titles continued to include the word Harlequin even after the first decade of the 1800s, when [[Joseph Grimaldi]] came to dominate London pantomime and made the character, Clown, a colourful agent of chaos, as important in the entertainment as Harlequin. At the same time, Harlequin began to be portrayed in a more romantic and stylised way.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 95–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grimaldi's performances elevated the role by "acute observation upon the foibles and absurdities of society, and his happy talent of holding them up to ridicule. He is the finest practical satyrist that ever existed. ... He was so extravagantly natural, that the most saturnine looker-on acknowledged his sway; and neither the wise, the proud, or the fair, the young nor the old, were ashamed to laugh till tears coursed down their cheeks at Joe and his comicalities."&lt;ref name=B16&gt;Broadbent, chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; Grimaldi's performances were important in expanding the importance of the harlequinade until it dominated the pantomime entertainment.&lt;ref name=grimaldi&gt;Moody, Jane. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/11630 "Grimaldi, Joseph (1778–1837)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008, accessed 21 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1800s, therefore, children went to the theatre around the Christmas and New Year holiday (and often at Easter or other times) primarily to witness the craziness of the harlequinade chase scene. It was the most exciting part of the "panto", because it was fast-paced and included spectacular scenic magic as well as [[slapstick]] comedy, dancing and acrobatics. The presence of slapstick in this part of the show evolved from the characters found in Italian commedia dell'arte.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt; The plot of the harlequinade was relatively simple; the star-crossed lovers, Harlequin and Columbine, run away from Columbine's foolish father, Pantaloon, who is being slowed down in his pursuit of them by his servant, Clown, and by a bumbling policeman. After the time of Grimaldi, Clown became the principal schemer trying to thwart the lovers, and Pantaloon was merely his assistant.&lt;ref name=grimaldi/&gt;

The opening "fairy story" was often blended with a story about a love triangle: a "cross-grained" old father who owns a business and whose pretty daughter is pursued by two suitors. The one she loves is poor but worthy, while the father prefers the other, a wealthy fop. Another character is a servant in the father's establishment. Just as the daughter is to be forcibly wed to the fop, or just as she was about to elope with her lover, the good fairy arrives.&lt;ref name=B16/&gt; This was followed by what was often the most spectacular part of the production, the magical transformation scene.&lt;ref name="Wilson, p"&gt;Wilson, p.?.&lt;/ref&gt; In early pantomimes, Harlequin possessed magical powers that he used to help himself and his love interest escape. He would tap his wooden sword (a derivative of the Commedia dell'arte slapstick or "batte") on the floor or scenery to make a grand transition of the world around him take place. The scene would switch from being inside some house or castle to, generally speaking, the streets of the town with storefronts as the backdrop. The transformation sequence was presided over by a Fairy Queen or [[Fairy Godmother]] character.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt; The good fairy magically transformed the leads from the opening fairy story into their new identities as the harlequinade characters. Following is an example of the speech that the fairy would give during this transformation:

&lt;poem&gt;Lovers stand forth. With you we shall begin.
You will be fair Columbine{{spaced ndash}}you Harlequin.
King Jamie there, the bonnie Scottish loon,
Will be a famous cheild for Pantaloon.
Though Guy Fawkes now is saved from rocks and axe,
I think he should pay the powder-tax.
His guyish plots blown up{{spaced ndash}}nay, do not frown;
You've always been a guy{{spaced ndash}}now be a Clown.&lt;ref name="Wilson, p"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

[[File:Dan Leno and Herbert Campbell.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Leno]] and [[Herbert Campbell]] in ''[[Babes in the Wood]]'', 1897, at the Drury Lane Theatre]]
This passage is from a pantomime adaptation of the [[Guy Fawkes]] story. The fairy creates the characters of the harlequinade in the most typical fashion of simply telling the characters what they will change into. The principal male and female characters from the beginning plotline, often both played by young women,&lt;ref name="East London Theatre Archive"/&gt; became the lovers Columbine and Harlequin, the mother or father of Columbine became Pantaloon, and the servant or other comic character became Clown. They would transition into the new characters as the scenery around them changed and would proceed in the "zany fun" section of the performance.&lt;ref name="Wilson, p"/&gt; From the time of Grimaldi, Clown would see the transformed setting and cry: "Here We Are Again!"&lt;ref name=grimaldi/&gt; The harlequinade began with various chase scenes, in which Harlequin and Columbine manage to escape from the clutches of Clown and Pantaloon, despite the acrobatic leaps of the former through windows, atop ladders, often because of well-meaning but misguided actions of the policeman. Eventually, there was a "dark scene", such as a cave or forest, in which the lovers were caught, and Harlequin's magic wand was seized from his grasp by Clown, who would flourish it in triumph. The good fairy would then reappear, and once the father agreed to the marriage of the young lovers, she would transport the whole company to a grand final scene.&lt;ref name=B16/&gt;

===1837 to the end of the harlequinade===
Despite its visible decline by 1836, the pantomime still fought to stay alive.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1843, when theatres other than the original patent theatres were permitted to perform spoken dialogue, the importance of the silent harlequinade began to decrease, while the importance of the fairy-tale part of the pantomime increased.&lt;ref name="OriginV&amp;A"&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/pantomime-origins/ "The Origin of Popular Pantomime Stories"], Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed January 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Two writers who helped to elevate the importance and popularity of the fairy-tale portion of the pantomime were [[James Planché]] and [[Henry James Byron]]. They emphasized puns and humorous word play, a tradition that continues in pantomime today.&lt;ref name="OriginV&amp;A"/&gt; As manager of Drury Lane in the 1870s, [[Augustus Harris]] wrote a series of extraordinarily popular pantomimes, focusing on the spectacle of the productions, that pushed this transition by emphasizing comic business in the pantomime opening and grand processionals.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, the harlequinade had become merely a brief epilogue to the pantomime, dwindling into a brief display of dancing and acrobatics.&lt;ref name=Crowther23&gt;Crowther, Andrew. "Clown and Harlequin", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', vol. 3, issue 23, Summer 2008, pp. 710–12.&lt;/ref&gt; It lingered for a few decades longer but finally disappeared, although a few of its comic elements had been incorporated into the pantomime stories.&lt;ref name=cox/&gt; The last harlequinade was played at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/development.html ''The Development of Pantomime''], Its-Behind-You.com, accessed 3 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern pantomime traditions and conventions==
Traditionally performed at [[Christmas]] and afterwards, with family audiences, British pantomime continues as a popular form of theatre, incorporating song, dance, buffoonery, [[slapstick]], [[cross-dressing]], in-jokes, topical references, audience participation, and mild [[sexual innuendo]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, David (2002). "British Culture: An Introduction", p. 74, Routledge; and [https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21636788-understand-britishand-have-fungo-and-see-christmas-pantomime-its-behind-you "It's Behind You"], ''The Economist'', 20 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional stories===
Pantomime story lines and scripts usually make no direct reference to Christmas, and are almost always based on traditional children's stories, particularly the [[fairy tales]] of [[Charles Perrault]], [[Joseph Jacobs]], [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and the [[Grimm Brothers]]. Some of the most popular pantomime stories include ''[[Cinderella]]'', ''[[Aladdin]]'', ''[[Dick Whittington and His Cat]]'' and ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'',&lt;ref name=HistoryIBY&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/Factsheets/The%20History%20of%20Pantomime.pdf "The History of Pantomime"], It's-Behind-You.com, 2002, accessed 10 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'', ''[[Peter Pan]]'', ''[[Puss in Boots]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bowie-Sell, Daisy. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/8064582/Top-ten-pantomimes-for-Christmas.html "Top ten pantomimes for Christmas"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 17 December 2010, accessed January 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Other traditional stories include ''[[Mother Goose]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Babes in the Wood]]'' (combined with elements of ''[[Robin Hood]]''), ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'', ''[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]'', ''[[Sinbad]]'', ''[[St. George and the Dragon]]'', ''[[Bluebeard]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[Thumbelina]]''.&lt;ref name=Chaffee278/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to about 1870, many other stories were made into pantomimes.&lt;ref name=OriginV&amp;A/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Richards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nL6lBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|title=The Golden Age of Pantomime: Slapstick, Spectacle and Subversion in Victorian England|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]]|page=27|year=2015|isbn=978-1-78076-293-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the familiarity of the audience with the original children's story is generally assumed, plot lines are almost always adapted for comic or satirical effect, and characters and situations from other stories are often interpolated into the plot. For instance "panto" versions of ''Aladdin'' may include elements from ''[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]'' or other ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tales; while ''Jack and the Beanstalk'' might include references to nursery rhymes and other children's stories involving characters called "Jack", such as ''[[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack and Jill]]''. Certain familiar scenes tend to recur, regardless of plot relevance, and [[Deus ex machina|highly unlikely resolution of the plot]] is common. Straight retellings of the original stories are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.limelightscripts.co.uk/origins-of-panto-stories/ | title = Origins of Panto Stories | publisher = Limelight scripts | accessdate = 2018-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance conventions===
The form has a number of conventions, some of which have changed or weakened a little over the years, and by no means all of which are obligatory. Some of these conventions were once common to other genres of popular theatre such as [[melodrama]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;
*The leading male juvenile character (the [[principal boy]]) is traditionally played by a young woman in male garments (such as [[breeches]]). Her romantic partner is usually the principal girl, a female [[ingénue]].
*An older woman (the [[pantomime dame]]{{spaced ndash}}often the hero's mother) is usually played by a man in [[travesti (theatre)|drag]].
*Risqué [[double entendre]], often wringing innuendo out of perfectly innocent phrases. This is, in theory, over the heads of the children in the audience and is for the entertainment of the adults.
*[[Audience participation]], including calls of "He's behind you!" (or "Look behind you!"), and "Oh, yes it is!" and "Oh, no it isn't!" The audience is always encouraged to hiss the villain and "awwwww" the poor victims, such as the rejected dame, who is usually enamoured with one of the male characters.
*Music may be original but is more likely to combine well-known tunes with [[parody music|re-written lyrics]]. At least one "audience participation" song is traditional: one half of the audience may be challenged to sing "their" chorus louder than the other half. Children in the audience may even be invited on stage to sing along with members of the cast.
*The animal, played by an actor in "animal skin" or animal costume. It is often a [[pantomime horse]] or cow (though could even be a camel if appropriate to the setting), played by two actors in a single costume, one as the head and front legs, the other as the body and back legs.
*The good fairy enters from stage right (from the audience's point of view this is on the left) and the villain enters from stage left (right from the point of view of the audience). This convention goes back to the medieval mystery plays, where the right side of the stage symbolised Heaven and the left side symbolised Hell.
*A slapstick comedy routine may be performed, often a decorating or baking scene, with humour based on throwing messy substances. Until the 20th century, British pantomimes often concluded with a [[harlequinade]], a free-standing entertainment of [[slapstick]]. Nowadays the slapstick is more or less incorporated into the main body of the show.
*In the 19th century, until the 1880s, pantomimes typically included a transformation scene in which a Fairy Queen magically transformed the pantomime characters into the characters of the harlequinade, who then performed the harlequinade.&lt;ref name=Crowther23/&gt;
*The Chorus, who can be considered [[Extra (actor)|extras]] on-stage, and often appear in multiple scenes (but as different characters) and who perform a variety of songs and dances throughout the show. Because of their multiple roles, they may have as much stage-time as the lead characters themselves.
*At some point during the performance, characters including the Dame and the comic will sit on a bench and sing a cheerful song to forget their fears. The thing they fear appears behind them, but at first the characters ignore the audience's warnings of danger. The characters soon circle the bench, followed by the ghost, as the audience cries "It's behind you!"  One by one, the characters see the ghost and run off, until at last the Dame and the ghost come face to face, whereupon the ghost, frightened by the visage of the Dame, runs away.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Millie. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sScff8kwJzYC&amp;pg=PA130 "Audience Participation, Community and Ritual"], ''British Pantomime Performance'', p. 130, Intellect Books, 2007. {{ISBN|1841501743}}.  Another bench scene is described in the same source at pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guest celebrities===
Another contemporary pantomime tradition is the celebrity guest star, a practice that dates back to the late 19th century, when [[Augustus Harris]], proprietor of the [[Drury Lane|Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], hired well-known variety artists for his pantomimes.

Many modern pantomimes use popular artists to promote the pantomime, and the play is often adapted to allow the star to showcase their well-known act, even when such a spot has little relation to the plot. As critic [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] has explained, if the star enters into the spirit of the entertainment, he or she can add to its overall effect, while if it becomes a "showcase for a star" who "stands outside the action", the celebrity's presence can detract, notwithstanding the marketing advantage that the star brings to the piece.&lt;ref name=Nifty&gt;Billington, Michael. [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/dec/20/theatre.shopping1 "''Aladdin'': Old Vic, London"], ''The Guardian'', 20 December 2004. Retrieved 26 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Billington said that [[Ian McKellen]] in a 2004 ''Aladdin'' "lets down his hair and lifts up his skirt to reveal a nifty pair of legs and an appetite for ''double entendre'': when told by decorators that 'your front porch could do with a good lick', McKellen adopts a suitable look of mock-outrage. ... At least we can tell our grandchildren that we saw McKellen's Twankey and it was huge."&lt;ref name=Nifty/&gt;

===United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland===
Many theatres in cities and towns throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland continue to have an annual professional pantomime. Pantomime is also very popular with [[amateur theatre|amateur dramatics]] societies throughout the UK and Ireland, and the pantomime season (roughly speaking, late November to February) will see pantomime productions in many village halls and similar venues across the country.

===Australia===
Pantomimes in Australia at Christmas were once very popular, but the genre has declined greatly since the middle of the 20th century. Several later professional productions did not recover their costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Blake | first = Elissa | title = British pantomime ready to take Sydney by storm|newspaper = Sydney Morning Herald | date = 24 June 2014 | url = https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/british-pantomime-ready-to-take-sydney-by-storm-20140625-zskg6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christmas pantomimes are performed yearly at the [[Hudson, Quebec|Hudson]] Village Theatre in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinderella|url=http://www.villagetheatre.ca/Show/157.aspx|accessdate=29 December 2013|archivedate=29 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222014144/http://www.villagetheatre.ca/Show/157.aspx|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1996, [[Ross Petty]] Productions has staged pantomimes at Toronto's [[Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres|Elgin Theatre]] each Christmas season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Flowers, Ellen|author2=Pim, Gordon|url=http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/user_assets/documents/HM-Sep-2013-ENG.pdf|title=Ontario’s theatrical heritage in the spotlight|work=Heritage Matters|publisher=[[Ontario Heritage Trust]]|volume=11|issue=3|date=September 2013|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pantomimes imported from England were produced at the [[Royal Alexandra Theatre]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=b5a16d2d-0ebe-4279-8848-a13eabf03447&amp;p=2 "Mum's not the word with theatre genie's pantomimes"], ''National Post'', accessed 24 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/gallery512.html "''Goldilocks and the Three Bears''], [[Royal Alexandra Theatre]], Toronto"], Its-behind-you.com, accessed 24 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The White Rock Players Club in White Rock, BC have presented an annual pantomime in the Christmas season since 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiterockplayers.ca/about-us/club-history/past-productions-2/ ''Past Productions"], White Rock Players' Club, retrieved 26 April 2018..&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Canadian Theatre Company produces pantomimes in British Columbia, written by Ellie King.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra, Kristi.

===Malta===
Pantomime was imported{{when|date=May 2018}} for a British expatriate audience and later adapted by Maltese producers for Maltese audiences. While in many former territories of the British empire, pantomime declined in popularity after independence, as it was seen as a symbol of colonial rule, studies have shown that this genre remains strong in Malta.&lt;ref&gt;Spiteri, Stephanie.

===Jamaica===
The National Pantomime of Jamaica was started in 1941 by educators [[Henry Fowler (educator)|Henry Fowler]] and Greta Fowler, pioneers of the [[Little Theatre Movement]] in Jamaica. Among the first players was [[Louise Bennett-Coverley]]. Other notable players have included [[Oliver Samuels]], [[Charles Hyatt]], [[Willard White]], [[Rita Marley]] and [[Dawn Penn]]. The annual pantomime opens on [[Boxing Day]] at the Little Theatre in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] and is strongly influenced by aspects of Jamaican culture, folklore and history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltmpantomime.com/pages/pantohist.html "History"], Little Theatre Movement, 2004, accessed 24 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heap, Brian.

Pantomime has seldom been performed in the United States, although a few productions have been mounted in recent years. As a consequence, Americans commonly understand the word "pantomime" to refer to the art of mime as it was practised, for example, by [[Marcel Marceau]] and [[Nola Rae]]. However, certain shows that came from the pantomime traditions, especially ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]'', are performed quite often, and a few American theatre companies produce traditional British-style pantomime as well as American adaptations of the form.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

According to Professor Russell A. Peck of the [[University of Rochester]], the earliest pantomime productions in the US were ''Cinderella'' pantomime productions in New York in March 1808, New York again in August 1808, Philadelphia in 1824, and Baltimore in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Russell A.

==Plot summary==
Set four years before the events described in ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'', the novel takes place in an [[alternate universe (fan fiction)|alternate universe]] version of [[Regency era]] England where zombies are a well-known menace spawned by an event known as The Troubles.

After attending a funeral in which a zombie rises from his coffin, Mr. Bennet decides that he must finally keep an old promise to train his five daughters in the art of zombie-killing. To this end, he turns the family's greenhouse into a [[dojo]] and hires young martial-arts expert Master Hawksworth to teach the girls. Meanwhile, a scientist named Dr. Keckilpenny arrives in the area with the dream of studying and possibly domesticating the zombies. As the zombie plague continues to spread across England, Hawksworth and Keckilpenny compete for Elizabeth's affections while Mrs. Bennet plots to find suitably wealthy suitors for both Elizabeth and her older sister Jane. In a bid to get reinforcements against the plague, Jane becomes the bodyguard of Lord Lumpley, a fat, lazy nobleman with low moral standards. Meanwhile, Elizabeth and Keckilpenny capture a zombie for further research.

==Reception==
''[[Booklist]]'' gave the novel a favorable review, calling it "a must-read for the growing legion of alternate-Austen fans (including, naturally, everyone who has read ''[[Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]]'')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author=Moyer, Jessica |title= Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the Dreadfuls|url=http://www.booklistonline.com/default.aspx?page=show_product&amp;pid=4058903/ |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate= 2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the novel a grade of "B-," stating that the novel "often succeeds on its own terms" while noting that author Hockensmith "makes no attempt at Jane Austen’s style, either for replication or parody," and that the story is "nothing more or less than an adventure story that happens to be set in Regency England."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author=Bowman, Donna |title= Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the Dreadfuls|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/steve-hockensmith-pride-and-prejudice-and-zombies,39731/ |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate= 2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Itbox.jpg|thumb|The [[itbox]] is a platform widely used for SWP games in the United Kingdom]] --&gt;
A '''skill with prize''' or '''skill with prizes''' (SWP) machine is a gaming machine which provides a payout (the prize) and whose outcome depends in part on the player's skill (the skill). They are contrasted with [[amusement with prize]] machines which, while interactive, do not depend on the player's skill in determining outcome.

SWP machines are a hybrid of [[games of skill]] and [[games of chance]]; the degree to which skill versus chance determines the outcome varies between machines, and may be set by operator parameters.

== Examples ==
[[Stacker (game)|Stacker]] is a common free-standing [[merchandiser]] SWP machine.
In the [[United Kingdom]], the most common class of SWP machines are [[quiz machine]]s, on such platforms as the [[itbox]], and are widely found in [[public houses]]. Indeed, "quiz machine" is often used interchangeably with "SWP" for such counter-top machines, though not all games on these devices are quiz-based: other games include ''Crystal Maze,'' based on [[The Crystal Maze]], and [[Word Up (video game)|Word Up]].

[[File:Snorkelling with the swollen purple head.JPG|thumb|[[Claw crane]]s, often containing [[plush toy]]s, are a common type of merchandiser.]]
Another class of SWP machines are free-standing machines, generally found in [[video arcade]]s. These are frequently [[merchandiser]]s – devices containing prizes – most commonly [[claw crane]]s, and more recently [[Stacker (game)|Stacker]]. Other examples include Barber Cut and Barber Cut Lite by [[Namco Bandai Games]].&lt;ref name="bcl"&gt;[http://www.namcoamerica.com/game.php?gameid=18 Namco Arcade - Game - Barber Cut Lite]&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also a number of SWP games specific to Japan, such as ''Move Sector'' and ''Ring Magician''.  Another class are [[redemption game]]s, which rather than containing prizes, instead dispense tickets which can be redeemed for prizes. Some machines, such as [[Flamin' Finger]] and Stacker, can be configured as either merchandisers or redemption games.

== Economics ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
SWP machines are generally intended to be profitable for the operator in their own right, rather than as loss leaders; sample economics are given in reference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namcoamerica.com/news.php?articleid=51 Barber Cut Lite: Simply Slicing Through the Competition]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Barber Cut'' is advertised as "more addicting than any other prize redemption game, and those repeat-plays will land right in your cash box!"&lt;ref name="bcl" /&gt;

A problem that some vendors identify is that players may be "''skeptical of any chance at winning''",&lt;ref name="bcl" /&gt; since many SWP games can be and are rigged to only provide payout a fraction of the time;&lt;ref&gt;See details of rigging at [[claw crane]]s, together with regulations in various jurisdictions.&lt;/ref&gt;
thus evidence that suggests that a prize has been won "convinces players that it is actually possible to win."&lt;ref name="bcl" /&gt;

While SWP machines are generally not intended to be winnable by skilled players – otherwise such a player could continue to play and win and causes losses to the operator – it is sometimes possible that player skill, or using the machine in a way not anticipated by the manufacturer, can result in the game becoming winnable. This may result in service updates by the manufacturer to close the exploit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namcoamerica.com/news.php?articleid=59 Barber Cut Lite Service Update Notice]&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods to minimize losses are discussed at [[claw crane]]s.

== Regulation ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
SWP machines are in a legal gray area in the United States, due to containing elements of skill and of chance, particularly since payout percentages can to a large extent be set by the operator – such setting leads to machines being described as rigged. They are generally regulated separately from games of pure chance such as [[slot machine]]s; see [[Claw vending machine#Legality|claw vending machine: legality]] for statutes pertaining to claw machines. (They are legal and regulated in the United Kingdom, for example).

Claims of being largely or entirely skill-based can expose the operator to accusation of [[Unfair business practices|unfair practices]]; thus some lawyers advise operators to not advertise the machines as being skill-based.&lt;ref name='lawsuits'&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aemllc.com/articles/legislative/skillcraneoperators/skillcraneoperators.php | title=Skill Crane Operators Can Defend Against ‘Unfair Practices’ Lawsuits | author=Bob Snyder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 1st 2010, all UK SWP machines must adhere to strict guidelines set down by BACTA (British Amusement &amp; Catering Trade Association) &amp; the gambling commission. These guidelines state that there must be no element of chance within the game that can affect the outcome. There are also limits set on the level of skill needed to play, for example there must be a minimum amount of time for a player to react to the game. This ensures that manufacturers &amp; operators cannot be accused of setting physically impossible skill levels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27743">'''Stage combat''' or '''fight choreography''' is a specialised technique in [[theatre]] designed to create the [[illusion]] of physical [[combat]] without causing harm to the performers. It is employed in live [[stage plays]] as well as [[operatic]] and [[ballet]] productions. With the advent of cinema and television the term has widened to also include the [[choreography]] of [[film]]ed fighting sequences, as opposed to the earlier live performances on stage. It is closely related to the practice of [[stunts]] and is a common field of study for [[actor]]s. Actors famous for their stage fighting skills frequently have backgrounds in [[dance]] or [[martial art]]s training.

==History==
===Ancient history===
The history of stage fighting and mock combat can be traced to antiquity, with [[Aristotle]] quoted as noting that tragedy is conflict between people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poetics|last=Aristotle|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Chpt. 6, Sect. II. Line 16-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or indeed it may be traced to the [[origins of the human species]] and [[primate]] [[display behaviour]]. Display of martial aptitude is a natural occurrence in [[warrior|warrior societies]], and ritualized forms of mock combat often evolve into [[war dance]]s. Whether it is the struggle between the men and women of [[Aristophanes]]' [[Lysistrata]] in Ancient Greece or Ancient Egypt where [[Herodotus]] in his [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] talks about a religious festival in which they beat each other with staves but no one dies, staged combat has always existed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Histories|last=Herodotus|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Book II|location=|pages=Line 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As it doesn't make sense to sacrifice citizens in rituals, many ancient civilizations turned to symbolic gestures of combat through dancing or bringing a weapon to someone's throat or neck without actually touching them to symbolize death or an act of violence.

===Post-classical history===
Fights staged for entertainment may also be in earnest for the combatants, as was the case with the Roman [[gladiator]]s, and any public [[duel]], such as the [[judicial duel]] of the [[European Middle Ages]]. The [[medieval tournament]] and [[jousting|joust]] are a classical examples of competitive ritualised mock combat. The joust from the time of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] developed into a [[sport]] with enormous cost involved for each knight and correspondingly high prestige attached, comparable to contemporary [[Formula One]] races, while at the same time minimizing the danger of injury with highly specialized equipment.

In the [[Late Middle Ages]], staged fencing bouts, with or without choreography, became popular with [[fencing schools]]. Some German [[fechtbuch]] ("combat manuals", literally 'fight' or 'fence book') have sections dedicated to flamboyant techniques to be employed in such ''Klopffechten'' ("knockabout fighting"), which would be impractical in serious combat, and the Late Medieval German masters distinguish mock fights (''fechten zu schimpf'', 'rant fighting') and real combat (''fechten zu ernst'', 'earnest fighting').

The history of European theatrical combat has its roots in [[medieval theatre]], and becomes tangible in [[Elizabethan drama]]. [[Richard Tarlton|Richard Tarleton]], who was a member of both William [[Shakespeare]]'s acting company and of the London Masters of Defence weapons guild, was among the first fight directors in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stage Fights|last=Gordon|first=Gilbert|publisher=Theatre Art Books|year=1973|isbn=0-87830-131-3|location=New York|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sword duels depicted in plays showed how popular the pastime was in actual life. Before 1615 in England, many plays featured duels and the duels were regarded as highlights of the show. As opposed to after 1615, when dueling was publicly condemned by [[James VI and I|King James]] and the duels were used as a last resort in regards to the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waggoner|first=G. R.|date=1965|title=Timon of Athens and the Jacobean Duel|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2867659|journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|volume=16|pages=304-306|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern History===
During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, stylized stage combat has been a staple feature of traditional performing arts for centuries, such as in Japanese ''[[Kabuki]]'' theater (as ''tachimawari'' "fighting scenes"), Chinese [[Beijing Opera]] and Indian theater.

[[fencing (sport)|Fencing]] masters in Europe began to research and experiment with [[historical fencing]] techniques, with weapons such as the [[two-handed sword]], [[rapier]] and [[smallsword]], and to instruct actors in their use. Notable amongst these were George Dubois, a Parisian fight director and martial artist who created performance fencing styles based on [[gladiator]]ial combat as well as Renaissance [[rapier and dagger]] fencing. [[Egerton Castle]] and Captain [[Alfred Hutton]] of London were also involved both in reviving antique fencing systems and in teaching these styles to actors.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Tony.

[[File:Gounod - Faust, act IV - Duel scene - The Victrola book of the opera.jpg|thumb|The beginning of a staged duel from Act IV of Gounod's ''Faust.'' ]]
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scenes of swordplay in touring theatrical productions throughout Europe, the British Commonwealth and the USA were typically created by combining several widely known, generic routines known as "standard combats", identified by names such as the "Round Eights" and the "Glasgow Tens".

[[Cinematic fencing]] has its roots in the 1920s, with the movies of [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. One of the more celebrated fight directors who emerged in this time was [[Paddy Crean]] who revolutionized stage combat, specifically sword play, for the silver screen and theater. Paddy created the flamboyant style of sword play that can be seen in [[Errol Flynn filmography|Errol Flynn movies]], among others. He promoted the use of safety above all things and then focused on story of the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Feryn|first=Elisabeth|title=The Fight Master: A Documentary about Paddy Crean|date=2008-03-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mW6P8bZADk&amp;t=330s|volume=|pages=|access-date=2018-11-17|last2=Walker-Fitzpatrick|first2=Lesley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[B. H. Barry]] and J. Allen Suddeth, students of Paddy Crean, are two fight masters who have continued developing Paddy's legacy. Barry helped found the Society of British Fight Directors and then came to the United States to give fight direction a more specific shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.primarystagesoffcenter.org/interviews/a-e/b.h.-barry|title=B.H.

Informal guilds of fight choreographers began to take shape in the 1970s with the establishment of The Society of British Fight Directors, 1969 to 1996. Training was established in the United States with the formation of the [https://www.safd.org/ Society of American Fight Directors] in 1977.

Following this, further academies and associations worldwide have been established to uphold the craft, training and quality of work in the art-form of stage combat nationally and internationally, including: The [[British Academy Of Stage &amp; Screen Combat (BASSC)]] and [http://www.fdc.ca/ Fight Directors Canada (FDC)] in 1993; the [https://safdi.org.au/ Society of Australian Fight Directors Inc. (SAFDi)] in 1994; the [http://nordicstagefight.com/ Nordic Stage Fight Society (NSFS)] and the New Zealand Stage Combat Society in 1995; the British Academy of Dramatic Combat (BADC) in 1996; [http://www.artofcombat.org/ Art of Combat] in 1997; [http://www.stage-combat.de/ Stage Combat Deutschland] in 2004; and the [https://www.australianstagecombat.org.au/ Australian Stage Combat Association (ASCA)] in 2010; [http://thebritishguildofstagecombat.blogspot.com/ The British Guild of Stage Combat] in 2015. As of 2005, [[East 15 Acting School]], [[London]] offered a [[B.A. (Hons)]] Degree in ''Acting &amp; Stage Combat.'' Many of the societies offer certification programs for different weapons, which is used as an indicator about how much training an actor has had.

==Techniques==
[[File:Sword parts no scabbard.PNG|alt=Diagram of a sword and it's parts.|thumb|The parts of a sword.]]
Stage combat training includes unarmed combat skills such as illusory slaps, punches, kicks, throwing and holding techniques;  theatrical adaptations of various forms of [[historical fencing|fencing]] such as [[rapier]] and [[dagger]], [[smallsword]] and [[broadsword]], as well as the use of other weapons, notably the [[quarterstaff]] and [[knives]]; and more specialized skills such as [[professional wrestling]] and different styles of [[martial arts]]. However, stage combat can include any form of choreographed violence and the options are limited only by safety concerns, and the ability of the participants involved. As a note, most of these techniques are drawn from actual fighting techniques, but modified to be safer for actors. For example, although there are a number of ways of creating the safe illusion of a slap to the face (which is obviously something that could really be done in combat), none of these involve making actual contact with the victim's face.

The over-riding concern is for the safety of the actors and audience. This requirement has led to the adaptation of many standard martial arts and fencing skills specifically for performance. For example, many basic sword attacks and parries must be modified to ensure that the actors do not bring the points of their weapons past their partner's face or otherwise inadvertently risk the other actor's health and well-being. Attacking actions in stage combat are extended past the performance partner's body, or aimed short of their apparent targets. Likewise, whereas their characters may be trying to violently twist each other's limbs, slap, or punch, or grapple, and engaging in vicious unarmed combat, the actors must operate at a high level of complicity and communication to ensure a safe, exciting fight scene. In many forms of stage combat, distance is a key factor in technique. Many attacks are performed 'out of distance' so that there is no possible chance of one performer accidentally striking the other. Considerable professional judgement is called upon to determine what technical level may be appropriate for a given performer, taking into account allotted rehearsal time, and the expectations of the director.

Another important element of stage combat is sound. Sound increases the believability of an action for the audience. There are two kinds of sounds that can be made. One is vocal reactions. By adding a gasp, groan, or grunt when struck, the combatants make the moves come to life. The other kind of sound is a knap or a percussive sound made by hitting a resonant part of the body.&lt;ref&gt;The Society of American Fight Directors. ''Glossary of Terms''. Updated 3/19/16. http://www.safd.org.&lt;/ref&gt; This is timed to the moment an impact would happen and is staged so it is hidden from the audience. This allows the audience to believe that an actual blow or slap has landed because they hear a corresponding sound and see a reaction. 

The combat phase of a play [[rehearsal]] is referred to as a ''fight rehearsal''. Choreography is typically learned step by step, and practiced at first very slowly before increasing to a speed that is both dramatically convincing and safe for the performers and their audience. Even stage combat is risky, and it is preferable for actors to have as much [[training]] and [[experience]] as possible. A "fight call" or a brief rehearsal before the show is performed each time, set aside for the actors to "mark" through the fight to increase their [[muscle memory]]. A show which involves fight choreography will typically be trained and supervised by a professional fight choreographer and may also include a ''fight captain'', who runs fight calls and ensures that actors are remaining safe throughout the duration of the show. 

The fighting styles in movies set in the Medieval or Renaissance period may be unrealistic and historically inaccurate. Most fight choreographers use a mix between Asian martial arts and sports fencing to re-enact fight scenes. This generally due to the look of the fighting asked for by the director. If the director wants the story to flow a certain way, then the fight director will choreograph the fights to fit that style and tell the story.

== Types of weapons used in stage combat ==
For stage combat, all edges should be dulled and points blunted so that there is no risk of severe injury if someone is accidentally stabbed. In addition, weapons that are used, and not just for show, should be certified as combat-ready, thereby preventing any accidents involving blades accidentally breaking off.
[[File:Quarterstaff line drawing - Project Gutenberg eText 14315.jpg|thumb|Quarterstaff fight]]

=== Quarterstaff ===
Used in shows that are performed in large playing spaces due to the large size of the weapon. Most popular [[quarterstaff]] fight is that between Robin Hood and Little John in the tale of [[Robin Hood]] from the 17th century ballad. Modern quarterstaff choreography has also integrated the techniques of the [[Bō|bō staff]] from the Japanese martial art [[Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū]] which originated around 1447. Examples of this style can be seen in the famous [[Kabuki]] play ''[[Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura]]'' written in 1748.

=== Broadsword ===
[[File:Rapier MET sfeah29.16.10 004.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Rapier sword.]]
A large sword commonly used in the early [[Middle Ages]] in Europe. The [[broadsword]] was notable for its large hilt which allowed it to be wielded with both hands due to its size and weight. Used for slashing rather than stabbing, this weapon is used in plays set in this period like Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]'' and is also seen in fantasy epics like ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]''.

=== Rapier ===
First school instructing on the correct use of the [[rapier]] in England was started in 1576 by Rocco Bonetti from Italy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weapons in the theatre|last=Wise|first=Arthur|publisher=Barnes and Noble|year=1968|isbn=|location=New York|pages=5, 123-124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonetti took over the lease from playwright [[John Lyly]] to open his school in [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Methods and Practice of Elizabethan Swordplay|last=Turner|first=Craig|last2=Soper|first2=Tony|publisher=Southern University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=Carbondale, IL|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapier has the advantage of the thrust over the slash which means it could be a much smaller and lighter weapon than the broadsword. It is popular in Shakespeare plays like ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]'' where duels are performed and can be used in combination with a dagger.
[[File:The art of fencing, or, the use of the small sword Fleuron T123392-15.png|thumb|Two men dueling using the smallsword.]]

=== Smallsword ===
The [[Small sword|smallsword]] came into fashion in England and France in the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was used as a thrusting weapon and so sword movements were kept minimal to find the opening that a thrust could land. Most men of the period carried smallswords as fashion accessories so most were elegantly ornamented. An example of a smallsword duel can be seen in ''[[Les Liaisons Dangereuses (Hampton play)|Les Liaisons Dangereuses]]'' by [[Christopher Hampton]] written in 1985, based on the 1782 [[Les Liaisons dangereuses|novel of the same name]].
[[File:Knife fighting practice. Training session led by Dmitry Dyomushkin – Photo 002.jpg|thumb|Two opponents face off in a knife fighting rehearsal.]]

=== Knife ===
There are many styles of knives from the [[Bowie knife]] to a [[switchblade]]. [[Knife fight|Knife fights]] tend to have quick sharp movements. A example of this can be seen in ''[[West Side Story]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s fight between Riff and Bernardo. Often in plays however, it is one actor with a knife against someone who is unarmed like in Act I of [[Georges Bizet]]'s opera ''[[Carmen]],'' written in 1875.

[[File:Arbo-Valkyrien 1864.jpg|thumb|Approximate size and shape of shield used in stage combat.]]

=== Sword and shield ===
The [[Shield|shields]] used in stage combat are commonly round and are strong enough that they can be used as a defensive and offensive weapon. An important element in using a shield is to hold the shield arm in an upper diagonal so the fist is higher than the elbow so the top of the shield does not move when struck, and the danger being hit in the face with the shield or the weapon using to strike it can be avoided. Sword and shields can be found in battle scenes like in Shakespeare's [[Wars of the Roses]] history plays.

=== Unarmed ===
This consists of hand to hand combat without weapon. Elements of unarmed combat include slaps, punches, kicks, grabs, chokes, falls, rolls, grappling, among others. Many fight directors rely on combinations of messy street fighting and martial arts such as [[aikido]] and [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] to create fights of this nature. Generally more common in modern contemporary plays, after swords have gone out of style but also seen in older plays such as Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' when Othello strangles Desdemona.

=== Found Objects ===
Found objects are objects that are not traditionally weapons but can be used so in the context of the scene. A classic example of this is breaking a bottle over someone's head. As with all stage combat, the objects are rigged so as not to actually pose any danger to the recipients. In the case of bottles or plates, [[sugar glass]] molds are used rather than actual glass bottles.
[[File:Katana moderne.JPG|thumb|Example of a katana.]]

=== Japanese weapons ===
Other weapons like a [[katana]], a Japanese style sword that is curved on one side, and [[Nunchaku|nunchuks]] can also be used onstage. These require more detailed study of Japanese martial arts. Stage combat versions of nunchuks can be purchased that are foam instead of wood, thereby reducing the danger to the actors.
[[File:Battle-axe (PSF).png|thumb|Example of a battle axe.]]

=== Melee weapons ===
[[Melee weapon|Melee weapons]] are used in large battle scenes and can include [[Spear|spears]], [[Axe|axes]], [[Mace (bludgeon)|maces]], [[Flail (weapon)|flails]], and more. These are other weapons that are best used in large playing spaces where there is room to work at a safe distance.

==Realism in fight choreography==
Fight choreography can vary widely from true [[Realism (arts)|realism]] to outright [[fantasy]] depending upon the requirements of a particular production. One of the biggest reasons that theatrical fight directors often do not aim for strict realism is that the live audience could not easily follow the 'story' of the action if bodies and blades were moving in the ways trained fighters would move them. For example, a production of [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)]], by [[Edmond Rostand]], using 17th-Century rapiers, might show Cyrano making lots of circular cut attacks. But a more efficient, practical attack would be taking a quicker, more direct line to the opponent's body. But the fight director knows that the audience couldn't follow the action as well if the attacks were faster (the audience might hardly be able to see the thin blades whip through the air), so most fight choreographers would make choices to help the audience follow the story. Of course, this is dependent on the production, the director and other stylistic choices.

One school of fight choreographer thought says that an unusual aspect of live stage combat, such as in a play, is that audiences will react negatively to even simulated violence if they fear the actors are being harmed: for example, if an actor is really slapped in the face, the audience will stop thinking about the character and, instead, worry about the performer. Audiences may also fear for their own safety if large combat scenes seem to be out of control. Therefore, stage combat is not simply a safety technique but is also important for an audience to maintain uninterrupted [[suspension of disbelief]].

==Types of choreographed fights==

===In theater===
Having its roots in [[Medieval theatre]], stage combat enters classical theatre choreography with [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan drama]] ([[Shakespeare]]'s simple and oft seen stage direction, ''they fight'').

===On film===
{{main|Combat in film}}
[[File:The three musketeers fairbanks.jpg|thumb|Movie poster for [[The Three Musketeers (1921 film)|''The Three Musketeers'']] (1921) starring Douglas Fairbanks.]]

Cinema inherited the concept of choreographed fights directly from the theatrical fight. [[Douglas Fairbanks]] in 1920 was the first film director to ask a fencing master to assist the production of a fencing scene in cinema.&lt;ref&gt;2007 Britannica, s.v. fencing.&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave of swashbuckling films was triggered with [[Errol Flynn]] from 1935. Renewed interest in swashbuckling films arose in the 1970s, in  the wake of
''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' (1973). Directors at this stage aimed for a certain amount of historical accuracy, although, as the 2007 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] puts it, "movie fencing remains a poor representation of actual fencing technique".
The ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, the fights for which are choreographed by [[Bob Anderson (fencer)|Bob Anderson]] &amp; Peter Diamond (Episodes IV, V &amp; VI) and Nick Gillard (Episodes I, II &amp; III), tend to portray its [[lightsaber combat]] using swordsmanship techniques drawn from existing martial arts, but performed with fantasy weapons such as [[lightsaber]]s or [[the Force]], whereas the action featured in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' also choreographed by Bob Anderson employed fantasy weapons and fighting styles, designed by [[Wolf System stage combat training|Tony Wolf]].

During the 1970s and 1980s, [[Sonny Chiba]], [[Bruce Lee]] and [[Jackie Chan]], who are famous for both choreographing and acting in martial arts action films, were influential in the development of stage combat on film. [[Hong Kong]]-based fight choreographer [[Yuen Woo-ping]] is known for his work on ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' and [[The Matrix series|the ''Matrix'' trilogy]], in which the often unrealistic fighting techniques are complemented by directorial techniques such as [[bullet time]]. [[Ching Siu-tung]] is particularly noted in the field of [[Hong Kong action cinema]] for his use of graceful [[wire fu]] techniques. By contrast, films such as ''[[The Duellists]]'', fight directed by William Hobbs, ''[[Once Were Warriors (film)|Once Were Warriors]]'', fight directed by Robert Bruce and ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' &amp;  [[Ironclad (film)|Ironclad]], fight directed by Richard Ryan are widely famed for including gritty, realistic combat scenes. Ryan is also known for his creativity in devising styles such as Batman's in ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', Sherlock Holmes 'prevision' style in Guy Ritchie's two ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' movies.

===Combat reenactment===
{{main|Combat reenactment|Historical martial arts reconstruction}}

'''Combat reenactment''' is a side of [[historical reenactment]] which aims to depict events of battle, normally a specific engagement in history, but also unscripted battles where the 'winner' is not predetermined.

[[File:Държавен куклен театър Варна.jpg|thumb|right]]

The '''State Puppet Theatre - Varna''' was founded in 1952 in the resort of [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]]. More than 250 productions have been put on its stage, more than 20 0000 performances have been played, seen by more than 8 million spectators in total.

The theatre has its own building in the centre of the town, containing an auditorium with 200 seats, a rehearsal stage, dressing rooms, administration rooms, studios and a Museum of [[Puppet]]s - the only one of that kind on the [[Balkans]].

The repertoire of the theatre offers performances for spectators of all age, starting from classical and modern plays for children, entertaining and vanguard performances for adults to educational productions for students.

Varna Puppet Theatre has been the host of the prestigious International Puppet Festival The Golden Dolphin. It is held every three years at the beginning of October in the town of Varna and it has turned into a centre of the best achievements of puppet theatres in the world.

==Founding==

The [[puppeteer]], [[stage designer]] and [[Theatre director|director]] '''Georgi Saravanov''' (1920–2000) was the founder, manager, director and stage designer of Varna Puppet Theatre from 1952 to 1958. Before that, had founded the marionette theatre in [[Plovdiv]] in 1948.

In 1951, the community of Varna invited Georgi Saravanov to establish a puppet theatre in Varna. He established a group of novice actors, some of whom had graduated from a musical school. In August 1952, the puppet show The Duckling by Nina Gernett and Tamara Gurevich was played in the old hall of the Varna Commune theatre with marionettes that Saravanov made by himself. His unique puppets from the first performances may be seen at the Museum of Puppets at the theatre.

The other founders included: Yordanka Saravanova, Petya Mandadzhiyska, Olga Peneva, Ruska Tsekova, Stefan Krumov, Avgustina Boeva, Anton Kutikov, Boris Zhelev, Vyara Mihaylova-Popova, Veselin Dionisiev, Dimitar Popov, Konstantin Kotsev, Nedka Pinteva, Neli Dzhedzheva-Mihova, Nastya Mihaylova, Roza Bozadzhieva, Stefan Voykov, Dimitar Bogdanov, etc.

==The theatre==

A building was allocated to be converted into a new theatre for the company; this was situated at Vladislav Varnenchik boulevard, behind the Post Station. There were soup kitchens and a cereals warehouse there, but despite having almost no money, the first puppeteers worked to transform it into a theatre.  The first premiere in the new hall was The Golden Fish, after [[Alexander Pushkin]], in late December 1953.

In Varna Saravanov staged the performances: The Duckling, The Two Bears, The Golden Fish, Cinderella, The Dragon and the Golden Apple, The Devil's Mill, The Scarlet Flower, Aladdin's Magic Lamp, The Pearl Tears Girl, Life-giving Water and Ivan - the Peasant Son, Darling Beauty, etc. Some of these shows came from Bulgarian and Russian fairy-tales, others from other parts of the world. His preference for the marionettes with the highest degree required an exceptional puppeteering technique from the actors. This circumstance contributed to further achievement of notable puppeteering mastery by the actors' team of Varna.

Five years after its construction, first international event for the theatre - participation in the World Puppet Art Festival in [[Bucharest]], Romania in May 1958.

On 12 July 1985, the theatre moved to a new building in the city centre. Professor Nikolina Georgieva's performance Carnival of Animals was played at the official inauguration.

The '''University Rover Challenge''' (URC) by the [[Mars Society]] is a robotics competition for university level students that challenges teams to design and build a rover that would be of use to early explorers on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://urc.marssociety.org/home | title=University Rover Challenge | publisher=marssociety.org | accessdate=Aug 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The competition is held annually at the [[Mars Desert Research Station]], outside [[Hanksville, Utah]] in the United States. The site was selected by the Mars Society for its geographic similarity to Mars: In addition to being a largely barren desert area, the soil in the area has a chemical composition similar to Martian soil. The competition has also expanded internationally to include the [[European Rover Challenge]], [https://circ.cstag.ca/ Canadian International Rover Challenge], and the [http://www.indianroverchallenge.com/ Indian Rover Challenge] as part of the Rover Challenge Series.

[[File:Mars_Society_University_Rover_Challenge_2017.jpg|thumb|Group photo from 2017 Mars Society University Rover Challenge at the Mars Desert Research Station near Hanksville, Utah.]]The aim of the University Rover Challenge is to encourage students to develop skills in robotics, improve the state-of-the-art in rovers, and work in multi-disciplinary teams with collaboration between scientists and engineers. The competition was launched in 2006 with competitions held annually every summer since 2007.

==Tasks (2019)==
Specific scenario details change each year as teams master given tasks and to encourage flexibility in designs and improve the capabilities of the rovers each year. Rovers are required to perform tele-operated or autonomous tasks that would assist astronauts in the field. Tele-operated tasks are performed from control stations with no direct view of the rover, only what can be determined via video and data links from the rover or sensors deployed by the rover. It is assumed the operators are also on Mars so there is no time-delay in communications. For 2017 tasks included:

=== System Acceptance Review (SAR) ===
Teams must submit a written report and a short video describing and demonstrating the design and capabilities of the rover to perform the required tasks, scientific plan, and team management. The SAR for the winning team of the 2018 competition can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HNwUhhus3A here].[[File:Mars_Society_University_Rover_Challenge_Hill_Climb.jpg|thumb|Rover climbs hill above Mars Desert Research Station in Mars Society University Rover Challenge]]

=== Science Mission ===
''"The goal is to conduct in-situ analysis with the rover, including life detection testing of samples"''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urc.marssociety.org/home/urc-news/2019universityroverchallengerulesreleased|title=2019 University Rover Challenge Rules Released - University Rover Challenge|website=urc.marssociety.org|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams must investigate multiple sites of biological interest, using instruments and methods of their choice, where they must conduct analysis of samples entirely on board the rover. The goal of the task is to determine the presence or absence of life, either extinct or extant, at designated sites. After the 20-30 minutes of investigation time, teams must also prepare a short presentation to give to the judges on-site, which presents their results, analysis, and conclusions. Analysis is expected to be relevant to the setting on Earth while demonstrating an understanding of how these observations would translate to a Martian setting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Mars_Society_University_Rover_Challenge_Rock_Garden.jpg|thumb|Rover traverses rock garden in Mars Society University Rover Challenge]]

=== Extreme Retrieval and Delivery Mission ===
''"rovers shall be required to pick up and deliver objects in the field, and deliver assistance to astronauts"''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Rovers must pick up and deliver objects in the field, such as screwdrivers, hammers, toolboxes, rocks, etc. Rovers are required to traverse a wide variety of terrain -- anything from soft sandy areas, to rock and boulder fields, to vertical drops. Teams are given approximate GPS coordinates for each pickup and delivery location, and potentially specific instructions for particular objects. Scoring is based on teams' ability to pick up and deliver objects to their correct locations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Equipment Servicing Mission ===
''"Rovers shall be required to perform several dexterous operations on a mock-up equipment system."''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Possible operations outlined in the rules for 2019 include:

* Operate a joystick, push buttons, flip switches, turn knobs
* Tighten captive screw to secure drawer
* Replace an electronics board using a rugged board-to-board connector
* Turn a hand crank

2017 required rovers to tow a wagon carrying a fuel canister to a generator, fill up the fuel tank, swap the regulator on gas cylinders, and start the generator by pressing a button. Previous equipment tasks have included pumping air into an inflatable habitat, and cleaning solar panels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Autonomous Travel Mission ===
''"Rovers shall be required to autonomously traverse between markers in this staged mission across moderately difficult terrain."''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Here, autonomous means without teleoperation -- that is, without operators from the base station giving commands or user input. The rover must do all its decision-making on board. However, teleoperated scouting is allowed in the earlier stages.

The markers in this task are tennis balls and approximate GPS coordinates given to teams. As the stages get more difficult, the GPS coordinates will become increasingly vague and there will be more between the tennis balls, requiring obstacle avoidance and autonomous route finding. In addition, teleoperated scouting is allowed in the earlier stages, but not in the later ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Judging ==
A panel of judges conducts the judging, and this panel changes from year to year. Some effort is made to have a diversity of experience on the judging team&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thespaceshow.com/show/25-may-2012/broadcast-1780-special-edition|title=Fri, 05/25/2012 - 00:00 {{!}} Kevin Sloan|website=www.thespaceshow.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and past judges have included persons with professional experience as: systems engineers&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;, biologists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/52087673/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/polish-students-design-best-mars-rover/#.W-SmGpNKjIU|title=Polish Students Design Best Mars Rover of 2013|date=2013-06-04|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, roboticists&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thespaceshow.com/node/457|title=Thu, 05/26/2011 - 00:00 {{!}} Kevin Sloan|website=www.thespaceshow.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, industrial designers&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;, scientists and professors of varied fields.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Judges are volunteers.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-06/rover-challenge-2010-university-teams-test-mars-rovers-utah-desert|title=Rover Challenge 2010: University Teams Test Mars Rovers in Utah Desert|work=Popular Science|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
Teams raise the money for the rovers themselves, through their university and/or outside sponsors.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; The competition itself is funded in part by the [[Mars Society]], but is also sponsored by [[TASC, Inc.|TASC Inc]]&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;, a defense contractor, and in more recent years Protocase Inc, a custom parts manufacturer, which offers teams credit and discounts for all parts manufactured at Protocase.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.protocase.com/community/sponsorship/rover-challenge.php|title=Protocase Goes Out of This World with the University Rover Challenge|last=Inc.|first=Protocase|work=protocase.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Inception ===
The idea behind the URC's creation is that the kinds of rovers teams are building would assist astronauts in the field, controlled remotely by another astronaut.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thespaceshow.com/show/20-jan-2009/broadcast-1093-special-edition|title=Tue, 01/20/2009 - 00:00 {{!}} Kevin Sloan|website=www.thespaceshow.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This imagined use case drives the competition's emphasis on teleoperation and ability to perform tasks that a human might need to. (Such as equipment servicing and retrieval and delivery)

In its first year, only 4 teams competed: University of Nevada Reno, Brigham Young University, Penn State University, and University of California Los Angeles. There were only 2 tasks, a Science Task, and a task to deploy a mock radio repeater in the field. URC spokesperson Kevin Sloan says they were unsure what to expect, but were "blown way by the quality".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; University of Nevada Reno won that year, winning a $5000 cash prize, which was reduced to $1000 in subsequent years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Evolution of Tasks ===
Since its inception in 2006, with 4 US teams, the competition has grown substantially, with 95 teams from 12 countries in 2018, and a total of 35 rovers selected to compete, their teams totaling more than 500 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urc.marssociety.org/home/urc-news/universityroverchallengetitlereturnstopoland|title=University Rover Challenge Title Returns to Poland - University Rover Challenge|website=urc.marssociety.org|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tasks have also undergone significant changes over the years, evolving from the 2 simple tasks of the first year to the 4 robust tasks of 2019, and continuing to get more challenging every year. Detailed information about  years 2007 - 2009 is unavailable, but by 2010 there were 4 tasks: Sample Return, Site Survey, Equipment Servicing, and Emergency Navigation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thespaceshow.com/node/457|title=Thu, 05/26/2011 - 00:00 {{!}} Kevin Sloan|website=www.thespaceshow.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2010 incarnation, sample return involved choosing a sample to bring back with the rover, then doing analysis on it at the base and presenting to the judges on its scientific significance. Site survey involved analysis of a site from potentially far away. Equipment servicing most notably required teams to plug in a 3-prong plug into an outlet, and emergency navigation was a timed challenge in which rovers were to locate astronauts as fast as possible. In addition to these tasks teams scored points on a presentation they gave to judges on the design of their rover.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The following two years saw tweaks in the content of tasks to make them increasingly challenging, but the spirit of each task remained the same. For example, in 2012, the emergency navigation task was designed such that in order to reach some of the astronauts rovers would need to pass into areas where they would lose communication with their operators and thus need to operate autonomously for a time.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thespaceshow.com/show/25-may-2012/broadcast-1780-special-edition|title=Fri, 05/25/2012 - 00:00 {{!}} Kevin Sloan|website=www.thespaceshow.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the Site Survey task was replaced with Terrain Traversing, which tested rovers capability of navigating through difficult terrain.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urc.marssociety.org/home/urc-news/urc2013finalscorebreakdown|title=URC2013 Final Score Breakdown - University Rover Challenge|website=urc.marssociety.org|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 introduced a formal down-selection process, including a CDR (Critical Design Review) which took the place of the Presentation task, and a semi-finals round of competition. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urc.marssociety.org/home/urc-news/firstdayofexcitementkicksoff2016universityroverchallenge|title=First Day of Excitement Kicks Off 2016 University Rover Challenge - University Rover Challenge|website=urc.marssociety.org|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urc.marssociety.org/home/urc-news/30studentteamsadvanceto2016universityroverchallengesemi-finals|title=30 Student Teams Advance to 2016 University Rover Challenge Semi-Finals - University Rover Challenge|website=urc.marssociety.org|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, 2017, replaced Astronaut Assistance with Extreme Retrieval and Delivery (a mix of astronaut assistance and terrain traversing), Sample Return with Science Cache, and Terrain Traversing with Autonomous Traversal, an entirely new challenge which explicitly required teams to implement autonomous behavior on their rovers.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urc.marssociety.org/home/about-urc/urc2017-scores|title=URC2017 Scores - University Rover Challenge|website=urc.marssociety.org|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, 2018 and 2019 have seen this task structure preserved, with increases in difficulty and complexity. Notably, the 2019 Science task requires detection of life aboard the rover, whereas in 2018 teams could bring back samples to conduct tests at the base.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Teams: ===
The number and diversity of teams has also grown significantly over the competition's lifespan. In 2018, 95 teams representing 10 different countries registered, 36 of which were selected to compete. Teams from the US generally make up the majority, but teams from Canada, Poland, and in more recent years, India, are also strongly represented. Poland in particular, fielding their first team in 2009, has been particularly competitive.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Citation|last=The Mars Society|title=(1 of 5) TASC University Rover Challenge, Kevin Sloan|date=2010-09-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDGd2TNhlQE|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Polish team from [[Częstochowa University of Technology|Czestochowa University of Technology]] won the 2018 competition, making 6 consecutive years Poland has been represented on the podium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urc.marssociety.org/home/urc-news/americanroverearnsworldstopmarsrovertitle|title=American Rover Earns World’s Top Mars Rover Title - University Rover Challenge|website=urc.marssociety.org|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some teams have been competed for many years in a row. Notably the team from [[Brigham Young University]] is the only team to have participated in every competition from 2006 to 2018, consistently placing in the top 5.&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Citation|last=The Mars Society|title=University Rover Challenge - 15th Annual International Mars Society Convention|date=2012-08-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=98&amp;v=Qi-j85eo0BM|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urc.marssociety.org/home/about-urc/history/urc2013|title=URC2013 - University Rover Challenge|website=urc.marssociety.org|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/education/college/byu/byu-mars-rover-headed-to-international-competition/article_b816d201-9e4a-5167-b20d-c58cbad52fa6.html|title=BYU Mars rover headed to international competition|last=Herald|first=Braley Dodson Daily|work=Daily Herald|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urc.marssociety.org/home/about-urc/urc2014-scores|title=URC2014 Scores - University Rover Challenge|website=urc.marssociety.org|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urc.marssociety.org/home/about-urc/urc2015-scores|title=URC2015 Scores - University Rover Challenge|website=urc.marssociety.org|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urc.marssociety.org/home/about-urc/urc2017-scores|title=URC2017 Scores - University Rover Challenge|website=urc.marssociety.org|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urc.marssociety.org/home/about-urc/urc2018-scores|title=URC2018 Scores - University Rover Challenge|website=urc.marssociety.org|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kathakali Drummer BNC.jpg|Chenda playing|thumb]]
The [[Chenda]] is a cylindrical [[percussion instrument]] used widely in the state of [[Kerala]], [[India]]. It is also used in some parts of [[Karnataka]] where it is called the Chande. The chenda is mainly played as an accompaniment in the [[Hindu]]religious art forms of Kerala. The chenda is used as an accompaniment for Kathakali, Koodiyattam, Kannyar Kali and among many forms of dances and rituals in Kerala. It is also played in a dance-drama called [[Yakshagana]] which is popular in Karnataka.

'''''Wicked''''' is a [[cast recording]] containing the majority of the songs from the [[Tony Award]]-winning Broadway [[Musical theatre|musical]] [[Wicked (musical)|''Wicked'']], with music and lyrics by composer [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] and a book by writer [[Winnie Holzman]]. Released on December 16, 2003 by [[Decca Broadway]] both in physical and digital releases. The former contains a foreword and a short synopsis, provided by [[Gregory Maguire]], who wrote the [[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West|1995 novel]] on which the musical is based, in addition to lyrics to those songs included.

Composer and lyricist of ''Wicked'', Stephen Schwartz, produced the album aided by [[Frank Filipetti]], Jill Dell'Abate, Jason Spears, Justin Shturtz, Jason Stasium and [[Ted Jensen]]. The original cast album of ''Wicked'' was recorded on November 10, 2003, with the full cast and orchestra, at then-[[MSR Studios|Right Track Studios]] and mastered at Sterling Sound in New York City.

The cast recording has received positive reviews and has received substantial commercial success. It received the 2005 [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album]] in 2005 and although initially peaking at number 125 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in 2003,&lt;ref name = "Soundscan2003"/&gt; has since reached the new peak of 66 in 2013. The album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] on November 30, 2006 by the [[RIAA]], but has since been certified double platinum, four years later, on November 8, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first= | last= | title=WICKED Cast Album Goes Double Platinum | date={{Date|2010-11-08}}| publisher= |url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/WICKED_Cast_Album_Goes_Double_Platinum_20101108 | work =BroadwayWorld.com |accessdate = {{Date|2010-11-11}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has sold 2,670,000 copies in the U.S. as of January 2017.&lt;ref name="US sales"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/music-news/chart-watch-taylor-swift-4-4-million-210041545.html | title=Chart Watch: Taylor Swift Is 4 For 4 (Million) | work=Yahoo Music | accessdate=February 19, 2014 | author=Paul Grein }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US sales update"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/columns/chart-beat/7655130/billboard-200-hamilton-cast-album-james-arthur-taylor-swift?client=safari |title=Hamilton passes 1 million sales plus chart highlights from James Arthur, Maren Morris and Taylor Swift | work=Billboard | accessdate=January 7, 2016 | author=Keith Caulfield }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notes===
*The reprise of "No One Mourns the Wicked" is attached to the beginning of "Thank Goodness".
*"The Wicked Witch of the East", sung by Nessarose, Elphaba, and Boq, is missing from the album. Producers deemed it too difficult to arrange for the album and thought the song would give too much of the plot away to an audience who had never seen ''Wicked'' before.
*Short reprises of "The Wizard and I" and "A Sentimental Man", that appear in Act I and II respectively, are not included. This is mainly because they are not technically considered full musical numbers.

'''Wine humour''' is [[humour]] associated with [[wine]].  As well as ordinary [[anecdote]]s, [[cartoon]]s and [[joke]]s, the whimsical [[wine label|label]]s and names given to wine are a particular source of amusement.&lt;ref name=GW&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AyQ4KR9rj5wC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Good Wine: The New Basics |author=Richard Paul Hinkle |isbn=978-1-930603-78-3 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humour is usually rare in the world of wine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X0wNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PG0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6920,3420447|title=Wine Humor: Saucy But Understated|last=Prial|first=Frank J.|date=22 April 1978|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wine jokes may only be amusing to wine obsessives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_TEaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Hw4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4303,4848725|title=There's something for every appetite at the Internet table|last=Husted|first=Bill|date=14 June 1997|work=Toledo Blade|accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Label humour==
Numerous wines have been given names which are deliberately amusing.  These form categories:&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{citation |journal=[[The Times]] |author=Tim Atkin |date=12 August 2010 |number=70024 |page=9 |title=Can I tempt you with a cool glass of Cat's Pee|url=http://www.thetimesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-152-694632,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puns===
The South African ''Goats do Roam Wine Company'', owned by [[Charles Back]], produces labels with names such as ''Goats do Roam'', ''Bored Doe'' and ''Goat-Roti''.  The [[Institut National des Appellations d'Origine]] (INAO) has protested at the similarity of these names to the French appellation [[Côtes du Rhône]] but owner [[Charles Back]]'s defence is that the names are based upon the goats which roam about his [[Fairview Wine and Cheese|Fairview]] winery and has made counter-protests with a herd of goats outside the French embassy.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goats&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.decanter.com/news/47909.html |journal=[[Decanter (magazine)|Decanter]] |title=Goats continue to Roam despite Rhône objections |date=17 February 2004 |author=Oliver Styles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-deprecation===
The New Zealand producer Cooper's Creek produces a [[Sauvignon blanc]] called ''Cat's Pee on a Gooseberry Bush'' which has sold well throughout the world.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;  This phrase to describe the distinctive taste of the New Zealand wines made from this grape variety was first coined by wine critic, [[Oz Clarke]].  The [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]], which controls the import of alcoholic drinks into the USA, insisted that the name should be changed to ''Cat's Phee on a Gooseberry Bush''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qfa--dt0UlcC&amp;pg=PA57 |title=Marilyn Merlot and the Naked Grape: Odd Wines from Around the World |author=Peter F. May |page=57 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual innuendo===
[[Wolf Blass]] created a sparkling Australian red wine called ''René Pogel''.  When people inquired who this person was, Blass advised them to read the name backwards ([[Alcohol and sex|leg opener]]).  This innuendo caused offence and so the wine was withdrawn from sale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/agribusiness/farm-magazine/bottle-oh/news-story/1ab6127ddfafcf9515f5080955d61f7e&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fantasy names===
The [[Bonny Doon Vineyard|Bonny Doon]] vineyard in California is famous for its amusing labels which include ''Le Cigare Volant''.  This recalls the resolution passed by the village council of [[Châteauneuf-du-Pape]] in 1954, forbidding the landing of [[flying saucer]]s in the region's vineyards.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSoxj_3e89MC&amp;pg=PA98 |title=Oz Clarke's New Wine Atlas: Wines and Wine Regions of the World |author=Oz Clarke |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-15-100913-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critters===
Critter brands feature animals on their labels - a style which started with the ''[[Yellow Tail (wine)|Yellow Tail]]'' brand in 2004.  These have a light-hearted, whimsical style which appeals to consumers who might be repelled by a more traditional style, which might seem too intimidating, pretentious or stuffy.  Sales figures in 2006 indicated that about 18% of new wine brands were styled in this way and that annual sales in the USA were about $600 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.winebusiness.com/wbm/?go=getArticle&amp;dataId=47410 |date=April 15, 2007 |title=Are Critter Labels Becoming Passé? |journal=Wine Business Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[d'Arenberg]] company in Australia is famous for the amusing names of its wines and one such is called ''The Hermit Crab''.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

==Anecdotes and jokes==
Anecdotes and jokes may be told about wine.  An old chestnut which has appeared in many contexts concerns a vineyard which sent its wine to a lab for analysis.  The report which was returned warned that "Your horse has diabetes!".&lt;ref name=GW/&gt;  The artist and wine enthusiast [[Ronald Searle]] has produced a book of cartoons and humour about wine called ''Something in the cellar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.winelit.slsa.sa.gov.au/winelore.htm |title=Wine Lore and Laughter |publisher=State Library of South Australia |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e64MAAAACAAJ |title=Something in the Cellar |author=Ronald Searle |publisher=Souvenir Press |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He also produced a collection of cartoons which satirised the art of [[wine-tasting]] &amp;mdash; ''The Illustrated Winespeak''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mBBKAAAAYAAJ |journal=[[Decanter (magazine)|Decanter]] |volume=32 |page=92 |year=2006 |title=Ronald Searle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yB3MPQAACAAJ |title=The Illustrated Winespeak |author=Ronald Searle |publisher=Souvenir Press |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The important place of '''women in dance''' can be traced back to the very origins of civilization. Cave paintings, Egyptian frescos, Indian statuettes, ancient Greek and Roman art and records of court traditions in China and Japan all testify to the important role women played in ritual and religious dancing from the start. In the [[Middle Ages]], what has become known as [[ballet]] had its beginnings in Italian court festivals when women frequently played the parts of men. It was however in late 17th-century France that the [[Paris Opera Ballet|Paris Opera]] produced the first celebrated ballerinas. While women began to dominate the ballet scene in the 18th century, it was with the advent of [[Romantic ballet]] in the 19th century that they became the undisputed centre of attraction with stars playing the leading roles in the works of [[Marius Petipa]], appearing in theatres across Europe from Milan's [[La Scala]] to the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in Saint Petersburg. More recently, women have played a leading role in developing various forms of [[modern dance]] including [[flamenco]] and [[expressionist dance]].

==History==
Women have always played a predominant role in dance, as can be seen from its earliest history until the emergence of formal dances in the 15th century which developed into [[ballet]].

===Antiquity===
Cave paintings from as long ago as 6000 BC provide scenes of dancing women. Examples can be seen in the [[Grotta dell'Addaura|Addauta Cave]] near [[Palermo]] and in the [[Roca dels Moros]] in [[Catalonia]]. In [[Ancient Egypt]], women performed ritual dances for religious ceremonies such as funerals, as illustrated by frescos on the pharaohs' tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/music.htm|title=Egyptia Dance and Music|publisher=Kibbutz Reshafim|accessdate=4 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest records of organised dance and of professional female dancers come from Egypt. Especially in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], women were organised into groups known as [[khener]], apparently being joined by men only at a later stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raqssharqisociety.org/femaledanceancientegypt.pdf|title=Female Dance in Ancient Egypt|author=Patricia Spencer|publisher=The Raqs Shardi Society|accessdate=4 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Indian subcontinent too, there is early evidence of dancing women, most notably a bronze statuette from [[Mohenjo-daro]] in the [[Indus Valley]] dating from around 2500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalmuseumindia.gov.in/prodCollections.asp?pid=44&amp;id=1&amp;lk=dp1|title=Pre-History &amp; Archaeology|publisher=National Museum, Janpath, New Delhi|accessdate=4 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webetab.ac-bordeaux.fr/Pedagogie/EPS/spip/IMG/pdf/les_grands_courants_danse.pdf|title=Les grands courants de la danse|author=Elisabeth Gouet|publisher=Académie de Bordeaux|accessdate=2 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; While men's early participation in dancing rituals appears to have been connected to hunting and fighting, women's dance was above all related to fertility, both agricultural and human.&lt;ref name=ml/&gt;

Dance in [[Ancient Crete|classical Crete]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] seems to have been influenced by the [[Dance and Dancers in Ancient Egypt|dances of Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/849211/Western-dance/22101/Dance-in-Classical-Greece#toc22102|title=Dance in classical Greece|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=6 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many examples of ancient Greek art from the 6th and 5th centuries BC depicting dancing women.&lt;ref name=ml&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvm.qc.ca/mlandry/folklore/historiq.htm|title=La Danse au fil des âges|author=Michel Landry|publisher=CÉGEP du Vieux Montréal|accessdate=2 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virgins of [[Delos]] danced in a circle to honour [[Apollo]]&lt;ref name="Calame2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Calame|first=Claude|title=Choruses of Young Women in Ancient Greece: Their Morphology, Religious Role, and Social Functions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DhfmgSz1eR4C&amp;pg=PA35|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-1525-3|pages=35–}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Terpsichore]] was the [[Muse]] of dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/588097/Terpsichore|title=Terpsichire|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=6 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century BC, the ''[[Greek chorus|choros]]'' became a lasting feature of Greek theatre while women known as the Dyonysiac, frequently depicted on Greek vases, dance in frensy, celebrating [[Dionysus]], the god of wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=ab82|title=History of Dance: Dance and Music|publisher=History World|accessdate=4 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Rome, female singers and dancers performed in the annual celebrations of [[Isis]] which included mystery plays representing the resurrection of [[Osiris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/suic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;prodId=SUIC&amp;action=e&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE|title=Women in Ancient Music: Arts and Humanitites Through the Eras|author= Edward I.

The Bible contains several accounts of women dancing, in particular the celebrations led by [[Miriam]] after the [[Crossing the Red Sea|crossing of the Red Sea]] when women are said to have danced and played hand-drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/women-with-hand-drums-dancing-bible|title=Women with hand-drums, dancing: Bible|author=Carol Meyers|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=4 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[David]] had returned from slaying [[Goliath]], women came out singing and dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/kjv/1_samuel/18-6.htm|title=1 Samuel 18:6|publisher=Bible Hub|accessdate=8 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], Matthew tells the story of how [[Salome]] danced for [[Herod the Great|Herod]] in order to be given the head of John the Baptist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2014-14&amp;version=NIV|title=John the Baptist Beheaded, Matthew 14-14|publisher=Bible Gateway|accessdate=6 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China and Japan===
In China too there is a long recorded history of women dancers since the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (c. 1046–256 BC) reaching a peak in the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 AD).&lt;ref name="aesthetic tradition"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d1eZuB2xwYwC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Chinese Aesthetic Tradition |author= Zehou Li |page=5 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |others=translated by Maija Bell Samei |year= 2009 |isbn=978-0824833077 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chorus dances performed by women in the Zhou dynasty were known as ''xi''. The [[Chinese variety art|ancient theatrical spectacles]] called ''baixi'' probably involved dancing girls in dresses with fluttering silk sleeves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xip.fi/atd/china/the-early-history-of-chinese-theatre.html|title=The Early History of Chinese Theatre|publisher=Theatre Academy Helsinki|accessdate=6 April 2014 |isbn=978-952-9765-56-0|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texts from the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771–476 BC) contain descriptions of professional dancing girls while the Nishang Yuyi dance, created by the Emperor [[Li Longji]] (685–762), stages virgin women dancing as if in a magic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israeldance.co.il/toldot/articles/153|title=Dance History of China|author=Yaron Margolin|publisher=Israel Dance|accessdate=6 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 12th-century Japan, the [[Shirabyoshi]] were famous for their dancing and poetry. One of the most famous was the court dancer [[Shizuka Gozen|Shizuka]] who appears in the Japanese literature of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immortalgeisha.com/history_01.php|title=History of the Geisha, Part One: 1100AD - 1750AD|publisher=Immortal Geisha|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
In the [[Middle Ages]], with the spread of Christianity across Europe, the church generally frowned upon dance although there was often dancing at [[folk dance|folk festivals]], particularly at the beginning of May. In France and Italy, chain and circular dances such as the ''[[Carol (music)|carole]]'', and the ''tresque'' were popular from the 4th to 14th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamarotte.fr/?page_id=586|title=Danses médiévales et renaissance|publisher=La Marotte|accessdate=6 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually danced in a closed circle with men and women interspersed and holding hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullally|first=Robert|title=The Carole: A Study of a Medieval Dance|location=Farnham, Surrey, England|publisher=Ashgate|year=2011|pages=41–50|isbn=978-1-4094-1248-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, the lively [[saltarello]] from Naples became popular in the 14th and 15th centuries. Groups of [[courtesan]]s dressed as men performed the dance at [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]]s.&lt;ref name="Caroso1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caroso|first=Fabritio|title=Courtly Dance of the Renaissance: A New Translation and Edition of the Nobiltà Di Dame (1600)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBwqMyKQvM4C&amp;pg=PA43|year=1995|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-28619-8|pages=43–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of ballet==
In the 15th century, court festivities in Italy became ever more elaborate, often featuring formal dances. One of the early masters was [[Domenico da Piacenza]] (c. 1400–1470) who compiled a manual of dance: ''De arte saltandi et choreas ducendi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/pnd/|title=De arte saltandi et choreas ducendi|publisher=pbm.com|accessdate=8 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, too, professional dancing began to take shape when dancers performed for [[Henry III of France]] at [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] in the early 1580s. Further presentations were made for [[Louis XIII]], who frequently took the main part himself. But it was, above all, during the reign of [[Louis XIV]] (1643–1715) that the foundations were laid for what became known as ballet. The king not only had the rules of dance written down but established the [[Académie Royale de Danse]] in 1661, which developed into today's [[Paris Opera Ballet]].&lt;ref name=ml/&gt; Many of the early ballets were created by the Italian-French composer [[Jean Baptiste Lully]] and the French choreographer [[Pierre Beauchamp]], often assisted by [[Molière]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/yiannis/dance/history.html|title=History of Ballet|publisher=Northeastern University|accessdate=8 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, female parts in the early ballets were taken by young men; but, in 1681, a young woman known as [[De Lafontaine|Mademoiselle De Lafontaine]] danced in Lully's ''Le Triomphe de l'amour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/326306/La-Fontaine|title=La Fontaine
|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to be the leading ballerina in at least 18 other productions at the Paris Opera between 1681 and 1693, establishing the supreme importance of women in ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100047735|title=Mlle de Lafontaine|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Lafontaine was succeeded by [[Marie-Thérèse de Subligny]] who became the first ballerina to perform in London when she appeared with [[Claude Ballon]] in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100539716|title=Marie-Thérèse Subligny|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said to be the best ballerina of her day, with beautiful eyes and a fine figure, Subligny danced at the Paris Opera from 1688 until her retirement in 1707.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://operabaroque.fr/Cadre_baroque.htm|title=Le Triomphe de l'amour|publisher=Le magazine de l'opéra baroque|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next leading dancer of the Opéra was [[Françoise Prévost]] (1680–1741), whose precision, lightness and grace contributed much to classical ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/475670/Francoise-Prevost|title=Françoise Prévost|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She persuaded conductor [[Jean-Féry Rebel]] to compose suites specifically for ballet. His ''Caprice'', ''Boutade'', ''Les Caractères de la danse'' and ''La Terpsichore'' brought her considerable success. In particular, her personal interpretation of the steps in ''Caprice'' served as an example for other soloists while she transformed the ''Caractères'' into a sequence illustrating different types of lover, both male and female. Prévost trained two highly successful dancers, [[Marie-Anne de Cupis de Camargo|Marie Camargo]] (1710–1770) and [[Marie Sallé]] (1707–1756), who added their personal preferences to her ''Caractères'', each developing individual styles. They would take her place as [[prima ballerina]]s after she retired from the opera in 1730.&lt;ref name="Brooks2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Lynn|title=Women’s Work: Making Dance in Europe Before 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=By5TNdV4dGUC&amp;pg=PA131|year=2007|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-22530-8|pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greskovic2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greskovic|first=Robert|title=Ballet 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving the Ballet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2COs6yh_LS0C&amp;pg=PA19|year=2005|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-0-87910-325-5|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camargo proved to be a tremendous success, not only as a result of her dazzling footwork (especially her [[entrechat|entrechat à quatre]]), but because she introduced slightly shorter skirts and new hair styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/90467/Marie-Camargo|title=Marie Camargo|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also discarded high-heeled shoes, introducing dancing slippers which facilitated the execution of the more demanding routines.&lt;ref name="Kassing2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kassing|first=Gayle|title=History of Dance: An Interactive Arts Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lLoTsT2X5EC&amp;pg=PA113|year=2007|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-6035-6|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt; By dancing demanding routines, which had previously been performed exclusively by men, Camargo further consolidated the image of the ballerina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1700-1750.html|title=

Sallé sought more from ballet than skillful demonstrations of technique as favoured by proponents of traditional ballet. She believed music, steps, decor and costumes should all contribute to a graceful, expressive performance combining [[pantomime]] with dance in what became known as [[ballet d'action]]. As many in the Paris Opera did not share her views, she decided to move to the more liberal London. At [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], she caused a sensation in 1734 as Galatea in ''Pygmalion'', a ballet she had choreographed herself. Discarding the usual attire of a ballerina, she chose to wear a simple muslin tunic and allow her hair to fall freely over her shoulders.&lt;ref name="Garfunkel2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garfunkel|first=Trudy|title=On Wings of Joy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyTwwDm3YT4C&amp;pg=PA20|year=2002|publisher=E-reads/E-rights|isbn=978-0-7592-2862-7|pages=20–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she even decided to dress as a man while performing the role of Cupid but the reviews were extremely critical. As a result, she returned to Paris where she danced at the Opéra until her retirement in 1740 at the young age of 33. Thereafter, she occasionally danced for the court at [[Château de Versailles|Versailles]].&lt;ref name="Brooks2007"/&gt;

During the second half of the 18th century, the dominating star of the Paris Opera was [[Marie-Madeleine Guimard]] who may not have had the technique of Sallé but was nevertheless recognized for her sensuous movements, her numerous suitors and her exotic attire. Other stars included [[Marie Allard]] (1738–1802) who joined the Paris Opera in 1756 where she was trained by [[Gaétan Vestris]], becoming not just an étoile but also his wife. Although she was rather corpulent and frequently pregnant, she was acclaimed for her impressive footwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1750-1830.html|title=La Danseuse: Evolution et Révolution: Les années 1750 à 1830|publisher=Mount Holyoke|accessdate=11 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic ballet==
The most successful period for female ballet dancers was around the 1830s and 1840s when they became the great stars of [[Romantic ballet]]. The Italian-Swedish [[Marie Taglioni]] (1804–1884) not only excelled at the Paris Opera when she danced ''[[La Sylphide]]'' in 1832 but extended her fame to Saint Petersburg's [[Mariinsky Ballet]] as well as to the stages of Berlin, Milan and London until her retirement in 1847. It was she who developed ballet's [[en pointe]] (dancing on the tips of the toes) while introducing new fashions in dress and hair styling which became popular throughout Europe. The Austrian [[Fanny Elssler]] (1810–1884) gained fame and fortune by dancing the flirtatious Spanish [[cachucha]] in ''Le Diable boiteux'', performing not only in Austria, Germany, France, England and Russia but also in the United States. Nevertheless, in 1845 she refused to dance with her rivals Marie Taglioni, [[Carlotta Grisi]], [[Fanny Cerrito]], and [[Lucile Grahn]] in [[Jules Perrot]]'s ''[[Pas de Quatre]]''.&lt;ref name=vam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/r/romantic-ballet/|title=Romantic Ballet|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=16 April 2014|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1830-1848.html|title=La Danseuse: Evolution et Révolution: Les années 1830 à 1848:La danse romantique|publisher=Mount Holyoke|accessdate=16 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presented at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in London, the ''Pas de Quatre'' caused a sensation, bringing together the four greatest ballerinas of the day. In addition to Marie Taglioni, Italy's Grisi (1819–1899) had become famous both in Paris and Saint Petersburg for her ''[[Giselle]]'', while Cerrito from Naples had become the star of [[La Scala]] in Milan. Grahn (1819–1907), a Dane trained by Bournonville, was based in Paris but had also danced in London, Saint Petersburg and Milan before settling in Germany.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Several notable Italian ballerinas emerged in the second half of the 19th century, reaching their zeniths in Russia. Italian-born [[Virginia Zucchi]] (1849–1933) first danced in Italy and Germany but her interpretations of [[Marius Petipa]]'s ballet in Russia were so successful that the Tzar insisted she should join the [[Mariinsky Ballet]] in Saint Petersburg. In the mid-1880s, she starred in ''[[Coppélia]]'', ''[[La fille mal gardée]]'' and ''[[La Esmeralda (ballet)|La Esmeralda]]'', revolutionizing ballet in Russia through the extraordinary power of her performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803133549548|title=Virginia Zucchi|publisher=Oxford Index|accessdate=17 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierina Legnani]] (1863–1930) from Milan followed as similar path, also dancing at the Mariinsky from 1892 where she originated famous roles in Petipa's ballets including ''[[Cinderella (Fitinhof-Schell)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and ''[[Raymonda]]'', gaining the title of [[prima ballerina assoluta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100058642|title=Pierina Legnani|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=17 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlotta Brianza]] (1867–1930), also from Milan, first gained fame at [[La Scala]] with which she toured the United States.

==20th-century ballet==
New, more dynamic approaches to ballet developed from the beginning of the 20th century, the most influential being [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]], promoting innovative collaborations between choreographers, composers and dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/ART309940|title=

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Ballet also began to develop in London, thanks mainly to the efforts of two women. Polish-born [[Marie Rambert]] (1888–1982) who had also gained experience with the Ballets Russes founded the [[Ballet Club]] (later the Rambert Dance Company) in 1926 introducing new choreographers such as [[Frederick Ashton]]. Even more influential, [[Ninette de Valois]] (1898–2001) spent three years with the Ballets Russes before creating London's [[Vic-Wells Ballet]] in 1931 (later becoming the Royal Ballet) where [[Alicia Markova]] (1910–2004) was the first prima ballerina, starring in ballets from the Mariinsky's classical productions. Markova left to form her own touring company in 1937. Ten years later [[Margot Fonteyn]] (1919–1991) became the company's prima ballerina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/e/establishment-of-british-ballet/|title=The Establishment of British Ballet|publisher=V&amp;A|accessdate=23 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The height of her fame came in 1961 when she embarked on a partnership with [[Rudolf Nureyev]], first in ''[[Giselle]]'', until she retired in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nureyev.org/rudolf-nureyev-biography-margot-fonteyn/|title=Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn, the perfect partnership|publisher=Rudolf Nureyev Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As ballet developed in the United States, [[Maria Tallchief]] (1925–2013), the first major American prima ballerina, was promoted by the choreographer [[Bronislava Nijinska]] (1891–1972) when she joined the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]] in New York in 1942. She danced as a soloist in [[George Balanchine]]'s arrangements for ''[[Song of Norway]]'' in 1944. As Balanchine's wife, she soon became the star of the [[New York City Ballet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/arts/dance/maria-tallchief-brilliant-ballerina-dies-at-88.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Maria Tallchief, a Dazzling Ballerina and Muse for Balanchine, Dies at 88|author=Jack Anderson|newspaper=New York Times|date=12 April 2013|accessdate=24 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucia Chase]] (1897–1986) was a co-founder of the [[American Ballet Theatre]] in 1939 and became its artistic director for over 40 years, overseeing the production of a wide variety of new ballets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/arts/dance-view-lucia-chase-helped-create-the-ballet-world-we-know.html|title=Dance View: Lucia Chase Helped Create the Ballet World we Know|author=Anna Kisselgoff|newspaper=New York Times|date=19 January 1986|accessdate=24 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several outstanding American ballerinas have emerged over the years including [[Gelsey Kirkland]] (born 1952), who performed the leading role in ''[[The Firebird]]'' when she was just 17,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/gelsey-kirkland-9365803#controversy-and-comeback&amp;awesm=~oCmUgMJASHMm00|title=Gelsey Kirkland|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=24 April 2014|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Suzanne Farrell]] (born 1945) who was the star of Balanchine's ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'' in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/far0bio-1|title=Suzanne Farrell Biography|publisher=Academy of Achievement|accessdate=24 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms of dance==
[[File:Flamenco dancer 3467.jpg|thumb|200px|Flamenco dancer]]
Women have also contributed significantly to most other forms of dance, in particular [[flamenco]], [[modern dance]], [[expressionist dance]], [[belly dance]] and [[cabaret]] which led to [[musical theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsalive.ca/en/dan/dance101/forms.asp|title=Dance Forms: An Introduction |publisher=ArtsAlive.ca|accessdate=17 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flamenco===
Flamenco music originated in the south of Spain in the 15th century, probably resulting from the influence of the Moors with possible origins in India. While many of the singers who emerged in the 18th century were men, women increasingly gained fame as dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andalucia.org/es/flamenco/evolucion-etapa-hermetica-primeros-cantaores/|title=Flamenco: Evolución. Etapa Hermética. Primeros cantaores|publisher=Andalucía.org|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest was [[Juana la Macarrona]] (1860–1947) who first performed in Seville with singer [[Silverio Franconetti]] but soon become popular not only throughout Spain but across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyoflamenco.es/index.php/aula-flamenca/artistas/baile/509-la-macarrona|title=La Macarrona|publisher=Noticias y Ocio|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lola Flores]] (1923–1995) is remembered for singing and dancing Andalusian folklore, especially flamenco, [[copla (music)|copla]] and [[chotis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andalucia.com/history/people/lolaflores.htm|title=Lola Flores|publisher=Andalucia.com|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angelita Vargas]] (born 1946) is considered to be one of the greatest stars of Andalusian flamenco dancing, touring Europe, the United States, Japan and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsaraflamenco.fr/Angelita-Vargas.html?lang=fr|title=Angelita Vargas|publisher=Apsâra Flamenco|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern dance===
Led by women, various styles of [[modern dance]] began to develop towards the end of the 19th century. [[Loie Fuller]] (1862–1928) from Chicago was one of the pioneers. She employed her own natural approach to movement and improvisation, later becoming a star at the [[Folies Bergères]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsalive.ca/en/dan/meet/bios/artistDetail.asp?artistID=168|title=Loie Fuller|publisher=Dance: National Arts Centre|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Greek art, [[Isadora Duncan]] (1877–1927) from San Francisco paved the way to the modern free dance style believing it was more important to express the essence of life through movement rather than to follow the precepts of classical ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdc.edu/wolfson/academic/ArtsLetters/art_philosophy/Humanities/beginnings/beginnings_of_modern_dance.htm|title=The Beginnings of Modern Dance|publisher=Miami Dade College|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised on a farm in New Jersey, [[Ruth St. Denis]] (1879–1968) developed her own interpretations of Oriental dance as an expression of spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danceheritage.org/treasures/stdenis_essay_hecht.pdf|title=Ruth St. Denis (1879—1968): America's Divine Dancer |publisher=Dance Heritage Coalition|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Martha Graham]] (1894–1991) exerted considerable influence on the development of modern dance through her New York-based [[Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095902861|title=Martha Graham|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other female figures who contributed to developments in the mid-20th century include [[Doris Humphrey]] (1895–1958) who choreographed Afro-American spirituals and [[Helen Tamiris]] (1905–1966) who played an important part in choreographing early musicals.&lt;ref name="HendersonStacey2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=Lol|last2=Stacey|first2=Lee|title=Encyclopedia of Music in the 20th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8W2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-92946-6|pages=41–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/tamiris-helen|title=Helen Tamaris|author=Pauline Tish|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major choreographer of Broadway musicals was German-born [[Hanya Holm]] (1893–1992), a student of Mary Wigman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/04/theater/hanya-holm-is-dead-at-99-influential-choreographer.html|title=Hanya Holm Is Dead at 99; Influential Choreographer|author=Jennifer Dunning|newspaper=New York Times|date=4 November 1992|accessdate=20 April 2014|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expressionist dance===
The German [[Mary Wigman]] is credited as the creator of [[expressionist dance]]. Inspired by Oriental percussion, she often stressed the macabre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theatre-dance.cahss.ualr.edu/waynesweb/Expressionism/ExpressionisticDance.htm|title=Expressionistic Dance: Mary Wigman|publisher=Twentieth Century Dance|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hertha Feist]] (1896–1990), also from Germany, was an expressionist dancer and choreographer. She established her own school in Berlin, combining gymnastics with nudism and dance although her ambitions were later seriously curtailed by the Nazis.&lt;ref name=fmp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk-kultur.de/tanz/feist2.htm|title=Feist|author=Frank-Manuel Peter|publisher=SK Stiftung Kultur|accessdate=19 February 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also an associate of Wigman, [[Gret Palucca]] (1902–1993) opened her own schools in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s but they were later closed because of her Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adk.de/de/archiv/archivbestand/darstellende-kunst/kuenstler/Gret_Palucca.htm|title=Gret Palucca|publisher=Akademie der Künste|accessdate=19 April 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her students, [[Dore Hoyer]] (1911–1967), who was also an associate of Mary Wigman, developed her own programmes before the [[Second World War]] in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden.

===Belly dance===
While belly dancing appears to have its origins in the distant past, it was introduced to Europe and North America towards the end of the 19th century. Several of Egypt's film actresses performed belly dancing in the musicals of the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aleenah.com/history.html|title=Bellydance Unveiled: A Brief History|publisher=Aleenah.com|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early stars included [[Tahia Carioca]] (1919–1999), [[Samia Gamal]] (1924–1994) and [[Nelly Mazloum]] (1929–2003).&lt;ref name="Hammond2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Andrew|title=Popular Culture in the Arab World: Arts, Politics, and the Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O06bOHRW7s8C&amp;pg=PA192|year=2007|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=978-977-416-054-7|pages=192–}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1960s, belly dance became increasingly popular across the United States with stars including [[Dalilah (bellydancer)]] (1936–2001), Dahlena and [[Serena Wilson|Serena]] (1933–2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellydance.org/articles/bellydance_history.html|title=Belly Dance History ~ An American Odessey: A History of Modern US Bellydance|author=Helen Waldie|publisher=IAMED|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabaret===
