      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3992">An '''adventive species''' is a species that has arrived in a new locality. It may have had help from humans as an [[introduced species]] or it may not.

The term is now used by some writers in a more restricted sense than its initial usage. The earliest and most widespread concept among biologists is that of a species that has arrived in a specific geographic area from a different region (without further caveats). This is the forerunner of the term 'non-indigenous species', although it lacks the frequently invoked basis of the word 'introduced', which means different things to different writers.&lt;ref&gt;Morse A.P. 1916. "[http://psyche.entclub.org/pdf/23/23-178.pdf A New England orthopteran adventive]". ''Psyche'' 23: 178-179. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Townes H.K. 1947. "[http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/16163/PHES13_105-106.pdf?sequence=1 A ''Eumenes'' wasp and six adventive Ichneumonidae new to Hawaii (Hymenoptera)]". ''Proceedings of the Hawaiian Entomological Society'' 13: 105-105 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton C.E. 1964. "[http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pi/pdf/6(4)-689.pdf Highlights in the history of entomology in Hawaii 1778-1963]". ''Pacific Insects'' 6: 689-729 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank J.H., McCoy E.D. 1995. "[http://journals.fcla.edu/flaent/article/view/74655/72313 Introduction to insect behavioral ecology: The good, the bad, and the beautiful: Non-indigenous species in Florida. Invasive adventive insects and other organisms in Florida]". ''Florida Entomologist'' 78: 1-15 &lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the [[cattle egret]] (''Bubulcus ibis''), which arrived in North America by natural range expansion, the [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''), which is believed to have arrived as a hitchhiker aboard ships, and the [[kudzu]] vine (''Pueraria lobata''), which was introduced deliberately by humans, are all adventive species and have established populations. Common adventive species include herbivorous insects.&lt;ref&gt;Martin N.A., Paynter Q. 2013. Predicting risk from adventive herbivores to New Zealand indigenous plants. ''New Zealand Entomologist'': 1-8. DOI:10.1080/00779962.2012.759308&lt;/ref&gt;

The later and more limited concept is that of a species that has arrived in a specific geographic area from a different region, but its population is not self-sustaining. Population numbers are only increased through re-introduction. After some time, an adventive species may become [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]]; or, some populations do not sustain themselves reproductively, but exist because of continued influx from elsewhere. Such a non-sustaining population, or the individuals within it, are said to be adventive.&lt;ref name="WHS1999"&gt;Warren L. Wagner, Derral R. Herbst, and Sy H. Sohmer. ''Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaii'', Revised Edition, 1999. Bishop Museum Press: Honolulu&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plant cultivation|Cultivated]] plants are a major source of adventive populations. It is estimated that 10-20% of adventive species used in [[biological control]] programs eventually become naturalized.&lt;ref&gt;Stiling, P. 1993. Why do natural enemies fail in classical Biological Control Programs? ''American Entomologist''. 39:31-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

We can readily see how this second (later) concept applies to cultivated plants. Those that grow within the confines of culture are ‘adventive’; those that grow outside those confines are ‘naturalized’. But the concept falls apart when applied to the far more numerous species of invertebrate animals and microorganisms: extremely few of these are cultured, and by the time they are detected in nature they tend to be established (‘naturalized’).

[[File:Bethel, 72.Holy land photographed. Daniel B. Shepp. 1894-1.jpg|250px|thumb|Bethel. From the book ''Holy Land'' photographed by Daniel B. Shepp. 1894]]

'''Bethel''' ([[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]]: ''bt il'', meaning "[[Bethel (god)|House of El]]" or "House of God",&lt;ref name=Bleekerp257&gt;Bleeker and Widegren, 1988, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-he-n|בֵּית אֵל}} ''ḇêṯ’êl'', also [[transliteration|transliterated]] ''Beth El'', ''Beth-El'', ''Beit El''; {{lang-el|Βαιθηλ}}; {{lang-la|Bethel}}) was a border city described in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as being located between [[Benjamin]] and [[Ephraim]] and also a location named by Jacob. Under [[Israelite]] rule, Bethel first belonged to the [[Tribe of Benjamin]], but was later conquered by the [[Tribe of Ephraim]].

[[Eusebius of Caesarea]] and [[Jerome]] describe Bethel in their time as a small village that lay 12 Roman miles north of [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Jerusalem]], to the right or east of the road leading to [[Nablus|Neapolis]].&lt;ref name=Robinsonp449&gt;Robinson and Smith, 1856, pp. 449–450.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholar [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] identified the village of [[Beitin]] in the [[West Bank]] with ancient Bethel in ''[[Biblical Researches in Palestine]], 1838–52''. He based this assessment on its fitting the location described in earlier texts, and on the philological similarities between the modern and ancient name, arguing that the replacement of the Hebrew ''el'' with the Arabic ''in'' was not unusual.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=oYearm8YobQC&amp;pg=PA270&amp;lpg=PA270&amp;dq=bethel+palestine+19th+century&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YrRXuJnfos&amp;sig=9e5zCklq2A3L6Ccc_D14SyzpHTY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo5sfq4qTNAhXoA8AKHVpPBmQQ6AEIMjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=bethel%20palestine%2019th%20century&amp;f=false Confronting the Past: Archaeological and Historical Essays on Ancient Israel in Honor of William G. Dever, ed. Gitin, Wright and Dessel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years after the [[Six-Day War]], the biblical name was applied to an [[Israeli settlement]] [[Beit El]] constructed adjacent to Beitin. In several countries—particularly in the US—the name has been given to various locations (see [[Bethel (disambiguation)]]).

==History==
[[File:El sueño de Jacob, por José de Ribera.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Jacob's dream at Bethel, by [[José de Ribera]].]]
Bethel is mentioned several times in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. It is first mentioned in Genesis 12 and 13,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/i/t/t0112.htm Genesis 12 / בראשית י"ב (Origin)], [http://bible.cc/genesis/12-8.htm Genesis 12:8 (Translation)]&lt;/ref&gt; as a place near where [[Abraham|Abram]] stayed and built an altar on his way to Egypt and on his return. It is said to be close to Hai ([[Ai (Canaan)|Ai]]) and just to the west of it. More famously it is mentioned again in Genesis 28,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/i/t/t0128.htm Genesis 28 / בראשית כ"ח (Origin)], [http://bible.cc/genesis/28-19.htm Genesis 28:19 (Translation)]&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Jacob]], fleeing from the wrath of his brother [[Esau]], falls asleep on a stone and [[Jacob's Ladder (Bible)|dreams of a ladder]] stretching between Heaven and Earth and thronged with [[angels]]; God stands at the top of the ladder, and promises Jacob the land of [[Canaan]]; when Jacob awakes he anoints the stone ([[baetylus]]) with oil and names the place Bethel. Another account, from Genesis 35&lt;ref&gt;[http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/i/t/t0135.htm Genesis 35 / בראשית ל"ה  (Origin)], [http://bible.cc/genesis/35-7.htm Genesis 35:7 (Translation)]&lt;/ref&gt; repeats the covenant with God and the naming of the place (as El-Bethel), and makes this the site of Jacob's own change of name to Israel. Both versions state that the original name of the place was [[Luz]], a Canaanite name.

Bethel is mentioned again in the book of Joshua 7:2, 8:9 as being close to Ai and on the west side of it; in this episode [[Joshua]] sent men from [[Jericho]] to capture Ai. At Joshua 16:1 it is again said to be next to Luz, near Jericho, and part of the territory of the descendants of Joseph (that is [[Manasseh]] and [[Ephraim]], cf. Joshua 16:4).

In the book of Judges 1:22 ff the descendants of Joseph capture the city of Bethel, which again is said to have previously been called Luz. At Judges  4:5 the prophetess [[Deborah]] is said to dwell at Bethel under the palm-tree of Deborah (presumably a reference to Genesis 35:8, where another [[Deborah (Genesis)|Deborah]], the nurse of Jacob's mother [[Rebecca]], is said to have been buried under a tree at Bethel). Bethel is said in Judges 4:5 to be in Mt [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]].

At Judges 20:18, where the Hebrew Beth-El is translated in the King James Version as the 'House of God', the people of Israel go to Bethel to ask counsel of God when they are planning to attack the Benjaminites at the [[battle of Gibeah]]. They make a second visit (Judges 20:26) after losing the battle. Bethel was evidently already an important religious centre at this time; so important in fact that the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was kept there, under the care of [[Phinehas]] the grandson of [[Aaron]] (Judges 20:27f). At Judges 21:19, Bethel is said to be south of [[Shiloh (Biblical city)|Shiloh]]. At the next mention of the Ark, in 1 Samuel 4:3, it is said to be kept at Shiloh.

In the book I Samuel 7:16, it is said that the prophet [[Samuel]], who resided at [[Ramah in Benjamin|Ramah]], used to make a yearly circuit of Bethel, [[Gilgal]] and [[Mizpah in Benjamin|Mizpah]] to judge Israel. At I Samuel 10:3, Samuel tells [[Saul]] to go to Bethel to visit the 'Hill of God', where he will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with a 'psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp'. It appears that there was a Philistine garrison there at that time. Bethel is mentioned again in I Samuel 13:2 and 2 Samuel 30:27.
[[File:Jeroboam's Temple in Bet El IMG 1944.JPG|thumb|Ruins of Jeroboam's temple in Bethel]]
After the kingdom of Israel was split into two kingdoms on the death of King [[Solomon]] (c.931 BC), [[Jeroboam]], the first king of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], made two calves of gold (1 Kings 12:28 ff) and set one up in Bethel, and the other in [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]] in the far north of his kingdom. This was apparently to make it unnecessary for the people of Israel to have to go to Jerusalem to worship in the temple there. It seems that this action provoked the hostility of the Judaeans. A story is told at 1 Kings 13:1 ff of how a man from [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] visited the shrine at Bethel and prophesied that it would eventually be destroyed by [[Josiah]].

At 2 Kings 2:1ff the prophets [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]] are said to have visited Bethel on a journey from [[Gilgal]] to Jericho shortly before Elijah was taken up to heaven without dying (2 Kings 2:11). (9th century BC). Later, when Elisha returned alone to Bethel, he is said to have been taunted by some young men (not 'young boys' as it is translated in some English Bibles) as he climbed up to the shrine, and cursed them; whereupon 42 of the young men were killed by bears (2 Kings 2:23ff). 

Bethel is next mentioned in connection with the tenth king of Israel, [[Jehu]] (c.842-815 BC). Despite his killing of the prophets of Baal and destruction of their temple, it is said that Jehu continued to tolerate the presence of the golden calves in Bethel and Dan. (2 Kings 10:29). The shrine at Bethel apparently avoided destruction in the Assyrian invasions of the kingdom of Israel in c.740 and 722, but was finally completely destroyed by King [[Josiah]] of Judah (c.640-609 BC). 

Bethel is mentioned in Ezra 2:28 and Nehemiah 7:32 as being resettled at the time of the return of the exiles from Babylon.

The shrine is mentioned with disapproval by the prophet [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] (c. 750):

&lt;blockquote&gt;But seek not Beth–el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer–sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth–el shall come to nought. -King James Bible&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But prophesy not again any more at Beth–el: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court. -King James Bible&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A few years later the prophet [[Hosea]] (10:15) (8th century BC) speaks of the "wickedness" of Bethel (at least according to modern translations) and [[Jeremiah]] (48:13) (6th century BC) speaks of the "shame" which it brought on Israel.  Hosea 13:1–3 describes how the Israelites are abandoning Adonai for the worship of Baal, and accuses them of making or using images for 'idol' worship. Chief among these, it appears, was the image of the bull at Bethel, which by the time of Hosea was being worshipped as an image of Baal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = The Social Roots of Biblical Yahwism, Part 2 | author = Stephen L. Cook | publisher = Society of Biblical Literature |year=2004 |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bethel was again inhabited and fortified by [[Bacchides (general)|Bacchides the Syrian]] in the time of the [[Maccabees]].&lt;ref name=Robinsonp449/&gt; [[Josephus]] tells us that Bethel was captured by [[Vespasian]]. Robinson notes that after the writings of [[Eusebius]] and [[Jerome]], he found no further references to Bethel in the written historical record. However, he notes that the ruins at [[Beitin]] are greater than those of a village and seem to have undergone expansion after the time of Jerome, noting also the presence of what appear to be ruins of churches from the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=Robinsonp449/&gt;

{{Journalism sidebar}}
'''Broadcast journalism''' is the field of news and journals which are "broadcast", that is, published by electrical methods instead of the older methods, such as printed newspapers and posters. Broadcast methods include radio (via air, cable, and Internet), television (via air, cable, and Internet) and the World Wide Web. Such media disperse pictures (static and moving), visual text and sounds.

==Description==
Broadcast articles can be written as "packages", "readers", "[[voice-over]]s" (VO) and "[[sound on tape]]" (SOT).

A "sack" is an edited set of video clips for a news story and is common on television. It is typically narrated by a reporter. It is a story with audio, video, graphics and video effects. The [[news anchor]], or presenter, usually reads a "lead-in" (introduction) before the package is aired and may conclude the story with additional information, called a "tag".

A "reader" is an article read without accompanying video or sound. Sometimes an "over the shoulder [[digital on-screen graphic]]" is added.

A voice-over, or VO, is a video article narrated by the anchor.

Sound on tape, or SOT, is sound or video usually recorded in the field. It is usually an interview or soundbite.

Radio was the first medium for broadcast journalism. Many of the first radio stations were co-operative [[community radio]] ventures not making a profit. Later, [[radio advertising]] to pay for programs was pioneered in radio. Later still, television displaced radio and newspapers as the main news sources for most of the public in industrialized countries.

Some of the programming on radio is locally produced and some is broadcast by a radio network, for example, by [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]. The "talent" (professional voices) talk to the audience, including reading the news. People tune in to hear engaging radio personalities, music, and information. In radio news, stories include speech soundbites, the recorded sounds of events themselves, and the anchor or host.

Some radio news might run for just four minutes, but contain 12–15 stories. These new bulletins must balance the desire for a broad overview of current events with the audience's limited capacity to focus on a large number of different stories.&lt;ref name="Fleming2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carole Fleming|title=The Radio Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=btKOAgAAQBAJ|date=10 September 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-25810-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radio industry has undergone a radical consolidation of ownership, with fewer companies owning the thousands of stations.  Large media conglomerates such as [[Clear Channel Communications]] own most of the radio stations in the United States. That has resulted in more "[[niche market|niche]]" formats and the sharing of resources within clusters of stations, de-emphasizing local news and information. There has been concern over whether this concentration serves the public. The opposition says that the range of political views expressed is greatly narrowed and that local concerns are neglected, including local emergencies, for which communication is critical.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} [[Automation]] has resulted in many stations broadcasting for many hours a day with no one on the station premises.

== History ==
When radio first became popular, it was not used as a source of information; rather, people listened to the radio solely for entertainment purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/edward-r-murrow-inventing-broadcast-journalism.htm|title=Edward R. Murrow: Inventing Broadcast Journalism|last=|first=|date=|website=www.historynet.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This began to change with a man named [[Edward R. Murrow]]. Edward Murrow was an American who traveled to England in order to broadcast news about [[World War II]]. He stayed in London throughout the war and was the first to report on events such as bombings in [[London]] and updated the people on Hitler's reign. Murrow gained his fame mainly after reporting on [[Hitler]]'s German army annexing Austria. Many Americans relied on his broadcasts throughout the war to gain information about the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.journalism.ku.edu/1930/1930.shtml|title=History of Broadcast Journalism|last=|first=|date=|website=history.journalism.ku.edu|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More people also began to rely on radio for information after the attacks on [[Pearl Harbor]]. People found out about the bombing through President Roosevelt's broadcast interrupting their daily programming. It set Americans on edge, and people began to rely more heavily on the radio for major announcements throughout World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modestoradiomuseum.org/radio%20reports%20pearl.html|title=Radio Reports Japan's Attack on Pearl Harbor|last=Pinheiro|first=Bob|website=www.modestoradiomuseum.org|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; World War II was a time where radio broadcasting became a much larger industry because it was the easiest and quickest way for people to get updates on what was going on throughout the world.

Informative radio continued while television reporting also began to take flight. Throughout the 40's and 50's television news sources grew, but radio still dominated. It wasn't until [[John F. Kennedy]]'s assassination in 1963 that television newscasting took off. Radio could only capture the sound of the event, but television showed people the true horror of the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/how-media-outlets-cover-news-2315249|title=12 Events that Triggered Media Coverage Evolution|newspaper=The Balance|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first major events in which news companies competed with each other to get the news out to the public first. [[CBS News]] was the first to report that Kennedy had been shot and was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/11/14/how-john-f-kennedy-assassination-changed-television-forever|title=How John F. Kennedy's Assassination Changed Television Forever|last=Sneed|first=Tierney|date=November 14, 2013|website=USNews.com|publisher=|access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; News crews spent the next several days covering everything happening in Washington, including Kennedy's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-jfk-media-idUSBRE9AK11N20131121|title=How the JFK assassination transformed media coverage|date=2016-11-21|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set the standard for news stations to have to cover major events quicker and get them out to the public as they were happening. The JFK assassination helped to transform television journalism to how it is today, with instantaneous coverage and live coverages at major events. Television offered faster coverage than radio and allowed viewers to feel more as if they were experiencing the event because they could visualize exactly what was going on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/television-in-the-United-States/The-year-of-transition-1959#toc283615|title=Television in the United States - The year of transition: 1959|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC (National Broadcasting Company) and CBS (Columbia Broadcasting System) were the two competing forces of news broadcasting in the early years of broadcast journalism. NBC was established in 1926 and CBS  in 1927. There was a divide in the industry because they were not only competing against each other, but radio news that had already been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NBC: America’s Network|last1=Hilmes|first1=Michele|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520250819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women had a hard time immersing themselves into radio news seeing as most of the radio broadcasts were men. There was a small amount of women who hosted programs that were for homemakers and were on entertainment broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hard news: women in broadcast journalism|last1=Hosley|first1=David|date=1987|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780313254772|location=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the doors for women in broadcasting opened up. This was also due to the shortage of men that were home during the war, so news outlets looked to women to fill those gaps of times.  In the 1960s and 1970s larger numbers of women began to enter into broadcast news field.

Both radio and television are major sources for broadcast journalism today, even with rapidly expanding technology. Television still focuses on covering major events, but radio broadcasts focus more on analyzing stories rather than reporting breaking news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imdigitaljournalism.wordpress.com/journalism-then-and-now/|title=Journalism Then and Now|date=2011-11-06|newspaper=Digital Journalism|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internet often beats out broadcast journalism in terms of reporting breaking news, and the field of broadcast journalism is constantly having to adapt to the changing technology of today.

==Television==
Television (TV) news is considered by many to be the most influential medium for journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wecommunication.blogspot.com/2012/03/television-journalism.html|title=Television Journalism|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the American public, local news and national TV [[newscast]]s are the primary news sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalism.org/2016/07/07/pathways-to-news/|title=1. Pathways to news|date=2016-07-07|work=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only the numbers of audience viewers, but the effect on each viewer is considered more persuasive ("[[Understanding Media|The medium is the message]]").&lt;ref name="MacLuhan1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall MacLuhan|title=Understanding media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qwsXkmjEWUC|year=1995|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-63159-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television is dominated by attractive visuals (including beauty, action, and shock), with short soundbites and fast "cuts" (changes of [[camera angle]]). Television viewing numbers have become fragmented, with the  introduction of [[United States cable news|cable news]] channels, such as [[Cable News Network]] (CNN), [[Fox News Channel]] and [[MSNBC]].

===Local television===
The industry divides [[List of television stations in North America by media market|local television]] in North America into media markets. These television markets are defined by viewing area and are ranked by the number of audience viewers. New broadcast journalists generally start in the smaller markets with fewer viewers and move up to larger television stations and television networks after gaining experience. The larger stations usually have more resources and better pay.

United States stations typically broadcast local news three or four times a day: around 4:30–6 am, 11:30 or noon, 5 or 6 pm, and 10 or 11 at night. Most of the nightly local newscasts are 30 minutes, and include sports television and weather. News anchors are shown sitting at a desk in a television studio. The news anchors read [[teleprompter]]s that contain local interest stories and breaking news. Reporters frequently tell their stories outside the formal television studio in the field, in a [[remote broadcast]] setting where [[Electronic news-gathering]] (ENG) techniques are used with production trucks. Daytime television or morning shows include more "soft" news and feature pieces, while the evening news emphasizes "hard" news.

====News jobs====
News anchors (formerly "anchormen") serve as masters-of-ceremonies and are usually shown facing a [[professional video camera]] in a television studio while reading unseen teleprompters. The anchors are often in pairs (co-anchors), who sit side by side and often alternate their reading.  Meteorologists stand in front of chroma key backgrounds to describe weather forecasting and show maps, charts and pictures. [[Reporters]] research and write the stories and sometimes use video editing to prepare the story for air into a "package". Reporters are usually engaged in [[electronic field production]] (EFP) and are accompanied by a videographer at the scenes of the news; the latter holds the camera. The videographer or assistants manage the audio and lighting; they are in charge of setting up live television shots and might edit using a [[non-linear editing system]] (NLE). Segment producers choose, research and write stories, as well as deciding the timing and arrangement of the newscast. Associate producer, if any, specialize in other elements of the show such as graphics.

====Production jobs====
{{main article|Television crew}}
A newscast director is in charge of television show preparation, including assigning camera and talent (cast) positions on the set, as well as selecting the camera shots and other elements for either recorded or [[live television]] video production. The technical director (TD) operates the video switcher, which controls and mixes all the elements of the show. At smaller stations, the Director and Technical Director are the same person.

A graphics operator operates a character generator (CG) that produces the [[lower third]] on-screen titles and full-page digital on-screen graphics. The audio technician operates the audio mixing console. The technician is in charge of the microphones, music and audio tape. Often, production assistants operate the teleprompters and professional video cameras and serve as lighting and rigging technicians ([[Grip (job)|grips]]).

==== Business Changes ====
Broadcast journalism is changing rapidly, causing issues within the business as well. Many people can no longer find jobs in broadcast journalism because much more is online and does not even need to be broadcast by a person. Others are being laid off to invest more money into new technologies. Other changes include innovations allowing TV stations to better alert viewers in emergencies and have higher quality services. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nab.org/advocacy/televisionIssues.asp|title=Television Legislative and Regulatory Issues {{!}} Advocacy {{!}} National Association of Broadcasters|website=www.nab.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online convergence==
Convergence is the sharing and cross-promoting of content from a variety of media, all of which, in theory, converge and become one medium. In broadcast news, the internet is a key to convergence. Frequently, broadcast journalists also write text stories for the Web, usually accompanied by the graphics and sound of the original story. Websites offer the audience an interactive form where they can learn more about a story, can be referred to related articles, can offer comments for publication and can print stories at home. [[Technological convergence]] also lets newsrooms collaborate with other media, broadcast outlets sometimes have partnerships with their print counterparts. 

== Citizen broadcast journalism ==
Citizen broadcast journalism is a new form of technology that has allowed regular civilians to post stories they see through outlets such as [[Snapchat]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]]. It has become a new trend that some allegedly fear will take over broadcast journalism as it is known. News companies, like Fox News, are employing citizen journalists, which is a new phenomenon among journalism. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2016/03/09/citizen-journalists-are-about-to-take-over-newsrooms/|title=Citizen journalists are about to take over newsrooms|date=2016-03-09|work=New York Post|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[fake news]]" or [[Yellow journalism]] has taken over broadcast journalism throughout the past and current years. Its impact on broadcast journalism played a role in how news about the election was spread.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/resources/publications/ethics-in-the-news/fake-news|title=Ethics in the News - Fake News and Facts in the Post-Truth Era|work=Ethical Journalism Network|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fake news defines how viewers see news that may be misleading or false. The main aim of Yellow Journalism is to gather the attention of people in the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yellow Journalism|url=https://medium.com/@nimcjahmedabad/what-is-yellow-journalism-and-what-are-the-effects-of-yellow-journalism-55ed0824ecd3|website=Medium|accessdate=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these false or misleading stories came out during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]] between [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="781">'''Caption''' was a term used (especially in Scotland), for arrest or apprehension.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Caption}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caption also has an old legal use, to signify the part of an indictment, etc., which shows where, when and by what authority it is taken, found or executed; so its opening or heading. From this is derived the modern sense of the heading of an article in a book or newspaper.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In accordance with the American Heritage Dictionary, the word is still used in the United States to indicate: "the heading of a pleading or other document that identifies the parties, court, term, and number of the action."&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|Caption}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Norris completed his PhD in English at [[University College London]] in 1975.

'''Clinton Heylin''' (born 8 April 1960) is an English author who has written extensively about [[popular music]] and the work of [[Bob Dylan]].

== Education ==
Heylin attended [[Manchester Grammar School]]. He read history at [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College, University of London]], followed by an MA in history at the [[University of Sussex]].

== Work ==
Heylin has written extensively on the life and work of Bob Dylan, combining interviews with discographical research. His full-length biography ''Dylan: Behind the Shades'' (1991) was republished in a revised second edition as ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades – Take Two'' (UK edition, 2000) and ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'' (US edition, 2001).

Heylin published a detailed analysis of every song by Dylan in two volumes: ''Revolution in the Air: The Songs of Bob Dylan: Vol. 1: 1957–73'' (2009) and ''Still on the Road: The Songs of Bob Dylan: Vol. 2: 1974–2008'' (2010). These books analyse 610 songs written by Dylan, devoting a numbered section to each song. In 2011, to mark Dylan's 70th birthday, Heylin published ''Behind the Shades: The 20th Anniversary Edition'', which contained 60,000 words of new material to cover Dylan's work since 2000.

He has also written biographies on [[Van Morrison]] and [[Sandy Denny]]. He received favourable reviews for his studies of [[Orson Welles]], ''Despite the System: Orson Welles versus the Hollywood Studios'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2012, Heylin published a book about the theme of mental illness in British rock music in the 1960s and 1970s. Titled ''All the Madmen'', it includes chapters on the [[Dialectics of Liberation Congress|Dialectics of Liberation]] conference of 1967, [[Syd Barrett]], [[Pink Floyd]]'s album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', [[David Bowie]]'s theme of [[schizophrenia]] in his songs, [[the Who]]'s ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' album, and [[Nick Drake]].

Also in 2012, Heylin published ''E Street Shuffle: The Glory Days of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band'', a biography of [[Bruce Springsteen]] and an analysis of his achievements in the recording studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/e-street-shuffle-glory-days-bruce-springsteen-and-e-street-band| title = E Street Shuffle: The Glory Days of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band| author = Mark, Amanda| date = January 3, 2013| accessdate = March 11, 2014| work = New York Journal of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Heylin published ''It's One for the Money'', a history of song publishing since the birth of the popular music industry and the establishment of song copyrights at the beginning of the twentieth century.

In 2016, Heylin published his history of UK [[Punk rock|punk music]] in the year 1976, ''Anarchy in the Year Zero: The Sex Pistols, the Clash and the Class of '76''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://louderthanwar.com/anarchy-year-zero-clinton-heylin-book-review/| title = Anarchy In The Year Zero: Clinton Heylin: book review| author = Robb, John| date = June 8, 2016| accessdate = June 30, 2016| publisher = louderthanwar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 2016, Heylin published his study of Bob Dylan's [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|1966 World Tour]], ''Judas!: From Forest Hills to the Free Trade Hall: A Historical View of Dylan's Big Boo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.drb.ie/essays/they-re-selling-postcards-of-the-stoning| title = They're Selling Postcards of the Stoning| publisher = Dublin Review of Books
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heylin has also contributed the liner notes for the 36-CD set, ''Bob Dylan: The 1966 Live Recordings'', released by [[Legacy Recordings|Sony/Legacy Recordings]], which includes every known recording of Dylan’s 1966 concert tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://bobdylan.com/news/bob-dylan-1966-live-recordings-released-november/| title = “Bob Dylan: The 1966 Live Recordings” to be Released in November| date = September 27, 2016| accessdate = September 28, 2016| publisher = bobdylan.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Heylin published his account of Dylan's controversial "Born Again" Christian phase, ''Trouble In Mind: Bob Dylan's Gospel Years: What Really Happened''. The book complemented the release of ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 13: Trouble No More 1979–1981]]'', which consisted of a large number of out-takes and live performances from this period of Dylan's recording and performance career.

"'''Darmok'''" is the 102nd episode of the American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', the second episode of the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 5)|fifth season]]. The episode features [[Paul Winfield]], who previously played Captain Terrell in ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', and [[Ashley Judd]] in her debut acting performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Koltnow |first =  Barry |title = Ashley Judd Has Beauty, Brains And A Down-To-Earth Attitude |work = Orange County Register |location = Santa Ana, CA |date = April 5, 2002 |via =Newspaper Source Plus &lt;!--|access-date =  May 30, 2013--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Creative |work = The Official Website of Ashley Judd |access-date = May 2, 2015 |url = http://ashleyjudd.com/films/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes an incident in which the crew of the ''Enterprise'' is unable to establish meaningful communication with the crew of an alien vessel, which is resolved by the struggle of the ships' captains to defend each other from a vicious beast. It is often cited as one of the best episodes of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.startrek.com/article/one-trek-mind-deciphering-darmok |title = One Trek Mind: Deciphering 'Darmok' |access-date = August 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.wired.com/2012/10/star-trek-tng-readers-best-worst/ |title = Best Star Trek: The Next Generation Episodes, According to You |last = Thill |first = Scott |language = en-US |access-date = August 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The senior crew discuss their latest mission: to make contact with the Tamarian race who have been transmitting signals toward [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] space for weeks. They mention that several prior contacts have occurred, but no meaningful interaction has ever been achieved because the way the Tamarians communicate could not be understood. The ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]'' makes contact with a Tamarian ship in orbit around the planet El-Adrel. Though the universal translator can translate their words, the Tamarians communicate only through [[allegory]], which baffles the ''Enterprise'' crew because they do not understand this yet nor do they even know the stories to which the Tamarians are referring. Likewise, the Tamarians seem equally baffled by and unable to understand Picard's straightforward use of language.

Frustrated by their failure at communication, the Tamarian captain, Dathon, has himself and [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]] [[transporter (Star Trek)|transported]] to the planet's surface. The Tamarians then create a scattering field in the planetary atmosphere to prevent transport functions from being used on either captain. On the surface, Dathon utters the phrase "Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra" and tosses Picard a dagger. Picard is unsure if this is some kind of formal challenge to a duel and so tosses it back to Dathon. As night falls, Picard fails to make a fire and Captain Dathon shares his fire with the phrase "Temba, his arms wide." The next morning, Dathon comes running and Picard realizes that there is also a hostile predator in the area that is stalking them both. Picard finally begins to understand the way the Tamarians communicate when he recites one of the allegories and sees the meaning underneath it: it is a direction on the tactic Dathon wants to use to fight the beast.

The two attempt to fight the beast together, but because of the Enterprise's ultimately unsuccessful transporter attempt to rescue Picard mid-battle prevents him from participating at a crucial moment, Dathon is severely wounded.

On the ''Enterprise'', First Officer [[William Riker|Riker]] and the crew struggle to understand the aliens' language and Riker has Commander [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] work with ship's counselor [[Deanna Troi|Troi]] in hopes of translating it. Lt. [[Worf]], in the meantime, thinks that the Captain is being tested as a warrior and advocates an aggressive stance, which Riker says he will take as a last option. Riker has Worf take a [[shuttlecraft (Star Trek)|shuttlecraft]] to try to retrieve the Captain, which fails when the aliens precisely disable the craft and force it to return to the ''Enterprise''. Chief Engineer [[Geordi La Forge|La Forge]] and Worf work on a way to disable the Tamarians' scattering field to beam up Picard, while Troi and Data work on deciphering the Tamarian language. They deduce that it is entirely based on allegories from Tamarian folklore. They learn that Darmok was a hunter and Tanagra is an island but nothing else. Without the stories behind the allegories, the Tamarian language remains indecipherable.

While tending to Dathon's wounds, Picard keeps him talking and slowly deduces that Darmok and Jalad were two warriors who met on an island called Tanagra and had to cooperate to defeat a dangerous beast dwelling there, becoming friends in the process. Dathon tried to recreate this event between himself and Picard on El-Adrel, hoping that their shared adversity would forge a friendship where words had failed. Picard recounts for Dathon the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', a human story that parallels the allegory of Darmok and Jalad. Dathon seems to understand and appreciate the story but eventually succumbs to his wounds.

The ''Enterprise'' fires on the Tamarian ship, disabling the scattering field, and beams up Picard. He uses his newfound knowledge of Tamarian allegories to communicate a basic message to the Tamarians and end the battle; when Picard returns Dathon's personal journal to them, the Tamarians record announce the story as "Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel" and add a new phrase to their language. Picard mourns Dathon, who sacrificed his life to open relations between their two cultures.

Picard later reads the [[Homeric Hymns]] in his ready room, explaining to Riker that more familiarity with their own mythology may help them to relate to the Tamarians. Picard notes to Riker that Dathon sacrificed his life in hope of communication and wonders if he would have been willing to do the same.

After Riker leaves the ready room, Picard picks up the knife and looks out of the ready room window into space while he repeats the seemingly ritualistic gestures that he saw Dathon engage in. Picard thus pays silent tribute to his fallen comrade.

==Production==
This episode had the longest gestation period of any episode of ''TNG'' during Michael Piller's tenure, taking around two years to make it to the screen. Rick Berman hated the premise, but Piller thought it was interesting and was determined to make it work. Piller gave it to Joe Menosky, who completed the script and focused the story on the idea of two leaders attempting to communicate, as well as using the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' as a plot device.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages |last = Gross |first = Edward |publisher = Little Brown &amp; Co. |year =  1995 |isbn = 0316329576 |location =  |pages =  |last2 = Altman |first2 = Mark A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary filming for "Darmok" occurred July 18−26, 1991, on Paramount Stages 8, 9, and 16, as well as on location at [[Bronson Canyon]]. An additional day was August 8 for the blue screen unit to film the creature scenes with stuntman Rex Pierson on Paramount Stage 9. [[Second unit]] for this episode filmed on August 26 on Paramount Stages 9 and 16. When production for the following episode, "[[Ensign Ro (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Ensign Ro]]", returned to location at Bronson Canyon on August 5, another sequence was filmed for "Darmok" involving Rex Pierson and photo doubles Ron Large and Lanier Edwards. Photo double Dana Vitatoe filmed additional second unit shots on August 28 on Paramount Stage 9. The call sheet dated on July 18 featured an "uncast actress" in the role of Lt. Larson; in the final episode, this role became Robin Lefler, who was played by [[Ashley Judd]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Dosing''' generally applies to feeding [[chemical]]s or [[medicine]]s when used in small quantities.

For medicines the term ''[[dose (biochemistry)|dose]]'' is generally used. In the case of inanimate objects the word dosing is typical. The term '''dose titration''', referring to stepwise [[titration|adjustment]] of doses until a desired level of effect is reached, is common in [[medicine]].

==Engineering==
The word ''dosing'' is very commonly used by [[engineer]]s in thermal [[power stations]], in water treatment, in any industry where [[steam]] is being generated, and in [[building services]] for heating and cooling water treatment. Dosing procedures are also in vogue in [[textile]] and similar industries where chemical treatment is involved.

Commercial [[Swimming pool sanitation#Systems and disinfection methods|swimming pool]]s also require chemical dosing in order to control [[pH]] balance, [[chlorine]] level, and other such water quality criteria. Modern swimming pool plant will have bulk storage of chemicals held in separate '''dosing tanks''', and will have automated controls and '''dosing pumps''' to top up the various chemicals as required to control the water quality.

In a power station treatment chemicals are injected or fed to [[boiler]] and also to feed and make up water under [[pressure]], but in small dosages or rate of [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]. The feeding at all places is done by means of small capacity dosing [[pump]]s specially designed for the duty demanded.

In building services the water quality of various pumped fluid systems, including for heating, cooling, and condensate water, will be regularly checked and topped up with chemicals manually as required to suit the required water quality. Most commonly [[Corrosion inhibitor|inhibitor]]s will be added to protect the pipework and components against corrosion, or a [[biocide]] will be added to stop the growth of bacteria in lower temperature systems. The required chemicals will be added to the fluid system by use of a '''dosing pot'''; a multi-valved chamber in which the chemical can be added, and then introduced to the fluid system in a controlled manner.

In food industries, the dosing of ingredients is particularly important in order to ensure the quality of the recipe as well as its food safety where the consumers' health may be directly implicated. Dosing is done in wet processes with dosing pumps but even more importantly in dry processes, just prior to the packaging of the product. Dosing of dry materials is commonly done through Gain-in-Weight dosing or Loss-in-Weight dosing using equipments on load cells.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.powderprocess.net/Dosing.html Source on dosing principles for dry ingredients&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture==
The feeding of chemicals in [[agriculture]] has also become common due to technology developments. However agricultural dosing is done by means of hand held pressure spray pumps.

===Aerial spraying===
Sometimes aerial spraying of chemicals by fixed quantities at intervals or dosing is also adopted for agricultural spraying or for atmospheric spraying for eliminating certain types of harmful [[insect]]s.

'''Enrique of Malacca''' ({{lang-es|Enrique de Malaca}}; {{lang-pt|Henrique de Malaca}}; Malay known as Panglima Awang), who participated in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[explorer]] [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s mission in the 16th century to sail around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/printheritage/detail/dd3d97ec-0018-4bd1-9e23-8270477e2d16.aspx|title=Purbawara Panglima Awang - BookSG - National Library Board, Singapore|last=Singapore|first=National Library Board,|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bharian.com.my/node/55556 &lt;/ref&gt; [[Italy|Italian]] historian [[Antonio Pigafetta]], who wrote the most comprehensive account of Magellan's voyage, named him "Henrique" (which was [[Spanish language|Hispanicised]] as ''Enrique'' in official Spanish documents). Pigafetta explicitly states that "Henrique" was a native of [[Sumatra]]. According to biographer-philosopher [[Stefan Zweig]],  he is the first person to circumnavigate the world.&lt;ref name=zweig&gt;1938   ''Magellan. Der Mann und seine Tat'',  {{ISBN|4-87187-856-2}}, pp. 213-214&lt;/ref&gt; His name appears as "Henrique",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/coleccibonviages04navarich|title=Martín Fernández de Navarrete|work=Page 14|accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and is probably the name given to him at his [[baptism|christening]], as he was baptised a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] by his Portuguese captors. His name appears only in Pigafetta's account, in Magellan's [[Will (law)|Last Will]], and in official documents at the ''Casa de Contratación de las Indias'' of the Magellan expedition to the [[Philippines]].

As set out in Magellan's document Last Will, Magellan acquired Enrique as a slave at [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], most probably at the early stages of the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|siege by the Portuguese]] in 1511, at age 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Smiler Levinson, ''Magellan and the First Voyage Around the World'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2001).  ISBN: 0395987733, 9780395987735.. His Christian name, ''Henrique'', may indicate that his capture was on 13 July, the feast-day of [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|St Henry]], which was several days from the start of the siege of Malacca by the Portuguese under the leadership of [[Afonso de Albuquerque]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrique's baptism is attested by Magellan himself in his will, in which he states that Enrique was a Christian. Magellan also explicitly mentions that Enrique was a native of Malacca. Eyewitness documents of Antonio Pigafetta, [[Ginés de Mafra]], the [[Genoa|Genoese]] pilot, [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]], [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], and [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], and secondary sources such as [[João de Barros]] and [[Francisco López de Gómara]], refer to him as a slave.

== Magellan expedition ==
Enrique accompanied Magellan back to [[Europe]], and onwards on Magellan's search for a westward passage to the [[East Indies]], and he served as an [[interpreter]] for the Spaniards. Bergreen 2002 cites Magellan's claim to the Spanish court that his slave Enrique was a native of the Spice Islands; Magellan produced letters from a Portuguese acquaintance, [[Francisco Serrão]], who located the Spice Islands so far to the east of Spain, that they lay in the area granted to Spain, rather than Portugal; in other words, the Earth was round. This gave Spain an opportunity to claim the Spice Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bergreen|2002}}{{rp|pp.30-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ginés de Mafra explicitly states in his first hand account that Enrique was taken on the expedition primarily because of his ability to speak the [[Malay language]]: "He [Magellan] told his men that they were now in the land he had desired, and sent a man named Herédia, who was the ship's clerk, ashore with a Native they had taken, so they said, because he was known to speak Malay, the language spoken in the [[Malay Archipelago]]." The island in the Philippines where Enrique spoke and was understood by the natives was [[Mazaua]], which Mafra locates somewhere near [[Mindanao]].

== After Magellan's death ==
Magellan had provided in his will that Enrique was to be freed upon his death. But after the battle, the remaining ships' masters refused this bequest. 

The Genoese pilot of the Magellan expedition, states&amp;nbsp;— wrongly&amp;nbsp;— in his eye-witness account that the Spaniards had no interpreter when they arrived back to [[Cebu]], because Enrique had died on [[Mactan]] along with Magellan during the [[Battle of Mactan]] in 1521. However, Enrique was very much alive on 1 May 1521, and attended a feast given by [[Rajah Humabon]] to the Spaniards. Antonio Pigafetta writes that the survivor [[João Serrão]], who was pleading with the crew from the shore to save him from the Cebuano tribesmen, said that all those who went to the banquet were slain, except for Enrique.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|title=The First Voyage Round the World by Magellan and other documents|last=Pigafetta |first=Antonio|editor=Lord Stanley of Alderley|year=1874| page=104|url=https://archive.org/stream/firstvoyageroun00pigagoog#page/n274/mode/2up}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A discourse by Giovanni Battista Ramusio claims that Enrique warned the Chief of Subuth that the Spaniards were plotting to capture the king and that this led to the murder of Serrão and others at the banquet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pigafetta|1874|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possibility of the first circumnavigation ==
Enrique accompanied Magellan on all his voyages, including the voyage that circumnavigated the world between 1519 and 1521. On 1 May he left in Cebu, with the presumed intention to return to his home island,&lt;ref name=zweig /&gt; and there is nothing more said of Enrique in any document.

If he succeeded in returning to his home, he would have been the first person to circumnavigate the world and return to his starting point.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Foster, The Magellan Project, [https://magellanproject.org/tag/enrique/ "Who Closed the Circle First?"], August 26th, 2015.  Accessed Sept. 25, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penélope V. Flores, [http://www.positivelyfilipino.com/magazine/magellans-interpreter-enrique-was-the-first-to-circumnavigate-the-world "Magellan’s Interpreter, Enrique, Was The First To Circumnavigate The World"], ''Positively Filipino.  Accessed Sept. 25, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Afaf Md Din, [https://historiafactory.wordpress.com/2016/06/20/enrique-de-malacca/Enrique de Malacca], Historiafactory, June 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The official and generally accepted view is that [[Juan_Sebastián_Elcano|Elcano]] and his sailors were the first, according to [[Maximilianus Transylvanus]] and [[Antonio Pigafetta]] documents. Enrique is only documented to have travelled with Magellan from Malacca to Cebu, 2500&amp;nbsp;km and 20 degrees of longitude short of completing the circumnavigation. It is not known if he ever had a chance to complete it.

'''Fibrosis''' is the formation of excess fibrous [[connective tissue]] in an organ or tissue in a reparative or reactive process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Type-1 pericytes accumulate after tissue injury and produce collagen in an organ-dependent manner|url = http://stemcellres.com/content/5/6/122/abstract|journal = Stem Cell Research &amp; Therapy|date = 2014-11-06|issn = 1757-6512|pmc = 4445991|pmid = 25376879|pages = 122|volume = 5|issue = 6|doi = 10.1186/scrt512|language = en|first = Alexander|last = Birbrair|first2 = Tan|last2 = Zhang|first3 = Daniel C.|last3 = Files|first4 = Sandeep|last4 = Mannava|first5 = Thomas|last5 = Smith|first6 = Zhong-Min|last6 = Wang|first7 = Maria L.|last7 = Messi|first8 = Akiva|last8 = Mintz|first9 = Osvaldo|last9 = Delbono}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be a reactive, benign, or pathological state. In response to injury, this is called [[scar]]ring, and if fibrosis arises from a single cell line, this is called a [[fibroma]]. Physiologically, fibrosis acts to deposit connective tissue, which can interfere with or totally inhibit the normal architecture and function of the underlying organ or tissue. Fibrosis can be used to describe the pathological state of excess deposition of fibrous tissue, as well as the process of connective tissue deposition in healing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dermnetnz.org/pathology/pathology-glossary.html Glossary of dermatopathological terms. DermNet NZ]&lt;/ref&gt; Defined by the pathological accumulation of [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) proteins, fibrosis results in scarring and thickening of the affected tissue, it is in essence an exaggerated wound healing response which interferes with normal organ function.&lt;ref name="pmid26435749"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neary R, Watson CJ, Baugh JA | title = Epigenetics and the overhealing wound: the role of DNA methylation in fibrosis | journal = Fibrogenesis &amp; Tissue Repair | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 18 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26435749 | pmc = 4591063 | doi = 10.1186/s13069-015-0035-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology==
Fibrosis is similar to the process of scarring, in that both involve stimulated [[fibroblast]]s laying down [[connective tissue]], including [[collagen]] and [[glycosaminoglycan]]s. The process is initiated when immune cells such as [[macrophage]]s release soluble factors that stimulate fibroblasts.  The most well characterized pro-fibrotic mediator is [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF beta]], which is released by macrophages as well as any damaged tissue between surfaces called [[Interstitial fluid|interstitium]].   Other soluble mediators of fibrosis include [[CTGF]], [[platelet-derived growth factor]] (PDGF), and [[Interleukin 4]] (IL-4). These initiate signal transduction pathways such as the AKT/mTOR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mitra A, Luna JI, Marusina AI, Merleev A, Kundu-Raychaudhuri S, Fiorentino D, Raychaudhuri SP, Maverakis E | title = Dual mTOR Inhibition Is Required to Prevent TGF-β-Mediated Fibrosis: Implications for Scleroderma. | journal = J Invest Dermatol | volume = 135 | issue = 11 | pages = 2873–6 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26134944 | doi = 10.1038/jid.2015.252 | pmc=4640976}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SMAD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leask A, Abraham DJ | title = TGF-beta signaling and the fibrotic response | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 816–827 | year = 2004| pmid = 15117886 | doi = 10.1096/fj.03-1273rev}}&lt;/ref&gt;  pathways that ultimately lead to the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts, which deposit extracellular matrix into the surrounding connective tissue.  This process of tissue repair is a complex one, with tight regulation of ECM synthesis and degradation ensuring maintenance of normal tissue architecture. However, the entire process, although necessary,  can lead to a progressive irreversible fibrotic response if tissue injury is severe or repetitive, or if the wound healing response itself becomes deregulated.&lt;ref name="pmid26435749"/&gt;

'''Gaon''' (gā'ōn) ({{lang-he-n|גאון}}, plural {{hebrew|גְּאוֹנִים}} ''geonim'' — gĕ'ōnīm) may have originated as a shortened version of "Rosh Yeshivat Ge'on Ya'akov", though there are alternative explanations.&lt;ref name='EJOnlineP380'&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author = Jehoshua Brand , Simha Assaf and David Derovan | editor = [[Michael Berenbaum]] and [[Fred Skolnik]] | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Judaica]] | title = Gaon | edition = 2nd  | year = 2007 | publisher = [[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] | volume = 7 | location = Farmington Hills, Michigan | page = 380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07062.html Jewish Virtual Library — Gaon]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Biblical Hebrew|Ancient Hebrew]], it referred to arrogance and haughty pride (Amos 6:8 - "I abhor the pride of Jacob and detest his fortresses; I will deliver up the city and everything in it.") and later became known as a general term for pride, both the positive and negative forms ('Pride [of]'; Late medieval and modern Hebrew for 'genius'). Today, it may refer to:

* One of the [[Geonim]], that is to say the heads of the two major academies, at [[Pumbedita]] and [[Sura (city)|Sura]], and later in Baghdad, during the period  589-1040. Prominent Geonim include:

'''Handy billy''' — also known as Handy-billie —is an emergency portable [[pump]] that for decades was commonly placed aboard most [[U.S. Navy]] ships from [[World War I]] on, as well as later use on civilian craft.

== Purpose of the pump ==

The ''handy billy'', formally designated "P50", because it pumped 50 gallons per minute, was [[gasoline]]-powered and could be used, during flooding conditions, in conjunction with other pumps on the ship. However, it was especially valuable when the ship lost electrical power and normal pumping ability was lost.

On smaller ships, it was a critical piece of equipment.

The pump gained its name because it was very “handy” and dependable. It was especially handy because it could be easily transported from place to place by two strong crew members, one at each end, as it weighed 160 pounds during World War II.

== Versatility ==

The handy billy could be used for fire-fighting and/or pumping water from flooded spaces aboard ship.

== Example of use ==

'''Information and media literacy''' ('''IML''') enables people to interpret and make informed judgments as users of information and media, as well as to become skillful creators and producers of information and media messages in their own right.&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"/&gt;

Prior to the 1990s, the primary focus of [[information literacy]] was research skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Information_Literacy |accessdate=July 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422143339/http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Information_Literacy |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media literacy]], a study that emerged around the 1970s, traditionally focuses on the analysis and the delivery of information through various forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medialit.org/about_cml.html |title=About CML &amp;#124; Center for Media Literacy |publisher=Medialit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825191946/http://www.medialit.org/about_cml.html |archivedate=2010-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the study of information literacy has been extended to include the study of media literacy in many countries like the UK,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730105014/http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions.aspx |date=July 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anziil.org/resources/Info%20lit%202nd%20edition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530015206/http://www.anziil.org/resources/Info%20lit%202nd%20edition.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "information and media literacy" is used by [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15886&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Media and Information Literacy |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to differentiate the combined study from the existing study of information literacy. It is also referred to as information and communication technologies ([[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]) in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infolit.org/definitions.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711210412/http://www.infolit.org/definitions.html |date=July 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ets.org/Media/Research/pdf/ICTREPORT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Educators such as [[Gregory Ulmer]] have also defined the field as [[electracy]].

IML is a combination of information literacy and media literacy. The purpose of being information and media literate is to engage in a digital society; one needs to be able to understand, inquire, create, communicate and think critically. It is important to effectively access, organize, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204091732/http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx |date=February 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformative nature of IML includes creative works and creating new knowledge; to publish and collaborate responsibly requires ethical, cultural and social understanding.

==21st-century students==
The IML learning capacities prepare students to be 21st century literate.  According to Jeff Wilhelm (2000), "technology has everything to do with literacy. And being able to use the latest electronic technologies has everything to do with being literate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachnet-lab.org/fklane/wilhelm.htm Literacy by Design:  Why is all This Technology so Important?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034957/http://www.teachnet-lab.org/fklane/wilhelm.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports his argument with J. David Bolter's statement that "if our students are not reading and composing with various electronic technologies, then they are illiterate. They are not just unprepared for the future; they are illiterate right now, in our current time and context".&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilhelm's statement is supported by the 2005 Wired World Phase II (YCWW II) survey conducted by the Media Awareness Network of Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca |title=MediaSmarts |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 5000 Grade 4 – 11 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/research/YCWW/phaseII/key_findings.cfm |title=MediaSmarts |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425195852/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/research/YCWW/phaseII/key_findings.cfm |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The key findings of the survey were:
*62% of Grade 4 students prefer the [[Internet]].
*38% of Grade 4 students prefer the library.
*91% of Grade 11 students prefer the Internet.
*9% of Grade 11 students prefer the library.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005a, para. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Prensky (2001) uses the term "[[digital native]]" to describe people who have been brought up in a digital world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20Digital%20Natives,%20Digital%20Immigrants%20-%20Part1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet has been a pervasive element of young people's home lives. 94% of kids reported that they had Internet access at home, and a significant majority (61%) had a high-speed connection.

By the time kids reach Grade 11, half of them (51 percent) have their own Internet-connected computer, separate and apart from the family computer.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; The survey also showed that young Canadians are now among the most wired in the world. Contrary to the earlier stereotype of the isolated and awkward computer nerd, today's wired kid is a social kid.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, many students are better networked through the use of technology than most teachers and parents, who may not understand the abilities of technology. Students are no longer limited to desktop computera. They may use mobile technologies to graph mathematical problems, research a question for social studies, text message an expert for information, or send homework to a drop box.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.wmich.edu/~b4poppen/IPhoneArticle3.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are accessing information by using [[MSN]], personal Web pages, [[Weblog]]s and [[social network service|social networking sites]].

== Teaching and learning in the 21st century ==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2018|section}}
Many teachers continue the tradition of teaching of the past 50 years. Traditionally teachers have been the experts sharing their knowledge with children. Technology, and the learning tools it provides access to, forces us to change to being facilitators of learning.  We have to change the stereotype of teacher as the expert who delivers information, and students as consumers of information, in order to meet the needs of digital students. Teachers not only need to learn to speak digital, but also to embrace the language of digital natives.

Language is generally defined as a system used to communicate in which symbols convey information.  Digital natives can communicate fluently with digital devices and convey information in a way that was impossible without digital devices. People born prior to 1988 are sometimes referred to as "digital immigrants."  They experience difficulty programming simple devices like a VCR.  Digital immigrants do not start pushing buttons to make things work.

Learning a language is best done early in a child's development.

In acquiring a second language, Hyltenstam (1992) found that around the age of 6 and 7 seemed to be a cut-off point for bilinguals to achieve native-like proficiency.  After that age, second language learners could get near-native-like-ness but their language would, while consisting of very few actual errors, have enough errors that would set them apart from the first language group.

Kindergarten and grades 1 and 2 are critical to student success as digital natives because not all students have a "digital"-rich childhood.  Students learning technological skills before Grade 3 can become equivalently bilingual. "Language-minority students who cannot read and write proficiently in English cannot participate fully in American schools, workplaces, or society. They face limited job opportunities and earning power." Speaking "digital" is as important as being literate in order to participate fully in North American society and opportunities.

==Students' struggle==
Many students are considered illiterate in media and information for various reasons. They may not see the value of media and information literacy in the 21st-century classroom.  Others are not aware of the emergence of the new form of information.  Educators need to introduce IML to these students to help them become media and information literate.  Very little changes will be made if the educators are not supporting information and media literacy in their own classrooms.

Performance standards, the foundation to support them, and tools to implement them are readily available.  Success will come when there is full implementation and equitable access are established.  Shared vision and goals that focus on strategic actions with measurable results are also necessary.

When the staff and community, working together, identify and clarify their values, beliefs, assumptions, and perceptions about what they want children to know and be able to do, an important next step will be to discover which of these values and expectations will be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; Using the capacity tools to assess IML will allow students, staff and the community to reflect on how well students are meeting learning needs as related to technology.

The IML Performance standards allow data collection and analysis to evidence that student-learning needs are being met.  After assessing student IML, three questions can be asked:

* What does each student need to learn?
* How does one know whether students have met the capacities?
* How does one respond when students have difficulty in learning?

Teachers can use classroom assessment for learning to identify areas that might need increased focus and support.  Students can use classroom assessment to set learning goals for themselves.

==In the curriculum==
This integration of technology across the [[curriculum]] is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as [[technical communication tools]].  In addition, recent learning [[pedagogy]] recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology. [[International Society for Technology in Education]] (ISTE)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=About_ISTE&lt;/ref&gt; has been developing a standard IML curriculum for the US and other countries by implementing the [[National Educational Technology Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nets-implementation.iste.wikispaces.net/ |title=NETS Implementation - home |publisher=Nets-implementation.iste.wikispaces.net |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2013-07-28 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
In the UK, IML has been promoted among educators through an information literacy website&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; developed by several organizations that have been involved in the field.

===US===
IML is included in the Partnership for the 21st Century program sponsored by the US Department of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=254&amp;Itemid=120 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314140756/http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=254&amp;Itemid=120 |archivedate=2009-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special mandates have been provided to Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=505&amp;Itemid=189 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522125507/http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=505&amp;Itemid=189 |archivedate=2009-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual school districts, such as the Clarkstown Central School District,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccsd.edu/bardonia/CCSDLibraryCurriculum/hrdcpy/Final%20Draft1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913115949/http://www.ccsd.edu/bardonia/CCSDLibraryCurriculum/hrdcpy/Final%20Draft1.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have also developed their own information literacy curriculum. ISTE has also produced the National Educational Technology Standards for Students, Teachers and Administrators.

In [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], the Ministry of Education has de-listed the Information Technology K to 7 IRP &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/irp/resdocs/itk7.pdf Information Technology K to 7 IRP (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; as a stand-alone course.  It is still expected that all the prescribed learning outcomes continue to be integrated.

This integration of technology across the curriculum is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as [[technical communication tools]]. In addition, recent learning [[pedagogy]] recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology.  Unfortunately, there has been no clear direction to implement IML.

The BC Ministry of Education published the Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/perf_stands/icti/ Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;  These standards provide performance standards expectations for Grade 5 to 10; however, they do not provide guidance for other grades, and the expectation for a Grade 5 and Grade 10 student are the same.

===Arab World===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
In the Arab region, media and information literacy was largely ignored up until 2011, when the Media Studies Program at the American University of Beirut, the Open Society Foundations and the Arab-US Association for Communication Educators (AUSACE) launched a regional conference themed "New Directions: Digital and Media Literacy". The conference attracted significant attention from Arab universities and scholars, who discussed obstacles and needs to advance media literacy in the Arab region, including developing curricula in Arabic, training faculty and promoting the field. 

Following up on that recommendation, the Media Studies Program at AUB and the Open Society Foundations in collaboration with the Salzburg Academy on Media and Global Change launched in 2013 the first regional initiative to develop, vitalize, and advance media literacy education in the Arab region. The Media and Digital Literacy Academy of Beirut (MDLAB) offered an annual two-week summer training program in addition to working year-round to develop media literacy curricula and programs. The academy is conducted in Arabic and English and brings pioneering international instructors and professionals to teach advanced digital and media literacy concepts to young Arab academics and graduate students from various fields. MDLAB hopes that the participating Arab academics will carry what they learned to their countries and institutions and offers free curricular material in Arabic and English, including media literacy syllabi, lectures, exercises, lesson plans, and multi-media material, to assist and encourage the integration of digital and media literacy into Arab university and school curricula. 

In recognition of MDLAB's accomplishments in advancing media literacy education in the Arab region, the founder of MDLAB received the 2015 UNESCO-UNAOC International Media and Information Literacy Award. 

Prior to 2013, only two Arab universities offered media literacy courses: the American University of Beirut (AUB) and the American University of Sharjah (AUS). Three years after the launch of MDLAB, over two dozen Arab universities incorporated media literacy education into their curricula, both as stand-alone courses or as modules injected into their existing media courses. Among the universities who have full-fledged media literacy courses (as of 2015) are Lebanese American University (Lebanon), Birzeit University (Palestine), University of Balamand (Lebanon), Damascus University (Syria), Rafik Hariri University (Lebanon), Notre Dame University (Lebanon), Ahram Canadian University (Egypt), American University of Beirut (Lebanon), American University of Sharjah (UAE), and Al Azm University (Lebanon). The first Arab school to adopt media literacy as part of its strategic plan is the International College (IC) in Lebanon. Efforts to introduce media literacy to the region's other universities and schools continues with the help of other international organizations, such as UNESCO, UNAOC, AREACORE, DAAD, and OSF.

==Barriers==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2018|section}}
One barrier to learning to read is the lack of books, while a barrier to learning IML is the lack of technology access. Highlighting the value of IML helps to identify existing barriers within school infrastructure, staff development, and support systems.  While there is a continued need to work on the foundations to provide a sustainable and equitable access, the biggest obstacle is school climate.

Marc Prensky&lt;ref&gt;Marc Prensky 2006, para. 25&lt;/ref&gt; identifies one barrier as teachers viewing digital devices as distractions: "Let's admit the real reason that we ban cell phones is that, given the opportunity to use them, students would vote with their attention, just as adults would 'vote with their feet' by leaving the room when a presentation is not compelling."{{clarification needed|date=June 2018}}

The mindset of banning new technology, and fearing the bad things that can happen, can affect educational decisions. The decision to ban digital devices impacts students for the rest of their lives.

Any tool that is used poorly or incorrectly can be unsafe.  Safety lessons are mandatory in industrial technology and science.  Yet safety or ethical lessons are not mandatory to use technology.

Not all decisions in schools are measured by common ground beliefs.  One school district in Ontario banned digital devices from their schools.  Local schools have been looking at doing the same. These kinds of reactions are often about immediate actions and not about teaching, learning or creating solutions.  Many barriers to IML exist.

'''Iraqi Sign Language''' is the [[deaf sign language]] of [[Iraq]]. It appears to be close to [[Levantine Arabic Sign Language]] (Hendriks 2008).

The '''Kara languages''' are [[Tar Gula language|Tar Gula]] and possibly related [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic]] languages of the [[Central African Republic]]. The name ''Kara'' is used for numerous other peoples of the region, and so is often ambiguous. 

''Ethnologue'' 16 lists three Kara languages, [[Tar Gula language|Gula]], [[Furu language|Furu]] (Bagero), and [[Yulu language|Yulu]] (Yulu–Binga). However, of these, Blench (2012) accepts only Gula. He places Furu with the [[Kresh language|Kresh]] dialect cluster and Yulu as an isolate within [[Bongo–Bagirmi languages|Bongo–Bagirmi]]. Nonetheless, he retain the Kara branch, also with three languages: Gula, [[Kara of Birao]], and [[Kara language (Sudan)|Kara of Sudan]]. ''Ethnologue'' treats Kara (Sudan) as a synonym of Gula, being merely the Gula spoken across the border in Sudan. The Kara of Birao it leaves [[unclassified language|unclassified]]. However, it lists Fer ''(Dam Fer, Fertit)'' as synonyms; in Blench's and earlier classifications, [[Fer language|Fer]] is a [[Bagirmi languages|Bagirmi language]], and ''Ethnologue'' does not list a separate Fer language for CAR. Thus it is possible that the Kara branch is synonymous with the Gula language.

[[File:Kattakayam Cherian Mappilla statue @ Pala 01.jpg|thumb|Statue of Mappila at [[Pala, Kerala]].]]
'''Kattakayam Cherian Mappillai''' (1859–1936) was a [[Malayalam]] poet. His ''magnum opus'' is the epic poem ''Shreeyeshu Vijayam'', composed over a span of 15 years and finished in the year 1926, which earned him the title of Mahakavi. He was the Editor of ''[[Vijnaana Rathnaakaram]]'', one of the early literary magazines (started in 1913) in the Malayalam language. He also co-founded one of the earliest rubber trading companies in Kerala, called Meenachil Rubber Company. He hailed from the Kattakayam family of [[Palai]] in [[Kottayam District|Kottayam]], [[Kingdom of Travancore]].

In [[printing]], a '''key plate''' is the plate which prints the detail in an image.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster - Definition of key plate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/key%20plate|title=Definition of key plate|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When printing [[color image]]s by combining multiple colors of [[ink]]s, the colored inks usually do not contain much image detail. The key plate, which is usually impressed using black ink, provides the lines and/or contrast of the image. However, in two-color images where neither color was black, the key plate might have been printed in the darker of the two colors. Key plate is synonymous with ''keystone'' in the same context.

'''Kunza''' a.k.a. '''Cunza''', also known as '''Likanantaí''', '''Lipe''', '''Ulipe''', or '''Atacameño''', is an extinct [[language isolate]] once spoken in the [[Atacama Desert]] of northern [[Chile]] and southern [[Perú]] (specifically in Peine, [[Socaire]] ([[Salar de Atacama]]), and [[Caspana]]) by the [[Atacama people|Lickan-antay]] people, who have since shifted to [[Spanish people|Spanish]].

The last Kunza speaker was found in 1949, although some have been found since according to anthropologists.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} There are 2,000 [[Atacameño]]s (W. Adelaar).

Kaufman (1990) found a proposed connection between Kunza and the likewise unclassified [[Kanoê language|Kapixaná]] to be plausible; however, when that language was more fully described in 2004, it turned out to be an isolate.

Kunza contains a typical 5-vowel inventory: /a, e, i, o, u/. All vowels have long counterparts, and Kunza displays contrastive vowel length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~saphon|title=SAPhon – South American Phonological Inventories|website=linguistics.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bilingual (French-Dutch) signs in Brussels.jpg|thumb|Two [[bilingual signs]] (both in Dutch and French) on a street in Brussels]]
The [[Belgium|Kingdom of Belgium]] has three official languages: [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]]. A number of non-official, minority languages and dialects are spoken as well.

==Official languages==

===Legal status===
The [[Belgian Constitution|Belgium Constitution]] guarantees, since the country's independence, freedom of language in the private sphere. Article 30 specifies that "the use of languages spoken in Belgium is optional; only the law can rule on this matter, and only for acts of the public authorities and for legal matters." For those public authorities, there is extensive [[Language legislation in Belgium|language legislation]] concerning Dutch, French and German, even though the [[Belgian Constitution]] does not explicitly mention which languages enjoy official status. Article 4 does however divide the country into linguistic areas, which form the basis of the [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|federal structure]]: "Belgium has four linguistic areas: The French-speaking area, the Dutch-speaking area, the bilingual area of Brussels Capital and the German-speaking area."

Before the federal structure and the language legislation gradually introduced in the 20th century, French was generally the only language used by public authorities. For example, the Dutch version of the Constitution has enjoyed equal status to the original French one only since 1967, and the German version only since 1991.

[[File:Bilingual street sign Brussels.jpg|thumb|left|A traffic sign worded in both French and Dutch (as from top to bottom) in Brussels]]
Of the inhabitants of [[Belgium]], roughly 59% belong to the Flemish Community, 40% to the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] and 1% to the German-speaking Community, though these figures relating to official Belgian languages include unknown numbers of immigrants and their children speaking a foreign language as primary language, and of Belgian regional migrants which may be assumed to largely balance one another for natively French and Dutch speakers. Though the standard form of Dutch used in Belgium is almost identical to that spoken in the Netherlands and the different dialects spread across the border, it is often colloquially called "[[Flemish]]".

===Dutch===
{{See also|Flemish}}
Dutch is the official language of the [[Flemish Community]] and the [[Flemish Region]] (merged to [[Flanders]]) and, along with French, an official language of the [[Brussels-Capital Region]]. The main Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium are [[Brabantian]], [[West Flemish]], [[East Flemish]] and [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]]. All these are spoken across the border in the Netherlands as well, and West Flemish is also spoken in [[French Flanders]]. Much like English,  Flemish dialects have adopted much more French and other Romance vocabulary through mutual cultural exchange throughout history when compared with other Dutch dialects and as such they are not always readily intelligible for Dutch speakers outside Flanders. Words which are unique to Belgian Dutch are called ''[[belgicism]]s'' (as are words used primarily in [[Belgian French]]). The original Brabantian dialect of [[Brussels]] has been very much influenced by French. It is now spoken by a minority in the Capital region since the language of most inhabitants shifted during the [[Frenchification of Brussels]].

===French===
{{See also|Belgian French}}
The second-most spoken primary (Belgian) language, used natively by almost 40% of the population, is French.&lt;ref name=primarybelgianlanguage&gt;Footnote: Of the inhabitants of [[Belgium]], roughly 59% belong to the Flemish Community, 40% to the French Community and 1% to the German-speaking Community, though these figures relating to official Belgian languages include unknown numbers of immigrants and their children speaking a foreign language as primary language, and of Belgian regional migrants which may be assumed to largely balance one another for natively French and Dutch speakers.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the official language of the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] (which, like the Flemish Community, is a political entity), the dominant language in [[Wallonia]] (having also a small [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]]) as well as the [[Brussels-Capital Region]]. Almost all of the inhabitants of the Capital region speak French as either their primary language (50%) or as a [[lingua franca]] (45%).&lt;ref name=philippevanparijs&gt;

===German===
German is the least prevalent [[official language]] in Belgium, spoken natively by less than 1% of the population. The [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]] numbers 77,000, residing in an area of Belgium that was ceded by the former [[German Empire]] as part of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which concluded [[World War I]]. In 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] re-annexed the region following its invasion of Belgium during [[World War II]]; after the war it was returned to Belgium.

In national politics, politicians can freely choose to speak in any of the three official languages. In turn, the [[Belgian parliament]] provides simultaneous interpretation for those who require it to assist in communication.

Education is provided by the Communities, Dutch in the [[Flemish Community]] (Flanders and Brussels), French in the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] ([[Wallonia]] and Brussels), German in the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking community]]. Instruction in other languages is prohibited in government-funded schools except for foreign language subjects. However, the English language has become increasingly used in higher education.

Also all official correspondence and communication with the government (e.g. tax papers, local politics, ID/passport requests, building permits etc.) must be in the official language of the region or community. Inhabitants of a [[municipalities with language facilities|few municipalities]] are granted an exception to these rules.

==Multilingualism==
In 2006, the [[Université Catholique de Louvain]], the country's largest French-speaking university, published a report with the introduction (translated):

{{quote|This issue regarding economies is devoted to the demand for knowledge of languages in Belgium and in its three regions (Brussels, Flanders, Wallonia). The surveys show that Flanders is clearly more [[Multilingualism|multilingual]], which is without doubt a well-known fact, but the difference is considerable: whereas 59% and 53% of the Flemings know French or English respectively, only 19% and 17% of the Walloons know Dutch or English. The measures advocated by the Marshall Plan are heading towards the proper direction, but are doubtlessly quite insufficient to fully overcome the lag. [This particular 2006–2009 'Marshall Plan' was devised in 2004 and published in 2005 to uplift the Walloon economy.]&lt;ref&gt;

Within the report, professors in economics [[Victor Ginsburgh|Ginsburgh]] and [[Shlomo Weber|Weber]] further show that of the Brussels' residents, 95% declared they can speak French, 59% Dutch, and 41% know the non-local English. Of those under the age of forty, 59% in Flanders declared that they could speak all three, along with 10% in Wallonia and 28% in Brussels. In each region, Belgium's third official language, German, is notably less known than those.&lt;ref name=philippevanparijs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Non-official languages {{anchor|unofficial languages|langue endogène|langues endogènes|langue régionale endogène|langues régionales endogènes}} ==
[[File:Languages Benelux.PNG|thumb|right|Regional languages and dialects of the [[Benelux]] area]]
[[File:Linguistic map of Wallonia.png|thumb|right|A linguistic map of the original languages in Wallonia, now largely replaced by standard [[Belgian French]]]]

In addition to the three official languages, others are spoken in Belgium, like in [[Wallonia]], where French became dominant only relatively recently. Sometimes seen as dialects, the varieties related to French have been recognized by the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] as separate languages (''{{lang|fr|langues régionales endogènes}}'', {{abbr|lit.|literally}} ‘regional native languages’) since 1990,&lt;ref&gt;Décret Valmy Féaux, 14 December 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.languesregionales.cfwb.be/ Conseil des Langues régionales endogènes], e&lt;/ref&gt; without, however, taking any further significant measures to support those varieties.

=== Romance ===

====Walloon====
[[Walloon language|Walloon]] is the historical language of southern Belgium, and most of the areas where French is now spoken were Walloon-speaking. It is also the traditional [[national language]] of the [[Walloons]]. Though it has been recognized, like other vernaculars in Belgium, since 1990, it is mainly spoken by older people, though younger Walloons may claim some knowledge. It is mainly used in rural regions, and is used in theaters and literature, though not in schools.

====Picard====
Another language related to French, and a historic language of the region, [[Picard language|Picard]], was recognized by the government of the French Community in 1990. Western Belgium has its core area in France, stretching into the western part of Wallonia.

====Champenois====
[[Champenois language|Champenois]] was also legally recognized in 1990. It is mainly spoken in [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], France, and a small part of Wallonia.

====Lorrain==== 
Like the other indigenous languages closely related to French, [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]] was recognized in 1990. It is mainly spoken in [[Gaume]], a part of [[Belgian Lorraine]].

=== Germanic ===

====Flemish====
Flanders too has a number of dialects, but linguists regard these as varieties of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] rather than a separate [[Flemish language]] with the exception of [[Limburgish]] and [[West Flemish]]. The main Dutch dialects in Belgium are [[Brabantian]] and [[East Flemish]]. Standard Dutch, as spoken in Belgium, is mostly influenced by Brabantian. There are literary traditions in both the East Flemish and West Flemish dialects.

====Limburgish====
[[Limburgish]] is a language spoken mainly in north-eastern [[Belgium]] and the south-eastern [[Netherlands]], in the [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch]] provinces of Limburg. It is closely related to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] but has more [[German language|German]] influences.

====Low Dietsch====
[[Low Dietsch]] is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] language or dialect in the north-east of the Belgian province of Liege, in the kernel area of the historical (and linguistically mixed) [[Duchy of Limburg]]. It is spoken in towns and villages such as [[Plombières|Plombières ''(Bleiberg)'']], [[Gemmenich]], [[Hombourg, Belgium|Hombourg]], [[Montzen]] and [[Welkenraedt]]. By linguists, the variety is classified as a transition between [[Limburgish]] and [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]]. It has been defined as either varieties of Dutch or of German. Low Dietsch is acknowledged as an internal regional language by the Walloon authority since 1992. The Low Dietsch was the favorite foreign language of Andrew Jackson for its sound and eloquency. Low Dietsch is practically identical to the German dialect in the northern part of the neighbouring official [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking region of Belgium]]. The different definition is due to the fact that the German-speaking region was annexed by Belgium in 1919, whereas the "Low Dietsch" area has been part of Belgium since 1830.

====Luxembourgish====
[[Luxembourgish]], a [[Moselle Franconian]] language formerly regarded as a variety of German, is native to [[Arelerland]], the eastern part of the Belgian [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|province of Luxembourg]], including the city of [[Arlon|Arlon ''(Arel)'']]. Here it has largely been replaced by Belgian French in recent decades, contrarily to its flourishing on the other side of the border, in the Grand Duchy of [[Luxembourg]].

The language has, since 1990, been recognised by the Walloon authorities as ''{{lang|fr|Francique}}'' ([[Franconian languages|Franconian]]). It was the only non-Romance language recognized in the 1990 decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La protection des langues minoritaires en Europe: vers une nouvelle décennie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oEZkvwupVZkC&amp;pg=PA55|year=2010|publisher=Council of Europe|language=fr|isbn=978-92-871-6726-2|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yiddish====
[[Yiddish]] is spoken by many among the 20,000 [[History of the Jews in Antwerp|Ashkenazi Jews living in Antwerp]]. The Yiddish community there is among the strongest in Europe, and one of the few Jewish communities worldwide in which Yiddish remains the dominant language (others include [[Kiryas Joel, New York]], and similar Ashkenazi neighborhoods in the United States, [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Montreal]] and [[Israel]]).

=== Sign Languages ===

====LSFB====
LSFB, or [[French Belgian Sign Language]], is used primarily in Wallonia and Brussels and is related to [[French Sign Language|LSF]] and other [[French Sign Language family|Francosign languages]]. It developed from Old Belgian Sign Language which came about as a result of contact between [[Lyons Sign Language]] and LSF.

====VGT====
Like LSFB, [[Flemish Sign Language]], or VGT, is a Francosign language descended from Old Belgian Sign Language which is used primarily in Flanders with five major regional dialects: [[West Flanders]], [[East Flanders]], [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]], [[Flemish Brabant]], and [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]]. Moreover, there is dialectal variation between men and women speakers due to historical developments of the language.

==== DGS ====
Unlike VGT and LSFB, DGS, or [[German Sign Language]], is unrelated to LSF and comprises its own language family. DGS is related to [[Polish Sign Language|PJM]] and [[Israeli Sign Language|Shassi]]. It is primarily used around the German-speaking communities of Belgium, although German and DGS are unrelated.

===Main foreign languages===
Languages spoken by immigrants from recent decades and their descendants include [[Berber languages|Berber]] ([[Riff language|Riffian]]), [[Arabic]] ([[Maghrebi Arabic|Maghrebi]]), [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[English language|English]].

The '''Lezgic languages''' are one of seven branches of the [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language]] family. [[Lezgian language|Lezgian]] and [[Tabasaran language|Tabasaran]] are [[literary language]]s.

==The voicing of ejective consonants==
The Lezgic languages are relevant to the [[glottalic theory]] of Indo-European, because several have undergone the voicing of ejectives that have been postulated but widely derided as improbable in that family. The correspondences have not been well worked out (Rutul is inconsistent in the examples), but a few examples are: 

*Non-Lezgic: Avar {{IPA|tstsʼar}}; Lezgic: Rutul {{IPA|dur}}, Tsakhur {{IPA|do}} 'name'
*Non-Lezgic: Archi {{IPA|motʃʼor}}, Lak {{IPA|tʃʼiri}}; Lezgic: Rutul {{IPA|mitʃʼri}}, Tabassaran {{IPA|midʒir}}, Aɡul {{IPA|mudʒur}} 'beard'
*Non-Lezgic: Avar {{IPA|motsʼ}}; Lezgic: Tabassaran {{IPA|vaz}} 'moon'

A similar change has taken place in non-initial position in the [[Nakh languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Fallon, 2002. ''The synchronic and diachronic phonology of ejectives'', p 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4434">{{Distinguish|The Mad Scene}} A '''mad scene''' is an enactment of [[insanity]] in an [[opera]] or play.  It was a popular convention of [[Italy|Italian]] and [[France|French]] opera in the early decades of the nineteenth century. 

Mad scenes were often created as a way to offer star [[opera singer|singer]]s a chance to show off their abilities, though many of them are also very dramatic. The vocal writing is often exciting and highly demanding, requiring immense skill.  Most mad scenes were composed for the [[soprano]] voice, but there are examples for the [[baritone]] and the [[tenor]].

They are most popularly associated with works of the [[bel canto]] period, though examples may also be found in earlier works, such as [[George Frederick Handel]]'s ''[[Orlando (opera)|Orlando]]'' and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Idomeneo]]''. Almost all mad scenes were composed for either ''[[opera seria|opere serie]]'' or ''[[opera semiseria|opere semiserie]]''; [[Gaetano Donizetti]] was probably the most famous exponent of the form.

The convention of writing mad scenes largely died out after the [[bel canto]] era, as [[composer]]s sought to inject more realism into their operas.  More recently, some composers have returned to the form for dramatic effect, most notably [[Benjamin Britten]] in the final act of ''[[Peter Grimes]]''.

Similar mad scene techniques have also appeared in ballets, such as ''[[Giselle]]''.

The modern musical theatre has also been influenced by the operatic mad scene, as evidenced in ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.

'''Nand Lal Noorpuri''' ({{lang-pa|ਨੰਦ ਲਾਲ ਨੂਰਪੁਰੀ}}) was a well-known [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] poet, writer and lyricist of [[Punjab region|Punjab]].&lt;ref name="ti"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060811/jplus.htm | title=Free Spirit | date=August 11, 2006 | agency=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] | accessdate=March 30, 2012 | location=Chandigarh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bhs&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bharatsandesh.com/bharat/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21432&amp;Itemid=29 | title=ਨੰਦ ਲਾਲ ਨੂਰਪੁਰੀ | publisher=www.bharatsandesh.com | accessdate=March 30, 2012 | author=ਪ੍ਰੀਤ, ਰਣਜੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201192554/http://bharatsandesh.com/bharat/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21432&amp;Itemid=29 | archivedate=February 1, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote lyrics for many films including [[Mangti]]. He committed suicide on May 13, 1966.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt;&lt;ref name=bhs/&gt;

== Early life ==

Noorpuri was born in June 1906, to father Bishan Singh and mother Hukman Devi, in the Noorpur village of Layallpur district&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; in [[British Punjab]].&lt;ref name=bhs/&gt; He studied in Khalsa high school and Khalsa college in Layallpur (renamed as [[Faisalabad]] after partition). He quit college and joined first as a teacher and then as an assistant sub-inspector in [[Bikaner]]&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; in [[Rajasthan]] where he received a bravery award.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; He married  Sumittra Devi&lt;ref name=ti/&gt;&lt;ref name=bhs/&gt; and the couple was blessed with four daughters and two sons. After [[Partition of India|partition]], in 1947, he settled in [[Jalandhar]].&lt;ref name=ti/&gt;

== Career ==

In 1940, he left police force and came back to [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and wrote lyrics for [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] film [[Mangti]].&lt;ref name=ti/&gt;&lt;ref name=bhs/&gt;&lt;ref name="unp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unp.me/f16/nand-lal-noorpuri-80852/ | title=nand lal noorpuri | publisher=www.unp.me | accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that made him known to everyone in Punjab. But the [[Partition of India|partition]] changed everything for him. The source of income dried up. He lost his home and livelihood and came to [[Jalandhar]].&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; Later, he found work in radio and started participating in kavi darbars (English: poetic concerts). His songs sung by many notable singers of Punjab including [[Mohammad Rafi]],&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; [[Surinder Kaur]],&lt;ref name=bhs/&gt; [[Narinder Biba]], [[Asa Singh Mastana]], Parkash Kaur, A.S. Kang and more.

== Death ==

Disillusioned with his own poverty and lack of support and recognition from the government, he committed suicide on May 13, 1966,&lt;ref name=ti/&gt;&lt;ref name=bhs/&gt; by jumping into the well near his house in Model House Block-A colony, [[Jalandhar]].

== Nand Lal Noorpuri Society ==

Some years back, some poets and journalists formed the Nand Lal Noorpuri Society with the aim to spread the poet's work.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; Currently, it has the only annual award it gives to singers and poets. [[Sarbjit Cheema]] is the recent to receive this award for his song on girl foeticide.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt;

'''Old Sparky''' is the [[nickname]] of the [[electric chair]]s in [[Arkansas]], [[Connecticut]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Stateville Correctional Center|Illinois]], [[Kentucky]], [[Nebraska]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[South Carolina]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], and [[West Virginia]].  [[Old Smokey]] was the nickname of the electric chairs used in [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://freedom.answers.com/death-penalty/famous-electric-chairs-used-in-executions | title=Famous Electric Chairs Used in Executions | publisher=Answers.com | accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
"Old Sparky" is sometimes used to refer to electric chairs in general, and not one of a specific state.

==Connecticut==
Connecticut legislated [[lethal injection]] as its sole method of execution in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cga.ct.gov/2005/rpt/2005-R-0136.htm Connecticut Death Penalty Laws&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The last person executed by electrocution was [[Joseph "Mad Dog" Taborsky]] in May 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2010/10/18/news/doc4cbbd3b030403738863502.txt?viewmode=fullstory Tales of North Haven’s ‘high crimes’ captivate- The New Haven Register - Serving New Haven, Connecticut&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910172240/http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2010/10/18/news/doc4cbbd3b030403738863502.txt?viewmode=fullstory |date=2012-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecticut's "Old Sparky" has not been tested since it was moved from Wethersfield to the [[Northern Correctional Institution]] in [[Somers, Connecticut|Somers]] in 1962, and prison officials claim the prison's electrical system cannot handle it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/27/nyregion/execution-would-be-the-first-since-1960.html Execution Would Be The First Since 1960 - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Florida==
It was the sole means of execution in [[Florida]] from 1924 until 2000, when the [[Florida State Legislature]], under pressure from the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], signed [[lethal injection]] into law. Although no one has been executed in this manner since 1999, prisoners awaiting execution on Florida's death row may still be [[electric chair|electrocuted]] at their request. It is currently located in [[Florida State Prison]] on the outskirts of [[Starke, Florida|Starke]]. It was notorious for frequent malfunctions in the 1990s, namely in the cases of [[Jesse Tafero]] (executed May 4, 1990), [[Pedro Medina]] (executed March 25, 1997) and [[Allen Lee Davis]] (executed July 8, 1999). Reportedly, six-inch flames shot out of Tafero's head and 12-inch flames shot out of Medina's head, raising the question whether use of the electric chair was [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. After the Medina execution, [[Florida Attorney General]] [[Bob Butterworth]] commented, "People who wish to commit murder, they'd better not do it in the state of Florida because we may have a problem with the electric chair."&lt;ref&gt;Word, Ron. [http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970326/NEWS/303269969 "Flawed execution prompts Florida to study method"]. Associated Press, ''[[South Coast Today]]'', March 26, 1997. Retrieved on November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The malfunctions were probably due to practices of the prison staff and not because of the electric chair itself.  The wooden chair had been replaced in early 1999 to accommodate Davis's girth.   The electrical components remained the same for the system.

To assure proper contact between the inmate's head and the electrode, a saline-soaked [[sea sponge|sponge]] stuffed between the two was necessary. In the Tafero incident, a natural sponge was replaced with a synthetic sponge that caught fire during the execution. In the Medina incident, prison officials apparently did not properly soak the sponge in saline and it caught fire as well. Photographs that surfaced after Davis's execution clearly showed that his nose had been severely compressed by a misfitted head strap.

===Davis execution===
{{Weasel|date=March 2010}}
The 1999 execution of [[Allen Lee Davis]] incited outrage after witnesses saw his white shirt rapidly turn red with blood during his execution. Prison officials later determined the blood came from an unusually profuse nosebleed most likely caused by an improperly fitted head strap. The source of the blood was not evident to witnesses during execution, because Davis's head was covered with a traditional hood. A prison inspector general took photographs of Davis's body, still bloody and strapped in the chair, shortly after execution. These photographs later became key evidence in several cases mounting yet another challenge to the constitutionality of the electric chair. These lawsuits ultimately came to the [[Florida Supreme Court]] in the fall of 1999, when a bare majority (4 of the 7 Justices) found that the [[electric chair]] was constitutional in a case brought by death row inmate [[Thomas Harrison Provenzano|Thomas Provenzano]]. One of the dissenting Justices, [[Leander J. Shaw, Jr.]], took the extraordinary step of attaching to [http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/pre2004/ops/95973a.pdf his opinion] three color photographs of Davis's bloody body strapped in the chair. This publication marked the first time those photographs had surfaced on the Internet or, for that matter, anywhere outside court and prison files.

The effect was to create an immediate and sometimes macabre international debate over capital punishment in general and Florida's adherence to electrocution in particular. The Florida Supreme Court's web servers repeatedly crashed under the demand for access to the photographs, reputed to be the first actual photographs of an American state execution in decades. The photos were used during a protest demonstration in Madrid in support of a Spaniard on Florida's death row. Some death penalty supporters in the United States viewed the photographs as a deterrent, apparently believing they had been posted on the Website as a warning to all potentially dangerous criminals.

====Political response====
Some [[Florida]] politicians vowed never to eliminate the [[electric chair]] despite the debate, but events rapidly changed after the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] agreed to hear an appeal from the [[Florida Supreme Court]]'s split decision upholding electrocution. This action shocked some in Florida's leadership. The nation's high court had declined to review appeals after the prior three malfunctions, so observers concluded that the nation's high court now had come to view Florida's death penalty problems more dimly. Partly on the advice of [[Attorney General]] [[Bob Butterworth|Butterworth]], Florida's Governor [[Jeb Bush]] summoned the legislature into special session and in early 2000 it quickly approved [[lethal injection]] as the means of execution that must be used unless the inmate requests electrocution. The Attorney General then notified the Federal court and it agreed to dismiss the case based on the change in law.

==Georgia==
[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s [[electric chair]], known as "Old Sparky", located at [[Georgia State Prison]] was installed in 1924 following the state's abolition of [[hanging]] and was the sole method of execution in Georgia until October 25, 2001. The original chair, which was painted white, was replaced in 1980 and sent from the [[Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center]] back to Reidsville, while a squat, varnished replacement was constructed to replace it. Between 1924 and 1998, Georgia electrocuted 441 prisoners.  Today the original chair is on public display at Georgia State Prison, while its replacement is situated in a closet near the death chamber at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Multimedia.jsp?id=m-7043 The New Georgia Encyclopedia:  Old Sparky]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was famously used in the 1945 execution of [[Lena Baker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2917 The New Georgia Encyclopedia:  Lena Baker Case]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996, Georgia State Representative Doug Teper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/Archives/19951996/house/gahm61.htm|title=Representative Doug Teper (D-61)|publisher=Georgia House of Representatives|accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; unsuccessfully sponsored a bill to replace the state's electric chair with a [[guillotine]] in order to facilitate the use of the condemned prisoners' remains in [[organ donation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/Archives/19951996/leg/fulltext/hb1274.htm|title=Georgia House of Representatives - 1995/1996 Sessions HB 1274 - Death penalty; guillotine provisions|publisher=The General Assembly of Georgia|accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kentucky==
[[File:KY-State-Penitentiary.jpg|thumb|alt=A gray stone, castle-like building|The Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville houses Kentucky's Old Sparky]]
[[Kentucky]]'s [[electric chair]], known as "Old Sparky", is located at the [[Kentucky State Penitentiary]] in [[Eddyville, Kentucky]].  It was first used on July 8, 1911; the first inmate to die in the chair was James Buckner, convicted of killing a police officer several weeks earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990DE0D71431E233A2575AC0A9619C946096D6CF Electric Chair Used in Kentucky] ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 9, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 13, 1928, Kentucky set a record by electrocuting eight men in its chair, each immediately after the other, more than any other state has electrocuted in a single day.  The state has decommissioned the electric chair except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31, 1998 and choose death by electrocution rather than death by [[lethal injection]] or if lethal injection is declared unconstitutional by a court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 431.220 Execution of death sentence. |url= http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=18610 |publisher= lrc.ky.gov |accessdate=April 9, 2017}}{{cite web |title= 431.223 Method of execution in event of unconstitutionality of KRS 431.220. |url= http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=18611 |publisher= lrc.ky.gov |accessdate=April 9, 2017}}{{cite web |title= 431.224 Retroactive applicability. |url= http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=18612 |publisher= lrc.ky.gov |accessdate=April 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this legislated date, 163 deaths had occurred in Kentucky's electric chair. The last such execution by electric chair occurred on July 1, 1997, when convicted murderer [[Harold McQueen, Jr.|Harold McQueen]] was executed in it.

==New York==
[[File:Electric Chair at Sing Sing-noborder.jpg|thumb|A man being strapped into the electric chair at [[Sing Sing prison]] in the early 20th century.]]
In 1887, New York State established a committee to determine a new, more humane system of execution to replace [[hanging]]. Alfred P. Southwick, a member of the committee, developed the idea of putting electric current through a device after hearing about how relatively painlessly and quickly a drunken man died after touching exposed power lines. As Southwick was a dentist accustomed to performing procedures on sitting subjects, his electrical device appeared in the form of a chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Christen, AG|author2=Christen JA|title=Alfred P. Southwick, MDS, DDS: dental practitioner, educator and originator of electrical executions|journal=Journal of the History of Dentistry|volume=48|issue=3|pages=115–45|date=November 2000|pmid=11806253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 1888, [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[David B. Hill]] authorized the introduction of the electric chair. It was first used two years later when [[William Kemmler]] became the first person in the world to be [[electrocution|executed by electricity]] at [[Auburn Prison]], [[Auburn, New York]] on August 6, 1890.

"Old Sparky" was first used at [[Sing Sing prison]] for a mass execution on July 7, 1891. The order of execution, which would start at 4:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., was listed as James J. Slocum, Harris Smiler, Shibuya Jugiro, and Joseph Wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseballhistoryblog.com/tag/baseball-execution/|title=Jimmy Slocum Executed, Minor League Ballplayer|publisher=baseballhistoryblog.com|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chair was situated in a purpose-built building known as the Death House which was a prison within the high-security Sing Sing prison. The block, which had its own hospital, kitchen, visiting room, and exercise yard, had 24 single cells plus an additional three cells for condemned women. A chamber where a prisoner spent their last day was nicknamed the "Dance Hall". A corridor, known as the "Last Mile", connected the ante-room to the execution chamber.

Executions at Sing Sing were traditionally carried out at 11 p.m. on Thursdays. Condemned prisoners would be brought into the execution room escorted by seven guards and the [[prison chaplain]]. Already waiting in the room would be the [[warden of Sing Sing]], the [[state electrician]], two doctors and twelve state appointed witnesses. After the condemned prisoner was strapped into the chair and the electrodes attached, the warden would step forward and read out the [[death penalty|final decision]] on the sentence. The prisoner would be asked for any last words or for a [[benediction]]. With a signal, the execution would then begin. Witnesses would leave once both doctors had confirmed that death had occurred.

In its 75 years of operation, a total of 695 men and women were executed by the electric chair in New York state (614 at Sing Sing alone). From 1914, all executions were conducted at Sing Sing prison using "Old Sparky". [[Eddie Mays]] would become the last person to be executed on August 15, 1963. Two years later New York state abolished [[Capital punishment in New York|capital punishment]]. The state would later reinstate the practice in 1995 using lethal injection, but the practice was abolished again in 2004, after the [[New York Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] ruled in ''[[People v. LaValle]]'' that it violated the state constitution.  No inmates were executed during the nine years that capital punishment was reinstated in New York.

==Ohio==
[[Ohio]] was the second state to adopt the electric chair as a means of execution, executing 315 people between 1897 and its last use was in 1963. The state stopped using the [[electric chair]] in 2001, and now exclusively utilizes [[lethal injection]] in executions. Ohio's Old Sparky is now a museum exhibit in the [[Ohio State Reformatory]].

==South Carolina==
The state installed the "Old Sparky" in 1912 at the [[Central Correctional Institution]] (CCI) in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.sc.us/scdah/exhibits/ccitimeline.htm State of South Carolina:  Central Correctional Institution Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 it was used to execute 14-year-old [[George Stinney]], the youngest person to be sentenced to death in the United States for more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25831553|title=US judge hears appeal on teen executed in 1940s|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the chair was relocated to the newly built [[Broad River Correctional Institution]]. It is managed by the [[South Carolina Department of Corrections]].

In 1997 all death row inmates were relocated from Broad River to the Lieber Correctional Institution. The move provided better management controls and ensured correctional staff who dealt with condemned prisoners on a daily basis were not the same officers given the responsibility of carrying out the [[death penalty|death sentence]].&lt;ref name="Deathrow"&gt;"[http://www.doc.sc.gov/news/deathrow.jsp Death Row/Capital Punishment]." [[South Carolina Department of Corrections]]. Retrieved on August 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent use of "Old Sparky" was in June 21, 2008 when convicted murderer [[James Earl Reed]] opted for this method of execution.

==Texas==
[[File:Texas sparky.jpg|thumb|upright|Old Sparky, the electric chair formerly used at [[Huntsville Unit]] prison, Texas]]
The Texas electric chair to which the name "Old Sparky" is applied was in use from 1924 to 1964.  During that time, it saw the deaths of 361 prisoners sentenced to die by judicial electrocution.  It was built by incarcerated craftsmen in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadsideamerica.com/set/crimechairs.html Roadside America: Texas Prison Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;  Following its decommissioning, it was originally relegated to a prison dump before being rescued.  Today, it is on public display as part of a replica death chamber at the [[Texas Prison Museum]] in [[Huntsville, Texas]], along with tubing and straps used in Texas' first execution by [[lethal injection]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/features/2002/2002-11-12-prison-museum.htm Texas electric chair gets permanent museum home] '' [[USA Today]]'', November 19, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/TXHUNprison.html Texas Prison Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the Greater Dallas Crime Commission, a business organization, circulated a petition to recommission Texas' "Old Sparky".  The petition received 10,620 endorsements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904831,00.html Bring Back "Old Sparky"] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', March 15, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==West Virginia==
The now-decommissioned [[electric chair]] known as "Old Sparky" at the now-closed [[West Virginia State Penitentiary]] in [[Moundsville, West Virginia]] was installed in a facility originally used for [[hanging]].  It was in use from 1951 until 1959, during which time nine condemned prisoners were executed in the chair.  The chair was bolted to a low platform which covered what had previously been the trapdoor of the [[gallows]] used in the state's judicial hangings.  Its control apparatus was designed in such a way that three push-button switches were to be simultaneously pressed by three members of the execution team; only one of these switches actually completed the circuit, allowing each member of the execution team to reassure himself that perhaps he had not been the one who had actually initiated the death of the condemned.&lt;ref name="West Virginia Penitentiary"&gt;[http://www.wvpentours.com/ West Virginia Penitentiary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* ''[[The Green Mile (book)|The Green Mile]]'' by [[Stephen King]] and its [[The Green Mile (film)|film adaptation]] use ''Old Sparky'' as the official method of execution. 
* In an episode of ''[[King of the Hill]]'', [[Dale Gribble]], excited about being on the executioner list as a new employee of a local prison, asks the prison warden where ''Old Sparky'' is. The warden explains that ''Old Sparky'' is no longer, replaced by [[lethal injection]]. Dale then asks where ''Old Squirty'' is, a variation on the original title.
* In the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' and in the related novels, serial killer [[Dexter Morgan]] frequently cites "Old Sparky" as the consequence of his being caught.
* In the 2005 horror suspense film ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'', Club owner and neutral angel Papa Midnite, and John Constantine make use of the Old Sparky chair from Sing Sing prison to help John locate the Spear of Destiny.
* Old Sparky also appeared in the 2002 film, ''[[Ted Bundy (film)|Ted Bundy]]'' directed by [[Matthew Bright]] which dramatizes the serial killings of [[Ted Bundy]] portrayed by [[Michael Reilly Burke]]. His execution is also depicted in the film but it is carried out inaccurately.

'''Orissa Balu''' ({{lang-ta|ஒரிசா பாலு}}) (born 1963) is a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] researcher and writer from [[Uraiyur]] in the south Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]].

==Life and works==

Born to Sivagnanam and Rajeshwari. Presently researching based on Sea Turtles and Human Migration happened in the past 
by Tamil Community.He is also doing extensive research on [[Kumari Kandam]].

A graduate of physics, through self-study a bachelor in engineering and also in library science,remote sensing  and  his moving to Orissa in 1989 was a turning point for him, for it kindled his interest on the Orissan culture.

Mr.S. Balasubramani   researching in lost cities and turtle guided ocean routes for mapping the turtle corridor along the Indian coast and Indo pacific ocean. His interaction with the people  around when he travels outside Tamil Nadu, which he has been doing very frequently and his establishing rapport with the coastal community and learning from the people, are a few examples of his novel approach. 
That he could attract the attention of Orissan royalty and the resulting friendship with it is another dimension of his personality. 
 
Researched on the Kalinga-Tamil relationship was the beginning which became his passion for research into the Tamil history. 
His present research area is ‘Culture through Geography.Going beyond the emotional approach to the existence of Lemuria, Balasubramani, in addition to the study of literary references, conducts experiments on the Tamil coast making use of the traditional knowledge of the coastal community. He claims, which is important, that the traditional sailors and fishermen have a lot to contribute towards our knowledge of navigation, tsunamis and how transgression and regression in the Tamil Nadu coast had affected history, society and livelihoods. 
 
He has been regularly interacting with research students, orienting the students for developing import substitutes in earth science equipment which will be ultimately help for archaeologist to redefine our cultural heritage. 
 
His another favorite ‘pastime’ is ‘capacity building’, creating a number of groups who participate in socially relevant activities using the history as a tool, for which, he says, he is ‘carrying Gandhi along with him’. His longtime works at south east Indian coast is  on identifying turtle corridor on Indo- Pacific ocean  through interdisciplinary ocean studies and combination of paleolithic peoples sea faring is creating an awareness on lateral approach on rediscovering our glory of the past 
 
Now he is concentrating on his Integrated ocean culture research foundation.

[[File:Mothing on BukitRetakBrunei2.jpg|300px|thumb|upright=1.8|Moths are positively phototactic]]
'''Phototaxis''' is a kind of [[taxis]], or locomotory movement, that occurs when a whole organism moves towards or away from [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] of [[light]].&lt;ref name=Martin1983&gt;{{citation|editor=Martin, Or Phototatic movement is an autonomic movement in response to the stimulus of lightE.A.|year=1983|title=Macmillan Dictionary of Life Sciences|edition=2nd|page=362|place=London|publisher=Macmillan Press|isbn=0-333-34867-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is advantageous for [[phototroph]]ic organisms as they can orient themselves most efficiently to receive light for [[photosynthesis]]. Phototaxis is called positive if the movement is in the direction of increasing light intensity and negative if the direction is opposite.&lt;ref name=Menzel1979&gt;{{citation|author=Menzel, Randolf|year=1979|editor=H. Autrum (editor)|chapter=Spectral Sensitivity and Color Vision in Invertebrates |title=Comparative Physiology and Evolution of Vision in Invertebrates- A: Invertebrate Photoreceptors|location=New York|series=Handbook of Sensory Physiology|volume=VII/6A|pages=503–580. See section D: Wavelength-Specific Behavior and Color Vision|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=3-540-08837-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types of positive phototaxis are observed in [[prokaryote]]s. The first is called '''scotophobotaxis''' (from the word "[[scotophobia]]"), which is observed only under a microscope. This occurs when a bacterium swims by chance out of the area illuminated by the microscope. Entering darkness signals the cell to reverse [[Flagellum|flagella]] rotation direction and reenter the light. The second type of phototaxis is true phototaxis, which is a directed movement up a gradient to an increasing amount of light. This is analogous to positive [[chemotaxis]] except that the attractant is light rather than a chemical.

Phototactic responses are observed in many organisms such as ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'', ''[[Tetrahymena]]'', and ''[[Euglena]]''. Each organism has its own specific biological cause for a phototactic response, many of which are incidental and serve no end purpose.

The direction where the light is coming from is indicated by white bars.&lt;ref name=Randel2014 /&gt;]]

Phototaxis in [[zooplankton]] is well studied in the marine [[annelid]] ''[[Platynereis dumerilii]]'':

''Platynereis dumerilii'' [[trochophore]] and [[metatrochophore]] larvae are positively phototactic. Phototaxis there is mediated by simple eyespots that consists of a [[pigment]] cell and a [[photoreceptor cell]]. The photoreceptor cell synapses directly onto ciliated cells, which are used for swimming. The eyespots do not give spatial resolution, therefore the larvae are rotating to scan their environment for the direction where the light is coming from.&lt;ref name=Jekely2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jékely|first1=Gáspár|last2=Colombelli|first2=Julien|last3=Hausen|first3=Harald|last4=Guy|first4=Keren|last5=Stelzer|first5=Ernst|last6=Nédélec|first6=François|last7=Arendt|first7=Detlev|title=Mechanism of phototaxis in marine zooplankton|journal=Nature|date=20 November 2008|volume=456|issue=7220|pages=395–399|doi=10.1038/nature07590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Platynereis dumerilii'' [[nectochaete]] larvae can switch between positive and negative phototaxis. Phototaxis there is mediated by two pairs of more complex pigment cup eyes. These eyes contain more photoreceptor cells that are shaded by pigment cells forming a cup. The photoreceptor cells do not synapse directly onto ciliated cells or muscle cells but onto inter-neurons of a processing center. This way the information of all four eye cups can be compared and a low resolution image of four pixels can be created telling the larvae where the light is coming from. This way the larva does not need to scan its environment by rotating.&lt;ref name=Randel2014 /&gt; This is an adaption for living on the bottom of the sea the life style of the nectochaete larva while scanning rotation is more suited for living in the open water column, the life style of the trochophore larva. Phototaxis in the ''Platynereis dumerilii'' nectochaete larva has a broad spectral range which is at least covered by three [[opsin]]s that are expressed by the cup eyes:&lt;ref name=Guehmann2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gühmann|first1=Martin|last2=Jia|first2=Huiyong|last3=Randel|first3=Nadine|last4=Verasztó|first4=Csaba|last5=Bezares-Calderón|first5=Luis A.|last6=Michiels|first6=Nico K.|last7=Yokoyama|first7=Shozo|last8=Jékely|first8=Gáspár|title=Spectral Tuning of Phototaxis by a Go-Opsin in the Rhabdomeric Eyes of Platynereis|journal=Current Biology|date=August 2015|volume=25|issue=17|pages=2265–2271|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.07.017|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215008209|pmid=26255845}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two rhabdomeric opsins&lt;ref name=Randel2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Randel|first1=N.|last2=Bezares-Calderon|first2=L.

However, not every behavior that looks like phototaxis is phototaxis: ''Platynereis dumerilii'' nechtochate and metatrochophore larvae swim up first when they are stimulated with UV-light from above. But after a while, they change the direction and avoid the UV-light by swimming down. This looks like a change from positive to negative phototaxis (see video left), but the larvae also swim down if UV-light comes non-directionally from the side. And so they do not swim to or away from the light, but swim down,&lt;ref name="Veraszto2018" /&gt; this means to the center of gravity. Thus this is a UV-induced positive [[gravitaxis]]. Positive phototaxis (swimming to the light from the surface) and positive gravitaxis (swimming to the center of gravity) are induced by different ranges of wavelengths and cancel out each other at a certain ratio of wavelengths.&lt;ref name="Veraszto2018" /&gt; Since the wavelengths compositions change in water with depth: Short (UV, violet) and long (red) wavelengths are lost first&lt;ref name=Guehmann2015 /&gt;, phototaxis and gravitaxis form a ratio-chromatic [[depth gauge]], which allows the larvae to determine their depth by the color of the surrounding water. This has the advantage over a brightness based depth gauge that the color stays almost constant independent of the time of the day or whether it is cloudy.&lt;ref name="Nilsson2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nilsson |first1=Dan-Eric |title=The evolution of eyes and visually guided behavior |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=31 August 2009 |volume=364 |issue=1531 |pages=2833–2847 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0083 |pmid=19720648|pmc=2781862 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nilsson2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nilsson |first1=Dan-Eric |title=Eye evolution and its functional basis |journal=Visual Neuroscience |date=12 April 2013 |volume=30 |issue=1-2 |pages=5–20 |doi=10.1017/S0952523813000035 |pmid=23578808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phototaxis in jellyfish ==
Positive and negative phototactic behaviour can be found in several species of [[jellyfish]] such as species from the [[polyorchis]] genus. Jellyfish utilize [[Simple eye in invertebrates|ocelli]] to detect the presence and absence of light, which is then translated into anti-predatory behaviour in the case of a shadow being cast over the ocelli, or feeding behaviour in the case of the presence of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katsuki|first=Takeo|last2=Greenspan|first2=Ralph J.|date=July 2013|title=Jellyfish nervous systems|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.03.057|journal=Current Biology|volume=23|issue=14|pages=R592–R594|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2013.03.057|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many tropical jellyfish contain [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[zooxanthellae]] within their cells and have a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/970002268|title=Invertebrate zoology : a functional evolutionary approach|last=E.,|first=Ruppert, Edward|others=Barnes, Robert D.,, Fox, Richard S.,|isbn=9788131501047|edition=Seventh edition|location=Delhi, India|oclc=970002268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jellyfish receives nourishment, provides protection, and locomotion toward light sources such as the sun to provide the greatest exposure to the light. In the presence of a shadow the jellyfish can either remain still, or perform a quick burst of movement to avoid [[predation]] and also readjust toward a new light source.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=P.|last2=Mackie|first2=G.|date=1977-07-08|title=Electrically coupled, photosensitive neurons control swimming in a jellyfish|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.17918|journal=Science|volume=197|issue=4299|pages=186–188|doi=10.1126/science.17918|issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This motor response to light and absence of light of is facilitated by a chemical response from the ocelli, which results in a motor response causing the organism to swim toward a light source.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Phototaxis in insects ==
Positive phototactic behaviour in insects can be found primarily in insects capable of flight such as many species of flies, moths, and grasshoppers. ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' has been studied extensively on its innate positive phototactic response to light sources using controlled experiments to help understand the connection between airborne [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] toward a light source.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/023846|title=A decision underlies phototaxis in an insect.|last=Gorostiza|first=E. Axel|last2=Colomb|first2=Julien|date=2015-08-03|access-date=2018-11-18|last3=Brembs|first3=Bjoern}}&lt;/ref&gt; This innate response is common among insects that fly primarily during the night utilizing [[transverse orientation]] with the light of the moon to fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Andy M.|last2=Reynolds|first2=Don R.|last3=Sane|first3=Sanjay P.|last4=Hu|first4=Gao|last5=Chapman|first5=Jason W.|date=2016-08-15|title=Orientation in high-flying migrant insects in relation to flows: mechanisms and strategies|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2015.0392|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=371|issue=1704|pages=20150392|doi=10.1098/rstb.2015.0392|issn=0962-8436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial lights in cities and populated areas result in a more bright and positive response compared to the distant light of the moon, resulting in the organism repeatedly responding to this new [[supernormal stimulus]] and innately flying toward it.

Evidence for the innate response of positive phototactic behaviour in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' was carried out by altering the wings of several individuals both physically via removal, or genetically via mutation. In all cases the organisms with wings removed and wings mutated there was a noticeable lack of positive phototactic behaviour demonstrating flying toward light is an innate response to the organisms photoreceptors receiving a positive response.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Negative phototaxis can be observed in larval ''drosophila melanogaster'' within the first three developmental [[Instar|instars]] despite the adult insect displaying positive phototaxis.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Riveros|first=A.J.|title=Magnetic Compasses in Insects|date=2010|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-045337-8.00075-9|work=Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior|pages=305–313|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080453378|access-date=2018-11-18|last2=Srygley|first2=R.B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour is common among other species of insects which possess a flightless larval and adult stage in their life cycles, only switching to positive phototactic behaviour when searching for [[Pupa|pupation]] sites. ''[[Mealworm|Tenebrio molitor]]'' is once such species which carries its negative phototactic behaviour into adulthood.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Relation to magnetic fields ==
Under experimental conditions organisms that utilize positive phototactic behaviour have also shown correlation with light and magnetic fields. Under [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]] light conditions with a shifting magnetic field ''drosophila melanogaster'' larva reorient themselves toward predicted directions of greater or lesser light intensities as expected by a rotating magnetic field. In complete darkness the same organism orients randomly without any notable preference.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This suggests a visible pattern can be observed by the organism in combination with light.

[[File:PiteTerritory.jpg|thumb|The approximate area in which Pite Saami was traditionally spoken]]

'''Pite Sami''', also known as Arjeplog Sami, is a [[Sami languages|Sami language]] traditionally spoken in [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]]. It is a [[endangered language|critically endangered language]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger]&lt;/ref&gt; that has only about 25&amp;ndash;50&lt;ref name=speakers&gt;''At least 25 speakers in 2010'' according to researcher Joshua Wilbur. At least 30 active, native speakers in 2010; at least an additional 20 native speakers who do not use the language actively according to the Pite Sami dictionary project leader Nils Henrik Bengtsson.&lt;/ref&gt; native speakers left and is now only spoken on the Swedish side of the border along the [[Pite River]] in the north of [[Arjeplog Municipality|Arjeplog]] and [[Arvidsjaur]] and in the mountainous areas of the [[Arjeplog Municipality|Arjeplog]] municipality.

==Classification==
Pite Sami is a part of the Western Sami group, together with [[Southern Sami]] and [[Ume Sami]] to the south, [[Lule Sami]] and [[Northern Sami]] to the north. Of these, Pite Sami shows closest affinity to Lule Sami, but a number of features also show similarity to Ume and Southern Sami.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

The Pite Sami consonant inventory is very similar to that found in neighbouring Lule Sami, but lacks contrastive voicing of stops and affricates entirely.

* Stops before a [[homorganic]] nasal (pre-stopped nasals) are realised as [[unreleased stop]]s.
* {{IPA|/v/}} is realised as a labiodental fricative {{IPA|[v]}} in the syllable onset (before a vowel), and as bilabial {{IPA|[w]}} in the syllable coda (in a consonant cluster).
* {{IPA|/ð/}} is present only in the language of some elderly speakers. It is otherwise replaced by {{IPA|/r/}} or {{IPA|/t/}}, depending on dialect.

===Vowels===

The Pite Sami vowel inventory has a relative lack of phonemic diphthongs, compared to other Sami languages and particularly neighbouring Lule Sami. Instead, there are more vowel height distinctions.

* The close vowels /i/ and /u/ are realized as laxer [ɪ] and [ʊ] respectively, in unstressed positions.
* Close-mid /e/ and /o/ are diphthongized to [ie̯] and [uo̯] respectively, when stressed.
* {{IPA|/ɔ/}} contrasts with {{IPA|/ɔː/}} in near-minimal pairs such as ''båhtet'' {{IPA|/ˈpɔːhtet/}} "to come" vs ''båhtjet'' {{IPA|/ˈpɔhtet/}} "to milk".
* {{IPA|/ɛ/}} does not occur in unstressed syllables.
* {{IPA|/ɔ/}} can occur in unstressed syllables, but only when a preceding stressed syllable contains {{IPA|/ɔ/}}.

==Dialects==

Sammallahti&lt;ref name="Sammallahti"&gt;{{cite book|first=Pekka|last=Sammallahti|title=The Saami Languages: An Introduction|year=1998|publisher=Davvi Girji|location=Kárášjohka}}&lt;/ref&gt; divides Lule Sami dialects as follows:

* Northern dialects: [[Luokta-Mávas]] in Sweden
* Central dialects: [[Semisjaur-Njarg]] in Sweden
* Southern dialects: [[Svaipa]] in Sweden

Features of the northern dialects are:
* Lack of {{IPA|/aː/}} &amp;rarr; {{IPA|/eː/}} umlaut.
* Voicing in quantity 3 of plain stops (thus strong {{IPA|/bː.b/}} ~ weak {{IPA|/p.p/}} etc.), like in Lule Sami.
* {{IPA|/t/}} as the outcome of Proto-Samic ''*đ''.

Features of the southern dialects are:
* {{IPA|/r/}} as the outcome of Proto-Samic ''*đ''.

==Orthography==
Pite Sámi is one of the four Sami languages that does not have an official written language. A working orthography has been developed in 2008–2011 by the Sami Association of Arjeplog.&lt;ref&gt;(Wilbur 2014:18–19)&lt;/ref&gt; It closely resembles the orthography of neighbouring [[Lule Sami]].

===Verbs===

====Person====
Pite Sami [[verb]]s conjugate for three [[grammatical person]]s:

*first person
*second person
*third person

====Mood====
Pite Sami has five [[grammatical mood]]s:

*[[Grammatical mood#Indicative|indicative]]
*[[Imperative mood|imperative]]
*[[Conditional mood|conditional]]
*[[Grammatical mood#Potential|potential]]
*[[Optative mood|optative]]

====Grammatical number====
Pite Sami [[verb]]s conjugate for three [[grammatical number]]s:

*[[Grammatical number|singular]]
*[[Dual grammatical number|dual]]
*[[plural]]

====Tense====
Pite Sami [[verb]]s conjugate for two simple [[Grammatical tense|tenses]]:

*[[Preterite|past]]
*[[Grammatical tense|non-past]]

and two [[circumlocution|compound tenses]]:

*[[Present perfect]]
*[[Pluperfect]]

====Negative verb====
Pite Sami, like Finnish, the other Sámi languages and Estonian, has a [[negative verb]]. In Pite Sámi, the negative verb conjugates according to [[Grammatical mood|mood]] ([[indicative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]] and [[Optative mood|optative]]), [[Grammatical person|person]] (1st, 2nd and 3rd) and [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular, dual and plural). This differs from some other the other [[Sami languages]], e.g. from [[Northern Sami]], which do not conjugate according to [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and other Sami languages, that do not use the optative.

    Non-past indicative       Past indicative                           
    sg.  du.    pl.           sg.     du.        pl.      
 1  iv   ien    iehp        1 ittjiv  iejmen    iejmeh    
                iep                   ittjijmen ittjijmeh           
 2  ih   iehpen iehpit      2 ittjih  iejten    iejteh    
         ähpen  ihpit                 ittjijten ittjijteh

         iepán                        ittjijka

For non-past indicative versions that have more than one form, the second one is from the dialect spoken around Björkfjället and the third is from the Svaipa dialect. The plurality in the other forms is due to parallel forms that are not bound by dialect.

'''Rachel Treweek''' (''[[née]]'' '''Montgomery'''; born 4 February 1963) is a British [[Anglican]] [[bishop]], [[Lords Spiritual|Lord Spiritual]] and former [[speech and language therapist]]. Since June 2015, she has been [[Bishop of Gloucester]], the first female [[diocesan bishop]] in the [[Church of England]]. From 2011 until 2015, she was the [[Archdeacon of Hackney]] in the [[Diocese of London]].

==Early life and career==
Treweek was born Rachel Montgomery on 4 February 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Who's Who| surname = Treweek| othernames = Rachel| id = U59370| volume = 2014| edition = November 2014 online| accessed = 19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated at [[Broxbourne School]], a [[state school]] in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire.&lt;ref name="Diocese of Gloucester - The Bishop of Gloucester Designate" /&gt; She studied at the [[University of Reading]] and graduated in 1984 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) degree in linguistics and language pathology.&lt;ref name="Diocese of Gloucester - The Bishop of Gloucester Designate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crockford"&gt;{{Crockford| surname =Treweek | forename = Rachel | id =581 | accessed = 30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wilt_NewB"&gt;{{Cite web| title = New Bishop of Gloucester Rachel Treweek to be first woman in the Church of England to be consecrated as a diocesan bishop| author = 20 July 2015| work = Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard| date = | accessdate = 21 July 2015| url = http://www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk/news/13465862.New_Bishop_of_Gloucester_Rachel_Treweek_to_be_first_woman_in_the_Church_of_England_to_be_consecrated_as_a_diocesan_bishop/?ref=rss| quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treweek's first career was as a [[speech and language therapist]]. After six years as a [[paediatric]] speech therapist in the [[National Health Service]], she left her job to begin training for ordination in the Church of England.&lt;ref name="Christian Today - Church of England appoints first female diocesan bishop"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gledhill|first1=Ruth|title=Church of England appoints first female diocesan bishop|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/church.of.england.appoints.first.female.diocesan.bishop/50791.htm|accessdate=29 March 2015|work=Christian Today|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diocese of London - The Archdeacon of Hackney, the Venerable Rachel Treweek, announced as the next Bishop of Gloucester"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Archdeacon of Hackney, the Venerable Rachel Treweek, announced as the next Bishop of Gloucester|url=http://www.london.anglican.org/articles/the-archdeacon-of-hackney-the-venerable-rachel-treweek-announced-as-the-next-bishop-of-gloucester/|website=Communications|publisher=Diocese of London|accessdate=26 March 2015|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordained ministry==
Treweek studied for ordained ministry at [[Wycliffe Hall, Oxford]], an Anglican [[theological college]], and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Theology]] (BTh) degree in 1994. She was made a [[Deacon#Anglicanism|deacon]] at [[Petertide]] 1994 (3 July), by [[David Hope (bishop)|David Hope]], [[Bishop of London]], at [[St Paul's Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Church Times | title = Ordinations | archive = 1994_07_15_005 | issue = 6857 | date = 15 July 1994 | page = 5 | accessed = 10 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ordained a [[Priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priest]] the following Petertide (27 June 1995), by [[Martin Wharton]], [[Bishop of Kingston]], at her title church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Church Times | title = Ordinations continued | archive = 1995_07_07_008 | issue = 6908 | date = 7 July 1995 | page = 8 | accessed = 10 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1994 to 1997, she served a [[Curate|curacy]] at St George and All Saints Church, [[Tufnell Park]], London. From 1997 to 1999, she remained at St George and All Saints Church as the associate vicar.&lt;ref name="GOV - Diocese of Gloucester: Venerable Rachel Treweek"&gt;{{cite web|title=Diocese of Gloucester: Venerable Rachel Treweek|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/diocese-of-gloucester-venerable-rachel-treweek|website=Press release|publisher=Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street|accessdate=26 March 2015|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, she was appointed [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]] of [[St James-the-Less, Bethnal Green]], London.&lt;ref name="Diocese of London - The Archdeacon of Hackney, the Venerable Rachel Treweek, announced as the next Bishop of Gloucester" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london.anglican.org/Archdeacons "Archdeacons"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205054248/http://www.london.anglican.org/Archdeacons |date=2012-02-05 }}, Diocese of London website.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbency]], she was appointed the continuing ministerial education officer for the [[Diocese of London]].&lt;ref name="crockford" /&gt;

In 2006, Treweek left [[parish]] ministry on her appointment as the [[Archdeacon of Northolt]]; this made her one of six [[archdeacon]]s in the Diocese of London.&lt;ref name="Hackney Gazette - New Archdeacon of Hackney is appointed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gregory|first1=Julia|title=New Archdeacon of Hackney is appointed|url=http://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/new_archdeacon_of_hackney_is_appointed_1_896898|accessdate=27 March 2015|work=Hackney Gazette|date=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She held the position for five years before becoming the [[Archdeacon of Hackney]] on 14 May 2011.&lt;ref name="crockford" /&gt; She relinquished this appointment on confirmation of her appointment as Bishop of Gloucester on 15 June 2015.&lt;ref name="Telegraph - Belle bells in Bow" /&gt;

In September 2013, Treweek was elected as one of eight "participant observers" of the [[House of Bishops]] as the observer representing the [[South East of England]].&lt;ref name="Church of England - First Female Representatives to House of Bishops Elected"&gt;{{cite web|title=First Female Representatives to House of Bishops Elected|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2013/09/first-female-representatives-to-house-of-bishops-elected.aspx|website=Media Centre|publisher=The Church of England|accessdate=26 March 2015|date=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The observers are senior priests who are women and who will attend and participate in meetings of the House of Bishops until six women sit in the House by right as bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Madeleine|title=Women dignitaries to be elected as Bishops' 'participant observers'|url=http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2013/8-february/news/uk/women-dignitaries-to-be-elected-as-bishops%E2%80%99-%E2%80%98participant-observers%E2%80%99|accessdate=19 December 2014|work=Church Times|date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended her first meeting of the House of Bishops of the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] on 9 December 2013.&lt;ref name="Christian Today - Female observers join House of Bishops meeting"&gt;{{cite news|title=(Photo) Female observers join House of Bishops meeting|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/photo.observers.join.women.bishops.meeting/34990.htm|accessdate=26 March 2015|work=Christian Today|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Episcopal ministry===
On 26 March 2015, it was announced that Treweek was to become the next [[Bishop of Gloucester]], the [[diocesan bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Gloucester]].&lt;ref name="Diocese of Gloucester - The Bishop of Gloucester Designate"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bishop of Gloucester Designate|url=http://www.gloucester.anglican.org/about/the-bishop-of-gloucester-designate/|website=About the Diocese|publisher=Diocese of Gloucester|accessdate=26 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114754/http://www.gloucester.anglican.org/about/the-bishop-of-gloucester-designate/|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there have been two women appointed bishops previously, she is the first woman to be appointed a diocesan bishop, rather than as a [[suffragan bishop]].&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph - Church of England names first female bishop to sit in the House of Lords"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Church of England names first female bishop to sit in the House of Lords|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11496047/Church-of-England-names-first-female-bishop-to-sit-in-the-House-of-Lords.html|accessdate=26 March 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first woman to become a bishop in the [[Province of Canterbury]], jointly with [[Sarah Mullally]], [[Bishop of Crediton]].&lt;ref name="BBC News - Rachel Treweek to become the new bishop of Gloucester"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rachel Treweek to become the new bishop of Gloucester|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-32064611|accessdate=26 March 2015|work=BBC News|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 June 2015, her [[Confirmation of bishops|election was confirmed]] during a sitting of the [[Arches Court of Canterbury]] at [[St Mary-le-Bow]], [[City of London]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph - Belle bells in Bow"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bingham|first1=John|title=Belle bells in Bow as Church of England celebrates first female diocesan bishop|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11678269/Belle-bells-in-Bow-as-Church-of-England-celebrates-first-female-diocesan-bishop.html|accessdate=16 June 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/diary.php/5159/bishop-of-gloucester-confirmation-of-election Archbishop of Canterbury — Diary: Bishop of Gloucester — Confirmation of Election] (Accessed 27 May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, she legally became the Bishop of Gloucester.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G5dDqXqWrbUC&amp;pg=PA81 ''Working with the Spirit: Choosing Diocesan Bishops: a Review of the Operation of the Crown Appointments Commission and Related Matters'' page 81, section 5.24] (Accessed 27 May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July 2015, she was [[consecrated]] a bishop by [[Justin Welby]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], during a ceremony at [[Canterbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consecrations - Bishops of Gloucester and Crediton|url=http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/diary.php/5162/consecrations-bishops-of-gloucester-and-crediton|website=Archbishop's diary|publisher=Archbishop of Canterbury|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and Sarah Mullally (later [[Bishop of London]]) were the first women to be ordained as bishops at Canterbury Cathedral.&lt;ref name="anglicannews1"&gt;[http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2015/07/first-female-diocesan-bishop-in-c-of-e-consecrated.aspx First female diocesan bishop in C of E consecrated].

Following the [[Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015]], she was to become the first woman to enter the [[House of Lords]] as a bishop and [[Lords Spiritual|Lord Spiritual]] as soon as a Lord Spiritual seat was emptied.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph - Church of England names first female bishop to sit in the House of Lords" /&gt; She became eligible to take her seat when parliament reconvened in September 2015 after its summer recess and took the seat vacated by [[Tim Stevens]] (former [[Bishop of Leicester]] and Convenor of the Bishops in the Lords).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |title=Freedom of Religion and Belief |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201516/ldhansrd/text/150716-0003.htm#15071639000933 |house=House of Lords |date=16 July 2015 |column_start=779 |column_end=780 |speaker=The Lord Bishop of Leicester (Valedictory Speech) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Lords Recess dates|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-lords-faqs/lords-recess-dates/|website=House of Lords FAQs|publisher=Parliament.co.uk|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sent back the first version of her [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|writ of summons]] because it referred to her as a “right reverend father in God”&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|title='God is neither male nor female', says first female bishop to sit in the House of Lords|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/24/bishop-rachel-treweek-gods-not-a-he-or-a-she|website=The Guardian|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (bishops' writs have simply omitted “father in God” ever since — even for male bishops).&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/f00c828a-08d0-49f0-8c2d-9291ef5f1701?in=11:04:28 Chris Lincoln] &amp;amp; [https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/ccbc3621-f877-4a9e-bab9-b8beb97df00b?in=14:37:23 Martin Chichester]&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 2015, she was [[Introduction (House of Lords)|introduced to the House]] by Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, and [[Richard Chartres]], Bishop of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Future business: Monday 26 October at 2.30pm|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201516/minutes/150917/ldordpap.htm|website=House of Lords Business|publisher=Parliament.uk|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gloucester bishop Rachel Treweek to take seat in Lords|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34634819|website=BBC News|accessdate=26 October 2015|date=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
Treweek believes that [[God in Christianity|God]] should be considered to be [[Gender of God in Christianity|neither male nor female]] and tries to avoid using gender-specific pronouns when referring to God.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; Explaining this view, "she said she personally prefers to say neither "he" nor "she", but "God".

==Personal life==
In 2006, Rachel married Guy Treweek; he is a Church of England priest and was [[priest-in-charge]] of two parishes in the [[City of London]] at the time of her appointment to the episcopate.&lt;ref name="Guardian - Church of England appoints most senior female bishop"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caroline|first1=Davies|title=Church of England appoints most senior female bishop|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/26/church-england-senior-female-bishop-rachel-treweek-gloucester-lord-spiritual|accessdate=26 March 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
On 8 July 2016, Treweek was awarded an [[Honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Letters]] (DLitt) degree by the [[University of Reading]], her ''[[alma mater]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneering leadership: Rt Revd Rachel Treweek awarded honorary degree|url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR682106.aspx|website=University of Reading|accessdate=25 July 2016|date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10480">In [[mathematics]], the '''Sato–Tate conjecture''' is a [[statistical]] statement about the family of [[elliptic curve]]s ''E&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' over the [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements, with ''p'' a [[prime number]], obtained from an elliptic curve ''E'' over the [[rational number]] field, by the process of [[reduction modulo a prime]] for [[almost all]] ''p''. If ''N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the number of points on ''E&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' and defined over the field with ''p'' elements, the conjecture gives an answer to the distribution of the second-order term for ''N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''. That is, by [[Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves]] we have

:&lt;math&gt;N_p/p = 1 + \mathcal{O}\left(1\left/\sqrt{p}\right.\right)\ &lt;/math&gt;

as ''p'' → ∞, and the point of the conjecture is to predict how the [[big-O notation|O-term]] varies.

==Statement==
Let ''E'' be an elliptic curve defined over the rationals numbers without [[complex multiplication]].  Define ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; as the solution to the equation

:&lt;math&gt; p+1-N_p=2\sqrt{p}\cos{\theta_p} ~~ (0\leq \theta_p \leq \pi).&lt;/math&gt;

Then, for every two real numbers  
&lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; for which 
&lt;math&gt; 0\leq \alpha &lt; \beta \leq \pi &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{\#\{p\leq N:\alpha\leq \theta_p \leq \beta\}}
{\#\{p\leq N\}}=\frac{2}{\pi}  \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \sin^2 \theta \, d\theta.  &lt;/math&gt;

==Details==
By [[Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves]], the ratio

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{((p + 1)-N_p)}{2\sqrt{p}}=:\frac{a_p}{2\sqrt{p}} &lt;/math&gt;

is between -1 and 1. Thus it can be expressed as cos&amp;nbsp;''θ'' for an angle ''θ''; in geometric terms there are two [[eigenvalues]] accounting for the remainder and with the denominator as given they are [[complex conjugate]] and of [[absolute value]]&amp;nbsp;1. The ''Sato–Tate conjecture'', when ''E'' doesn't have complex multiplication,&lt;ref&gt;In the case of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication, the [[Hasse–Weil L-function]] is expressed in terms of a [[Hecke character|Hecke L-function]] (a result of [[Max Deuring]]). The known analytic results on these answer even more precise questions.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the [[probability measure]] of ''θ'' is proportional to

:&lt;math&gt;\sin^2 \theta \, d\theta.\ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To normalise, put 2/''&amp;pi;'' in front.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is due to [[Mikio Sato]] and [[John Tate]] (independently, and around 1960, published somewhat later).&lt;ref&gt;It is mentioned in J. Tate, ''Algebraic cycles and poles of zeta functions'' in the volume (O. F. G. Schilling, editor), ''Arithmetical Algebraic Geometry'', pages 93–110 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; It is by now supported by very substantial evidence.{{cn|date=February 2018|reason=Also, what kind of evidence?}}

==Proofs and claims in progress==
In 2008, [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]], joint with [[Laurent Clozel]], [[Michael Harris (mathematician)|Michael Harris]], and [[Nicholas Shepherd-Barron]], published a proof of the Sato–Tate conjecture for elliptic curves over [[totally real field]]s satisfying a certain condition: of having multiplicative reduction at some prime,&lt;ref&gt;That is, for some ''p'' where ''E'' has [[bad reduction]] (and at least for elliptic curves over the rational numbers there are some such ''p''), the type in the singular fibre of the [[Néron model]] is multiplicative, rather than additive. In practice this is the typical case, so the condition can be thought of as mild. In more classical terms, the result applies where the [[j-invariant]] is not integral.&lt;/ref&gt; in a series of three papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Further results are conditional on improved forms of the [[Arthur–Selberg trace formula]].

==Generalisation==
There are generalisations, involving the distribution of [[Frobenius element]]s in [[Galois group]]s involved in the [[Galois representation]]s on [[étale cohomology]]. In particular there is a conjectural theory for curves of genus&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

Under the random matrix model developed by [[Nick Katz]] and [[Peter Sarnak]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Random matrices, Frobenius Eigenvalues, and Monodromy |first=Nicholas M. |last=Katz |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Peter |last2=Sarnak |location=Providence, RI |publisher=American Mathematical Society |year=1999 |isbn=0-8218-1017-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is a conjectural correspondence between (unitarized) characteristic polynomials of Frobenius elements and [[conjugacy class]]es in the [[compact Lie group]] USp(2''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[Sp(n)|Sp(''n'')]].  The [[Haar measure]] on USp(2''n'') then gives the conjectured distribution, and the classical case is USp(2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[SU(2)]].

==More precise questions==
There are also more refined statements. The '''Lang–Trotter conjecture''' (1976) of [[Serge Lang]] and [[Hale Trotter]] predicts the asymptotic number of primes ''p'' with a given value of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lang |first=Serge |last2=Trotter |first2=Hale F. |year=1976 |title=Frobenius Distributions in GL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extensions |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=0-387-07550-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; the trace of Frobenius that appears in the formula. For the typical case (no [[complex multiplication]], trace ≠ 0) their formula states that the number of ''p'' up to ''X'' is asymptotically

:&lt;math&gt;c \sqrt{X}/ \log X\ &lt;/math&gt;

with a specified constant ''c''. [[Neal Koblitz]] (1988) provided detailed conjectures for the case of a prime number ''q'' of points on ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, motivated by [[elliptic curve cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Koblitz |first=Neal |year=1988 |title=Primality of the number of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field |journal=Pacific Journal of Mathematics |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=157–165 |mr=0917870 |doi=10.2140/pjm.1988.131.157}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999, [[Chantal David]] and [[Francesco Pappalardi]] proved that the Lang–Trotter conjecture holds in most cases.&lt;ref name="david-pappalardi"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cms.math.ca/MediaReleases/2013/kn-prize.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201044745/https://cms.math.ca/MediaReleases/2013/kn-prize.html |archivedate=2017-02-01 |date=2013-04-15 |title=Concordia Mathematician Recognized for Research Excellence |access-date=2018-01-15 |work=[[Canadian Mathematical Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28300">{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], a '''sign''' is anything that [[communicate|communicates]] a [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] that is not the sign itself to the interpreter of the sign. The meaning can be intentional such as a word uttered with a specific meaning, or unintentional, such as a [[symptom]] being a sign of a particular medical condition. Signs can communicate through any of the [[senses]], visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or taste.

Two major theories describe the way signs acquire the ability to transfer information. Both theories understand the defining property of the sign as a relation between a number of elements. In the tradition of semiotics developed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (referred to as semiology) the sign relation is dyadic, consisting only of a form of the sign (the signifier) and its meaning (the signified). Saussure saw this relation as being essentially arbitrary (the principle of '''semiotic arbitrariness'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), motivated only by social convention. Saussure's theory has been particularly influential in the study of linguistic signs. The other major [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs|semiotic theory]], developed by [[C. S. Peirce]], defines the sign as a triadic relation as "something that stands for something, to someone in some capacity"&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Danesi]] and Paul Perron, ''Analyzing Cultures''.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a sign is a relation between the sign vehicle (the specific physical form of the sign), a sign object (the aspect of the world that the sign carries meaning about) and an interpretant (the meaning of the sign as understood by an interpreter). According to Peirce signs can be divided by the type of relation that holds the sign relation together as either [[icon]]s, indices or [[symbols]]. Icons are those signs that signify by means of similarity between sign vehicle and sign object (e.g. a portrait, or a map), indices are those that signify by means of a direct relation of contiguity or causality between sign vehicle and sign object (e.g. a symptom), and symbols are those that signify through a law or arbitrary social convention.

==Dyadic signs==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Intension]] --&gt;
According to [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857–1913), a sign is composed of the ''signifier''&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;Mardy S. Ireland defines a signifier as:&lt;br&gt;A unit of something (i.e., a word, gesture) that can carry ambiguous/multiple meanings (e.g., as U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] once said, "It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is', is")&lt;br&gt;{{cite book

}} p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; (''signifiant''), and the ''signified'' (''signifié''). These cannot be conceptualized as separate entities but rather as a mapping from significant differences in sound to potential (correct) differential denotation. The Saussurean sign exists only at the level of the [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] system, in which signs are defined by their relative and hierarchical privileges of co-occurrence. It is thus a common misreading of Saussure to take signifiers to be anything one could speak, and signifieds as things in the world. In fact, the relationship of language to [[langue and parole|parole]] (or speech-in-context) is and always has been a theoretical problem for linguistics (cf. Roman Jakobson's famous essay "Closing Statement: Linguistics and Poetics" et al.).

A famous thesis by Saussure states that the relationship between a sign and the real-world thing it denotes is an arbitrary one. There is not a natural relationship between a word and the object it refers to, nor is there a causal relationship between the inherent properties of the object and the nature of the sign used to denote it. For example, there is nothing about the physical quality of paper that requires denotation by the phonological sequence ‘paper’. There is, however, what Saussure called ‘relative motivation’: the possibilities of signification of a signifier are constrained by the [[compositionality]] of elements in the linguistic system (cf. [[Emile Benveniste]]'s paper on the arbitrariness of the sign in the first volume of his papers on general linguistics).  In other words, a word is only available to acquire a new meaning if it is identifiably ''different'' from all the other words in the language and it has no existing meaning. [[Structuralism]] was later based on this idea that it is only within a given system that one can define the distinction between the levels of system and use, or the semantic "value" of a sign.

==Triadic signs==
[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) proposed a different theory. Unlike Saussure who approached the conceptual question from a study of [[linguistics]] and [[phonology]], Peirce, the so-called father of the [[Pragmaticism|Pragmatist school]] of philosophy, extended the concept of sign to embrace many other forms. He considered "word" to be only one particular kind of sign, and characterized sign as any mediational means to [[understanding]]. He covered not only artificial, linguistic, and symbolic signs, but also all semblances (such as kindred sensible qualities), and all indicators (such as mechanical reactions). He counted as symbols all terms, propositions, and arguments whose interpretation is based upon convention or habit, even apart from their expression in particular languages. He held that "all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., ''Collected Papers'', v. 5, paragraph 448 footnote, from "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; The setting of Peirce's study of signs is philosophical logic, which he defined as formal semiotic,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., 1902, Application to the Carnegie Institution, Memoir 12, "On the Definition of Logic", [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-05.htm#m12 Eprint]. Note that by "logic" Peirce means a part of philosophy, not the mathematics of logic. (See [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and characterized as a normative field following esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics,&lt;ref&gt;On his classifications, see Peirce, C.S. (1903), ''Collected Peirce'' v. 1, paragraphs 180–202 [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm Eprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105121054/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm |date=2011-11-05 }} and (1906) "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 372–3. For relevant quotes, see "Philosophy" and "Logic" in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and as the art of devising methods of research.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., 1882, "Introductory Lecture on the Study of Logic" delivered September 1882, ''Johns Hopkins University Circulars'', v. 2, n. 19, pp. 11–12, November 1892, ''Google Book'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0YFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22art+of+devising+methods+of+research%22 Eprint]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraphs 59–76, ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 210–14, and ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' v. 4, pp. 378–82.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs,&lt;ref name=QCCF&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1868), "Questions concerning certain Faculties claimed for Man" (''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/question/qu-frame.htm Eprint]), ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' vol. 2, pp. 103–114. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 213–63.&lt;/ref&gt; that all thought has the form of inference (even when not conscious and deliberate),&lt;ref name=QCCF/&gt; and that, as inference, "logic is rooted in the social principle", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1878) "The Doctrine of Chances", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 604–15, 1878, reprinted in ''Collected Papers'', v. 2, paragraphs 645–68, ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' v. 3, pp. 276–90, and ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 142–54. "...death makes the number of our risks, the number of our inferences, finite, and so makes their mean result uncertain. The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. .... ...logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall not be limited. .... Logic is rooted in the social principle."&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a theory not of language in particular, but rather of the production of meaning, and it rejects the idea of a static relationship between a sign and what it represents: its ''object''. Peirce believed that signs are meaningful through recursive relationships that arise in sets of three.

Even when a sign represents by a resemblance or factual connection independent of interpretation, the sign is a sign only insofar as it is at least potentially interpretable by a mind and insofar as the sign is a determination of a mind or at least a ''quasi-mind'', that functions as if it were a mind, for example in crystals and the work of bees&lt;ref&gt;See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/quasimind.html Quasi-mind]" in the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt;—the focus here is on sign action in general, not on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields Peirce also pursued).

A sign depends on an object in a way that enables (and, in a sense, determines) an interpretation, an ''interpretant'', to depend on the object ''as the sign depends on the object''. The interpretant, then, is a further sign of the object, and thus enables and determines still further interpretations, further interpretant signs. The process, called ''[[semiosis]]'', is irreducibly triadic, Peirce held, and is logically structured to perpetuate itself. It is what defines sign, object, and interpretant in general.&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of ''sign'' and ''semiosis'', see under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/sign.html Sign]" and "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/semiosis.html Semiosis, semeiosy]" in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''; and "[http://perso.numericable.fr/robert.marty/semiotique/access.htm 76 definitions of sign by C. S. Peirce]" collected by Robert Marty. Peirce's "[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/ep/ep2/ep2book/ch02/ep2ch2.htm What Is a Sign]" (MS 404 of 1894, ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 4–10) provides intuitive help.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (1990: 7) put it, "the process of referring effected by the sign is ''infinite''." (Note also that Peirce used the word "determine" in the sense not of strict determinism, but of effectiveness that can vary like an influence.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Peirce said "determined (i.e., specialized, ''bestimmt'')" in a letter to William James, dated 1909, see p. 492 in ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Peirce further characterized the three [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)|semiotic elements]] as follows:&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of ''immediate object'' and the rest, see the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Sign'' (or ''representamen''&lt;ref&gt;Pronounced with the “a” long and stressed: {{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|ɛ|p|r|ᵻ|z|ɛ|n|ˈ|t|eɪ|m|ə|n}}. See [[wiktionary:representamen]].&lt;/ref&gt;): that which represents the denoted object (cf. Saussure's "signifier").
# ''Object'' (or ''semiotic object''): that which the sign represents (or as some put it, [[Encode (semiotics)|encodes]]). It can be anything thinkable, a law, a fact, or even a possibility (a semiotic object could even be fictional, such as [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]); those are partial objects; the total object is the [[universe of discourse]], the totality of objects in that world to which one attributes the partial object. For example, perturbation of Pluto's orbit is a sign about Pluto, but not only about Pluto. The object may be
## ''immediate'' to the sign, the object as represented in the sign, or
## ''dynamic'', the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded.
# ''Interpretant'' (or ''interpretant sign''): a sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a further sign by interpreting (or, as some put it, [[Decode (semiotics)|decoding]]) the sign. The interpretant may be:
##''immediate'' to the sign, a kind of possibility, all that the sign is suited to immediately express, for instance a word's usual meaning;
##''dynamic'', that is, the meaning as formed into an actual effect, for example an individual translation or a state of agitation, or
##''final'' or ''normal'', that is, the ultimate meaning that inquiry taken far enough would be destined to reach. It is a kind of norm or ideal end, with which an actual interpretant may, at most, coincide.

Peirce explained that signs mediate between their objects and their interpretants in semiosis, the triadic process of determination. In semiosis a ''first'' is determined or influenced to be a sign by a ''second'', as its object. The object determines the sign to determine a ''third'' as an interpretant. ''Firstness'' itself is one of [[Categories (Peirce)|Peirce's three categories of all phenomena]], and is quality of feeling. Firstness is associated with a vague state of mind as feeling and a sense of the possibilities, with neither compulsion nor reflection. In semiosis the mind discerns an appearance or phenomenon, a potential sign. ''Secondness'' is reaction or resistance, a category associated with moving from possibility to determinate actuality. Here, through experience outside of and collateral to the given sign or sign system, one recalls or discovers the object the sign refers to, for example when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent but remembered object. It is through one's collateral experience&lt;ref&gt;In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms. See pp. 404–9 in "Pragmatism" in ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2. Ten quotes on collateral experience from Peirce provided by [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph Ransdell]] can be viewed [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=57101 here] at peirce-l's Lyris archive.&lt;/ref&gt; that the object determines the sign to determine an interpretant. ''Thirdness'' is representation or mediation, the category associated with signs, generality, rule, continuity, habit-taking, and purpose. Here one forms an interpretant expressing a meaning or ramification of the sign about the object. When a second sign is considered, the initial interpretant may be confirmed, or new possible meanings may be identified. As each new sign is addressed, more interpretants, themselves signs, emerge. It can involve a mind's reading of nature, people, mathematics, anything.

Peirce generalized the communicational idea of utterance and interpretation of a sign, to cover all signs:&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1906), "Prolegomena To an Apology For Pragmaticism", ''[[The Monist]]'', v. XVI, n. 4, pp. 492–546, see pp. 523–4, ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA523 Eprint]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 4, paragraphs 530–72, see 551.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Admitting that connected Signs must have a Quasi-mind, it may further be declared that there can be no isolated sign. Moreover, signs require at least two Quasi-minds; a ''Quasi-utterer'' and a'' Quasi-interpreter''; and although these two are at one (i.e., are one mind) in the sign itself, they must nevertheless be distinct. In the Sign they are, so to say, ''welded''. Accordingly, it is not merely a fact of human Psychology, but a necessity of Logic, that every logical evolution of thought should be dialogic.}}

According to Nattiez, writing with [[Jean Molino]], the tripartite definition of sign, object, and interpretant is based on the "[[Trace (semiology)|trace]]" or [[neutral level]], Saussure's "sound-image" (or "signified", thus Peirce's "representamen"). Thus, "a symbolic form...is not some 'intermediary' in a process of 'communication' that transmits the meaning intended by the author to the audience; it is instead the result of a complex ''process'' of creation (the [[poietic]] process) that has to do with the form as well as the content of the work; it is also the point of departure for a complex process of reception (the ''esthesic'' process that ''reconstructs'' a 'message'").
(ibid, p.&amp;nbsp;17)

Peirce's theory of the sign therefore offered a powerful analysis of the signification system, its codes, and its processes of inference and learning—because the focus was often on natural or cultural context rather than linguistics, which only analyses usage in slow-time whereas human semiotic interaction in the real world often has a chaotic blur of language and signal exchange. Nevertheless, the implication that triadic relations are structured to perpetuate themselves leads to a level of complexity not usually experienced in the routine of message creation and interpretation. Hence, different ways of expressing the idea have developed.

===Classes of triadic signs===
By 1903&lt;ref name=9signs/&gt; Peirce came to [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)|classify signs]] by three universal trichotomies dependent on his three categories (quality, fact, habit). He classified any sign:&lt;ref&gt;For more as to the definitions, terminology, and development of the classifications, see the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''&lt;/ref&gt; 
# by what stands as the sign — either (''qualisign'', also called a ''tone'') a quality — or (''sinsign'', also called ''token'') an individual fact — or (''legisign'', also called ''type'') a rule, a habit;
# by how the sign stands for its object — either (''icon'') by its own quality, such that it resembles the object, regardless of factual connection and of interpretive rule of reference — or (''index'') by factual connection to its object, regardless of resemblance and of interpretive rule of reference — or (''symbol'') by rule or habit of interpreted reference to its object, regardless of resemblance and of factual connection; and
# by how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant — either (''rheme'', also called ''seme'',&lt;ref&gt;In 1902 Peirce used the word "seme" instead for an index, especially an indexical sinsign. See ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraph 283.&lt;/ref&gt; such as a term) as regards quality or possibility, as if the sign were a qualisign, though it can be qualisign, sinsign, or legisign — or (''dicisign'', also called ''pheme'', such as a proposition) as regards fact, as if the sign were an index, though it can be index or symbol — or (''argument'', also called ''delome''&lt;ref&gt;Peirce said, "pronounce deeloam, from ''δήλωμα''", Peirce (1906), "Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmaticism", The Monist, v. 16, n. 4, pp. 492–546, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA507 507]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 4, paragraphs 530–572, see 538. [http://www.existentialgraphs.com/peirceoneg/prolegomena.htm Eprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905164710/http://www.existentialgraphs.com/peirceoneg/prolegomena.htm |date=2007-09-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;) as regards rule or habit. This is the trichotomy of all signs as building blocks in an inference process.
* Any qualisign is an icon. Sinsigns include some icons and some indices. Legisigns include some icons, some indices, and all symbols.
* Any icon is a rheme. Indices (be they sinsigns or legisigns) include some rhemes and some dicisigns. Symbols include some rhemes, some dicisigns, and all arguments.
{{C. S. Peirce ninefold sign table}}
Because of those classificatory interdependences, the three trichotomies intersect to form ten (rather than 27) classes of signs. There are also various kinds of meaningful combination. Signs can be attached to one another. A photograph is an index with a meaningfully attached icon. Arguments are composed of dicisigns, and dicisigns are composed of rhemes. In order to be embodied, legisigns (types) need sinsigns (tokens) as their individual replicas or instances. A symbol depends as a sign on how it ''will'' be interpreted, regardless of resemblance or factual connection to its object; but the symbol's individual embodiment is an index to your experience of the object. A symbol is instanced by a specialized indexical sinsign. A symbol such as a sentence in a language prescribes qualities of appearance for its instances, and is itself a replica of a symbol such as a proposition apart from expression in a particular language. Peirce covered both semantic and syntactical issues in his theoretical grammar, as he sometimes called it. He regarded formal semiotic, as logic, as furthermore encompassing study of arguments ([[Abductive reasoning|hypothetical]], [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]) and inquiry's methods including [[pragmatism]]; and as allied to but distinct from logic's pure mathematics.

Peirce sometimes referred to the “ground” of a sign. The ground is the pure abstraction of a quality.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1867), "[[s:On a New List of Categories|On a New List of Categories]]", ''Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'', v. 7 (1868), pp. 287–98. (Delivered orally by Peirce in 1867 and distributed by him in 1867 as part of an extract).&lt;/ref&gt; A sign's ground is the ''respect'' in which the sign represents its object, e.g. as in [[literal and figurative language]]. For example, an icon ''presents'' a characteristic or quality attributed to an object, while a symbol ''imputes'' to an object a quality either presented by an icon or symbolized so as to evoke a mental icon.

Peirce called an icon apart from a label, legend, or other index attached to it, a "hypoicon", and divided the hypoicon into three classes: (a) the ''image'', which depends on a simple quality; (b) the ''diagram'', whose internal relations, mainly dyadic or so taken, represent by analogy the relations in something; and (c) the ''metaphor'', which represents the representative character of a sign by representing a parallelism in something else.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 276–7, written circa 1902. See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/diagram.html Diagram]" in the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; A diagram can be geometric, or can consist in an array of algebraic expressions, or even in the common form "All __ is ___" which is subjectable, like any diagram, to logical or mathematical transformations. Peirce held that mathematics is done by diagrammatic thinking — observation of, and experimentation on, diagrams. Peirce developed for deductive logic a system of visual [[existential graph]]s, which continue to be researched today.

==20th-century theories==
It is now agreed that the effectiveness of the acts that may convert the message into text (including speaking, writing, drawing, music and physical movements) depends upon ''the knowledge of the sender''. If the sender is not familiar with the current language, its codes and its culture, then he or she will not be able to say anything at all, whether as a visitor in a different language area or because of a medical condition such as [[aphasia]] (see [[Roman Jakobson]]).

Modern theories deny the [[Saussure|Saussurian]] distinction between signifier and signified&lt;!--implicit in SD--&gt;, and look for meaning not in the individual signs, but in their context and the framework of potential meanings that could be applied. Such theories assert that language is a collective memory or cultural history of all the different ways in which meaning has been communicated, and may to that extent, constitute all life's experiences (see [[Louis Hjelmslev]]). Hjelmslev did not consider the sign to be the smallest [[semiotic]] unit, as he believed it possible to decompose it further; instead, he considered the "internal structure of language" to be a system of ''[[figurae]]'', a concept somewhat related to that of [[figure of speech]],&lt;!--cites follow--&gt; which he considered to be the ultimate semiotic unity.&lt;ref name="Hjelmslev43"&gt;Hjelmslev [1943] ''[[Prolegomena]] to a Theory of Language'', pp.47, 65, 67, and cf. 6.26, 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beaugrande91"&gt;[[Robert de Beaugrande]] (1991) ''[Linguistic Theory: The Discourse of  Fundamental Works]'', section on [http://www.beaugrande.com/LINGTHERHjelmslev.htm Louis Hjelmslev].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noth90"&gt;[[Nöth, Winfried]] (1990) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rHA4KQcPeNgC Handbook of semiotics]'', pp.66, 70-1 section 3&lt;/ref&gt;

This position implies that speaking is simply one more form of behaviour and changes the focus of attention from the text as language, to the text as a [[Knowledge representation|representation]] of purpose, a functional version of the [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]]. But, once the message has been transmitted, the text exists independently.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Hence, although the writers who co-operated to produce this page exist, they can only be represented by the signs actually selected and presented here. The interpretation process in the receiver's mind may attribute meanings completely different from those intended by the senders. But, why might this happen? Neither the sender nor the receiver of a text has a perfect grasp of all language. Each individual's relatively small ''stock'' of knowledge is the product of personal experience and their attitude to learning. When the [[audience]] receives the message, there will always be an excess of connotational meanings available to be applied to the particular signs in their context (no matter how relatively complete or incomplete their knowledge, the [[cognitive]] process is the same).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The first stage in understanding the message is therefore, to suspend or defer judgement until more information becomes available. At some point, the individual receiver decides which of all possible meanings represents the best possible fit. Sometimes, uncertainty may not be resolved, so meaning is indefinitely deferred, or a provisional or approximate meaning is allocated. More often, the receiver's desire for [[Closure (psychology)|closure]] (see [[Gestalt psychology]]) leads to simple meanings being attributed out of prejudices and without reference to the sender's intentions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Postmodern theory==
In [[critical theory]], the notion of sign is used variously. 

{{Quote|Many postmodernist theorists postulate a complete disconnection of the signifier and the signified. An [[Floating signifier|'empty' or 'floating signifier']] is variously defined as a signifier with a vague, highly variable, unspecifiable or non-existent signified. Such signifiers mean different things to different people: they may stand for many or even any signifieds; they may mean whatever their interpreters want them to mean.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Chandler, ''Semiotics: The Basics'', Routledge 2007, page 78&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Danny Lambert.jpg|thumb|Man soapboxing in [[Speakers' Corner]], [[Hyde Park, London]]]]
A '''soapbox''' is a raised platform on which one stands to make an [[wiktionary:impromptu|impromptu]] speech, often about a [[Politics|political]] subject. The term originates from the days when speakers would elevate themselves by standing on a wooden [[crate]] originally used for shipment of [[soap]] or other dry goods from a manufacturer to a retail store.

The term is also used [[metaphor]]ically to describe a person engaging in often flamboyant impromptu or unofficial [[public speaking]], as in the phrases "He's on his soapbox", or "Get off your soapbox." [[Hyde Park, London]] is known for its Sunday soapbox orators, who have assembled at [[Speakers' Corner]] since 1872 to discuss [[religion]], [[politics]], and [[Controversy#See also|other topics]]. [[Blogs]] can be used as soapboxes within the context of the [[World Wide Web]].
==History==

===Origins of the term===

Throughout the 19th Century and into the 20th, prior to the invention of [[corrugated fiberboard]], manufacturers used wooden crates for the shipment of wholesale merchandise to retail establishments. Discarded containers of every size, well-constructed and sturdy, were readily available in most towns. These "soapboxes" made free and easily portable temporary platforms for street corner speakers attempting to be seen and heard at improvised "outdoor meetings," to which passersby would gather to hear often provocative speeches on religious or political themes.

The decades immediately preceding [[World War I]] have been called the "Golden Age of Soapbox Oratory."&lt;ref name="Challinor36"&gt;Raymond Challinor, ''The Origins of British Bolshevism.'' London: Croom Helm, 1977; pg. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Working people had little money to spend and tub-thumping public speakers pushing their social or political agendas provided a form of mass entertainment.&lt;ref name="Challinor36" /&gt; Radical political parties, intent on bringing what they perceived as an emancipatory message to the [[working class]], were particularly intent upon making use of "street meetings," with their speeches and [[pamphlet|leaflets]], to advance their specific message.

[[File:Crowd of Socialists, New York City, October 16, 1908.jpg|thumb|American [[political activist]]s considered soapboxing a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right. Law enforcement authorities frequently viewed it as an impediment to the public [[Right of way (public throughway)|right-of-way]] (New York City, October 1908).]]

Street-corner oratory could also present its share of problems. Chief among these was the policy of local law enforcement authorities, who sometimes saw in [[Political radicalism|radical]] political discourse a form of [[incitement]] to crime and violence and a threat to [[public order]]. Additionally, large street corner crowds listening to "soapboxers" would often obstruct public walkways or spill into public streets, creating inconveniences to pedestrians or vehicular traffic alike. Consequently, local authorities would often attempt to restrict public oratory through [[license|licensing]] or [[Ban (law)|prescriptive banning]].

This conflict between dedicated political or religious partisans, on the one hand, and civil authorities intent upon the maintenance of public order, on the other, made soapboxing a matter of frequent public contention. Throughout its history, soapboxing has been tied to the [[Freedom of speech|right to speak]]. From the period 1907 to approximately 1916, the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] conducted dozens of [[free speech fights]] in the United States, particularly in the West and the Northwest, in order to protect or reclaim their right to soapbox. Many prominent [[socialists]] and other radicals cut their political teeth in these or similar free speech fights, including [[Seattle]] newspaper publisher [[Hermon Titus]], [[Socialist Party of Washington]] leaders [[Alfred Wagenknecht]] and [[L.E. Katterfeld]], IWW activist [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], and prominent [[syndicalist]] [[William Z. Foster]].

Additional problems could be presented to street corner orators from rival political groups or [[hecklers]].&lt;ref name="Challinor37"&gt;Challinor, ''The Origins of British Bolshevism,'' pg. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; A skilled and effective "soapboxer" had to be quick on his feet, figuratively and sometimes literally, having the ability to express political opinions with clarity, to have ready answers for common objections, to be able to deflect hostility with humor or satire, and to be able to face difficulty or danger with fortitude. Soapboxing proved to be what one historian has called "a hard, but nevertheless necessary, process in the development of revolutionary leaders."&lt;ref name="Challinor37" /&gt;

===Contemporary soapboxing===

During the 1960s, a [[Free Speech Movement]] was initiated on the [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley, California Campus]] over fund-raising at an intersection and other political freedoms, and the fight eventually spread to other college campuses across the United States.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 UK General Election]], the Conservative Party were widely expected to be defeated by [[Neil Kinnock]]'s Labour Party. Tory leader [[John Major]] took his campaign into the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned soapbox. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to [[taxation]]. Major won in excess of 14 million votes, the highest popular vote for a political party in a British general election.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4843">'''Solomon Ettinger''' (1802–1856) was a 19th-century [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]- and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew-language]] playwright, poet and writer of songs and fables whose emblematic play ''Serkele'' has remained a classic of the [[Yiddish theatre]]. His given name has appeared variously as '''Salomon''' or '''Shlomo''' or '''Shloyme''' and his family name has also been rendered as '''Ettingher'''.

Ettinger was born in [[Warsaw]]; after being orphaned at an early age, he was raised in [[Łęczna]] by a paternal uncle,&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;Berger, Jack S.; Schulman, Elias. "Solomon Ettinger." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. 2nd ed. Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. Retrieved via ''Biography in Context'' database, 2017-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Mendel Ettinger, a [[rabbi]] who was proficient in German, and open to allowing his nephew to explore aspects of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as part of his education.&lt;ref name="Dauber"&gt;Dauber, Jeremy (August&amp;nbsp;6, 2010). "[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Ettinger_Shloyme Ettinger, Shloyme]." ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''. yivoencyclopedia.org. Retrieved 2017-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the age of 15, Solomon Ettinger entered into an arranged marriage with Golda, the daughter of magnate Judah Leib Wolf, of [[Zamość]].&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dauber"/&gt; The young couple moved to Zamość, and lived with Golda's parents.&lt;ref name="Dauber"/&gt; There Ettinger came under the influence of the [[Haskalah]], the Jewish Enlightenment movement.&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt;

By 1795, [[Poland]] had been [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned]] between [[Prussia]], [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]]. Zamość was in the Austrian partition, but the residents spoke primarily [[Polish language|Polish]] and the Zamość had a large Jewish population.

Eventually, he traveled to the big town of the Austrian partition, the primarily Polish-[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] city of [[Lviv]] (then often known as [[Lemberg]]), to study medicine at its renowned [[Lviv University|University]]. After years of learning, he graduated with a medical degree and returned to his native region, but was unable to practice as a physician. By 1832 the city of Zamość, where Ettinger now lived, had been incorporated into the Russian partition, the most intolerant of the three. Anti-Jewish [[pogroms]] were frequent and Ettinger's degree was declared invalid, because it came from an ostensibly foreign institution.

After numerous attempts at other professions, including an unsuccessful period with an agricultural group, Ettinger settled in [[Odessa]], a Russian [[Black Sea]] port with a substantial number of Jewish residents, and attempted to make a living as a writer, while supplementing his income with various short-lived jobs. Much of what he has written is now [[Lost works| lost]], but his sketches, poetry and songs were published in various Yiddish-language periodicals of the time. His only surviving dramas are fragments of two plays ''Der Feter fun America'' (''The Uncle from America'') and ''Freleche Yungeleut'' (''Carefree Youth'') found after his death, and the play that keeps his name alive and is still performed by Yiddish theaters around the world, ''Serkele'' which, while written when Ettinger was in his twenties, and performed during his lifetime, was first published posthumously in 1861.

''Serkele'' is one of the most renowned plays in the entire repertoire of the Yiddish theater and owes its high reputation to its strong sense of form, sound and rhythm. The characters are delineated in a masterful style comparable to that of the most esteemed dramatists and its outlook remains alive and fresh after 180 years. The Yiddish linguistic stylization in ''Serkele'' and the two fragmentary plays is crisp and self-assured, displaying a mastery of the medium. Renowned Yiddish playwrights who flourished immediately after Ettinger, such as [[Abraham Goldfaden]] and [[Jacob Gordin]] have written how much they were influenced by ''Serkele''.

No clear details have emerged as to the circumstances of his death. Such writings of his that did survive were preserved by his family and published posthumously, in most cases, decades after their author's death.

The '''Temotu languages''', named after [[Temotu Province]] of the [[Solomon Islands]], are a branch of [[Oceanic languages]] proposed in Ross &amp; Næss 2007 for the [[Reefs – Santa Cruz languages]].

==History of classification==
These languages had previously been considered [[Papuan languages|Papuan]], but Ross &amp; Næss established that the closest relatives were the Utupua–Vanikoro languages, previously thought to be [[Central–Eastern Oceanic languages|Central–Eastern Oceanic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Ross, Malcolm]] and Åshild Næss | title= An Oceanic Origin for Äiwoo, the Language of the Reef Islands? | journal= Oceanic Linguistics | year= 2007 | volume= 46 | pages= 456–498 | doi=10.1353/ol.2008.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Roger Blench]] (2014)&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2014. ''[https://www.academia.edu/5838021/Lapita_canoes_and_their_multi-ethnic_crews_marginal_Austronesian_languages_are_non-Austronesian Lapita Canoes and Their Multi-Ethnic Crews: Might Marginal Austronesian Languages Be Non-Austronesian?]'' Paper presented at the Workshop on the Languages of Papua 3. 20-24 January 2014, Manokwari, West Papua, Indonesia.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the aberrancy of Utupua and Vanikoro, which he considers to be separate branches that do not group with each other, is due to the fact that they are actually non-Austronesian languages.

Blench (2014) doubts that Utupua and Vanikoro are closely related, and thus should not be grouped together. Since each of the three Utupua and three Vanikoro languages are highly distinct from each other, Blench doubts that these languages had diversified on the islands of Utupua and Vanikoro, but had rather migrated to the islands from elsewhere. According to Blench, historically this was due to the [[Lapita culture|Lapita]] demographic expansion consisting of both Austronesian and non-Austronesian settlers migrating from the Lapita homeland in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] to various islands further to the east.

&lt;!--{{original research|date=May 2011}}--&gt; 
'''Terminology''' is the study of terms and their use. '''Terms''' are [[word]]s and [[compound word]]s or multi-word expressions that in specific contexts are given specific meanings—these may deviate from the meanings the same words have in other contexts and in everyday language.{{clarify|date=June 2018|reason=An example and counterexample are needed.}}&lt;ref&gt;a word or expression that has a precise meaning in some uses or is peculiar to a science, art, profession, or subject.{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Term|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terminology is a discipline that studies, among other things, the development of such terms and their interrelationships within a specialized domain. Terminology differs from [[lexicography]], as it involves the study of [[concept]]s, conceptual systems and their labels (''terms''), whereas lexicography studies words and their meanings.

Terminology is a discipline that systematically studies the "labelling or designating of concepts" particular to one or more subject fields or domains of human activity. It does this through the research and analysis of terms in context for the purpose of documenting and promoting consistent usage. Terminology can be limited to one or more languages (for example, "multilingual terminology" and "bilingual terminology"), or may have an [[interdisciplinarity]] focus on the use of terms in different fields.

==Overview==
The discipline of terminology consists primarily of the following aspects:

* analyzing the concepts and concept structures used in a field or domain of activity
* identifying the terms assigned to the concepts
* in the case of bilingual or multilingual terminology, establishing correspondences between terms in the various languages
* compiling the [[terminology (artifact)|terminology]], on paper or in [[database]]s
* managing [[terminology database]]s
* creating new terms, as required.

==Types of terminology==
A distinction is made between two types of terminology work:
* '''Ad hoc work on terminology''', which deals with a single term or a limited number of terms
* '''Systematic collection of terminology''', which deals with all the terms in a specific subject field or domain of activity, often by creating a structured [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] of the terms within that domain and their interrelationships.

Ad hoc terminology is prevalent in the [[translation]] profession, where a translation for a specific term (or group of terms) is required quickly to solve a particular translation problem.

==Terminology as a discipline==
A ''terminologist'' intends to hone categorical organization by improving the accuracy and content of its terminology. Technical industries and [[standardization]] institutes compile their own glossaries.  This provides the consistency needed in the various areas&amp;mdash;fields and branches, movements and specialties&amp;mdash;to work with core terminology to then offer material for the discipline's traditional and doctrinal literature.

Terminology is also then key in boundary-crossing problems, such as in language translation and [[social epistemology]].
Terminology helps to build bridges and to extend one area into another. [[Translator]]s research the terminology of the languages they translate. Terminology is taught alongside translation in universities and translation schools. Large translation departments and translation bureaus have a ''Terminology'' section.

==Terminological theories==
Terminological theories include general theory of terminology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Thuringian''' is an [[East Central German]] dialect group spoken in much of the modern German Free State of [[Thuringia]] north of the [[Rennsteig]] ridge, southwestern [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and adjacent territories of [[Hesse]] and [[Bavaria]]. It is close to [[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]] spoken mainly in the state of [[Saxony]], therefore both are also regarded as one Thuringian-Upper Saxon dialect group. Thuringian dialects are among the Central German dialects with the highest number of speakers.

==History==
Thuringian emerged during the medieval German ''[[Ostsiedlung]]'' migration from about 1100, when settlers from [[Franconia]] ([[Main (river)|Main]] Franconia), [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], and [[Flanders]] settled in the areas east of the [[Saale]] River previously inhabited by [[Polabian Slavs]].

==Characteristics==
The Thuringian dialect is characterized by a rounding of the vowels, the weakening of consonants of Standard German (the lenition of the consonants "p," "t," and "k"), a marked difference in the pronunciation of the "g" sound (which is most common in the areas of North Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt areas), and a highly-idiosyncratic, melodic intonation of sentences. The second German consonant shift manifested itself in a manner different from that elsewhere in the areas that spoke High German. In many words, "b" is pronounced as "w" or "f" would be in Standard German. For example, the word "aber" (but) is pronounced as "awer". The Thuringian dialect has advanced beyond the stage of [[basilect]].

A '''traverse''' in [[trench warfare]] is an adaptation to reduce casualties to defenders occupying a trench. One form of traverse is a U-shaped detour in the trench with the trench going around a protrusion formed of earth and [[sandbag]]s. The [[Fragmentation (weaponry)#Difference between fragmentation and shrapnel|fragments or shrapnel]], or shockwave from a shell landing and exploding within a trench then cannot spread past the obstacle the traverse interposes. Also, an enemy that has entered a trench is unable to fire down the length at the defenders, or otherwise [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] the trench.

A traverse trench is a trench dug perpendicular to a trench line, but extending away from the enemy. It has two functions. One function is to provide an entry into the main trench. A second function is to provide a place for defenders to shelter and regroup should the enemy have penetrated into the main trench and be able to fire down the main trench's length.

On an approach trench, that is, a trench leading from the rear to the frontline or firing trench, defenders may construct an island traverse. With an island traverse, the approach trench splits to go around both sides of a traverse before coming together again. 

Lastly, a flying or bridge traverse is a sandbagged covering for a stretch of trench to block shrapnel or shell fragments from entering the trench.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20776">In syntax, '''verb-initial (V1) word order''' is a [[word order]] in which the verb appears before the subject and the object. In the more narrow sense, this term is used specifically to describe the word order of V1 languages (a V1 language being a language where the word order is obligatorily or predominantly verb-initial). V1 clauses only occur in V1 languages and other languages with a dominant V1 order displaying other properties that correlate with verb-initiality and that are crucial to many analyses of V1.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Clemens|first1 = Lauren Eby|last2 = Polinsky|first2 = Maria|title = Verb-initial word orders (primarily in Austronesian and Mayan languages)|journal = The Blackwell Companion to Syntax|date = 2015|url = http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mpolinsky/files/v1_syncom.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; V1 languages are estimated to make up 12-19% of the world’s languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomlin|first1=Russell|title=Basic Word Order: Functional Principles|date=1986|publisher=Croom Helm|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

V1 languages constitute a diverse group from different language families. They include [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Biu–Mandara languages|Biu-Mandara]], [[Surmic languages|Surmic]], and [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] languages in [[Africa]]; [[Celtic languages]] in Europe; [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], and [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] languages in [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]]; [[Salish language|Salish]], [[Wakashan languages|Wakashan]], and [[Tsimshianic languages|Tsimshiani]] languages in [[North America]]; [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]] languages in [[South America]]; [[Austronesian languages]] in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some languages are strictly [[Verb-Subject-Object word order|VSO]], for example [[Q’anjob’al language|Q’anjob’al]] (Mayan). Others are strictly [[Verb–object–subject|VOS]], for example [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] (Austronesian). Many alternate between VSO and VOS, an example being [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] (Algonquian).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Word-order correlations ==

Verb-initial languages pattern with SVO languages on many of their word orders. The similarity between the word orders typical for both verb-initial languages and SVO languages has led many typologists to refer to all of these languages as simply VO. According to [[Matthew Dryer]]’s 1992 study of a worldwide sample of languages, the majority of VO languages (of which verb-initial languages are a subtype) have the following word order tendencies:

Strong tendencies:

*Adjective comes before standard of comparison
*Verb comes before adpositional phrase
*Adpositions come before the noun phrase (i.e. they are prepositions)
*Verb comes before manner adverb
*Copula comes before nominal or adjectival predicate
*Auxiliary comes before verb (for those languages that have auxiliaries)
*Negative auxiliary comes before verb (for those languages that have negative auxiliaries)
*Complementizer comes before S
*Adverbial subordinator comes before S

Weak tendencies:

*Head noun comes before genitive noun
*Question particle comes before S (in those languages that have question particles)
*Article comes before noun (in those languages that have articles)

== Theoretical approaches ==

=== Functionalist approach ===

Many functional linguists do not posit an underlying syntactic tree in which a verb-initial language is SVO. Rather than try to find ways to derive the structures of verb-initial languages from underlyingly SVO structures, functional linguists would look at how cognitive principles make it possible for languages to have different word orders and why certain word orders are more common, less common, or almost non-existent. Russell Tomlin (in his 1986 paper "Basic word order. Functional principles") argued that there are three cognitively grounded principles which can account for the observed distributions of the frequencies of word order in human languages. The three principles are:

*Topic-first principle (more topical NPs come before less topical NPs)
*Animate-first principle (NPs with more animate referents come before NPs with less animate referents)
*Verb-object bonding principle (objects are more closely linked to the verb than subjects are)

Since subjects are generally more likely than objects to be topics and to have animate referents, the topic-first principle and the animate-first principle both cause a strong tendency in languages to prefer the subject to go before the object. Thus, languages where the object comes before the subject are rare.

Of the three possible word orders in which the subject comes before the object (VSO, SVO, and SOV), the VSO is less common because of the verb-object bonding principle, which states that objects tend to be more closely tied to verbs than subjects are (which is supported by phenomena such as object incorporation being found in many languages). Because of this principle, the two orders in which the object and verb are placed next to each other (SVO and SOV) are more common than VSO.

The way the three principles interact to produce stark differences in frequencies between the word orders is illustrated by the table below (the assumption is that the more of the three principles a particular word order satisfies the more frequent it would be):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Verb-object bonding principle !! Topic-first principle !! Animate-first principle
|-
| SOV || yes || yes || yes
|-
| SVO || yes || yes || yes
|-
| VSO || no || yes || yes
|-
| VOS || yes || no || no
|-
| OVS || yes || no || no
|-
| OSV || no || no || no
|}

According to the table above, the application of these three principles would predict the following hierarchy in the relative frequencies of word order:

SOV=SVO &gt; VSO &gt; VOS=OVS &gt; OSV

This prediction roughly corresponds to the real frequencies observed in the world's languages:

*SOV: 44.8%
*SVO: 41.8%
*VSO: 9.2%
*VOS: 3.0%
*OVS: 1.2%
*OSV: 0.0%

=== Generative approach ===
There are a number of different solutions proposed for deriving V1 word order in the generative framework. These solutions include the movement of the verb or verbal phrase from traditional SVO sentences, lowering the subject from a higher position, such as Spec-IP to adjoin to a projection of the verb, or stipulating that the specifier is right branching instead of the more common left branching specifiers found in X-bar theory.

==== Verb movement ====
A common analysis for V1 word order is the head-raising of the verb from a base-generated SVO sentence into a position higher than the subject. This is a popular proposal for Irish and other Celtic languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Verb first: On the Syntax of Verb Initial Languages.|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = |editor-last = Carnie|editor-first = Andrew|editor-last2 = Dooley|editor-first2 = Sheila Ann|editor-last3 = Harley|editor-first3 = Heidi}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also has been applied to Afroasiatic V1 languages such as Berber and Arabic (Ouhalla 1994). The V0 raising account has also been proposed for a number of Austronesian languages, but there is no existing proposal for Mayan languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To derive VSO word order, the verb raises through head movement and raises to either C or T.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Deriving VOS order through V head-raising is less straightforward. The common solution is scrambling, which has been proposed for deriving  Tongan (Otsuka 2002) and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] (Rackowski 2002) sentences. The scrambling mechanism involves the object moving to a high position, such as Spec,TP (Otsuka 2002), in order to check information structure features.

The head-movement analysis is motivated by ellipsis data in Celtic and Semitic languages, and by verb-adjacent particles and adverbs in Austronesian languages.

In Irish, [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|elliding]] all postverbal arguments is possible, suggesting that the subject and the verb belong to one functional projection, and the verb is outside of it (McCloskey 1991).

In Tagalog, there can be adverbs between the verb and the object in VOS order, implying that the verb and the object can be separated, and do not form a constituent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In Tongan, there is an asymmetry between case-marked arguments and clitic pronouns: the clitics surface pre-verbally, whereas the case-marked nouns can only surface post-verbally (Otsuka 2005). Otsuka (2005) proposed that the subject clitic undergoes head-movement to T0, and attaches to the verb, whereas the case-marked subject moves to Spec,TP. He concludes that only verb head-movement can explain such a syntactic asymmetry in Tongan.

==== Phrasal movement ====

V1 word order can also be analyzed as a derivation from the more common [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]] order through verbal phrase movement. This solution is commonly proposed for Austronesian languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Accounts on phrasal movement differ on 1) the highest maximal projection that moves (VP, vP, or TP), 2) the landing site of the moved phrase (Spec,TP or higher), and 3) the motivation for movement (generally agreed to be the EPP).

VOS order can be derived straightforwardly by raising the VP to a specifier position in a higher projection, such as the TP. 
[[File:VP movement to derive VOS.png|thumb|left|VP movement to derive VOS word order.]]

VSO order, on the other hand, has to be derived by remnant movement of the VP after evacuating the object from the phrase first.
[[File:VP movement to derive VSO.png|thumb|right|VP movement to derive VOS word order.]]

An argument for VP raising is the [[wh-movement|island constraints]] that arise in the VP in VOS sentences, due to [[The Freezing Principle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Formal Principles of Language Acquisition|last = Wexler|first = Kenneth|publisher = MIT Press|year = 1980|isbn = 0262730669|location = |pages = |last2 = Culicover|first2 = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; which says that there can be no movement out of a moved constituent.

Various [[Austronesian languages]] follow this constraint to various levels. [[Seediq language|Seediq]] for example is strict in that only VP-external constituents can go under A’-movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://faculty.washington.edu/aldr/pdf/AFLA8.pdf|title = Nominalization and WH-movement in Seediq and Tagalog|last = Aldridge|first = Edith|date = 2002|journal = Language and Linguistics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toba Batak language|Toba Batak]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Voice phrases and their specifiers|last = Sternefeld|first = Wolfgang|date = 1995|journal = Seminar für Sprachwissenschaft|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = VP raising in VOS language|last = Cole|first = Peter|date = 2008|journal = Syntax|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9612.2008.00106.x|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Hermon|first2 = Gabriella |volume=11 |pages=144–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; on the other hand, have this restriction only for VP-internal arguments, while allowing adverbs and indirect objects to surface clause-initially. One proposal to solve this problem is to propose that adjuncts evacuate from the VP, before it raises.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Mayan languages]], on the other hand, do not have such a restriction. [[Ch’ol language|Ch'ol]], for example, allows object extraction in WH-questions from VOS word orders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = VOS as predicate fronting in Chol Mayan|last = Coon|first = Jessica|date = 2010|journal = Lingua|doi = 10.1016/j.lingua.2008.07.006|pmid = |access-date =|volume=120|pages=354–378}}&lt;/ref&gt; For such cases, it has been proposed that the object evacuates before the phrasal movement to a higher position than the subject, and thus can undergo WH-movement later.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Right-hand specifier ====

[[File:Syntax-Verb Phrase with a Right Specifier.jpg|thumb|left|Verb phrase in X-bar structure with a right specifier.]]
[[File:Syntax - VSO word order with Right Specifiers and Movement.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Demonstration of a possible derivation of VSO word order in a rightward specifier theory.]]

Some researchers have proposed deriving verb-initial word order by modifying the basic [[X-bar theory|X-bar structure]] to permit right ward specifiers.  This analysis has been particularly influential for [[Mayan languages]], notably by [[Judith Aissen]] for [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Topic and Focus in Mayan|last = Aissen|first = Judith|date = 1992|journal = Language|doi = 10.2307/416369|pmid = |access-date =|volume=68|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is notable because it goes against standard X-bar theory and modern [[Minimalism (syntax)|Minimalist theories]] where all specifiers are required to be leftward.

[[File:Syntax-VOS word order with Right Specifiers and Movement.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Derivation of VOS word order with subject movement in a rightward specifier theory.]]

The difference between VSO and VOS word orders in a right-hand specifier theory is accomplished via a combination of controlling which specifiers are right-ward and controlling which argument(s) moves.  VOS word can be derived from the base positions of a VP with a right-specifier (note that the majority of this literature assumes the VP-Internal hypothesis).  From the base position, VOS can also be derived by moving the subject up to any right-specifier position (e.g. the specifier of IP).

VSO word order is derived from the same base order.  The object then moves to a right-specifier position above the VP (the specific landing site will vary from language to language).

Movement of either the subject or object arguments was originally motivated by positing an EPP feature on the landing site.  Modern analyses are more likely to argue that movement is motivated by a need to give the argument case or for purposes of [[information structure]].

==== Subject-lowering ====
Another type of approach to derive verb-initial word orders involves subject lowering, resulting in a structure in which the subject follows the verb. Whereas proposals for V-raising and VP-raising generally assume that the linear order of a sentence is derived in syntax, the subject lowering account assumes that phonological well-formedness determines the linear word order.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Subject lowering has been proposed by Sabbagh (2013).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Word order and prosodic structure constraints in Tagalog|last = Sabbagh|first = Joseph|date = 2013|journal = Syntax (to appear)|doi = 10.1111/synt.12012|pmid = |access-date =|volume=17|pages=40–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; He treats subject lowering as a [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] phenomenon.

[[File:01SubjectLoweringBasic.PNG|thumb|right|Basic syntactic structure featuring subject lowering.]]

The basic idea is as follows. After the syntactic derivation is done, the subject is in SpecIP/SpecTP. On its way to phonological realization, the end result of the syntactic derivation can be manipulated in order to satisfy phonological and morphological requirements. In the case of subject lowering, the subject will move to V and right-adjoin to it, as illustrated by the tree below (taken from Clemens &amp; Polinsky).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Different languages are said to feature subject lowering, namely [[Berber languages|Berber]] (Choe 1987), [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] (Chung 1990, 1998), [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] (Sabbagh 2005, 2013).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As Clemens &amp; Polinsky (2015) explain, support for subject lowering comes from [[Coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] facts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When two sentences are coordinated, the subject must be able to have scope over the coordination, even though it shows up in a lower position in the clause.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To be able to have this scope, the subject needs to occupy a high position in the syntactic derivation.

[[File:02SubjectLoweringTagalogBefore.PNG|thumb|left|Syntactic structure of transitive sentence in Tagalog]]
[[File:04SubjectLoweringTagalogAfter.PNG|thumb|right|Subject lowering in syntactic structure of transitive sentence in Tagalog.]]

[[File:03SubjectLoweringTagalogBeforeProsodic.PNG|thumb|left|Prosodic structure of transitive sentence in Tagalog.]]

[[File:05SubjectLoweringTagalogAfterProsodic.PNG|thumb|right|Subject lowering in prosodic structure of transitive sentence in Tagalog.]]

Sabbagh (2013) proposes a [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] constraint to motivate subject lowering in Tagalog.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This constraint is called Weak Start and it says that "[a] prosodic constituent begins with a leftmost daughter, which is no higher on the prosodic hierarchy than the constituent that immediately follows."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This proposal is situated in Match Theory (Selkirk 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The syntax-phonology interface|last = Selkirk|first = Elisabeth|date = 2011|journal = The handbook of phonological theory|doi = 10.1002/9781444343069.ch14|pmid = |access-date = |editor-last = Goldsmith|editor-first = John|editor2-last = Riggle|editor2-first = Jason|editor3-last = Yu|editor3-first = Alan|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell |pages=435–484}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Match Theory states that clauses (CP and IP/TP) with illocutionary force correspond to intonational phrases (ɩ), XPs correspond to phonological phrases (φ), and X⁰s correspond to phonological words (ω).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sabbagh (2013) proposes that the prosodic hierarchy is as follows:

Prosodic hierarchy: ɩ &gt; φ &gt; ω.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The prosodic constraint Weak Start regulates the order in which different members of the hierarchy can appear in a single prosodic phrase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The hierarchy states that elements that are relatively high on the prosodic hierarchy need to be preceded by elements that are equal or lower to them on the prosodic hierarchy (Sabbagh 2013).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In other words, phonological phrases (φ) need to be preceded by phonological words (ω).

This structure does not meet the requirement that Weak Start imposes on it (''i.e.'' elements high on the prosodic hierarchy need to be preceded by elements that are equal or lower on the hierarchy). The subject, which is a phonological phrase (φ), precedes the verb, a phonological word (ω). This means that there is a mismatch between syntax and phonology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In other words, for syntactic reasons, the subject must be high (because of scope over coordinations), but for phonology, the subject needs to follow the verb, instead of preceding it. Lowering the subject resolves this mismatch. The structure after subject lowering is illustrated in the structures below.

In these structures the verb (ω) precedes the hierarchically higher subject (φ). This structure obeys Weak Start. Thus, subject lowering is applied in order to satisfy this prosodic structure constraint.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Syntactic structures involving subject lowering obey syntactic and phonological principles. The subject has moved to SpecIP/SpecTP, which gives it its necessary scope (as can be inferred from coordination structures). Lowering the subject in the prosodic structure causes the structure to obey the phonological constraint Weak Start as well.

Serdatzky was born as Yente Raybman in [[Aleksotas]], near [[Kovno|Kovno (Kaunas)]], Lithuania (then in [[Kovno Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]]),&lt;ref name="Zucker69"&gt;Zucker, Sheva. "Yente Serdatzky: Lonely Lady of Yiddish Literature." ''Yiddish'' 8.2 (1992): 69-79; here: 69.&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of a used furniture dealer who was also a scholar.&lt;ref name="FoundTreasures"&gt;"Yente Serdatzky (1877-1962)" [author biography]. ''Found Treasures: Stories by Yiddish Women Writers''. Ed. Frieda Forman, Ethel Raicus, Sarah Siblerstein Swartz, and Margie Wolfe. Toronto, Ontario: Second Story Press, 1994. 365-366.&lt;/ref&gt;  She received a secular as well as a basic Jewish education, and learned German, Russian, and Hebrew. The family home was a gathering place for Yiddish writers around Kovno, including [[Avrom Reyzen]], and in this way she became acquainted with contemporary [[Yiddish literature]].&lt;ref name="Zucker69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FoundTreasures"/&gt;

Serdatzky married and had three children, and eventually ran her own grocery store.  In 1905, the year of the [[Revolution of 1905|Russian Revolution]], she took the radical step of leaving her family and moving to Warsaw, to pursue her writing. There she came into contact with the literary circle around [[I. L. Peretz]]. She had her literary debut with the story "Mirl," published in the Yiddish daily newspaper ''Der Veg'' (The Way), of which Peretz was the literary editor.  She received encouragement from Peretz, and published further work in that paper.&lt;ref name="Zucker69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FoundTreasures"/&gt;

In 1906, reunited with her family, Serdatzky emigrated to the United States.  After living initially in Chicago, she settled in New York City, where she ran a soup kitchen. She published short stories, sketches, and one-act plays in Yiddish periodicals including [[Freie Arbeiter Stimme|''Fraye arbeter shtime'']] (Free Voice of Labor), ''Fraye gezelshaft'' (Free Society), ''Tsukunft'' (Future), ''Dos naye Land'' (The New Land), and ''Fraynd'' (Friend). She also published stories regularly in the [[The Jewish Daily Forward|''Forverts'']] (The Forward), and became a contributing editor there.

In 1922, following a disagreement with ''Forverts'' editor [[Abraham Cahan]], Serdatzky was dismissed from the staff.  After that she dropped out of the literary scene, and supported herself in part by renting rooms.  Much later in her life, from 1949 to 1955, she published over 30 stories in Isaac Liebman's ''Nyu-yorker vokhnblat'' (New York weekly paper).&lt;ref name="FoundTreasures"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zucker70"&gt;Zucker (1992), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham Cahan described Serdatzky in 1914 as a successful writer of  "tales of real life."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hps3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA637&amp;dq=serdatsky&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=el-DU7mlMumksQSE9YGAAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=serdatsky&amp;f=false New Writers of the Ghetto]." ''The Bookman'' 39 (March–August 1914). 637.&lt;/ref&gt; The characters in her fiction are often women like herself, immigrants and intellectuals, inspired by left-wing political ideals, while facing disappointment in their everyday lives and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Bilik, Dorothy. "[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/serdatzky-yente Yente Serdatsky, 1877-1962]," undated. ''Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia'' [online version].  Jewish Women's Archive. Retrieved July 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Her stories at times convey a sense of "pervasive loneliness."&lt;ref name="Zucker70"/&gt;

Serdatzky's only book publication was ''Geklibene shriftn'' (Collected writings), published in New York by the Hebrew Publishing Company, in 1913.

[[File:Aljamiado.png|thumb|A passage from the Young Man's work. It is in Spanish written with Arabic script (''[[aljamiado]]'').]]
The '''Young Man of Arévalo''' ({{lang-es|el Mancebo de Arévalo}}) was a [[Morisco]] [[crypto-Muslim]] author from [[Arévalo]], [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] who was the most productive known Islamic author in Spain during the period after the [[forced conversion#Spain|forced conversion]] of Muslims there.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=170}} He traveled widely across Spain to visit crypto-Muslim communities and wrote several works about Islam which includes accounts from his travels.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=172}}{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=172}} His real identity and dates of birth and death are unknown, but most of his travels took place in the first half of the sixteenth century.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=172}}

== Biography ==
The Young Man was born in [[Arévalo]]{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=171}} to a mother who was converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=172}} His birth date is unknown, but his youth was estimated to be in the period following the end of [[Reconquista]], marked by the [[Fall of Granada]] in 1492 and the  forced conversion of Muslims in Castile, 1500{{ndash}}1502.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=172}} When he was young, he traveled to virtually all parts of Spain except the seabord provinces, which was forbidden to him due to his status as [[Morisco]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=172}} Places he visited include [[Alcántara]], [[Almagro, Ciudad Real|Almagro]], [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]], [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]], [[Gandia]], [[Granada]], [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], [[Ocaña, Spain|Ocaña]], [[Requena, Valencia|Requena]], [[Ronda]], [[Segovia]], and [[Zaragoza]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=172}}{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=180}} He collaborated with [[Bray de Reminjo]], the [[faqih]] of the village of [[Cadrete]] in [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]],{{sfn|Wiegers|1994|p=162}} to write an Islamic religious manual called ''Brief compendium of our sacred law and [[sunnah|sunna]]'', in the 1530s. {{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=172}} At this point he was presumed to have been a reputable writer.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=172}} Bray de Reminjo described him as "intellectual", a Castilian from Arévalo, and described that in addition to speaking Spanish and being well-versed in ''aljamiado'', he also read Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.{{sfn|Narváez Córdova|2006|p=491}} His works show his familiarity with the [[Quran]], the writings of [[Thomas à Kempis]], especially ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'', as well as the medieval novel ''[[La Celestina]]''.{{sfn|Narváez Córdova|2006|p=487}} His familiarity with Christian works was likely the result of his being obligated to attend missionary sermons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=176}}

Accounts of his travels included participating in a  secret congregational ritual prayer (''[[Salah#Prayer in congregation|salat jama'ah]]'') in [[Zaragoza]], meeting with Muslim notables and preachers, including some women, and collecting alms to go for [[hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=181}} It is unclear whether he was ultimately successful in visiting Mecca,{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=173}} given that travel out of the country was illegal for Moriscos. Throughout his writings he showed deep conviction that Islam was the right faith{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=173}} and that it would triumph again in Spain within his lifetime.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=182}}

== Works ==
[[File:De Imitatione Christi 001 title page 01.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' included passages that were likely adopted in the Young Man's ''Tafsira''.]]
He wrote at least three extant works, the ''Brief compendium of our sacred law and [[sunnah|sunna]]'' (c. 1533{{sfn|Thomas|Chesworth|2014|p=162}}), the ''[[Tafsir]]a'' (c. 1533{{sfn|Thomas|Chesworth|2014|p=165}}), and the ''Summary of the Account and Spiritual Exercise'' (c. shortly before 1550{{sfn|Thomas|Chesworth|2014|p=167}}), all written in Spanish with Arabic script (''[[aljamiado]]''), and primarily about religious topics.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=173}}&lt;ref name="Catlos2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian A. Catlos|title=Muslims of Medieval Latin Christendom, c.1050–1614|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RnU9AwAAQBAJ|date=20 March 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-91575-5|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the religious content, the works included accounts of his travels, his meetings with other clandestine Muslims, and descriptions of their religious practices and discussions.{{sfn|Wiegers|1994|p=162}} These accounts and reminiscences provide historians with information about the [[crypto-Muslim]] community in fifteenth-century Spain and their practices.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=179}}

The ''Brief Compendium'' is a work of [[fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence), covering topics of ''[[ibadah]]'' (Islamic acts of worship) and [[Islamic economics]].{{sfn|Wiegers|1994|p=161}} It was written in collaboration with Bray de Reminjo, marking a rare collaboration between Castilian (represented by the Young Man) and Aragonese (by Bray) Muslim traditions.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=121}} The ''Tafsira'' is a ''[[tafsir]]'' or a commentary of the Quran.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=174}} The ''Summary'' is a religious book on topics of devotion and piety.{{sfn|Wiegers|1994|p=173}}

Spanish scholar [[Pascual de Gayangos y Arce]] mentioned in 1839 of having seen an additional work he called ''The Pilgrimage of the Young Man'' in Madrid, but this work is now lost.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=193}}{{sfn|Narváez Córdova|2006|p=490}}

In 1980, Spanish author Gregorio Fonseca Antuña discovered close similarities between passages in the ''Summary'' and passages from [[Thomas à Kempis]]'s 15th-century work ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'', a Christian [[devotional book]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=174}} The passages were often adapted to replace specific Christian contexts and features with Islamic ones, while keeping the spiritual and moral meaning intact.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=176}} These similarities occur frequently throughout the book, including in long passages.{{sfn|Thomas|Chesworth|2014|p=167}}{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=174}} According to historian L. P. Harvey, Kempis' influence is "established beyond doubt",{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=174}} and could not have been due to chance.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=175}} The Young Man did not cite Kempis as sources for the passages, and frequently attributed the passages to Islamic scholars such as [[al-Ghazali]] and [[Ibn Arabi]], misleadingly.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=176}} The adaptation of Christian devotional literature in his Islamic work could be the result of his being obligated to attend missionary sermons, and a lack of access to actual Islamic literature.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=176}} In contrast to the ''Summary'', the Young Man's other works show considerable originality.{{sfn|Thomas|Chesworth|2014|p=168}}

== Possible identity ==
Historian [[L. P. Harvey]] proposed that the Young Man of Arévalo might have been the same person as Agustín de Ribera, a Morisco from Arévalo who claimed to be a prophet and had the epithet of ''el mozo'' (the lad), although he admitted that the theory had a lot of difficulties that he had not resolved.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=171}} Agustín was arrested by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1540 and records from his interrogation survived.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=111–112}}

== Legacy ==
The Young Man's works became known throughout the Morisco community, and he achieved fame as a scholar.{{sfn|Thomas|Chesworth|2014|p=160}} His works were copied up to the end of the sixteenth century, and cited by Morisco authors up to the beginning of the seventeenth century, just before the [[expulsion of the Moriscos]].{{sfn|Thomas|Chesworth|2014|p=160}}

He was the most productive known Islamic author in Spain during the period after the [[forced conversion#Spain|forced conversion]] of Muslims there,{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=170}} today historians often single him out for attention in studies of Morisco literature in this period. {{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=171}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4271">In [[linguistics]], a '''zero''' or '''null''' is a [[segment (linguistics)|segment]] which is not pronounced or written. It is a useful concept in analysis, indicating lack of an element where one might be expected.  It is usually written with the symbol "∅", in Unicode {{unichar|2205|Empty set|nlink=|html=}}. A common [[ad hoc]] solution is to use the [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] capital letter Ø instead.

There are several kinds of zero:

In [[phonetics]]:
*A ''null phoneme'' indicates that no [[phone (phonetics)|phone]] is produced where one might be expected. For example, in [[syllable]] structure analysis, [[null onset]] indicates that a syllable lacks an initial consonant (''onset'') that is normally required by [[phonotactics]] of the considered language. For an example, see [[Standard Chinese phonology#Zero onset]].

In [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]:
*A [[Null morpheme|zero morph]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAZeroMorph.htm What is a zero morph? @ SIL International]&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of no phonetic form, is an [[allomorph]] of a [[morpheme]] that is otherwise realized in speech.  In the phrase ''two sheep-∅'', the plural marker is a zero morph, which is an allomorph of ''-s'' as in ''two cow'''s'''''. In the phrase ''I like-∅ it'', the verb [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] has a zero affix, as opposed to the third-person singular present ''-s'' in ''he like'''s''' it''.
*Similarly, a '''zero inflection''' is an unrealized [[inflection]], such as in [[English plurals#Nouns with identical singular and plural|nouns with identical singular and plural forms]]. For example, plural of ''sheep'' can be analyzed as ''sheep-∅''.

In [[grammar]]:
*A zero [[pronoun]] occurs in some languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zas.gwz-berlin.de/research/projects/pb2/PB2_en_research.html ''Discourse-Cohesive Devices in Language Acquisition: Intersentential Anaphorical Relations'', Zentrum für Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft (ZAS)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the English sentence ''nobody knows ∅'' the zero pronoun plays the role of the object of the verb, and in ''∅ makes no difference'' it plays the role of the subject.  Likewise, the zero pronoun in ''the book ∅ I am reading'' plays the role of the relative pronoun ''that'' in ''the book that I am reading''. In [[generative grammar]], this is also referred to as [[PRO (linguistics)|PRO]]. In [[pro-drop|pronoun-dropping languages]], including [[null subject language]]s such as most [[Romance languages]], the zero pronoun is a prominent feature.
*A zero [[subordinate conjunction]] occurs in English in sentences like ''I know ∅ he likes me'', in which the zero conjunction plays the role of the subordinate conjunction ''that'' in ''I know that he likes me''. This comes naturally to native speakers of English, but some [[English as a second or foreign language|non-native learners of English]] have to consciously adjust to it, as their native languages rarely do it.
*A '''zero article''' is an unrealized [[indefinite article|indefinite]] or [[definite article]] in some languages.
*A [[zero copula]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msu.edu/~jk13/Abs.Sato.pdf ''A phonologically null copula functioning as a light verb in Japanese'' by Yutaka Sato, p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; in which a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] such as the verb ''to be'' is implied but absent. For example, in [[Russian language|Russian]] the copula is usually omitted in the [[present tense]], as in "Она красивая" (literally: ''She beautiful''), the same happening with colloquial [[Brazilian Portuguese]], as in "irônicos, aqueles" (literally: ''ironic, those'' [guys]), though never with the adjective coming after the subject as usual in Romance languages. In English the copula is sometimes omitted in some [[nonstandard dialect]]s.
