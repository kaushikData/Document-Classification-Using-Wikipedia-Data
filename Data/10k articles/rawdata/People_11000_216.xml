'''Addison Cairns Mizner''' (December 12, 1872 – February 5, 1933) was an American resort [[architect]] whose [[Mediterranean Revival Style architecture|Mediterranean Revival]] and [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]] style interpretations left an indelible stamp on [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]], where it continues to inspire architects and [[real-estate developer|land developers]].&lt;ref name=Bubil /&gt; In the 1920s Mizner was the best-known and most-discussed living American architect.&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|5}} [[Palm Beach, Florida]], which he "transformed", was his home, and most of his houses are there. He believed that architecture should also include interior and garden design, and set up Mizner Industries to have a reliable source of components. He was "an architect with a philosophy and a dream."&lt;ref name=Orr1977 &gt;{{citation
|title=Addison Mizner, Architect of Dreams and Realities
|first=Christina
|last=Orr
|year=1977
|publisher=Norton Gallery &amp; School of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} [[Boca Raton, Florida]], began as Mizner's project.

The {{convert|6|ft|2|in|m|adj=on}}, {{convert|250|lb|kg|adj=on}} ''bon vivant'' epitomized the "society architect." Rejecting other modern architects for "producing a characterless copybook effect," he sought to "make a building look traditional and as though it had fought its way from a small, unimportant structure to a great, rambling house that took centuries of different needs and ups and downs of wealth to accomplish. I sometimes start a house with a Romanesque corner, pretend that it has fallen into disrepair and been added to in the Gothic spirit, when suddenly the great wealth of the New World has poured in and the owner had added a very rich Renaissance addition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.critiquethis.us/2012/01/08/invasive-and-exotic-architectural-species-the-legacy-of-addison-mizner/|title=Invasive and Exotic Architectural Species: The Legacy of Addison Mizner|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=|website=critiquethis.us|publisher=|accessdate=11 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112042740/http://www.critiquethis.us/2012/01/08/invasive-and-exotic-architectural-species-the-legacy-of-addison-mizner/|archive-date=12 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or as he described his own never-built castle, drawings of which were part of his promotional literature, it would be "a Spanish fortress of the twelfth century captured from its owner by a stronger enemy who, after taking it, adds on one wing and another, and then loses it in turn to another who builds to suit his taste."&lt;ref name=Vickers /&gt;{{rp|21}} As these quotes suggest, many Mizner buildings contain styles from more than one period, but all foreign.

==Biography==
Born in [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], at the time "the educational center of [[California]]",&lt;ref name=Many /&gt;{{rp|8}} and (briefly) its first capitol, he traveled as a child with his father, [[Lansing B. Mizner]], a lawyer, former President of the [[California Senate]] and the [[United States|U. S.]] [[minister (diplomacy)|Minister]] to Central America, based in [[Guatemala]].
As a young man, he visited China in 1893,&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|54}} was briefly a gold miner in the [[Yukon]] (1898–99) (Canada, not Alaska).&lt;ref name="Federal Writers' Project 1939 229"&gt;{{citation

He kept as pets a series of monkeys, which often rode on his shoulder; his favorite had a headstone at his grave, identifying him as "Johnnie Brown, The Human Monkey, Died April 30, 1927." &lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|125}} He had a [[macaw]] parrot.&lt;ref name=Silvin &gt;{{cite book

|year=2014
|publisher=Star Group Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} He was "a character."
 
In 1932 Mizner published ''The Many Mizners'', an autobiography covering his youth, year mining, and time in New York until the death of his mother. A second volume telling of his life in Florida was begun but never completed; the Palm Beach Historical Society has the typed manuscript.&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|301}} Mizner died in 1933 of a [[heart attack]] in Palm Beach&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|254}} and is buried in the family vault at [[Cypress Lawn Memorial Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 32847). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Donald Curl, author of ''Mizner's Florida'',
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;He was just completely outgoing and basically a really good guy. One of the things he was noted for was the kindness toward the people who worked for him and the courtesy he showed them. Some of the other architects of this era were almost the reverse; they saw the other architects as their employees, and they should have nothing to do with the design other than putting it on paper. Mizner was not that way. When the bust began in Florida, he actually helped some of the young architects get established elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Bubil &gt;{{cite web

The vast majority of Mizner's employees developed a deep affection for and allegiance to him: "It was a pleasure working for Mizner", one remarked.&lt;ref name=Silvin /&gt;{{rp|79}}&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|203–204, 218}}

==Mizner's Hispanism==
Addison accompanied his father when the latter travelled to Guatemala in August 1889 to take up his duties there.&lt;ref name=Curl /&gt;{{rp|7}} His first stop, aged 15, on the boat to Guatemala was [[Mazatlán]], Mexico. This was Addison's first direct contact with the Hispanic world, which he described as "the greatest day of my life."&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; His father [[Lansing Mizner]] spoke fluent Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. pp. 13, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; as did his paternal step-grandfather, [[James Semple]], also a U.S. diplomat in Spanish America. Addison, who became fluent,&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; after some tutoring enrolled at the [[Instituto Nacional]] in Guatemala City,&lt;ref name="Orr"&gt;{{citation

|first=Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} "where we learned that boys fought with knives and not with fists."&lt;ref name=Many /&gt;{{rp|49}} He remained there for a year, visiting Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras with his father,&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. pp. 36-39&lt;/ref&gt; before returning to California in 1890 to study at the [[Bates School (San Rafael)|Bates School]], a boarding school in [[San Rafael, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. pp. 39, 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; His studies there ended in 1891 because of his brother [[Wilson Mizner|Wilson's]] expulsion for misbehavior.&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his studies briefly at [[Boone's College]] in [[Berkeley, California]], with the hope of passing the entrance examination for the University of California (today the [[University of California, Berkeley]]). Either he never presented himself for the examination,&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. pp. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt; or he failed it.&lt;ref name=Curl /&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref name=Many /&gt;{{rp|63}} In any event, that was the end of his formal education.

In his own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have based my design largely on the old architecture of Spain — with important modifications and to meet Florida conditions. I studied the architecture of Spain itself and drew somewhat on my knowledge of Spanish tropical America.&lt;ref name="Orr" /&gt;{{rp|22}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In one of his advertisements:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Spanish Art'''&lt;/big&gt; in Boca Raton homes adds a special charm to these dwellings, in a land of tropical beauty where the softness of the South makes life easy.&lt;ref name=Boomtime /&gt;{{rp|54}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also assembled an excellent library, which has survived, on Spanish and Spanish Colonial architecture.&lt;ref name="Orr" /&gt;{{rp|22}}

The first idea of Mizner about his first Florida building, today the [[Everglades Club]], was that it should contain "a [[Moorish]] tower",&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; a clear reference to the [[Alhambra]], which Mizner visited and commented on. The [[Mediterranean Revival]] style Mizner introduced to [[South Florida]] was not [[Turquerie|Turkish]], not Italian, it was Spanish, specifically the hottest, southern part of Spain, [[Andalucía]]; colonial Guatemala was similar. He taught workmen to make Spanish red roof tiles, appropriate for the climate.&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; A scholar states that Meisner's mature style was "founded upon the architecture of sixteenth and seventeenth-century Spain,"&lt;ref name=Ohr /&gt;{{rp|49}} although the [[Alhambra]] is older and Guatemala was primarily the workmanlike eighteenth- and nineteenth-century architecture of the south of Spain. Like a colonial Spanish architect would have, in many cases he worked without paper plans.

Many of Mizner's projects have Spanish names: El Mirasol, El Solano, La Ronda (discussed below), and others. In his never-realized plan for Boca Raton, between today's Palmetto Park Road and Hillsboro Boulevard, the main street, El Camino Real, has a Spanish name, though, in another of his fanciful stories, he claimed it was inspired by [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[Botafogo]] neighborhood (1925 brochure). (What Mizner's commissioned painting on the cover of his first catalog does resemble in Rio de Janeiro, is the [[:pt:Canal do Mangue]], which runs down the middle of a wide street, but is nowhere near Botafogo, which he may have mentioned because it is a more elegant name ("Mouth of Fire") than Mangue "[[mangrove]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Mizner the humorist==
In 1903 Mizner provided illustrations for ''The [[Limerick]] Up to Date Book'' of [[Ethel Watts Mumford]] (San Francisco: Paul Elder). It says something about Mizner that he would illustrate this poem:

{{poemquote|
There was a young person of Tottenhem, 
Whose manners, Good Lord! she'd forgotten them. 
When she went to the vicar's,
She took off her knickers
Because she said she was hot in them.}}

In 1902, with [[Oliver Herford]] and Ethel Watts Mumford, he published an annual illustrated ''The Complete Cynic. Being Bunches of Wisdom Culled from the Calendars of Oliver Herford, Ethel Watts Mumford, Addison Mizner''.

*The Cynic's Calendar of Revised Wisdom for 1903&lt;ref&gt;Mizner 1932. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times. January 10, 1903&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Cynic's Calendar of Revised Wisdom for 1904
*The Entirely New Cynic's Calendar of Revised Wisdom for 1905

One whose lack of veracity is documented is the tale of his visit with his father and other family members to the ruins of [[Copán]], in Nicaragua. "No one knew exactly where it was", and they needed "a small army of carriers and machete wielders to cut our way in". [[John Lloyd Stephens]] was "the only other white man to set foot on the temple steps in three hundred and seventy years".&lt;ref name=Many&gt;{{cite book

Mizner also omitted embarrassing information: he said his father retired as ambassador because "father's health broke down",&lt;ref name=Many /&gt;{{rp|62}} when in fact [[Lansing B. Mizner#Minister to Central America|his father was fired by Secretary of State]] [[James G. Blaine]] after a diplomatic incident.&lt;ref name=Curl /&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

It was on this trip that he received his first monkey, named [[Deuteronomy]], who drowned, on the return trip from Nicaragua to Guatemala, after she was hit on the head with a trombone ([[nota bene|n.b.]]) and fell overboard.&lt;ref name=Many /&gt;{{rp|52}}

As he told it in a totally fictitious tale, he laid out the town of [[Dawson Creek, British Columbia]], and with no tape measure.&lt;ref name=Ohr /&gt;{{rp|47}} He told a story about how, in 1892, [[Argelia Benton de Reina|Argelia Benton]] ([[:es:Argelia Benton]]), the American wife of Guatemalan dictator [[Jose Maria Reina Barrios]], invited him to build a new palace for her in [[Guatemala City]]. He was to receive a retainer of $25,000 in gold, but Barrios was assassinated before Mizner received any of the money. Mizner's dramatic story is not supported by the chronology: her residence/palace, Villa Argelia, already existed in 1892, and Barrios was assassinated in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later, Addison said several times&lt;ref&gt;Orr 1977. p. 13 n. 5&lt;/ref&gt; that he enrolled "at some point during this time" in the [[University of Salamanca]], in Spain, though the only known detail about his studies there, if they existed, is that he did not receive a degree.&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|48}} There is no confirmation that he ever studied there (and [[Salamanca]]'s isolation makes it an unlikely choice for a foreign student). The only cities in Spain that it is documented that he visited are [[Seville]], [[Granada]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], and [[Burgos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

So far as available evidence indicates, he never set foot in the small city of Salamanca. However, because of its prestigious and mellifluous name, Salamanca was mentioned by Mizner repeatedly.
* According to Mizner, the Spanish king, [[Alfonso XIII]], came to his hotel, insisted on seeing him,&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; and gave him paneling from "the private apartments of [fifteenth-century] [[Catholic Monarchs|King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain]] in Salamanca."&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; There were no such apartments in Salamanca.
* Mizner also said that the entry to the Cloister Inn was through "a large Romanesque arch reminiscent of the entrance gate of the University of Salamanca".&lt;ref name=Boomtime /&gt;{{rp|66}} There is no Romanesque architecture in Salamanca. 
* The Cloister Inn had a "Salamanca Room."&lt;ref name=Curl /&gt;{{rp|157}}
* The huge doors of the Cloister Inn were said to be "three-hundred-year-old originals from the University of Salamanca. In reality, these doors were made of Dade County pine in the workshops of Mizner Industries."&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|259}}
* The ceiling of the house La Bienvenida was "inspired by a cloister ceiling at the library at the University of Salamanca".&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|287}}

Mizner told this kind of story to his clients: in [[Playa Riente]], its "ceiling was from the Chapter House in Toledo, Spain, and the [[tracery]] of the doors and windows from the Casa Lonja at Valencia."&lt;ref name=Silvin /&gt;{{rp|40}} There was also a yellow carpet "reputed to have been woven by nuns for a cathedral in Granada."&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|195}} (There were no carpets at all, much less ones made by nuns, in Spain in the 16th and 17th centuries.) He never showed photographs or prints in books of the buildings he was allegedly imitating.

A similar Hispanic tale told several times by Mizner is that his [[Administration Buildings (Boca Raton, Florida)|administration buildings]] (in 2017 the [https://theaddisonofbocaraton.com/the-addison-overview/ Addison Restaurant]) was based on the house of the Spanish painter [[El Greco]], in [[Toledo, Spain]]. As Mizner surely knew, El Greco's house was long vanished, little is known of it, and the [[El Greco Museum, Toledo|house/museum of El Greco in Toledo]], recently constructed and opened in Mizner's day (1911), made no pretense to even be in the same location as the original house. Meisner did not follow the somber architectural style of Castile, where Toledo was, and a similarity between the two buildings is hard to see. Similarly, he made up the connection between the tower of the Cloister Inn, which is vaguely Spanish, with the [[Giralda]] tower of the Cathedral of Seville.&lt;ref name=Boomtime /&gt;{{rp|64}} The [[San Francisco Ferry Building]] (1892) — one of Polk's projects&lt;ref name=Curl /&gt;{{rp|10}} — does have a tower that clearly resembles the Seville tower. Two contemporaneous buildings in south Florida also contain towers based on the Giralda: the [[Freedom Tower (Miami)]] (1925) and the [[Miami Biltmore Hotel]] (1926), both products of the architectural firm [[Schultze and Weaver]], who in 1927 built the Boca Raton Club that Mizner could not.

(The feature of the Everglades Club that ''is'' linked to the Giralda is the Patio of Oranges: that is the garden of the Cathedral/former great mosque of Seville, where the Giralda is.)

Similarly, he said that he traveled with his father to [[San José, Costa Rica]] by river,&lt;ref name=Curl&gt;{{citation

He embellished it further by adding that they had missed a steamer and had to travel by [[dugout canoe]];&lt;ref name=Curl /&gt;{{rp|7}} there have never been dugout canoes in Costa Rica. He said that he based a dining hall, with multiple wash stations, on a "[[Hospital#Late medieval Europe|hospital]]" in [[Vic]], Spain; there is no such building in Vic. He also made up a prize fight in Australia;&lt;ref name="Federal Writers' Project 1939 229"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seebohm"/&gt;{{rp|65–83, 93, 125}} he had a lifelong leg injury&lt;ref name=Curl /&gt;{{rp|6}} and could not possibly box.

I was fast"&lt;ref name=Many /&gt;{{rp|203}}), and in a rematch knocked out and probably killed his opponent.&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|73}} He had to escape out the back door with his share of the gate, head for the harbor, and board a ship whose gangplank was conveniently just being drawn up.&lt;ref name=Many /&gt;{{rp|205–206}} One wonders what to make of his claim that he was "as good a bricklayer as any man I ever had. I can plaster as well as any plasterer I have seen. I am a fairly good carpenter, a better than ordinary electrician. I know how to wipe a joint in plumbing."&lt;ref name=Curl/&gt;{{rp|10}} Similarly, "I had to go into the nursery business and build a tree-moving machine. What fun it was teaching men how to stucco, teaching others how to cure pip in chickens, clearing jungles, killing land crabs, catching alligators. It was all like a game."&lt;ref name=Silvin /&gt;{{rp|14}}

==Mizner's buying trips==
He returned to Guatemala for a few months in 1904. His original plan, never implemented, was to buy coffee to sell in the U.S. (This turned later into a nonexistent coffee plantation that he bought.&lt;ref name=Ohr &gt;{{cite conference

He purchased an old monastery - the whole building. "The reason I wanted it was that eight of the side chapels of the church were intact and in each stood, thirty feet high, carved wood altars with heavy gilding." He also returned with a book of sketches of the architectural features of Antigua. This was a turning pount in his decision to become an architect.&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|95–97}}

Moving to New York in 1904, he filled his apartment with his Guatemala purchases: rich velvet and damask [[vestments]], ornate carved church paneling, [[reliquary|reliquaries]], gilded candlesticks, and other rare ornaments. He made "good money" selling them to visitors.&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|105}}

In 1905, Mizner visited Spain for the first time; after that, he visited Europe every year. After relocating to Florida, these trips occurred during the "off" season.&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|110}} In 1924, Mizner went on a buying trip to Spain, scouring antique shops, buying "furiously" thousands of items: wrought iron, tapestries, furniture, grillwork, and whole staircases.&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|183–184, 195}} He was accompanied by one of his clients, Eleanor Cosden, who is reported to have recalled "the guide in the church in Toledo who, Addison pointed out, got several things wrong," and that "he even straightened out our host, the [[Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]]!"&lt;ref name=Silvin/&gt;{{rp|64}} (The Duke of Alba, one of the richest men in Spain, visited Palm Beach in 1926.&lt;ref name=Silvin /&gt;{{rp|74}}) In 1926 he went on a similar trip, cut short by the financial crisis.&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|224–225}}

==Mizner's homosexuality==
Mizner has been described as "an early influential gay man in [[South Florida]]," "the gay father of South Florida architecture." He is portrayed as openly gay in the [[Stephen Sondheim]] — [[John Weidman]] musical ''[[Road Show (musical)|Road Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|last=Brunk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mizner described himself as a "lifelong bachelor," after "a few unsuccessful relationships with women in California and New York." One modern researcher says that "Wilson loved women sexually; Addison cherished their friendship and companionship."&lt;ref name=Silvin /&gt;{{rp|96–97}} He tells us, in ''The Many Mizners'', that he "fell desperately in love with Bertha Doffer", but the love did not last long, as she "had fallen out of a window at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]] and had been instantly killed".&lt;ref name=Many /&gt;{{rp|213–219, 229}} At the same time, when he was living in San Francisco, he had "an emotional relatonship with a young man, Jack Baird".&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|291}} He described a buying trip to Europe with Margaret "Peggy" Thayer, "a wicked little devil", as "the happiest two months of my life."&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|200}} (His story that he had had a "love affair with the president [of Guatemala]'s daughter"&lt;ref name=Many /&gt;{{rp|68}} is fictitious.)

Although at that period he could not be open, his biographer Caroline Seebohm said "his mature sexual taste was for very young men," "pretty boys with pretensions," and had "a series of young boys in tow" during his later years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Later, Addison was attracted to the young painter he used on the Cosden house, Achille Angeli, 'a strikingly handsome young fellow'."&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|291}}

==Early architectural career==

Little is known about Addison Mizner's sketches and artwork prior to his architectural career; he did brag in 1893 of having sold six pictures for $150.&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|54}} His subsequent work shows him to be a fine [[technical drawing|draftsman]] and an [[artist]] who painted beautiful [[watercolor]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Although he lacked formal university training, Mizner served a 3-year [[apprenticeship]] (1894-1897) in the office of [[San Francisco]] architect [[Willis Polk|Willis Jefferson Polk]], eventually becoming a partner.&lt;ref&gt;Mizner 1932. p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|59}} Polk was only five years older than Addison and was not committed to any architectural style.&lt;ref name=Curl /&gt;{{rp|10}} "His [Mizner's] architectural training rivaled that of many in the profession of his day."&lt;ref name=Curl /&gt;{{rp|3}}

In 1904 he relocated to [[New York City]], and then to nearby [[Port Washington, New York|Port Washington]], [[Long Island]].&lt;ref name=Curl /&gt;{{rp|16–21}} During his first five years in New York, Mizner never built a house. The commissions he did receive were for interior design, which in two cases were the interior of [[yacht]]s,&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|134–135}} and in designing [[garden]]s.&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|135–136}} Eventually he designed numerous country houses across [[Long Island]] and the region. In 1907, he and [[William Massarene]] designed [[White Pine Camp]], a retreat in the [[Adirondack Mountains]], later used by U. S. President [[Calvin Coolidge]] as his "Summer White House".

==Florida==

In January 1918, aged 46, Mizner visited [[Palm Beach, Florida]] for his health, at the suggestion of [[Paris Singer]], whose house guest he was.&lt;ref name=Curl /&gt;{{rp|38}} He was "prepared to die", but instead recovered.&lt;ref name=Bubil /&gt; He decided to stay. The existing architecture in Palm Beach was wooden — Flagler's two hotels, the [[Royal Poinciana Hotel|Royal Poinciana]] and [[The Breakers (hotel)|The Breakers]] (burned 1925), were wooden&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|155}} — and in a style better suited for colder weather, Mizner tells us.{{where|date=December 2017}} Familiar from Guatemala with Hispanic warm climate architecture, he chose it as a style more appropriate for [[South Florida]]. His [[Mediterranean Revival]] designs won the attention and patronage of wealthy clients, who preferred to build their own individual ocean-front mansions. Constructed of stone, tile, and stucco, his buildings were better suited to Florida's semi-tropical climate (and threat of hurricanes) than the wooden shingle-style resort architecture imported from the Northeast. As a result of Mizner, "Palm Beach was transformed.".&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|48}} Mizner "designed with the wealthy in mind"; people "began building private residences on a grand scale."&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|46}} As a result in large part of Mizner, "by 1925 Palm Beach had established itself as ''the'' resort community of the United States."&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|48}}

Mizner's concept of architect was that he did not just design a building, but also its interior decoration and gardens.&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|37}}

His houses were generally one room deep to allow [[natural ventilation|cross-ventilation]], with kitchens located in wings to keep their heat away from living areas. Kitchens were also located [[downwind]] of the dining area. They were built with courtyards on various levels, replete with arcades and lofty galleries; rooms featured exposed rafters and vaulted ceilings; tiled pools and [[mosaics]] were said to resemble those of [[Pompeii]]&lt;ref name="fwp"/&gt; (if that is not another of Mizner's exaggerations). Other characteristic features included [[loggia]]s, [[colonnade]]s, clusters of columns supporting [[arch]]es, [[French door]]s, [[casement window]]s, [[tile|barrel tile]] roofs, [[hearth]]s, grand [[stairway]]s and decorative [[ironwork]].

===The Everglades Club===
Mizner's first big commission, and the project that made him famous, was the [[Everglades Club]], which opened in January, 1919. It was a "revelation" and its architectural impact "cannot be exaggerated."&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|163}} Another scholar says that Mizner "revolutionized Palm Beach architecture".&lt;ref name=Curl /&gt;{{rp|1}}
No one had seen anything like it: a "gorgeous pink stucco palace, with arcades, wrought-iron balconies, and terra-cotta-tile roofs."&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|163}} There were two four-hundred-year-old doors, and chairs of the same antiquity.&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|164}} Hispanic tiles were everywhere. "It took the place by storm", said Singer years later.&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|165}} An even larger project, the 147-room mansion [[El Mirasol (mansion)|El Mirasol]] (demolished), followed in 1919.&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|166–168}} Mizner received many subsequent commissions, in what was the most successful part of his career. From 1919 to 1924 he designed about thirty-eight houses in Palm Beach. His clients were wealthy and socially prominent: [[Gurnee Munn]], [[John Shaffer Phipps]], [[Barclay Harding Warburton II]], [[Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr.]], [[Edward Shearson]], [[Rodman Wanamaker]], [[Paul Moore Sr.]], and [[Edward T. Stotesbury|Eva Stotesbury]] among them.&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|170}} For them, he created "a Mediterranean village".&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|171}}

===Mizner Industries===
To make materials for the Everglades Club, he and [[Paris Singer]] purchased a small facility and began the manufacture of roof and floor tiles, with a sideline production of ironwork and furniture. The factory also made pottery; Mizner viewed pottery as something that "could be effectively used to integrate an indoor and outdoor color scheme."&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|53}} The factory was called "Las Manos" ("The Hands"), referring to the way products were made there: "con las manos", with our hands, by hand.

After the Club was completed in 1919, Singer sold Mizner his interest in the factory,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

|publisher=Boca Raton Historical Society &amp; Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mizner lacked the talent for making conventional plans and specifications. Everything was done off-the-cuff. Plans for one house were drawn in the sand on the beach. He was a pioneer in developing artificial or cast stone, a combination of [[coquina]] shell, [[lime (material)|lime]], and a cement mixture. He also used "woodite", a composite material with a wood component, which could be poured and molded.&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|59}} As a result, Mizner Industries sold "precast plastering", highly ornate plaster coffered ceilings and mouldings,&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|54}} and with woodite, besides antique-style doors, the paneling of a complete room, all at a relatively low cost.&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|58}} "One of the major difficulties in identifying Mizner buildings is the presence of Mizner Industries stonework on non-Mizner buildings";&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|54}} a number of buildings he did not build are frequently misattributed to him.&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|50 n. 19}}

Mizner Industries, copying imported antiques or photographs, manufactured beds, tables, [[taboret]]s, chests, dressing tables, wardrobes, "all pieces of furniture imaginable." There were two qualities: "a superior, handcrafted line ... extremely difficult to distinguish from authentic Spanish antiques," and another "good, sturdy line with little or no hand attention."&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|58}}

===Mizner's Florida style===
Mizner was anything but a follower of styles. He would ''[[ad lib]]'' a building's design as he went; he was someone who "would take a lot of liberties",&lt;ref name=Bubil /&gt; who "let his imagination run riot".&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|137}} In the end, Mizner would create a pink-walled, red-tiled, wrought iron-gated world of unreal luxury. Developers loved the Mizner style because it gave their brand-new developments an air of established, Old World elegance. It was imitated in new developments up and down the Florida peninsula. "It is style," said Donald Curl. "As an architect, he introduced Mediterranean revival, or Spanish revival, or whatever you wanted to call it. He made it not only popular but fashionable. Mizner was someone who was willing to take a lot of liberties and design buildings that were good for the climate and the lifestyle of the people who were his clients."&lt;ref name=Bubil /&gt; "I never begin to design a home without first imagining some sort of romance about it. Once I have my story, then the plans take place easily."&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|175}}

Mizner created a version of Spanish style that was appropriate to twentieth-century Florida.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The loggia room has survived as the [[Florida room]]. The changing room is now an essential. The focal point, now swimming pool with bridge or hanging basket chair, creates the necessary element of excitement. Native building materials are touted. Red tile remains a precious commodity. Pastel colors prevail. Meandering streets with boutiques are today's key to a successful commercial adventure. The advantages of mixed residential and commercial use have become obvious.&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|48}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==="Antiquing" buildings===
To get the all-important appearance of antiquity Mizner inflicted vandalism. He deliberately smudged up new rooms with burning pots of tarpaper, took penknife to woodwork and statuary, chipped tiles, used acid to rust the iron, made wormholes with an icepick,&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|54, 56–58}} cracked   a [[fireplace mantle|mantle]] with a [[sledgehammer]], all creating what he called "the kiss of the centuries."&lt;ref name=Silvin /&gt;{{rp|37}} He hired inexperienced help to lay roof tiles awry, and once had men in hobnailed boots walk up and down a stairway before the cement set to get the effect of centuries of wear. One of his original contributions to architecture was the discovery that worm-eaten [[cypress]] gave the desired effect of age; thus "[[mycelium|pecky]]" [[Taxodium distichum|cypress]], weak and worthless for structural elements, suddenly became the [[mahogany]] paneling of Palm Beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

*Mizner's first major Florida commission was the [[Everglades Club]], a Spanish-mission-style convalescent retreat built in 1918, that became (and remains) a private club. It stands at 4 Via Parigi (off Worth Avenue) in Palm Beach.
*Mizner designed the 37-room [[El Mirasol (mansion)|El Mirasol]] ("the sunflower"), completed in 1919, for [[investment banker]] [[Edward T. Stotesbury]],&lt;ref&gt;Curl 1984. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; head of the town's most notable family of the time. It included a 40-car [[garage (house)|garage]], a [[tea house]], an [[auditorium]] and a private [[zoo]]. The mansion stood at 348 N. Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach, but was demolished in the 1950s.
*La Bellucia, at 1200 South Ocean Boulevard, was built in 1920 for Dr. Willey Lyon Kingsley.&lt;ref&gt;Curl 1984, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 it was Palm Beach's largest recorded sale at $24 million.&lt;ref&gt;Miami Herald; December 8, 2009. p. 3C&lt;/ref&gt;
*Also in 1920, Mizner built a grand Palm Beach estate home called Costa Bella ("beautiful coast") at 111 Dunbar Road for Elizabeth Hope Gammell Slater. Her father was Prof. William Gammell, and her grandfather was Robert Ives of the firm Brown and Ives. In a story published in ''The New York Times'' in 1882, her mother was "reckoned the richest woman in America, her property placed at twenty millions or more." Addison Mizner used his primary builder and contractor at that time, Cooper C. Lightbown, who later became the Town of Palm Beach's Mayor from 1922-1927.
:In his book ''Mizner's Florida'', author and historian Donald W. Curl noted the home's "massive stone staircase" and that the home was more formal than Mizner's typical work. This formality is seen in such details as the pure Belgian black marble he used in the entrance foyer, and one of the first uses of terrazzo flooring for the 1920s showcased in the palatial dining hall. Furthermore, Curl notes the "stalactite" lighting fixture and gothic tracery for the dining room ceiling. It is believed that Mizner replicated the plasterwork in the dining room from photographs of the Alhambra that he had taken from his travels in Spain. Costa Bella's massive ballroom and dining hall feature grandiose palladian windows and french doors. Hence, historian Curl comments that, "the extensive fenestration created an open and light vacation house." Costa Bella is the quintessential example of Mizner's architectural majesty encompassing all the elements and building materials he is famous for: towering hand-stenciled wood beamed cypress ceilings, coral stone flooring, antique tiles, elaborate decorative columns and corbels, unique light fixtures, stone carvings and stone-carved fireplace mantels.
*In 1922, Mizner built the [[William Gray Warden House|William Gray Warden Residence (Warden House)]] at 112 Seminole Ave, Palm Beach, which is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flheritage.com/facts/reports/places/index.cfm?fuseaction=ListAreas&amp;county=palm%20beach Palm Beach County listings at Florida's Office of Cultural and Historical Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310140242/http://www.flheritage.com/facts/reports/places/index.cfm?fuseaction=ListAreas&amp;county=palm%20beach |date=2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another fanciful Palm Beach mansion, Villa Flora, was built in 1923 for [[Edward Shearson]]. It stands at 110 Dunbar Road.&lt;ref&gt;Curl 1984. p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;
*La Guerida ("bounty of war") was built in Palm Beach in 1923 for [[Rodman Wanamaker]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], heir to the [[Wanamaker's]] [[department store]] fortune. It was later purchased by [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.|Joseph Kennedy]] in 1933 during the depths of the [[Great Depression]] for a paltry $120,000, and eventually would become President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s "Winter White House". It stands at 1095 N. Ocean Boulevard.
*As early as 1925, Mizner was commissioned by Dr and Mrs (Lillian) Thomas Dempsey to build a beautiful, diminutive Mediterranean Revival summer home (possibly the smallest structure Mizner ever built). The house has 22' ceilings, enabling the architect to install a "mezzanine-loggia," circumlocuted by the hand-wrought iron railings for which a classic Mizner building is known. The house, at 100 S. Osborne Avenue, [[Margate, New Jersey]] (formerly 8704 Atlantic Ave) is on a beach block corner where Atlantic Ave intersects Osborne. (A stone's throw away, another architectural landmark, known as [[Lucy the Elephant]], holds court at the corner of Atlantic and Washington Avenues.)  Jeff Rosen of Spielberg Productions, who purchased the home from the Dempsey estate, later sold it to Marsha &amp; Michael Birnbaum of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. It has since been purchased and is occupied by auteur-singer-poet Silkë Berlinn.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
*Mizner's own Palm Beach home was built in 1925. It was called El Solano after the hot, oppressive wind which blows off the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in eastern [[Spain]], but also for [[Solano County, California]], his birthplace. Sold to [[Harold Vanderbilt]], the estate was later purchased by [[John Lennon]]. It stands at 720 S. Ocean Boulevard.
*He designed and built the [[Riverside Baptist Church]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], completed in 1926. Because he promised to build it in honor of his mother, Ella Watson Mizner, the architect refused payment for his services. The church stands at 2650 Park Street, and is Mizner's only work of [[religious architecture]].
*The clubhouse for the Wee Burn Country Club in Darien, Connecticut was designed by Mizner in his Mediterranean style in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Diedrich 2008. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A mansion of {{convert|14,550|sqft|sqm}}, with a {{convert|4800|sqft|sqm}} guest house, was built at 1820 S. Ocean Blvd. for [[Paul Moore, Sr.]] (completed 1926). After a two-year renovation-and-restoration project, the property was listed for sale in 2018 for $58,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Mizner Mile==
In [[Boynton Beach, Florida]], between Palm Beach and the future Boca Raton, Mizner's first vision of a "comprehensive ocean city"&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman/&gt;{{rp|244}} was a mile-long resort. "Mizner Mile, situated on [what is today (2018)] Old Ocean Boulevard, was to include a club, [[polo]] fields, houses designed by Mizner, and a two-thousand-room hotel modeled on 'the lines of a Spanish monastery'."&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman/&gt;{{rp|244}} He planned to exchange the design of a new Boynton City Hall for city commissioners' permission to build his hotel and club. The project (1924–1925) went aground, and Mizner abandoned it, after locals strongly opposed the relocation of Old Ocean Boulevard — a new road was built and the original road was to be destroyed — to allow beachfront lots. He designed plans for a never-built Boynton Woman's Club without fee "in an effort to make amends to the city".&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman/&gt;{{rp|244–245}}

==Boca Raton development==

In 2018 [https://theaddisonofbocaraton.com/the-addison-overview/ ''The Addison''], a venue for wedding receptions and similar celebrations.]]

In 1925 Addison Mizner embarked on his most ambitious project, what he called his "culminating achievement":&lt;ref name="Boomtime"&gt;{{cite book
|isbn=9780738544434
|publisher=Arcadia
|date=2007
|title=Boomtime Boca. Boca Raton in the 1920s
|first1=Susan, and Boca Raton Historical Society
|last1=Gillis}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}} the creation of a fabulous resort at [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]]. He claimed that it would offer more than Palm Beach, and was "undoubtedly the most tremendous land development project ever launched in the state of Florida."&lt;ref name=Vickers /&gt;{{rp|21}} The city was incorporated in 1924 and immediately appointed him city planner. Boca Raton's original [[Boca Raton Old City Hall|City Hall]], which currently houses the city's Welcome Center and the [[Boca Raton History Museum]], began as his project, though because of the bankruptcy of Mizner Industries he did not complete it, and it is more modest than he planned.

He began by forming the Mizner Development Corporation, a syndicate of prominent investors including [[Rodman Wanamaker]], [[Singer Island|Paris Singer]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[William Kissam Vanderbilt II]], [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Jesse Livermore]], [[Clarence H. Geist]], and [[T. Coleman du Pont]] as chairman. In March the corporation quietly bought up {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} of ocean-front property with an overall total of over {{convert|1600|acre}}. On April 15, 1925, the syndicate announced this large development, labeled the "Venice of the Atlantic", which would feature a thousand-room hotel, two golf courses, a polo field, parks, and miles of paved and landscaped streets which included a {{convert|160|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} grand boulevard called El Camino Real.&lt;ref&gt;Curl 1990. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In an address before 100 salespeople, the architect declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is my plan to create a city that is direct and simple ... To leave out all that is ugly, to eliminate the unnecessary, and to give Florida and the nation a resort city as perfect as study and ideals can make it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the first day of selling lots, May 14, 1925, $2 million was sold with a further $2 million within the first month. There was a traffic jam in front of his Miami office. Mizner ran buses to Boca from [[Worth Avenue]] in Palm Beach, and also used [[seaplane]]s to transport potential buyers to the site.&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|252, 254}} According to a typically exaggerated sales brochure, he had offices in "several cities in Florida", as well as New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and [[Savannah, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|250}} (The only sales offices were in Palm Beach, Miami, and his Administration Buildings in the future Boca Raton.)

By the end of October over $25 million in lots had been sold (though in most cases not paid for). Seeing that the large hotel would take a long time to build, Mizner immediately began work on a 100-room smaller hotel, the [[Ritz-Carlton]] Cloister Inn (now a wing of the [[Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club]]).&lt;ref&gt;Curl 1990. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed in late 1925 and opened in early 1926,&lt;ref name=Boomtime /&gt;{{rp|63}} at a cost of $1,750,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Mizner's role in the land boom collapse of 1926==
Where Mizner was not strong was in planning. He built houses "off the cuff", without plans. He also had no financial plan, and tried to handle finance off the cuff as well. But the facilities he had announced — three golf courses, a polo ground,&lt;ref name=Boomtime /&gt;{{rp|53}} a theater, a large church, and an airport,&lt;ref name=Boomtime /&gt;{{rp|99}} to start with — were going to require a lot of money to build. Mizner did not have it, and he did not have a plan for getting it, or as a writer put it, his "extravagant imagination outstripped his budget and the market."&lt;ref name=Vickers &gt;{{cite news

|isbn=0817307230}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lacked "financial sense and business shrewdness."&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|265}} What he had were a lot of high society contacts, fame, and a track record building houses for the wealthy in Palm Beach.

When he set up Mizner Development Corporation in 1925, he was able to assemble a fantastic board of famous people and investors. This was a prime reason why initial sales were spectacular. [[Marie Dressler]], recruited as a salesperson, described selling Boca Raton lots as "a creative endeavor" and the activity there as theater ("uprooting large palm trees and planting them around houses ... to lend a touch of tropic romance to a scene").&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|253}}

A 1925 advertisement reassures purchasers ("doubters") that Florida property is "gold", and that they are getting a bargain, buying early.&lt;ref name=Boomtime /&gt;{{rp|46}} Another, that "an investment in Boca Raton soil [sic] is an anticipation of potential profit," and "every promise of the Mizner Development Corporation is meant to be kept."&lt;ref name=Boomtime /&gt;{{rp|43}} His advertisements said to attach the ad to the sales contract, as a part of it,&lt;ref name=Curl /&gt;{{rp|147}} and noted "the names" who were "guaranteeing" the project.&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|258}} Using the names to make sales was the idea of publicity agent [[Harry Reichenbach]]. But the [[cash flow]] was not even close to sufficient to build his promised facilities.&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|265}}  Some of the directors, whose attorneys warned them of potential liability, since their names were being used in advertisements, resigned. DuPont unsuccessfully requested the resignations of Reichenbach and corporation treasurer Wilson Mizner, who taught salesmen to mention the famous names.&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|252}} He resigned as chairman of the board on October 24, 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By May 1926 unpaid contractors were beginning legal action against the company, forcing it into [[receivership]].&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|225}} This led to Mizner's losing control of the corporation in July 1926 and to bankruptcy in September. This was the beginning of the end of Mizner's career as an architect.

A statement during the bankruptcy proceedins outlined what the Mizner Development Corporation had accomplished as of December 4, 1926, besides building the Administration Buildings and the Cloister Inn:

{{quote|{{convert|3000|acre|spell=In}} were cleared; land was cleared for {{convert|42|mi|spell=in}} of streets and {{convert|32|mi|spell=in}} were graded; {{convert|180000|sqft|spell=in}} of sidewalks built; seven bridges had been constructed; {{convert|13|mi|spell=in}} of water mains installed; and fifteen wells for water supply drilled and connected. Forty-six houses had been completed and thirty-five more were under construction. Two golf courses, the Cloister course and the Ritz-Carlton course, were fully completed with functioning water systems and an equipped radio broadcasting station had been finished.&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|267}}}}

==Bankruptcy ==
The bankruptcy was resolved a year later in November 1927, when [[Clarence Geist]] bought the Company's assets. As well as the Cloister Inn, the corporation had built two [[Administration Buildings (Boca Raton, Florida)|Administration Buildings]], a radio station, [[WFLA (Boca Raton, Florida)|WFLA]], and twenty-nine homes.&lt;ref&gt;Curl 1990. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Geist, a [[utilities]] executive, saw to it that Boca got a fine water plant; Mizner was unconcerned about such [[infrastructure]].

Many people lost money through their investments in Boca Raton lots through Mizner; people who had purchased lots with the intention of quickly reselling them, very common during the land boom,&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|255}} found them worthless. After bankruptcy proceedings, creditors received 0.1%, on the dollar; for example, the Andrews Asphalt and Paving Company received $93.36 of its $93,362 claim, and Riddle Engineering Company received $30.76 of its bill of $30,764.&lt;ref name=Vickers /&gt;{{rp|173}} The [[Palm Beach Savings Bank]], which had lent Mizner Development over 70% of its capital (the stockholders of Mizner were also officers of the bank), closed permanently in June, 1926, because of the Mizner bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=Vickers /&gt;{{rp|67}} After the bankuptcy, when credit typically improves, Mizner borrowed:
* $99,636 from the [[Farmers Bank and Trust Company]]
* $47,500 from the [[Commercial Bank and Trust Company]]
* $101,689 from the [[First American Bank and Trust]]
* $57,982 from the [[Palm Beach Bank and Trust Company]]
* $99,500 from the [[Chelsea Exchange Bank]]
Nothing was ever repaid of the last three loans.&lt;ref name=Vickers /&gt;{{rp|66}} Mizner himself was hurt financially. He was not noted for his business acumen, and a recent biographer qualifies him as "naïve" and "in denial", but with no intention to defraud. No one has ever described Mizner as greedy or motivated by prospects of financial gain. Members of his board, it was learned after banking records were unsealed over sixty years later, were engaged in criminal embezzlement through their partnership in the Palm Beach Savings Bank. Mizner knew nothing of this and would have been horrified if he had learned of it.&lt;ref name=Seebohm /&gt;{{rp|226–227}}

Mizner Industries was declared bankrupt four months after Mizner's death in 1933. Among other things, the company stopped paying federal tax and county property tax after 1928. The company emerged from the bankruptcy reorganization and continued operations.&lt;ref name=Vickers /&gt;{{rp|174–175}}

==Late career==
In 1927 Mizner built a house for John R. Bradley called Casa Serena in Colorado Springs. Several of Mizner's friends got together in 1928 to publish a folio monograph of his work. It was entitled ''Florida Architecture of Addison Mizner'' and featured 185 photographs of homes by Frank Geisler. Paris Singer contributed an introduction and [[Ida M. Tarbell]] wrote the text.&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an "Edición Imperial", limited to 100 copies, a leather-bound, gold-[[tool]]ed version with slipcase cover.&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|278}} This brought Mizner several commissions but they came to a stop with the beginning of the world depression. "With neither prospects nor money, [he] was sadly forced to rely on financial support from friends [such as] [[Irving Berlin]] and Edward Moore."&lt;ref name=PerkinsCaughman /&gt;{{rp|292–293}}
 
The one exception was the extensive Dieterich estate, 'Casa Bienvenida' (Welcome House), on Park Lane in [[Montecito, California|Montecito]] near [[Santa Barbara, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; He designed and directed its creation from 1929 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slides-www.ucsc.edu/styles/dbms.acgi$BrRecs?10.589 USC archives]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802065453/http://slides-www.ucsc.edu/styles/dbms.acgi%24BrRecs?10.589 |date=August 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The significant new [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean Revival]] estate's budget was unhindered by the [[Wall Street crash of 1929]]. The naturalistic landscape and formal gardens were designed by atmospheric painter and landscape designer [[Lockwood de Forest|Lockwood de Forest Jr.]] (1850–1932). His water channels are replicas of those at [[Villa Lante]] at Bagnaia, near [[Viterbo]] in the Italian [[Tuscany]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Vogt 1993. p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Mizner integrated the principal indoor and outdoor rooms by a cloistered arcade with slender columns on three sides of a large courtyard. He linked that to the inclined axis with a pavilion in the form of a Palladian arch on a terraced stone pedestal at the vista terminus.&lt;ref name="Andree 1980. p.156"&gt;Andree 1980. p.156&lt;/ref&gt; Casa Bienvenida is extant and well maintained to the present day.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Spanish revival style here draws its forms and elements from medieval sources. Mizner used many high art details not generally found in this area ... while maintaining the Santa Barbara characteristic of pure design.&lt;ref name="Andree 1980. p.156"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Laronda2.jpg|thumb|[[La Ronda (Estate)|La Ronda]] (Percival E. Foerderer mansion), Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania (1929, demolished Oct. 2009).]]
Mizner's buildings were typically dismissed by [[Modernist]] critics for their eclectic historicist aesthetic. Many were torn down and redeveloped, but a number of those that survive are now on the [[National Register of Historic Places|National Register]].

Architects and contractors alike copied Mizner's iteration of Spanish colonial architecture.&lt;ref name=Orr1977 /&gt;{{rp|48}}

The Mizner name lives on. In the Boca Raton area, his names, Addison and Mizner, are frequently found on streets, businesses, and developments. On the grounds of the Boca Raton Resort and Club is Mizner Lake Estates, an intimate 15-estate gated enclave of million dollar homes with 24-hour security. In Delray Beach can be found Addison Reserve Country Club, a golf and tennis community of 717 luxury single-family homes situated on {{convert|653|acre|km2}}. It consists of nineteen villages with names such as "Mirasol" and "Playa Riente".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Boca Raton is [[Mizner Park]], an upscale "[[lifestyle center]]" with shops, rental apartments, and offices. In March 2005, to commemorate his visionary contributions to both the city and Florida architecture, an {{convert|11|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} statue of the architect by [[Colombian people|Colombian]] [[sculptor]] Cristobal Gaviria was erected in Boca Raton at Mizner Boulevard and [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|U.S. 1]]. In addition, Addison Mizner Elementary School in Boca Raton was named for him in 1968.

He was the brother and sometimes partner of businessman, raconteur, con man, professional gambler, and playwright [[Wilson Mizner]], whom Addison called "my chief weakness and dreaded menace".&lt;ref name=Many /&gt;{{rp|235}} The brothers' series of picaresque misadventures were the inspiration for [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s musical ''[[Bounce (musical)|Road Show]]'' (2008) (also titled ''Bounce'' and ''Gold!''), which was also produced in Chicago and London. Previously, in 1952, Addison's friend [[Irving Berlin]] wrote a musical called ''[[Wise Guy (musical)|Wise Guy]]'' (also called ''Palm Beach, Sentimental Guy'', and ''The Mizner Story''), which never got produced. It featured Addison, Wilson, his friends, and his clients.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin 2005. p. 455&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Introduction by Isaiah Sheffer, three songs from that work were included in the sheet music album ''The Unsung Irving Berlin,'' 1996. The only one found there, "You're a Sentimental Guy

In 1951 [[Theodore Pratt]] wrote a novel, ''The Big Bubble'', which is a thinly veiled biography of Mizner.&lt;ref&gt;
Lynfield 1984&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 [[Richard René Silvin]] published his book ''Villa Mizner: The House that Changed Palm Beach'', chronicling the life of Addison Mizner though a story about Mizner's own home on [[Worth Avenue]] and [[Via Mizner]], Palm Beach: Villa Mizner.

'''Ali Fergani''' ({{lang-ar|'''علي فرقاني'''}}) (born September 21, 1952) is an Algerian [[Association football|football]] manager and former player. He currently manages the [[Algeria A' national football team]]. He played in the [[midfielder|midfield]] position as a playmaker.

==Career==
Fergani played club football for [[NA Hussein Dey]] and [[JS Kabylie|JE Tizi-Ouzou]]. Fergani played for the [[Algeria national football team]] at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Sports Reference|title=Ali Ferghani Biography and Statistics|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/fe/ali-fergani-1.html|accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also took part in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FIFA player|49326|Ali Fergani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Fergani came third in a run for an [[African Footballer of the Year]] award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[RSSSF]]|author=Pierrend, Jose Luis|title=African Player of the Year 1981|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/afrpoy81.html|accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his retirement, Fergani was appointed as an assistant manager of [[Algeria national football team]], as well as the coach of his former club [[JS Kabylie]]. His managing career took off to a good start as he won the [[1990 African Cup of Nations]] in his homeland. Fergani was re-appointed as the coach of [[Algeria national football team|Algeria national team]] in 1995, but was dismissed just one year later, after a defeat to [[Kenya national football team|Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[RSSSF]]|author=Mubarak, Hassanin|title=Algeria National Team Coaches|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/alg-coach.html|accessdate=2009-07-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090603012816/http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/alg-coach.html| archivedate= 3 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the national team, Fergani coached several [[Tunisia]]n sides, including [[Club Athletic Bizertin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cab-officiel.com/entraineurs |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112002621/http://www.cab-officiel.com/entraineurs |archive-date=2010-11-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Union Sportive Monastir]] and [[Stade Tunisien]], among others.

Following the resignation of [[Robert Waseige]], Fergani was once again recalled to the [[Algeria national football team]], as a manager.
Currently Fergani works as the manager of [[Tunisia]] [[CA Bizertin]].

On October 10, 2011, Fergani was appointed as manager of the [[Algeria A' national football team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzfoot.com/news-10052/en-a-ali-fergani-nouveau-selectionneur/ EN A' : Ali Fergani nouveau sélectionneur]; DZFoot.com, 10 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthony Foster''' (1705 – April 1779), of [[Collon]], [[County Louth]], was an [[Anglo-Irish]] politician and judge.

[[Image:FosterhouseCollon2002.jpg|thumb|Collon House, which Foster built around 1740]]

He was the eldest  son of [[John Foster of Dunleer|John Foster]], MP for Dunleer,  and  his wife Elizabeth Fortescue,  youngest  daughter of William Fortescue of Neuragh, who was  a member of the  Fortescue family which later held the title [[Earl of Clermont]].  The Fosters had come to Ireland from [[Cumberland]]  in the previous century, and  had gradually  acquired lands and political influence in Louth.   He was [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]] 1766-1777.  Prior to appointment to the Bench he  represented  the family constituency of [[Dunleer (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dunleer]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]] from 1738 to 1761 and subsequently [[Louth (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Louth]] from 1761 to 1767.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921'' John Murray London 1926 Vol.2 p.213&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He attended the school in Dublin run by [[Thomas Sheridan (divine)|Thomas Sheridan]], the friend of [[Jonathan Swift]] and grandfather of [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]].&lt;ref name="Ball p.214"&gt;Ball p.214&lt;/ref&gt; He matriculated from the [[University of Dublin]] in 1722 and took his degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1726. He entered [[Middle Temple]] in 1726 and was called to the [[Irish Bar]] in 1732.&lt;ref name="Ball p.214"/&gt; He became [[King's Counsel]] in 1760 and acted as counsel to the Board of Revenue; unlike many of his judicial colleagues he  never held office as  a Law Officer or as a  [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)|Serjeant-at-law]].

As a member of Parliament he worked tirelessly to promote the interests of the manufacturers of [[Irish linen]] ;&lt;ref name="Ball p.161"&gt;Ball p.161&lt;/ref&gt; there is no reason to doubt  the sincerity of his belief in this  cause  (it fits well with his known interest in the improvement of agriculture), although Elrington Ball rather cynically notes that  his support for the linen manufacturers brought him rich rewards, including a gold box. As an orator (which was  a much-prized skill among the Irish  public figures of his time) he was badly thought of,  being described as "slow,  sleepy and charmless".&lt;ref name="Ball p.161"/&gt;

==Family and personal life==
He married firstly Elizabeth Burgh, daughter of William Burgh&lt;ref name="Ball p.214"/&gt; in 1736; she died in 1744. They had three children:
* [[John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel]], the last Speaker of the Irish House of Commons.&lt;ref name="Ball p.214"/&gt;
* [[William Foster (bishop)|William Foster]], successively [[Bishop of Cork and Ross]], [[Bishop of Kilmore]] and [[Bishop of Clogher]].
* Margaret Foster who married [[Henry Maxwell (bishop)|Henry Maxwell]], successively [[Dean of Kilmore]], [[Bishop of Dromore]] and [[Bishop of Meath]].
He married secondly Elizabeth's cousin Dorothea Burgh, daughter of the celebrated architect  [[Thomas de Burgh]] and his wife Mary Smyth,  in 1749.&lt;ref name="Burkes"&gt;Burke's Peerage, see Massereene and Ferrard&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1stBaronOriel.jpg|thumb|right|150px|John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel, Anthony's eldest son and heir.]]

He built an impressive country seat, Collon House, which was much added to by his son and heir, John, Lord Oriel. Anthony had a keen interest in agricultural development, and   his improvements at Collon were described as being "of a magnitude never before attempted". Collon became famous for its great variety of trees and shrubs and its [[cider]]  orchard.

==Reputation==

Foster was not regarded as  the most outstanding lawyer on the Irish Bench in his lifetime, but it has been argued that he was its  most gifted member  overall, with his wide-ranging interests in law, politics, trade and agriculture. If he has been largely  forgotten, this may be because his reputation was eclipsed by that of his even more gifted son, John.

'''Artur Asilbekovich Beterbiev''' ({{lang-ru|Артур Асильбекович Бетербиев}}; born 21 January 1985) is a Russian [[professional boxer]] who has held the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[light-heavyweight]] title since 2017. As of June 2018, he is ranked as the world's seventh best active light-heavyweight by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine, and eighth by the [[Transnational Boxing Rankings Board]] and [[BoxRec]].

As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], Beterbiev won a silver medal at the [[2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships|2007 World Championships]], gold at the [[2009 World Amateur Boxing Championships|2009 World Championships]], as well as gold at the [[2006 European Amateur Boxing Championships|2006]] and [[2010 European Amateur Boxing Championships|2010 European Championships]], all in the light-heavyweight division. He also reached the quarter-finals of the [[heavyweight]] bracket at the [[2012 Olympics]].

Beterbiev is particularly known for his exceptional punching power, having scored all of his professional wins by [[knockout]] or [[technical knockout|stoppage]].&lt;ref&gt;Idec, Keith (23 December 2016). [http://www.boxingscene.com/beterbiev-stops-prieto-first-round-keep-ko-streak-intact--112049 "Beterbiev Stops Prieto in First Round to Keep KO Streak Intact"]. BoxingScene. Retrieved 24 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amateur career==
Beterbiev competed as a light-heavyweight and [[heavyweight]] in his [[amateur boxing|amateur]] career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Artur Beterbiyev Bio, Stats, and Results|url = https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/be/artur-beterbiyev-1.html|website = Olympics at Sports-Reference.com|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[2006 European Amateur Boxing Championships]] beating [[Kenneth Egan]] and [[Ismail Sillakh]] among others. He beat [[Egor Mekhontsev]] but lost to two-time world champion [[Evgeny Makarenko]] in 2006.{{Clarify|reason = At which competition?|date=September 2015}} In 2007 he beat future unified light-heavyweight champion [[Sergey Kovalev (boxer)|Sergey Kovalev]] in the semi-finals, and eventually beat [[Evgeny Makarenko]] in finals to qualify for the World Championships. In the finals of the World Championships he faced the little-known [[Abbos Atoev]] but lost in an upset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aiba.org/documents/site1/wch_chicago/C74E49.pdf |title=AIBA World Boxing Championships Chicago 2007 Results |date= |accessdate=24 September 2015 |website= |publisher=AIBA |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613104556/http://aiba.org/documents/site1/wch_chicago/C74E49.pdf |archivedate=June 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Olympics 2008]] he beat [[Kennedy Katende]] 15:3 then fell controversially to local boxer [[Zhang Xiaoping]] who went on to win the gold medal.

In Milan he beat young Cuban [[Jose Larduet]] and Uzbek [[Elshod Rasulov]] for the 2009 world championship title.

At the [[2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships|2011 World Championships]] he lost to eventual winner [[Oleksandr Usyk]] by 13–17. At the [[2012 Olympics]] he edged out Michael Hunter but lost again by 13–17 to Usyk. Both of these were in the heavyweight division.

==Professional career==
===Early career===
Beterbiev moved to [[Montreal]] to pursue a professional career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groupeyvonmichel.ca/eng/boxers/artur_beterbiev-eng.html|title=Artur Beterbiev - GYM|first=Mondial|last=Web|website=www.groupeyvonmichel.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won his professional debut via a second-round [[technical knockout|TKO]] over Christian Cruz at the [[Bell Centre]] on July 8, 2013. Beterbiev fought on the undercard of [[Jean Pascal vs. Lucian Bute]], beating Gabriel Lecrosnier by TKO on the fourth round.

===North American champion===
====Beterbiev vs. Cloud====
After winning his first five professional bouts, Beterbiev would face off against former [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[light-heavyweight]] champion [[Tavoris Cloud]] for the vacant [[North American Boxing Association|NABA]] title on September 27, 2014. After a tentative opening minute from both fighters, Beterbiev opened up and began landing powerful shots that visibly rocked Cloud. In the final minute, the Russian would drop his opponent three times via combinations. Before this fight, Cloud had never been dropped in his professional career.  Beterbiev would close the show in round two, landing multiple hard shots to the head that knocked Cloud out, giving Beterbiev his first title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/dan-rafael/post/_/id/10524/beterbiev-dominates-stops-cloud|title=Beterbiev dominates, stops Cloud|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Beterbiev vs. Page, Campillo====
On December 2014, Beterbiev stopped light heavyweight prospect Jeff Page Jr. in two rounds, winning the vacant IBF North American and [[North American Boxing Organization|NABO]] light-heavyweight titles. However, Beterbiev was dropped for the first time in a professional fight in the first stanza of the fight. "I felt a bit sleepy before the fight. I think I just lost my concentration for a fraction of a second," Beterbiev said of the knockdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2014/12/19/7425761/artur-beterbiev-gets-off-canvas-stops-jeff-page-in-round-two|title=Beterbiev dropped, but stops Page in two|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Beterbiev would face off against another former IBF world champion, [[Gabriel Campillo]], with his North American title at stake. Both men began cautiously until Beterbiev dropped Campillo late in the first round. The Russian slowly wore down his foe with multiple straight rights to the body. Finally in the fourth, Beterbiev would land a straight/uppercut hybrid that would hit Campillo square on the chin, and followed it up with a perfunctory left hook before walking to his corner while his opponent slid to the canvas, barely conscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2015/4/4/8345149/pbc-on-cbs-results-artur-beterbiev-smashes-gabriel-campillo-in-four|title=Beterbiev smashes Campillo in four|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PSI detector in his gloves stated that the first punch landed with 973 [[pounds per square inch]]{{cn|date=November 2017}}.

Beterbiev improved his record to 9-0 against Alexander Johnson on June 12, 2015 at the UIC Pavilion in [[Chicago]]. Beterbiev knocked Johnson down twice in the fifth and a third time in the seventh before finishing him at 1:38 of the round, clobbering him with a left hook and finishing him off with a overhand right that put Johnson through the ropes down and out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierboxingchampions.com/beterbiev-vs-johnson|title=Beterbiev vs Johnson Results &amp; Highlights - Jun 12, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the win, Beterbiev added the vacant [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] International light-heavyweight title to his other four minor titles.

On June 2016, Beterbiev defeated [[Ezequiel Maderna]] by round 4 TKO, dropping him four times along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierboxingchampions.com/news/beterbiev-turns-power-gain-fourth-round-tko-maderna|title=Beterbiev turns up the power to gain fourth-round TKO of Maderna|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beterbiev's eleventh professional win came against Isidro Prieto, whom he knocked out after a flurry of punches at the end of the first round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2016/12/24/14075128/artur-beterbiev-destroys-isidro-prieto-in-one|title=Beterbiev crushes Prieto in one|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beterbiev had several title eliminators and world title shots fall through, including bouts against [[Sullivan Barrera]], [[Igor Mikhalkin]], and [[Sergey Kovalev (boxer)|Sergey Kovalev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/beterbiev-barrera-alvarez-chilemba-double-november--96114|title=Beterbiev-Barrera, Alvarez-Chilemba Double in November?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/13935493/shoulder-injury-knocks-artur-beterbiev-world-title-elimination-fight|title=Beterbiev (shoulder) out of world title eliminator|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/dan-rafael/post/_/id/13647/no-kovalev-beterbiev-no-surprise|title=No Kovalev-Beterbiev?

===Beterbiev vs. Kölling===
On July 2017, Beterbiev had yet another world title eliminator fall through. He was scheduled to face [[Enrico Kölling]], with the winner becoming the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]]'s mandatory challenger to unified world champion [[Andre Ward]], but the fight was never finalized amidst Beterbiev's contract dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2017/7/19/15997836/artur-beterbiev-enrico-koelling-canceled|title=Beterbiev’s title eliminator with Koelling canceled|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[purse bid]] was later won by [[Top Rank]], with the American promotion planning to broadcast the fight on [[ESPN]], as part of a show including [[Jessie Magdaleno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/20155415/top-rank-wins-purse-bid-artur-beterbiev-enrico-koelling-world-title-eliminator|title=Top Rank wins purse bid to Beterbiev-Koelling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was later announced to be taking place on November 11 at the [[Save Mart Arena]] in [[Fresno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2017/9/14/16309754/jessie-magdaleno-artur-beterbiev-set-for-november-11th-espn-show|title=Magdaleno, Beterbiev set for 11/11 ESPN show|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magdaleno would later drop out with an injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2017/10/8/16444160/jessie-magdaleno-injured-out-of-november-11-fight|title=Jessie Magdaleno injured, out of November 11 fight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andre Ward officially announced his retirement on September, therefore the IBF title became vacant. The IBF later announced that the fight between Beterbiev and Kölling would be for the now-vacant world title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/20850651/artur-beterbiev-enrico-koelling-elimination-bout-upgraded-fight-vacant-world-title|title=Beterbiev-Koelling upgraded to world title fight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beterbiev dominated Kölling in a dull fight, walking him down while Kölling refused to engage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2017/11/12/16639142/top-rank-on-espn-results-jose-ramirez-artur-beterbiev-win-in-fresno|title=Top Rank on ESPN results: Jose Ramirez, Artur Beterbiev win in Fresno|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beterbiev finally scored a knockdown in round 12, as Kölling went down on one knee and received a count. When the fight resumed, Beterbiev dropped Kölling again and the referee waved the fight off. Beterbiev landed 322 of 1,111 punches (29 percent) while Kölling landed 64 of 252 blows (25 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/21380616/artur-beterbiev-stops-enrico-koelling-wins-vacant-light-heavyweight-title|title=Beterbiev stops Koelling, wins vacant light heavyweight title|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Beterbiev was born in [[Khasavyurt]], [[Dagestan]], and is of [[Chechen people|Chechen]] descent. He currently resides in his adopted hometown of [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. Beterbiev is a [[Muslim]], and married with three children; a son and two daughters.

[[File:Dernbach Ba 2001.jpeg|thumb|Prince-abbot Balthasar von Dernbach]]
'''Balthasar von Dernbach''' (1548 &amp;ndash; 15 March 1606), was a Benedictine monk of [[Fulda monastery]] and its Prince-Abbot from 1570 to 1606.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Family==
Balthasar was born into a branch (''called Graul'') of the ''von Dernbach'' family, a family of knights traceable to the 13th century in the vicinity of Giessen and Herborn as liegemen of the [[List of rulers of Hesse|landgraves of Hesse]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Born in 1548 in Wiesenfeld, [[Hesse]], Balthasar was the youngest son of the fifteen children of Peter von Dernbach and his wife, Clara Klauer von und zu Wohra. Balthasar was baptized into the [[Lutheran]] church, although his father's religious leanings have been described as either "staunchly Lutheran" and the "only Catholic" in Hesse. A liegeman of [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse]], Peter von Dernbach fought in the [[Schmalkaldic War]] of 1546/47 despite adopting a critical attitude towards Philip's religious policies.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Fulda monastery==
When Balthasar's father died in 1560, his mother sent the 12-year-old youth to [[Fulda monastery]], where her brother, Wilhelm Hartmann Klauer von und zu Wohra, was prince-abbot. There, Balthasar was raised a Catholic, In 1566, he was ordained a priest in [[Würzburg]]. In 1570, he was elected his uncle's successor as prince-abbot and confirmed in that position by [[Pope Pius V]]. As abbot, Balthasar helped his brothers Otto, Melchior, and Wilhelm attain high office. Otto became marshal-provost at Petersberg, Melchior a marshal-bailiff at Brückenau and William became commander of the [[Teutonic Knights]] at Kapfenburg und Oettingen. Melchior's son, [[Peter Philipp von Dernbach|Peter Philip]], entered the service of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg]] and later became himself Prince-Bishop of Bamberg and Würzburg.&lt;ref&gt;Horst W. Müller. ''Dernbach und die „von Dernbach“.'' In: ''Hinterländer Geschichtsblätter.'' Bd. 84, Nr. 3, 2005, {{ISSN|0018-196X}}, S. 137–141, Nr. 4, S. 149–152; Bd. 85, 2006, Nr. 1, S. 153–155, Nr. 2, S. 162–167.&lt;!-- publishing info, ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counter-Reformation==
Balthasar immediately adopted a policy of [[counterreformation]]. In 1571 he called in the [[Jesuits]] to found a school and college. He insisted that the members of the chapter should return to a monastic form of life. Whereas his predecessors had tolerated [[Protestantism]], resulting in most of the citizenry of Fulda and a large portion of the principality's countryside professing Lutheranism, Balthasar ordered his subjects either to return to the Catholic faith or leave his territories.&lt;ref name="counterreform1"&gt;Otto Schaffrath. ''Fürstabt Balthasar von Dermbach und seine Zeit. Studien zur Geschichte der Gegenreformation in Fulda'' (= ''Veröffentlichung des Fuldaer Geschichtsvereins''. Bd. 44, {{ZDB|517272-x}}). Parzeller, Fulda 1967, mit umfangreicher Literaturübersicht.{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Exile and return==
These measures were resisted by the chapter, the magistrates and the knights. After Balthasar repeatedly ignored threats of violence, the knights allied themselves to [[Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn]], prince-bishop of neighbouring Würzburg. In 1576, the combined opposition forced Balthasar at Hammelburg to sign a letter of abdication and made Julius Echter administrator on the condition that he would tolerate the knights' religion. Balthasar fled to the [[Archbishop of Mainz]], who gave him Castle Bieberstein as residence.&lt;ref name="counterreform2"&gt;Gerrit Walther. Abt Balthasars Mission: Politische Mentalitäten, Gegenreformation und eine Adelsverschwörung im Hochstift Fulda. Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht 2002.{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="counterreform3"&gt;Friedrich Wilhelm Bautz: Balthasar von Dernbach. In: Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon (BBKL). Band 1, Bautz, Hamm 1975. 2., unveränderte Auflage Hamm 1990; {{ISBN|3-88309-013-1}}, Sp. 359.{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="counterreform4"&gt;Franz Xaver von Wegele: Balthasar, Fürstabt von Fulda. In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB). Band 2, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Leipzig 1875, S. 24–27.{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balthasar revoked his abdication and sent complaints to [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian II]] and [[Pope Gregory XIII]] to be reinstated. The Pope threatened Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn with excommunication if he refused to relinquish his claim to Fulda, but the latter insisted on the matter being settled by lawsuit, which would last more than a quarter century. In 1602, the [[Aulic Council]] reinstated Balthasar and sentenced the chapter, the knights and the cities to pay a fine and the expenses of the proceedings. Upon his return, Balthasar continued his policy of counter-reformation and achieved a complete restoration of Catholicism in the city and the principality.&lt;ref name="counterreform1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="counterreform2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="counterreform3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="counterreform4"/&gt;

==Witch trials==
After 1602, he ordered [[Fulda witch trials|witch trials]]. These were presided over by Balthasar Nuss, who had attached himself to the abbot during his exile and now was appointed Zentgraf of Hofbiebe and Malefizmeister. These trials resulted in the deaths of approximately 250 people. After Balthasar's death in 1606, Nuss was arrested by the new prince-abbott and spent 12 years in prison before being beheaded in 1618.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-protokolle.de/Lexikon/Balthasar_Nuss.html Profile], uni-protokolle.de; accessed 21 April 2015.{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==
Dr. Bloom researches the mechanisms of immune protection against tuberculosis, as an investigator in a [[Bill and Melinda Gates Grand Challenges|Bill and Melinda Gates Grand Challenge]] grant&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatesfoundation.org/what-we-do Gates Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandchallenges.org/Pages/Default.aspx Grand Challenges in Global Health]&lt;/ref&gt; with Professor David Edwards the [[Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]], where they study nanoparticle technology to deliver needle-free spray-drying aerosol vaccines against experimental tuberculosis. This vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial killing mechanism is effective against ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' and is found in human macrophages, and is unrelated to oxygen or nitrogen radicals.  This may explain the greater susceptibility of people of African and Asian descent to tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2005/08.25/00-gates.html Powell, A.

Maharajadhiraj Mirza Maharao '''Bharmalji II''' (reign: 6 November 1814 − 25 March 1819) was the [[Rao of Cutch]] belonging to [[Jadeja]] [[Rajput]] dynasty, who ascended the throne of [[Princely State of Cutch]] one month after the death of his father [[Rayadhan III]].

==Reign==
The Kutch was governed by [[Bar Bhayat ni Jamat]] since death of [[Rayadhan III]] and his regent [[Fateh Muhammad]] in 1813. Husain Miyan and his brother Ibrahim Miyan, succeeded Fateh Muhammad, their councils being directed by their father's chief adviser, Jagjivan Mehta, a [[Nagar Brahmin]].{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 1880 |page=155-156}}  As Rayadhan had no legitimate children, Ladhubha, his brother's son, a boy eleven years old, had in 1809, in the negotiations with the [[British East India Company|British Government]], been considered heir. But on the Rao's death, the two brothers, Husain Miyan and Ibrahim Miyan, supported the claim of Mansingji his illegitimate son.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 1880 |page=156}}

On the 13 January 1814, Mansingji succeeded to the chiefship of Kutch with the title of Maharajadhiraj Mirza Maharao Bharmalji II. The British Government agent Captain MacMurdo went from Morvi to Bhuj in 1814 for presenting its demands to Husain Miyan regarding end of piracy in [[Arabian sea]] and bandits in Vagad region.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 1880 |page=157}} Rao Bharmal II took over the management of state and Husain Miyan retired in  January 1815 under the acceptance of the feifdom of Anjar, Bhachau, Bhadargad and Kanthkot. Rao chose as ministers Shivraj of Mandvi and Askarn.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 1880 |page=158}}

On the 14 December, the force under Colonel East consisting of about 4000 fighting men, together with the troops of Gaekwad of [[Baroda State]], crossed the Rann at Venasa about twelve miles east of Anjar. The force moved on Anjar, and as Husain Miyan refused to let the British occupy it, the fort was attacked on the morning of the 25 December 1815, and before evening was surrendered. Its port of Tuna was occupied on the next day. A few days later, Muhammad Sota, the chief of Mundra, negotiated and agreed to the British. The force next moved towards Bhuj, encamping at Lakond on the 3 January 1816. On the 14 January 1816, the Rao Bharmal II agreed to the [[suzerainty]] of the British and Captain [[James MacMurdo]] was appointed as the British Resident at Bhuj and Collector of Anjar.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 1880 |page=158}}

With support of some Jadeja chiefs, the British troops attacked Bhuj on 25 March 1819, and disposed Rao Bharmal II{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 1880 |page=162}} and his son [[Deshalji II]], a minor was made the ruler of Cutch State. Kutch accepted the suzerainty of British in 1819 and Captain [[James MacMurdo]] was posted as British Political Resident stationed at [[Bhuj]]. During his minority the affairs of the State were managed by Council of Regency, which was composed of Jadeja chiefs and headed by Captain MacMurdo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=_YvOTYXzJdHirAen4vTCCg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=d16gAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Deshalji+II+of+Kutch&amp;q=Deshalji+II+#search_anchor] Bhuj:art, architecture, history.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uqconnect.net/~zzhsoszy/ips/misc/kutch_tree.html Jadeja Rulers of Kutch : Deshalji II (1814-1860)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613165408/http://uqconnect.net/~zzhsoszy/ips/misc/kutch_tree.html |date=2011-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uqconnect.net/~zzhsoszy/ips/k/kutch.html Kutch State : Maharao DESALJI BHARMALJI II (Daishalji) 1819/1860] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605032616/http://uqconnect.net/~zzhsoszy/ips/k/kutch.html |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5639">'''Cheryl McKenzie''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] broadcast journalist, Host and Producer of [[Anishinabek]] and [[Cree]] descent. She is best known as the host of the [[Aboriginal People's Television Network|Aboriginal People's Television Network's]] half hour nightly news show [[APTN National News]], and the talk Show [[APTN National News|InFocus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/new-host-and-producer-for-aptn-national-news/1001096853/ New Host and Producer For APTN National News  in Broadcaster Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Both McKenzie's parents are [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]] survivors.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lauren McKeon, [http://j-source.ca/article/leading-way Leading the way], J-source. October 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmg.ca/en/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CRTC-2013-19-APTNrenewal.pdf Canadian Media Guild Building APTN to last in a changing Canada, Feb 27, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

They are from the Hollow Water and [[Peguis First Nation]]s in [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aptn.ca/corporate/Media_Releases/media-releases-2012-04-23 Announcing New Host and Producer For APTN National, News Media Release]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheryl McKenzie grew up in [[Winnipeg]], but frequently visited family on her parents' reserves.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
Cheryl's first career was as a chef. She worked in Winnipeg's #1 ranked restaurant, Amici, when she was still a teenager, aged 19.  The grueling work schedule proved difficult after Cheryl became a single mother, and so she returned to school at the [[University of Winnipeg]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

McKenzie originally enrolled in political science, but was frustrated that the course excluded indigenous peoples.  She switched her major and graduated with a degree in Philosophy in 1998.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Career==

===CBC Radio===
Cheryl briefly interned at [[CBC radio]] Winnipeg in 2000.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt; [https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheryl-mckenzie-395b9a10 Cheryl McKenzie], Linked in Profile.&lt;/ref&gt;
The internship ended after 10 months when the funding ran out. Also, her superiors at CBC told her they didn't think she would be successful as a journalist.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===APTN===
In 2001 Cheryl landed a job as a reporter at the Aboriginal People's Television Network's weekly news show, [[APTN National News|InVision]], which was rebranded into [[APTN National News]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 2004 McKenzie earned award nominations at the [[Gemini Awards|Geminis]] and  the [[Canadian Association of Broadcasters]] for an investigative series of reports into the lives of First Nations people who became ill and in some cases died from asbestos-related illness after their homes were contaminated by the [[Department of Aboriginal Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmg.ca/In%20support%20of%20APTN's%20licence%20renewal.pdf Canadian Media Guild In support of APTN's license renewal], May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blogtalkradio.com/nativetrailblazers/2015/01/10/cheryl-mckenzie--aptn-producer-and-television-host Cheryl McKenzie - APTN Producer and Television Host], Native Trailblazers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===APTN Daytime===

In July 2005 McKenzie was promoted to Host/Producer for the launch of APTN National News: Daytime a second national half hour newscast.

===APTN Contact===

McKenzie assumed the role of host producer on the APTN national call-in show [[APTN National News|Contact]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Rickwood, [http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/new-season-scores-with-space-and-sex/1000215511/ New Season Scores with Space and Sex Comedy Continues Amid Dramatic Dearth], Broadcaster, 2007-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

===APTN National News and InFocus===
A new talk format show, APTN InFocus, replaced Contact in 2009, with McKenzie at the forefront as the host-producer.

McKenzie reappeared on news, this time on the desk as a co-anchor with Michael Hutchison in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/aptn-national-news-unveils-fall-lineup/1001650647/ APTN National News Unveils Fall Lineup], Broadcaster Magazine, 2012-08-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2014, InFocus reverted to a half hour show. Topics have included: suicide rates, addiction, mental health issues, low-income, community violence, high incarceration rates, and self-governance struggles.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

APTN InFocus reformatted again in 2016, becoming a one-hour show, interactive as Contact had been but with a new focus on social media. The first episode on June 3, 2016 featured Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a guest. It was the first time a serving Prime Minister ever gave a sit-down interview to an  Indigenous media organization. Trudeau took question via telephone and Twitter for an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/world/americas/aptn-a-tv-voice-for-largely-ignored-indigenous-canadians.html?_r=0|title=APTN, a TV Voice for Largely Ignored Indigenous Canadians|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current design of the show usually features a three guest panel, and allows viewers to join the conversation via telephone Twitter or Facebook.

==Biography==
'''Clara Dan''' was born in Hungary in 1919 or 1920.  She was an actress and cabaret performer,&lt;ref name=zoom/&gt; appearing at the [[National Theatre (Budapest)|National]] and [[Comedy Theatre of Budapest|Vig]] (Comedy) Theatres in [[Budapest]], both before and after World War II.  Her first husband of only six months was sent to a Soviet labour camp and she never saw him again.&lt;ref name=zoom&gt;[http://www.zoominfo.com/#!search/profile/person?personId=599216825&amp;targetid=profile zoominfo]&lt;/ref&gt;  While on a one-woman tour of Romania in 1947 she met another Hungarian, [[Peter Abeles]], then a cabaret entrepreneur, and they married.&lt;ref name=zoom/&gt;  They left Hungary for a better life, and lived in Rome, London and Paris before migrating to [[Australia]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/28/business/peter-abeles-75-a-leader-in-australia-s-business-world.html ''New York Times'', Obituary of Sir Peter Abeles, 28 June 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;  She was naturalised an Australian citizen in November 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12642866 Sun-Herald, 28 November 1954]&lt;/ref&gt;

She and Peter Abeles adopted two daughters.&lt;ref name=zoom/&gt; After her divorce from Abeles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55477146 ''Australian Women's Weekly'', 13 July 1977]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1976 she set up the Cladan Cultural Institute of Australia, a private philanthropic body that acts as the funding body for the [[Sydney International Piano Competition|Sydney International Piano Competition of Australia]] (SIPCA).&lt;ref name=smh/&gt;&lt;ref name=tink/&gt;  She founded the competition in association with [[Rex Hobcroft]], the then Director of the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music]], and with support from the New South Wales Government, then headed by [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]] [[Neville Wran]].&lt;ref name=tink/&gt;  SIPCA was first held in 1977 and soon became one of the world's most prestigious classical piano competitions.

Claire Dan was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE), and in 1986 a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM), in recognition of her service to the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=870095&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true It's an Honour: AM]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyrus Roberts Vance''' (March 27, 1917{{spaced ndash}}January 12, 2002) was an [[United States|American]] lawyer and [[United States Secretary of State]] under President [[Jimmy Carter]] from 1977 to 1980.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Prior to that position he was the [[Secretary of the Army]]&lt;ref name="bell1992"&gt;{{cite book|chapter="Cyrus Roberts Vance"|chapterurl=http://www.history.army.mil/books/sw-sa/Vance.htm|year=1992|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]|accessdate=September 22, 2007|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/sw-sa/SWSA-Fm.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214152450/http://www.history.army.mil/books/Sw-SA/SWSA-Fm.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 14, 2007|title=Secretaries of War and Secretaries of the Army: Portraits and Biographical Sketches|first=William Gardner|last=Bell}}&lt;!-- both the links are dead --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]].

As Secretary of State, Vance approached foreign policy with an emphasis on negotiation over conflict and a special interest in [[arms reduction]]. In April 1980, Vance resigned in protest of [[Operation Eagle Claw]], the secret mission to rescue [[Iran hostage crisis|American hostages in Iran]]. He was succeeded in the position by [[Edmund Muskie]].

Vance was the cousin (and adoptive son) of [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924 Democratic presidential nominee]] and lawyer [[John W. Davis]]. He was the father of [[Manhattan District Attorney]] [[Cyrus Vance Jr.]]

==Early life and family==
Vance was born on March 27, 1917, in [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]].&lt;ref name = "WVDCH1"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.wvculture.org/vrr/va_bcdetail.aspx?Id=199260 | title = Birth Record Detail: Cyrus Roberts Vance | work = West Virginia Vital Research Records | publisher = West Virginia Division of Culture and History | accessdate = August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of John Carl Vance II and his wife Amy Roberts Vance, and had an older brother, John Carl Vance III.&lt;ref name = "WVDCH1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "WVDCH2"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.wvculture.org/vrr/va_bcdetail.aspx?Id=97166 | title = Birth Record Detail: John Carl III Vance | work = West Virginia Vital Research Records | publisher = West Virginia Division of Culture and History | accessdate = August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Vance's birth, his family relocated to [[Bronxville, New York]], so that his father could commute to [[Manhattan]], where he was an insurance broker.&lt;ref name = "Mihalkanin1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mihalkanin|2004|p=512.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vance's father was also a landowner and worked for a government agency during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="bell1992"/&gt; He died unexpectedly of [[pneumonia]] in 1922.&lt;ref name="bell1992"/&gt; Vance's mother was Amy Roberts Vance, who had a prominent family history in [[Philadelphia]] and was active in civic affairs.&lt;ref name="bell1992"/&gt; Following her husband's death, she moved her family to Switzerland for a year, where Vance and his brother learned French at L'Institut Sillig in [[Vevey]].&lt;ref name = "Mihalkanin1"/&gt;

Vance's cousin [[John W. Davis]], an [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] and [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924 United States presidential candidate]], became his mentor and adopted him.&lt;ref name = "Harbaugh1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harbaugh|1973|pp=389–390.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vance graduated from [[Kent School]] in 1935&lt;ref name="bell1992"/&gt; and earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1939 from [[Yale College]],&lt;ref name="bell1992"/&gt; where he was a member of the secret society [[Scroll and Key]]. He also earned three [[varsity letter]]s in [[ice hockey]] at Yale. He graduated from [[Yale Law School]] in 1942.&lt;ref name="bell1992"/&gt;  While there, Vance's classmates included [[Sargent Shriver]], [[William Scranton]], [[Stanley Rogers Resor]], and [[William Bundy]], all of whom he would later work with.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Vance entered the military during [[World War II]], serving in the [[United States Navy]] as a gunnery officer on the [[destroyer]] [[USS Hale (DD-642)|USS ''Hale'' (DD-642)]] until 1946. He saw sea action in the [[Battle of Tarawa]], the [[Battle of Saipan]], the [[Battle of Guam (1944)]], the [[Bougainville Campaign]], and the [[Philippines Campaign (1944–1945)]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  After the war, he worked for the [[Mead Corporation]] for a year before joining the law firm [[Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

At the age of 29, Vance married Grace Elsie "Gay" Sloane on February 15, 1947. She was a [[Bryn Mawr College]] graduate and was the daughter of the board chairman of the [[W. &amp; J. Sloane]] furniture company in New York City. They had five children:
* Elsie Nicoll Vance
* Amy Sloane Vance
* Grace Roberts Vance
* Camilla Vance Holmes
* [[Cyrus R. Vance, Jr.]]

==Political career==
In 1957, Senator [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] asked Vance to leave Wall Street to work for the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services]], where he helped draft the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]], leading to the [[creation of NASA]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In 1961, Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] recruited Vance to become [[General Counsel of the Department of Defense]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was then made the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] by President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="bell1992"/&gt; He was Secretary when Army units were sent to northern [[Mississippi]] in 1962 to [[Ole Miss riot of 1962|protect James Meredith]] and ensure that the [[Court order|court-ordered]] [[Racial integration|integration]] of the [[University of Mississippi]] took place.&lt;ref name="bell1992"/&gt;

In 1964, Vance became the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]] and now-President Johnson sent Vance to the [[Panama Canal Zone]] after [[Martyrs' Day (Panama)|student riots]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  After the [[1967 Detroit riot]], President Johnson sent Vance to Michigan.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  Vance next attempted to delay the [[Cyprus dispute]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  In 1968, President Johnson sent Vance to [[South Korea]] to deal with the {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} hostage situation.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Vance first [[Joint warfare in South Vietnam 1963–1969|supported the Vietnam War]] but by the late 1960s changed his views and resigned from office, advising the president to pull out of [[South Vietnam]].  Vance served as a deputy to [[W. Averell Harriman]] during the [[Paris Peace Accords]], which stalled due to the involvement of presidential candidate [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  Vance called the failed peace talks "one of the great tragedies in history".&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  He received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="bell1992"/&gt;

[[File:Vance Carter 1977.gif|left|thumb|250px|Secretary of State Vance talks with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] on the [[White House]] lawn in March 1977.]]
[[File:The Shah with Atherton, Sullivan, Vance, Carter and Brzezinski, 1977.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah of Iran]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] meeting with [[Alfred Leroy Atherton]], [[William H. Sullivan]], Vance, President [[Jimmy Carter]], and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] in 1977]]
President [[Jimmy Carter]] initially wanted to nominate [[George Ball (diplomat)|George Ball]] to become  [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], but, fearing Ball was too liberal to be confirmed, nominated Vance instead.&lt;ref name=NYTmag&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Douglas Brinkley]]|title=THE LIVES THEY LIVED; Out of the Loop|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-out-of-the-loop.html|accessdate=3 May 2017|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=29 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vance played an integral role as the administration negotiated the [[Panama Canal Treaties]], along with peace talks in [[Rhodesia]], [[Namibia]] and [[South Africa]].  He worked closely with Israeli Ministers [[Moshe Dayan]] and [[Ezer Weizman]] to secure the [[Camp David Accords]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Vance insisted that the President make [[Paul Warnke]] Director of the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]], over strong opposition by Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Vance also pushed for closer ties to the [[Soviet Union]], and clashed frequently with the more hawkish [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]. Vance tried to advance arms limitations by working on the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II]] agreement with the Soviet Union, which he saw as the central diplomatic issue of the time, but Brzezinski lobbied for a tougher more assertive policy vis-a-vis the Soviets. He argued for strong condemnation of Soviet activity in Africa and in the Third World as well as successfully lobbying for normalized relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1978. As Brzezinski took control of the negotiations, Vance was marginalized and his influence began to wane. When revolution erupted in Iran in late 1978, the two were divided on how to support the United States' ally the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]]. Vance argued in favor of reforms while Brzezinski urged him to crack down – the 'iron fist' approach. Unable to receive a direct course of action from Carter, the mixed messages that the shah received from Vance and Brzezinski contributed to his confusion and indecision as he fled Iran in January 1979 and his [[Iranian Revolution|regime collapsed]].

Vance negotiated the [[SALT II]] agreement directly with Soviet Ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin]], bypassing American Ambassador [[Malcolm Toon]], who then criticized the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Richard|title=Malcolm Toon Made Waves as a Diplomat, but His Death Went Largely Unreported|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/world/europe/malcolm-toon-dead-us-ambassador-to-soviet-union.html|accessdate=3 May 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 May 2017|page=B14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 1978, President Carter and Soviet General Secretary [[Leonid Brezhnev]] signed the treaty in Vienna's [[Hofburg]] Imperial Palace in front of the international press but the Senate ultimately did not ratify it.

After the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] on December 27, 1979, Vance's opposition to what he had called "visceral anti-Sovietism" lead to a rapid reduction of his stature.&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt;  Vance's attempt to surreptitiously negotiate a solution to the [[Iran hostage crisis]] with Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] through the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] failed badly.&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt;  Believing that diplomatic initiatives could see the hostages safely returned home, Vance initially fought off attempts by Brzezinski to pursue a military solution.  Vance, struggling with [[gout]], went to Florida on Thursday, April 10, 1980, for a long weekend.&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt;  On Friday, the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] held a newly scheduled meeting and authorized [[Operation Eagle Claw]], a military expedition into Tehran to rescue the hostages.&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt;  Deputy Secretary [[Warren Christopher]], who attended the meeting in Vance's place, did not inform Vance.&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt;

Furious, Vance handed in his resignation on principle, calling Brzezinski "evil".&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt; The only Secretaries of State who had previously resigned in protest were [[Lewis Cass]], who resigned in the buildup to the Civil War, and [[William Jennings Bryan]], who resigned in the buildup to World War I.&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt;

President Carter aborted the operation after only five of the eight helicopters he had sent into the [[Dasht-e Kavir]] desert arrived in operational condition. As U.S. forces prepared to depart from the staging area, a helicopter collided with a transport plane, causing a fire that killed eight servicemen.&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt;  Vance's resignation was confirmed several days later, and he was replaced by Senator [[Edmund Muskie]]. A second rescue mission was planned but never carried out, and the diplomatic efforts to negotiate the release of the hostages were handed over to Deputy Secretary Christopher. The hostages were released during the [[first inauguration of Ronald Reagan]], after 444 days in captivity.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://chriswallisblog.wordpress.com/cyrus-r-vance/ "Cyrus R. Vance", ChrisWallisBlog.Wordpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career in law and as Special Envoy==
In May 1970, Vance was appointed to serve as a commissioner in a landmark panel known as the [[Knapp Commission]], which was formed and tasked by New York City Mayor [[John V. Lindsay]] with investigating systemic corruption at the [[New York Police Department]]. The Knapp Commission held televised hearings into police corruption and issued a final report of its findings in 1972. The work of the Knapp Commission led to the prosecution of police officers on charges of corruption and culminated in significant, if short-lived, reforms and oversight in respect of the police department, including the appointment of a temporary special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute corruption committed by NYPD officers, district attorneys, and judges.

From 1974 to 1976, Vance served as president of the [[New York City Bar Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www2.nycbar.org/vancecenter/index.php/who-we-are/cyrus-r-vance |title=The Legacy of Cyrus R. Vance |publisher=New York City Bar - Vance Center |date= |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vance returned to his law practice at [[Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett]] in 1980, but was repeatedly called back to public service throughout the 1980s and 1990s, participating in diplomatic missions to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Croatia]], and [[South Africa]].  Vance helped negotiate the dispute over the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In 1991, he was named [[Special Envoy]] of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] for Croatia and proposed the [[Vance plan]] for solution of [[Croatian War of Independence|conflict in Croatia]]. Authorities of [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] agreed to Vance's plan, but the leaders of [[SAO Krajina]] rejected it, even though it offered Serbs quite a large degree of autonomy by the rest of the world's standards, as it did not include full independence for Krajina. He continued his work as member of [[Z-4 plan|Zagreb 4 group]]. The plan they drafted, named [[Z-4 plan|Z-4]], was effectively superseded when Croatian forces retook the Krajina region ([[Operation Storm]]) in 1995.

In January 1993, as the [[United Nations]] Special Envoy to Bosnia, Vance and Lord [[David Owen]], the [[European Union|EU]] representative, began negotiating a [[Peace plans offered before and during the Bosnian War#Vance-Owen|peace plan]] for the ending the [[War in Bosnia]]. The plan was rejected, and Vance announced his resignation as Special Envoy to the UN Secretary-General. He was replaced by Norwegian Foreign Minister [[Thorvald Stoltenberg]].

In 1997, he was made the original honorary chair of the [[American Iranian Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Khoda Hafez |url=http://www.american-iranian.org/sites/default/files/aicupdates/9._aic_update_issue_no._91_.html |title=A Message from AIC on the Occasion of the New Year |publisher=American Iranian Council |date= |access-date=September 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614005654/http://american-iranian.org/sites/default/files/aicupdates/9._aic_update_issue_no._91_.html |archivedate=June 14, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6180">'''Robert Hamill''' was an Irish [[Catholic]] civilian who was beaten to death by a [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] mob in [[Portadown]], [[County Armagh]], [[Northern Ireland]]. Hamill and his friends were attacked on 27 April 1997 on the town's main street. It has been claimed that the local [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC), parked a short distance away, did nothing to stop the attack. At the time of the murder, tension between loyalists (mainly [[Protestants]]) and [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] (mainly Catholics) was high, mostly due to the ongoing [[Drumcree conflict|Drumcree parade dispute]].

==Death==
Hamill and his friends were attacked by a group of loyalists while walking home from St. Patrick's dance hall at about 1.30 a.m on 27 April 1997.&lt;ref name="cory-collusion-report-robert-hamill"&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/collusion/cory/cory03hamill.pdf Cory Collusion Report Robert Hamill]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amnesty-report-robert-hamill"&gt;[http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR450311999?open&amp;of=ENG-GBR The Sectarian Killing of Robert Hamill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906172332/http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR450311999?open&amp;of=ENG-GBR |date=2009-09-06 }}, [[Amnesty International]], 1 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; After walking along Market Street from the dance hall, they came to the intersection of Market and Thomas Streets in Portadown, where they were attacked.&lt;ref name="cory-collusion-report-robert-hamill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amnesty-report-robert-hamill"/&gt; Hamill and his friend,  Gregory Girvan, were kicked by the crowd while their attackers shouted abuse at them and Robert Hamill was knocked unconscious almost immediately.&lt;ref name="amnesty-report-robert-hamill"/&gt; Girvan's wife and sister, Joanne and Siobhán Garvin, respectively, called for help from four [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers sitting in a [[Land Rover]] about twenty feet away from the attack, but they did not intervene to stop the attack.&lt;ref name="amnesty-report-robert-hamill"/&gt; The assault lasted about ten minutes, leaving both men unconscious.&lt;ref name="cory-collusion-report-robert-hamill"/&gt; Just before the ambulance arrived, one of the RUC men got out of the Land Rover and told Garvin to put Robert into the [[recovery position]].

Robert Hamill never regained consciousness and died of his injuries eleven days later on 8 May 1997, aged 25.&lt;ref name="cory-collusion-report-robert-hamill"/&gt; The cause of his death was recorded as "Diffuse Brain Injury associated with Fracture of Skull due to Blows to the Head".&lt;ref name="cory-collusion-report-robert-hamill"/&gt; Six people were arrested after Robert Hamill's death, but only one was eventually tried for his murder.&lt;ref name="amnesty-report-robert-hamill"/&gt;

==Investigation==

===Trial of Paul Hobson===
Paul R. Hobson was charged with murder, but found not guilty, though he was found guilty of unlawful fighting and causing an affray and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. The case under which Hobson was prosecuted is questionable as the main witness, Constable Atkinson of the then RUC, was at one stage a suspect in conspiracy to cause murder in the same case. His solicitor also did not use crucial evidence in the case to cross-examine witnesses.&lt;ref name="amnesty-report-robert-hamill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rte-news-hobson-verdict"&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/0325/hamill.html Portadown man cleared of Robert Hamill's murder], RTÉ News, 25 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Justice McCollum said during his verdict that the killing was a sectarian act, with a very large number of loyalists attacking a small number of nationalists, but that he could not decide whether the RUC men had left their Land Rover or not during the attack.

===Allegations of police collusion===
The RUC have been criticised for initially claiming in press releases that there was a riot between two large groups; then afterwards claiming it was a large group attacking a group of four.&lt;ref name="cory-collusion-report-robert-hamill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amnesty-report-robert-hamill"/&gt; [[Rosemary Nelson]] was solicitor for the Hamill family until she was assassinated by a loyalist car bomb in [[Lurgan]].&lt;ref name="cory-collusion-report-robert-hamill"/&gt;

There have been allegations of [[collusion]] between the RUC and suspects.&lt;ref name="cory-collusion-report-robert-hamill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rte-public-enquiry-claims-against-ruc"&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0113/hamillr.html Claims against RUC at Hamill inquiry], RTÉ News, 13 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A public inquiry is currently being held on the recommendation of [[Cory Collusion Inquiry]].&lt;ref name="public-inquiry"&gt;[http://www.roberthamillinquiry.org/ Robert Hamill Inquiry]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New charges===
In December 2010 it was announced that three people, including a former RUC officer, were to be charged in relation to Robert Hamill's death.&lt;ref name="it-former-ruc-officer-to-be-charged"&gt;{{cite news|title=Former RUC officer to be charged in Hamill case|last=Moriarty|first=Gerry|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]

In September 2014 District Judge [[Peter King (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter King]], sitting at Craigavon court, ruled that a key witness was entirely unreliable and utterly unconvincing.  The case against the three, ex-policeman Robert Cecil Atkinson, his wife Eleanor Atkinson, and Kenneth Hanvey, was not sufficient to try.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-29045759|title=Robert Hamill murder: Three accused will not face trial|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5271">'''Dorris Henderson''' (February 2, 1933 – March 3, 2005) was an [[United States of America|American]]-born, [[United Kingdom]]-based [[folk music]] singer and [[autoharp]] player.

==Early years==
Born in [[Lakeland, Florida]] but raised in [[Los Angeles]], she was the daughter of an [[African Americans|African American]] clergyman and the granddaughter of a [[Blackfoot]] [[Aboriginal Americans in the United States|Native American]].&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dorris-henderson-527695.html |title=Dorris Henderson : Obituary |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date= |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blues musician, [[Guitar Nubbit]], was her uncle.&lt;ref name="John"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnrenbourn.co.uk/track-listings-and-notes/ |title=There You Go |publisher=John Renbourn |date= |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She initially worked as a [[civil servant]] but became interested in music after seeing a performance by [[Odetta]] at the famed LA folk venue the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]].&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt; She soon became a regular at [[Sunset Boulevard]]'s [[jazz]] clubs and soon began to perform autoharp version of tunes from [[Alan Lomax]]'s ''The Folk Songs of North America''.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt; Henderson got her break when she met [[Lord Buckley]] and joined him for a series of stage shows in [[Hollywood]], including an appearance singing '[[Rock of Ages (Christian hymn)|Rock of Ages]]' on one of Buckley's live albums.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;

==Full-time music career==
Having gained some recognition from her association with Buckley Henderson decided to devote her attentions to music full-time and moved to [[New York City]] in order to do so at a time when the city's [[Greenwich Village]] area was the centre of a boom in American folk music. Henderson quickly became a friend of leading scene figures such as [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[Fred Neil]], [[Paul Simon]], becoming one of the first artists to cover Simon with her version of 'Leaves That are Green', and [[Bob Dylan]], making a brief appearance in the latter's film ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;

==Move to the UK==
Henderson's brother served in [[England]] with the [[United States Air Force]] and, following encouragement from him, she travelled to [[London]], staying at a hotel in the [[Hampstead]] area.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt; Henderson soon became a regular feature at [[The Troubadour (London)|The Troubadour]], a centre of the [[folk revival]], and from there won a residency on the [[BBC2]] [[television]] programme ''Gadzooks! It's All Happening'', appearing alongside such stars of the time as [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] and [[Sandie Shaw]].&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt; After meeting [[John Renbourn]] at [[The Roundhouse]] she offered the young guitarist the chance to accompany her and the duo recorded two albums together - ''There You Go'' (1965) and ''Watch the Stars'' (1967).&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt; After an encounter with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] folk singer Cobi Schreijer at the same venue she also undertook a [[Europe]]an tour encompassing thirteen countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmpr.co.uk/msm27.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304002114/http://www.pmpr.co.uk/msm27.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-03-04|title=Dorris Henderson Obituary|accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Following Renbourn's departure to link up with [[Bert Jansch]] Henderson became the singer with the band [[Eclection]], performing with them at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969]], and, following their demise, launched Dorris Henderson's Eclection with her son Eric Jones as guitarist.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt; After marrying Mac McGann, formerly of the Levee Breakers, Henderson settled in [[Twickenham]] and largely retired from music, bar some [[jingle]] work and a few appearance with [[Bob Kerr (musician)|Bob Kerr]].&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;

Following a rerelease of ''There You Go'' in 1999 Henderson returned to music on a more regular basis, culminating in the 2003 album ''Here I Go Again'', a work featuring Renbourn and a number of other former colleagues and described by Henderson as 'my musical autobiography'.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt; Henderson died in 2005 after battling against [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.charliegillett.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=459 |title=The Sound of the World |website=Charliegillett.com |date=2005-03-04 |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His sister, Pam Schafer, was the first wife of former [[Democratic-NPL]] U.S. Senator [[Kent Conrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hagstrom |first=Jerry |url=http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/1007/103107cdpm2.htm |title=Bush nominates former North Dakota governor as Agriculture secretary - Oversight |website=GovExec.com |date=2007-10-31 |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gold Seal Company==
Schafer took a full-time job after graduation with his family's firm, the Gold Seal Company. Gold Seal was a [[North Dakota]]-based manufacturing company founded and owned by his father, Harold Schafer, in 1942.

Gold Seal was the distributor of "[[Mr. Bubble]]" bubble bath, "Glass Wax" glass cleaner and "Snowy Bleach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bismarckcafe.com/blogs/wiki/gold-seal-company |title=Gold Seal Company - BisManCafe.com |website=Bismarckcafe.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Schafer rose through the ranks at Gold Seal, working in several divisions of the company. Eventually, he served as company president from 1978 to 1985. At its height, Gold Seal generated more than $50 million in annual revenues, which made it one of North Dakota's largest privately held firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.nd.gov/archives/manuscripts/inventory/31888.html |title=31888 - State Historical Society - State Agencies - Archives Holdings - Archives - Governor |website=History.nd.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Junkyard Wars engineering game show TV competition==
Schafer has had a long-time interest in building machinery and equipment from used, scrap materials. Schafer was selected as a contestant on the [[Discovery Channel]]'s engineering game show ''[[Junkyard Wars]]'', when his team worked to build a machine from junked components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/junkyard-wars.htm |title=How 'Junkyard Wars' Works &amp;#124; HowStuffWorks |website=Entertainment.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Schafer was seen competing during the fifth season of the show, when he also served as the captain of the "High Flyers" team. His team took 2nd Place in the competition, losing to the "Jet Doctors" in the Season Five finale.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Governor of North Dakota==
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}
Schafer was elected twice and served as the 30th governor of North Dakota, holding office from 1992 to 2000.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; He is a Republican and a self-styled conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kfyrtv.com/content/news/Former-ND-Gov-Ed-Schafer-Endorses-Burgum-382139891.html |title=Former N.D. Gov. Ed Schafer Endorses Burgum |website=Kfyrtv.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Schafer unsuccessfully challenged then-U.S. Congressman [[Byron Dorgan]] as Dorgan ran for re-election. Schafer captured 35% of the vote, to 65% for the Dorgan, the Democratic candidate.
He entered the North Dakota gubernatorial general election campaign of 1992 as the Republican nominee. He and the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor [[Rosemarie Myrdal]] were victorious over the Democratic candidate for governor, former Attorney General of North Dakota, [[Nicholas Spaeth]] and the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, Julie Hill. Schafer and Myrdal captured nearly 58% of the vote, compared to 41% for Spaeth and Hill. Upon his inauguration, Schafer became the first North Dakota Governor to be married while in office.

When Schafer became chief executive, North Dakota was facing major budgetary and financial hurdles. This continued, on and off, throughout his two terms. "As governor, Schafer had to deal with budget crunches during his eight years as state budget maker in the Capitol," according to the ''[[Bismarck Tribune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bismarcktribune.com/news/opinion/editorial/columnists/disharmony-in-higher-education/article_f506496c-cbea-50a3-8a67-b956da1b67a5.html |title=Disharmony in higher education &amp;#124; Columnists |website=Bismarcktribune.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While governor, Schafer oversaw annual state budgets that exceeded $4.5 billion and a state employee workforce of more than 12,000.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Schafer made the expansion and diversification of North Dakota's economy a priority. For example, he worked with the private sector to expand the production and distribution of value-added agricultural products such as corn sweeteners and pasta.

During his time in office, he helped to build a closer trading relationship with China in concert with other North Dakota government officials, federal government trade specialists and private sector business leaders. These efforts assisted in the development of China into a primary export market for North Dakota's products and services in the 1990s.

As governor during the rise of the global [[internet]] and the internet's introduction to broader society, Schafer realized the need for internet access across North Dakota. Schafer worked with both government and business leaders, implementing various efforts "to upgrade North Dakota's communications infrastructure and make high-speed voice and data networks available to farmers, ranchers and rural businesses", and to individual households.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 1995, Schafer served as Chair of the [[Midwestern Governors Association]].

When Governor Schafer ran for reelection in 1996, he and Lt. Gov. Rosemarie Myrdal defeated [[Lee Kaldor]], the Democratic gubernatorial candidate and [[Barbara Pyle]], the Democratic candidate running for lieutenant governor. Schafer and Myrdal received about two-thirds of the total votes in the general election.

Schafer's long-held interest in conservation led him to help arrange the U.S. Forest Service's May 2007 purchase of the 5,200 acre [[Elkhorn Ranch]] in North Dakota, while Schafer was governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahomecontentidonly=true&amp;contentid=bios_schafer.xml |title=Secretary of Agriculture Ed Schafer &amp;#124; USDA |website=Usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elkhorn Ranch was established by former United States president Theodore Roosevelt as his main working ranch in the [[North Dakota Badlands]], and is now protected as a unit of the [[Theodore Roosevelt National Park]].

In 1999-2000, during the final portion of his second term, Schafer served as chair of the [[Republican Governors Association]].

He did not seek reelection for governor in 2000.

==Work life and political activities in the 2000s==
Schafer was co-founder and CEO of [[Extend America]], a start-up wireless communications company he founded after leaving office as governor.

In 2002, Schafer was appointed as civilian aide to the [[United States Secretary of the Army]].

Schafer acted as a frequent guest host of the "Hot Talk" radio program on [[WDAY-AM]] in [[Fargo, North Dakota]].

Prior to his appointment to the cabinet, Schafer also served as an advisor and occasional spokesperson for the North Dakota chapter of [[Americans for Prosperity]], a conservative advocacy group [[Political activities of the Koch brothers|backed by the Koch Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwartzel |first=Erich |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/group-backed-by-koch-brothers-takes-aim-at-tax-credits-for-films-1458934367 |title=Group Backed by Koch Brothers Takes Aim at Tax Credits for Films |publisher=WSJ |date=2016-03-25 |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Schafer became a supporter of the North Dakota Taxpayers' Association, serving as an advisor and a keynote speaker.

==U.S. Secretary of Agriculture==
In October 2007 Schafer was nominated by then-President [[George W. Bush]] to be the next Secretary of Agriculture.&lt;ref name="WH"&gt;{{cite press release|title=President Bush Nominates Ed Schafer for Secretary of Agriculture |publisher=White House|date=October 31, 2007|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/10/20071031-9.html|accessdate=January 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schafer had wide support in the Senate. His hearing was originally scheduled for January 30, 2008, but was moved up on the request of North Dakota Senator [[Kent Conrad]] so that Schafer could attend the [[State of the Union address]] as a cabinet member.&lt;ref&gt;Jalonick, Mary Clare. ''[http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2008/01/12/news/state/146407.txt Schafer hearing to be held] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120720170802/http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2008/01/12/news/state/146407.txt |date=2012-07-20 }}''.

"That's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."&lt;/ref&gt; That confirmation  hearing was held on January 24,&lt;ref&gt;Pates, Mikkel.

''[http://dakotafarmer.com/index.aspx?ascxid=fpStory&amp;fpsid=31906&amp;fpstid=2 Senate Ag Committee Quizzes Schafer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223124230/http://www.dakotafarmer.com/index.aspx?ascxid=fpStory |date=2008-02-23 }}''. Dakota Farmer. 2008-01-25. Accessed 2008-01-25."&lt;/ref&gt; On January 28, he was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Later that same day, as Secretary of Agriculture, Shafer did attend the State of the Union Address with other members of the President's cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/stateoftheunion/2008/index.html |title=State of the Union 2008 |website=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schafer was in office for less than two days when a major scandal erupted concerning animal cruelty and unsafe food practices by [[Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company]], the nation's second-largest supplier of ground beef to the National School Lunch Program. The school lunch program is administered by the Department of Agriculture.

This led to the largest recall of meat in the history of the United States. The issues of how best to handle the problems of unsafe food practices and animal cruelty by USDA-inspected meat processing plants became a major focus of Schafer's administration.

The [[Humane Society of the United States]] received video showing multiple instances of workers abusing and torturing cattle who had fallen and were unable to walk into kill pens on their own, videographed in October and November 2007.  The Humane Society, and many meat animal experts, ethicists and nutritionists objected to the use of [[downer (animal)|downer cattle]], or non-ambulatory cattle for human food, because of health, food safety - and because the cruelty showed ethical lapses on the part of Hallmark's management in over-seeing the behavior of their employees.

The company recalled massive quantities of beef and voluntarily shut down the plant where these videos were taken.  According to the Cattlemen's Beef Promotions Board "The 143 million pound recall of beef from Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company triggered significant (media) coverage and renewed skepticism about the safety of the nation's beef supply and the competency of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160917135223/http://www.beefusa.org/uDocs/janfebmediaanalysis499.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

At issue for USDA, under Schafer, and the Senate was whether these sick, injured and/or aged non-ambulatory cattle were safe for humans to eat.

In his February 28, 2008 testimony before the [[U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies]], Secretary Schafer indicated "that he would not endorse an outright ban on "downer" cows entering the food supply or back stiffer penalties for regulatory violations by meat-processing plants in the wake of the largest beef recall in the nation's history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/28/AR2008022804117.html |title=USDA Rejects 'Downer' Cow Ban |website=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, "the penalties are strong and swift, as we have shown," Schafer said. "Financially, I don't see how this company can survive. People need to be responsible and, from USDA's standpoint, they will be held responsible. . . . They broke the rules. That does not mean the rules are wrong. I believe the rules are adequate."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161003120406/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110shrg44333/pdf/CHRG-110shrg44333.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Secretary Schafer's leadership, the Agriculture Department promised to improve animal welfare and human food safety.  On August 27, 2008, USDA announced a proposed change in the rule regarding the treatment and handling of downer cattle. In a reversal of his February testimony to the Senate, Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer indicated that "to maintain consumer confidence in the food supply, eliminate further misunderstanding of the rule and, ultimately, to make a positive impact on the humane handling of cattle, I believe it is sound policy to simplify this matter by initiating a complete ban on the slaughter of downer cattle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentidonly=true&amp;contentid=2008/08/0218.xml |title=USDA Announces Proposed Rule for Requirements of the Disposition of Downer Cattle &amp;#124; USDA Newsroom |website=Usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120001707/https://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentidonly=true&amp;contentid=2008%2F08%2F0218.xml |archive-date=2017-01-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Secretary Schafer predicted in his February 2008 Senate testimony, Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company subsequently went out of business.

Based in part on the initial work done by USDA personnel during Schafer's tenure as Agriculture Secretary, the U.S. Government sued Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company based on farm animal cruelty (to downer cattle), misrepresentation and fraud, winning a massive final judgement of $497 million. 
 
This was the largest judgment ever entered for agriculture-related fraud and farm animal cruelty in federal court history. In this first-of-its-kind fraud case, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) at the behest of USDA joined a lawsuit with the Humane Society of the U.S. against Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company. The lawsuit alleged that the Hallmark/Westland defrauded the federal government by violating and misrepresenting their compliance with the terms of their federal school lunch program contracts requiring the humane handling of animals.

A final judgement was entered in the case against defendant Hallmark Meat Packing Company in the amount of $497,000,000.00 in 2012 in favor of the DOJ. Yet that the majority of the $497 million was never recovered by the DOJ because of the company's bankruptcy and cessation of all business. The amount was reduced to $155 million as part of the final settlement with the remaining defendants. Part of the judgement amount was paid personally by company executives and members of the Hallmark family in [[structured settlements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law360.com/articles/394827/slaughterhouse-owners-hit-with-500m-judgment-in-fca-case |title=Slaughterhouse Owners Hit With $500M Judgment In FCA Case |publisher=Law360 |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animallaw.info/article/detailed-discussion-ag-gag-laws |title=Detailed Discussion of Ag-gag Laws &amp;#124; Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center |website=Animallaw.info |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These huge judgements and settlements in favor of the federal government were intended by the Department of Justice and the Department of Agriculture to deter future animal cruelty in and fraud by the nation's slaughterhouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2012/11/hallmark-meat-company-settlement-111612.html?credit=aa_a6749?referrer=https://www.google.com/ |title=Owners of Infamous Hallmark Meat Company Pay $300,000 in HSUS Slaughterhouse Cruelty Case : The Humane Society of the United States |website=Humanesociety.org |date=2015-11-13 |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schafer left the Secretary of Agriculture position at the end of the Bush administration in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zeleny |first1=Jeff |last2=Herszenhorn |first2=David M. |date=December 16, 2008 |title=Iowa Ex-Governor Picked for Agriculture Secretary |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/us/politics/17appoint.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=CNN Library |date=December 7, 2017 |title=Tom Vilsack Fast Facts |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/07/us/tom-vilsack-fast-facts/index.html |work=CNN.com |location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interim president of the University of North Dakota ==
Schafer was appointed as the interim president of the [[University of North Dakota]] on November 9, 2016, by the Board of Higher Education. Among several dozen applicants for the interim office received by the state, Schafer stated he had no intention to apply to become the next permanent president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Former Gov. Ed Schafer takes over as interim UND president {{!}} KSL.com|url = https://www.ksl.com/?nid=157&amp;sid=38140207&amp;title=former-gov-ed-schafer-takes-over-as-interim-und-president|website = www.ksl.com|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shafer signed a contract on December 2, 2015, to fill in for former University of North Dakota president [[Robert Kelley]] upon Kelley's retirement, which took place on January 14, 2016. This interim position Schafer accepted with "some hesitancy", he said.

Schafer's appointment as interim president of the University of North Dakota "did not sit well with a significant portion of the university faculty, according to the faculty representative on the Board of Higher Education." This lack of support by that portion of the university faculty was due in large part to the facts that Schafer did not possess an earned doctorate nor did he have any administrative experience in a research university, according to Eric Murphy, the advisor to the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education. "The faculty voice is in opposition to" Schafer's selection as interim president, Murphy said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/ed-schafer-named-interim-und-president/article_9f2d2063-3bb4-5207-a7a4-364937595715.html |title=Ed Schafer named interim UND president &amp;#124; Government and Politics |website=bismarcktribune.com |date=2017-01-04 |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schafer's working life was spent primarily in the realms of business and politics.

Despite his lack of academic leadership experience, Schafer became the highest-paid administrator in the state's entire higher education system history to that time. Schafer was paid $33,216 per month for his work that commenced on January 15, 2016, and continued through June 30, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Ed Schafer starts as UND president Friday|url = http://www.valleynewslive.com/news/local/headlines/Ed-Schafer-starts-as-UND-president-Friday-365394301.html|website = www.valleynewslive.com|access-date = 2016-01-16|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160130123939/http://www.valleynewslive.com/news/local/headlines/Ed-Schafer-starts-as-UND-president-Friday-365394301.html|archivedate = 2016-01-30|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = Unpacking a new president: Schafer takes over UND|url = http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/education/3925904-unpacking-new-president-schafer-takes-over-und|website = Grand Forks Herald|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schafer's contract paid him $2,250 per month more than the retiring president, Robert Kelley, was earning after more than seven years in that position.

Among the tasks Schafer inherited was overseeing the final stages of the [[North Dakota Fighting Sioux controversy|Fighting Sioux naming issue]] that erupted over objections by various tribes, ethnic groups, and First Nation peoples identifying as [[Sioux]], many other groups and thought leaders because of the University's use of the [[Sioux]] name and identity for its sports teams. On Schafer's first day as interim president, the University's Graphic Identity RFP Evaluation and Recommendation Team met to begin reviewing the 16 proposals from design firms for a new logo design for the [[North Dakota Fighting Hawks|Fighting Hawks]]. Five months later, near the end of his interim term, Schafer revealed the new logo at a news conference on June 22, 2016, referring to the logo's debut as a "historic moment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rupard |first=Wade |url=http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/local/4059989-determined-hawk-adopted-new-und-fighting-hawks-logo |title='Determined hawk' adopted as new UND Fighting Hawks logo |newspaper=[[Grand Forks Herald]] |date=2016-06-22 |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2016, the selection of [[Mark Kennedy (politician)|Mark Kennedy]] as the 12th president of the University of North Dakota was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://und.edu/news/2016/03/presidential-announcement-mark-kennedy.cfm|title=State Board of Higher Education appoints Mark Kennedy UND president {{!}} 03 {{!}} 2016 {{!}} News {{!}} UND: University of North Dakota|last=Dakota|first=- The University of North|website=und.edu|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy's term began on July 1, 2016, succeeding Schafer.

'''Fat Bastard''' is a fictional character in the second and third films of the [[Austin Powers (film series)|''Austin Powers'' series]]. A morbidly [[Obesity|obese]] henchman hailing from [[Scotland]], Fat Bastard serves [[Dr. Evil]] in his quest to destroy [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]]. The character is portrayed by [[Mike Myers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levy |first=Glen |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/08/22/top-10-worst-fake-british-accents/slide/mike-myers-as-fat-bastard-austin-powers-the-spy-who-shagged-me-1999/ |title=Mike Myers (as Fat Bastard), 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me' (1999) &amp;#124; Top 10 Worst Fake British Accents &amp;#124; TIME.com |publisher=Entertainment.time.com |date=2011-08-19 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/44147655/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/austin-powers-needs-kill-fat-bastard/#.U36XAdJdVsw |title='Austin Powers' needs to kill off Fat Bastard - today &gt; entertainment - today &gt; entertainment &gt; movies |publisher=TODAY.com |date=2011-08-15 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/movies/kick-to-the-nuts-austin-powers-the-spy-who-shagged-me|title=Kick to the Nuts - Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me|publisher=ugo.com|accessdate=May 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523070555/http://www.ugo.com/movies/kick-to-the-nuts-austin-powers-the-spy-who-shagged-me |archivedate=May 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His extreme size and weight (1 metric [[tonne]], according to Dr. Evil) endows Fat Bastard with massive strength. He exhibited this prowess in the sumo ring in the third movie.

Fat Bastard is noted for his foul temper, his emotional monologues that culminate in [[flatulence]], his vulgar manners, and his unusual diet. These go as far as to include a [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] taste for human infants and [[Dwarfism|midgets]], whom he gluttonously calls, "The ''other'', [[Pork. The Other White Meat|other white meat]]". In ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'', he boasts that he once ate a baby, and tries to refuse Dr. Evil's money for his services in exchange for getting to eat [[Mini-Me]]. He also has the same Scottish accent as [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] (also voiced by Myers), whose movie was released two years later in 2001.

==Appearances==
===''Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me''===
Fat Bastard had stolen Austin's [[Mojo (African-American culture)|mojo]] in 1969, as he is a guard in the facility, and has knocked out the other guards using bagpipes that spray gas, leaving Austin [[Erectile dysfunction|impotent]] in 1999. After seducing and sleeping with Fat Bastard, secret agent—and Austin's ally—[[Felicity Shagwell]] ([[Heather Graham (actress)|Heather Graham]]) places a homing device in his [[rectum]]. During this time with Felicity, Fat Bastard is also eating a whole chicken while in bed with her. However, the device is ineffective, lost and left in a toilet before he returns to Dr. Evil's island. However, traces of rare vegetables are found in a stool sample, enabling the island to be tracked down. Fat Bastard often declares himself "dead sexy", but he is really hiding his true feelings of rejection from society. During an assassination attempt against Austin and Felicity in 1999, Fat Bastard dresses as a package delivery man and literally breaks in through the front door. When Felicity asks if he is happy, Fat Bastard has an emotional breakdown, tearfully confessing "I eat because I'm unhappy, and I'm unhappy because I eat. It's a vicious cycle. Now if you'll excuse me, there's someone I need to get in touch with and forgive. Myself." after which he then farts. Austin and Felicity are both disgusted. Fat Bastard is visibly embarrassed and says, "Sorry, I farted. It's a long road ahead.". He changes his mind and attempts to kill Austin and Felicity. Felicity then incapacitates him with a kick to his [[groin]]. He places his hands on his thighs and moans "Right in the mommy daddy button" ([[scrotum]]). Fat Bastard then screams and falls, shaking the room.

===''Austin Powers in Goldmember''===
In the next film, Fat Bastard retires from being a henchman and relocates to [[Japan]]. There, he becomes a [[sumo]] wrestler and, despite trying to go straight, he still carries out the odd job for Dr. Evil. During his bathroom time Foxxy Cleopatra and Austin sneak in using a disguise and catch him. Austin starts shouting to him "You really are a Fat Bastard"; "You know that hurts my feelings; I've tried going on a diet, you know", he replies. Fat Bastard then says he did the [[Zone diet]], stating that "carbs are the enemy," though the Zone Diet promotes equal amounts of carbs and protein and Fat Bastard probably meant the [[Atkins diet]], which emphasizes low carbs. After tearfully telling Austin and Foxxy that he's happy as a sumo wrestler he farts. Austin then asks if he soiled himself. Fat Bastard replies, "Maybe." and laughs.

By the end of ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', he has lost his excessive weight, crediting it to the [[Jared Fogle|Subway diet]], even citing [[Jared Fogle]] as a hero (it is unknown what Fat Bastard thinks of Jared's [[Child pornography|current criminal convictions]]). However, he points out that he still has a lot of excess skin, further noting the resemblance of his neck to a [[vagina]]. On the film [[audio commentary]], Mike Myers says that Fat Bastard probably will not stay thin (as "Thin Bastard", as he called him) and would most likely return to his overweight state.

===Popular culture and DirecTV commercial===
* Beginning in June 2006, this character was in a [[DirecTV]] commercial with [[Mini-Me]]. The plot was that he was talking about how Mini-Me was looking good to eat, like in the movies (see above). Mini-Me thinks that he is crazy. He also uses two of his lines from the movie. His famous line in this commercial is "Come on, get in my belly!"
* On an episode of [[Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue]] titled "In the Freeze Zone", the monster Freezard references Fat Bastard by saying "Get in my Belly!". One of the show's stars, [[Michael Chaturantabut]], would make a cameo appearance in [[Austin Powers in Goldmember]], as a gunman at the pool area.
* On an episode of [[WWE SmackDown|WWF SmackDown!]] (aired Thursday, April 13, 2000), Professional wrestler, [[Big Show (wrestler)|The Big Show]] dresses as Fat Bastard and reveals what's under the kilt, much to [[Kurt Angle]]'s disgusted chagrin. Commentator [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] suggested it was a thong.

==Censorship==
In reviews for the movie in the newspapers, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] referred to him as ''"We can't even say his name!"'', while others called him ''"Obese Illegitimate Child"''.

The mass retail [[action figure]]s sold of the character had the name "Fat Man" on the box, even though the patch on his blazer clearly displayed "FB". Specialty stores such as [[comic book]] shops had figures in packaging which referred to him as "Fat Bastard", however.

'''Faustin-Élie Soulouque''' (15 August 1782 – 6 August 1867)&lt;ref&gt;[http://primature.gouv.ht/ Official website of the Presidency of Haiti (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; was a Haitian military commander who served as a general in the [[Haitian Army]] when he was elected [[President of Haiti]] in 1847. In 1849 he was proclaimed Emperor of Haiti under the name ''Faustin I''. He soon purged the army of the ruling elite, installed black loyalists in administrative positions, and created a [[secret police]] and a personal army. In 1849 he created a black nobility in the country. An enthusiastic ''vodouisant'', Soulouque kept among his Place staff several bocors and mambos, and [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]] was openly practiced in the capital during his reign, marking perhaps the first time in Haiti's history when a governing ruler gave the much-maligned religion semi-official status.  

The spirits however were not enough to ward off a series of Dominican navy reprisal raids along Haiti's south coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deibert|first1=Michael|title=Notes From the Last Testament: The Struggle for Haiti|date=2011|publisher=Seven Stories Press|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; His unsuccessful attempts to conquer the neighbouring [[Dominican Republic]] undermined his control and  a conspiracy led by [[Fabre Geffrard|General Fabre Nicolas Geffrard]] forced him to [[abdication|abdicate]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Jan

==Early years==

Born into slavery in [[Petit-Goâve]] in 1782, Soulouque was one of two sons of Marie-Catherine Soulouque. The latter was born at Port-au-Prince, Saint-Domingue, 1744, as a creole slave descended from the [[Mandinka people]]. She died at Port-au-Prince, 9 August 1819. He was freed as a result of a 1793 decree of [[Léger-Félicité Sonthonax]], the Civil Commissioner of the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]], that abolished slavery in response to slave revolts in 1791. 

As a free citizen, and with his freedom in serious jeopardy due to attempts of the French government to re-establish slavery in its colony of Saint-Domingue, he enlisted in the black revolutionary army to fight as a private during the [[Haitian Revolution]] between 1803 and 1804. During this conflict, Soulouque became a respected soldier and as a consequence he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Army of [[Haiti]] in 1806 and made [[aide-de-camp]] to General Lamarre.

In 1810 he was appointed to the Horse Guards under President [[Alexandre Pétion|Pétion]]. During the next four decades he continued to serve in the Haitian Military, rising to the rank of Colonel under President [[Philippe Guerrier|Guerrier]], until finally promoted to the highest command in the Haitian Army, attaining the rank of Lieutenant General and Supreme Commander of the Presidential Guards under then President [[Jean-Baptiste Riché]].

==Reign==

In 1847 President Riché died. During his tenure he had acted as a figurehead for the [[Jean-Pierre Boyer|Boyerist]] ruling class, who immediately began to look for a replacement. Their attention quickly focused on Faustin Soulouque, whom the majority considered to be a somewhat dull and ignorant man. At the age of 65 he seemed to be a malleable candidate and was subsequently enticed to accept the role offered him, taking the Presidential Oath of Office on 2 March 1847.

At first Faustin seemed to fill the role of puppet well. He retained the cabinet-level ministers of the former president and continued the programs of his predecessor. Within a short time however, he overthrew his backers and made himself absolute ruler of the Haitian state. According to the book ''A Continent Of Islands: Searching For The Caribbean Destiny'' by Mark Kurlansky: “He organized a private militia, the Zinglins, and proceeded to arrest, kill, and burn out anyone who opposed him, especially mulattoes, thus consolidating his power over the government. This process included a massacre of the mulattoes in Port-au-Prince on 16 April 1848,&lt;ref name="ea"&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Faustin I}}&lt;/ref&gt; and culminated in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies proclaiming him Emperor of Haiti on 26 August 1849.

Soulouque also invited blacks from [[Louisiana]] to immigrate to Haiti. Haitian-educated Emile Desdunes, an [[Louisiana Creole people|Afro-Creole]] native from [[New Orleans]], acted as an agent for Soulouque and arranged free transportation to Haiti in 1859 for at least 350 desperate evacuees. A large number of these refugees later returned to Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yqVy_VjLVOoC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Soulouque+also+invited+black+Louisianans+to+immigrate+to+Haiti.&amp;hl=en |title=Revolution, Romanticism, and the Afro-Creole Protest Tradition in Louisiana 1718–1868 |page=86 |editor=Bell, Caryn Cossé |year=1997 |isbn=0-8071-3026-5 |accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soulouque's reign was marked by a violent restrictions towards opposition and numerous murders. The fact that Soulouque was an open adherent of the African Vodou religion, contributed to his violent reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-trial-that-gave-vodou-a-bad-name-83801276/#lt8OVolc7bR3OhT4.99 Website] of the ''Smithsonian'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coronation==
[[File:Sacre de l'empereur Faustin Soulouque.jpg|thumb|250 px|The coronation of Faustin I]]
Soulouque paid £2,000 for his crown, and spent £30,000 for the rest of the accessories (according to Sir Spenser St John, British charge d’affaires in Haiti during the 1860s in his account: "Hayti, or, The Black Republic", pp.&amp;nbsp;95–96). 

Gustave d’Alaux describes this event in his book, Soulouque and his Empire: “His Imperial Majesty had the principal merchant of Port-au-Prince called one morning and commanded him to order immediately from Paris a costume, in every particular like that he admired in representing the ceremonies of Napoleon’s coronation. Faustin I besides ordered for himself a crown, one for the Empress, a sceptre, globe, hand-of-justice, throne, and all other accessories, all to be like those used in the coronation of Napoleon.". 

In December 1849 Faustin married his long-time companion [[Adélina Lévêque]]. On 18 April 1852 at the capital [[Port-au-Prince]], both emperor and empress were crowned in an immense and lavish ceremony in emulation of the coronation of the French Emperor [[Napoleon I]]. 

The president of the Senate attached to the breast of the Emperor a large decoration, passed a chain about the neck of the Empress – and pronounced his address, to which His Majesty Faustin replied with spirit: “Vive la liberté, vive l'égalité!” (Gustave d’Alaux). The coronation is illustrated in the 'Album Impériale d'Haïti', engraved by Severyn, published New York, 1852 (available in the British Library).

==Nobility==
[[File:Faustin I.jpg|thumb|Faustin I, from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 16 February 1856]]
During his subsequent reign, Faustin attempted to create a strong centralized government, which while retaining a profoundly Haitian character, borrowed heavily from European traditions, especially those of the [[First French Empire]]. One of his first acts after being declared emperor was to establish a Haitian nobility. The Constitution of 20 September 1849 granted the Emperor the right to create hereditary titles and confer other honours on his subjects. 

Volumes 5 and 6 of John Saunders and Westland Marston’s The National magazine (published in 1859) stated the empire consisted of 4 princes, 59 dukes, 90 earls, 30 lady knights (but no male knights), 250 barons, and 2 marchionesses. The first patents were issued by Emperor Faustin on 21 December 1850. Other sources add "trent cent Chevaliers" and "quatre cents nobles" to this list.&lt;ref name="Website of Christopher Buyers"&gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Haiti/haiti5.htm Website of Christopher Buyers]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Subsequent creations extended the number of noble titles. Titles issued by king Henry Christophe were sometimes reissued by Faustin. As an example the title of Comte du Terrier-Rouge was issued to Charles Pierre under Christophe (The Armorial of Haiti, College of Arms, London 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;78) and the same title was issued under Soulouque on behalf of general Guerrier de Prophete (Java-Bode 5 August 1857). 

In order that he might reward loyalty to his regime as well as add to the prestige of the Haitian Monarchy, he established the Military Order of St. Faustin and the Civil Order of the Haitian Legion of Honor on 21 September 1849. Later, he created the Orders of St. Mary Magdalene and the Order of St. Anne in 1856. That same year he founded the Imperial Academy of Arts.

==Politics==
Faustin's foreign policy was centered on preventing foreign intrusion into Haitian politics and sovereignty. The independence of the [[Dominican Republic]] (then called Santo Domingo) during the [[Dominican War of Independence]] from Haiti was, in his view, a direct threat to that security. The white and mulatto rulers of the Dominican Republic he considered as his “natural” enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baur|first1=John E.|title=Faustin Soulouque, Emperor of Haiti His Character and His Reign|date=1949|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1849, Soulouque launched his first invasion of the Dominican Republic, but his army fled after 400 Dominicans put up resistance at Ocoa. A second invasion followed in 1850 which was checked by diplomatic opposition from Britain, France, and the United States. In the third and final invasion in 1855, Soulouque marched into the Dominican Republic at the head of a 30,000 man army which fled at the first shot.

During his reign, Faustin also found himself in direct confrontation with the United States over [[Navassa]] Island, which the United States had seized on the somewhat dubious grounds that [[guano]] had been discovered there. Faustin dispatched warships to the island in response to the incursion, but withdrew them after the United States guaranteed Haiti a portion of the revenues from the mining operations.

The question of who Soulouque really was is heavily disputed. Virtually no official government records of cabinet meetings exists. According to Latin American scholar Murdo J. MacLeod ("The Soulouque Regime In Haiti -- 1847 - 1859: A Reevaluation.", Caribbean Studies/Vol. 10. No. 3): "We are left with his policies as they are discernible, with an assessment of the men whom he used to govern, and with our evaluation of how correct his appreciation of the situation really was. In every case we must conclude that Faustin Soulouque was a man of high intelligence, a realist, a pragmatist, and a superb, if ruthless politician and diplomat. There is no denying his patriotism and his ability to impose domestic tranquility.".

* Jean-Baptiste Francisque (minister of justice, worship and public education)
* [[Lysius Salomon]] (Finance, Commerce and Foreign Relations)

==Line of succession==
Faustin's marriage to Empress [[Adélina, Empress of Haiti|Adélina]] produced one daughter, Princess Célita Soulouque. The emperor also adopted Adélina's daughter, Olive, in 1850. She was granted the title of Princess with the style Her Serene Highness. Célita married Jean Philippe Lubin, Count of Pétion-Ville,&lt;ref&gt;Roman Catholic Church Kingston (Jamaica) Marriages 1839-1869: Act of marriage: Pierre Joseph Amitie Vil Lubin, native of Haiti, lawful son of His Lordship Earl Philippe Vil Lubin and by his wife, Elizabeth Ulcénie. Lord Amitie Vil Lubin, married on 12/26/1861 HSH Princess Genevieve Olive Soulouque, native of Haiti, lawful daughter of Emperor Faustin Elie Soulouque and Empress Adélina Lévêque. Witnesses: Alexandre Bravo, Charles Grant, widow Lubin, Amitie Lubin, widow of Louis Lubin, Elizabeth Grant, James Male, Jean Baptiste Vil Lubin, George Clermont, A.M. Lhoste, Felicite Faustin, Ameisima Amitie, Elina Mainvaille, L. Bedonet, Elizabeth Bourke, Caroline Crosswell.&lt;/ref&gt; and had issue. The emperor had one brother, Prince Jean-Joseph Soulouque, who in turn had eleven sons and daughters. 

The Constitution of 20 September 1849 made the Imperial Dignity hereditary amongst the natural and legitimate direct descendants of Emperor Faustin I, by order of primogeniture and to the perpetual exclusion of females. The Emperor could adopt the children or grandchildren of his brothers, and become members of his family from the date of adoption. Sons so adopted enjoyed the right of succession to the throne, immediately after the Emperor's natural and legitimate sons.&lt;ref name="Website of Christopher Buyers" /&gt;

==Exile and death==

In 1858 a revolution began, led by General [[Fabre Geffrard]], Duc de Tabara. In December of that year, Geffrard defeated the Imperial Army and seized control of most of the country. On the night of December 20, 1858, he left Port-au-Prince in a small boat, accompanied only by his son and two trusty followers, Ernest Roumain and Jean-Bart. On 22 December he arrived at Gonaives, where the insurrection broke out. The Republic was acclaimed and the Constitution of 1846 was adopted. 

On 23 December, the Departmental Committee, which had been organized, divested Faustin Soulouque of his office and appointed Fabre Geffrard President of Haiti. Cap-Haitien and the whole Department of Artibonite joined in the restoration of the Republic. As a result, the emperor abdicated his throne on 15 January 1859. Refused aid by the French Legation, Faustin was taken into exile aboard a British warship on 22 January 1859. 

Soon afterwards, the emperor and his family arrived in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], where they remained for several years. Some records claim that he died in Kingston. But, according to Haitian historian Jacques Nicolas Léger in his book ''Haiti, her History and her Detractors'', Emperor Faustin actually died in [[Petit-Goave]] in August 1867, having had returned to Haiti at some point.

{{George H. W. Bush series}}
'''George Herbert Walker Bush''' (June 12, 1924&amp;nbsp;– November 30, 2018) was an [[American politician]] who served as the 41st [[President of the United States]] from 1989 to 1993. Prior to assuming the presidency, Bush served as the 43rd [[Vice President of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989. As a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he had previously been a [[U.S. Representative]], Ambassador, and [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. During his career in [[public service]], he was known simply as George Bush; after his eldest son [[George W. Bush]] became President of the United States in 2001, he was referred to as "George H. W. Bush", "Bush 41", or "George Bush Sr".

A scion of the [[Bush family]], he was born in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], to [[Prescott Bush]] and Dorothy Walker Bush. Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, Bush postponed his university studies, enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] on his 18th birthday, and became one of the youngest [[Naval aviation|aviator]]s in the U.S. Navy. He served until September 1945, and then attended [[Yale University]]. Graduating in 1948, he moved his family to [[West Texas]], where he entered the [[oil business]] and became a millionaire by the age of 40 in 1964.

Soon after founding his own oil company, Bush became involved in politics. He was defeated in his first election, for the U.S. Senate [[United States Senate election in Texas, 1964|in 1964]], but won election to the House of Representatives from [[Texas's 7th congressional district|Texas's 7th district]] [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1966#Texas|in 1966]]. He was re-elected in 1968 but was defeated for election to the Senate again [[United States Senate election in Texas, 1970|in 1970]]. In 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Bush as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]], and in 1973, Bush became the [[Chairman of the Republican National Committee]]. The following year, President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Bush as [[List of ambassadors of the United States to China#List of Chiefs of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing|Chief of the Liaison Office]] in [[China]] and later made Bush the [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. Bush ran for president in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]] and was defeated in the [[1980 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican primary]] by [[Ronald Reagan]], who chose him as his running mate in his successful bid for presidency. During his eight-year tenure as Vice President, Bush headed task forces on deregulation and the [[war on drugs]].

Bush ran [[George H. W. Bush presidential campaign, 1988|a successful campaign]] in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent [[Michael Dukakis]], becoming the first [[incumbent]] vice president in 152 years to be elected president. [[Foreign policy]] drove the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush presidency]]: [[Military operation]]s were conducted in [[United States invasion of Panama|Panama]] and [[Gulf War|the Persian Gulf]]; the [[Berlin Wall]] fell in 1989, and the [[Soviet Union]] dissolved two years later. Bush also signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which created a [[trade bloc]] consisting of the United States, [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]]. Domestically, Bush [[Read my lips: no new taxes|reneged on a 1988 campaign promise]] and signed a bill to increase taxes. In the wake of a weak recovery from an [[Early 1990s recession|economic recession]] and the diminution of foreign policy as a major issue in a post-[[Cold War]] [[political climate]], he lost the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]] to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]].

After leaving office in 1993, Bush was active—often alongside his former opponent [[Bill Clinton]]—in humanitarian activities. With George W. Bush's victory in the 2000 presidential election, Bush and his son became the second father–son pair to serve as president, following [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]]. Bush's second son, [[Jeb Bush]], served as the [[List of Governors of Florida|43rd]] Governor of Florida and sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.

Bush [[Death and state funeral of George H. W. Bush|died]] on November 30, 2018, at the age of {{Age in years and days nts|1924|06|12|2018|11|30}}. He has the distinction of being the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|longest-lived president]] in American history. &lt;!-- If Jimmy Carter is still alive on March 21, 2019, change the final sentence to: At the time of his death he was the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|longest-lived president]] in American history, a record surpassed by Jimmy Carter on March 21, 2019. --&gt;

George Herbert Walker Bush was born at 173 Adams Street in [[Milton, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidentialavenue.com/gb.cfm |title=Presidential Avenue: George Bush |access-date=March 29, 2008 |publisher=Presidential Avenue|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008144507/http://www.presidentialavenue.com/gb.cfm|archive-date=October 8, 2007|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; on June 12, 1924, to [[Prescott Bush|Prescott Sheldon Bush]] and Dorothy (Walker) Bush. The Bush family moved from Milton to [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], shortly after his birth. Bush was named after his maternal grandfather, George Herbert Walker, who was known as "Pop". In turn, Bush was called "Poppy" as a tribute to his namesake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eun Kyung Kim |url=http://www.today.com/parents/jenna-bush-hager-welcomes-second-daughter-named-after-george-h-t31121 |title=Jenna Bush Hager welcomes second daughter&amp;nbsp;— named after George H.W.

Bush, whose nickname growing up was "Poppy."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush began his formal education at the [[Greenwich Country Day School]] in Greenwich. Beginning in 1938, he attended [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], where he held a number of leadership positions that included president of the senior class, secretary of the student council, president of the community fund-raising group, a member of the editorial board of the school newspaper, and captain of both the varsity baseball and soccer teams.&lt;ref name="andover"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andover.edu/news/bush.htm |title=Former President George Bush honored at his 60th reunion at Phillips Academy, Andover |date=June 8, 2002 |access-date=March 29, 2008 |publisher=Phillips Academy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401131455/http://www.andover.edu/news/bush.htm |archivedate=April 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States formally entered World War II in December 1941, following [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in Hawaii. Six months later, Bush enlisted into the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]&lt;ref name="navy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/histories/biographies-list/bios-b/bush-george-h-w.html |title=George Herbert Walker Bush |date=December 1, 2018 |access-date=December 2, 2018 |publisher=Navy History and Heritage Command}}&lt;/ref&gt; immediately after he graduated from [[Phillips Academy]] on his eighteenth birthday.

In September 1943, he was assigned to Torpedo Squadron 51 (VT-51) as the photographic officer.&lt;ref name="navy" /&gt; The following year, his squadron was based in {{USS|San Jacinto|CVL-30|6}} as a member of Air Group 51, where his lanky physique earned him the nickname "Skin".&lt;ref name="Skin"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2009/01/san-jacinto-veterans-reunite-recall-serving-bush |title=San Jacinto veterans reunite, recall the one they called 'Skin' |last=Adams |first=Kathy |date=January 10, 2009 |work=The Virginian-Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |access-date=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the task force was victorious in one of the largest air battles of World War II: the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].&lt;ref name="navy" /&gt;

[[File:George H.W. Bush seated in a Grumman TBM Avenger, circa 1944 (H069-13).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bush in his Grumman TBM Avenger aboard USS ''San Jacinto'' in 1944]]

After Bush's promotion to [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] on August 1, 1944, ''San Jacinto'' commenced operations against the Japanese in the [[Bonin Islands]]. Bush piloted one of four [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Grumman TBM Avenger]]s of VT-51 that attacked the Japanese installations on [[Chichijima]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0312/20/cp.00.html Story of George H.

Several of those shot down during the attack were executed, and their livers were [[Chichijima incident|eaten]] by their captors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=James | authorlink = James Bradley (author)|title=Flyboys: A True Story of Courage |date=2003 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |isbn=978-0-316-10584-2|title-link=Flyboys: A True Story of Courage }}&lt;/ref&gt; This experience shaped Bush profoundly, leading him to ask, "Why had I been spared and what did God have for me?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/the-faith-of-george-h-w-bush-189108/ |title=The Faith of George HW Bush}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1944, Bush returned to ''San Jacinto'' and participated in operations in the Philippines until his squadron was replaced and sent home to the United States. Through 1944, he flew 58 combat missions&lt;ref name="maam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maam.org/flightsim/news/tbm_history.htm |title=History's Youngest Naval Aviator: George H. W.

His final assignment was to a new torpedo squadron, VT-153, based at [[Naval Air Station Grosse Ile]], Michigan. Bush was [[Military discharge|honorably discharged]] from the U.S. Navy in September 1945, one month after the [[Victory over Japan Day|surrender of Japan]].&lt;ref name=GHWBlifebefore&gt;{{cite web |title=George H.

==Marriage and college years==
When Bush was still in the Navy, he married [[Barbara Bush|Barbara Pierce]] (1925–2018) in [[Rye, New York]] on January 6, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Markovich |first=Jeremy |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/george-hw-bush-and-barbara-pierce-are-wed-jan-6-1945-233101 |title=George H.W.

After Bush received his military discharge, he enrolled at [[Yale University]]. He earned an undergraduate degree in economics on an accelerated program that enabled him to graduate in two and a half years, rather than the usual four.&lt;ref name=GHWBlifebefore /&gt; He was a member of the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity and was elected its president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/books/41-george-w-bushs-portrait-of-george-h-w-bush.html |title=Love Flows, President to President |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 11, 2014 |first=Michiko |last=Kakutani |access-date=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also captained the Yale baseball team and played in the first two [[College World Series]] as a left-handed [[first baseman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=School House to White House: The Education of the Presidents |url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2007/spring/schoolhouse.html |date=Spring 2007 |publisher=National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=March 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush was the team captain during his senior year in 1948, and he met [[Babe Ruth]] before a game; the event took place only weeks before Ruth's death.

He was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] when he graduated from Yale in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/kbank/profiles/bush/ |title=George Herbert Walker Bush |publisher=CNN |access-date=March 29, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308132103/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/kbank/profiles/bush/ |archivedate=March 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
After graduating from Yale, Bush moved his young family to [[West Texas]].

==Early political career (1963–1980)==
===Congressional years (1967–1971)===
[[File:George H. W. Bush 91st Congress.jpg|thumb|Bush in 1969]]

Bush's career in politics began in 1963 when he was elected chairman of the [[Harris County, Texas]] Republican Party. The following year, he ran against incumbent Democrat [[Ralph Yarborough|Ralph W. Yarborough]] in the [[United States Senate election in Texas, 1964|U.S. Senate race]]. He presented himself as a young Conservative Republican in contrast to the aging liberal Democrat Yarborough. He campaigned against civil rights legislation pending before Congress, stating that he believed it gave too much power to the federal government.&lt;ref name=GHWVB&gt;{{cite book |last=Naftali |first=Timothy |date=2007 |title=George H.

Bush and the Harris County Republicans played a role in the development of the new Republican Party of the late 20th century. First, Bush worked to absorb the [[John Birch Society]] members, who were trying to take over the Republican Party. Second, during and after the [[civil rights movement]], Democrats in the South who were committed to [[racial segregation|segregation]] left their party, and although the "country club Republicans" had differing ideological beliefs, they found common ground in hoping to expel the Democrats from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/bush-transcript/ |title=Program Transcript.

In 1966, Bush was elected to a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from the [[Texas's 7th congressional district|7th District of Texas]]; he won 57 percent of the ballots cast in a race against Democrat Frank Briscoe, who was the district attorney of Harris County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=47440 |title=TX District 07 |publisher=Our Campaigns |access-date=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Ex-DA-Frank-Briscoe-legal-heavyweight-for-1689920.php |title=Ex-DA Frank Briscoe, legal heavyweight for decades, dies at 84, January 5, 2011 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |access-date=March 9, 2014|date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush was the first Republican to represent Houston in the U.S. House.&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt; Bush's representative district included [[Tanglewood, Houston|Tanglewood]], the Houston neighborhood that was his residence;&lt;ref name=Hickey&gt;Hickey, Elisabeth.

In 1970, Nixon convinced Bush to relinquish his House seat in order to [[United States Senate election in Texas, 1970|run for the Senate]] against Ralph Yarborough, who was a fierce Nixon critic.

===Ambassador to the United Nations (1971–1973)===
[[File:George Bush as United Nations Representative, 1971-72 - NARA - 186386.tif|thumb|Bush as ambassador to the United Nations, 1971]]
Following his 1970 loss, Bush was well known as a prominent Republican businessman from the "[[Sun Belt]]", a group of states in the Southern part of the country.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; Nixon noticed and appreciated the sacrifice Bush had made of his Congressional position,&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt; so he appointed him [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]].&lt;ref name="cnn" /&gt; He was confirmed unanimously by the Senate, and served for two years, beginning in 1971.&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt;

His ambassadorship was marked by a notable defeat on the China question. On October 25, 1971, the General Assembly voted to expel the [[Republic of China]] and replace it with the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref name="nytimes19711031"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Austin |first1=Anthony |title=Crushing Defeat for the U.S., or A Blessing In Disguise? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/31/archives/crushing-defeat-for-the-us-or-a-blessing-in-disguise-enter-peking.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 31, 1971 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush was hissed when he got up to speak, and the delegates cheered and danced after defeating a US motion to require a two-thirds [[supermajority]].&lt;ref name="nytimes_obituary"/&gt; The resolution then won a two-thirds supermajority anyway, as the United States lost the support of every [[NATO]] country.&lt;ref name="nytimes19711031"/&gt; Although Bush condemned the "gladiatorial ugliness" of the debate,&lt;ref name="nytimes_obituary"/&gt; he advocated friendly relations with the Chinese delegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Szulc |first1=Tad |title=Correct but Relaxed Dealings With Chinese Urged by Bush |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/09/archives/correct-but-relaxed-dealings-with-chinese-urged-by-bush.html |work=The New York Times |date=November 9, 1971 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, Bush even placed himself in the position of depending on a Chinese veto in the [[United Nations Secretary-General selection, 1971|1971 Secretary-General selection]].

President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Bush to be Chief of the [[De facto embassy#China and the United States|U.S. Liaison Office]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Since the United States maintained diplomatic relations with the [[Republic of China|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] instead of the People's Republic of China, Bush did not hold the [[diplomatic rank]] of ambassador. However, Bush acted like an ambassador anyway, ignoring instructions from [[Henry Kissinger]] to stay away from diplomatic functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bush |first1=George H.

Bush decided in the late 1970s that he was going to run for president in 1980; in 1979, he attended 850 political events ("[[Audition|cattle calls]]") and traveled more than {{convert|250000|mi|km}} to campaign for the nation's highest office. In the contest for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination, Bush stressed his wide range of government experience, while competing against rivals Senator [[Howard Baker]] of Tennessee, Senator [[Bob Dole]] of Kansas, Congressman [[John B.

The two men agreed to a debate in the state, organized by ''[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Nashua Telegraph]]'', but paid for by the Reagan campaign. Reagan invited the other four candidates as well, but Bush refused to debate them, and eventually they left. The debate proved to be a pivotal moment in the campaign; when the moderator, John Breen, ordered Reagan's microphone turned off, his angry response, "I am paying for this microphone," struck a chord with the public. Bush ended up losing New Hampshire's primary with 23% to Reagan's 50%. Bush lost most of the remaining primaries as well, and formally dropped out of the race in May of that year.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;

==Vice presidency (1981–1989)==
{{See also|Presidency of Ronald Reagan}}

===First term, 1981–1985===
As vice president, Bush generally maintained a typically low profile while he recognized the constitutional limits of the office; he avoided decision-making or criticizing Reagan in any way. As had become customary, he and his wife moved into the Vice President's residence at [[Number One Observatory Circle]], about two miles from the [[White House]]. After selling the house in [[Tanglewood, Houston|Tanglewood]], the Bushes declared a room in [[The Houstonian Hotel]] in [[Houston]] as their official voting address.&lt;ref name=Hickey /&gt; The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions, including many [[state funeral]]s, which became a common joke for comedians. Mrs. Bush found the funerals largely beneficial, saying, "George met with many current or future heads of state at the funerals he attended, enabling him to forge personal relationships that were important to President Reagan." As the [[Vice President of the United States#Roles of the vice president|President of the Senate]], Bush stayed in contact with members of Congress and kept the president informed on occurrences on Capitol Hill.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;

On March 30, 1981 (early into the administration), [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|Reagan was shot]] and seriously wounded by [[John Hinckley Jr.]] in Washington, D.C. Bush was in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and immediately flew back to Washington D.C. because he was next in line to the presidency. Reagan's cabinet convened in the White House [[Situation Room]], where they discussed various issues, including the availability of the "[[nuclear football]]". When Bush's plane landed, he was advised by his aides to proceed directly to the White House by helicopter as an image of the government still functioning despite the attack. Bush rejected the idea, responding, "Only the President lands on the South Lawn."&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; This made a positive impression on Reagan,&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; who recovered and returned to work within two weeks. From then on, the two men would have regular Thursday lunches in the [[Oval Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bumiller |first=Elisabeth |date=June 9, 2004 |title=The 40th President: Between 2 First Families, A Complicated Rapport |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/09/us/40th-president-presidential-relations-between-2-first-families-complicated.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1982, Bush toured [[Africa]], the first instance of a high United States government official visiting the continent since the Reagan administration began. Bush told reporters that while he would allow for heads of state to dictate how each meeting would transpire, there was an expectation on his part for discussions on the independence of [[Namibia]], adding that the United States was going to retain the position of no settlement in Namibia until Cuban troops in [[Angola]] were withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/10/Vice-President-George-Bush-acting-as-the-presidents-personal/4018405752400/ |title=Vice President George Bush, acting as the president's personal... |first=Jim |last=Anderson |date=November 10, 1982 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, Bush met with [[United States Secretary of State]] [[George P. Shultz]] and [[Yuri Andropov]] in Moscow, Russia, to discuss human rights and arms reductions. Bush later said, "The meeting was frank, cordial and substantive. It gave both sides the opportunity to exchange views on the state of their relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/15/Vice-President-George-Bush-and-Secretary-of-State-George/2659406184400/ |title=Vice President George Bush and Secretary of State George... |first=Steven R. |last=Reed |date=November 15, 1982 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of January 1983, Bush began a seven-day tour of [[Western Europe]] intended to promote the arms reduction commitment being advocated for by the Reagan administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/31/world/bush-starts-7-nation-trip-in-bonn-aim-is-to-reassure-allies-on-arms.html |title=Bush Starts 7-Nation Trip In Bonn; Aim Is To Reassure Allies On Arms |date=January 31, 1983 |first=James M. |last=Markham |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a February 8 news conference in Paris, Bush said the United States' invitations for the Soviet Union to consent to a reduction in medium-range missiles were supported by Western Europe, which he stated had also consented to the deployment of new American missiles starting in the latter part of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/09/world/bush-in-paris-says-allies-commitment-on-missiles-remains-firm.html |title=Bush, In Paris, Says Allies' Commitment On Missiles Remains Firm |first=John |last=Vinocur |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Bush defended American nuclear arms policy when answering British Secretary General of the Committee on Nuclear Disarmament [[Bruce Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/10/world/bush-in-london-challenged-by-nuclear-foe.html |title=Bush, In London, Challenged By Nuclear Foe |first=John |last=Vinocur |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1983, Bush met with [[President of Romania]] [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], insisting during the meeting that President Reagan intended to push for arms reductions at the Geneva talks with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/09/18/Vice-President-George-Bush-met-Sunday-with-President-Nicholae/1371432705600/ |title=Vice President George Bush met Sunday with President Nicholae... |first=Cathy |last=Booth |date=September 18, 1983 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Bush said the United States wanted better relations with all countries within the [[Eastern Bloc]] though he stressed that NATO would retaliate in the event of any threatening of European military stability by the Soviets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/09/19/Vice-President-George-Bush-Monday-praised-Communist-Hungarys-human/2242432792000/ |title=Vice President George Bush Monday praised Communist Hungary's human... |first=Ruth E. |last=Gruber |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the vice president assailed the Soviet Union for the [[Berlin Wall]] and destroying the [[Korean Airlines Flight 007|Korean Air Lines jetliner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/09/21/Vice-President-George-Bush-today-accused-the-Soviet-Union/1835432964800/ |title=Vice President George Bush today accused the Soviet Union... |first=Ruth E. |last=Gruber |date=September 21, 1983 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1983 Bush flew to [[El Salvador]] and warned that country's military leaders to end their [[death squad]]s and hold fully free elections or face the loss of U.S. aid. "It is not just the President, it is not just me or the Congress. If these death-squad murders continue, you will lose the support of the American people and that would indeed be a tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/12/world/in-salvador-bush-assails-death-squads.html |title=In Salvador, Bush Assails Death Squads |first=Lydia |last=Chavez |date=December 12, 1983 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush's aides feared for his safety and thought about calling the meeting off when they discovered apparent blood stains on the floor of the presidential palace of [[Álvaro Magaña]].

Bush was assigned by Reagan to chair two special task forces, on [[deregulation]] and international drug smuggling. The deregulation task force reviewed hundreds of rules, making specific recommendations on which ones to amend or revise, in order to curb the size of the federal government. The drug smuggling task force coordinated federal efforts to reduce the quantity of drugs entering the United States. Both were popular issues with conservatives, and Bush, largely a moderate, began courting them through his work.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;

On June 14, 1984, Bush cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate in favor of the 10-warhead [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX missile system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/06/14/Vice-President-George-Bush-cast-a-dramatic-tie-breaking-vote/3222456033600/ |title=Vice President George Bush cast a dramatic, tie-breaking vote... |first=Eliot |last=Brenner |date=June 14, 1984 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan and Bush [[1984 United States presidential election|ran for reelection in 1984]]. Their [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent, [[Walter Mondale]], made history by choosing a woman, New York Representative [[Geraldine Ferraro]], as his running mate. She and Bush squared off in [[United States vice-presidential debate, 1984|a single televised vice presidential debate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showdebate.php?debateid=27 |title=Bush-Ferraro Vice-Presidential Debate |date=October 11, 1984 |access-date=April 3, 2008 |publisher=The American Presidency Project |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617164446/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showdebate.php?debateid=27 |archivedate=June 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferraro served as a contrast to the Ivy-League educated Bush; she represented a [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] district in [[Queens]], New York. This distinction and her popularity among female journalists left Bush at a disadvantage. Regardless, the Reagan-Bush ticket won in a landslide against the Mondale-Ferraro ticket. Early into his second term as vice president, Bush and his aides were planning a run for the presidency in 1988. By the end of 1985, a committee had been established and over two million dollars were raised for Bush.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;

On July 13, 1985, Bush became the first vice president to serve as [[Acting President of the United States|acting president]] when Reagan underwent surgery to remove [[polyp (medicine)|polyps]] from his [[Large intestine|colon]]; Bush served as the acting president for approximately eight hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boyd |first=Gerald M. |date=July 14, 1985 |title=Reagan Transfers Power to Bush For 8-Hour Period of 'Incapacity' |page=A1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/14/us/reagan-transfers-power-to-bush-for-8-hour-period-of-incapacity.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the Reagan administration was shaken by a scandal when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to Iran. The officials had used the proceeds to fund the anti-communist [[Contras]] in Nicaragua, which was a direct violation of law. The scandal became known as the [[Iran–Contra affair]]. When news of the public embarrassment broke to the media, Bush, like Reagan, stated that he had been "out of the loop" and unaware of the diversion of funds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/iran-transcript.html |title=Transcript |work=The New York Times |date=June 30, 1997 |access-date=April 2, 2008 |format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this was later questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB210/index.htm |title=The Iran-Contra Affair 20 Years On |date=November 20, 2006 |access-date=April 3, 2008 |publisher=George Washington University}}&lt;/ref&gt; His diaries from that time stated "I'm one of the few people that know fully the details" and as a result of six pardons by Bush, the independent counsel's final report on the Iran–Contra affair pointedly noted: "The criminal investigation of Bush was regrettably incomplete."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB210/index.htm |title=The Iran-Contra Affair 20 Years On |publisher=Gwu.edu |access-date=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1986, Bush outlined the government's policy on the combating of terrorism. In an interagency task force report presented to President Reagan, Bush publicly stated that the strategy of the federal government was to retaliate without "wantonly" terminating human lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/07/world/bush-issuing-terror-report-affirms-current-us-policies.html |title=Bush, Issuing Terror Report, Affirms Current U.S. Policies |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 7, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1986, Bush underwent a procedure to remove a malignant growth from his left cheek. His spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said that doctors had found the growth weeks earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/18/us/bush-has-malignancy-removed-from-cheek.html |title=Bush Has Malignancy Removed From Cheek |date=May 18, 1986 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 1988, the [[Cruiser#Late 20th century|guided missile cruiser]] {{USS|Vincennes|CG-49|6}} accidentally shot down [[Iran Air Flight 655]], killing 290 passengers. Bush said that he would "never apologize for the United States of America. Ever.

As early as 1985, Bush had been planning a presidential run; he entered the Republican primary for President of the United States in October 1987.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; His challengers for the Republican presidential nomination included U.S. Senator [[Bob Dole]] of [[Kansas]], U.S. Representative [[Jack Kemp]] of New York, former Governor [[Pete du Pont]] of [[Delaware]], and conservative Christian [[Televangelism|televangelist]] [[Pat Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shogan |first=Robert |date=February 9, 1988 |title=Politics 88 : Dole, Gephardt Win; Bush Third : Robertson Is a Surprise 2nd in GOP Polling |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-09/news/mn-41620_1_george-bush |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dionne Jr. |first=E.

Bush was considered the early frontrunner for the nomination, but he came in third in the Iowa caucus, behind winner Dole and runner-up Robertson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/10/us/bush-and-simon-seen-as-hobbled-by-iowa-s-voting.html |title=Bush and Simon Seen as Hobbled by Iowa's Voting |date=February 10, 1988 |access-date=April 4, 2008 |work=The New York Times |first=R.

Apple Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much as Reagan had done in 1980, Bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the New Hampshire primary.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; With Dole ahead in New Hampshire, Bush ran television commercials portraying the senator as a tax raiser;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&amp;display_order=1&amp;content_type_id=57687&amp;mini_id=57351 |title=New Hampshire: Picking a President |publisher=The History Channel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424102704/http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&amp;display_order=1&amp;content_type_id=57687&amp;mini_id=57351 |archivedate=April 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; he rebounded to win the state's primary. Following the primary, Bush and Dole had a joint media appearance, when the interviewer asked Dole if he had anything to say to Bush, Dole said, in response to the ads, "yeah, stop lying about my record!" in an angry tone. This is thought to have hurt Dole's campaign to Bush's benefit. Bush continued seeing victory, winning many Southern primaries as well.&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt; Once the multiple-state primaries such as [[Super Tuesday]] began, Bush's organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match, and the nomination was his.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt;

As the [[1988 Republican National Convention]] approached, there was much speculation who Bush would choose to be his running mate. He selected little-known U.S. Senator [[Dan Quayle]] of [[Indiana]], who was favored by conservatives. Despite Reagan's popularity, Bush trailed Democratic nominee [[Michael Dukakis]], then [[Governor of Massachusetts]], in most polls.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/news/national/election2000/conventions/past.bushsenior.html |title=1988: George H. W. Bush Gives the 'Speech of his Life' |publisher=NPR |year=2000 |access-date=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush was occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to Reagan, but he delivered a well-received speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention. Known as the "[[thousand points of light]]" speech, the presentation described Bush's vision of America. He endorsed the [[Pledge of Allegiance]], [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]], and [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|gun rights]], and drew upon his long-standing Christian beliefs to support both [[school prayer|prayer in schools]] and [[United States anti-abortion movement|oppose abortion]].&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; The speech at the convention included Bush's famous pledge: "[[Read my lips: no new taxes]]."&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/9/newsid_3655000/3655368.stm |title=1988: Bush wins with 'no new taxes' promise |access-date=April 4, 2008 |date=November 9, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ElectoralCollege1988.svg|thumb|left|The 1988 presidential electoral votes by state]]
The general election campaign between the two men was described in 2008 as one of the dirtiest in modern times.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Bush blamed Dukakis for polluting the [[Boston Harbor]] as the Governor of Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt; Bush also pointed out that Dukakis was opposed to a law that would require all students to say the Pledge of Allegiance, a topic well covered in Bush's nomination acceptance speech.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

Dukakis's unconditional opposition to capital punishment led to a pointed question being asked during the presidential debates. Moderator [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]] asked Dukakis if he would hypothetically support the death penalty if his wife, [[Kitty Dukakis|Kitty]], were raped and murdered.&lt;ref name="kittyd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.debates.org/pages/trans88b.html |title=The Second Bush-Dukakis Presidential Debate |date=October 13, 1988 |publisher=[[Commission on Presidential Debates]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406032116/http://www.debates.org/pages/trans88b.html |archivedate=April 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dukakis's response of no, as well as a provocative ad about convicted felon [[Willie Horton]], contributed toward Bush's characterization of Dukakis as "soft on crime".&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt;

Bush defeated Dukakis and his running mate, [[Lloyd Bentsen]], in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], by 426 to 111 (Bentsen received one vote from a [[faithless elector]]).&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In the nationwide popular vote, Bush took 53.4% of the ballots cast while Dukakis received 45.6%.&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt; Bush became the first serving vice president to be elected president since [[Martin Van Buren]] in 1836 as well as the first person to succeed someone from his own party to the presidency via election to the office in his own right since [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;

Early in his term, Bush faced the problem of what to do with leftover [[National debt of the United States|deficits]] spawned during the Reagan years. At $220&amp;nbsp;billion in 1990, the deficit had tripled since 1980. Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade the [[101st United States Congress|Democratic controlled Congress]] to act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut [[government spending]], and Democrats convinced that the only way would be to [[income tax|raise taxes]], Bush faced problems when it came to consensus building.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt;

In the wake of a struggle with Congress, Bush was forced by the Democratic majority to raise tax revenues; as a result, many Republicans felt betrayed because Bush had promised "no new taxes" in his 1988 campaign. Perceiving a means of revenge, Republican congressmen defeated Bush's proposal, which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500&amp;nbsp;billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and gave way to a sharp [[United States presidential approval rating|decrease in popularity]]. Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; Near the end of the [[101st United States Congress|101st Congress]], the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the [[capital gains tax]], Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be a turning point in the Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt;

Coming at around the same time as the budget deal, America entered into a mild recession, lasting for six months. Many government programs, such as welfare, increased.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; As the unemployment rate edged upward in 1991, Bush signed a bill providing additional benefits for unemployed workers.&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt; The year 1991 was marked by many corporate reorganizations, which laid off a substantial number of workers. Many now unemployed were Republicans and independents, who had believed that their jobs were secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Locin |first1=Mitchell |last2=Thomas |first2=Karen M. |date=October 2, 1991 |title=As politicians fight, jobless get angrier |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-10-02-9103300224-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By his second year in office, Bush was told by his economic advisors to stop dealing with the economy, as they believed that he had done everything necessary to ensure his reelection. By 1992, interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years, but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7.8%, the highest since 1984. In September 1992, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] reported that 14.2% of all Americans [[Poverty|lived in poverty]].&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt; At a press conference in 1990, Bush told reporters that he found foreign policy more enjoyable.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt;

On April 5, 1989, Bush submitted to Congress the Educational Excellence Act of 1989, a seven program education legislative proposal with the intent of achieving "a better-educated America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/272 |title=Message to the Congress Transmitting Proposed Legislation on Educational Excellence |date=April 5, 1989 |publisher=George H.

[[File:Bush I approval rating.png|thumb|left|Bush's approval ratings (red) compared to his disapproval ratings (blue) for his four-year presidency]]

In the [[1990 State of the Union Address]], Bush revealed his interest in his administration spearheading the increase in American high school graduation rates to 90% along with making American students "first in the world" in the subjects of math and science by 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/01/31/Highlights-of-President-Bushs-State-of-the-Union-speech/3977633762000/ |title=Highlights of President Bush's State of the Union speech |date=January 31, 2006 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/01/31/Bush-urges-deeper-troop-cuts-in-State-of-the-Union/9454633762000/ |title=Bush urges deeper troop cuts in State of the Union |first=Norman D. |last=Sandler |date=January 31, 1990 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in the White House East Room on April 18, 1991, Bush called for both public and private citizens to become involved with education reform: "To those who want to see real improvement in American education, I say there will be no renaissance without revolution. It's time we held our schools, and ourselves, accountable for results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/11/25/Bush-makes-plug-for-troubled-schools/2906250094671/ |title=Bush presents education reform package |first=Janet |last=Bass |date=April 19, 1991 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, Bush advocated for community participation in reforming the national education system and insisting America 2000 would fail "if we try to do it from Washington itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/3054 |title=Remarks to Education Leaders |quote=So, what we talk about in the America 2000 strategy, you put into action.

On July 23, 1992, Bush signed the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, a resuming of "many programs in the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/4601 |title=Statement on Signing the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 |publisher=George H.

During his presidency, Bush signed a number of major bills into law, including the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]; this was one of the most pro-[[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] bills in decades. He was also the only president to successfully veto a civil rights act, having vetoed the job-discrimination protection [[Civil Rights Act of 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Devroy|Devroy, Ann]].

He also signed the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] which provides monetary compensation of people who had contracted cancer and a number of other specified diseases as a direct result of their exposure to atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing]] undertaken by the United States during the [[Cold War]], or their exposure to high levels of [[radon]] while doing [[uranium mining]]. In dealing with the environment, Bush reauthorized the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], requiring cleaner burning fuels. He quarreled with Congress over an eventually signed bill to aid police in capturing criminals, and signed into law a measure to improve the nation's highway system.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; Bush signed the [[Immigration Act of 1990]],&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WDV40aK1T-sC&amp;pg=PA282#v=onepage Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics: African Americans and Asian Americans]''".

Bush became a life member of the [[National Rifle Association]] early in 1988 and had campaigned as a "pro-gun" candidate with the NRA's endorsement.&lt;ref name="Feldman2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=Richard |authorlink= |title=Ricochet: Confessions of a Gun Lobbyist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zi5yAwWxa50C |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-13100-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1989, he placed a temporary ban on the import of certain semiautomatic rifles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law |volume=1 |first=Gregg Lee |last=Carter |page=38 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-57607-268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action cost him endorsement from the NRA in 1992. Bush publicly resigned his life membership in the organization after receiving a form letter from the NRA depicting agents of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] as "jack-booted thugs."

===Points of Light===
{{Main|Points of Light}}
President Bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of America's most serious social problems. He often used the "[[thousand points of light]]" theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems. In his 1989 inaugural address, President Bush said, "I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good."&lt;ref name="President's Report"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Points of Light Movement: The President's Report to the Nation |publisher=Executive Office of the President, 1993 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Points_of_light_movement.html?id=cH8vlwSAjv0C |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StromThurmond GeorgeBush.jpg|thumb|left|President Bush presents Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in a ceremony in the Oval Office.]]

Four years later, in his report to the nation on The Points of Light Movement, President Bush said, "Points of Light are the soul of America. They are ordinary people who reach beyond themselves to touch the lives of those in need, bringing hope and opportunity, care and friendship. By giving so generously of themselves, these remarkable individuals show us not only what is best in our heritage but what all of us are called to become."&lt;ref name="President's Report" /&gt;

In 1990, the Points of Light Foundation was created as a nonprofit organization in Washington to promote this spirit of [[Volunteering|volunteerism]].&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;{{cite journal |last=Perry |first=Suzanne |title=After Two Tough Years, New Points of Light Charity Emerges |journal=Chronicle of Philanthropy |date=October 15, 2009 |url=http://philanthropy.com/article/After-Two-Tough-Years-New/57753/ |access-date=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Points of Light Foundation merged with the [[Hands on Network]] with the goal of strengthening volunteerism, streamlining costs and services and deepening impact.&lt;ref name=Edward&gt;{{cite journal |last=Edward |first=Deborah |title=Getting to Yes: The Points of Light and Hands On Network Merger |journal=RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service, the University of Texas at Austin |year=2008 |url=http://www.rgkcenter.org/sites/default/files/file/research/gettingtoyes.pdf |access-date=May 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061145/http://www.rgkcenter.org/sites/default/files/file/research/gettingtoyes.pdf |archivedate=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Points of Light]], the organization created through this merger, has approximately 250 affiliates in 22 countries and partnerships with thousands of nonprofits and companies dedicated to volunteer service around the world.

On October 16, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] held a Presidential Forum on Service hosted by former President George H. W. Bush and Points of Light at the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] Center on the campus of [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. The event celebrated the contributions of more than 4,500 Daily Point of Light award winners and honored President Bush's legacy of service and civic engagement.&lt;ref name="Presidential Forum"&gt;{{cite news |title=President Obama to Hold Presidential Forum on Service Hosted by former President George H.W.

===Daily Point of Light Award===
President Bush created the Daily Point of Light Award in 1989 to recognize ordinary Americans from all walks of life taking direct and consequential voluntary action in their communities to solve serious social problems. The President focused great attention on these individuals and organizations, both to honor them for their tremendous work and to call the nation to join them and multiply their efforts. By the end of his administration, President Bush had recognized 1,020 Daily Points of Light representing all 50 states and addressing issues ranging from care for infants and teenagers with AIDS to adult illiteracy and from gang violence to job training for the [[Homelessness|homeless]].&lt;ref name="President's Report" /&gt; The Daily Point of Light continues to be awarded by Points of Light; up until his death President Bush continued to sign all of the awards.&lt;ref name=Leader-Telegram&gt;{{cite news |title=Health Matters 07/10/13 |url=http://www.leadertelegram.com/features/health/article_59336b2a-6092-5baa-b8c0-dab07e3ea301.html |access-date=July 11, 2013 |newspaper=Leader-Telegram |date=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial appointments===

Bush made two appointments to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]&amp;nbsp;— [[David Souter]] in 1990, and [[Clarence Thomas]] in 1991. Additionally, he appointed 42 judges to the [[United States courts of appeals]] and 148 judges to the [[United States district court]]s.

[[File:George H. W. Bush on telephone.jpg|thumb|Bush speaks on the telephone regarding Operation Just Cause as General [[Brent Scowcroft]] and Chief of Staff [[John H. Sununu]] look on, 1989]]

In the 1980s, Panamanian leader [[Manuel Noriega]], a once U.S.-supportive leader who was later accused of spying for [[Fidel Castro]] and using Panama to traffic drugs into the United States, was one of the most recognizable names in America and was constantly in the press. The struggle to remove him from power began in the Reagan administration, when economic sanctions were imposed on the country; this included prohibiting American companies and government from making payments to Panama and freezing $56&amp;nbsp;million in Panamanian funds in American banks. Reagan sent more than 2,000 American troops to Panama as well.&lt;ref name="rutgers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~hbf/panama.htm |title=Panama: Background and Buildup to Invasion of 1989 |access-date=April 11, 2008 |author=Franklin, Jane |year=2001 |publisher=Rutgers University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Reagan, Bush was able to remove Noriega from power, but his administration's unsuccessful post-invasion planning hindered the needs of Panama during the establishment of the young democratic government.&lt;ref name="texas"&gt;{{cite web |title=Prudence in Panama: George H.

In May 1989, Panama held democratic elections, in which [[Guillermo Endara]] was elected president; the results were then annulled by Noriega's government. In response, Bush sent 2,000 more troops to the country, where they began conducting regular military exercises in Panamanian territory (in violation of prior treaties). Bush then removed an embassy and [[Ambassadors of the United States|ambassador]] from the country, and dispatched additional troops to Panama to prepare the way for an upcoming invasion.&lt;ref name="rutgers" /&gt; Noriega suppressed an October [[Coup d'état|military coup]] attempt and massive protests in Panama against him, but after a U.S. serviceman was shot by Panamanian forces in December 1989, Bush ordered 24,000 troops into the country with an objective of removing Noriega from power;&lt;ref name="secdef"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/secdef_histories/bios/cheney.htm |title=Richard B.

[[File:Bush Gorba P15623-25A.jpg|thumb|left|Bush and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in Helsinki summit in 1990]]

In 1989, just after the [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Berlin Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]], Bush met with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in [[Malta Summit|a conference]] on the Mediterranean island of [[Malta]]. The administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the Soviets, but not all initially found the [[Malta Summit]] to be a step in the right direction; General [[Brent Scowcroft]], among others, was apprehensive about the meeting, saying that it might be "premature" due to concerns where, according to [[Condoleezza Rice]], "expectations [would be] set that something was going to happen, where the Soviets might grandstand and force [the U.S.] into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the United States." But European leaders, including [[François Mitterrand]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], encouraged Bush to meet with Gorbachev,&lt;ref name="dr rice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-24/rice1.html |publisher=George Washington University |access-date=April 11, 2008 |title=Interview with Dr. Condoleezza Rice |date=December 17, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; something that he did on December 2 and 3, 1989. Although no agreements were signed, the meeting was viewed largely as being an important one; when asked about nuclear war, Gorbachev responded, "I assured the President of the United States that the Soviet Union would never start a hot war against the United States of America. And we would like our relations to develop in such a way that they would open greater possibilities for cooperation... This is just the beginning. We are just at the very beginning of our road, long road to a long-lasting, peaceful period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/04/world/the-malta-summit-transcript-of-the-bush-gorbachev-news-conference-in-malta.html |title=The Malta Summit; Transcript of the Bush-Gorbachev News Conference in Malta |agency=Associated Press |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 11, 2008 |date=December 4, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was received as a very important step to the end of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_4119000/4119950.stm |title=1989: Malta summit ends Cold War |access-date=April 11, 2008 |date=December 3, 1989 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another summit was held in July 1991, where the [[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I)]] was signed by Bush and Gorbachev in Moscow. The treaty took nine years in the making and was the first major arms agreement since the signing of the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] by Reagan and Gorbachev in 1987. The contentions in START would reduce the strategic nuclear weapons of the United States and the USSR by about 35% over seven years, and the Soviet Union's land-based [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s would be cut by 50%. Bush described START as "a significant step forward in dispelling half a century of mistrust".&lt;ref name="bbc moscow"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/31/newsid_4582000/4582773.stm |date=July 31, 1991 |access-date=April 11, 2008 |publisher=BBC News |title=1991: Superpowers to cut nuclear warheads}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)#Dissolution_of_the_USSR|dissolution of the USSR]] in 1991, President Bush and Russian president [[Boris Yeltsin]] declared a U.S.–Russian strategic partnership, marking the end of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wines |first=Michael |date=February 2, 1992 |title=Bush and Yeltsin Declare Formal End to Cold War; Agree to Exchange Visits |page=A1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/02/world/bush-and-yeltsin-declare-formal-end-to-cold-war-agree-to-exchange-visits.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gulf War====

[[File:Bush troops.jpg|thumb|President Bush visits American troops in [[Saudi Arabia]] on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]], 1990]]

On August 2, 1990, Iraq, led by [[Saddam Hussein]], invaded its oil-rich neighbor to the south, [[Kuwait]]; Bush condemned the invasion&lt;ref name="pbs-gulfwar"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/cron/ |title=The Gulf War: A Chronology |access-date=April 11, 2008 |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began rallying opposition to Iraq in the United States and among European, Asian, and Middle Eastern allies.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]] traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet with [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]]; Fahd requested United States military aid in the matter, fearing a possible invasion of his country as well.&lt;ref name="pbs-gulfwar" /&gt; The request was met initially with [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] fighter jets. Iraq made attempts to negotiate a deal that would allow the country to take control of half of Kuwait. Bush rejected this proposal and insisted on a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; The planning of a ground operation by U.S.-led coalition forces began forming in September 1990, headed by General [[Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.]].&lt;ref name="pbs-gulfwar" /&gt; Bush spoke before a joint session of the [[United States Congress]] regarding the authorization of air and land attacks, laying out four immediate objectives: "Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely, immediately, and without condition. Kuwait's legitimate government must be restored. The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured. And American citizens abroad must be protected." He then outlined a fifth, long-term objective: "Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective&amp;nbsp;— a new world order&amp;nbsp;— can emerge: a new era&amp;nbsp;— freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony&amp;nbsp;... A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle.

Early on the morning of January 17, 1991, allied forces launched the first attack, which included more than 4,000 bombing runs by coalition aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/2625 Address to the Nation Announcing Allied Military Action in the Persian Gulf (January 16, 1991)]&lt;/ref&gt; This pace would continue for the next four weeks, until a ground invasion was launched on February 24, 1991. Allied forces penetrated Iraqi lines and pushed toward [[Kuwait City]] while on the west side of the country, forces were intercepting the retreating Iraqi army. Bush made the decision to stop the offensive after a mere 100 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/2746 Address to the Nation on the Suspension of Allied Offensive Combat Operations in the Persian Gulf (February 27, 1991)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0227.html |title=Bush Halts Offensive Combat; Kuwait Freed, Iraqis Crushed |date=February 28, 1991 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics labeled this decision premature, as hundreds of Iraqi forces were able to escape; Bush responded by saying that he wanted to minimize U.S. casualties. Opponents further charged that Bush should have continued the attack, pushing Hussein's army back to Baghdad, then removing him from power.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; Bush explained that he did not give the order to overthrow the Iraqi government because it would have "incurred incalculable human and political costs... We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/gulfwar.asp |title=A World Transformed |year=2003 |access-date=April 11, 2008 |publisher=Snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's approval ratings skyrocketed after the successful offensive.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; Additionally, President Bush and Secretary of State Baker felt the coalition victory had increased U.S. prestige abroad and believed there was a window of opportunity to use the political capital generated by the coalition victory to revitalize the Arab-Israeli peace process. The administration immediately returned to Arab-Israeli peacemaking following the end of the Gulf War; this resulted in the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|Madrid Conference]], later in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Middle East Review of International Affairs Journal Volume 6, No. 1 – March 2002 [http://www.rubincenter.org/2002/03/lasensky-2002-03-07/ Underwriting Peace in the Middle East: U.S. Foreign Policy and the Limits of Economic Inducements]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Somali Civil War====
{{Main|Somali Civil War}}
Faced with a humanitarian disaster in [[Somalia]] that was exacerbated by a complete breakdown in civil order, the United Nations had created the [[United Nations Operation in Somalia I|UNOSOM I]] mission in April 1992 to aid the situation through humanitarian efforts, though the mission failed.&lt;ref name=UNDP&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/Depts/DPKO/Missions/unosomi.htm |title=UNITED NATIONS OPERATION IN SOMALIA I, UN Dept of Peacekeeping |publisher=United Nations |access-date=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush administration proposed American aid to the region by assisting in creating a secure environment for humanitarian efforts and UN Resolution 794 was unanimously adopted by the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] on December 3, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Security Council Resolution 794&lt;/ref&gt; A [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] president, Bush launched [[Unified Task Force|Operation Restore Hope]] the following day under which the United States would assume command in accordance with Resolution 794.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George H., Address to the Nation on the Situation in Somalia, 4/12/92&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting would escalate and continue into the Clinton administration.&lt;ref name=Atkinson94&gt;{{cite news |journal=The Washington Post ''(online, January 31)'' |author=Atkinson, Rick |date=1994 |title=Night of a Thousand Casualties |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/01/31/night-of-a-thousand-casualties/1f0c97b1-1605-46e5-9466-ba3599120c25/ | access-date=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Japan ====
During an April 28, 1989 appearance in the press room of the White House, Bush announced that the U.S. would continue a deal with Japan to produce the FSX advanced fighter jet. He said that promises had been made that American jobs and technology would be safe and the proposal would bolster security for both the U.S. and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-30/news/mn-2867_1_fsx-japan-s-ambassador-nobuo-matsunaga-japan-s-mitsubishi-heavy-industries |title=Bush Clears Way for FSX Fighter Deal With Japan |date=April 30, 1989 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21, 1989, Bush signed a measure that guaranteed reparations to Japanese-Americans who were relocated into [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment camps]] during [[World War II]]. Congress authorized US$20,000 ({{Inflation|US|20000|1989|fmt=eq}}) for each survivor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-22/news/mn-164_1_bush-signs |title=Bush Signs Japanese-American Reparation Guarantee |date=November 22, 1989 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 1990, Bush met for an hour with former [[Prime Minister of Japan]] [[Noboru Takeshita]] to discuss shared economic issues and "the fact that their solution will require extraordinary efforts on both sides of the Pacific."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/03/12/Former-Japanese-Prime-Minister-Meets-Bush/7513637218000/ |title=Former Japanese Prime Minister Meets Bush |first=Norman D. |last=Sandler |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 1991, Japanese Prime Minister [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] apologized to the United States for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The following day&amp;nbsp;— fiftieth anniversary of the attack&amp;nbsp;— Bush accepted Japan's apology for the event that drew the United States into World War II.

On June 18, 1990, [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Marlin Fitzwater]] confirmed President Bush had sent [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Yitzhak Shamir]] a letter in which he congratulated the latter on his election and urged him to support the proposed "Shamir initiative for peace", which would involve the participation of Palestinian Arabians in local elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/06/18/Bush-congratulates-Shamir-pushes-peace-process/4351645681600/ |title=Bush congratulates Shamir, pushes peace process |publisher=UPI |date=June 18, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, Bush suspended American dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization for the latter's refusal to condemn the Palestinian guerrilla raid of an Israeli beach the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-21/news/mn-118_1_splinter-group |title=Bush Suspends Talks With PLO : Terrorism: President assails the organization's failure to denounce a splinter group's raid on an Israeli beach. |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=June 21, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 1992, following a meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], Bush announced he would seek the approval of Congress to bestow Israel up to $10 billion in loan guarantees to assist the country with its absorbing of Soviet Union immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/08/12/Bush-strikes-Israel-loan-deal-with-Rabin/3144713592000/ |title=Bush strikes Irael loan deal with Rabin |first=Steven |last=Heilbronner |publisher=UPI |date=August 12, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/4655 |title=The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel in Kennebunkport |date=August 11, 1992 |quote=Literally hundreds of thousands of Jews from Ethiopia and from the former Soviet Union now make their homes in Israel; and this, more than anything else, is what the Jewish state is all about.

===NAFTA===
{{Main|North American Free Trade Agreement}}

The Bush administration and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[Brian Mulroney]] spearheaded the negotiations of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). The agreement would eliminate the majority of [[tariff]]s on products that were traded among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This would encourage trade among the countries. The treaty also restricted patents, copyrights, and trademarks, and outlined the removal of investment restrictions among the three countries.&lt;ref name="fedex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fedex.com/us/customersupport/ftn/faq/nafta.html?link=4 |publisher=Federal Express |title=Frequently Asked Questions: NAFTA |access-date=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Bush announced the completion of NAFTA during a Rose Garden appearance on August 12, 1992, calling it the "beginning of a new era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/08/12/Bush-announces-new-trade-pact-with-Mexico/2321509303014/ |title=Bush announces new trade pact with Mexico |first=Helen |last=Thomas |publisher=UPI |date=August 12, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement came under heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats, who charged that NAFTA resulted in a loss of American jobs.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights; according to the Bush administration, the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable Mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws. Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote, thereby avoiding a situation in which the president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change.&lt;ref name="nafta labor"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/nafta/nafta0401-04.htm |publisher=Human Rights Watch |access-date=April 11, 2008 |title=The NAFTA Labor Side Accord}}&lt;/ref&gt; While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress.

The treaty has since been defended as well as criticized further. The American economy has grown 54% since the adoption of NAFTA in 1993, with 25&amp;nbsp;million new jobs created; this was seen by some as evidence of NAFTA being beneficial to the United States.&lt;ref name="wapo-nafta"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/29/AR2008022902608.html |title=Stop Hating on NAFTA |work=The Washington Post |author=Gutierrez, Carlos M |date=March 1, 2008 |access-date=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With talk in early 2008 regarding a possible American withdrawal from the treaty, [[Carlos Gutierrez|Carlos M.

Sweeney, President of the AFL-CIO, wrote in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' that "the [[Foreign trade of the United States|U.S. trade deficit]] with Canada and Mexico ballooned to twelve times its pre-NAFTA size, reaching $111&amp;nbsp;billion in 2004."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0321-31.htm |title=A Bad Deal on Free Trade |last=Sweeney |first=John J |work=The Boston Globe |access-date=April 11, 2008 |date=March 21, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915030224/http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0321-31.htm |archive-date=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/220/47255.html |title=A Bad Deal on Free Trade |last=Sweeney |first=John J |work=The Boston Globe |access-date=December 1, 2018 |date=March 21, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pardons===
{{Main|List of people pardoned by George H. W. Bush}}
In keeping with tradition, Bush issued a series of pardons during his last days in office. On December 24, 1992, he granted executive clemency to six former government employees implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal of the late 1980s, most prominently former Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]].&lt;ref name="scientists"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/news/iran/1992/921224-260039.htm |title=Bush pardons Weinberger, Five Other Tied to Iran-Contra |access-date=April 11, 2008 |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421150512/http://www.fas.org/news/iran/1992/921224-260039.htm |archivedate=April 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush described Weinberger, who was scheduled to stand trial on January 5, 1993, for criminal charges related to Iran-Contra, as a "true American patriot".&lt;ref name="scientists" /&gt;

In addition to Weinberger, Bush pardoned Duane R. Clarridge, Clair E. George, [[Robert McFarlane|Robert C. McFarlane]], [[Elliott Abrams]], and Alan G. Fiers Jr., all of whom had been indicted and/or convicted of criminal charges by an [[United States Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel|Independent Counsel]] headed by Lawrence Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/pardon/bushgrants.htm |title=Pardons and Commutations Granted by President George H.

===1992 presidential campaign===
{{Main|1992 United States presidential election}}
In early 1992, Bush announced that he would seek a second term. A coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings made re-election seem likely. As a result, many leading Democrats declined to seek their party's presidential nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kornacki |first=Steve |date=April 10, 2011 |title=The Mario Effect: Last time a group of presidential challengers was this unimpressive, there was a reason |url=https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2011/04/the-mario-effect-last-time-a-group-of-presidential-challengers-was-this-unimpressive-there-was-a-reason-067223 |work=[[Politico]] |access-date=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the negative side, Bush's popularity was reduced by an economic recession and doubts of whether he properly ended the Gulf War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kagay |first=Michael R. |date=May 22, 1991 |title=History Suggests Bush's Popularity Will Ebb |page=A18 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/22/us/history-suggests-bush-s-popularity-will-ebb.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenhouse |first=Steven |date=May 11, 1992 |title=The Economy; Despite Recession's End, Bush May Face Unusually Harsh Public Judgment |page=B8 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/11/us/1992-campaign-economy-despite-recession-s-end-bush-may-face-unusually-harsh.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative political columnist [[Pat Buchanan]] challenged Bush for the Republican nomination. He shocked political pundits by finishing second, with 37% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary. Bush responded by adopting more conservative positions on issues, in an attempt to undermine Buchanan's base.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; Once he had secured the nomination, Bush faced his Democratic challenger, [[List of Governors of Arkansas|Arkansas Governor]] [[Bill Clinton]]. Clinton attacked Bush as a politician who was not doing enough to assist the working middle-class and being "out of touch" with the common man, a notion reinforced by reporter [[Andrew Rosenthal]]'s false report that Bush was "astonished" to see a demonstration of a supermarket [[barcode reader|scanner]].&lt;ref name=Goldberg08 /&gt;&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/history/american/bushscan.htm |title=Maybe I'm Amazed |date=April 1, 2001 |access-date=April 11, 2008 |publisher=Snopes.com |archivedate=May 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527030747/http://www.snopes.com/history/american/bushscan.asp |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenthal92 /&gt;

[[File:ElectoralCollege1992.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|The 1992 presidential electoral votes by state]]
In early 1992, the race took an unexpected twist when Texas billionaire [[Ross Perot|H. Ross Perot]] launched a third party bid, claiming that neither Republicans nor Democrats could eliminate the deficit and make government more efficient. His message appealed to voters across the political spectrum disappointed with both parties' perceived fiscal irresponsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Perot Vote |publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College |access-date=April 23, 2008 |url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/case/3pt/perot_vote.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perot later bowed out of the race for a short time, then reentered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/27/us/the-1992-campaign-the-independent-bush-aide-calls-perot-s-story-paranoid.html |title=The 1992 Campaign: The Independent; Bush aide calls Perot's story 'paranoid' |date=October 27, 1992 |access-date=April 14, 2008 |work=The New York Times |last=Holmes |first=Steven A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several key factors led to Bush's defeat. The ailing economy that arose from recession may have been the main factor in Bush's loss. On Election Day, 7 in 10 voters said that the economy was either "not so good" or "poor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=R. W. |last=Apple Jr. |authorlink=R. W.

Conservative Republicans pointed out that Bush's 1990 agreement to raise taxes contradicted his famous "[[Read my lips: no new taxes]]" pledge. In doing so, Bush alienated many members of his conservative base, losing their support for his re-election. According to one survey, of the voters who cited Bush's broken "No New Taxes" pledge as "very important", two thirds voted for Bill Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Schmalz |title=Clinton Carves a Path Deep Into Reagan Country |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD8173FF937A35752C1A964958260 |work=The New York Times |date=November 4, 1992 |access-date=May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush had raised taxes in an attempt to address an increasing budget deficit, which has largely been attributed to the Reagan tax cuts and military spending of the 1980s. The tax revenue increase had not hurt his approval rating to the extent that it prevented it from reaching its highest level, 89%, by February 1991, during the [[Gulf War]], and four months after the tax vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/110499/the-illusory-power-grover-norquist The Illusory Power of Grover Norquist], Timothy Noah, November 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/116677/presidential-approval-ratings-gallup-historical-statistics-trends.aspx Presidential Approval Ratings – Gallup Historical Statistics and Trends], Gallup.com&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[Ivy League]] and prep school education led to warnings by advisors that his image was too "[[preppy]]" in 1980, which resulted in deliberate efforts in his 1988 campaign to shed the image, including meeting voters at factories and shopping malls, abandoning set speeches. Bush's campaign director [[Roger Ailes]] and others were concerned that Bush was seen as a "wimp." Bush put that image to rest when he displayed evident fury during an interview with [[Dan Rather]] on January 25, 1988.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;

His ability to gain broad international support for the [[Gulf War]] and the war's result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph,&lt;ref name="white house bio" /&gt; rousing bipartisan approval,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people-press.org/report/182/modest-bush-approval-rating-boost-at-wars-end |title=Modest Bush Approval Rating Boost at War's End: Summary of Findings – Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press |publisher=People-press.org |access-date=September 5, 2010|date=April 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; though his decision to withdraw without removing [[Saddam Hussein]] left mixed feelings, and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bush41/program/intro.html |work=American Experience |title=George H.

Although Bush became the first elected Republican president since Hoover in [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]] to lose a reelection bid (facing a 34% approval rating leading up to the 1992 election), the mood did not last.

In 1993, Bush was targeted in an assassination plot when he visited Kuwait to commemorate the coalition's victory over Iraq in the Gulf War. Kuwaiti authorities arrested 17 people who were allegedly involved in using a car bomb in an attempt to kill Bush. Through interviews with the suspects and examinations of the bomb's circuitry and wiring, the FBI established that the plot had been directed by the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]]. A Kuwaiti court later convicted all but one of the defendants. Two months later, Clinton retaliated when he ordered the [[1993 cruise missile strikes on Iraq|firing]] of 23 [[cruise missile]]s at Iraqi Intelligence Service headquarters in [[Baghdad]]. The day before the strike, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations [[Madeleine Albright]] went before the Security Council to present evidence of the Iraqi plot. After the missiles were fired, Vice President [[Al Gore]] said the attack "was intended to be a proportionate response at the place where this plot" to assassinate Bush "was hatched and implemented".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/longroad/etc/assassination.html |title=frontline: the long road to war: assassination |publisher=PBS |access-date=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1993, Bush and other living former presidents were invited back to the White House for an Arab-Israeli peace accord. They also made the case to Clinton for a repeal of [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush |first=Jon |last=Meacham |page=543 |year=2015 |isbn=978-1400067657 |publisher=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1994 gubernatorial elections, his sons George W. and Jeb concurrently ran for [[Governor of Texas]] and [[List of Governors of Florida|Governor of Florida]]. The elder Bush frequently telephoned campaign headquarters for updates on the race.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham, p. 549.&lt;/ref&gt; George W. won his race against [[Ann Richards]] while Jeb lost to [[Lawton Chiles]]. After the results came in, the elder Bush told ABC, "I have very mixed emotions.

In an October 22, 1994 speech in [[Cancún]], Mexico, Bush said history would vindicate him for not attempting to force Saddam Hussein out of power while in office: "The Mideast peace talks that offer hope to the world would never have started if we had done that.

[[File:G &amp; B. Bush F-SD-03-15575.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|George and Barbara Bush, 2001]]
His eldest son, [[George W. Bush]], was inaugurated as the 43rd president of the United States on January 20, 2001, and re-elected in 2004. Through previous administrations, the elder Bush had ubiquitously been known as "George Bush" or "President Bush", but following his son's election the need to distinguish between them has made [[retronym]]ic forms such as "George H. W. Bush" and "George Bush senior" and colloquialisms such as "Bush 41" and "Bush the Elder" much more common. H.W. Bush was traveling to [[Minnesota]] for a speaking engagement on the day of the [[September 11 attacks]]. George W. made multiple calls to get in contact with his father before the two men reconnected after the elder Bush had gone to a [[Brookfield, Wisconsin]] motel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=41: A Portrait of My Father |first=George W. |last=Bush |authorlink=George W.

In December 2002, George W. sought counsel from the elder Bush regarding Iraq and informed him of "my efforts to rally the Saudis, Jordanians, Turks, and others in the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;Meacham, pp. 571-572.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual misconduct allegations===
In October 2017, during the [[Me Too movement]], actress [[Heather Lind]] accused Bush of [[groping]] her and telling an inappropriate joke.

Bush suffered from vascular [[parkinsonism]], a form of [[Parkinson's disease]] that had forced him to use a motorized scooter or wheelchair since at least 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Photo P012712PS-0676 |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/6773105167/in/photostream/ |date=January 27, 2012 |publisher=The Whitehouse |access-date=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Updegrove |first1=Mark K. |title=An Exclusive Conversation with President and Mrs. Bush |url=https://parade.com/123684/markupdegrove/15-george-hw-bush-family-is-what-matters/ |access-date=February 15, 2017 |work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]] |date=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on November 30, 2018, aged 94,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Former President George H.W.

===Legacy===
According to ''USA Today'', the legacy of Bush's presidency was defined by his victory over Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait, and for his presiding over the collapse of the USSR and unification of Germany. The paper said his political legacy would "continue years later through his son, George W. Bush, who became the 43rd president of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remembering Former President George H.W.

Picht wrote that his decision to arrest and depose Panama Dictator [[Manuel Noriega]] was popular at the time, but will be less fondly remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Picht |first1=Matt |title=George H.W.

According to presidential historian [[Mark K.

He graduated from [[Saint Louis School|St. Louis High School]] on [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], about which he said, "I came to Honolulu to get educated. Instead I lost my innocence."  While at St. Louis, he studied under Hawaiian cultural expert John Kahauanu Lake, and achieved mastery in [[singing|vocal performance]] and [[guitar]].

==Overview==
Helm was one of the greatest Hawaiian [[falsetto]] vocalists, and played fast, complex guitar parts while singing in an "almost inhuman" vocal range. He was a powerful speaker, writer, and "revolutionary" philosopher who pioneered many [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement|Hawaiian sovereignty]] concepts. He was considered, as his posthumous album title suggests, a "True Hawaiian"&lt;ref name="hawaiianmusic.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiianmusic.net/george_helm.htm |title=The Music of George Helm - A True Hawaiian |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ClmDWrg3?url=http://www.hawaiianmusic.net/george_helm.htm |archivedate=December 9, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012 |asin=B003M7J054 |id={{OCLC|41616363|9058443}} |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; who surfed, fished, farmed, loved, sang, worshipped, and thought in the ways of old.&lt;ref name="Honolulu 100"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.honolulumagazine.com/core/pagetools.php?pageid=5136&amp;url=%2FHonolulu-Magazine%2FNovember-2005%2FThe-HONOLULU-100%2F&amp;mode=print |title=Honolulu Magazine &amp;#124; The HONOLULU 100 - George Helm Jr. to Eddie Kamae |publisher=PacificBasin Communications |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |work=[[Honolulu (magazine)|Honolulu]] |date=November 2005 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CiwyTDw5?url=http://www.honolulumagazine.com/core/pagetools.php?pageid%3D5136%26url%3D/Honolulu-Magazine/November-2005/The-HONOLULU-100/%26mode%3Dprint |deadurl=no |archivedate=December 7, 2012 |accessdate=December 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
[[File:GeorgeHelm.jpg|left|thumb|200px]]
George Helm began his front-line activism in the [[Molokai|Moloka{{okina}}i]]-based group [[Hui Alaloa]] around 1975, and became deeply involved in Protect Kaho{{okina}}olawe {{okina}}Ohana,&lt;ref name="Catherine Kekoa"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/96/03/19/features/story1.html |title=George Helm's soulful music helped solidify a movement |first=Catherine Kekoa |last=Enomoto  |newspaper=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |publisher=Oahu Publications Inc., a Subsidiary of [[Black Press]] Ltd. |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |date=March 19, 1996 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Hawaiian-led organization that sought to end the [[bombing]] of the island of [[Kahoolawe|Kaho{{okina}}olawe]], a Hawaiian island used as target practice by the U.S. Navy. In 1976, nine activists occupied the island of Kaho{{okina}}olawe, Helm among them. He was moved intensely by the power and beauty of the island, and dedicated the rest of his life to fighting for its protection.

Helm, stating "we were touched by some force that pushed us into commitment" (''Hawaii Observer'', 1976), appealed to the Hawaii State legislature&lt;ref name="House Resolution #493"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ilind.net/gallery_old/kahoolawe1976/source/reso1.htm |title=kahoolawe catalog &amp;#124; 76.78 |date=November 10, 2010 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}} {{cite web |url= http://www.ilind.net/gallery_old/kahoolawe1976/source/reso2.htm |title=kahoolawe catalog &amp;#124; 77.78 |date=November 10, 2010 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}} Pages 1 &amp; 2 of House Resolution # 493, House of Representatives, Eighth Legislature, 1976, State of Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt; and to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], where he proved to be a great writer and orator, for Kaho{{okina}}olawe's protection. However, the bombing continued. More Kaho{{okina}}olawe landings by protesters ensued, and on January 30, 1977 five [[activist]]s (Helm, Walter Ritte, Richard Sawyer, Charles Warrington, and Francis Ka{{okina}}uhane) landed on Kaho{{okina}}olawe in an attempt to gain greater public recognition of the struggle. Everyone was arrested except for Ritte and Sawyer, who stayed hidden on the island for 35&amp;nbsp;days, with very limited food and water.&lt;ref name="Na Mana'o Aloha o Kaho'olawe"&gt;{{cite book |title=Na Mana'o Aloha o Kaho'olawe: Hawai'i Warriors Love for Land and Culture |first1=Walter |last1=Ritte, Jr. |first2=Richard |last2=Sawyer |year=1978 |publisher=Aloha 'Aina o na Kupuna, Inc |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |oclc=8661294 |asin=B0006Y07P8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
Concerned for Walter Ritte and Richard Sawyer (bombing protesters who were in hiding on the deserted island of [[Kahoolawe|Kaho{{okina}}olawe]]), and beset by vivid dreams and visions, George Helm set out — first by boat, then by surfboard — to Kaho{{okina}}olawe, with Maui fisherman and park ranger Kimo Mitchell and water expert Billy Mitchell (unrelated). They reached the island, but Sawyer and Ritte had already been picked up. The next day, the boat belonging to Maxwell Han from Hana that was scheduled to meet Helm, Kimo Mitchell, and Billy Mitchell and return them to Maui was discovered swamped. Apparently someone had removed the plug out of the small Boston Whaler. Inexplicably, the three apparently decided to return to Maui. They had a long board, a short board and a pair of fins between them. The weather was extremely treacherous with high winds, small craft warnings, and pounding waves on the shoreline. On the entry to the water George Helm was injured with a gash to his head. Once they were in the water it was obvious to all of them that the currents and ocean conditions were going to prevent them from reaching Maui. They realized they were in a life-threatening situation. At this point Billy Mitchell took the long board and headed back to Kaho'olawe to get help. It took him a good part of the day to reach the shore and walk across the island to notify the Navy of the situation and to get the Coast Guard involved in a rescue operation. Helm and Kimo Mitchell were last seen near the tiny crescent-shaped islet of [[Molokini]] by Billy Mitchell, who was the only survivor of the group.&lt;ref name="Morales"&gt;{{cite book |title=HoʻiHoʻi Hou, a tribute to George Helm &amp; Kimo Mitchell |editor-last=Morales |editor-first=Rodney |editor-link=Rodney Morales |series=[[Bamboo Ridge|Bamboo Ridge : the Hawaii writers quarterly]] |volume=22 |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |publisher=Bamboo Ridge Press |isbn=9780910043083 |oclc=23139318 |date=January 1, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Today, George Helm is hailed as one of the [[Aloha ʻĀina]] movement's greatest heroes; among young activists he is as legendary as the great [[Eddie Aikau]] is to young surfers.&lt;ref name="TenBruggencate"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Legend of a hero |date=2008-03-16 |first=Jan |last=TenBruggencate |work=[[The Honolulu Advertiser]] |accessdate=December 14, 2012 |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Mar/16/ln/hawaii803160362.html |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |oclc=8807414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his only musical recordings were made with minimal technology in a local [[bar (establishment)|bar]], they are played regularly on all Hawaiian music stations.&lt;ref name="hawaiianmusic.net"/&gt; Generations later, George Helm's music is still inspirational to many, both because it is considered to be some of the finest examples of Hawaiian falsetto ever created, and because it embodies one of the most powerful expressions of the Hawaiian soul.&lt;ref name="Vance"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kingdomofhawaii.wordpress.com/2011/03/07/george-helm-a-hawaiian-legacy-by-kamuela-vance/|title=George Helm – A Hawaiian Legacy|last=Vance|first=Kamuela|date=2011-03-07|work=Kingdom of Hawaii|accessdate=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular song, "Hawaiian Soul," by Jon Osorio and Randy Borden, was written in his memory.&lt;ref name="Cord International"&gt;{{Cite web|title=A Place Called Hawaii |at=10.

==Quotes==
"We are in a 'revolution of consciousness' .... What we (are) looking for is the truth."&lt;ref name="Akaka bill"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Feb/22/op/op08a.html/?print=on |title=Commentary: Akaka bill doesn't right wrongs done to Hawaiians |work=[[The Honolulu Advertiser]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |first1=Kunani |last1=Nihipali |first2=Ho'oipo Kalaena'auao |last2=Pa |first3=Pu'uhonua "Bumpy" |last3=Kanahele |date=February 22, 2004 |oclc=8807414 |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"There is man and there is environment. One does not
supersede the other. The breath in man is the breath of Papa. Man is merely the caretaker of the land that maintains his life and nourishes his soul. Therefore, the [[Aloha Aina|{{okina}}āina]] is sacred.

'''George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence''' (21 October 1449{{snd}}18 February 1478), [[Order of the Garter|KG]], was the third surviving son of [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]], and [[Cecily Neville]], and the brother of [[Kingdom of England|English]] Kings [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]. He played an important role in the dynastic struggle between rival factions of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenets]] known as the [[Wars of the Roses]].

Though a member of the [[House of York]], he switched sides to support the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]], before reverting to the Yorkists. He was later convicted of treason against his brother, Edward IV, and was executed (allegedly by being drowned in a [[Butt (unit)|butt]] of [[Malvasia|Malmsey]] wine). He appears as a character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', in which his death is attributed to the machinations of Richard.

==Life==
George was born on 21 October 1449 in [[Dublin]] at a time when his father, the Duke of York, had begun to challenge [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] for the crown. His godfather was [[James FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond]]. He was the third of the four sons of Richard and Cecily who survived to adulthood. His father died in 1460. In 1461 his elder brother, Edward, became King of England as Edward IV. In that year George was made [[Duke of Clarence]] and invested as a [[Knight of the Garter]], and in 1462 Clarence received the [[Honour of Richmond]], a lifetime grant, but without the [[peerage]] title of [[Earl of Richmond]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Despite his youth, he was appointed as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] in the same year.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Clarence, Dukes of |display=Clarence, Dukes of s.v. George, duke of Clarence |volume=6|page=428}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Richard Neville.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]]
[[File:Isabelle of Neville.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Isabelle Neville]]

Having been mentioned as a possible husband for [[Mary of Burgundy|Mary]], daughter of [[Charles the Bold]], Clarence came under the influence of his first cousin [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]], and in July 1469 was married in [[Église Notre-Dame de Calais]] to the earl's elder daughter [[Isabel Neville|Isabel]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Clarence had actively supported his elder brother's claim to the throne, but when his father-in-law (known as "the Kingmaker") deserted Edward IV to ally with [[Margaret of Anjou]], consort of the deposed King Henry, Clarence supported him and was deprived of his office as Lord Lieutenant.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Clarence joined Warwick in [[France]], taking his pregnant wife. She gave birth to their first child, a girl, on 16 April 1470, in a ship off [[Calais]]. The child died shortly afterwards. Henry VI rewarded Clarence by making him next in line to the throne after [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|his own son]], justifying the exclusion of Edward IV either by [[attainder]] for his treason against Henry VI or on the grounds of his [[Edward IV of England#Was Edward illegitimate?|alleged illegitimacy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
After a short time, Clarence realized that his loyalty to his father-in-law was misplaced: Warwick had his younger daughter, [[Anne Neville]], Clarence's sister-in-law, marry Henry VI's son in December 1470. This demonstrated that his father-in-law was less interested in making him king than in serving his own interests and, since it now seemed unlikely that Warwick would replace Edward IV with Clarence, Clarence was secretly reconciled with Edward.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Warwick's efforts to keep Henry VI on the throne ultimately failed and Warwick was killed in battle of Barnet April 1471. The re-instated King Edward IV restored his brother Clarence to royal favour by making him Great Chamberlain of England. As his father-in-law had died, Clarence became ''[[jure uxoris]]'' Earl of Warwick, but did not inherit the entire Warwick estate as his younger brother, [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], had married ({{circa|1472}}) Anne Neville, who had been widowed in 1471. Edward intervened and eventually divided the estates between his brothers.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Clarence was created first Earl of Warwick on 25 March 1472.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Weir, ''Britain's Royal Family: A Complete Genealogy'' (London, U.K.: The Bodley Head, 1999), page 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1475 Clarence's wife Isabel gave birth to a son, [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick|Edward]], later [[Earl of Warwick]]. Isabel died on 22 December 1476, two months after giving birth to a short-lived son named Richard (6 October 1476{{snd}}1 January 1477), and they are buried together at [[Tewkesbury Abbey]] in [[Gloucestershire (traditional)|Gloucestershire]]. Their surviving children, [[Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury|Margaret]] and [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick|Edward]], were cared for by their aunt, [[Anne Neville]], until she died in 1485, when Edward was 10 years old.

==Death==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--3 paragraphs are not cited--&gt;
Though most historians now believe Isabel's death was a result of either consumption or [[childbed fever]], Clarence was convinced she had been poisoned by one of her ladies-in-waiting, [[Isabel Neville#Death|Ankarette Twynyho]], whom, as a consequence, he had judicially murdered in April 1477, by summarily arresting her and bullying a jury at Warwick into convicting her of murder by poisoning.  She was hanged immediately after trial with John Thursby, a fellow defendant. She was posthumously pardoned in 1478 by King Edward. Clarence's mental state, never stable, deteriorated from that point and led to his involvement in yet another rebellion against his brother Edward.

In 1477 Clarence was again a suitor for the hand of Mary, who had just become [[List of Burgundian consorts|duchess of Burgundy]]. Edward objected to the match, and Clarence left the court.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The arrest and committal to the [[Tower of London]] of one of Clarence's retainers, an Oxford astronomer named Dr John Stacey, led to his confession under torture that he had "imagined and compassed" the death of the King, and used the black arts to accomplish this.  He implicated one Thomas Burdett, and one Thomas Blake, a chaplain at Stacey's college ([[Merton College, Oxford]]).
All three were tried for treason, convicted, and condemned to be drawn to [[Tyburn]] and hanged.  Blake was saved at the eleventh hour by a plea for his life from [[James Goldwell]], Bishop of Norwich, but the other two were put to death as ordered.

This was a clear warning to Clarence, which he chose to ignore. He appointed Dr John Goddard to burst into Parliament and regale the House with Burdett and Stacey's declarations of innocence that they had made before their deaths.  Goddard was a very unwise choice, as he was an ex-Lancastrian who had expounded Henry VI's claim to the throne. Edward summoned Clarence to Windsor, severely upbraided him, accused him of treason, and ordered his immediate arrest and confinement.

Clarence was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] and put on trial for treason against his brother Edward IV. Clarence was not present – Edward himself prosecuted his brother, and demanded that Parliament pass a [[Bill of Attainder]] against his brother, declaring that he was guilty of "unnatural, loathly treasons" which were aggravated by the fact that Clarence was his brother, who, if anyone did, owed him loyalty and love.  Following his conviction, he was "privately executed" at the Tower on 18 February 1478, by tradition in the Bowyer Tower, and soon after the event, the rumour gained ground that he had been [[List of unusual deaths|drowned]] in a [[Butt (unit)|butt]] of [[Malvasia|Malmsey]] wine.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Richard III biographer Paul Murray Kendall believes that the reason that Edward was so harsh with his brother is because he had discovered from Bishop [[Robert Stillington]] of Bath and Wells, that George had let slip the secret of Edward's pre-contract marriage with [[Lady Eleanor Talbot]].&lt;ref&gt;Kendall pp.259–260&lt;/ref&gt; Although legend claims Richard III had brought about his brother's death, the opposite is true—he tried to prevent it.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall pp.147–149&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Shakespeare==

Clarence is a principal character in two of [[William Shakespeare]]'s history plays: ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'' and ''[[The Tragedy of Richard III]].'' Shakespeare portrays Clarence as weak-willed and changeable, his initial defection from [[Edward IV]] to Warwick is prompted by outrage at Edward IV's unwise marriage to [[Elizabeth Woodville]]. Despite several flowery speeches proclaiming loyalty to Warwick and to Henry VI, Clarence defects back to Edward IV's side almost as soon as he sees his brothers again; it takes only a few lines for his brothers to shame him into rejoining the Yorkist party. Several lines reference his penchant for wine.

In ''Richard III'', the play opens with Gloucester having framed Clarence for treason, using a soothsayer to sow doubt in the King's mind about his brother, and in the first scene Clarence is arrested and taken to the Tower. Gloucester nimbly stage-manages Clarence's death, fast-tracking the order of execution and then intercepting Edward IV's pardon when he changes his mind. In Act One Scene Four, Clarence recounts a terrifying nightmare, in which he has been pushed (accidentally) into the ocean by Gloucester and drowns, then finds himself in hell, accused of perjury by the ghosts of Warwick and Prince Edward. When he is attacked by assassins sent by Gloucester, he pleads eloquently and nobly but is stabbed and drowned in a butt of wine. It is Clarence's death that sends Edward IV into a fatal attack of guilt. Clarence is the first character to die in the play and his ghost later appears to Gloucester, then already Richard III, and Henry Tudor, the future [[Henry VII of England]], before the Battle of Bosworth Field, cursing his brother and encouraging Henry.

==Children==
Clarence married his wife [[Isabel Neville]] in [[Calais]], at that time controlled by [[Kingdom of England|England]], on 11 July 1469. Together they had four children:{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}
* Anne of York ({{circa|lk=no|17 April 1470)}}, born and died in a ship off Calais.
* [[Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury]] (14 August 1473{{snd}}27 May 1541); married [[Sir Richard Pole]]; executed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Ancestress of Major [[Wulstan Tempest]] D.S.O.
* [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick]] (25 February 1475{{snd}}28 November 1499); the last legitimate Plantagenet heir of the direct male line; executed by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] on grounds of attempting to escape from the [[Tower of London]].
* Richard of York (6 October 1476{{snd}}1 January 1477); born at [[Tewkesbury Abbey]], [[Tewkesbury]], [[Gloucestershire]]; died at [[Warwick Castle]], [[Warwick]], [[Warwickshire]], where he was buried.

'''Harold Richman''' (15 May 1937 – 30 July 2009) was the founding director of [[Chapin Hall Center for Children]], a policy research center at the University of Chicago known for pioneering methods of collecting, linking, and analyzing administrative data from public agencies to help monitor outcomes of children and youth and their families involved in U. S. public programs. He was Hermon Dunlap Smith Professor Emeritus of Social Welfare Policy at the [[University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration]] and the College.

==Education==
At age 22, Harold Richman received an A.B in American History and Literature from [[Harvard College]], Cambridge, [[Massachusetts]]. He continued his studies at the [[University of Chicago]], Chicago, Illinois, where he received his M.A. in [[Social Welfare]] Policy in 1961 and his PhD in 1969.

==Employment==
After two years as Associate Professor, Harold Richman became Dean and Professor of the School of Social Service Administration. He served as Dean of the SSA from 1969 to 1978.

In 1985, Harold Richman guided the board of Chapin Hall, a residential home created during the [[American Civil War]] to care for “half orphans," in redefining its mission. Mr. Richman established Chapin Hall as a university-based research center that conducted research with the express purpose of informing [[child welfare]] policy and practice. He helped to shape a field of research around the array of activities and resources needed by all young people to thrive physically, socially, and academically. Professor Richman also led work at Chapin Hall to document and evaluate community-building initiatives and the role [[philanthropy]] plays in those efforts.

Harold Richman stepped down as director of Chapin Hall in 2000, but continued as a research fellow and advised research centers in several countries including [[South Africa]], Ireland, [[Jordan]], and Israel.

==Leading and Reforming, for the sake of vulnerable children==
Harold Richman provided public policy leadership throughout the world:
* He sat on boards of major public institutions (service agencies, public policy institutes) and foundations, several of which he helped create. This included the John Gardner Center at Stanford University; the Children’s Institute at the University of Cape Town;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.org.za|Children’s Institute at the University of Cape Town]&lt;/ref&gt; the Information and Research Center in Amman, Jordan;  The Engelberg Center for Children and Youth at the [[Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute]] in Jerusalem, and the Center for the Study of Social Policy in Washington D.C.
* He sat on the boards of a number of foundations (SEED Foundation in Washington D.C., Michael Reese Health Trust, Chicago, IL, MB Fund, Chicago, IL) and civic groups (Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Interfaith Youth Core,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifyc.org/about_core/board "Interfaith Youth Core, Board of Directors"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019121924/http://www.ifyc.org/about_core/board |date=2009-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental Disability Rights International, Afterschool Matters, Chicago, IL).
* He led a Committee on Public Policy Studies at the University of Chicago. The Committee has since evolved into the internationally respected Irving B. Harris School of Public Policy Studies, a graduate professional school at the University of Chicago.
* He established Chapin Hall as a policy research center at the University of Chicago to inform child-family policy.
* Under his leadership, the School of Social of Administration became a leading institution in the field of social welfare policy and administration.
* He was the first chairman and served on the board of The University of Chicago's Laboratory Schools (the preK–12 school founded by John Dewey), the council of the College, and the Social Service Review.
* He was a member of the Governing Board of the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebulletin.org/content/media-center/announcements/2009/07/31/harold-richman-bulletin-board-member-1937-2009 "Harold Richman Bulletin board member, 1937-2009"]&lt;/ref&gt;

He advised colleagues, government officials, and philanthropists on countless policy issues, as well as small neighborhood groups helping highly vulnerable communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Between Help and a Hard Place | publisher = [http://magazine.uchicago.edu "The University of Chicago Magazine"] | date = June 1995 | url = http://magazine.uchicago.edu/9506/June95Coursework.html | accessdate = 2006-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hague, The Netherlands, Mouton &amp; Co., p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Following the transfer of sovereignty on December 27, 1949, Agung served as a member of the short-lived [[Republic of the United States of Indonesia Cabinet|RUSI Cabinet]] where he served as Minister of the Interior.&lt;ref name="Anak Agung gde Agung"/&gt; Due to his Federalist sympathies, he politically feuded with [[Sukarno]] who advocated a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[Republic of Indonesia]]. Following the abolition of the federal system in 1950, he served as the Indonesian [[Ambassador]] to [[Belgium]],&lt;ref name="Westerling167" /&gt; followed by successive appointments as Ambassador to Luxembourg, Portugal, France and Austria. During the Sukarno presidency, Agung served as Indonesia's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Indonesia)|Foreign Minister]] between 1955 and 1956, and was a participant in the [[West New Guinea dispute]]. Later, he was imprisoned by the Sukarno regime between 1962 and 1966 but was never brought to trial.&lt;ref name=" Anak Agung gde Agung" /&gt;

Following the [[30 September Movement|1965 attempted coup]] and rise of [[Suharto]]'s [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] regime, Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung was released by the new [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Indonesia)|Indonesian Foreign Minister]] [[Adam Malik]], who also restored him to his senior position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During the New Order era, Agung served as Indonesia's Ambassador to Austria. During his time overseas, Agung also authored ''Twenty years Indonesian foreign policy 1945-1965'', a 660-page history of Indonesian foreign policy during the Sukarno era. In his book, Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung argued that Indonesian foreign policy was based on the principles of independence and action, which meant remaining independent of foreign powers. Agung also argued that Sukarno abandoned Indonesia's independent foreign policy by aligning Indonesia with China and embarking on a [[Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation|policy of Confrontation]] against Malaysia.&lt;ref name=" Anak Agung gde Agung" /&gt; Agung died in 1999 and he was named a National Hero of the Republic of Indonesia in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/vicindonblog/2007/11/the_ide_anak_agung_agung_gde_a.html|title=The Ide Anak Agung Agung Gde Agung controversy |author= [[Adrian Vickers]] |work=Indonesia blog|publisher=[[University of Sydney]] |accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irenaeus''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪr|ɪ|ˈ|n|eɪ|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;[[James L. Papandrea]] – [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hH4g-Thmg0 "The First Theologians: Irenaeus and Tertullian"]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|Εἰρηναῖος}} ''Eirēnaios''; c. 140 – c. 202 AD)&lt;ref&gt;''The Faith of the Early Fathers'', Liturgical Press, 1970, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Greece|Greek]] cleric noted for his role in guiding and expanding [[Christian]] communities in what is now the south of [[France]] and, more widely, for the development of [[Christian theology]] by combatting [[heresy]] and defining [[orthodoxy]]. Originating from [[Smyrna]], now [[Izmir]] in [[Turkey]], he had heard the preaching of [[Polycarp]],&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius of Caesarea, ''Ecclesiastical History'' Book v. Chapter v.&lt;/ref&gt; who in turn was said to have heard [[John the Evangelist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/irenaeus-saint A. Poncelet, "Irenaeus, Saint" Catholic Encyclopedia 1917 (Catholic Answers)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chosen as [[bishop of Lugdunum]], now [[Lyon]], his best-known work is ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis]]'', often cited as ''Adversus Haereses'', an attack on [[gnosticism]], in particular that of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]].&lt;ref name ="Oxford"&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; To counter the doctrines of the gnostic sects claiming secret wisdom, he offered three pillars of orthodoxy: the [[Bible|scripture]]s, the [[Apostolic Tradition|tradition]] handed down from the [[apostles]], and the teaching of the apostles' [[Apostolic succession|successors]].&lt;ref&gt;"Caesar and Christ"(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9042757/Saint-Irenaeus|title=Encyclopædia Britannica: Saint Irenaeus|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intrinsic to his writing is that the surest source of Christian guidance is the church of [[Papal primacy|Rome]],&lt;ref name ="Oxford"/&gt; and he is the earliest surviving witness to recognise all four [[gospel]]s as essential.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;[[Raymond E. Brown|Brown, Raymond E.]] ''An Introduction to the New Testament'', p. 14. [[Anchor Bible]]; 1st edition (October 13, 1997). {{ISBN|978-0-385-24767-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is recognized as a [[saint]] in the [[Catholic Church]] on 28 June,&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church on 23 August.

==Biography==
[[File:Saint irenee saint irenee.jpg|thumb|right|Irenaus, in Church of St Irenaeus, Lyon.]]Irenaeus was born during the first half of the [[2nd century]] (the exact date is disputed: probably between the years 120 and 140),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Irenaeus Saint Irenaeus – Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and he is thought to have been a [[Greek people|Greek]] from [[Polycarp]]'s hometown of [[Smyrna]] in [[Asia Minor]], now [[İzmir]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus himself tells us (''Against Heresies'' 3.3.4, cf [[Eusebius]] ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' 5.20.5ff) that in his 'youth' he saw [[Polycarp of Smyrna|Polycarp]], the [[Bishop of Smyrna]] who was martyred c156. This is the evidence used to assume that Irenaeus was born in Smyrna during the 130s–140s.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many of his contemporaries, he was brought up in a [[Christian]] family rather than converting as an adult.

During the persecution of [[Marcus Aurelius]], the [[Roman Emperor]] from 161–180, Irenaeus was a priest of the Church of Lyon. The clergy of that city, many of whom were suffering imprisonment for the faith, sent him in 177 to Rome with a letter to [[Pope Eleutherius]] concerning the heresy [[Montanism]], and that occasion bore emphatic testimony to his merits. While Irenaeus was in Rome, a persecution took place in Lyon. Returning to Gaul, Irenaeus succeeded the [[martyr]] [[Saint Pothinus]] and became the second [[Bishop of Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5.4.1&lt;/ref&gt;

During the religious peace which followed the persecution of Marcus Aurelius, the new bishop divided his activities between the duties of a pastor and of a missionary (as to which we have but brief data, late and not very certain). Almost all his writings were directed against Gnosticism. The most famous of these writings is ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' (''Against Heresies''). Irenaeus alludes to coming across Gnostic writings, and holding conversations with Gnostics, and this may have taken place in Asia Minor or in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', 1.pr.2, 4.pr.2&lt;/ref&gt; However, it also appears that Gnosticism was present near Lyon: he writes that there were followers of '[[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus the Magician]]' living and teaching in the [[Rhone valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Against Heresies 1.13.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the career of Irenaeus after he became bishop. The last action reported of him (by [[Eusebius]], 150 years later) is that in 190 or 191, he exerted influence on [[Pope Victor I]] not to excommunicate the Christian communities of Asia Minor which persevered in the practice of the [[Quartodeciman]] celebration of [[Easter]].&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5.24.1ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing is known of the date of his death, which must have occurred at the end of the 2nd or the beginning of the 3rd century. A few within the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Church celebrate him as a martyr.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory of Tours]] is the first to mention a tradition which held Irenaeus to be a martyr&lt;/ref&gt;  He was buried under the Church of Saint John in Lyon, which was later renamed St Irenaeus in his honour. The tomb and his remains were utterly destroyed in 1562 by the [[Huguenots]].

==Writings==
Irenaeus wrote a number of books, but the most important that survives is the ''Against Heresies'' (or, in its [[Latin language|Latin]] title, ''Adversus haereses'').  In Book I, Irenaeus talks about the Valentinian Gnostics and their predecessors, who he says go as far back as the magician [[Simon Magus]].  In Book II he attempts to provide proof that [[Valentinianism]] contains no merit in terms of its doctrines.  In Book III Irenaeus purports to show that these doctrines are false, by providing counter-evidence gleaned from the [[Gospel]]s.  Book IV consists of Jesus' sayings, and here Irenaeus also stresses the unity of the Old Testament and the Gospel.  In the final volume, Book V, Irenaeus focuses on more sayings of Jesus plus the letters of [[Paul the Apostle]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Robert M., ''Irenaeus of Lyons'', p. 6. Routledge 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:POxy405.jpg|thumb|right|Cambridge University library manuscript 4113 / Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 405.  Irenaeus. Ca. 200 AD.]]The purpose of "Against Heresies" was to refute the teachings of various Gnostic groups; apparently, several Greek merchants had begun an oratorial campaign in Irenaeus' bishopric, teaching that the material world was the accidental creation of an evil god, from which we are to escape by the pursuit of ''gnosis''.  Irenaeus argued that the true gnosis is in fact knowledge of Christ, which redeems rather than escapes from bodily existence.&lt;ref&gt;source needed&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the discovery of the [[Nag Hammadi library|Library of Nag Hammadi]] in 1945, ''Against Heresies'' was the best-surviving description of Gnosticism. Some religious scholars have argued the findings at Nag Hammadi have shown Irenaeus' description of Gnosticism to be inaccurate and polemic in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Pagels, Elaine. ''Beyond Belief'', Pan Books, 2005. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the general consensus among modern scholars is that Irenaeus was fairly accurate in his transmission of Gnostic beliefs, and that the Nag Hammadi texts have raised no substantial challenges to the overall accuracy of Irenaeus' information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orthodoxy and Heresy in Early Christian Contexts: Reconsidering the Bauer Thesis|last=Hartog|first=Paul A.|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|year=2015|isbn=978-1-61097-504-9|location=Eugene, Oregon|pages=199, 200}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Religious historian Elaine Pagels criticizes Irenaeus for describing Gnostic groups as sexual libertines, for example, when some of their own writings advocated chastity more strongly than did orthodox texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gnostc Gospels|last=Pagels|first=Elaine|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Nag Hammadi texts do not present a single, coherent picture of any unified Gnostc system of belief, but rather divergent beliefs of multiple Gnostic sects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lost Christianities|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-518249-1|location=Oxford|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these sects were indeed libertine because they considered bodily existence meaningless; others praised chastity, and strongly prohibited any sexual activity, even within marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney. ''Cities of God'', HarperCollins, 2007. chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  

Irenaeus also wrote ''The Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching'' (also known as ''Proof of the Apostolic Preaching''), an [[Armenian language|Armenian]] copy of which was discovered in 1904. This work seems to have been an instruction for recent Christian converts.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntcanon.org/Irenaeus.shtml|title=The Development of the Canon of the New Testament – Irenaeus|publisher=Ntcanon.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This work was first published in 1907 in Armenian, along with a German translation by Adolf von Harnack. It is Harnack who divided the text into one hundred numbered sections.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eusebius attests to other works by Irenaeus, today lost, including ''On the Ogdoad,'' an untitled letter to Blastus regarding schism,  ''On the Subject of Knowledge'', ''On the Monarchy'' or ''How God is not the Cause of Evil'', ''On Easter''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08130b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Irenaeus|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rev.

''[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/tixeront/section1-4.html#irenaeus Section IV: The Opponents of Heresy in the Second Century]'', St. Louis, MO, by B. Herder Book Co. 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5.20.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ireneaus|last1=of Lyon|title=VII. Fragments from the Lost Writings of Irenaeus|page=569|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irenaeus exercised wide influence on the generation which followed. Both [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] and [[Tertullian]] freely drew on his writings. However, none of his works aside from ''Against Heresies'' and ''The Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching'' survive today, perhaps because his literal hope of an earthly [[Chiliasm|millennium]] may have made him uncongenial reading in the [[Greek East]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Chadwick, ''The Early Church'', Penguin Group, 1993&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Even though no complete version of ''Against Heresies'' in its original Greek exists, we possess the full ancient Latin version, probably of the third century, as well as thirty-three fragments of a Syrian version and a complete Armenian version of books 4 and 5.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A Norris, Jr, 'Irenaeus of Lyons', in Frances Young, Lewis Ayres and Andrew Louth, eds, ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', (2010), p47&lt;/ref&gt;

Irenaeus' works were first translated into English by [[John Keble]] and published in 1872 as part of the [[Library of the Fathers]] series.

Irenaeus pointed to the public [[rule of faith]], authoritatively articulated by the preaching of bishops and inculcated in Church practice, especially worship, as an authentic apostolic tradition by which to read Scripture truly against heresies. He classified as Scripture not only the Old Testament but most of the books now known as the New Testament,&lt;ref name ="Oxford"/&gt; while excluding many works, a large number by Gnostics, that flourished in the 2nd century and claimed scriptural authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-3559/Saint-Irenaeus|title=Encyclopædia Britannica: Saint Irenaeus|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, Irenaeus, as a student of Polycarp, who was a direct disciple of the Apostle John, believed that he was interpreting scriptures in the same hermeneutic as the Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Hugh|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Saints|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-280058-2|page=250|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This connection to Christ was important to Irenaeus because both he and the Gnostics based their arguments on Scripture.  Irenaeus argued that since he could trace his authority to Christ and the Gnostics could not, his interpretation of Scripture was correct.&lt;ref&gt;J.T. Nielsen, ''Adam and Christ in the Theology of Irenaeus of Lyons: An Examination of the function of the Adam-Christ Typology in the'' Adversus Haereses ''of Ireaneus, against the Background of the Gnosticism of His Time''. Van Gorcum's Theologische Bibliotheek. (Asen, The Netherlands: Koninkliijke Van Gorcum 7 Comp. N.V., 1968), p. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also used "the Rule of Faith",&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.4.2. and IV.33.7.&lt;/ref&gt; a "proto-creed" with similarities to the [[Apostles' Creed]], as a hermeneutical key to argue that his interpretation of Scripture was correct.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Parvis, "Who was Irenaeus? An Introduction to the Man and His Work," in ''Irenaeus: Life, Scripture, Legacy, ed. Sara Parvis and Paul Foster (Minneanpolis: Fortress Press, 2012), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Irenaeus, Christians differed as to which gospel they preferred. The Christians of Asia Minor preferred the Gospel of John. The Gospel of Matthew was the most popular overall.&lt;ref name ="Harris"&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]],'' Understanding the Bible'' (Palo Alto: Mayfield, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus asserted that four Gospels, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]], were canonical scripture.&lt;ref&gt;"But it is not possible that the Gospels can be either more or fewer in number than they are. For since there are four zones of the world in which we live, and four principal winds, while the church has been scattered throughout the world, and since the 'pillar and ground' of the Church is the Gospel and the spirit of life, it is fitting that she should have four pillars, breathing incorruption on every side, and vivifying human afresh. From this fact, it is evident that the Logos, the fashioner ''[[demiurge|demiourgos]]'' of all, he that sits on the cherubim and holds all things together, when he was manifested to humanity, gave us the gospel under four forms but bound together by one spirit." Against Heresies 3.11.8&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Irenaeus provides the earliest witness to the assertion of the four canonical Gospels, possibly in reaction to [[Marcion]]'s edited version of the Gospel of Luke, which Marcion asserted was the one and only true gospel.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;

Based on the arguments Irenaeus made in support of only four authentic gospels, some interpreters deduce that the ''fourfold Gospel'' must have still been a novelty in Irenaeus' time.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Sanders, ''The Canon Debate'', 2002, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; ''Against Heresies'' 3.11.7 acknowledges that many heterodox Christians use only one gospel while 3.11.9 acknowledges that some use more than four.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Sanders, p. 280. Also p. 310, summarizing 3.11.7: the [[Ebionites]] use Matthew's Gospel, Marcion mutilates Luke's, the [[Docetist]]s use Mark's, the [[Valentinians]] use John's&lt;/ref&gt; The success of [[Tatian]]'s [[Diatessaron]] in about the same time period is "... a powerful indication that the fourfold Gospel contemporaneously sponsored by Irenaeus was not broadly, let alone universally, recognized."&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Sanders, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; (The apologist and ascetic Tatian had previously harmonized the four gospels into a single narrative, the ''Diatesseron'' circa 150–160)

Irenaeus is also the earliest attestation that the Gospel of John was written by [[John the Apostle]],&lt;ref name=p368&gt;McDonald &amp; Sanders, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Gospel of Luke was written by [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke, the companion of Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Sanders, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars{{Specify|date=July 2008}} contend that Irenaeus quotes from 21 of the 27 New Testament Texts:

Matthew (''Book 3, Chapter 16'')&lt;br /&gt;
Mark (''Book 3, Chapter 10'')&lt;br /&gt;
Luke (''Book 3, Chapter 14'')&lt;br /&gt;

He may refer to Hebrews (''Book 2, Chapter 30'') and James (''Book 4, Chapter 16'') and maybe even 2 Peter (''Book 5, Chapter 28'') but does not cite Philemon, 3 John or Jude.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Irenaeus cited the New Testament approximately 1000 times.  About one third of his citations are made to Paul's letters.  Irenaeus considered all 13 letters belonging to the Pauline corpus to have been written by Paul himself.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Ben C. ''Christosis: Pauline Soteriology in Light of Deification in Irenaeus and Cyril of Alexandria'' (Tübingen, Germany: Mohr Siebeck, 2011), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apostolic authority==
Irenaeus is also known as one of the first theologians to use the principle of [[apostolic succession]] to refute his opponents.&lt;ref name=oca&gt;[https://oca.org/saints/lives/2007/08/23/102379-hieromartyr-irenaeus-the-bishop-of-lyons "Hieromartyr Irenaeus the Bishop of Lyons", Orthodox Church in America"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his writing against the Gnostics, who claimed to possess a secret oral tradition from Jesus himself, Irenaeus maintained that the bishops in different cities are known as far back as the Apostles and that the bishops provided the only safe guide to the interpretation of Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;"Wherefore we must obey the priests of the Church who have succession from the Apostles, as we have shown, who, together with succession in the episcopate, have received the certain mark of truth according to the will of the Father; all others, however, are to be suspected, who separated themselves from the principal succession." Adversus Haereses (Book IV, Chapter 26). [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103426.htm read online].&lt;/ref&gt; In a passage that became a ''locus classicus'' of Catholic-Protestant polemics, he cited the Roman church as an example of the unbroken chain of authority which text Western polemics would use to assert the primacy of Rome over Eastern churches by virtue of its ''preeminent authority''.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-3559/Saint-Irenaeus|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Since, however, it would be very tedious, in such a volume as this, to reckon up the successions of all the Churches, we do put to confusion all those who, in whatever manner, whether by an evil self-pleasing, by vainglory, or by blindness and perverse opinion, assemble in unauthorized meetings; [we do this, I say,] by indicating that tradition derived from the apostles, of the very great, the very ancient, and universally known Church founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul; as also [by pointing out] the faith preached to men, which comes down to our time by means of the successions of the bishops. For it is a matter of necessity that every Church should agree with this Church, on account of its pre- eminent authority, that is, the faithful everywhere, inasmuch as the apostolical tradition has been preserved continuously by those [faithful men] who exist everywhere."[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103303.htm read online Adversus Haereses (Book III, Chapter 3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the lists of bishops to which Irenaeus referred, the doctrine of the apostolic succession, firmly established in the Church at this time, of the bishops could be linked.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt; This succession was important to establish a chain of custody for orthodoxy.  He felt it important, however, also to speak of a succession of elders (presbyters).&lt;ref&gt;''Against Heresies'', IV.26.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irenaeus' point when refuting the Gnostics was that all of the Apostolic churches had preserved the same traditions and teachings in many independent streams. It was the unanimous agreement between these many independent streams of transmission that proved the orthodox Faith, current in those churches, to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103433.htm|title=Adversus Haereses (Book IV, Chapter 33:8)|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irenaeus' theology and contrast with Gnosticism==
The central point of Irenaeus' [[theology]] is the unity and the goodness of [[God]], in opposition to the Gnostics' theory of God; a number of divine emanations [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|(Aeons)]] along with a distinction between the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]] and the [[Demiurge]]. Irenaeus uses the [[Logos]] theology he inherited from [[Justin Martyr]]. Irenaeus was a student of [[Polycarp]], who was said to have been tutored by [[John the Apostle]].&lt;ref name=p368 /&gt; (John had used Logos terminology in the [[Gospel of John]] and the letter of [[1 John]]). Irenaeus prefers to speak of the Son and the Spirit as the "hands of God".

=== The Unity of Salvation History ===
Irenaeus' emphasis on the unity of God is reflected in his corresponding emphasis on the unity of [[salvation]] history. Irenaeus repeatedly insists that God began the world and has been overseeing it ever since this creative act; everything that has happened is part of his plan for humanity. The essence of this plan is a process of maturation: Irenaeus believes that humanity was created immature, and God intended his creatures to take a long time to grow into or assume the divine likeness.

Everything that has happened since has therefore been planned by God to help humanity overcome this initial mishap and achieve spiritual maturity. The world has been intentionally designed by God as a difficult place, where human beings are forced to make moral decisions, as only in this way can they mature as moral agents. Irenaeus likens death to the big fish that swallowed [[Jonah]]: it was only in the depths of the whale's belly that Jonah could turn to God and act according to the divine will. Similarly, death and suffering appear as [[evil]]s, but without them we could never come to know God.

According to Irenaeus, the high point in salvation history is the advent of [[Jesus]]. For Irenaeus, the Incarnation of [[Christ]] was intended by God before He determined that humanity would be created.  Irenaeus develops this idea based on [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A14&amp;version=NRSVCE Rom. 5:14], saying "Forinasmuch as He had a pre-existence as a saving Being, it was necessary that what might be saved should also be called into existence, in order that the Being who saves should not exist in vain."&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.22.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Some theologians maintain that Irenaeus believed that Incarnation would have occurred even if humanity had never sinned; but the fact that they did [[sin]] determined his role as the [[wiktionary:savior|savior]].&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Carol, ''Why Jesus Christ?: Thomistic, Scotistic, and Conciliatory Perspectives'' (Manassas, VA: Trinity Communications, 1986), p. 172-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irenaeus sees Christ as the new Adam, who systematically ''undoes'' what Adam did: thus, where Adam was disobedient concerning God's edict concerning the fruit of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], Christ was obedient even to death on the wood of a tree. Irenaeus is the first to draw comparisons between [[Eve]] and [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]], contrasting the faithlessness of the former with the faithfulness of the latter. In addition to reversing the wrongs done by Adam, Irenaeus thinks of Christ as "recapitulating" or "summing up" human life.&lt;ref&gt;AH 3.18.7; 3.21.9–10; 3.22.3; 5.21.1; see also, Klager, Andrew P. "Retaining and Reclaiming the Divine: Identification and the Recapitulation of Peace in St. Irenaeus of Lyons' Atonement Narrative," ''Stricken by God? Nonviolent Identification and the Victory of Christ'', eds. Brad Jersak and Michael Hardin. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2007), esp. p. 462 n. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irenaeus conceives of our salvation as essentially coming about through the [[incarnation]] of God as a man. He characterizes the penalty for sin as death and [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]]. God, however, is [[Immortality|immortal]] and incorruptible, and simply by becoming united to human nature in Christ he conveys those qualities to us: they spread, as it were, like a benign infection.&lt;ref&gt;M David Litwa, "The Wondrous Exchange: Irenaeus and Eastern Valentinians on the Soteriology of Interchange," ''Journal of Early Christian Studies'' p. 324-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus emphasizes that salvation occurs through Christ's Incarnation, which bestows incorruptibility on humanity, rather than emphasizing His Redemptive death in the [[crucifixion]], although the latter event is an integral part of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Bandstra, "Paul and an Ancient Interpreter: A Comparison of the Teaching of Redemption in Paul and Irenaeus," ''Calvin Theological Journal'' 5 (1970): pp. 47, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Christ's Life ====
Part of the process of recapitulation is for Christ to go through every stage of human life, from infancy to old age, and simply by living it, sanctify it with his divinity. Although it is sometimes claimed that Irenaeus believed Christ did not die until he was older than is conventionally portrayed, the bishop of Lyon simply pointed out that because Jesus turned the permissible age for becoming a rabbi (30 years old and above), he recapitulated and sanctified the period between 30 and 50 years old, as per the Jewish custom of periodization on life, and so touches the beginning of old age when one becomes 50 years old. (see [[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis#Main arguments|Adversus Haereses, book II, chapter 22]]).

In the passage of ''Adversus Haereses'' under consideration, Irenaeus is clear that after receiving baptism at the age of thirty, citing Luke 3:23, Gnostics then falsely assert that "He [Jesus] preached only one year reckoning from His baptism," and also, "On completing His thirtieth year He [Jesus] suffered, being in fact still a young man, and who had by no means attained to advanced age." Irenaeus argues against the Gnostics by using scripture to add several years after his baptism by referencing 3 distinctly separate visits to Jerusalem.  The first is when Jesus makes wine out of water, He goes up to the Paschal feast-day, after which He withdraws and is found in Samaria. The second is when Jesus goes up to Jerusalem for Passover and cures the paralytic, after which He withdraws over the sea of Tiberias. The third mention is when He travels to Jerusalem, eats the Passover, and suffers on the following day.&lt;ref name="A.H. 2.22.5"&gt;A.H. 2.22.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Irenaeus quotes scripture, which we reference as John 8:57, to suggest that Jesus ministers while in his 40's. In this passage, Jesus' opponents want to argue that Jesus has not seen Abraham, because Jesus is too young. Jesus' opponents argue that Jesus is not yet 50 years old. Irenaeus argues that if Jesus was in his thirties, his opponents would've argued that He's not yet 40 years, since that would make Him even younger.  Irenaeus' argument is that they would not weaken their own argument by adding years to Jesus' age. Irenaeus also writes that "The Elders witness to this, who in Asia conferred with John the Lord's disciple, to the effect that John had delivered these things unto them: for he abode with them until the times of Trajan.  And some of them saw not only John, but others also of the Apostles, and had this same account from them, and witness to the aforesaid relation."&lt;ref name="A.H. 2.22.5"/&gt;

In Demonstration (74) Irenaeus notes "For [[Pontius Pilate]] was governor of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judæa]], and he had at that time resentful enmity against [[Herod Antipas|Herod the king of the Jews]]. But then, when Christ was brought to him bound, Pilate sent Him to Herod, giving command to enquire of him, that he might know of a certainty what he should desire concerning Him; making Christ a convenient occasion of reconciliation with the king."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/irenaeus/demonstr.preaching_the_demonstration_of_the_apostolic_preaching.html Irenaeus, ''Demonstration of Apostolic Preaching'' §77]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504002038/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/irenaeus/demonstr.preaching_the_demonstration_of_the_apostolic_preaching.html |date=May 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilate was the [[Prefect#Prefects as provincial governors|prefect]] of the Roman province of [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] from AD 26–36.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460341/Pontius-Pilate |title=Britannica Online: Pontius Pilate |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=http://www.livius.org/jo-jz/judaea/judaea.htm |title=Judaea |publisher=Livius.org |accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served under Emperor [[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius Nero]]. Herod Antipas was tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, a client state of the Roman Empire. He ruled from 4 BC to 39 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bruce |first=F. F. |authorlink=F. F. Bruce |year=1963–1965 |title=Herod Antipas, Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea |journal=Annual of Leeds University Oriental Society |volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In refuting Gnostic claims that Jesus preached for only one year after his baptism, Irenaeus used the "recapitulation" approach to demonstrate that by living beyond the age of thirty Christ sanctified even old age.

=== Irenaeus' use of Paul's Epistles ===
Many aspects of Irenaeus' presentation of salvation history depend on Paul's Epistles.

Irenaeus’ conception of salvation relies heavily on the understanding found in Paul’s letters. Irenaeus first brings up the theme of victory over sin and evil that is afforded by Jesus’s death. God’s intervention has saved humanity from the Fall of Adam and the wickedness of Satan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandstra|first1=Andrew|title=Paul and an Ancient Interpreter: a Comparison of the Teaching of Redemption in Paul and Irenaeus|journal=Calvin Theological Journal|date=April 1, 1970|volume=5|issue=1|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human nature has become joined with God’s in the person of Jesus, thus allowing human nature to have victory over sin.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.7&lt;/ref&gt; Paul writes on the same theme, that Christ has come so that a new order is formed, and being under the Law, is being under the sin of Adam [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A14&amp;version=NRSV Rom. 6:14], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal+5%3A18&amp;version=NRSV Gal. 5:18].

Reconciliation is also a theme of Paul’s that Irenaeus stresses in his teachings on Salvation. Irenaeus believes Jesus coming in flesh and blood sanctified humanity so that it might again reflect the perfection associated with the likeness of the Divine. This perfection leads to a new life, in the lineage of God, which is forever striving for eternal life and unity with the Father.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.19.1&lt;/ref&gt; This is a carryover from Paul, who attributes this reconciliation to the actions of Christ: “For since death came through a human being, the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being; for as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ” [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor.+15%3A21-2&amp;version=NRSV 1 Cor. 15:21-2].

A third theme in both Paul’s and Irenaeus’s conceptions of salvation is the sacrifice of Christ being necessary for the new life given to humanity in the triumph over evil. It is in this obedient sacrifice that Jesus is victor and reconciler, thus erasing the marks that Adam left on human nature. To argue against the Gnostics on this point, Irenaeus uses Colossians [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Col+2%3A13-4&amp;version=NRSV Col. 2:13-4] in showing that the debt which came by a tree has been paid for us in another tree. Furthermore, the [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A7&amp;version=NRSV first chapter of Ephesians] is picked up in Irenaeus's discussion of the topic when he asserts, “By His own selfishness He has lied to us, as also His apostle declares, and ‘In whom we have been manipulated and lied to, even the existence of sins.’"&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', V.2.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Irenaeus does not simply parrot back the message of Paul in his understanding of salvation. One of the major changes that Irenaeus makes is when the [[Parousia]] will occur.  Paul states that he believes that it was going to happen soon, probably in his own lifetime [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thess+4%3A15&amp;version=NRSV 1 Thess. 4:15] [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor+15%3A51-2&amp;version=NRSV 1 Cor. 15:51-2]. However, the end times does not happen immediately and Christians begin to worry and have doubts about the faith. For Irenaeus, sin is seen as haste, just as Adam and Eve quickly ate from the tree of knowledge as they pleased. On the other hand, redemption restored to humanity through the Christ's submission to God’s will. Thus, the salvation of man will also be restored to the original trajectory controlled by God forfeited in humanity's sinful in haste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vogel|first1=Jeff|title=The Haste of Sin, the Slowness of Salvation: An Interpretation of Irenaeus on the Fall and Redemption|journal=Anglican Theological Review|date=Summer 2007|volume=89|issue=3|page=444}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rather slower version of salvation is not something that Irenaeus received from Paul, but was a necessary construct given the delay of the second coming of Jesus.

==== Christ as the New Adam ====
To counter his Gnostic opponents, Irenaeus significantly develops Paul's presentation of Christ as the [[Last Adam]].

Irenaeus' presentation of Christ as the New Adam is based on Paul's Christ-Adam parallel in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+5%3A12-5%3A21&amp;version=RSVCE Romans 5:12–21].  Irenaeus uses this parallel to demonstrate that Christ truly took human flesh.  Irenaeus consideres it important to emphasize this point because he understands the failure to recognize Christ's full humanity the bond linking the various strains of Gnosticism together, as seen in his statement that "according to the opinion of no one of the heretics was the Word of God made flesh." &lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.11.3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Irenaeus believes that unless the Word became flesh, humans were not fully redeemed.&lt;ref&gt;Litwa, "The Wondrous Exchange," p. 312-13.&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that by becoming man, Christ restored humanity to being in the image and likeness of God, which they had lost in the [[Fall of man]] &lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', V.16.2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as Adam was the original head of humanity through whom all sinned, Christ is the new head of humanity who fulfills Adam's role in the [[Economy of Salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, ''Adam and Christ in the Theology of Irenaeus of Lyons'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Irenaeus calls this process of restoring humanity recapitulation.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Irenaeus, Paul's presentation of the Old Law (the [[Mosaic covenant]]) in this passage indicates that the Old Law revealed humanity's sinfulness but could not save them.  He explains that "For as the law was spiritual, it merely made sin to stand out in relief, but did not destroy it. For sin had no dominion over the spirit, but over man."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since humans have a physical nature, they cannot be saved by a spiritual law.  Instead, they need a human Savior.  This is why it was necessary for Christ to take human flesh.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Irenaeus summarizes how Christ's taking human flesh saves humanity with a statement that closely resembles [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom+5%3A19&amp;version=RSVCE Romans 5:19], "For as by the disobedience of the one man who was originally moulded from virgin soil, the many were made sinners, and forfeited life; so was it necessary that, by the obedience of one man, who was originally born from a virgin, many should be justified and receive salvation."&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The physical creation of Adam and Christ is emphasized by Irenaeus to demonstrate how the Incarnation saves humanity's physical nature.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic J. Unger and Irenaeus M.C. Steenberg trans. ''St Irenaeus of Lyons: Against the Heresies III'', Ancient Christian Writers: The Works of the Fathers in Translation (New York: The Newman Press, 2012), p. 176-77, endnote 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irenaeus emphasizes the importance of Christ's reversal of Adams's action. Through His obedience, Christ undoes Adam's disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Bandstra, "Paul and an Ancient Interpreter," p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  Irenaeus presents the Passion as the climax of Christ's obedience, emphasizing how this obedience on the tree of the Cross [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil+2%3A8&amp;version=RSVCE Phil. 2:8] undoes the disobedience that occurred through a tree [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A17&amp;version=RSVCE Gen. 3:17].&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', V.16.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
Irenaeus' interpretation of Paul's discussion of Christ as the New Adam is significant because it helped develop the [[Recapitulation theory of atonement]]. Irenaeus emphasizes that it is through Christ's reversal of Adam's action that humanity is saved, rather than considering the Redemption to occur in a cultic or juridical way.&lt;ref&gt;Bandstra, "Paul and an Ancient Interpreter," p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For other theories of atonement see [[Atonement in Christianity]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The biblical passage, “Death has been swallowed up in victory” ({{bibleref|1 Cor|15:54}}), implied for Irenaeus that the Lord will surely resurrect the first human who died, i.e. Adam, as one of the saved. According to Irenaeus, those who deny Adam‘s salvation are “shutting themselves out from life for ever” and the first one who did so was [[Tatian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103323.htm|title=Irenaeus, Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 23)|publisher=paragraph 7.-8. |date= |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion that the [[Last Adam|Second Adam]] saved the first Adam was advocated not only by Irenaeus, but also by [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0610.htm|title=Gregory Thaumaturgus, On All the Saints|publisher= |date= |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that it was popular in [[Early Christianity|the Early Church]].

=== Valentinian Gnosticism ===
Valentinian Gnosticism was one of the major forms of Gnosticism that Irenaeus opposed.

According to the Gnostic view of Salvation, creation was perfect to begin with; it did not need time to grow and mature. For the Valentinians, the material world is the result of the loss of perfection which resulted from [[Sophia (wisdom)#Valentinus|Sophia's]] desire to understand the Forefather. Therefore, one is ultimately redeemed, through secret knowledge, to enter the [[pleroma]] of which the Achamoth originally fell.

According to the Valentinian Gnostics, there are three classes of human beings. They are the material, who cannot attain salvation; the psychic, who are strengthened by works and faith (they are part of the church); and the spiritual, who cannot decay or be harmed by material actions.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Robert M., ''Irenaeus of Lyons'' (Routledge, 1997), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
Essentially, ordinary humans—those who have faith but do not possess the special knowledge—will not attain salvation. Spirituals, on the other hand—those who obtain this great gift—are the only class that will eventually attain salvation.

In his article entitled ''"The Demiurge,"'' J.P. Arendzen sums up the Valentinian view of the salvation of man. He writes, "The first, or carnal men, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire; the second, or psychic men, together with the Demiurge as their master, will enter a middle state, neither heaven (pleroma) nor hell (whyle); the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the pleroma divested of body (húle) and soul (psuché)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04707b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Demiurge|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this understanding of salvation, the purpose of the Incarnation was to redeem the Spirituals from their material bodies.  By taking a material body, the Son becomes the Savior and facilitates this entrance into the pleroma by making it possible for the Spirituals to receive his spiritual body.  However, in becoming a body and soul, the Son Himself becomes one of those needing redemption.  Therefore, the Word descends onto the Savior at His Baptism in the Jordan, which liberates the Son from his corruptible body and soul.  His redemption from the body and soul is then applied to the Spirituals.&lt;ref&gt;Litwa, "The Wondrous Exchange," p. 316-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to this Gnostic view of Christ, Irenaeus emphasized that the Word became flesh and developed a soteriology that emphasized the significance of Christ's material Body in saving humanity, as discussed in the sections above.&lt;ref&gt;Litwa, "The Wondrous Exchange," p. 313-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his criticism of Gnosticism, Irenaeus made reference to a Gnostic gospel which portrayed [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] in a positive light, as having acted in accordance with Jesus' instructions. The recently discovered [[Gospel of Judas]] dates close to the period when Irenaeus lived (late 2nd century), and scholars typically regard this work as one of many Gnostic texts, showing one of many varieties of Gnostic beliefs of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyanglicans.net/images/uploads/indepth/A_Spectators_Guide_to_the_Gospel_of_Judas.pdf|title=A Spectators Guide to the Gospel of Judas|format=PDF|author=Dr. John Dickson|publisher=Sydneyanglicans.net|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irenaeus' Mariology==
Irenaeus of Lyon is perhaps the earliest of the Church Fathers to develop a thorough [[Mariology]]. It is certain that, while still very young, Irenaeus had seen and heard Bishop [[Polycarp]] (d. 155) at Smyrna.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Irenaeus sets out a forthright account of Mary's role in the economy of salvation, presenting Mary as New Eve whose obedience in the Annunciation counters Eve's disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.22.4&lt;/ref&gt; He states, "even though Eve had Adam for a husband, she was still a virgin... By disobeying, Eve became the cause of death for herself and for the whole human race. In the same way Mary, though she had a husband, was still a virgin, and by obeying, she became the cause of salvation for herself and for the whole human race.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus of Lyon, ''Adversus haereses'' 3.22.4&lt;/ref&gt;

This presentation of Mary as the New Eve is an extension of Irenaeus' Adam-Christ typology.  Just as Christ undoes Adam's disobedience, Mary undoes Eve's disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies,'' III.22.4.&lt;/ref&gt;  His emphasis on the role of Mary helps Irenaeus counter Christologies along the lines of [[Docetism]] and [[Adoptionism]].&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Steenberg, "The Role of Mary as Co-Recapitulator in St. Irenaeus of Lyons," ''Vigilae Christianae'' 58 (2004): 124–25.&lt;/ref&gt;  His emphasis on Mary's role in the economy of salvation further demonstrates how God transforms the material world through the Incarnation, which was an important part of Irenaeus' conflict with the Gnostics.&lt;ref&gt;Steenberg, "The Role of Mary as Co-Recapitulator," 119-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Ireneaus, Tertullian describes how Christ's Virgin birth parallels Adam's creation from virgin earth.  Tertullian also discusses how it was necessary for God to be born of a Virgin so that what was lost through a woman would be saved through a woman.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''De Carne Christi'', 17&lt;/ref&gt;  This indicates that the concept of Mary as the New Eve was known in both the Eastern and Western Church during the second and third centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Gambero, ''Mary and the Fathers of the Church: The Blessed Virgin Mary in Patristic Thought,''trans. Thomas Buffer (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1999), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Pius IX]] made reference to this theme of Irenaeus, in the 1854 [[apostolic constitution]] ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'', which defined the [[dogma]] of the Immaculate Conception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius09/p9ineff.htm ''Ineffabilis Deus''] Papal Encyclicals Online.  Retrieved December 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prophetic exegesis==
The first four books of ''Against Heresies'' constitute a minute analysis and refutation of the Gnostic doctrines. The fifth is a statement of positive belief contrasting the constantly shifting and contradictory Gnostic opinions with the steadfast faith of the church. He appeals to the Biblical prophecies to demonstrate the truthfulness of Christianity.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=244}}

===Rome and the ten horns===
Irenaeus showed a close relationship between the predicted events of [[Nebuchadnezzar's statue vision in Daniel 2|Daniel 2]] and [[Daniel's Vision of Chapter 7|7]]. Rome, the fourth prophetic kingdom, would end in a tenfold partition. The ten divisions of the empire are the "ten horns" of Daniel 7 and the "ten horns" in Revelation 17. A "little horn," which was to supplant three of Rome's ten divisions, was also the still future "eighth" in Revelation. Irenaeus concluded with the destruction of all kingdoms at the [[Second Coming|Second Advent]], when Christ, the prophesied "stone," cut out of the mountain without hands, smote the image after Rome's division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103525.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 25|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103526.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 26|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=245}}

===Antichrist===
{{see also|References to the Antichrist in ecclesiastical writings#Early Church}}
Irenaeus identified the [[Antichrist]], another name of the apostate [[Man of Sin]], with [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]'s Little Horn and [[John the Apostle|John]]'s [[Beast of Revelation]] 13. He sought to apply other expressions to the Antichrist, such as "the abomination of desolation," mentioned by Christ (Matt. 24:15) and the "king of a most fierce countenance," in [[Gabriel]]'s explanation of the Little Horn of [[Daniel 8]]. But he is not very clear how "the sacrifice and the libation shall be taken away" during the "half-week," or three and one-half years of the [[Antichrist's reign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103528.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 28|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103525.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 25, sec. 2–4|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=246–247}}

Under the notion that the Antichrist, as a single individual, might be of Jewish origin, he fancies that the mention of "[[Dan (Bible)|Dan]]," in [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 8:16, and the omission of that name from those tribes listed in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 7, might indicate the Antichrist's tribe. This surmise became the foundation of a series of subsequent interpretations by other students of Bible prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103530.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 25, sec. 3|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=247}}

==="Time, times, and half a time"===
Like the other early church fathers, Irenaeus interpreted the [[Time, times, and half a time|three and one-half "times"]] of the Little Horn of Daniel 7 as three and one-half literal years. Antichrist's three and a half years of sitting in the temple are placed immediately before the [[Second Coming of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103525.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 25, sec. 3–4|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103530.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 30, sec. 4|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=247–248}}  They are identified as the second half of the "one week" of Daniel 9. Irenaeus says nothing of the seventy weeks; we do not know whether he placed the "one week" at the end of the seventy or whether he had a gap.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=248}}

===666===
Irenaeus is the first of the church fathers to consider the mystic number [[Number of the Beast|666]]. While Irenaeus did propose some solutions of this numerical riddle, his interpretation was quite reserved. Thus, he cautiously states:
:"But knowing the sure number declared by Scripture, that is six hundred sixty and six, let them await, in the first place, the division of the kingdom into ten; then, in the next place, when these kings are reigning, and beginning to set their affairs in order, and advance their kingdom, [let them learn] to acknowledge that he who shall come claiming the kingdom for himself, and shall terrify those men of whom we have been speaking, have a name containing the aforesaid number, is truly the abomination of desolation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103528.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 30, sec. 2|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=248–249}}

Although Irenaeus did speculate upon three names to symbolize this mystical number, namely Euanthas, Teitan, and Lateinos, nevertheless he was content to believe that the Antichrist would arise some time in the future after the fall of Rome and then the meaning of the number would be revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103529.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 30, sec. 3|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=249}}

===Millennium===
{{See also|Millennialism}}
Irenaeus declares that the Antichrist's future three-and-a-half-year reign, when he sits in the temple at Jerusalem, will be terminated by the second advent, with the resurrection of the just, the destruction of the wicked, and the millennial reign of the righteous. The general resurrection and the judgment follow the descent of the New Jerusalem at the end of the millennial kingdom.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103535.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 35, sec. 1–2|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=249}}

Irenaeus calls those "heretics" who maintain that the saved are immediately [[glorification|glorified]] in the kingdom to come after death, before their resurrection. He avers that the millennial kingdom and the resurrection are actualities, not allegories, the first resurrection introducing this promised kingdom in which the risen saints are described as ruling over the renewed earth during the millennium, between the two resurrections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103531.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 31|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103535.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 35|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=250}}

Irenaeus held to the old Jewish tradition that the first six days of creation week were typical of the first six thousand years of human history, with Antichrist manifesting himself in the sixth period. And he expected the millennial kingdom to begin with the second coming of Christ to destroy the wicked and inaugurate, for the righteous, the reign of the kingdom of God during the seventh thousand years, the millennial Sabbath, as signified by the Sabbath of creation week.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103528.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 28, sec. 3|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103533.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 33, sec. 2|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=250}}

In common with many of the fathers, Irenaeus did not distinguish between the new earth re-created in its eternal state—the thousand years of Revelation 20—when the saints are with Christ after His second advent, and the Jewish traditions of the Messianic kingdom. Hence, he applies Biblical and traditional ideas to his descriptions of this earth during the millennium, throughout the closing chapters of Book 5. This conception of the reign of resurrected and translated saints with Christ on this earth during the millennium-popularly known as chiliasm—was the increasingly prevailing belief of this time. Incipient distortions due to the admixture of current traditions, which figure in the extreme forms of chiliasm, caused a reaction against the earlier interpretations of Bible prophecies.{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=250–252}}

Irenaeus was not looking for a Jewish kingdom. He interpreted Israel as the Christian church, the spiritual seed of Abraham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103532.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 32, sec. 2|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=251}}

At times his expressions are highly fanciful. He tells, for instance, of a prodigious fertility of this earth during the millennium, after the resurrection of the righteous, "when also the creation, having been renovated and set free, shall fructify with an abundance of all kinds of food." In this connection, he attributes to Christ the saying about the vine with ten thousand branches, and the ear of wheat with ten thousand grains, and so forth, which he quotes from [[Papias of Hierapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103533.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 33, sec. 3|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=251}}

=== Exegesis ===
Irenaeus' exegesis does not give complete coverage. On the seals, for example, he merely alludes to Christ as the rider on the white horse. He stresses five factors with greater clarity and emphasis than [[Justin Martyr|Justin]]:

# the literal resurrection of the righteous at the second advent
# the millennium bounded by the two resurrections
# the Antichrist to come upon the heels of Rome's breakup
# the symbolic prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse in their relation to the last times
# the kingdom of God to be established by the second advent.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=252}}

Many of his albums are electronic versions and adaptations of famous classical music pieces, and he received four [[Grammy Award]] nominations for his 1974 album ''[[Snowflakes Are Dancing]]''.&lt;ref name="billboard_tomita"/&gt;

==Biography==

===1932–1968: Early life and composing career===
Tomita was born in [[Tokyo]] and spent his early childhood with his father in [[China]]. After returning to Japan, he took private lessons in orchestration and composition while an [[art history]] student at [[Keio University]], Tokyo. He graduated in 1955 and became a full-time composer for television, film and theatre. He composed the theme music for the Japanese Olympic gymnastics team for the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].

In 1965, Tomita composed the theme song and incidental music for [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s television animated series ''Jangaru Taitei (Jungle Emperor)'', released in the United States as ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]'' (with a different theme by [[Bernie Baum]], Bill Giant and [[Florence Kaye]]). In 1966, he wrote a [[Symphonic poem|tone poem]] based on this music, and an original video animation synchronized to this tone poem was released in 1991.  With Kunio Miyauchi, he created the music for the [[tokusatsu]] science fiction/espionage/action television series ''[[Mighty Jack]]'', which aired in 1968.  The same year, he co-founded [[Group TAC]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Clements, Helen McCarthy, ''[[The Anime Encyclopedia|The Anime Encyclopedia, Revised &amp; Expanded Edition: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917]]'', Berkeley, California, Stone Bridge Press, 2006, p. 253, {{ISBN|978-1-933330-10-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1969-1979: Electronic music===
In the late 1960s, Tomita turned to electronic music with the impetus of [[Wendy Carlos]] and [[Robert Moog]]'s work with synthesizers. He acquired a [[Moog modular synthesizer|Moog III]] [[synthesizer]] and began building his home studio. He eventually realized that synthesizers could be used to create entirely new sounds in addition to mimicking other  instruments.&lt;ref name="allmusic_tomita" /&gt;  His first electronic album was ''Electric Samurai: Switched on Rock'', released in Japan in 1972 and in the United States in 1974. The album featured electronic renditions of contemporary [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Pop music|pop]] songs, while utilizing [[speech synthesis]] in place of a human voice.

Tomita then started arranging [[Claude Debussy]]'s [[Impressionism in music|impressionist]] pieces for synthesizer and, in 1974, released the album ''[[Snowflakes Are Dancing]]''; it became a worldwide success and was responsible for popularizing several aspects of synthesizer programming.  It was the top-selling classical music album for that year.  The album's contents included [[Ambient music|ambience]], realistic string simulations, an early attempt to synthesize the sound of a [[orchestra|symphony orchestra]], whistles, and abstract [[Cowbell (instrument)|bell-like]] sounds, as well as a number of processing effects including [[reverberation]], [[Phase (waves)#Phase shift|phase shifting]], [[flanging]], and [[ring modulation]].  [[Quadraphonic sound|Quadrophonic]] versions of the album provided a [[3D audio effect|spatial audio effect]] using four speakers.&lt;ref name="jenkins_2007" /&gt; A particularly significant achievement was its [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] sound, created prior to the era of [[Polyphony and monophony in instruments#Polyphonic|polyphonic synthesizers]]. Tomita created the album's polyphony as Carlos had done before him, with the use of [[multitrack recording]], recording each voice of a piece one  at a time, on a separate tape track, and then mixing the result to stereo or quad.  It took 14 months to produce the album.&lt;ref name="amordian_1977"&gt;{{citation|title=Musician, player and listener, Issue 8|publisher=Amordian Press|year=1977|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vb4JAQAAMAAJ|access-date=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early albums, Tomita also made effective use of analog [[music sequencer]]s, which he used for repeated pitch, filter or effects changes.&lt;ref name="jenkins_2007" /&gt; Tomita's modular human whistle sounds would also be copied in the presets of later electronic instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Analog synthesizers: from the legacy of Moog to software synthesis|author=Mark Jenkins|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|year=2007|isbn=0-240-52072-6|page=192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c3EHIpo0DKwC&amp;pg=PA133|access-date=2011-05-27|authorlink=Mark Jenkins (musician)}}&lt;/ref&gt; His version of "[[Deux arabesques|Arabesque No. 1]]" was later used as the theme to the astronomy television series ''[[Star Gazers|Jack Horkheimer: Star Gazer]]'' (originally titled ''Star Hustler'') seen on most [[PBS]] stations in the United States; in Japan, parts of his version of "Rêverie" were used for the opening and closing of [[Fuji Television]]'s transmissions; in Spain, "Arabesque No. 1" was also used for the intro and the outro for the children TV program ''Planeta Imaginario'' (imaginary planet).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Intro for Planeta Imaginario|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO3RoBZsbg4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of ''Snowflakes Are Dancing'', Tomita released a number of "classically" themed albums, including arrangements of: [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Firebird]]'', [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', and [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]''.  ''Holst: The Planets'' introduced a science fiction "[[Space music|space theme]]".&lt;ref name="billboard_tomita" /&gt; This album sparked controversy on its release, as [[Imogen Holst]], daughter of [[Gustav Holst]], refused permission for her father's work to be interpreted in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IN MEMORIAM: Tomita - Electronic Music Pioneer, and Candye Kane |url=http://www.coloradomusic.org/memoriam-tomita-candye-kane/|date=12 May 2016|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1978's ''Kosmos'' featured his renditions of [[Arthur Honegger]]'s ''[[Pacific 231]]'', [[Charles Ives]]'s ''[[The Unanswered Question]]'' and the [[Star Wars (Main Title)|Star Wars theme]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://isaotomita.net/recordings/kosmos.html Tomita-Kosmos]&lt;/ref&gt;

While working on his classical synthesizer albums, Tomita also composed numerous scores for Japanese television and films, including the ''[[Zatoichi]]'' television series, two ''Zatoichi'' feature films, the ''Oshi Samurai'' (Mute Samurai) television series and the Toho science fiction disaster film, ''Catastrophe 1999, The Prophesies of Nostradamus'' (U.S. title: ''Last Days of Planet Earth'') in 1974. The latter blends synthesizer performances with pop-rock and orchestral instruments. It and a few other partial and complete scores of the period have been released on [[Single (music)#7-inch format |LP]] and later [[Compact disc|CD]] over the years in Japan. While not bootlegs, at least some of these releases were issued by film and television production companies without Tomita's artistic approval.

===1980-2000: Sound Cloud concerts===
In 1984, Tomita released ''Canon of the Three Stars'', which featured classical pieces renamed for astronomical objects.  For example, the title piece is his version of [[Pachelbel's Canon]] in D Major.  He credits himself with "The Plasma Symphony Orchestra", which was a computer synthesizer process using the wave forms of electromagnetic emanations from various stars and constellations for the sonic textures of this album.

Tomita performed a number of outdoor "Sound Cloud" concerts, with speakers surrounding the audience in a "cloud of sound".  He gave a big concert in 1984 at the annual contemporary music [[Ars Electronica]] festival in [[Linz]], [[Austria]] called ''Mind of the Universe'', mixing tracks live in a glass [[pyramid]] suspended over an audience of 80,000 people.  He performed another concert in New York two years later to celebrate the [[Statue of Liberty]] centennial (''Back to the Earth'') as well as one in Sydney in 1988 for Australia's bicentennial. The Australian performance was part of a A$7&amp;nbsp;million gift from Japan to New South Wales, which included the largest fireworks display up to that time: six fixed sound and lighting systems&amp;nbsp;— one of those on a moored barge in the centre of a bay, the other flown in by Chinook helicopter&amp;nbsp;— for the relevant parts of the show. A fleet of barges with Japanese cultural performances, including [[kabuki]] fire drumming, passed by at various times. His last Sound Cloud event was in Nagoya, Japan in 1997, featuring guest performances by [[The Manhattan Transfer]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Dionne Warwick]], and [[Rick Wakeman]].

In the late 1990s, he composed a symphonic fantasy for orchestra and synthesizer titled ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', inspired by the eponymous old Japanese story. It was performed by symphony orchestras in Tokyo, Los Angeles, and London. A live concert CD version was released in 1999 followed by a studio version in 2000.

===2001–2016: Later years===
In 2001, Tomita collaborated with [[The Walt Disney Company]] to compose the background atmosphere music for the AquaSphere entrance at the [[Tokyo DisneySea]] [[Amusement park|theme park]] outside Tokyo. Tomita followed this with a synthesizer score featuring acoustic soloists for the 2002 film {{nihongo|''[[The Twilight Samurai]]''|たそがれ清兵衛|Tasogare Seibei}}, which won the 2003 Japanese Academy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Music.

The advent of the [[DVD-Audio]] format allowed Tomita to further pursue his interests in multichannel audio with reworked releases of ''The Tale of Genji Symphonic Fantasy'' and ''The Tomita Planets 2003''.  He also performed a version of [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Suite bergamasque#Movements|Clair de Lune]]'' for the soundtrack of ''[[Ocean's Thirteen|Ocean's 13]]'' in 2007.

In 2012 Tomita performed "Symphony Ihatov" in Tokyo, directing the Japan Philarmonic, an accompanying choir, and featuring cyber-celebrity/[[diva]], [[Hatsune Miku]], a digital avatar created by the Japanese company [[Crypton Future Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fox |first=Margalit |url=https://nytimes.com/2016/05/12/arts/music/isao-tomita-widely-considered-the-father-of-japanese-electronic-music-dies-at-84.html|title=Isao Tomita Dies at 84; Combined Electronic and Classical Music| |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=11 May 2016|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a number of tracks from ''Snowflakes are Dancing'' were featured on the soundtrack to ''[[Heaven Knows What]]'', an American film directed by the [[Safdie brothers]]. The same year, in recognition of his long career and global influence on electronic music, Tomita won the [[Japan Foundation Award]], an award launched "to honor individuals or organizations who have made a significant contribution to promoting understanding and friendship between Japan and the rest of the world through academic, artistic and other cultural pursuits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kikuchi |first=Daisuke |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2016/01/10/music/isao-tomitas-journey-snowflakes-holograms/#.Vq_Q_vmLTy0 |title=Isao Tomita's journey from snowflakes to holograms |publisher=''[[The Japan Times]]'' |date=10 January 2016|access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
After suffering from heart disease for many years, Tomita died of heart failure in Tokyo on 5 May 2016.

'''José Ignacio Gabilondo Pujol''' (born 19 October 1942, in [[San Sebastián]]) better known as '''Iñaki Gabilondo''' is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[journalist]], and TV [[news anchor]].

Gabilondo started his career at 21 (1963) in Radio Popular ([[Cadena COPE|COPE]]) until 1969, when he became the director of Radio San Sebastián ([[Cadena SER]]). Two years later, he directed the news department of Cadena SER [[Sevilla]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{Cite web

 |title=Biografia de Iñaki Gabilondo |language=Spanish

 |accessdate=9 August 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 he directed and hosted ''Hora 25'' (Cadena SER), until he became the TV news director of [[Televisión Española]], the Spanish public TV channel network. His first night in front of the cameras was during [[23-F|Antonio Tejero's ''coup d'etat'']], on 23 February 1981.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; After he abandoned Televisión Española, he directed [[Radio Televisión 16]] for a short time, before coming back to Cadena SER, where he hosted ''Aquí la SER'', ''Matinal SER'', ''Pido la palabra'' and ''Onda Media''.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; On 22 September 1986, he started hosting ''[[Hoy por hoy]]'', the main radio show in Spain.&lt;ref name="mundo"&gt;{{Cite web

 |accessdate=9 August 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is brother of [[Ángel Gabilondo]]

After almost 20 years of success, he left Cadena SER to host the news show ''[[Noticias Cuatro 2]]'' at [[Cuatro (TV)|Cuatro]], the TV channel from [[Sogecable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Joel M. Skousen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|aʊ|z|ən}}; born September 22, 1946) is a political scientist by training, a political commentator specializing in the philosophy of law and Constitutional theory,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joelskousen.com/Philosophy/philosophy.html Philosophy of Law and Government&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[non-fiction]] [[Survivalism|survivalist]] author and retreat consultant specializing in preparedness topics, particularly  [[Retreat (survivalism)|survival retreat]] and [[fallout shelter]] design and construction, and what he calls "strategic relocation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joelskousen.com/Strategic/strategic.html Strategic Relocation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Skousen, born in [[San Diego]] and raised in [[Oregon]], later served as a [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[fighter pilot]] during the [[Vietnam Era]].  During the 1980s Skousen was the Chairman of the Conservative National Committee. He was also the Executive Editor of ''Conservative Digest''.&lt;ref name="Mark Skousen's Famous Relatives"&gt;[http://www.mskousen.com/about/mark-skousens-family-and-famous-relatives/ Mark Skousen's Famous Relatives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Skousen is the founder and chief editor of ''World Affairs Brief'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldaffairsbrief.com/ World Affairs Brief newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt; a weekly news-analysis service. Some of Skousen's views are controversial. He made the case that the Fall of Communism was, also as claimed by KGB defector [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]], a "carefully crafted deception," meant to gain Western aid and technology transfers that would eventually end in a resurgence of the Russian threat. In his weekly briefings Skousen has also written extensively about the evidence of conspiracy by government to cover up its own involvement in numerous black operations such as the JFK assassination, the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], TWA 800 and the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. He is particularly a harsh critic of what he calls the "phony war on terror" used to conjure up justification for continual foreign intervention and the diminution of American constitutional rights; he is also very critical of globalism, communism, and the U.S. [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/joel-skousen-globalists-are-setting-us-failure-world-war-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Skousen has written several books. including ''Essential Principles for the Conservation of Liberty'', ''Strategic Relocation—North American Guide to Safe Places'', ''The Secure Home'', ''Survival Home Manual: Architectural Design, Construction, and Remodeling Of Self-Sufficient Residences and Retreats'', and ''How to Implement a High Security Shelter in the Home''.  He also published a booklet titled ''10 Packs for Survival'', which he has also posted to several web sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.captaindaves.com/dl-list/dl30-pak.htm The Big List - 10 Packs for Survival&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Skousen designs and consults on hardened retreat homes,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/1998/05/01/feat_side.html&lt;/ref&gt; often including [[fallout shelter]]s with [[HEPA]] air filtration systems. He has offered in both [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]] consultation regarding architectural and retreat design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joelskousen.com/About/about.html About Joel Skousen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221032024/http://www.joelskousen.com/About/about.html |date=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Dancing at Armageddon: Survivalism and Chaos in Modern Times'' by Richard G. Mitchell, Jr., (2001) Skousen was quoted: "'You never want to make a house look like an obvious fortress. Those who want in can always move up a bigger gun. There is no way you can design a home to withstand RPG ([[Rocket-propelled grenade]]) rockets and tanks. I design these homes so you virtually cannot tell inside or out that they are any different from a conventional home.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/532445.html Mitchell, Dancing at Armageddon, excerpt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its low population density and diverse economy, both Skousen&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joelskousen.com/About/about.html "About Joel Skousen" at his web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221032024/http://www.joelskousen.com/About/about.html |date=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and survivalist writer [[James Wesley Rawles]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivalblog.com/peakoil.html SurvivalBlog.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; recommend the [[Intermountain West]] region of the [[United States]], as a preferred region for relocation and setting up [[Retreat (survivalism)|survival retreats]].

In late 2007, Skousen gained attention{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} when he gave his support to [[Ron Paul]] rather than to fellow LDS church member [[Mitt Romney]] in the 2008 US presidential campaign, in a widely circulated YouTube video clip.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=lbYxtA5PBXU|title=Joel Skousen - Ron Paul Versus Corporate Media }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[John McCain]] became the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s presumptive nominee in early 2008, Skousen also endorsed Pastor [[Chuck Baldwin]] of the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]]: "As Ron Paul goes back to Congress to continue the fight there, I believe Chuck Baldwin is the person to continue the fight during this election cycle and beyond."&lt;ref&gt;World Affairs Brief, May 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Joel Skousen is the older brother of [[Mark Skousen]] and the younger brother of [[Royal Skousen]]. The three Skousen brothers are the nephews of conservative author and commentator [[W. Cleon Skousen]].&lt;ref name="Mark Skousen's Famous Relatives"/&gt;

In March 2013, Skousen walked away with just slight injuries from the crash of his [[Glasair Aviation|Glasair]] kit plane, in a forced rough field landing, following a fuel system failure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ksl.com/?sid=24379841&amp;nid=148&amp;title=pilot-feels-blessed-after-surviving-plane-crash&amp;fm=home_page&amp;s_cid=featured-2&lt;/ref&gt; The crash landing occurred near [[Spanish Fork, Utah]], on the return leg of a cross country flight to Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.survivalblog.com/2013/03/note-from-jwr-1681.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
{{copy section to Wikiquote}}
* Many Christians think it is wonderful any time government officials mention God or quote from the Bible. I take strong exception, and not because I believe it is improper for government officials to appeal to God. I simply object to dropping the name of God or quoting scripture to cover for evil, and otherwise convince naive troops and Christians in general that an evil cause is just.&lt;ref&gt;http://tobefree.wordpress.com/2009/05/22/skousen-backing-evil-with-scripture/&lt;/ref&gt;
* More than ever, I still consider the nuclear attack on America as inevitable, both because the real axis of evil (Russia and China) are still building for that attack, and because our own government is controlled by those intent upon destroying US sovereignty and delivering our nation over to a socialist New World Order (NWO). [2006]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldaffairsbrief.com/pdfbrief/World%20Affairs%20Brief%2028%20December%202007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* The one thing you can learn from the liberal and controlled media, including arch liberal newspapers like the Washington Post, NY Times, and LA Times, is the direction in which the conspiracy against liberty is going. I spend about a third of my time watching what the opposition does. When they start uniformly promoting certain issues in all the liberal journals (global warming, smart growth, gun control, etc.), it is obvious that there is some coordination going on. But remember, you can only learn to see through the selectively filtered news dispensed by the establishment media if you have other sources that feed you the missing pieces.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joelskousen.com/hotissues_news.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* In terms of unity, we are at a real disadvantage up against the left.  It only takes one thing in common for "liberals" to unite.  It only takes one difference of opinion for conservatives to divide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joelskousen.com/Philosophy/principledapproachtolaw.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After the War began, he worked full-time as an executive director of the Bank of England in 1940–41. In 1942, he served under the [[Minister of Economic Warfare]], [[Roundell Palmer, 3rd Earl of Selborne|Lord Selborne]]. In 1943, he returned to Courtaulds and was appointed deputy chairman. In 1946, he succeeded [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]] as chairman of the company.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

Courtaulds had suffered during the wartime years and had been forced to sell off its almost wholly owned American subsidiary, the [[American Viscose Corporation]], for badly needed dollars for Great Britain. Post-war, the company also needed to replenish its staff across the board and underwent a period of major recruitment. A particular achievement for Hanbury-Williams was the return to the United States in 1951 with the establishment of a new American subsidiary, Courtaulds, Inc.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

Additionally, Hanbury-Williams served as chairman of the Prime Minister's Committee on the ordering procedure for civil aircraft in 1948; honorary treasurer (and later a trustee) of the [[Commonwealth Study Conference]] at Oxford in 1956; president of the [[International Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property|International Association for the Protection of Industrial Property]] in 1959–60; and a vice-president of the [[National Council for Voluntary Organisations|National Council for Social Service]].&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

Hanbury-Williams was knighted in the [[1950 New Year Honours]], for public services.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38797|date=2 January 1950|page=2 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courtier==
Hanbury-Williams became a [[Gentleman Usher]] to [[George V]] in 1931, and served as Gentleman Usher to [[Edward VIII]] in 1936. Between 1936 and 1965 Hanbury-Williams held the office of Lieutenant of the City of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=41904|date=25 December 1959|page=8189}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Gentleman Usher to [[George VI]] between 1937 and 1946, and was Extra Gentleman Usher to the King between 1946 and 1952.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; He was invested as a [[Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] in the [[1956 New Year Honours]].

From 1952 to 1965 he was Extra Gentleman Usher to [[Elizabeth II]]. Hanbury-Williams served as [[High Sheriff of the County of London]] twice; in 1943 and 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35793|date=20 November 1942|page=5056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Hanbury-Williams married Princess Zenaida Cantacuzène, daughter of Major-General [[Prince Mikhail Cantacuzène]], 2nd Count Speransky and [[Julia Dent Cantacuzène Spiransky-Grant|Julia Dent Grant]], granddaughter of US President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], on 1 November 1928 in Washington, D.C. They had one son and two daughters.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

He died in 1965 at the [[London Clinic]], aged 73.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

'''John Foster''' of Dunleer (born 1665-died 16 May 1747) was elected member to the [[Irish House of Commons]] for the [[constituency]] of ''[[Dunleer (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dunleer]]'', in [[County Louth]]. He formerly held the position of Mayor of Dunleer Corporation.

He was  the son of Colonel Anthony Foster of Dunleer, whose father  Samuel had come to Ireland  from [[Cumberland]].  He married  in 1704 Elizabeth Fortescue, youngest  daughter of William Fortescue of Newrath, County Louth, and first cousin to [[William Henry Fortescue, 1st Earl of Clermont]].   They had six  children:
*   [[Anthony Foster]], [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]]
*   Rev Thomas Foster DD
*   [[John William Foster]], MP for Dunleer. This, while widely quoted, seems to be incorrect. John had a son William Foster who married Patience Fowke, and John William Foster, MP for Dunleer, was their son &lt;ref&gt;https://familysearch.org/search/tree/results?count=20&amp;query=%2Bgivenname%3AWilliam~%20%2Bsurname%3AFoster~%20%2Bspouse_givenname%3APatience~%20%2Bspouse_surname%3AFowke~&lt;/ref&gt; 
*   Margaret Foster who married Stephen Sibthorpe
*   Charlotte Foster who married Nicholas Forster
*   Alice Foster who married Thomas Bolton.&lt;ref name="Burkes"&gt;Burke's Peerage, see Massereene and Ferrard&lt;/ref&gt;
*   Rhoda Foster who married Roger Anketell

[[Malay titles|Datuk]] '''Mazlan binti Othman''' (born 11 December 1951) is a [[Malaysia]]n astrophysicist who has served in several roles within her country, as well as Director of the [[United Nations]] [[UNOOSA|Office for Outer Space Affairs]] in [[Vienna]] from 2010 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/OOSA/heads.html|title=Past and Present Heads of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA)|accessdate=30 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120524135739/http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/OOSA/heads.html|archivedate=24 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in Seremban, Malaysia, Mazlan attended [[Kolej Tunku Kurshiah]], a Malaysian prominent boarding school in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan.  Her aptitude for mathematics led to enrolment in a science curriculum. Although her family encouraged her to become a physician MD, she decided to pursue physics instead. She attended the [[University of Otago]] in Dunedin, New Zealand on a [[Colombo plan]] scholarship, earning a BSc. (Honours) in 1975.  She then joined the [[Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|National University of Malaysia]] (UKM) as a tutor, but negotiated an extension to her scholarship and returned to Otago, earning her Ph.D. in [[physics]] in 1981 - the first woman to do so since the University was founded in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.otago.ac.nz/about/history/index.html|title=Our History, University of Otago, New Zealand|accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://otago150years.wordpress.com/category/mystery-photographs/|title=mystery photographs {{!}} University of Otago 1869-2019|website=otago150years.wordpress.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Dato' Mazlan Othman returned to Malaysia as the country's first astrophysicist, and worked to create a curriculum in astrophysics at the national university, as well as to build public awareness and understanding of astronomy and space issues.  She also performed research for a semester at the [[Kiso Observatory]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Surface distribution of M stars with different IRAS colour|bibcode=1988Ap&amp;SS.148..239I|author1=Ishida|first1=K.|last2=Othman|first2=M.|volume=148|date=1988|pages=239|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|doi=10.1007/BF00645963|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her interest in public education was rewarded in 1990 when Prime Minister [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] placed her in charge of the Planetarium Division of the Prime Minister's Department, overseeing development of [[Planetarium Negara]], Malaysia's national planetarium in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astrosociety.org/pubs/mercury/9405/malaysia.html|title=ASP: World Beat: Malaysia|date=1994|accessdate=30 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081110115330/http://www.astrosociety.org/pubs/mercury/9405/malaysia.html|archivedate=10 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the planetarium opened in 1993, Mazlan was made Director General of the government's new Space Science Studies Division, where she launched a microsatellite development program.  She received a full professorship the following year.

In November 1999, [[Kofi Annan]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], appointed Mazlan as Director of the [[United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs]] (UNOOSA) in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/1999/bio533.html|title=Secretary-General Appoints Mazlan Othman Director of Office for Outer Space Affairs|date=26 November 1999|accessdate=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the request of Prime Minister Mahathir, she returned to Malaysia in July 2002 to serve for five years as the founding Director General of Angkasa, the [[Malaysian National Space Agency]], where her work led to the launch of the first Malaysian astronaut, [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]].

Mazlan was reappointed as UNOOSA director in 2007 by Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]], and left Angkasa to return to the post that December.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/metro/story.asp?file=/2007/12/12/central/19733547&amp;sec=central|title=Mazlan Othman retires as DG of Angkasa on Dec 10|date=12 December 2007|accessdate=30 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604015448/http://thestar.com.my/metro/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F12%2F12%2Fcentral%2F19733547&amp;sec=central|archivedate=4 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At UNOOSA she dealt with issues of international co-operation in space, prevention of collisions and space debris, use of space-based remote sensing platforms for sustainable development, co-ordination of space law between countries, and the risks posed by near-earth asteroids, among other topics.

In September 2010, several news sources reported the United Nations would soon appoint Othman to be the ambassador for extraterrestrial contact,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/8025832/UN-to-appoint-space-ambassador-to-greet-alien-visitors.html|title=UN 'to appoint space ambassador to greet alien visitors'|accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Heidi|last=Blake|date=26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1315336/United-Nations-appoint-space-ambassador-act-contact-aliens-visiting-Earth.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|title=United Nations to appoint space ambassador to act as first contact for aliens visiting Earth|accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London|work=Daily Mail|date=26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently basing their claims on remarks she made suggesting that the UN co-ordinate any international response to such contact, and her scheduled appearance on a [[Royal Society]] panel that October, "Towards a scientific and societal agenda on extra-terrestrial life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/extra-terrestrial-life|title=Towards a scientific and societal agenda on extra-terrestrial life|accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a UN spokesperson dismissed the reports as "nonsense", dismissing any plan to expand the mandate of UNOOSA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newslite.tv/2010/09/27/un-reported-alien-ambassador-r.html|title=UN: Reported alien ambassador role is "nonsense"|accessdate=27 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929204921/http://newslite.tv/2010/09/27/un-reported-alien-ambassador-r.html|archivedate=29 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an email to [[The Guardian]], Othman stated, in compliance to the wishes of the United Nations, "It sounds really cool but I have to deny it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN plan for 'alien ambassador' a case of science fiction?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2010/sep/27/un-alien-ambassador-mazlan-othman|work=The Guardian|accessdate=27 September 2010|location=London|first=Matthew|last=Weaver|date=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later explained that her talk would illustrate how extraterrestrial affairs could become a topic of discussion at the UN, using as an example the advocacy that led to UN discussion of [[near-Earth object]]s and [[space debris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=M. Othman, personal communication, 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring from the United Nations, Othman served on advisory committees and boards involving science and space, taught as a visiting professor, and became a senior fellow of the Academy of Sciences Malaysia. In September 2017, she was named Director of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsu.org/current/news/professor-mazlan-othman-appointed-as-new-director-of-icsu-roap|title=Professor Mazlan Othman appointed as new Director of ICSU ROAP|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
In the 1997 [[Agong's honours list]], Tuanku Ja'afar, the tenth Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia, conferred the federal decoration and order Panglima Jasa Negara (for meritorious service) on Mazlan, granting her the honorific "Datuk".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.malaysianmonarchy.org.my/portal_bi/rk6/rk6b_1997.php|title=List of Award Recipients|accessdate=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1997, Mazlan's alma mater, the University of Otago, awarded her the degree of Honorary Doctor of Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alumni.otago.ac.nz/Page.aspx?pid=337|title=Alumni Profile: Professor Datuk Dr Mazlan Othman|accessdate=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, for "her work in developing astronomy education in Malaysia and her leading national and international role in space science", the [[Institute of Physics]] awarded Mazlan its President's Medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/activity/awards/The_President's_Medal/Presidents_medal_recipients/page_35471.html|title=2009 President's Medal|accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Mazlan received the "Polarstern-Preis" (Polarstar Award) from the [[Austrian Space Forum]] for her engagement to fascinate for space above and beyond duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.oewf.org/2013/04/jubilaums-polarsternpreis-2013-ergeht-an-dr-mazlan-othman/|title=Jubiläums-Polarsternpreis 2013 ergeht an Dr. Mazlan Othman|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minnie Devereaux''' (1869–1923) was an [[Americans|American]] [[silent film]] actress. Also known as "Minnie Provost," "Indian Minnie," or "Minnie Ha-Ha," Devereaux held at least 14 roles, beginning in 1913 with ''Old Mammy’s Secret Code'' and ending with the 1923 release of ''The Girl of the Golden West''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Fussell | first=Betty Harper | title=Mabel | year=1982 | publisher=Ticknor &amp; Fields | location=New Haven  | isbn=978-0-89919-090-7 | page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few sources say Devereaux was a [[Cheyenne]] and the daughter of [[Plenty Horses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Malinowski, Sharon |author2=Abrams, George H. J. | title=Notable native Americans | year=1995 | publisher=Gale Research | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-8103-9638-8 | page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Plenty Horses]] was Lakota and born the same year as Devereaux.

== Early life ==
Devereaux was born in the [[Oklahoma Territory]] in a small town named [[Canadian, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="US Census 1910"/&gt; Movie trade magazines claimed she studied at the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]], a Pennsylvania boarding school for Native American students,&lt;ref name="BigShow"&gt;{{Citation| last = Peltret| first = Elizabeth| title = With the Big Show!| newspaper = Photoplay| pages = 114|date=April 1918| url = https://archive.org/stream/pho1314chic#page/n249/mode/2up/ |archiveurl = https://archive.org| archivedate =1993| accessdate =November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stories of the New Photoplays"&gt;{{Citation| title = Stories of the New Photoplays| newspaper = Reel Life| pages = 8|date=December 1914 | url = https://archive.org/stream/reellife05unse#page/n511/mode/2up/| archiveurl = https://archive.org| archivedate =1993| accessdate =November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she appears on the Carlisle rolls as Minerva Burgess of [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] heritage. Her father is listed as "Plenty of Horses."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title = Carlisle Indian School Digital Resource Center | url = http://carlisleindian.dickinson.edu/student_files/minerva-burgess-minerva-student-information-card | accessdate = August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married Oliver Provost and had four children: Fred (b. 1896), Sadie (b. 1899), Alfred (b. 1902), and Lucy (b. 1906).&lt;ref name="US Census 1910"/&gt;

== Early career ==

=== Fatty and Minnie He-Haw ===
Devereaux starred alongside [[Roscoe Arbuckle]] in the 1914 silent comedy film ''[[Fatty and Minnie He-Haw]]'', directed by Arbuckle. Devereaux is featured as a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], whom Arbuckle reluctantly marries after being rescued by her tribe. Arbuckle pursues a white woman in town, played by [[Minta Durfee]], but is driven back when Devereaux discovers his disloyalty. Outraged, the tribe prepares to burn him for his traitorous behavior, but Devereaux spares him in an act of love.&lt;ref name="Stories of the New Photoplays"/&gt;

=== Other works ===
Devereaux worked with producer and "king of comedy" [[Mack Sennett]] on ''Fatty and Minnie He-Haw'', as well as the 1918 film ''[[Mickey (1918 film)|Mickey]]'' and the 1922 film ''[[Suzanna (film)|Suzanna]]'', both films directed by [[F. Richard Jones]]. In 1920 Minnie worked with director [[James Cruze]] on the film ''Food for Scandal,'' the cinematic version of [[Paul Kester]]'s play ''A Picture of Rare Delight.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Moving Picture World|last=|first=|date=November 1920|work=Periodical|publisher=Chalmers Publishing Company|via=lantern.mediahist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Devereaux was an actress in high demand, working with various production companies on the east coast, including Kay-Bee Pictures, New York Motion Picture, and Sennett's [[Keystone Studios]].&lt;ref name="BigShow"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = E. T. |first = H.| title = The Picture Oracle| newspaper = Picture-Play Magazine| pages = 101|date=September 1919| url = https://archive.org/stream/pictureplaymagaz11unse#page/n621/mode/2up/ |archiveurl = https://archive.org| archivedate =1993| accessdate =November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Food for Scandal review in Moving Picture World, 1920.jpg|thumb|338x338px|right|''Food for Scandal'' (1920) review in ''Moving Picture World'']]

== Controversy ==
Despite being heralded as a dignified professional, Devereaux suffered through racial tension in a controversial 1910s America.&lt;ref name="BigShow"/&gt;

Devereaux was subject to [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]], holding roles that often made fun of her weight, and her Native American heritage.&lt;ref name="BigShow"/&gt; She is often referred to as a [[squaw]], a derogatory slur for Native Americans, both in reviews and in reference to her characters' titles within such films.&lt;ref name="BigShow"/&gt; [[Peter Milne (screenwriter)|Peter Milne]], a film critic and eventual screenwriter, berated Deveraux for her age and appearance, calling her "ancient" in his review of ''Mickey''; Devereaux was only 27 years old at the time of the film's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Milne| first = Peter| title = The Screen in Review| newspaper = Picture-Play Magazine| pages = 126|date=September 1918| url = https://archive.org/stream/pictureplaymagaz09unse#page/n457/mode/2up/|archiveurl = https://archive.org| archivedate =1993| accessdate =November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in ''[[Photoplay]]'' details an encounter between Devereaux and a belligerent white woman. On a crowded street car, the woman intentionally took up available space in order to prevent Devereaux from sitting nearby. Devereaux interrupted the conductor of the street car, who insisted that the woman move her belongings, saying that she would rather stand than to sit next to such a woman.&lt;ref name="BigShow"/&gt;

Despite this unease, many in the film business were aware of, and respected Devereaux's wit, dignity, and talents as an actress. [[Motion Picture Magazine]] recounts a chance encounter between Devereaux and actor [[Bertram Grassby]], who commented on the actress' persona:&lt;ref name="DryadicDramatist"&gt;{{Citation| last = Trepel| first = Beth| title = A Dryadic Dramatist| newspaper = Motion Picture Magazine| pages = 77|date=August 1911| url = https://archive.org/stream/motionpicturemag20brew#page/77/mode/1up/|archiveurl = https://archive.org| archivedate =July 24, 2014| accessdate =November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|During the conversation, the name of Minnie, a fat, old Indian woman who has almost become a moving picture institution, was mentioned and he commented laughingly on her way of always saying and doing the unexpected thing.|Beth Trepel|"A Dryadic Dramatist"|''Motion Picture Magazine''}} The encounter involved Grassby tipping his hat toward Devereaux, which prompted her to question the meaning of the act.&lt;ref name="DryadicDramatist"/&gt; Devereaux often poked fun at other actors, and at directors during the production of a film.&lt;ref name="BigShow"/&gt;

'''Mladen Milovanović''' (c. 1760 in [[Botunje]] near [[Kragujevac]] – 1823 in [[Zlatibor]]) was a merchant, a [[Voivode]] in the [[First Serbian Uprising]], associate of Karađorđe and leader of his party, [[List of Prime Ministers of Serbia|President of the Administering Council]] (1807–1810 and 1813–1814) and first Serbian [[Minister of Defence (Serbia)|Minister of Defence]] (1811–1813).

==Biography==
Mladen was of [[Drobnjak clan]] ancestry.

He was very selfish, acquisitive, and resolute, very skilful schemer. He had a strong influence on the [[Karađorđe|Karadjordje]]. He was blamed for the defeat of Serbian forces in East in 1809, and change the war plan contributed to the collapse of the rebellion in 1813. After the defeat of [[Serbia]], he went abroad, and in 1814 arrived in [[Khotyn|Hotin]], [[Russian Empire]], where he remained until 1821.

He was killed in 1823, while crossing over the [[Zlatibor]] and on the road to [[Montenegro]], by order of Prince [[Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia|Milos Obrenovic]], who had never trusted him. In April 1823, Prince Milos gave in [[Kragujevac]] order to Serdar of Zlatibor [[Jovan Micic]] to escort Milovanovic to [[Lim (river)|Lim]], and transfer him to Montenegro. However, Micic guys Leko and Simo Kovac killed him in the Očka mountain on Zlatibor during alleged escape attempt by Milovanovic, and his body dumped in a nearby cave Zvekara.

'''Mog''' (1663-1724), also called "Chief" Mog, Heracouansit, Warracansit, Warracunsit, or Warrawcuset, was an [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] war leader who fought the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] in North America during the early 18th century.

== Biography ==
Mog was the son of Mog, a previous leader of the Abenaki, who was killed in 1677. Mog fought in [[King William's War]] and [[Queen Anne's War]] as an ally of [[New France]], returning British scalps to Quebec in exchange for payment. After the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], Mog was forced to capitulate, giving the British free passage through their territory. Peace was ended in 1722 when a few Abenaki males attacked Massachusetts, and the [[Colony of Massachusetts]] declared war on the Abenaki. Alongside Father [[Sebastien Rale]] and [[Bomoseen]], he was killed in the [[Battle of Norridgewock]], shot by a Mohawk soldier allied to the British after failing to kill his son with a musket.

'''Moshe Alshich''' {{lang-he-n|משה אלשיך}}, also spelled Alshech, (1508–1593), known as the ''Alshich Hakadosh (the Holy)'', was a prominent [[rabbi]], preacher, and [[Bible|biblical]] commentator in the latter part of the 16th century.

The Alshich was born in 1508 in the [[Ottoman Empire]], and was the son of Hayyim Alshich. He later moved to Safed where he became a student of Rabbi [[Yosef Karo|Joseph Caro]]. His students included Rabbi [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital|Hayim Vital]] and Rabbi [[Yom Tov Tzahalon]]. He died in Safed in 1593.

== Significance ==
Only a few rabbis were granted the title "''Hakadosh''" throughout Jewish history. Alongside the Alshich were the ''[[Isaiah Horowitz|Shelah HaKadosh]]'', the ''[[Isaac Luria|Ari HaKadosh]]'' and the ''[[Chaim ibn Attar|Ohr HaChaim HaKadosh]]'', all of them distinctive personalities in their times.&lt;ref name="Zimmels1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hirsch Jakob Zimmels|title=Ashkenazim and Sephardim: their relations, differences, and problems as reflected in the rabbinical responsa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Svzf3uUCFToC&amp;pg=PA264|accessdate=7 September 2011|date=1 December 1993|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|pages=264, note 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various reasons have been suggested as to why the Alshich received the "''Hakadosh''" title.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, {{cite web |url=http://www.safed-kabbalah.com/Sages/MosheAlshich.1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308190916/http://www.safed-kabbalah.com/Sages/MosheAlshich.1.htm |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[homiletic]]al commentaries on the [[Torah]] and the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]] enjoy much popularity and are still studied today, largely because of their powerful influence as practical exhortations to virtuous life.

== Life ==
He was a disciple of R. [[Yosef Karo|Joseph Caro]], author of the "[[Shulchan Aruch]]"; and his own disciples included the Kabbalist R. [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital|Hayim Vital]]. Although the Alshich belonged to the circle of the Kabbalists who lived at Safed, his works rarely betray any traces of the [[Kabbalah]]. He is celebrated as a teacher, preacher, and casuist.

Little is known of his life. In his works he avoids mention of himself, telling only of his course of study; thus in the preface to his commentary on the Pentateuch he says:

{{cquote|I never aimed at things too high or beyond me. From my earliest days the study of the [[Talmud]] was my chief occupation, and I assiduously attended the [[yeshiva]]h where I made myself familiar with the discussions of [[Abaye]] and [[Rava (amora)|Raba]]. The night I devoted to research and the day to [[Halakha]]. In the morning I read the Talmud and in the afternoon the [[Posek]]im (Rabbinic legal decisions). Only on Fridays could I find time for the reading of Scripture and [[Midrash]] in preparation for my lectures on the Sidra of the week and similar topics, which I delivered every Sabbath before large audiences, eager to listen to my instruction.}}

Legend has it that his son was taken as a child and became a Moslem, and the [[Arizal]] authored a special prayer for the son's return.

== Works ==
These lectures were afterward published as "Commentaries" (perushim) on the books of the Holy Scriptures, and Alshich gives a remarkable reason for their publication: "Many of those who had listened to my lectures repeated them partly or wholly in their own names. These offenses will be prevented by the publication of my own work". These lectures, though somewhat lengthy, were not tedious to his audience. The author repeatedly declares that in their printed form (as "Commentaries") he greatly curtailed them by omitting everything which was not absolutely necessary, or which he had already mentioned in another place.

Like [[Isaac Abrabanel|Abravanel]] and some other commentators, Alshich headed each section of his comments with a number of questions which he anticipated on the part of the reader; he then proceeded to give a summary of his view, and concluded with answering all the questions seriatim. His Commentaries abound in references to [[Talmud]], [[Midrash]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliyahu Munk]] (Translated and edited by) ''Midrash of Rabbi Moshe Alshich on the Torah (Vol 1-2-3)'', [[Lambda Publishers]], Inc. [[Jerusalem]]/[[New York City|New York]], 2000 {{ISBN|965-7108-13-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Zohar]], but contain scant references to other commentaries, such as the works of Abravanel, [[Gersonides|R. Levi ben Gershon]] or [[Maimonides]]. His explanations are all of a homiletical character; his sole object being to find in each sentence or in each word of the Scriptures a moral lesson, a support for trust in God, encouragement to patient endurance, and a proof of the vanity of all earthly goods as compared with the everlasting bliss to be acquired in the future life. He frequently and earnestly appeals to his brethren, exhorting them to repent, and to abandon, or at least restrict, the pursuit of all worldly pleasures, and thus accelerate the approach of the Messianic era. Alshich possessed an easy and fluent style; his expositions are mostly of an allegorical character, but very rarely approach mysticism. In his commentary on the [[Song of Solomon]], he calls ''peshaִt'' (literal explanation) and ''sod'' (mystical interpretation) the two opposite extremes, while he declares his own method of introducing allegorical exposition to be the safe mean between these extremes. Alshich wrote the following commentaries, most of which have appeared in several editions:

#"Torat Mosheh" (Commentary on the [[Pentateuch]]), first ed. [[Belvedere, Turkey|Belvedere]] near Constantinople, about 1593. Complete, with Indexes, Venice, 1601.
#An abstract of this commentary was prepared by [[Jos. b. Aryeh Loeb]], and has appeared in various forms (entitled: "Qitsur Alshich 'al ha-Torah"), Amsterdam, 1748.
#"Marot ha-Tsobeot" (Collected Visions), on the prophets and their prophecies, Venice, 1803-7.
#Extracts from this commentary are included in "Minhah Qe'tannah," a commentary on the earlier prophets; published in the [[Biblia Rabbinica]] (Qohelet Mosheh), Amsterdam, 1724.
#"Romemot El" (Praises of God), on the book of Psalms, Venice, 1605.
#"Rab Peninim" (Multitude of Pearls), on Proverbs, Venice, 1601.
#"Helqat Mehoqeq" (The Lawgiver's Portion), on Job, Venice, 1603.
#"Shoshanat ha-'Amaqim" (Lily of the Valleys), on the [[Song of Solomon]]. This commentary was the first to appear in print, and was edited by Alshich himself in 1591. According to this commentary, the Song is an [[allegory]], and represents a dialogue between God and exiled Israel on the latter's mission.
#"'Ene Mosheh" (Eyes of Moses), on Ruth. Alshich says of the [[book of Ruth]], "Surely from it we might take a lesson how to serve God"; and illustrates this statement throughout his commentary, Venice, 1601.
#"Devarim Nihumim" (Comforting Words), on the "[[Lamentations of Jeremiah]]". The title is not merely a euphemism for Lamentations; the author repeatedly attempts to show that there is no cause for despair, God being with Israel, and though the Temple is destroyed the Shekinah has not departed from the [[Western Wall]], Venice, 1601.
#"Devarim Tovim" (Good Words), on [[Ecclesiastes]]. Alshich calls [[Ecclesiastes]], on account of its deep thoughts, "Waters without end" (oceans). He endeavors in the commentary to illustrate, as the central idea of the book, the dictum, "All is vain, except the fear of the Lord, which is the essential condition of man's real existence," Venice, 1601.
#"Massat Mosheh" (Moses' Gift), on the [[book of Esther]], presented by the author to his brethren as a Purim gift, Venice, 1601.
#The commentaries of Alshich on these last-named five books ("[[megillot]]", "scrolls") appeared in an abridged form, edited by [[Eleazer b. Hananiah Tarnigrad]], Amsterdam, 1697.
#"Habatselet ha-Sharon" (The Rose of Sharon), on the book of Daniel, Safed, 1563, and Venice, 1592.
#A commentary on the "Hafִtarot" called "Liqqute Man" (Gatherings of Manna), was compiled chiefly from "Marot ha-Tsobeot," by E. M. Markbreit, Amsterdam, 1704.
#"Yarim Mosheh" is the title of a commentary on [[Abot]], gathered from the works of Alshich by Joseph B. M. Schlenker, Fürth, 1764.
#A commentary of Alshich on the [[Haggadah]] (Home Service for the first nights of Passover) appears in the edition of the Haggadah called "Bet Horim" (House of Free Men). The commentary is full of interesting remarks and earnest exhortations (Metz, 1767). Even in the introduction the laws for Passover and the order for the evening are treated allegorically, and made the vehicle for religious meditation. It is, however, not likely that Alshich wrote these notes for the Haggadah. They were probably gathered from his works long after his death, as otherwise the Haggadah would have been published with his commentary much earlier.
#"[[Responsa]]"; as a casuist he was frequently consulted by other rabbis, and his decisions were collected in a volume of responsa (Venice, 1605; Berlin, 1766). His contemporaries frequently quote his opinions. During his lifetime [[Azariah dei Rossi]] produced his "Meor 'Enayim" (Light for the Eyes), in which the author rejected some beliefs generally received as traditional; Alshich, at the request of his teacher, R. [[Joseph Caro]], wrote a declaration against the "Meor 'Enayim" as being contrary and dangerous to the Jewish religion (''Kerem Chemed'', v. 141).
#Alshich wrote also a poem, "[[Dirge]] on the Exile of Israel," in a very simple style in ten rhyming verses. It has been introduced into various earlier morning rituals, such as "Ayelet ha-Shachar" (The Morning Dawn). It is also contained in the collection of prayers and hymns called "Sha'are Zion" (The Gates of Zion).

==Ministry of Defence==
Pope joined the Ministry of Defence in 1985.  After serving in a number of different posts, he was assigned in 1991 to a section of Secretariat (Air Staff) known as Sec (AS) 2a, where his duties included investigating reports of UFO sightings, to see if they had any defence significance.

At the time, while the Ministry of Defence stated that it "remains totally open-minded about the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial lifeforms", it also stated that there was no evidence to suggest that any UFO sightings posed any threat to the UK or that they were extraterrestrial in origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/07B4C36A-708E-4C59-9A2B-0756E960CF35/0/ufos1104.pdf|title=Ministry of Defence policy statement on UFOs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear from material that Pope wrote whilst still at the MoD that he did not share the MoD's view that conventional explanations could be found for all UFO sightings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/DefencePolicyAndBusiness/TheOfficialWhoWantsToBelieve.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060611143759/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/DefencePolicyAndBusiness/TheOfficialWhoWantsToBelieve.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-06-11|title=Defence|work=nationalarchives.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope's final posting in the MoD was to the Directorate of Defence Security.  He resigned in 2006 and in 2009 MoD announced that UFO sightings would no longer be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FreedomOfInformation/PublicationScheme/SearchPublicationScheme/HowToReportAUfoSighting.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091204113019/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FreedomOfInformation/PublicationScheme/SearchPublicationScheme/HowToReportAUfoSighting.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-12-04|title=Ministry of Defence - Freedom of Information - Publication Scheme - Search Publication Scheme - How to report a UFO sighting|work=nationalarchives.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/ufo/6723067/MoD-department-that-investigated-UFO-sightings-closed.html|title=MoD department that investigated UFO sightings ‘closed’|date=4 December 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/04/ufo-ministry-of-defence|title=How not to report a UFO|author=Nick Pope|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anak Agung Pandji Tisna''' (11 February 1908 – 2 June 1978), also known as '''Anak Agung Nyoman Pandji Tisna''', '''I Gusti Nyoman Pandji Tisna''', or just '''Pandji Tisna''', was the 11th descendent of the Pandji Sakti dynasty of [[Buleleng]], [[Singaraja]], which is in the northern part of [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]]. He succeeded his father, Anak Agung Putu Djelantik, in 1944.

On the last page of Pandji Tisna's book, ''I Made Widiadi'', written in 1955, he wrote his life story in chronological order. He was a writer and a novelist. He refused to be the king of Buleleng, but being the eldest son, the Japanese occupancy troops forced him to be "syucho" after the death of his father in 1944.

During his reign, he became the leader of the Council of Kings of all of Bali from 1946 to 1947 (''Paruman Agung'') and the [[Regencies of Indonesia|Regent]] of [[Buleleng]]. In 1947, because his uniquely [[Christian]] faith did not fit in with the predominant Hindu religion, Pandji Tisna surrendered the throne to his younger brother, Anak Agung Ngurah Ketut Djelantik or I Gusti Ketut Djelantik, also known as Meester Djelantik, until 1949.

He died 2 June 1978 and was buried in the graveyard on the Eastside of his land near the chapel he built years before.

==Early years==
Anak Agung Pandji Tisna was born to [[Putu Djelantik|Anak Agung Putu Djelantik]] and his wife Jero Mekele Rengga.

Pandji Tisna received his formal education in a primary school in Singaraja and continued his education in a middle school in [[Jakarta|Batavia]].

==Career==
Pandji Tisna is best known as a novelist. His novels, which all took place in Bali, especially in Singaraja, his birthplace,{{clarify|date=November 2010}}&lt;!--Is the setting in Bali or were they written in Bali?--&gt; were published by [[Balai Pustaka]]. Many of his short stories were published in ''Terang Bulan'' magazine in Surabaya. He also took the time to write poems, such as ''Ni Poetri'', which was published by [[Sutan Takdir Alisyahbana]] in ''[[Poedjangga Baroe]]'' magazine in Jakarta.

Pandji Tisna had a varied career as a merchant, secretary to his father, Headmaster of Elementary School, Editor of Jatayu magazine, and farmer, before succeeding to the throne on the death of his father on 25 July 1944. He was Chair of the Balinese Council of Kings from 1946–1947, but abdicated in favour of his brother, Meester Djelantik, in 1947.

He was a member of the Provisional Parliament of the State of East Indonesia from 1946-1948.

==Development of the Balinese tourist industry==
Pandji Tisna is also remembered as a pioneer of Balinese [[tourism]], especially in the northern beach district. In 1953, he chose Desa Tukad Cebol (now Desa Kaliasem [Kaliasem Village]) as his holiday home. There he wrote and received both local and foreign guests. He named his holiday home ''[[Lovina]]'', which is an abbreviation of words ''Love Indonesia''. He then built several guest houses in the western coast in Buleleng. The whole area then became known as ''Pantai Lovina'', or ''Lovina Beach'' in English. For this reason, he is accredited as "The Father of Balinese Tourism". In 2003, the Balinese government posthumously awarded him the Karya Karana Award in recognition of his services to the development of Balinese tourism.

==Family==
Pandji Tisna had four wives, Anak Agung Istri Manik, with whom he had two sons; Ni Ketut Mayas (Jero Mekele Seroja), with whom he had two sons and 1 daughter; Luh Sayang (Mekele Sadpada), with whom he had two sons ; and Jro Mekele Resmi, with whom he had 4 sons and two daughters.

'''Pasteur Bizimungu''' (born 1950) was the third [[President of Rwanda]], holding office from 19 July 1994 until 23 March 2000.

== Early life ==
A [[Rwanda]]n, Bizimingu was born in the [[Gisenyi]] prefecture of Rwanda.&lt;ref name=BBC76 /&gt; According to the academic Filip Reyntjens, Bizimungu had ties to radical anti-Tutsi groups as a student in the 1970s, but later joined the RPF. He served as President of Rwanda after the 1994 genocide.

== Relationship to MRND ==
In the 1980s and '90s, Bizimungu worked within the Hutu [[Mouvement républicain national pour la démocratie et le développement|MRND]] government which ruled Rwanda until 1994. Prior to 1990, Bizimungu had close ties to Hutu president [[Juvénal Habyarimana]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/20/world/the-three-victors-who-will-lead-rwanda.html |title=The Three Victors Who Will Lead Rwanda |date=20 July 1994 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he held several positions, including director-general of Electrogaz, the national electricity company.&lt;ref name=BBC76 /&gt;

In 1990 he joined the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) after his brother, a colonel in the [[Rwandan Armed Forces]], was murdered.&lt;ref name=BBC233&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/688587.stm |title=Analysis: Why Bizimungu mattered |date=23 March 2008 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the RPF was just beginning its invasion of Rwanda from Uganda, starting the [[Rwandan Civil War]].&lt;ref name=BBC76 /&gt; Bizimungu lived in exile in Belgium, serving as the party's information officer.&lt;ref name=R64 /&gt; In 1993, he helped negotiate the 1993 [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]].&lt;ref name=BBC76 /&gt;

After Habyarimana's death in a plane crash on 6 April 1994, ethnic extremists unleashed the [[Rwandan genocide]].

== Presidency ==
In July 1994 the RPF gained control of the country and established a national unity government. The ''de facto'' RPF leader, [[Paul Kagame]], was chosen as vice president, and Bizimungu became president.

During Bizimungu's administration, many believed that he was merely a figurehead, and Kagame held the real power.&lt;ref name=BBC233 /&gt; Bizimungu soon found himself in conflict with Kagame over what Bizimungu argued was unjustified repression of dissent.&lt;ref name=BBC76 /&gt; Critics accused Bizimungu of corruption, alleging that he had blocked Parliament's attempts to censure corrupt ministers, refused to pay compensation to evicted residents on one of his building sites, and dodged Rwandan taxes by registering two of his trucks in the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;ref name=BBC233 /&gt;

Bizimungu resigned in March 2000 in a dispute over the make-up of a new cabinet, and Kagame became president.&lt;ref name=R64/&gt;

== Party for Democratic Renewal ==
In May 2001, Bizimungu founded a new political party, the [[Party for Democratic Renewal (Rwanda)|Party for Democratic Renewal]] (PDR), known as Ubuyanja in [[Kinyarwanda]]. It was almost immediately banned by the government, which accused it of being a radical Hutu party. Bizimungu was arrested, and [[Amnesty International]] named him a [[prisoner of conscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr47/002/2002/en/ |title=Rwanda: Number of prisoners of conscience on the rise |date=7 June 2002 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=22 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was placed under [[house arrest]] for continuing the operations of the party on 19 April 2002 and charged with endangering the state. On 7 June 2004 he was sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempting to form a militia, inciting violence, and embezzlement. He received a five-year sentence for each of these convictions, which were to run consecutively.&lt;ref name=BBC76&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3728807.stm |title=From president to prison |date=7 June 2004 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2006, Bizimungu's appeal, based on the fact that he was convicted of crimes different from those with which he was initially charged, was denied by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4724338.stm |title=Rwanda's ex-leader loses appeal |date=17 February 2006 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was released on 6 April 2007, having been pardoned by Kagame. Kagame gave no explanation of the pardon.&lt;ref name=R64&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/04/06/uk-rwanda-president-idUKL0649673220070406 |title=Rwanda's ex-president freed from prison |author=Arthur Asiimwe |date=6 April 2007  |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2011, PDR co-founder and later co-defendant [[Charles Ntakirutinka]] remained in prison, and was named an Amnesty International "priority case."&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/individuals-at-risk/priority-cases/rwanda-charles-ntakirutinka/page.do?id=1510032 |title=Charles Ntakirutinka, prisoner of conscience |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429082855/http://www.amnestyusa.org/individuals-at-risk/priority-cases/rwanda-charles-ntakirutinka/page.do?id=1510032 |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bizimungu's wife is Séraphine Utamuliza. He has one son, and two daughters, Alexander Tabara, Nicole Tamara, and Carine Cyuzuzo. &lt;ref name=BBC76 /&gt;

'''Patrizio Bosti''' ([[Naples]], September 5, 1959) is a powerful Italian [[Camorra]] boss and head of the [[Bosti clan]], a Camorra crime syndicate based in the city of Naples. His nickname is ''"'o Patrizio"''. Bosti and his clan are aligned with the long established Licciardi and Contini Camorra clans. The power, influence and wealth his clan held allowed Bosti to become one of the top Camorra leaders within the [[Secondigliano Alliance]] (''Alleanza di Secondigliano'') of leading Naples area clans. Bosti was included on the [[list of most wanted fugitives in Italy]] and had been a fugitive from 2005, but was eventually arrested on August 10, 2008, in [[Girona]], [[Spain]]. He was spotted when he took a flight from [[Naples]] to [[Barcelona]] a week before and traced to nearby Girona, where he was spending some time in a luxurious villa. Bosti was convicted in absentia of heading a clan of the Naples-based Camorra crime syndicate and sentenced to 23 years in prison for the murder of two rival mobsters during a feud in 1984. He was later extradited to Italy to face the murder charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadaeast.com/news/article/379946 Fugitive Italian mobster Patrizio Bosti arrested in northeastern Spain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastottawa.ca/article-cp108958041-Fugitive-Italian-mobster-Patrizio-Bosti-arrested-in-northeastern-Spain.html Fugitive Italian mobster Patrizio Bosti arrested in northeastern Spain]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Philip Francis''' (22 October 1740 – 23 December 1818) was an [[Kingdom of Ireland|Irish]]-born [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] politician and pamphleteer, the supposed author of the ''Letters'' of [[Junius]], and the chief antagonist of [[Warren Hastings]]. His accusations against the latter led to the [[impeachment of Warren Hastings]] and [[Elijah Impey]] by Parliament. He belonged to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] party.

==Early life==
Born in [[Dublin]], he was the only son of [[Philip Francis (translator)|Dr Philip Francis]] (c. 1708–1773), a man of some literary celebrity in his time, known by his translations of [[Horace]], [[Aeschines]] and [[Demosthenes]]. He received the rudiments of an excellent education at a free school in [[Dublin]], and afterwards spent a year or two (1751–1752) under his father's roof at [[Skeyton]] [[Rectory]], Norfolk, and elsewhere, and for a short time he had [[Edward Gibbon]] as a fellow-pupil. In March 1753, he entered [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's school, London]], where he remained for three and a half years, becoming a proficient classical scholar.

In 1756, immediately on his leaving school, he was appointed to a junior clerkship in the secretary of state's office by [[Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland|Henry Fox]] (afterwards [[Baron Holland|Lord Holland]]), with whose family Dr Francis was at that time on intimate terms; and this post he retained under the succeeding administration. In 1758 he was employed as secretary to [[Thomas Bligh|General Bligh]] in the [[raid on Cherbourg|expedition against Cherbourg]]; and in the same capacity he accompanied [[Thomas Hay, 9th Earl of Kinnoull|the Earl of Kinnoull]] on [[British Ambassador to Portugal|his special embassy]] to the court of [[Portugal]] in 1760.

==He starts to rise==
In 1761, he became personally known to [[William Pitt the Elder]] who, recognising his ability and discretion, made use of his services as private amanuensis from time to time. In 1762 he was appointed to a principal clerkship in the war office, where he formed a warm friendship with Christopher D'Oyly, Deputy-Secretary at War, whose dismissal from office in 1772 was hotly resented by Junius. On 27 February 1762 he married Elizabeth Macrabie, the daughter of a retired London merchant. His daughter, Catherine Francis (d. 11 Sep 1823) married [[Cholmondeley_(surname)|George James Cholmondeley]] (b. 22 Feb 1752, d. 5 Nov 1830).&lt;ref&gt;Mosley, Charles, editor. Burke's Peerage, Baronetage &amp; Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes. Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

His official duties brought him into direct relations with many who were well versed in the politics of the time. In 1763 the great constitutional questions arising out of the arrest of Wilkes began to be sharply canvassed. It was natural that Francis, who from a very early age had been in the habit of writing occasionally to the newspapers, should be eager to take an active part in the discussion, though his position as a government official made it necessary that his intervention should be carefully disguised.

==Time moves on==
[[File:DUEL BETWEEN WARREN HASTINGS AND PHILIP FRANCIS..gif|thumb|Duel between Warren Hastings and Philip Francis.]]
He is known to have written to the ''Public Ledger'' and ''Public Advertiser'', as an advocate of the popular cause, on many occasions about and after the year 1763; he frequently attended debates in both Houses of Parliament, especially when American questions were being discussed; and between 1769 and 1771 he is also known to have been favourable to the scheme for the overthrow of the [[Augustus Henry Fitzroy, 3rd Duke of Grafton|Grafton]] government and afterwards of that of Lord North, and for persuading or forcing Lord Chatham into power. In January 1769 the first of the [[Letters of Junius]] appeared, and the series continued till 21 January 1772. They had been preceded by others under signatures such as "Candor", "Father of Candor", "[[Anti-Sejanus]]", "Lucius", and "Nemesis".

The [[Identity of Junius|authorship of the letters]] has been assigned to Francis on a variety of grounds, including a computer-aided analysis of the Junius texts in the 1960s. Comparing stylistic patterns from the letters with attributed writings of the period allowed a reasonable statistical conclusion to be drawn that Francis was by far the most likely author. Some evidence to support the claim of Sir Philip Francis is given in Macaulay's History of England&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, Thomas Babbington. A History of England 2,17,pp. 849,Dent Dutton 1906&lt;/ref&gt; in which Macaulay mentions the likely reference to [[Henry Luttrell (Jacobite commander)|Henry Luttrell]], who although obscure to the British of the 1770s, would have been well known to the Irish and particularly to Sir Philip Francis who spent the early part of his life near Luttrellstown.

In March 1772 Francis finally left the war office, and in July of the same year he left England for a tour through France, Germany and Italy, which lasted until the following December. On his return he was contemplating emigration to New England, when in June 1773 Lord North, on the recommendation of Lord Barrington, appointed him a member of the newly constituted supreme council of [[Bengal]] at a salary of 10,000 pounds per annum. Along with his colleagues Monson and Clavering he reached [[Calcutta]] in October 1774, and a long struggle with [[Warren Hastings]], the governor-general, immediately began. These three, actuated probably by petty personal motives, combined to form a majority of the council in harassing opposition to the governor-general's policy; and they even accused him of corruption, mainly on the evidence of [[Nuncomar]].

The death of [[Baron Monson|Monson]] in 1776, and of [[John Clavering (British Army officer)|Clavering]] in the following year, made Hastings again supreme in the council. But a dispute with Francis, more than usually embittered, led in August 1780 to a minute being delivered to the council board by Hastings, in which he stated that he judged of the public conduct of Mr Francis by his experience of his private, which he had found to be "void of truth and honor"; such an opinion was aggravated by the various affairs Francis had during his stay in Calcutta, including one with [[Catherine Grand]]. A [[duel]] was the consequence, in which Francis received a dangerous wound. Though his recovery was rapid and complete, he did not choose to prolong his stay abroad. He arrived in England in October 1781, and was received with little favour.

Little is known of the nature of his occupations during the next two years (went to Tibet?), except that he was untiring in his efforts to procure first the recall, and afterwards the impeachment, of his hitherto triumphant adversary. In 1783 Fox produced his India Bill, which led to the overthrow of the coalition government. In 1784 Francis was returned to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] as Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of [[Yarmouth (Isle of Wight) (UK Parliament constituency)|Yarmouth, Isle of Wight]]; and although he took an opportunity to disclaim every feeling of personal animosity towards Hastings, this did not prevent him, on the return of the latter in 1785, from doing all in his power to bring forward and support the charges which ultimately led to the [[impeachment]] resolutions of 1787. Although excluded by a majority of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] from the list of the managers of that impeachment, Francis was nonetheless its most energetic promoter, supplying his friends [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan]] with all the materials for their eloquent orations and burning invectives.

At the general election of 1790 he was returned member for [[Bletchingley (UK Parliament constituency)|Bletchingley]]. He sympathised warmly and actively with the French revolutionary doctrines, expostulating with Burke on his vehement denunciation of the same. In 1793 he supported [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]]'s motion for a return to the old constitutional system of representation, and so earned the title to be regarded as one of the earliest promoters of the cause of parliamentary reform; and he was one of the founders of the [[Society of the Friends of the People]].

==Later life==
The acquittal of Hastings in April 1795 disappointed Francis of the governor-generalship, and in 1798 he had to submit to the additional mortification of a defeat in the general election. He was once more successful, however, in 1802, when he sat for [[Appleby (UK Parliament constituency)|Appleby]], and it seemed as if the great ambitions of his life were about to be realised when the Whig party came into power in 1806. His disappointment was great when the governor-generalship was, owing to party exigencies, conferred on [[Gilbert Elliot, 1st Earl of Minto|Sir Gilbert Elliot]] (Lord Minto); he declined, it is said, soon afterwards the government of the Cape, but accepted a [[Order of the Bath|KB]]. Though re-elected for Appleby in 1806, he failed to secure a seat in the following year; and the remainder of his life was spent in comparative privacy.

Among the later productions of his pen were, besides the Plan of a Reform in the Election of the House of Commons, pamphlets entitled:

*''Proceedings in the House of Commons on the Slave Trade'' (1796),
*''Reflections on the Abundance of Paper in Circulation and the Scarcity of Specie'' (1810),
*''Historical Questions Exhibited'' (1818), and a
*''Letter to Earl Grey on the Policy of Great Britain and the Allies towards Norway'' (1814).

His first wife, by whom he had six children, died in 1806, and in 1814 he married his second wife, Emma Watkins, who long survived him, and who left voluminous manuscripts relating to his biography. In his domestic relations he was exemplary, and he lived on terms of mutual affection with a wide circle of friends.

'''Raynor Carey Johnson''' (1901–1987) was an English [[Parapsychology|parapsychologist]], [[physicist]] and author.

==Life and career==

Johnson was born in [[Leeds]], England. He earned an MA at the [[University of Oxford]] and a PhD in physics at the [[University of London]]. He published scientific works on [[spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name="Parnaby2007"&gt;Owen Parnaby. (2007). [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/johnson-raynor-carey-12700 "Johnson, Raynor Carey (1901–1987)"]. Australian Dictionary of Biography.&lt;/ref&gt;

He became increasingly interested in parapsychology and became connected with the [[Society for Psychical Research]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/raynor-johnson "Raynor Carey Johnson"], ''Gale Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's religious background led to work in Australia, where he was master of the [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[Queen's College (University of Melbourne)|Queen's College]] at the [[University of Melbourne]] from 1934 to 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unimelb.edu.au/unisec/calendar/headscolleges.html "Former Heads of Colleges"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101233059/http://www.unimelb.edu.au/unisec/calendar/headscolleges.html |date=1 January 2008 }}. The University of Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson published several books on [[mysticism]] and [[parapsychology|psychical research]] during the 1950s and 1960s. His beliefs and writings eventually created concern within the Methodist Church and he retired from his university position in 1964. In the early 1960s Johnson visited India, where he met [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] and lectured on spirituality. He also met the Indian mystics [[Vinoba Bhave]] and Swami Pratyagatmananda.&lt;ref name="Parnaby2007"/&gt;

Johnson was an advocate of Douglas Fawcett's philosophy of Imaginism which he believed could explain [[God]] and the purpose of human life.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ashby. (1972). ''The Guidebook for the Study of Psychical Research''. p. 83. {{ISBN|0-09-113901-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He owned a property called "''Santiniketan''" ("abode of peace") at [[Ferny Creek, Victoria|Ferny Creek]] in the [[Dandenong Ranges]] outside Melbourne. There he hosted regular meetings of a religious and philosophical discussion group led by the [[yoga]] teacher Anne Hamilton-Byrne. This group became known as "[[The Family (Australian New Age group)|The Family]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Supreme Court of Victoria]] 1999 Judgement in [http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid='JUD/*1999*1VR861/00002' ''Kibby v.

Johnson died in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19870518&amp;id=6OwxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dJIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6531,5060160 "Raynor Johnson Dies"]. ''[[The Age]]''. 18 May 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty years after his death, an authorised biography was published, ''Raynor Johnson – A Biographical Memoir'' (2007). Two further books authored by Johnson were published after his death – ''Mysticism and Life'' (2010) and a collection of miscellaneous writings, ''A Late Lark Singing'' (2012).

==Reception==

Johnson in his book ''Psychical Research'' endorsed psychical and [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] phenomena and cited reports by the [[Society for Psychical Research]]. In a review, M. Steinbach for ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]'' wrote that although Johnson was "quite earnest and certainly sincere in completely accepting the whole range of spiritualist phenomena", many of the cases he described could be easily be explained by [[coincidence]], delusion, [[hallucination]], [[suggestion]] and that most of the mediums were exposed as fraudulent.&lt;ref name="Steinbach1957"&gt;M. Steinbach. (1957). ''Psychical Research. by R. C. Johnson''. ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]''. Vol. 32, No. 3. pp. 318-319.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson believed that the material world was a creation of the mind, in the book he claimed paranormal phenomena such as discarnate minds, [[mediumship]], psi and [[telepathy]] could be explained by a "psychic ether". On this, Steinbach wrote "but to do that is to leave this world of reality and the firm basis of scientific thought for a speculative journey in an imaginary vehicle to a never-never-land."&lt;ref name="Steinbach1957"/&gt;

Johnson's ''Nurslings of Immortality'' received a mixed review in ''[[The Journal of Religion]]'', William Hamilton wrote that the book endorsed a "pretentious philosophical quasi-idealism" called Imaginism but contained some interesting material about [[automatic writing]] and psychic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;William Hamilton. (1959). ''Nurslings of Immortality by Raynor C. Johnson''. ''[[The Journal of Religion]]''. Vol. 39, No. 4. p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Blue Paint Killer''' is a fictional character featured in the third and fifth season of the [[CBS]] drama ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]''. He was portrayed by Taylor Nichols.

==Victims==
* Janet Kent (1987) – an art student who was taught by, and dated, Cody Lewis
* Marcia Reese (1987) – another student at WLVU
* Charlene Roth (1988) – killed by John Mathers, who was executed 15 years later
* Debbie Reston (2002) – killed on the day of John Mathers' execution
* Jonathan Avery Haywood (III) (2004) – killed by mistake due to resemblance to Kaitlin Rackish
* Kaitlin Rackish (2004) – a student of Cody Lewis

==Modus operandi==
The killer applies blue house paint to railings in the fictional Western Las Vegas University campus; he chooses the railings because they are near a water fountain. [[Motor oil]] is mixed into the paint to slow the drying process. He waits for the female victim to touch the railing and then, with the victim attempting to wash the paint off her hand at the water fountain, he attacks her, binds and gags her, bundles her into a van and drives away from the site. He then stops the van outside an erotic boutique and sketches while his victim pleads for mercy. He draws her while he sits in the driver's seat looking at her through the rear view mirror as she struggles in the back. He then [[sexually assault]]s her before strangling her to death. After he kills his victim, he dumps her, in a black garbage bag, around [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and sells his sketches to the owner of the boutique.

The exception to this M.O. is Jonathan Avery Haywood III, killed in "[[What's Eating Gilbert Grissom?]]". As Haywood is mistaken for Kaitlin Rackish, the killer does not assault or sketch him and disposes of the body by feeding it into a [[wood chipper]] on campus.

==Suspects==

===John Mathers===
[[Image:JohnMathersMugshot.jpg|thumb|John Mathers, from his police mugshot (Capt. [[Jim Brass]] standing to the left)]]
John Mathers was a security guard who worked at WLVU in 1987, when the killings began. He was arrested and convicted in 1988 after one of his hairs was found on Charlene Roth's body. He remains on [[Death Row]] for 15 years, until he is executed for Charlene Roth's murder ("[[The Execution of Catherine Willows]]"). However, another victim (Debbie Reston) is found on the day of the execution. Believing Mathers to be a copycat of the real killer, the CSIs tried to find the real culprit; due to a lack of evidence, however, the case goes cold.

Following another pair of murders in "[[What's Eating Gilbert Grissom?]]", it transpires that Mathers and Greer are partners. They are clearly quite close, with Greer referring to his partner as "JM", although he also says that capture and execution is "the price you pay for being incompetent". It is assumed that Mathers is later posthumously pardoned for Charlene Roth's murder{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}, as [[Gil Grissom]] determines that Kevin Greer is the "alpha male" of the two partners, and Mathers only assaulted the first three victims, although he is not convicted of the murders of Janet Kent and Marcia Reese.

===Cody Lewis===
Lewis (David Lee Smith) is an art professor at WLVU who dated the first victim, Janet Kent, and taught art to Kaitlin Rackish and several of the other victims.&lt;ref&gt;Season 5, episode 6, "[[What's Eating Gilbert Grissom?]]"&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally in the frame for the 1987–88 murders but was later exonerated by the same [[DNA]] evidence which convicted John Mathers.

==Kevin Greer's background and story==
Kevin Greer worked at the WLVU's campus press from 1983 to 2004, and was the only employee of the press to have worked there for more than 10 years when he was caught. He also had a job writing explicit comic books for a sex shop, under the pseudonym of Zippy T. He commits the first murder at the approximate age of 16 prior to the events of "[[The Execution of Catherine Willows]]", estimated from the show's chronology to be in 1987. In 1988, John Mathers is arrested and placed on [[death row]] for 15 years; in that time Greer stopped his killing spree, so that Mathers would die and take the blame to his grave. On the day of Mathers' execution, Greer kills his fourth victim, Debbie Reston. Although he intends to kill one victim every year on that day, he does not do so in 2003 because unsuccessful [[LASIK]] surgery had temporarily damaged his eyesight (he elected to have the surgery because Debbie Reston broke his glasses in a struggle). The following year, however, he kills Jonathan Haywood, mistaking him for his intended target Kaitlin Rackish because Haywood had long hair and Greer's poor post-LASIK night vision led him to mistake Haywood for a woman. He later tracks Kaitlin down and kills her, but the evidence that he leaves behind at the crime scene (photocopier toner from the WLVU press) leads to his arrest.

After [[SWAT]] raids his house, Greer leaves a phone message saying that he would be waiting for Grissom at the police station. When Grissom and [[Jim Brass|Brass]] arrive, Greer greets them as "Gil" and "Jim", and taunts them about their search. Greer then promises to lead the officers to the location of a sixth victim, Brit Mosscoe. However, this is a ruse (Brit Mosscoe is an [[anagram]] of "Miss October", from a calendar hanging in Greer's garage). He asks to go to the bathroom before he leaves, and although an officer escorts him into the facilities, he goes unattended into a cubicle. After [[Sara Sidle]] calls [[Catherine Willows|Catherine]] to inform the others of the deception, Grissom and Brass break into the cubicle and find Greer with a black plastic bag tied around his head. They tear the bag off and attempt [[CPR]], but Greer is already dead.

Returning to the interrogation room, Grissom finds a drawing which, when folded, reveals a picture of Grissom and the word "goodbye".
