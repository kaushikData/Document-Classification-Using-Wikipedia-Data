'''Alpine Astrovillage''' (AAV) is a center for [[astrophotography]] and [[Amateur astronomy|stargazing]] in the eastern [[Swiss Alps]], high above the valley floor of the [[Val Müstair]] in the [[Grisons|canton Graubünden]]. It was founded by Drs. [[Vaclav Ourednik|Vaclav]] &amp; [[Jitka Ourednik]] during the [[International Year of Astronomy|International Year of Astronomy 2009]]. The complete name is Alpine Astrovillage Lü-Stailas (for “star light” in the [[Romansh language]] of the Canton). With its geographic location at an altitude above {{convert|1900|metre|feet}} and an exquisite sky quality with minimal [[light pollution]], AAV is a unique place in [[Central Europe]] for all astronomical purposes. The program includes multi-day courses in astrophotography and sky observation. In collaboration with schools, AAV offers students the possibility to accomplish, under competent guidance, the practical parts of their [[matura]] (or [[Bachelor of Arts|Bachelor]]) or [[Master's degree|Masters]] projects.

AAV also organizes and supervises astrophotography trips to the darkest places on Earth, including visits to the most famous and biggest professional observatories. Meanwhile, the Center enjoys, thanks to its educative activities, great national and international popularity and respect. For years, it has been known as an ''[[Erlebnisperle des Kantons Graubünden]]'' (Destination Pearl of the canton Graubünden). With its activity, the Center contributes in an important way to the preservation of the last dark sky oases on the planet for the coming generations.[[File:Mlhovina_Koňská_hlava_(také_Barnard_33_a_IC_434).jpg|Horsehead Nebula (Barnard 33), Foto: Alpine Astrovillage Lü-Stailas|alt=Horsehead Nebula (Barnard 33), Foto: Alpine Astrovillage Lü-Stailas|thumb]]

The '''Anglo-Burmese people''', also known as the '''Anglo-Burmans''', are a community of [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]] of Burmese and European descent, who emerged as a distinct community through mixed relations (sometimes permanent, sometimes temporary) between the British and other European settlers and the indigenous peoples of Burma from 1826 until 1948 when [[Myanmar]] gained its independence from the [[United Kingdom]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Those who could not adjust to the new way of life after Independence and the coming of military rule are dispersed throughout the world, with very few accurate estimates as to how many remain behind in military-ruled Burma.

The term Anglo-Burmese is also used to refer to Eurasians of European and other Burmese ethnic minority groups (e.g. [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Mon people|Mon]], [[Chinese people in Burma|Sino-Burmese]]) descent.  It also, after 1937, included [[Anglo-Indian]] residents in Burma.  Collectively, in the Burmese language, Eurasians are specifically known as '' bo kabya''; the term ''kabya'' refers to persons of mixed ancestry or dual ethnicity.

==History==

===Earliest settlement===
The first Anglo-Burmese community emerged in the early 17th century as the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Bamar people]] intermixed. This [[multiculturalism|multicultural community]] was collectively known as the ''Ba-yin-gyi''. The community was established near Syriam (modern [[Thanlyin]]) on the outskirts of modern-day [[Yangon]]. The settlement was founded by [[Filipe de Brito e Nicote]]. De Brito is said to have gone mad, having declared himself king of [[Lower Burma]] and captured [[Natshinnaung]] in an attack on Syriam, causing his outpost to be destroyed and himself executed by the Burmese king [[Anaukpetlun]] in 1613. Most of his small community of European settlers and their families was banished inland to [[Shwebo]], then known as Moksobo; they were employed as gunners by the king and their descendants settled along the [[Mu River]].{{sfn|Damrongrāchānuphāp|2001|p=189-90}} When the British Burma Army was established in 1937, it was the Anglo-Burmans who comprised the only anti-aircraft battery.{{sfn|Callahan|2005|p=40}}

Additionally, a small band of French soldiers captured in the late 18th century by [[Alaungpaya]], founder of the [[Konbaung Dynasty]], was provided with Bamar wives and established a new Eurasian community that is classified as Anglo-Burman. They were employed as elite gunners under [[Pierre de Milard]].{{sfn|Harvey|1967|p=231}} During the Mon-Bamar conflict in the 18th century, [[Sieur de Bruno]] was acting as a military advisor to the Mons and French warships participated in fighting against the Burmese in Syriam and Dagon (ancient Yangon).{{sfn|Harvey|1967|p=277}} Alaungpaya managed to capture Syriam in July 1756.{{sfn|Hall|2008|p=82}}  Sieur de Bruno and the other French with him were captured and tortured. Two French ships arriving two days after the capture of Syriam, ''Fleury'' and ''Galathée'',{{sfn|Harvey|1967|p=231}} with reinforcements and supplies were also captured by Alaungpaya when he forced Bruno to write a letter to trick them. The French captains were killed, Sieur de Bruno was roasted to death, and the 200 sailors were forced to join the Konbaung army.{{sfn|Hall|2008|p=82}}{{sfn|Harvey|1967|p=231}}

From his two ships, Alaugpaya managed to put his hands on 35 [[24-pounder long gun]]s, five field guns, 1300 muskets and a large quantity of ammunitions.{{sfn|Harvey|1967|p=231}} The French troops with their guns and muskets were incorporated in the Konbaung army as gunners and played a key role in the later battles between the Burmese and the Mons. They were treated well and received Burmese wives.{{sfn|Harvey|1967|p=231}} They became an elite corps, which was to play an important role in the Burmese battles against [[Thailand]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]].{{sfn|O'Rourke|2007|p=277}} One of them, [[Pierre de Milard]], was ultimately nominated Captain of the Guard and Master of the Ordnance for the Konbaung Dynasty.{{sfn|O'Rourke|2007|p=277}} When they reached old age, these French soldiers were able to retire to [[Shwebo]] villages with the spiritual support of a priest of the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Harvey|1967|p=231}} To this day, some Catholic villages are still extant in the area where an awareness of some European ancestry remains.{{sfn|Thant Myint-U|2001|p=27}}

[[File:Frederick Alexander Charles Trutwein family portrait.jpg|thumb|A prominent Anglo-Burmese family, circa 1900.]]
The first war with the British formally ended in 1826 with the [[Treaty of Yandabo]], with the coastal provinces of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] and [[Tanintharyi Region|Tanintharyi]] ("Tenasserim") being annexed to British rule and [[Mawlamyine]] ("Moulmein") established as the Brititsh colonial capital.&lt;ref name="Riddick2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Riddick|first=John F|title=The History of British India: A Chronology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Es6x4u_g19UC&amp;pg=PA37|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32280-8|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852, the second [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] concluded with the annexation of the [[Bago Region]] to what became known as [[Lower Burma|Lower or "British" Burma]].

The [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]] began in 1886 after a number of social and legal issues combined with the revelation of a commercial trade agreement [[Thibaw Min|King Thibaw Min]] had made with the [[French Third Republic]]. The British, fearing the French were going to annex [[Upper Burma]] as a French colonial province, responded by annexing the remainder of Burma. King Thibaw and most of his relatives of importance were exiled to India and Burma was made a [[presidencies and provinces of British India|province of British India]].&lt;ref name="Afsheen2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Afsheen|first=S|title=Under Five Flags: Life Like a Turbulent River Flows|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkQeAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|date=21 July 2011|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4628-9179-5|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

British settlers now began to settle in large numbers in Burma, intermixing with the [[Bamar people|Bamar]] and other local ethnic groups, and the Eurasian community grew larger, some say larger than the Anglo-Indian community in India.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Finding George Orwell'' by Emma Larkin&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, European men took Burmese women as "temporary" wives, often deserting them and their offspring after their tours of duty ended in Burma, not dissimilar to the Spanish and French practice of [[plaçage]], but legal marriages did take place. Frequently, when a "temporary" relationship ended, the European father left behind a sum of money for the upkeep of their children. Sometimes the children were removed from their mothers and placed into convent schools run by Europeans, where their Burmese heritage was often undermined. The issue of mixed marriages, particularly between Bamar women and British males, was to become a major issue in the independence movement as it further developed.

Anglo-Burmans represent a very diverse heritage, their Asian heritage primarily Bamar, but also [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Shan people|Shan]] and [[Mon people|Mon]] as well as other smaller Burmese ethnic groups like the [[Kuki people|Kuki]], [[Jingpo people|Jingpo]] and [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]].

The European element included, aside from the English, other European influence, chiefly [[Greeks]], [[Dutch people|the Dutch]], [[Scandinavia]]ns, [[Irish people|Irish]] (who left their country due to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]), [[Germans]], [[Austrian people|Austrians]], [[French people|the French]], [[Portuguese people|the Portuguese]], [[Italians]] and other non-European [[Russians]]. [[Armenians]], [[Syrian people|Syrian]], [[Egyptians]] and the [[Anglo-Indian]] were also represented among Anglo-Burmans.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

One unusual addition to the mix was [[Baghdadi Jews]].&lt;ref name="Cernea2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fredman Cernea|first=Ruth|title=Almost Englishmen: Baghdadi Jews in British Burma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVCzxtaSCXAC|year=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-1647-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, the Anglo-Burman community was a distinct ethnic group in Burma.

In 1935, colonial Burma was plagued with riots due to the country having been swallowed into British India. In response, in 1937, as Burma separated officially from British India and formed a separate crown colony, Anglo-Burmans were officially recognised as an ethnic group under the Government of Burma Act. Having European blood, Anglo-Burmans were a privileged class and became one of the dominant ethnic groups in Burmese life. They began assimilating to European customs, in particular British. Most Anglo-Burmans (unlike Anglo-Indians and the [[Burgher people]] in [[Sri Lanka]]) were able to trace at least a grandparent, if not a parent, originating from outside of Burma's borders. As such, the connection with the West was strong, and many Anglo-Burmans did not settle down as a truly indigenous ethnic group. Of course, some Anglo-Burmans did, and most of the community felt Burma was their own country, with no wish to "repatriate" to their European homeland. In fact, after Independence, the Anglo-Burman Union carried out research among the community to gauge the feeling of its people with regard to nationality. It was discovered that around 60% intended to remain in Burma and take Burmese citizenship&lt;ref name="Koop1960"&gt;{{cite book|last=Koop|first=John Clement|title=The Eurasian Population in Burma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KkSAAAAIAAJ|year=1960|publisher=Yale University, Southeast Asia Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the remaining 40% split between staying in Burma or leaving for Australia or the UK.

Along with the British settlers, Anglo-Indians came into Burma during colonial times to work on the railways and customs departments; intermarriage between the groups (Anglo-Indian and Anglo-Burmese) was frequent, especially in [[Yangon]] ("Rangoon") as both communities were innately drawn to one another. Community clubs were a mainstay of life during British rule, with most attending what was commonly called the "Anglo-Indian/Domiciled European Club".

Between 1935 and 1948, Burma quickly became the jewel of the East, with a flourishing economy based on agricultural produce (primarily [[rice]], oil, timber, gems and other natural resources). At this time, Rangoon was said to be the most cosmopolitan city east of the [[Suez Canal]]; the city and its environs were estimated to hold at least 50% of the Anglo-Burmese community. During British rule, Yangon and Maymyo (modern [[Pyin Oo Lwin]]) became principal population centres for the Anglo-Burmese, although substantial communities existed in the [[Irrawaddy River]] delta towns as well as in [[Mandalay]], Mawlamyine, Amherst (now [[Kyaikkami]]), [[Taunggyi]], [[Kalaw]], [[Taungoo]], [[Pyinmana]], [[Meiktila]], [[Yenangyaung]] and the mining towns of the [[Shan States]].

Although prejudice existed among both colonial settlers and local populations, the Anglo-Burmese were not held in the same contempt as the Anglo-Indians were in India, despite their similar origins and heritage. This was reflected in the Burmese derogatory term ''bo kyet chee kala'' ("shit-colored Indians who think they are British") to refer to Anglo-Indians, in contrast to ''bo kabya'' which referred to Anglo-Burmans. Many Anglo-Indians in Burma never learnt to speak Burmese and managed to get by with [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which tended to alienate the locals. As far as the Burmese community was concerned, those willing to intermingle or blend in were as readily accepted as any kabya in the days of the Burmese kings, but those who looked down on the Burmese themselves were held in mutual contempt.

===Japanese occupation and Allied liberation===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
In 1942, the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]] invaded East and [[Southeast Asia]], including Burma, in hopes of creating an Empire for itself throughout Asia. Because of their European connections and appearance and fearful of Japanese rule, most Anglo-Burmans began making frantic preparations to leave the country for safety in India alongside the British. A vast majority of Anglo-Burmans made their way out of Burma by their own means, some by sea and others by air. Many were employed by government departments or were married to government employees and were able to flee on official evacuation convoys. Others stayed at their posts and ran the telegraphs and phone operations, railways and other infrastructure systems until it was too late to escape. Sadly, of those who were left behind, many opted to walk through the jungles to safety in India. This exodus has become historically known as "The Trek", and many Anglo-Burmans alongside Europeans, [[Burmese Indians|Indians]] and [[Burmese Chinese|Chinese]] died en route. Those who remained behind suffered horrendously.

Many Anglo-Burmese during colonial times were concentrated in and around the town of [[Maymyo]]. As the Japanese took control of the country, they found many there and simply incarcerated them in concentration camps for fear of their loyalty to the British. However, Anglo-Burmese who resembled [[Bamar]] were incognito and managed to pass, acting like the Burmans. Indeed, many Bamar sheltered their Eurasian friends and relatives from the Japanese and after the war. Many Anglo-Burmans were not to forget this, refusing to take back their European names and dress, appreciative of the security and protection offered to them, and disgraced with the manner in which the British handled the evacuation of the country and the abandonment of the community. Others less fortunate during the war were interned in prison camps whilst others, particularly the Anglo-Burman women, were taken as servants and mistresses by the Japanese army, most often unwillingly. In 1944, Burma's colonial government met in exile at [[Shimla|Simla]], India. Among those who attended were the governor of Burma, Sir [[Reginald Dorman Smith]], along with Anglo-Burman leaders (including James Barrington who was to become the first ambassador for post-independence Burma to the U.S.A. and Canada), to discuss the future of Burma after the war and the status of the Anglo-Burmese community. After Japan was defeated, most Anglo-Burmans who had fled to India returned to Burma.

===Simla Conference 1944===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith, governor of Burma in exile, met Anglo-Burmese leaders in [[Shimla|Simla]] in 1944, where the government of Burma in exile was stationed during the war, to discuss the future of the Anglo-Burmese community after the war.

The Anglo-Burmese delegates were:
*Mr. G. Kirkham
*Mr. H.J. Mitchell [[British Foreign Service|BFrS]]
*Mr. J. Barrington [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|ICS]]
*Mr. K.W. Foster [[British Colonial Service|BCS]]
*Mr. E.A. Franklin [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|ICS]]
*Mr. W.A. Gibson
*Mrs. K. Russell
*Mr. H. Elliott
*Mr. C.H. Campagnac
*Mr. J.A. Wiseham
*Mr. J. F. Blake.

One of the results of the conference was the giving of an assurance to the Anglo-Burmese community that they would be allowed to preserve their freedom of worship and allowed to teach their own religion, freedom to continue their own customs and maintain their own language of English. In the Constituent Assembly of 1947, Anglo-Burmans were to receive four assigned seats in the new parliament of independent Burma.

===Post-independence===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
On 4 January 1948, the Union of Burma declared its independence from Great Britain, immediately leaving the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and severing all ties with the British Empire. The British left protection clauses in the Constitution and the legislative makeup of independent Burma to take account of the Anglo-Burman people including, most importantly, reserved seats in the parliament of the newly established [[Union of Burma]] and a disproportionate number of Anglo-Burmans running the bureaucracy of day-to-day government and military operations. [[Aung San]] addressed the Anglo-Burman Union to press the issue of acceptance and the fears the community had for their presence in independent Burma. His assurances went to help with the decision by most of the community to remain in Burma after British withdrawal.

However, Aung San and his entire cabinet were assassinated before Independence. This sent a ripple effect through the country and among all ethnic minority groups, who Aung San had personally addressed to reassure them of their place in the new country. In February 1948, ethnic rebellions immediately erupted throughout Burma, with the [[Karen people|Kayin]] taking most of the central part of the country, including [[Mandalay]]. For a time, it was feared that Rangoon would fall to the rebels. Due to the insurrection and erupting civil war, there immediately followed, however, a stream of Anglo-Burmans leaving the country, who were fearful of what awaited them and the country since the end of British rule. At this time, about 30% of the population of Rangoon were reckoned as Anglo-Burmese. This proportion was to decline steadily through to the late 1960s.

Following the British withdrawal in 1948, some Anglo-Burmans left Burma, primarily for the United Kingdom. Many more remained behind in Burma and carried on with their lives. Through the 1950s, the situation steadily declined in the country, with armed insurrections and rebellions, principally among the [[Karen people|Kayin]] people. Due to the perceived suffering the Bamar had encountered under British rule, [[affirmative action]] of sorts was introduced by the government of [[U Nu]] in the 1950s, primarily due to the disproportionate control the Anglo-Burmans had in government departments and the running of the country. Many Anglo-Burmans began to lose their jobs, to be replaced with pure Burmans as the bureaucracy of the country became increasingly Burmanized. Additional measures relating to the Burmese language were introduced so that to take the matriculation exam to enter [[Rangoon University]], prospective students were required to be fluent in written Burmese (which many Anglo-Burmans had not been taught), even though all books and most teaching were still carried out in English.

===Military rule===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
In 1962 General [[Ne Win]] overthrew [[U Nu]]'s government and established strict military rule. It soon became apparent that this new military government had other plans as a socialist, xenophobic and isolationist regime was born. Many more Anglo-Burmans left due to discriminatory measures taken against minority groups, particularly those the military deemed as vestiges of colonial rule, specifically the Anglo-Burmese and the [[Karen people|Karen]]. Anglo-Burmans already in the [[Tatmadaw|Armed Forces]] were dismissed and those who wanted to join were now barred. There were mass dismissals of Anglo-Burmans from the Civil Service in departments where they had previously dominated such as the Railways, the Union of Burma Airways, Customs Department, Division of Forestry and Mining and the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs.

All schools were nationalised, the principal target being missionary schools, and English was no longer taught from kindergarten level. Standards began to fall in the education system and the previously highly esteemed University of Rangoon was closed for some time, after which the Rangoon University Student Union (RUSU), hotbed of the nationalist movement during the 1930s and 1940s, was blown up by the military. Once the university reopened its doors, English as the principal medium of instruction was abolished and foreign institutions no longer accepted degrees obtained from the university.

The Anglo-Burman Social Club in Rangoon was subsequently requisitioned by the military and turned into an officer’s mess and the Anglo-Burman Union was banned. During this time, many Anglo-Burmans left for Australia and New Zealand, with small numbers emigrating to [[Canada]] and the U.S.A.

===Present-day===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
Today, some people identifying themselves as Anglo-Burmans are believed to remain in Burma. Because of the similar heritage and roles played, and because Burma was part of the British Empire as part of India after British colonizations, Anglo-Burmans were once counted as Anglo-Indians; today, Anglo-Indians accept Anglo-Burmese as their "kith and kin". World reunions of Anglo-Indians usually include many who would be classed more correctly as Anglo-Burmese, to reflect their Burmese blood.

==Notable diaspora==
{{Original research section|date=February 2016}}
The most famous Anglo-Burmans today are to be found outside of Burma's borders such as the Bollywood actress [[Helen (actress)|Helen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinto|first1=Jerry|title=Helen : the life and times of an H-bomb|date=2005|publisher=Penguin|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0143031246|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Ng_vVIcq5yQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=helen+dancer+film+hindi+burma&amp;ots=X74gmQa0J7&amp;sig=0cg1LI-Qvp4LJubXUcsqjwCxZ3Q#v=onepage&amp;q=burma&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the late British television actor [[Richard Beckinsale]], his daughters the actresses [[Kate Beckinsale]] and [[Samantha Beckinsale]], British writer and journalist [[Sue Arnold]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=Sue|title=A Burmese legacy|date=1996|publisher=Sceptre|location=London|isbn=978-0340660058}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese-British music critic [[Peter Barakan]] ({{nihongo2|[[:jp:ピーター・バラカン|ピーター・バラカン]]}}), the British TV personality [[Melanie Sykes]], the jazz musician [[Jamie Cullum]] and his brother [[Ben Cullum]] and the singer [[Annabella Lwin]]. 
The alternative musician [[Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly]] (né Sam Duckworth) is also Anglo-Burmese.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The sons of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] and [[Michael Aris]], Alexander and Kim, are technically Anglo-Burmese, despite not stemming from the colonial era. There is also [[Zuleikha Robinson]], a British actress raised in Thailand and Malaysia by a Burmese-Indian mother and an English father. American television host and liberal commentator [[Alex Wagner]], who was born to a Burmese mother and a father of German and Irish descent, can be called Anglo-Burmese by basis of heritage.
Burmese writer [[Wendy Law-Yone]] and her daughter [[Jocelyn Seagrave]], who is a U.S. actress, are also Anglo-Burmese.

However, there are also Anglo-Burmans still living in Burma. They include famous singer and actress Rita Fairmen ([[Myint Myint Khin]]), and famous singers Marie Conway (Tin Moe Khaing) and Joyce Win ([[Nwe Yin Win]]).

==Educational system==
Anglo-Burmans were enrolled in missionary-run schools where English was the medium of instruction with [[Burmese language|Burmese]] as a second language. For some Anglo-Burmans who married full blooded Burmese, their children, whilst still being counted as Anglo-Burmans, were usually more openly exposed to the indigenous culture and spoke and used the Burmese language more frequently than their more "Anglo" counterparts. Notable schools include:

*[[Basic Education High School No. 4 Ahlon|Cushing High School]], Rangoon
*[[Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon|Methodist English High School]], Rangoon
*[[Basic Education High School No. 2 Kamayut|St. Augustine's School]], Rangoon

[[File:William Morris design for Trellis wallpaper 1862.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|[[William Morris]] design for "Trellis" wallpaper, 1862]]
The '''Arts and Crafts movement''' was an international movement in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920, emerging in Japan (the [[Mingei]] movement) in the 1920s. It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms, and often used medieval, romantic, or folk styles of decoration. It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moses N. Ikiugu and Elizabeth A. Ciaravino, ''Psychosocial Conceptual Practice models in Occupational Therapy''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] | url= http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/british_galleries/bg_styles/Style09a/index.html | title= Arts and Crafts Style Guide | work=British Galleries | accessdate= 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by [[Modernism]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref name="grove"/&gt; and its influence continued among craft makers, designers, and town planners long afterwards.&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014/&gt;

The term was first used by [[T. J. Cobden-Sanderson]] at a meeting of the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]] in 1887,&lt;ref name=crawford&gt;Alan Crawford, ''C. R. Ashbee: Architect, Designer &amp; Romantic Socialist'', Yale University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0300109393}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the principles and style on which it was based had been developing in England for at least twenty years. It was inspired by the ideas of architect [[Augustus Pugin]], writer [[John Ruskin]], and designer [[William Morris]].&lt;ref name=triggs&gt;{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=1woOAQAAIAAJ | first= Oscar Lovell | last=Triggs | title=Chapters in the History of the Arts and Crafts Movement | year = 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement developed earliest and most fully in the British Isles,&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Grove Encyclopedia of [[Decorative Arts]], Volume 1 | isbn = 978-0-19-518948-3 | first = Gordon | last = Campbell | publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and spread across the British Empire and to the rest of Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Kaplan and Alan Crawford, ''The Arts &amp; Crafts Movement in Europe &amp; America: Design for the Modern World'', Los Angeles County Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; It was largely a reaction against the perceived impoverished state of the [[decorative arts]] at the time and the conditions in which they were produced.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;Brenda M. King, ''Silk and Empire''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and influences==
===Design reform===
The Arts and Crafts movement emerged from the attempt to reform design and decoration in mid 19th century Britain. It was a reaction against a perceived decline in standards that the reformers associated with machinery and factory production. Their critique was sharpened by the items they saw in [[the Great Exhibition of 1851]], which they considered to be excessively ornate, artificial and ignorant of the qualities of the materials used.


The art historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] has said that exhibits in the Great Exhibition showed "ignorance of that basic need in creating patterns, the integrity of the surface" and "vulgarity in detail".&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; Design reform began with the organisers of the Exhibition itself, [[Henry Cole]] (1808–1882), [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] (1809–1874), [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]] (1820–1877) and [[Richard Redgrave]] (1804–1888),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/w/wallpaper-design-reform/ V&amp;A, "Wallpaper Design Reform"]&lt;/ref&gt; who deprecated excessive ornament and impractical and badly made things.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} The organisers were "unanimous in their condemnation of the exhibits."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=20}} Owen Jones, for example, complained that "the architect, the upholsterer, the paper-stainer, the weaver, the calico-printer, and the potter" produce "in art novelty without beauty, or beauty without intelligence."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=20}} From these criticisms of the contemporary state of manufactured goods emerged several publications which set out what the writers considered to be the correct principles of design. Richard Redgrave's ''Supplementary Report on Design'' (1852) analysed the principles of design and ornament and pleaded for "more logic in the application of decoration."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} Other works followed in a similar vein: Wyatt's ''Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century'' (1853), [[Gottfried Semper]]'s ''Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst'' ("Science, Industry and Art") (1852), [[Ralph Wornum]]'s ''Analysis of Ornament'' (1856), Redgrave's ''Manual of Design'' (1876) and Jones's ''Grammar of Ornament'' (1856).{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} The ''Grammar of Ornament'' was particularly influential, liberally distributed as a student prize and running into nine reprints by 1910.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}}

Jones declared that "Ornament ... must be secondary to the thing decorated", that there must be "fitness in the ornament to the thing ornamented", and that wallpapers and carpets must not have any patterns "suggestive of anything but a level or plain".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Nikolaus Pevsner, ''Pioneers of Modern Design''&lt;/ref&gt; Where a fabric or wallpaper in the Great Exhibition might be decorated with a natural motif made to look as real as possible, these writers advocated flat and simplified natural motifs. Redgrave insisted that "style" demanded sound construction before ornamentation, and a proper awareness of the quality of materials used. "''Utility'' must have precedence over ornamentation."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=22}}

However, the design reformers of the mid 19th century did not go as far as the designers of the Arts and Crafts Movement: they were more concerned with ornamentation than construction, they had an incomplete understanding of methods of manufacture,{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=22}} and they did not criticise industrial methods as such. By contrast, the Arts and Crafts movement was as much a movement of social reform as design reform and its leading practitioners did not separate the two.

[[File:The Grange, Ramsgate 1.jpg|thumb|right|Pugin's house, "The Grange", in Ramsgate, 1843. Its simplified Gothic style, adapted to domestic building, helped shape the architecture of the Arts and Crafts Movement.]]

Some of the ideas of the movement were anticipated by [[A.W.N. Pugin]] (1812–1852), a leader in the [[Gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival in architecture]]. For example, he, like the Arts and Crafts artists, advocated truth to material, structure and function.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A /&gt; Pugin articulated the tendency of social critics to compare the faults of modern society (such as the sprawling growth of cities and the treatment of the poor) unfavorably with the Middle Ages,&lt;ref name=hill&gt;Rosemary Hill, ''God's Architect: Pugin and the Building of Romantic Britain'', London: Allen Lane, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; a tendency that became routine with Ruskin, Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. His book ''Contrasts'' (1836) drew examples of bad modern buildings and town planning in contrast with good medieval examples, and his biographer [[Rosemary Hill]] notes that in it he "reached conclusions, almost in passing, about the importance of craftsmaship and tradition in architecture that it would take the rest of the century and the combined efforts of Ruskin and Morris to work out in detail." She describes the spare furnishings he specified for a building in 1841—"rush chairs, oak tables"—as "the Arts and Crafts interior in embryo."&lt;ref name=hill /&gt;

===John Ruskin===
{{expand section|date=December 2014}}
The Arts and Crafts philosophy derived in large measure from [[John Ruskin]]'s social criticism, which related the moral and social health of a nation to the qualities of its architecture and to the nature of work. Ruskin (1819–1900) considered the sort of mechanized production and division of labour that had been created in the [[industrial revolution]] to be "servile labour" and he thought that a healthy and moral society required independent workers who designed the things they made. His followers favoured craft production over industrial manufacture and were concerned about the loss of traditional skills, but they were arguably more troubled by the effects of the [[factory system]] than by machinery itself&lt;ref name=sarsby&gt;Jacqueline Sarsby" Alfred Powell: Idealism and Realism in the Cotswolds", ''Journal of Design History'', Vol. 10, No. 4, pp. 375-397&lt;/ref&gt; and William Morris's idea of "handicraft" was essentially work without any division of labour rather than work without any sort of machinery.&lt;ref name=pye&gt;David Pye, ''The Nature and Art of Workmanship'', Cambridge University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Morris===
[[File:William Morris age 53.jpg|thumb|upright|William Morris, the main influence on the Arts and Crafts Movement]]
[[William Morris]] (1834–1896), the towering figure in late 19th century design, was the main influence on the Arts and Crafts movement. The aesthetic and social vision of the Arts and Crafts movement derived from ideas he developed in the 1850s with a group of students at the [[University of Oxford]], who combined a love of [[Romantic literature]] with a commitment to social reform.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|pp=96-97}} By 1855 they had discovered Ruskin and, believing there to be a contrast between the barbarity of contemporary art and the painters preceding [[Raphael]] (1483-1530), they formed themselves into the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] to pursue their artistic aims. The [[medieval]]ism of [[Mallory]]'s ''[[Morte d'Arthur]]'' set the standard for their early style.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|p=49}} In [[Edward Burne-Jones]]' words, they intended to "wage Holy warfare against the age".{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=97}}

[[File:The Red House, Bexleyheath.JPG|thumb|William Morris's [[Red House (London)|Red House]] in London designed by Philip Webb. Completed 1860, it is one of the most significant buildings of the Arts and Crafts Movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/red-house#Overview National Trust, "Iconic Arts and Crafts home of William Morris"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Morris began experimenting with various crafts and designing [[furniture]] and [[interior design|interiors]].{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}} He was personally involved in manufacture as well as design,{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}} which was to be the hallmark of the Arts and Crafts movement. Ruskin had argued that the separation of the intellectual act of design from the manual act of physical creation was both socially and aesthetically damaging; Morris further developed this idea, insisting that no work should be carried out in his workshops before he had personally mastered the appropriate techniques and materials, arguing that "without dignified, creative human occupation people became disconnected from life".{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}}

[[File:Morris and Company Weaving at Merton Abbey.jpg|thumb|The weaving shed in Morris &amp; Co's factory at [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]], which opened in the 1880s]]

In 1861 Morris began making furniture and decorative objects commercially, modeling his designs on medieval styles and using bold forms and strong colors. His patterns were based on flora and fauna  and his products were inspired by the vernacular or domestic traditions of the British countryside. In order to display the beauty of the materials and the work of the craftsman, some were deliberately left unfinished, creating a rustic appearance. Truth to materials, structure and function became characteristic of the Arts and Crafts movement.

Unlike their counterparts in the United States, most Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain had strong, slightly incoherent, negative feelings about machinery. They thought of 'the craftsman' as free, creative, and working with his hands, 'the machine' as soulless, repetitive, and inhuman. These contrasting images derive in part from John Ruskin's (1819-1900) ''The Stones of Venice'', an architectural history of Venice that contains a powerful denunciation of modern industrialism to which Arts and Crafts designers returned again and again. Distrust for the machine lay behind the many little workshops that turned their backs on the industrial world around 1900, using preindustrial techniques to create what they called 'crafts.'

===Critique of industry===
William Morris shared Ruskin's critique of industrial society and at one time or another attacked the modern factory, the use of machinery, the division of labour, capitalism and the loss of traditional craft methods. But his attitude to machinery was inconsistent. He said at one point that production by machinery was "altogether an evil",&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; but at others he was willing to commission work from manufacturers who were able to meet his standards with the aid of machines;&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Shankland, "William Morris - Designer", in Asa Briggs (ed.) ''William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980 {{ISBN|0-14-020521-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he said that, in a "true society", where neither luxuries nor cheap trash were made, machinery could be improved and used to reduce the hours of labour.&lt;ref&gt;William Morris, "Useful Work versus Useless Toil", in Asa Briggs (ed.) ''William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980 {{ISBN|0-14-020521-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiona MacCarthy says that "unlike later zealots like [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], William Morris had no practical objections to the use of machinery ''per se'' so long as the machines produced the quality he needed."{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|p=351}}

Morris insisted that the artist should be a craftsman-designer working by hand&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; and advocated a society of free craftspeople, such as he believed had existed during the Middle Ages. "Because craftsmen took pleasure in their work", he wrote, "the Middle Ages was a period of greatness the art of the common people. ... The treasures in our museums now are only the common utensils used in households of that age, when hundreds of medieval churches—each one a masterpiece—were built by unsophisticated peasants."&lt;ref name=mingei/&gt; Medieval art was the model for much Arts and Crafts design and medieval life, literature and building was idealised by the movement.

Morris's followers also had differing views about machinery and the factory system. [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C.&amp;nbsp;R. Ashbee]], for example, a central figure in the Arts and Crafts Movement, said in 1888, that, "We do not reject the machine, we welcome it. But we would desire to see it mastered."&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashbee, C.&amp;nbsp;R., ''A Few Chapters on Workshop Construction and Citizenship'', London, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; After unsuccessfully pitting his Guild and School of Handicraft guild against modern methods of manufacture, he acknowledged that "Modern civilization rests on machinery",&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; but he continued to criticize the deleterious effects of what he called "mechanism", saying that "the production of certain mechanical commodities is as bad for the national health as is the production of slave-grown cane or child-sweated wares."&lt;ref&gt;"C.&amp;nbsp;R. Ashbee, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art?'', New York and London: Garland, 1978, p.12 (Facsimile of the 1911 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Arthur Smith Benson]], on the other hand, had no qualms about adapting the Arts and Crafts style to metalwork produced under industrial conditions. (See quotation box.)

Morris and his followers believed the division of labour on which modern industry depended was undesirable, but the extent to which every design should be carried out by the designer was a matter for debate and disagreement. Not all Arts and Crafts artists carried out every stage in the making of goods themselves, and it was only in the twentieth century that that became essential to the definition of craftsmanship. Although Morris was famous for getting hands-on experience himself of many crafts (including weaving, dying, printing, calligraphy and embroidery), he did not regard the separation of designer and executant in his factory as problematic. Walter Crane, a close political associate of Morris's, took an unsympathetic view of the division of labour on both moral and artistic grounds, and strongly advocated that designing and making should come from the same hand. Lewis Foreman Day, a friend and contemporary of Crane's, as unstinting as Crane in his admiration of Morris, disagreed strongly with Crane. He thought that the separation of design and execution was not only inevitable in the modern world, but also that only that sort of specialisation allowed the best in design and the best in making.&lt;ref&gt;[https://marshallcolman.blogspot.co.uk/2017/06/designer-and-executant-argument-between.html Designer and Executant: An Argument Between Walter Crane and Lewis Foreman Day]&lt;/ref&gt;  Few of the founders of the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]] insisted that the designer should also be the maker. Peter Floud, writing in the 1950s, said that "The founders of the Society ... never executed their own designs, but invariably turned them over to commercial firms."&lt;ref name=floud&gt;Peter Floud, "The crafts then and now", ''The Studio'', 1953, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that the designer should be the maker and the maker the designer derived "not from Morris or early Arts and Crafts teaching, but rather from the second-generation elaboration doctrine worked out in the first decade of [the twentieth] century by men such as [[W. R. Lethaby]]".&lt;ref name=floud/&gt;

===Socialism===
Many of the Arts and Crafts Movement designers were socialists, including Morris, [[T. J. Cobden Sanderson]], [[Walter Crane]], C.R.Ashbee, [[Philip Webb]], [[Charles Joseph Faulkner|Charles Faulkner]] and [[A.H.Mackmurdo]].{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=109}} In the early 1880s Morris was spending more of his time on socialist propaganda than on designing and making.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=640-663}} Ashbee established a community of craftsmen, the Guild of Handicraft, in east London, later moving to [[Chipping Campden]].&lt;ref name=crawford/&gt; Those adherents who were not socialists, for example, [[Alfred Hoare Powell]],&lt;ref name=sarsby/&gt; advocated a more humane and personal relationship between employer and employee. [[Lewis Foreman Day]], a very successful and influential Arts and Crafts designer, was not a socialist either, despite his long friendship with Crane.

===Association with other reform movements===
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
In Britain the movement was associated with [[dress reform]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/victorian-dress-at-v-and-a/ V&amp;A, "Victorian Dress at the V&amp;A"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[ruralism]], the [[garden city movement]]&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014&gt;Fiona MacCarthy, ''Anarchy and Beauty: William Morris and his Legacy 1860-1960'', London: National Portrait Gallery, 2014 {{ISBN|978 185514 484 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cecil Sharp|the folk-song revival]]. All were linked, in some degree, by the ideal of "the Simple Life".&lt;ref&gt;Fiona McCarthy. ''The Simple Life'', Lund Humphries, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In continental Europe the movement was associated with the preservation of national traditions in building, the applied arts, domestic design and costume.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Development==
Morris's designs quickly became popular, attracting interest when his company's work was exhibited at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] in London. Much of Morris &amp; Co's early work was for churches and Morris won important interior design commissions at [[St James's Palace]] and the [[South Kensington Museum]] (now the Victoria and Albert Museum). Later his work became popular with the middle and upper classes, despite his wish to create a democratic art, and by the end of the 19th century, Arts and Crafts design in houses and domestic interiors was the dominant style in Britain, copied in products made by conventional industrial methods.

The spread of Arts and Crafts ideas during the late 19th and early 20th centuries resulted in the establishment of many associations and craft communities, although Morris had little to do with them because of his preoccupation with socialism at the time. A hundred and thirty Arts and Crafts organisations were formed in Britain, most between 1895 and 1905.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=602|}}

In 1881, [[Eglantyne Louisa Jebb]], [[Mary Fraser Tytler]] and others initiated the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] to encourage the working classes, especially those in rural areas, to take up handicrafts under supervision, not for profit, but in order to provide them with useful occupations and to improve their taste. By 1889 it had 450 classes, 1,000 teachers and 5,000 students.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=120}}

In 1882, architect [[A.H.Mackmurdo]] formed the [[Century Guild of Artists|Century Guild]], a partnership of designers including [[Selwyn Image]], [[Herbert Horne]], Clement Heaton and [[Benjamin Creswick]].{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=591}}{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=115}}

In 1884, the [[Art Workers Guild]] was initiated by five young architects, [[William Lethaby]], [[Edward Schroeder Prior|Edward Prior]], [[Ernest Newton]], Mervyn Macartney and [[Gerald C. Horsley]], with the goal of bringing together fine and applied arts and raising the status of the latter. It was directed originally by [[George Blackall Simonds]]. By 1890 the Guild had 150 members, representing the increasing number of practitioners of the Arts and Crafts style.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=593}} It still exists.

The London department store [[Liberty &amp; Co.]], founded in 1875, was a prominent retailer of goods in the style and of the "[[artistic dress]]" favoured by followers of the Arts and Crafts movement.

In 1887 the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]], which gave its name to the movement, was formed with [[Walter Crane]] as president, holding its first exhibition in the [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]], London, in November 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Linda, ''William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement: A Sourcebook'', New York, Portland House, 1989 {{ISBN|0-517-69260-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first show of contemporary decorative arts in London since the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]'s Winter Exhibition of 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chestofbooks.com/arts/essays/Theoretical-Practical-Critical-Ideals/Of-The-Arts-And-Crafts-Movement-Part-4.html |title=Crane, Walter, "Of the Arts and Crafts Movement", in '&amp;#39;Ideals In Art: Papers Theoretical Practical Critical'&amp;#39;, George Bell &amp; Sons, 1905 |publisher=Chestofbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morris &amp; Co.]] was well represented in the exhibition with furniture, fabrics, carpets and embroideries. [[Edward Burne-Jones]] observed, "here for the first time one can measure a bit the change that has happened in the last twenty years".{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=596}} The society still exists as the Society of Designer Craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societyofdesignercraftsmen.org.uk/ |title=Society of Designer Craftsmen |publisher=Society of Designer Craftsmen |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C.R.Ashbee]], a major late practitioner of the style in England, founded the [[Guild and School of Handicraft]] in the East End of London. The guild was a craft co-operative modelled on the medieval guilds and intended to give working men satisfaction in their craftsmanship. Skilled craftsmen, working on the principles of Ruskin and Morris, were to produce hand-crafted goods and manage a school for apprentices. The idea was greeted with enthusiasm by almost everyone except Morris, who was by now involved with promoting [[socialism]] and thought Ashbee's scheme trivial. From 1888 to 1902 the guild prospered, employing about 50 men. In 1902 Ashbee relocated the guild out of London to begin an experimental community in [[Chipping Campden]] in the [[Cotswolds]]. The guild's work is characterized by plain surfaces of hammered silver, flowing wirework and colored stones in simple settings. Ashbee designed jewellery and silver tableware. The guild flourished at Chipping Camden but did not prosper and was liquidated in 1908. Some craftsmen stayed, contributing to the tradition of modern craftsmanship in the area.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Ashbee.htm |title=Utopia Britannica |publisher=Utopia Britannica |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/home |title=Court Barn Museum |publisher=Courtbarn.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C.F.A. Voysey]] (1857–1941) was an Arts and Crafts architect who also designed fabrics, tiles, ceramics, furniture and metalwork.  His style combined simplicity with sophistication. His wallpapers and textiles, featuring stylised bird and plant forms in bold outlines with flat colors, were used widely.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A/&gt;

Morris's thought influenced the [[distributism]] of [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Joseph Nuttgens, London Review of Books, 13 May 2010 p 4&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the nineteenth century, Arts and Crafts ideals had influenced architecture, painting, sculpture, graphics, illustration, book making and photography, domestic design and the decorative arts, including furniture and woodwork, stained glass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cormack|first1=Peter|title=Arts and Crafts Stained Glass|date=2015|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-20970-9|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; leatherwork, lacemaking, embroidery, rug making and weaving, jewelry and metalwork, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]ing and ceramics.&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt; By 1910, there was a fashion for "Arts and Crafts" and all things hand-made. There was a proliferation of amateur handicrafts of variable quality&lt;ref&gt;"Arts and Crafts", ''Journal of the Royal Society of Arts'', Vol. 56, No. 2918, 23 October 1908, pp. 1023-1024&lt;/ref&gt; and of incompetent imitators who caused the public to regard Arts and Crafts as "something less, instead of more, competent and fit for purpose than an ordinary mass produced article."&lt;ref&gt;[[Noel Rooke]], "The Craftsman and Education for Industry", in ''Four Papers Read by Members of the Arts &amp; Crafts Exhibition Society'', London: Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society held eleven exhibitions between 1888 and 1916. By the outbreak of war in 1914 it was in decline and faced a crisis. Its 1912 exhibition had been a financial failure.&lt;ref name=harrod&gt;Tania Harrod, ''The Crafts in Britain in the 20th Century'', Yale University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-300-07780-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While designers in continental Europe were making innovations in design and alliances with industry through initiatives such as the [[Deutsche Werkbund]] and new initiatives were being taken in Britain by the [[Omega Workshops]] and the [[Design in Industries Association]], the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, now under the control of an old guard, was withdrawing from commerce and collaboration with manufacturers into purist handwork and what Tania Harrod describes as "decommoditisation"&lt;ref name=harrod/&gt; Its rejection of a commercial role has been seen as a turning point in its fortunes.&lt;ref name=harrod/&gt; Nikolaus Pevsner in his book ''Pioneers of Modern Design'' presents the Arts and Crafts Movement as design radicals who influenced the modern movement, but failed to change and were eventually superseded by it.&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt;

===Later influences===
The British artist potter [[Bernard Leach]] brought to England many ideas he had developed in Japan with the social critic [[Yanagi Soetsu]] about the moral and social value of simple crafts; both were enthusiastic readers of Ruskin. Leach was an active propagandist for these ideas, which struck a chord with practitioners of the crafts in the inter-war years, and he expounded them in ''A Potter's Book'', published in 1940, which denounced industrial society in terms as vehement as those of Ruskin and Morris. Thus the Arts and Crafts philosophy was perpetuated among British craft workers in the 1950s and 1960s, long after the demise of the Arts and Crafts movement and at the high tide of Modernism. British [[Utility furniture]] of the 1940s also derived from Arts and Crafts principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/crd_desref.html Designing Britain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515141802/http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/crd_desref.html |date=May 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its main promoters, [[Sydney Gordon Russell|Gordon Russell]], chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel, was imbued with Arts and Crafts ideas. He manufactured furniture in the Cotswold Hills, a region of Arts and Crafts furniture-making since Ashbee, and he was a member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. William Morris's biographer, [[Fiona MacCarthy]], detected the Arts and Crafts philosophy even behind the [[Festival of Britain]] (1951), the work of the designer [[Terence Conran]] (b. 1931)&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014/&gt; and the founding of the British [[Crafts Council]] in the 1970s.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=603}}

==Outside England==

===Ireland===
The movement spread to Ireland, representing an important time for the nation's cultural development, a visual counterpart to the literary revival of the same time&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Gordon Bowe, ''The Irish Arts and Crafts Movement (1886-1925)'', Irish Arts Review Yearbook, 1990-91, pp. 172-185&lt;/ref&gt; and was a publication of Irish nationalism. The Arts and Crafts use of stained glass was popular in Ireland, with [[Harry Clarke]] the best-known artist and also with [[Evie Hone]]. The architecture of the style is represented by the [[Honan Chapel]] (1916) in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in the grounds of [[University College Cork]]. Other architects practicing in Ireland included Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] (Heywood House in Co. Laois, Lambay Island and the [[Irish National War Memorial Gardens]] in Dublin) and Frederick 'Pa' Hicks ([[Malahide Castle]] estate buildings and round tower). Irish Celtic motifs were popular with the movement in silvercraft, carpet design, book illustrations and hand-carved furniture.

===Scotland===

The beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808–77). His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]], (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] (1834–1904) was one of the first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lyons, ''Christopher Dresser: The People Designer - 1834–1904'' (Antique Collectors' Club, 2005), {{ISBN|1851494553}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement had an "extraordinary flowering" in Scotland where it was represented by the development of the '[[Glasgow Style]]' which was based on the talent of the [[Glasgow School of Art]].  Celtic revival took hold here, and motifs such as the Glasgow rose became popularised. [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] and the Glasgow School of Art were to influence others worldwide.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dublin"&gt;Nicola Gordon Bowe and Elizabeth Cumming, ''The Arts And Crafts Movements in Dublin and Edinburgh''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental Europe===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}

In continental Europe, the revival and preservation of national styles was an important motive of Arts and Crafts designers; for example, in Germany, after unification in 1871 under the encouragement of the ''Bund für Heimatschutz'' (1897)&lt;ref&gt;Ákos Moravánszky, ''Competing visions: aesthetic invention and social imagination in Central European Architecture 1867-1918'', Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Vereinigte Werkstätten für Kunst im Handwerk'' founded in 1898 by Karl Schmidt; and in Hungary [[Károly Kós]] revived the vernacular style of [[Transylvania]]n building. In central Europe, where several diverse nationalities lived under powerful empires (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia), the discovery of the vernacular was associated with the assertion of national pride and the striving for independence, and, whereas for Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain the ideal style was to be found in the medieval, in central Europe it was sought in remote peasant villages.&lt;ref&gt;Andrej Szczerski, "Central Europe", in Karen Livingstone and Linda Parry (eds.), ''International Arts and Crafts'', London: V&amp;A Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Till en liten vira.jpg|thumb|The Swedish artists [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Karin Bergöö Larsson]] were inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement when designing their home.]]
Widely exhibited in Europe, the Arts and Crafts style's simplicity inspired designers like [[Henry van de Velde]] and styles such as [[Art Nouveau]], the Dutch [[De Stijl]] group, [[Vienna Secession]], and eventually the [[Bauhaus]] style. Pevsner regarded the style as a prelude to [[Modernism]], which used simple forms without ornamentation.&lt;ref name="pevsner" &gt;Nikolaus Pevsner, ''Pioneers of Modern Design'', Yale University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-300-10571-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Arts and Crafts activity in continental Europe was in [[Belgium]] in about 1890, where the English style inspired artists and architects including can de Velde, [[Gabriel Van Dievoet]], [[Gustave Serrurier-Bovy]] and a group known as ''[[La Libre Esthétique]]'' (Free Aesthetic).

Arts and Crafts products were admired in Austria and Germany in the early 20th century, and under their inspiration design moved rapidly forward while it stagnated in Britain.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=183}} The [[Wiener Werkstätte]], founded in 1903 by [[Josef Hoffmann]] and [[Koloman Moser]], was influenced by the Arts and Crafts principles of the "unity of the arts" and the hand-made. The [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Association of Craftsmen) was formed in 1907 as an association of artists, architects, designers, and industrialists to improve the global competitiveness of German businesses and became an important element in the development of [[modern architecture]] and industrial design through its advocacy of standardized production. However, its leading members, van de Velde and [[Hermann Muthesius]], had conflicting opinions about standardization. Muthesius believed that it was essential were Germany to become a leading nation in trade and culture. Van de Velde, representing a more traditional Arts and Crafts attitude, believed that artists would forever "protest against the imposition of orders or standardization," and that "The artist ... will never, of his own accord, submit to a discipline which imposes on him a canon or a type." {{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=189}}

In Finland, an idealistic artists' colony in [[Helsinki]] was designed by [[Herman Gesellius]], [[Armas Lindgren]] and [[Eliel Saarinen]],&lt;ref name="grove"/&gt; who worked in the [[National Romantic style]], akin to the British [[Gothic Revival]].

In [[Hungary]], under the influence of Ruskin and Morris, a group of artists and architects, including [[Károly Kós]], [[Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch]] and Ede Toroczkai Wigand, discovered the [[folk art]] and vernacular architecture of [[Transylvania]]. Many of Kós's buildings, including those in the [[Budapest Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden|Budapest zoo]] and the [[Wekerle estate]] in the same city, show this influence.&lt;ref&gt;Széleky András, ''Kós Károly'', Budapest, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, [[Viktor Hartmann]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], [[Yelena Polenova]] and other artists associated with [[Abramtsevo Colony]] sought to revive the quality of medieval Russian [[decorative arts]] quite independently from the movement in Great Britain.

In Iceland, [[Sölvi Helgason]]'s work shows Arts and Crafts influence.

In the United States, the Arts and Crafts style initiated a variety of attempts to reinterpret European Arts and Crafts ideals for Americans. These included the "Craftsman"-style architecture, furniture, and other decorative arts such as designs promoted by [[Gustav Stickley]] in his magazine, ''The Craftsman'' and designs produced on the Roycroft campus as publicized in Elbert Hubbard's ''The Fra''.  Both men used their magazines as a vehicle to promote the goods produced with the Craftsman workshop in Eastwood, NY and Elbert Hubbard's [[Roycroft]] campus in [[East Aurora, NY]]. A host of imitators of Stickley's furniture (the designs of which are often mislabelled the "[[American Craftsman|Mission Style]]") included three companies established by his brothers.

The terms ''[[American Craftsman]]'' or ''Craftsman style'' are often used to denote the style of architecture, interior design, and decorative arts that prevailed between the dominant eras of [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] in the USA, or approximately the period from 1910 to 1925.  The movement was particularly notable for the professional opportunities it opened up for women as artisans, designers and entrepreneurs who founded and ran, or were employed by, such successful enterprises as the [[Kalo Shops]], [[Rookwood Pottery]], and [[Tiffany Studios]]. In Canada, the term ''Arts and Crafts'' predominates, but ''Craftsman'' is also recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/acam/hd_acam.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art: Monica Obniski, "The Arts and Crafts Movement in America" |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=1972-02-20 |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Europeans tried to recreate the virtuous crafts being replaced by industrialisation, Americans tried to establish a new type of virtue to replace heroic craft production: well-decorated middle-class homes. They claimed that the simple but refined aesthetics of Arts and Crafts decorative arts would ennoble the new experience of industrial consumerism, making individuals more rational and society more harmonious. The American Arts and Crafts movement was the aesthetic counterpart of its contemporary political philosophy, [[progressivism]]. Characteristically, when the Arts and Crafts Society began in October 1897 in Chicago, it was at [[Hull House]], one of the first American [[settlement house]]s for social reform.&lt;ref name="Obniski"&gt;Obniski.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arts and Crafts ideals disseminated in America through journal and newspaper writing were supplemented by societies that sponsored lectures.&lt;ref name="Obniski"/&gt; The first was organized in Boston in the late 1890s, when a group of influential architects, designers, and educators determined to bring to America the design reforms begun in Britain by William Morris; they met to organize an exhibition of contemporary craft objects. The first meeting was held on January 4, 1897, at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] (MFA) in Boston to organize an exhibition of contemporary crafts. When craftsmen, consumers, and manufacturers realised the aesthetic and technical potential of the applied arts, the process of design reform in Boston started. Present at this meeting were General Charles Loring, Chairman of the Trustees of the MFA; [[William Sturgis Bigelow]] and [[Denman Ross]], collectors, writers and MFA trustees; Ross Turner, painter; [[Sylvester Baxter]], art critic for the ''Boston Transcript''; Howard Baker, [[Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr.|A.W. Longfellow Jr.]]; and Ralph Clipson Sturgis, architect.

The first American Arts and Crafts Exhibition began on April 5, 1897, at [[Copley Hall, Boston]]{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} featuring more than 1000 objects made by 160 craftsmen, half of whom were women. Some of the advocates of the exhibit were Langford Warren, founder of Harvard's School of Architecture; Mrs. Richard Morris Hunt; Arthur Astor Carey and Edwin Mead, social reformers; and [[Will H. Bradley]], graphic designer. The success of this exhibition resulted in the incorporation of The Society of Arts and Crafts (SAC), on June 28, 1897, with a mandate to "develop and encourage higher standards in the handicrafts." The 21 founders claimed to be interested in more than sales, and emphasized encouragement of artists to produce work with the best quality of workmanship and design. This mandate was soon expanded into a credo, possibly written by the SAC's first president, [[Charles Eliot Norton]], which read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This Society was incorporated for the purpose of promoting artistic work in all branches of handicraft. It hopes to bring Designers and Workmen into mutually helpful relations, and to encourage workmen to execute designs of their own. It endeavors to stimulate in workmen an appreciation of the dignity and value of good design; to counteract the popular impatience of Law and Form, and the desire for over-ornamentation and specious originality. It will insist upon the necessity of sobriety and restraint, or ordered arrangement, of due regard for the relation between the form of an object and its use, and of harmony and fitness in the decoration put upon it.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, Beverly Kay. ''The Craftsman and the Critic: Defining Usefulness and Beauty in the Arts and Crafts-era Boston.'' University of Massachusetts Press, 2009. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also influential were the [[Roycroft]] community initiated by [[Elbert Hubbard]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[East Aurora, New York]], [[Joseph Marbella]],  utopian communities like [[Byrdcliffe Colony]] in [[Woodstock, New York]], and [[Rose Valley, Pennsylvania]], developments such as [[Mountain Lakes, New Jersey]], featuring clusters of bungalow and chateau homes built by Herbert J. Hapgood, and the contemporary studio craft style. [[Studio pottery]]—exemplified by the [[Grueby Faience Company]], [[Newcomb Pottery]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Marblehead Pottery]], [[Teco pottery]], [[Overbeck Sisters|Overbeck]] and [[Rookwood pottery]] and [[Mary Chase Perry Stratton]]'s [[Pewabic Pottery]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], as well as the art [[tile]]s made by [[Ernest A. Batchelder]] in [[Pasadena, California]], and idiosyncratic furniture of [[Charles Rohlfs]] all demonstrate the influence of Arts and Crafts.

====Architecture and Art====
The "[[Prairie School]]" of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[George Washington Maher]] and other architects in Chicago, the [[Country Day School movement]], the [[bungalow]] and [[ultimate bungalow]] style of houses popularized by [[Greene and Greene]], [[Julia Morgan]], and [[Bernard Maybeck]] are some examples of the American Arts and Crafts and [[American Craftsman]] style of architecture. Restored and landmark-protected examples are still present in America, especially in California in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], and the sections of other towns originally developed during the era and not experiencing post-war urban renewal. [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]], Prairie School, and the '[[California bungalow]]' styles of residential building remain popular in the United States today.

As theoreticians, educators, and prolific artists in mediums from printmaking to pottery and pastel, two of the most influential figures were [[Arthur Wesley Dow]] (1857-1922) on the East Coast and [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos]] (1882-1954) in California.  Dow, who taught at [[Columbia University]] and founded the Ipswich Summer School of Art, published in 1899 his landmark ''Composition'', which distilled into a distinctly American approach the essence of Japanese composition, combining into a decorative harmonious amalgam three elements: simplicity of line, "notan" (the balance of light and dark areas), and symmetry of color.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Nancy E. and Jessie Poesch| title=Arthur Wesley Dow and American arts &amp; crafts| date=1999|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.| location=New York, NY|isbn=0810942178|pages=55–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His purpose was to create objects that were finely crafted and beautifully rendered.  His student de Lemos, who became head of the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], Director of the [[Stanford University]] Museum and Art Gallery, and Editor-in-Chief of the ''School Arts Magazine'', expanded and substantially revised Dow's ideas in over 150 monographs and articles for art schools in the United States and Britain.&lt;ref name="edwardsrw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Pedro de Lemos, Lasting Impressions: Works on Paper| date=2015|publisher=Davis Publications Inc.| location=Worcester, Mass.|isbn=9781615284054|pages=4–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his many unorthodox teachings was his belief that manufactured products could express "the sublime beauty" and that great insight was to be found in the abstract "design forms" of pre-Columbian civilizations.

===Asia===
In Japan, [[Yanagi Sōetsu]], creator of the [[Mingei]] movement which promoted folk art from the 1920s onwards, was influenced by the writings of Morris and Ruskin.&lt;ref name=mingei&gt;Elisabeth Frolet, Nick Pearce, Soetsu Yanagi and Sori Yanagi, ''Mingei: The Living Tradition in Japanese Arts'', Japan Folk Crafts Museum/Glasgow Museums, Japan: Kodashani International, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Arts and Crafts movement in Europe, Mingei sought to preserve traditional crafts in the face of modernising industry.

The movement ... represents in some sense a revolt against the hard mechanical conventional life and its insensibility to beauty (quite another thing to ornament). It is a protest against that so-called industrial progress which produces shoddy wares, the cheapness of which is paid for by the lives of their producers and the degradation of their users. It is a protest against the turning of men into machines, against artificial distinctions in art, and against making the immediate market value, or possibility of profit, the chief test of artistic merit. It also advances the claim of all and each to the common possession of beauty in things common and familiar, and would awaken the sense of this beauty, deadened and depressed as it now too often is, either on the one hand by luxurious superfluities, or on the other by the absence of the commonest necessities and the gnawing anxiety for the means of livelihood; not to speak of the everyday uglinesses to which we have accustomed our eyes, confused by the flood of false taste, or darkened by the hurried life of modern towns in which huge aggregations of humanity exist, equally removed from both art and nature and their kindly and refining influences.

Many of the leaders of the Arts and Crafts movement were trained as architects (e.g. William Morris, A. H. Mackmurdo, C. R. Ashbee, W. R. Lethaby) and it was on building that the movement had its most visible and lasting influence.

[[Red House (London)|Red House]], in [[Bexleyheath]], London, designed for Morris in 1859 by architect [[Philip Webb]], exemplifies the early Arts and Crafts style, with its well-proportioned solid forms, wide porches, steep roof, pointed window arches, brick fireplaces and wooden fittings.  Webb rejected classical and other revivals of historical styles based on grand buildings, and based his design on British [[vernacular architecture]], expressing the texture of ordinary materials, such as stone and tiles, with an asymmetrical and picturesque building composition.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/british_galleries/bg_styles/Style09a/index.html |title=Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London suburb of [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]], built mainly in the 1880s and 1890s, has about 360 Arts and Crafts style houses and was once famous for its [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic]] residents. Several [[Almshouse]]s were built in the Arts and Crafts style, for example, [[Whiteley Village]], Surrey, built between 1914 and 1917, with over 280 buildings, and the [[Dyers Almshouses]], Sussex, built between 1939 and 1971. [[Letchworth Garden City]], the first garden city, was inspired by Arts and Crafts ideals.&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014/&gt; The first houses were designed by [[Richard Barry Parker|Barry Parker]] and [[Raymond Unwin]] in the [[vernacular]] style popularized by the movement and the town became associated with high-mindedness and simple living. The sandal-making workshop set up by [[Edward Carpenter]] moved from Yorkshire to Letchworth Garden City and [[George Orwell]]'s jibe about "every fruit-juice drinker, nudist, sandal-wearer, sex-maniac, Quaker, 'Nature Cure' quack, pacifist, and feminist in England" going to a socialist conference in Letchworth has become famous.&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, ''The Road to Wigan Pier''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Garden design==
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
[[Gertrude Jekyll]] applied Arts and Crafts principles to garden design. She worked with the English architect, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]], for whose projects she created numerous landscapes, and who designed her home ''[[Munstead Wood]]'', near Godalming in Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;Tankard, Judith B. and Martin A. Wood. Gertrude Jekyll at Munstead Wood. Bramley Books, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Jekyll created the gardens for ''Bishopsbarns'',&lt;ref name="HEBishopsbarns"&gt;{{NHLE|num=1256793 |desc=Bishopsbarns|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the home of York architect [[Walter Brierley]], an exponent of the Arts and Crafts movement and known as the "Lutyens of the North".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/goddards-house-and-garden/documents/download-the-goddards-the-art-of-design-leaflet.pdf |title=The Art of Design |website=www.nationaltrust.org.uk| accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden for Brierley's final project, ''[[Goddards House and Garden|Goddards]]'' in York, was the work of George Dillistone, a gardener who worked with Lutyens and Jekyll at ''[[Castle Drogo]]''.&lt;ref name="HE1000452"&gt;{{NHLE|num=1000452 |desc=Castle Drogo park and garden|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''Goddards'' the garden incorporated a number of features that reflected the arts and crafts style of the house, such as the use of hedges and [[herbaceous border]]s to divide the garden into a series of outdoor rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/goddards-house-and-garden/features/the-gardens-at-goddards- |title=The Gardens at Goddards|website=www.nationaltrust.org.uk| accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable Arts and Crafts garden is ''[[Hidcote Manor Garden]]'' designed by [[Lawrence Johnston]] which is also laid out in a series of outdoor rooms and where, like ''Goddards'', the landscaping becomes less formal further away from the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hidcote/features/the-garden-at-hidcote |title=The Garden at Hidcote|website=www.nationaltrust.org.uk| accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of Arts and Crafts gardens include ''[[Hestercombe House|Hestercombe Gardens]]'', ''[[Lytes Cary|Lytes Cary Manor]]'' and the gardens of some of the architectural examples of arts and crafts buildings (listed above).

==Art education==
Morris's ideas were adopted by the [[New Education Movement]] in the late 1880s, which incorporated handicraft teaching in schools at Abbotsholme (1889) and [[Bedales]] (1892), and his influence has been noted in the social experiments of [[Dartington Hall]] during the mid-20th century.{{sfn|MacCarthy 1994|p=603}}

Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain were critical of the government system of art education based on design in the abstract with little teaching of practical craft. This lack of craft training also caused concern in industrial and official circles, and in 1884 a Royal Commission (accepting the advice of William Morris) recommended that art education should pay more attention to the suitability of design to the material in which it was to be executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morrissociety.org/publications/JWMS/AU94.11.1.HarveyPress.pdf Charles Harvey and Jon Press, "William Morris and the Royal Commission on Technical Instruction", ''Journal of the William Morris Society''  11.1, August 1994, pp. 31-34] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105132211/http://www.morrissociety.org/publications/JWMS/AU94.11.1.HarveyPress.pdf |date=2015-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first school to make this change was the [[Birmingham Art School|Birmingham School of Arts and Crafts]], which "led the way in introducing executed design to the teaching of art and design nationally (working in the material for which the design was intended rather than designing on paper). In his external examiner's report of 1889, Walter Crane praised Birmingham School of Art in that it 'considered design in relationship to materials and usage.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://fineart.ac.uk/institutions.php?idinst=9 "Birmingham Institute of Art and Design" fineart.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the direction of Edward Taylor, its headmaster from 1877 to 1903, and with the help of [[Henry Payne (artist)|Henry Payne]] and [[Joseph Southall]], the Birmingham School became a leading Arts-and-Crafts centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Everitt|first=Sian|title=Keeper of Archives|url=http://fineart.ac.uk/institutions.php?idinst=9|work=Birmingham Institute of Art and Design|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other local authority schools also began to introduce more practical teaching of crafts, and by the 1890s Arts and Crafts ideals were being disseminated by members of the Art Workers Guild into art schools throughout the country. Members of the Guild held influential positions: Walter Crane was director of the [[Manchester School of Art]] and subsequently the [[Royal College of Art]]; F.M. Simpson, [[Robert Anning Bell]] and C.J.Allen were respectively professor of architecture, instructor in painting and design, and instructor in sculpture at [[Liverpool School of Art]]; Robert Catterson-Smith, the headmaster of the Birmingham Art School from 1902-1920, was also an AWG member; [[W. R. Lethaby]] and [[George Frampton]] were inspectors and advisors to the [[London County Council]]'s (LCC) education board and in 1896, largely as a result of their work, the LCC set up the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] and made them joint principals.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt; Until the formation of the Bauhaus in Germany, the Central School was regarded as the most progressive art school in Europe.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=179}} Shortly after its foundation, the [[Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts]] was set up on Arts and Crafts lines by the local borough council.

As head of the Royal College of Art in 1898, Crane tried to reform it along more practical lines, but resigned after a year, defeated by the bureaucracy of the [[Board of Education]], who then appointed Augustus Spencer to implement his plan. Spencer brought in Lethaby to head its school of design and several members of the Art Workers' Guild as teachers.&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;Stuart Macdonald, ''The History and Philosophy of Art Education'', London: University of London Press, 1970.  {{ISBN|0 340 09420 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years after reform, a committee of inquiry reviewed the RCA and found that it was still not adequately training students for industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Departmental Committee on the Royal College of Art'', HMSO, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; In the debate that followed the publication of the committee's report, C.R.Ashbee published a highly critical essay, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art'', in which he called for the system of art education to be completely dismantled and for the crafts to be learned in state-subsidised workshops instead.&lt;ref&gt;C.R.Ashbee, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art?'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Foreman Day]], an important figure in the Arts and Crafts movement, took a different view in his dissenting report to the committee of inquiry, arguing for greater emphasis on principles of design against the growing orthodoxy of teaching design by direct working in materials. Nevertheless, the Arts and Crafts ethos thoroughly pervaded British art schools and persisted, in the view of the historian of art education, Stuart MacDonald, until after the Second World War.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt;

[[File:Tokyo detention center.jpg|thumb|[[Tokyo Detention House]], which houses one of Japan's seven [[execution chamber]]s]]
[[Capital punishment]] is a legal penalty in [[Japan]]. It is applied in practice only for murder, and executions are carried out by [[hanging]].

Death sentences are usually reserved for cases of multiple murders, though some single murderers are occasionally hanged. Generally, the only time single murderers are executed is when they commit particularly heinous or depraved acts of murder, such as murder during a kidnapping, [[torture murder]] or murder during the commission of another violent crime. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIST OF DEFENDANTS WHO ARE UNDER SENTENCE OF DEATH IN JAPAN|quote=Death penalty for a single murder is quite rare.|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918045645/http://www.jiadep.org/Chart-DeathRow_files/page481_1.html|date=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3140723/Japan-executes-murderer-arranged-two-strangers-dark-net-kidnap-rob-woman-bludgeoned-death-case-identified-them.html | publisher=dailymail.co.uk | title=Japan executes murderer who arranged with two strangers on ‘the dark net’ to kidnap and rob a woman… then bludgeoned her to death in case she identified them | date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Criminal punishment in Edo-period Japan}}
Beginning in about the 4th century, Japan became increasingly influenced by the Chinese judicial system, and gradually adopted a system of different punishments for different crimes, including the death penalty. However, beginning in the [[Nara period]], cruel punishments and the death penalty were used less and less, probably as a result of the influence of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings, and the death penalty was abolished completely in the [[Heian period]]. The death penalty was not used for the next 300 years, until the [[Genpei War]].

During the following [[Kamakura period]], capital punishment was widely used and methods of execution became increasingly cruel, and included burning, boiling and crucifixion, among many others. During the [[Muromachi period]], even harsher methods of execution came into use, such as upside-down [[crucifixion]], impalement by spear, sawing, and dismemberment with oxen or carts. Even minor offenses could be punished by death, and family members and even neighbors could be punished along with the offender. These harsh methods, and liberal use of the death penalty, continued throughout the [[Edo period]] and into the early [[Meiji period]], but due to the influence of [[Confucianism]], offenses against masters and elders were increasingly punished much more harshly than offenses against those of lower rank. [[Torture]] was used to extract confessions. In 1871, as the result of a major reform of the penal code, the number of crimes punishable by death was decreased and excessively cruel torture and flogging were abolished. In 1873, another revision resulted in a further reduction in the number of crimes punishable by death, and methods of execution were restricted to beheading or hanging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=8fZKH4cbcmQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=capital+punishment+in+japan#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| author=Petra Schmidt| title=Capital punishment in Japan| publisher=Brill| year=2001| pages=9–24| isbn=9004124217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System==

===Sentencing guideline – Nagayama Standard===
In Japan, the courts follow guidelines laid down in the trial of [[Norio Nagayama]], a 19-year-old from a severely disadvantaged background, who committed four separate robbery-murders in 1968 and was finally [[hanging|hanged]] in 1997. The Tokyo High Court originally gave him a life term, but in 1983 the [[Supreme Court of Japan]] held it was an error, and quashed this sentence.

The court ruled that the penalty shall be decided in consideration of the degree of criminal liability and balance of justice based on a nine-point set of criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/adv/wol/dy/opinion/society_080514.htm|title=Death Penalty for Hikari City Mother-Child Murder Case|author=Prof. Norio Takahashi|publisher=Daily Yomiuri Online|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though technically not a precedent, this guideline has been followed by all subsequent capital cases in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T101116005495.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130219004313/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T101116005495.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 February 2013|title=Lay judges wept over sentence|author=Eiji Kaji|publisher=Daily Yomiuri Online|accessdate=19 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nine criteria are as follows:
#Degree of viciousness
#Motive
#How the crime was committed; especially the manner in which the victim was killed.
#Outcome of the crime; especially the number of victims.
#Sentiments of the bereaved family members.
#Impact of the crime on Japanese society.
#Defendant's age (in Japan, the age of majority is 20).
#Defendant's previous criminal record.
#Degree of remorse shown by the defendant.

The number of victims killed is the most important criterion for imposition of the death penalty. A death sentence handed down for a single murder (previous convictions included) is considered "extraordinary".

In 2012, a research institute affiliated with the Supreme Court issued a report on application of the death penalty from 1980 to 2009. The study found that, while prosecutors very rarely demand capital punishment in cases of single murder, it was handed down in 32% of those cases. On the other hand, prosecutors seek the death penalty almost systematically in cases of multiple homicide, and it is handed down in 59% of cases of double-murder and 79% of cases where three or more victims have been killed.

The study also found that the death penalty was handed down in all cases of convicted murderers who killed again after being released on parole from [[Life imprisonment|life prison terms]], and in all [[robbery]]-murder cases with three or more people slain.

Furthermore, in five of 10 kidnap-for-ransom cases in which one person was killed, the defendants were sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To advise lay judges, Supreme Court institute cites death penalty precedents |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120725a2.html |publisher=japantimes.co.jp |accessdate=April 11, 2016 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020185521/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120725a2.html |archivedate=20 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judicial process ===
Since May 2009, district courts try capital cases using the [[Lay judges in Japan|lay judge system]], where three professional judges sit with six randomly chosen citizens. Five votes of nine-member court, including at least one professional judge, are required for issuing a conviction and any punishment, including death.

Japan has a [[civil law legal system]], therefore, appeal courts retry both facts and law. High courts retry cases with only three judges and no lay judges, and can either reduce a death sentence to life or raise a life sentence to death. Ultimately, a five-member petty bench of the Supreme Court has the final say on the penalty, Article 411 of Code of Criminal Procedure allowing it to remand the case or change the punishment if the one handed down by the high court is "seriously unfair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Code of Criminal Procedure |url=http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?id=1983&amp;vm=04&amp;re=02 |publisher=japaneselawtranslation.go.jp |accessdate= April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In only three cases since 1945, the Supreme Court ruled a high court-imposed life sentence too lenient, and ordered a retrial for death sentence. Among them are [[Norio Nagayama]] and [[Takayuki Fukuda]], both under 20 at time of crime. The third case was that of a man convicted of murdering an elderly woman for robbery shortly after being paroled from a life sentence imposed for a similar crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIST OF DEFENDANTS WHO ARE UNDER SENTENCE OF DEATH IN JAPAN|url=http://www.jiadep.org/Chart-DeathRow_files/page481_1.html|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stays of execution ===
According to Article 475 of the Japanese Code of Criminal Procedure, the death penalty must be executed within six months after the failure of the prisoner's final appeal upon an order from the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Minister of Justice]]. However, the period requesting retrial or pardon is exempt from this regulation. Therefore, in practice, the typical stay on death row is between five and seven years; a quarter of the prisoners have been on death row for over ten years. For several, the stay has been over 30 years ([[Sadamichi Hirasawa]] died of natural causes at the age of 95, after awaiting execution for 32 years&lt;ref name="sahrdc"&gt;{{cite web | title=Japan Hanging on to Death Penalty|work=South Asia Human Rights Documentation Centre|url=http://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/hrfeatures/HRF75.htm | accessdate=28 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Death row ===
Japanese death row inmates are imprisoned inside the [[Prison|detention centres]] of [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]], [[Nagoya]], [[Sendai]], [[Fukuoka]], [[Hiroshima]] and [[Sapporo]]. Despite the city having a high court, [[Tachikawa, Tokyo|Tachikawa]] Detention Centre and [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]] Detention Centre are not equipped with execution chambers; executions administered by the Tachikawa and Takamatsu High Courts are carried out in the Tokyo and Osaka Detention Centres. Those on death row are not classified as prisoners by the Japanese justice system and the facilities in which they are incarcerated are not referred to as prisons. Inmates lack many of the rights afforded to other Japanese prisoners. The nature of the regime they live under is largely up to the director of the detention centre, but it is usually significantly harsher than normal Japanese prisons. Inmates are held in solitary confinement and are forbidden to communicate with their fellows. They are permitted two periods of exercise a week, are not allowed televisions and may only possess three books.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;Bruce Wallace – {{cite news|title=Awaiting Death's Footsteps|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/02/world/fg-deathrow2 | accessdate=7 June 2006 | first=Bruce | last=Wallace | page=1 | date=2 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners are not allowed to exercise within their own cells.&lt;ref name="latimes4"&gt;Bruce Wallace – {{cite news|title=Awaiting Death's Footsteps|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/02/world/fg-deathrow2/4 | page=4| accessdate=7 June 2006 | first=Bruce | last=Wallace | date=2 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prison visits, both by family members and legal representatives, are infrequent and closely supervised.

===Execution===
The execution warrant is signed by the Minister of Justice after internal consultations within the justice ministry. Once the final approval is signed, the execution will take place within five days.

By statute, the execution cannot take place on a national holiday, Saturday, Sunday, or between 31 December and 2 January.

The death penalty is carried out by [[hanging]] in an execution chamber within the detention centre. When an execution order has been issued, the condemned prisoner is informed in the morning of their execution. The condemned is given a choice of the last meal. The prisoner's family and legal representatives, and also the general public, are informed only afterwards. Since 7 December 2007, the authorities have been releasing the names, natures of crime, and ages of executed prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7132123.stm | work=BBC News | title=Secrecy of Japanese executions | date=7 December 2007 | accessdate=28 April 2010 | first=Chris | last=Hogg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of hanging is the [[Hanging#Long drop|long drop]], causing a quick death by neck fracture.

As of August 2014, the number of inmates on death row was 126. Of them, 89 are applying for their cases to be reopened and 25 are requesting amnesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/08/29/national/crime-legal/two-inmates-hanged-10th-11th-executions-since-abe-took-office/|title=Takefuji arsonist, ex-yakuza hanged for eight murders|work=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death sentences for minors==
Having signed both the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], which forbid any execution for crimes committed under the age of 18, Japan sets the minimum age for capital punishment at 18 (Juvenile Law § 51). Although death sentences for minors (defined in Japan as those under age 20) are rare, those who commit capital crimes at age 18 or 19 may be legally sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/ritsnet/tobira/column01.html |script-title=ja:年長少年に対する死刑の是非 |language=Japanese |accessdate=17 December 2008 |last=Adachi |first=Kōji |publisher=[[Ritsumeikan University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216163954/http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/ritsnet/tobira/column01.html |archivedate=16 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine juvenile criminals have received death sentences that were finalised since 1966: [[Misao Katagiri]], Kiyoshi Watanabe, Mitsuo Sasanuma, Fumio Matsuki, Sumio Kanno, Tsuneo Kuroiwa, [[Norio Nagayama]], Teruhiko Seki, and Takayuki Mizujiri. Seven of them have already been executed, and Watanabe and Seki, both of whom killed four people when they were 19 years old, remain on death row awaiting execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 山口の母子殺害で最高裁「死刑回避は不当」|work= [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] Morning Edition|page= 13|date= 21 June 2006|language= Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2013|2}}, the most recent juvenile death sentence was given to [[Takayuki Fukuda]], passed by the Hiroshima High Court on 22 April 2008, and upheld by the Supreme Court on 20 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matsutani |first=Minoru |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120221a1.html |title=Double-killer as minor will face gallows |publisher=The Japan Times |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month after his 18th birthday he killed and then raped a woman, along with murdering her baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mother, baby killer sentenced to hang |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23581893-663,00.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602034744/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C23581893-663%2C00.html |archivedate=2 June 2008 |accessdate=13 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 山口・母子殺害事件「死刑回避は不当」|work= Yomiuri Shimbun Morning Edition|page= 1|date= 21 June 2006|language= Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public debate ==
The Japanese public has generally supported the death penalty. The government regularly monitors support for the death penalty, the last survey in 2015 showing 80.3% of the public believing that the death penalty is "permissible" and 9.7% that it should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/01/25/national/cabinet-office-poll-80-of-respondents-think-death-penalty-permissible/#.Vwt20KSLTIV Cabinet Office poll: 80% of respondents think death penalty 'permissible'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428021833/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/01/25/national/cabinet-office-poll-80-of-respondents-think-death-penalty-permissible/#.Vwt20KSLTIV |date=28 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a 2003 trial, a Tokyo prosecutor presented the court a petition with 76,000 signatures as part of his case for a death sentence.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;[[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]] – {{cite news|title=Why Japan Still Has the Death Penalty|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11306-2005Jan15.html| accessdate=7 June 2006 | first=Charles | last=Lane | date=16 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1980s, four death penalties that were waiting since the period just after World War II were quashed and exonerated by the Supreme Court. Charles Lane of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' claims that this embarrassed the Ministry of Justice, whose officials sincerely believed that such mistakes by the system were almost impossible.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt; Between 1989 and 1993, four successive ministers of justice refused to authorise executions, which amounted to an informal [[UN moratorium on the death penalty|moratorium]].

The British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' claimed that the death penalty was effectively suspended on 17 September 2009 with the appointment of [[Keiko Chiba]], who was a member of anti-death penalty MPs caucus group, as [[Minister of Justice (Japan)|Minister of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6840248.ece|title=Japan's death penalty effectively scrapped with arrival of Keiko Chiba|last=Parry|first=Richard Lloyd|authorlink=Richard Lloyd Parry|date=19 September 2009|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=21 September 2009 | location=London | archivedate = 28 September 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090928042224/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6840248.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no official policy statement was made in this regard. Chiba only stated that "I will cautiously handle (the cases) based on the duties of the justice minister."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Author |first=No |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090918a6.html |title=Chiba urges death penalty debate &amp;#124; The Japan Times |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date=2009-09-18 |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times''' speculation was conclusively disproved when Chiba signed two death warrants and personally witnessed the execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100728x1.html |title=Pair hanged; Chiba attends as witness |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010025556/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100728x1.html |archivedate=10 October 2012 |accessdate=13 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support ===
Supporters say that capital punishment is applied infrequently and only to those who have committed the most extreme of crimes—a single act of murder does not attract capital punishment without additional aggravating circumstances such as rape or robbery. In the 1956 debate, Japanese serial killer [[Genzo Kurita]], who engaged in rape and [[necrophilia]], was cited by the Diet as an example of a murderer whose crimes were atrocious enough to merit death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | script-title=ja:第024回国会 法務委員会公聴会 第2号 | language=Japanese | publisher=[[National Diet Library]] | url=http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/SENTAKU/sangiin/024/0640/02405100640002c.html | date=10 May 1956 | accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is more the rarity of extreme crimes in Japanese society rather than an unwillingness of the authorities to carry out executions that has caused so few executions to take place.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;

Since executions resumed in 1993, a rise in street crime during the 1990s, the [[sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway]] in 1995 and several high-profile murders{{fix|text=such as?}} have hardened attitudes amongst the public and the judiciary. Since 1999, there have been a series of cases in which criminals sentenced to life imprisonment have been given the death penalty after prosecutors successfully appealed to high courts.

On 18 March 2009, a district court sentenced to death two men for the [[murder of Rie Isogai]].&lt;ref name="jt20090319"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090319a1.html| title = Net strangers to hang for slaying|work = The Japan Times|date = 19 March 2009| accessdate = 10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fumiko Isogai, who lost her only child in this crime, launched a campaign to call for the death penalty on the three murderers in September 2007.&lt;ref name="yomiuri20090312"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://chubu.yomiuri.co.jp/news_top/090312_0.htm| script-title=ja:被告の言葉　「耐えられない軽さ」―無念の叫び 闇サイト殺人 18日判決(5)|work = The Yomiuri Shimbun|date = 12 March 2009| accessdate = 10 April 2009|last=Ishihara|first=A.|last2=Matsuda|first2=S.|last3=Kajiura|first3=K.|language = Japanese}}{{dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within ten days, her petition was signed by 100,000 citizens.&lt;ref name="jcast20071004"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/3332690/| script-title=ja:ネット上で死刑求める署名 10日間で10万人！ 集まる|work = J-Cast News|date = 4 October 2007| accessdate = 10 April 2009|language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She presented her petition for the death penalty with some 150,000 signatures to the District Public Prosecutors' Office of Nagoya on 23 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.47news.jp/CN/200710/CN2007102301000634.html |script-title=ja:極刑求め15万人が署名 闇サイト殺人、地検に提出 |work=47 News |publisher=Press Net Japan |agency=Kyodo |date=23 October 2007 |accessdate=19 April 2009 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717094704/http://www.47news.jp/CN/200710/CN2007102301000634.html |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 318,000 citizens had signed her petition by December 2008.&lt;ref name="yomiuri20090312"/&gt;

Although single murderers rarely face a death sentence in Japan, [[Takeshi Tsuchimoto]], a [[criminal law]] scholar at [[Hakuoh University]] and former [[prosecutor]] of the Supreme Public Prosecutors' Office, expected that the recent trend toward harsher punishments, backed by the growing public support for capital punishment, would encourage the court to sentence Kanda and Hori (of the Rie Isogai case) to death.&lt;ref name="jcast20071004"/&gt; Major national newspapers published editorials in support of this unorthodox judgment on the premise that capital punishment is retained.&lt;ref name="shasetsu"&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ja:社説ウオッチング：闇サイト殺人判決 死刑制度前提に容認 |work=The Mainichi Shimbun |date=22 March 2009 |url=http://mainichi.jp/select/opinion/watching/news/20090322ddm004070039000c.html? |language=Japanese |accessdate=10 April 2009 |last=Morishima |first=M. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406030947/http://mainichi.jp/select/opinion/watching/news/20090322ddm004070039000c.html |archivedate=6 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' and the ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'', both major national liberal newspapers, wrote in editorials that the general public favored the judgment, and the ''[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun|Nikkei]]'' lent his support to it.&lt;ref name="shasetsu"/&gt; The ''[[Sankei Shimbun]]'', a major national paper on the right, aggressively evaluated the judgement with a phrase "a natural and down-to-earth judgment of great significance".&lt;ref name="shasetsu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sankei.jp.msn.com/affairs/trial/090319/trl0903190309002-n1.htm |script-title=ja:闇サイト殺人 常識に沿った死刑判断だ |date=19 March 2009 |language=Japanese |accessdate=13 April 2009 |work=The Sankei Shimbun |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321070054/http://sankei.jp.msn.com/affairs/trial/090319/trl0903190309002-n1.htm |archivedate=21 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Tokyo Shimbun]]'' expressed that capital punishment would be the inevitable sentence in consideration of the brutality of the murder and the pain that the victim's family felt.&lt;ref name="shasetsu"/&gt; They also noted, however, that it would be difficult for citizen judges to determine whether death penalty would be appropriate in this kind of case under the [[juries in Japan|lay judge system]], which would be started in May 2009.&lt;ref name="shasetsu"/&gt; [[Hiroshi Itakura]], a criminal law scholar at [[Nihon University]], said that this decision could be a new criterion for capital punishment under the lay judge system.&lt;ref name="jt20090319"/&gt; However, one of the two men sentenced to death in the Isogai case had his sentence reduced to life imprisonment on appeal, and the Supreme Court refused to raise the punishment to death (but he was later sentenced to death in another murder case). The other defendant sentenced to death did not appeal and was hanged in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/12/15/national/crime-legal/man-serving-life-murder-gets-death-sentence-another-slaying/#.Vwt41KSLTIV |title = Man serving life for murder gets death sentence for another slaying |publisher=japantimes.co.jp |accessdate=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
[[Amnesty International]] argues that the Japanese justice system tends to place great reliance on confessions, even ones obtained under duress. According to a 2005 Amnesty International report:

{{quote|Most have been sentenced to death on the basis of confessions extracted under duress. The potential for miscarriages of justice is built into the system: confessions are typically extracted while suspects are held in ''[[daiyo kangoku]]'', or "substitute prisons", for interrogation before they are charged. In practice these are police cells, where detainees can be held for up to 23 days after arrest, with no state-funded legal representation. They are typically interrogated for 12 hours a day: no lawyers can be present, no recordings are made, and they are put under constant pressure to confess. Once convicted, it is very difficult to obtain a re-trial and prisoners can remain under sentence of death for many years.&lt;ref name="amnesty2"&gt;{{cite web | title=Urgent Action in Focus, August 2005|work=Amnesty International|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGACT600162005?open&amp;of=ENG-JPN| accessdate=28 May 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060524095424/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGACT600162005?open&amp;of=ENG-JPN |archivedate = 24 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Amnesty also reports allegations of abuse of suspects during these interrogations. There are reports of physical abuse, sleep deprivation and denial of food, water and use of a toilet.&lt;ref name="amnesty2" /&gt; One of its biggest criticisms is that inmates usually remain for years (and sometimes decades) on death row without ever actually being informed of the date of their execution prior to the date itself, so inmates suffer due to the uncertainty of not knowing whether or not any given day will be their last. According to Amnesty International, the intense and prolonged stress means many inmates on death row have poor mental health, suffering from the so-called [[death row phenomenon]]. The failure to give advanced notice of executions has been stated by the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] to be incompatible with articles 2, 7 and 10 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].&lt;ref name="sahrdc" /&gt;

South Asia Human Rights Documentation Centre claims that the issuance of death warrants by the Ministry of Justice may be politically motivated. In 1997, [[Norio Nagayama]], a prisoner who committed the first of several murders as a juvenile, was executed during the sentencing phase of "Sakakibara Seito" for the [[Kobe child murders]], also resulting in a high-profile juvenile murder trial – an attempt, according to South Asia Human Rights Documentation Centre, to show that the harshest punishment could be administered to juveniles.&lt;ref name="sahrdc" /&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the execution of [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]] after the [[Akihabara massacre]] was claimed to be a similar case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/world/asia/18japan.html?ref=world|title=Japan Hangs Three Convicted Killers|publisher=The New York Times|date=18 June 2008|accessdate=2008-06-18 | first=Martin | last=Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Attorneys in Japan#Bar association membership|Japanese Federation of Bar Associations]] also says that capital punishment should be abolished in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hiyama|first=Hiroshi|title=Japan executes first prisoners since 2010|url=https://news.yahoo.com/japan-executes-first-prisoners-since-2010-reports-022914958.html%3b_ylc%3dX3oDMTNuZmlpdG01BF9TAzIxNDU4NjgyNzQEYWN0A21haWxfY2IEY3QDYQRpbnRsA3VzBGxhbmcDZW4tVVMEcGtnAzIzNWVjYmM2LTdjZDAtMzI0My04NmEyLTljNDNlMThmY2I0YwRzZWMDbWl0X3NoYXJlBHNsawNtYWlsBHRlc3QD%3b_ylv%3d3|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=AFP|date=29 March 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are found among the Soninke, the various Manding-speaking populations (including the Bambara, Malinke and Khassonke), the Wolof, Tukulor, Senufo, Minianka, Dogon, Songhay, and most Fulani, Moorish and Tuareg populations".&lt;/ref&gt; These caste systems feature endogamy, hierarchical status, inherited occupation, membership by birth, pollution concepts and restraints on commensality.&lt;ref name="Levine2014p56"/&gt;

The specifics of the caste systems in Africa vary among the ethnic groups. Some societies have a rigid and strict caste system with embedded slavery, whereas others are more diffuse and complex. Countries in [[Africa]] that have societies with caste systems include [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Senegal]], [[Gambia]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Niger]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cameroon]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Algeria]], [[Nigeria]], [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Somalia]], [[Djibouti]], [[Eritrea]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V4DEXhUF9csC&amp;pg=PA9 ''Human Rights Watch''] Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamari 1991p13c"/&gt; While it is unclear when and how the caste systems developed in Africa, they are not ancient and likely developed sometime between the 9th century and 15th century in various ethnic groups, probably in conjunction with the institution of slavery.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamari 1991p13c"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tal Tamari (2005), Kingship and Caste in Africa: History, Diffusion and Evolution, Editor: Declan Quigley in The Character of Kingship, Berg, {{ISBN|978-184-520-2910}}, pages 141-169&lt;/ref&gt;

==East Africa==
===Amhara people===
{{main|Amhara people}}
The social stratification of the [[Amhara people]] of [[Ethiopia]] includes castes. According to [[Donald N. Levine|Donald Levine]] – a professor of Sociology specializing in Ethiopian society, the Amhara society has consisted of high-ranking clans, low-ranking clans, caste groups (artisans), and slaves. The Amhara caste system was hierarchically higher than its lowest slaves strata.&lt;ref name="Levine2014p56"/&gt;

The Amhara caste system consisted of: (1) endogamy, (2) hierarchical status, (3) restraints on commensality, (4) pollution concepts, (5) each caste has had a traditional occupation, and (6) inherited caste membership.&lt;ref name="Levine2014p56"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald N. Levine|title=Greater Ethiopia: The Evolution of a Multiethnic Society| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZHeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56 |year=2014| publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-22967-6|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caste system has been a rigid, endogamous and occupationally closed social stratification among Amhara and other Afro-Asiatic-speaking Ethiopian ethnic groups. However, some state it as an economically closed, endogamous class system or as occupational minorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Teshale Tibebu|title=The Making of Modern Ethiopia: 1896-1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeD4gruvuNEC&amp;pg=PA67|year=1995|publisher=The Red Sea Press|isbn=978-1-56902-001-2|pages=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others such as the historian David Todd state that this system can be unequivocally labelled as caste-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Todd | first=David M. | title=Caste in Africa? | journal=Africa | publisher=Cambridge University Press  | volume=47 | issue=04 | year=1977 | pages=398–412 | doi=10.2307/1158345 }}&lt;br&gt;Dave Todd (1978), "The origins of outcastes in Ethiopia: reflections on an evolutionary theory", ''Abbay'', Volume 9, pages 145-158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lewis | first=Herbert S. | title=Historical problems in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa | journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | volume=96 | issue=2 | year=2006 | pages=504–511 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1962.tb50145.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Niall Finneran |title=The Archaeology of Ethiopia| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNGIzz1VJH0C&amp;pg=PA14 |year=2013| publisher=Routledge |isbn=1-136-75552-7| pages=14–15}}, Quote: "Ethiopia has, until fairly recently, been a rigid feudal society with finely grained perceptions of class and caste".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Borana people===
The [[Borana people]] are found in southern Ethiopia, Somalia and northeastern Kenya. They have historically had castes, among which the hunters and artisans have constituted the depressed strata.&lt;ref name=Lewis504/&gt; These are endogamous castes each with a specialized inherited occupation, and include a strata that constitutes outcastes. They are found in virtually every Cushitic or Semitic community of this region. These castes are neither [[Negro]]id nor Bushmanoid by physical features or their first language.&lt;ref name=Lewis504&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lewis | first=Herbert S. | title=Historical Problems in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa | journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | volume=96 | issue=2 | year=2006 | pages=504–511 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1962.tb50145.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lower castes of the Borana people, states [[Herbert S. Lewis|Herbert Lewis]] – a professor of Anthropology specializing on East African societies, show no physical differences from the noble castes of Somalia and Somalilands. Other than endogamy and occupational differences between the castes, their ritual, social and political positions are different, as are the beliefs held by each about the nature of the other.&lt;ref name=Lewis510/&gt; For example, the castes have long considered each other as ritually impure, and food prepared by either nobles or artisans castes is considered a taboo to others. Similarly, traditionally, the craftsman and the noble are ritually forbidden to enter the house of the other. Low caste people are expected not to handle farm equipment or cattle.&lt;ref name=Lewis510&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lewis | first=Herbert S. | title=Historical Problems in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa | journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | volume=96 | issue=2 | year=2006 | pages=510–511 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1962.tb50145.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ethiopia, the outcaste groups include the [[Weyto people|Weyto]], who live on the shores of [[Lake Tana]] and are despised for eating [[hippopotamus]] meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kassam | first=Aneesa | last2=Bashuna | first2=Ali Balla | title=Marginalisation of the Waata Oromo Hunter–Gatherers | journal=Africa | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=74 | issue=02 | year=2004 | pages=194–216 | doi=10.3366/afr.2004.74.2.194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brenzinger1992p398"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthias Brenzinger|title=Language Death: Factual and Theoretical Explorations with Special Reference to East Africa | year=1992|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-087060-2|pages=398–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oromo people===
The [[Oromo people]] are the largest ethnic group in [[Ethiopia]], also found in northern Kenya and Somalia, with an estimated total population of over 35 million.&lt;ref name=ciaoromo&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/et.html Ethiopia: People &amp; Society], CIA Factbook (2016), See total population and % Oromo ethnic group&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|page=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Teseme17&gt;{{cite book |last=Ta'a |first=Tesema |date=2006 |title=The Political Economy of an African Society in Transformation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XwN2JdMYM4C |location= |publisher=[[Otto Harrassowitz Verlag]] |page=17 |isbn=978-3-447-05419-5 |access-date=21 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other ethnic groups in the Horn of Africa and East Africa, Oromo people regionally developed social stratification consisting of four hierarchical strata. The highest strata were the nobles called the ''Borana'', below them were the ''Gabbaro'' (some 17th to 19th century Ethiopian texts refer them as the ''dhalatta''). Below these two upper castes were the despised castes of artisans, and at the lowest level were the slaves.&lt;ref&gt;J. Abbink (1985), Review: Oromo Religion. Myths and Rites of the Western Oromo of Ethiopia by Lambert Bartels, Journal: Anthropos, Bd. 80, H. 1./3. (1985), pages 285-287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Trevor William Baxter|author2=Jan Hultin|author3=Alessandro Triulzi|title=Being and Becoming Oromo: Historical and Anthropological Enquiries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xmp2lsKlqx0C |year=1996|publisher=Nordic Africa Institute|isbn=978-91-7106-379-3|pages=254–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Islamic [[Kingdom of Jimma]], the Oromo society's caste strata predominantly consisted of endogamous, inherited artisanal occupations.&lt;ref name=lewis53/&gt;&lt;ref name=haberland105/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Quirin | first=James | title=The Process of Caste Formation in Ethiopia: A Study of the Beta Israel (Felasha), 1270-1868 | journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies | publisher=Boston University African Studies Center | volume=12 | issue=2 | year=1979 | page=235 | doi=10.2307/218834 }};&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal | last=Haji | first=Abbas | title=Pouvoir de bénir et de maudire : cosmologie et organisation sociale des Oromo-Arsi | journal=Cahiers d'études africaines | publisher=PERSEE | volume=37 | issue=146 | year=1997 | pages=290, 297, context: 289–318 | doi=10.3406/cea.1997.3515|language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each caste group has specialized in a particular occupation such as iron working, carpentry, weapon making, pottery, weaving, leather working and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Asafa Jalata (2010), [http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_socopubs/6 Oromo Peoplehood: Historical and Cultural Overview], Sociology Publications and Other Works, University of Tennessee Press, page 12, see "Modes of Livelihood"  section&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=haberland105&gt;[[:de:Eike Haberland|Eike Haberland]] (1993), Hierarchie und Kaste : zur Geschichte und politischen Struktur der Dizi in Südwest-Äthiopien, Stuttgart : Steiner, {{ISBN|978-3515055925}} (in German), pages 105-106, 117-119&lt;/ref&gt;

The castes in the Oromo society have had a designated name, such as ''Tumtu'' were smiths, ''Fuga'' were potters, ''Faqi'' were tanners and leatherworkers, ''Semmano'' for weavers, ''Gagurtu'' were bee keepers and honey makers, ''Watta'' were hunters and foragers.&lt;ref name=lewis53&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert S.

By the 19th century, Oromo slaves were sought after and a major part of slaves sold in Gondar and Gallabat slave markets at Ethiopia-Sudan border, as well as the Massawa and Tajura markets on the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Gervase Clarence-Smith|title=The Economics of the Indian Ocean Slave Trade in the Nineteenth Century| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsNcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-135-18214-4|pages=93–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Segal|author-link=Ronald Segal|title=Islam's Black Slaves: The Other Black Diaspora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdh3GYnXvrAC&amp;pg=PA154| year=2002|publisher=MacMillan|isbn=978-0-374-52797-6|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somali people===
The [[Somalis]] are a Muslim ethnic group of between 15 and 20 million people, constituting the largest ethnicity in Somalia, many of whom also live in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Djibouti.&lt;ref name="AppiahGates2010p395"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marian Aguiar|editor=Anthony Appiah and Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have historically exhibited social stratification that has included embedded castes referred to as ''Higal'' (or ''Higalki'', ''Argobba'').&lt;ref name="Levine2014p62"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald N. Levine|title=Greater Ethiopia: The Evolution of a Multiethnic Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZHeBQAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-22967-6|pages=62, 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=larajasse1972/&gt; The upper noble strata has been called ''Gob'' (or Asha), while the lower servile strata have been referred to as ''Sáb''.&lt;ref name=larajasse1972&gt;Е. de Larajasse (1972), Somali-English and Somali-English Dictionary, Trubner, pages 119, 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=besteman123/&gt; The three main Somali castes are called ''Tumal'' (sometimes spelled ''Tomal''), ''Midgan'' and ''Yibir'' (sometimes spelled ''Yebir''). These fell outside of the traditional clan structure.&lt;ref name="Reese2008p139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine2014p62"/&gt; The castes have been endogamous, a person born into it inherited its occupation. The ''Midgan'' have been the hunters, ''Tumal'' were the smiths, pottery and leatherworking caste, and the ''Yibir'' have been the saddle and prayer mat makers and magician caste.&lt;ref name="Reese2008p139"&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott Steven Reese|title=Renewers of the Age: Holy Men and Social Discourse in Colonial Benaadir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fb4UYAPUhYoC&amp;pg=PA139|year=2008|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-16729-3|pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heather Marie Akou|title=The Politics of Dress in Somali Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Eg-b6EQt-cC&amp;pg=PA20|year=2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn= 978-0253223135|pages=20–23}}, Quote: "Many of these items were not made by nomads but by a caste of artisans called the ''Saab'', considered subservient (...) The ''Yebir'', also members of the Saab caste, were responsible for crafting amulets (hardas), prayer mats, and saddles, and for performing rituals designed to protect nomads from snakes and scorpions, illnesses and harm during marriage and childbirth".&lt;/ref&gt; Below the castes have been the Somali [[Bantu people|Bantu]] ''Jareer'' community, and these have been descendants of former slaves, including those who were runaway and emancipated slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed A. Eno and Abdi M. Kusow (2014), ''Racial and Caste Prejudice in Somalia'', Journal of Somali Studies, Iowa State University Press, Volume 1, Issue 2, pages 93-94, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mohamed Eno and Abdi Kusow, the Somali caste communities are ethnically indistinguishable from each other, but upper castes have stigmatized the lower ones with mythical narratives such as they being of unholy origins or being engaged in dirty occupations.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed A. Eno and Abdi M. Kusow (2014), ''Racial and Caste Prejudice in Somalia'', Journal of Somali Studies, Iowa State University Press, Volume 1, Issue 2, page 95, Quote: "Unlike that of the Somali Jareer Bantu, the history, social, and ethnic formation of the Somali caste communities is hardly distinguishable from that of other Somalis. The difference is that these communities are stigmatized because mythical narratives claim that (a) they are of unholy origin, and (b) they engage in denigrated occupations."&lt;/ref&gt; The four strata social system – high lineage, low lineage, caste groups and slaves – found among the Somalis has been common in the Horn of Africa region, states [[Donald N. Levine|Donald Levine]], and is also found among ethnic groups such as Afar, Amhara, Borana, Leqa, Sidamo, Kefa, Janjero and other peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald N. Levine|title=Greater Ethiopia: The Evolution of a Multiethnic Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZHeBQAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-22967-6|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Catherine Besteman - a professor of Anthropology, the widespread purchase of non-Somali African slaves during the medieval age helped structure the complex status hierarchy among the Somalis.&lt;ref name="Besteman2014p52"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Besteman|title=Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bce7AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52|year=2014|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-9016-5|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, adds Besteman, the Somali people from the upper strata have also been egalitarian in matters of clan leadership, while they have included concepts of social status, inferiority and exclusion of ''Sáb'' and slaves.&lt;ref name=besteman123/&gt; In the northern regions where Somalis are traditionally found, states Iaon Lewis, Somali communities have traditionally distinguished between the artisanal Somali castes and their slaves, but in the south they have blurred these distinctions.&lt;ref name=besteman123&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Besteman|title=Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bce7AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52|year=2014|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-9016-5|pages=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=I.

The castes among Somali people have also existed in other east and northeast African ethnic groups. In east African ethnic groups, such as the [[Oromo people]] for example, cognates to Somali castes have been recorded in 16th century texts, states Cornelius Jaenen.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius J. Jaenen (1956), ''The Galla or Oromo of East Africa'', Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, University of Chicago Press, Vol. 12, No. 2 (Summer, 1956), pages 171-190&lt;/ref&gt; The table below illustrate some alternate terms for castes mirroring the Somali [[Madhiban]] in other ethnic groups that share this region with the Somali people.&lt;ref name="Levine2014p196"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald N. Levine|title=Greater Ethiopia: The Evolution of a Multiethnic Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZHeBQAAQBAJ |date=10 December 2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-22967-6|pages=195–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, equivalent terms for castes in other northeast and east African ethnic groups mirror other castes such as the [[Tomal]] and the [[Yibir]] of Somali people.&lt;ref name="Levine2014p196"/&gt;

===Moors===
The Muslim Moors society in the Maghreb parts of the [[North Africa]] was traditionally (and still is, to some extent) stratified. According to Rebecca Popenoe – a professor of Anthropology, while the Islamic scriptures do not dictate a caste system, and while caste systems are not divinely ordained, the Moors believe that castes are "fundamentally different sorts of people" and find the root of the caste system in early Islam.&lt;ref name="Popenoe2004p114"/&gt; The slave caste in the Moors' belief system have descended from Bilal, the slave of Muhammad, while the artisan castes are descendants of those "who refused to accept Allah".&lt;ref name="Popenoe2004p114"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rebecca Popenoe|title=Feeding Desire: Fatness, Beauty, and Sexuality Among a Saharan People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJcg11g9yRYC&amp;pg=PA114|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-28095-2|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mauritanian context, the Kafa'a doctrine has been developed as a justification for considering family status before marriage, annulment of marriages between unequal people, and endogamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marinos Diamantides|author2=Adam Gearey|title=Islam, Law and Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WG-pAgAAQBAJ |year=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-67565-2|pages=138–139, 155–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moors have owned slaves for centuries.

The Haratin of [[Mauritania]], states Joseph Hellweg – a professor of Anthropology specializing on West African studies, were part of a social caste-like hierarchy that likely developed between 1300 to 1500 CE because of a [[Bedouin]] legacy. The "Hassan" monopolized the occupations related to war and politics, the "Zwaya" ([[Zawāyā|Zawaya]]) the religious roles, the "Bidan" (White Moors) owned property and held slaves (Haratins, Black Moors), and the slaves constituted the lowest of the social strata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph R Hellweg|editor=Mark Juergensmeyer and Wade Clark Roof|title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwJzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA761|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6656-5|page=761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these were castes, endogamous, with hereditary occupations and where the upper strata collected tribute (''horma'') from the lower strata of Mauritanian society, considered them socially inferior, and denied them the right to own land or weapons thereby creating a socio-economically closed system.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony G.

When applied to West African societies, it is used in the very general meaning of the division of societies into hierarchically rank-endogamous-occupational groups; the relation between these groups having ritual as well as economic significance. (...) To understand Mauritanian society, one must understand its ethnic groups, its tribes, socio-economic classes and its castes. The Hassaniya speakers who predominate over the majority of the country except along the river are divisible into two crucial subgroups - the Bidan or white Moors and the Haratin or black Moors. The Bidan are traditionally further divided into Z'waya (religious or "marabout" groups), Hassan (warrior groups), Zenaga (free tributary groups), Mu'allamin (craftsmen) and Ighyuwn (entertainers) (...)&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[Hassaniya Arabic]] speakers in southern [[Morocco]] and Mauritania, states Sean Hanretta – a professor of African History, the term ''Bidan'' is a "caste synecdoche" that refers to ''Hassani'' (warrior) and ''Zwaya'' (clerical) clans.

The Haratin were hierarchically higher than the ''`Abid'' (descendant of slaves) at the very bottom, but lower than ''Ahrar''.

===Tuareg people===
The [[Tuareg people]] are a large [[Berbers|Berber]] ethnic confederation found in North Africa.

In Tuareg hierarchical caste system, the nobles constitute the highest caste.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=16-17}} They are known in the Tuareg language as ''imúšaɣ'' (''Imajaghan'', "the proud and free" in Arabic&lt;ref name="Gates2010p499"/&gt;). The nobles had a monopoly on carrying arms and camels, were the warriors of the Tuareg regions.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=16}} They may have achieved their social status by subjugating other Tuareg castes, keeping arms to defend their properties and vassals. They have also collected tribute from their vassals. This warror nobility has traditionally married within their caste, not to individuals in strata below their own.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=16}} A collection of tribes, each led by a noble, forms a confederation called ''amanokal'', whose chieftain is elected from among the nobles by the tribal chiefs.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=16-17}}&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt; The chietain is the overlord during times of war, and receives tribute and taxes from tribes as a sign of their submission to his authority.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=20}}

The vassal-herdsmen are the second free strata within Tuareg society, occupying a position just below that of the nobles.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=17}} They are known as ''ímɣad'' (''Imghad'', singular ''Amghid'') in the Tuareg language.&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt; Although the vassals were also free, they did not own camels but instead kept donkeys and herds of goats, sheep and oxen. They pastured and tended their own herds as well those owned by the nobles of the confederation.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=17}} The vassal strata have traditionally paid an annual ''tiwse'', or tribute to the nobles as a part of their status obligations, and also hosted any noble who is traveling through their territory.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}} In late medieval era, states Prasse, this weapon monopoly broke down after regional wars took a heavy toll on the noble warrior strata, and thereafter the vassals carried weapons as well and were recruited as warriors.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}} After the start of the French colonial rule which dislodged the nobles from their powers over war and taxation, the Tuaregs belonging to the noble strata disdained tending cattle and tilling the land, seeking instead warrior or intellectual work.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}}

A semi-noble strata of the Tuareg people has been the endogamous religious clerics, the ''[[marabout]]s'' (Tuareg: ''Ineslemen'', a loan word that means Muslim in Arabic).{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}} After the adoption of Islam, they became integral to the Tuareg social structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stewart | first=C.

Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}}

According to the anthropologist Jeffrey Heath, Tuareg artisans belong to separate endogamous castes known as the ''Inhædˤæn'' (''Inadan'').&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt;{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=18}} These have included the blacksmith, jewelers, wood workers and leather artisan castes.&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt; They produced and repaired the saddles, tools, household items and other items for the Tuareg community. In Niger and Mali, where the largest Tuareg populations are found, the artisan castes were attached as clients to a family of nobles or vassals, and carried messages over distances for their patron family. They also are the ones who traditionally sacrifice animals during Islamic festivals.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=18}}

These social strata, like caste systems found in many parts of West Africa, included singers, musicians and story tellers of the Tuareg, who kept their [[oral tradition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David C.

Known to the Tuareg as agguta, they typically entertain at weddings (...)"&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the artisanal castes are unclear. One theory posits a Jewish derivation, a proposal that Prasse calls "a much vexed question".{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=18}} Their association with fire, iron and precious metals and their reputation for being cunning tradesman has led others to treat them with a mix of admiration and distrust.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=18}}

According to Rasmussen, the Tuareg castes are not only hierarchical, as each caste differs in mutual perception, food and eating behaviors. On this point, she relates an explanation by a smith on why there is endogamy among castes among Tuareg in Niger. The smith explained, "Nobles are like rice, Smiths are like millet, Slaves are like corn."&lt;ref&gt;Susan Rasmussen (1996), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3630236 Matters of Taste: Food, Eating, and Reflections on "The Body Politic" in Tuareg Society], Journal of Anthropological Research, University of Chicago Press, Volume 52, Number 1 (Spring, 1996), page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Tuareg areas of Algeria, a distinct tenant-peasant strata lives around oases known as ''izeggaghan'' (or ''hartani'' in Arabic).{{Sfn|Karl G.

The peasants tilled these fields, whose output they gave to the nobles after keeping a fifth part of the produce.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=19-20}} Their Tuareg patrons were usually responsible for supplying agricultural tools, seed and clothing. The peasants' origins are also unclear. One theory postulates that they are descendants of ancient people who lived in the Sahara before they were dominated by invading groups. Some speak a Songhay dialect along with Tuareg and Arabic. In contemporary times, these peasant strata have blended in with freed black slaves and farm arable lands together.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=19-20}}

According to the historian Starratt, the Tuareg evolved a system of slavery that was highly differentiated. They established strata among their slaves, which determined rules as to the slave's expected behavior, marriageability, inheritance rights if any, and occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Starratt | first=Priscilla Ellen | title=Tuareg slavery and slave trade | journal=Slavery &amp; Abolition | publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis | volume=2 | issue=2 | year=1981 | pages=83–113 | doi=10.1080/01440398108574825 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ikelan'' later became a bonded caste within Tuareg society.&lt;ref name="Nicolaisen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicolaisen|first1=Johannes|title=Ecology and Culture of the Pastoral Tuareg: With Particular Reference to the Tuareg of Ahaggar and Ayr|date=1963|publisher=National Museum of Copenhagen| page=16| url=https://www.google.com/books?id=hLUbAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Heath, the ''Bella'' in the Tuareg society were the slave caste whose occupation was rearing and herding livestock such as sheep and goats.&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt;

All criteria retained by specialists to defìne a caste group (Berreman, Pitt-Rivers, Vaughan), may be applied to them.

The Fulani castes are endogamous in nature, meaning individuals marry only within their caste. This caste system, however, wasn't as elaborate in places like northern [[Nigeria]], Eastern [[Niger]] or [[Cameroon]]. According to some estimates, by the late 19th century, slaves constituted about 50% of the population of the Fulɓe-ruled [[Adamawa Emirate]], where they were referred to as ''jeyaɓe'' (singular ''jeyado'').

=== Igbo people ===
The [[Igbo culture#Osu caste system|Osu caste system]] in [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Cameroon]] of the [[Igbo people]] can be traced back to [[Odinani]], the traditional Igbo religion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zg-CdmGkK4YC "The Osu Caste Discrimination in Igboland: Impact on Igbo Culture and Civilization"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the belief of many Igbo traditionalists that the Osus are people historically owned by deities, and are therefore considered to be a 'living sacrifice', an outcast, untouchable and sub-human (similar to the Roman practice of ''[[homo sacer]]''). This system received literary attention when it became a key plot point in ''[[No Longer at Ease]]'' by [[Chinua Achebe]].

People regarded as modern-day Osu in [[Igboland]] are descendants of individuals who volunteered and were sacrificed to the various gods. These fore-fathers pledged themselves and their descendants to these gods. They enjoyed protection and privileges but were segregated from ordinary folks. These Osu people married, fraternized and socialized among themselves. The practice continued to this day. An ordinary Igbo person would not marry or permit any of his relations to marry an Osu person. In a few instances where that has happened, every member of that non-Osu who married an Osu became infested and were regarded as Osu.

It can be said that the only aspect of Igbo life that keeps the Osu segregation intact is marriage. An Osu could and could only marry a fellow Osu, and no more. It is a taboo and abhorent for an Osu to marry a non-Osu - love or lust being immaterial.

Some suggest that due to the introduction of modernization, the Osu system is gradually leaving [[Igboland]] and tradition. The influence of [[Christianity]] (specifically [[Roman Catholicism]]) has caused [[Odinani]] to start slowly disappearing from [[Igboland]]. Obinna, in 2012, reports that in the Igbo community - especially in [[Enugu State|Enugu]], [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Imo State|Imo]], [[Abia State|Abia]], [[Ebonyi State|Ebonyi]], [[Edo State|Edo]] and [[Delta state|Delta]] states - Osu caste system remains a social issue. The Osu caste is determined by one's birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into the Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=Obinna1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contesting identity: the Osu caste system among Igbo of Nigeria|author=Elijah Obinna|pages=111–121|journal=African Identities|volume=10|issue=1|year=2012|doi=10.1080/14725843.2011.614412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mande people ===
Among the [[Mande people|Mande]] societies in [[Mali]], [[Senegal]], [[the Gambia]], [[Guinea]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Ghana]], people are divided by occupation and ethnic ties. The highest hierarchy in the Mande caste system, the Horon (nobles/freeborn), are traditionally farmers, fisherman, warriors and animal breeders, the lowest caste are the Jonow, a "slave" caste, made up of people whose ancestors were enslaved by other Africans during tribal wars. An important feature of this system are castes based on trade, such as [[blacksmith]]s and [[griot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Griots at War: Conflict, Conciliation, and Caste in Mande", by Barbara G.

The Mandinka society, states Arnold Hughes – a professor of West African Studies and African Politics, has been "divided into three endogamous castes – the freeborn (''foro''), slaves (''jongo''), and artisans and praise singers (''nyamolo'').&lt;ref name=hughesstrata&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arnold Hughes|author2=Harry Gailey|title=Historical Dictionary of the Gambia, 3rd Edition|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=M9MUAQAAIAAJ |year=1999| publisher=Scarecrow|isbn=978-0-8108-3660-0|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freeborn castes are primarily farmers, while the slave strata included labor providers to the farmers, as well as leather workers, pottery makers, metal smiths, griots and others.&lt;ref name=gatesmandinka/&gt; The Mandinka Muslim clerics and scribes have traditionally been a separate endogamous occupational caste called ''[[Jakhanke people|Jakhanke]]'', with their Islamic roots traceable to about the 13th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zachary Valentine Wright|title=Living Knowledge in West African Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2h2oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|year=2015|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-28946-8|pages=63–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elisabeth Boesen|author2=Laurence Marfaing|title=Les nouveaux urbains dans l'espace Sahara-Sahel: un cosmopolitisme par le bas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NO6dACLQPaMC&amp;pg=PA243|year=2007|publisher=Paris: KARTHALA|isbn=978-2-84586-951-6|pages=243 with footnote 7}}, Quote: "The Jakhanke, who now primarily speak Mandinka, have formed a specialized caste of Muslim clerics and educators since approximately the 13th century".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanneh1976p49"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sanneh | first=Lamin | title=The Origins of Clericalism in West African Islam | journal=The Journal of African History | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=17 | issue=01 | year=1976 | pages=49–72 | doi=10.1017/s0021853700014766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Factual accuracy|section|date=July 2018}}

For example, the Wolof, '''Serer''', and Pulaar-speaking Toucouleur are all caste societies."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Elizabeth Berg, Ruth Wan and Ruth Lau, Serer people in Senegal did not have a caste system before the [[Mandinka people|Malinka]] rulers conquered them and introduced a caste system.&lt;ref name="BergWan2009p73"/&gt; In other regions where Serer people are found, state JD Fage, Richard Gray and Roland Oliver, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] and [[Toucouleur people]]s introduced the caste system among the Serer people.&lt;ref name="FageGray1975p283"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.

The social stratification historically evidenced among the Serer people has been, except for one difference, very similar to those found among Wolof, Fulbe, Toucouleur and [[Mandinka people]]s found in [[Senegambia]]. They all have had strata of free nobles and peasants, artisan castes, and slaves. The difference is that the Serer people have retained a matrilineal inheritance system.&lt;ref name=Klein8&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin A. Klein|title=Islam and Imperialism in Senegal: Sine-Saloum, 1847-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPSrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA7|year=1968|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-0621-6|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Martin Klein – a professor of History specializing in African Studies, the caste systems among the Serer emerged as a consequence of the Mandinka people's Sine-Saloum guelowar conquest, and when the Serer people sought to adapt and participate in the new Senegambian state system.&lt;ref name=Klein8/&gt;

The third status, and the largest strata came to be the ''jambur'', or free peasants who lacked the power of the nobles. Below the ''jambur'' were the artisan castes, who inherited their occupation. These castes included blacksmiths, weavers, jewelers, leatherworkers, carpenters, griots who kept the [[oral tradition]] through songs and music. Of these all castes had a taboo in marrying a griot, and they could not be buried like others. Below the artisan castes in social status have been the slaves, who were either bought at slave markets, seized as captives, or born to a slave parent.&lt;ref name=klein11&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin A.

The Soninke strata have included a free category called ''Horro'' or ''Horon'', a caste system category called ''Namaxala'' or ''Nyaxamalo'', and slaves called ''Komo''.&lt;ref name=tal61/&gt;&lt;ref name=gomez24&gt;{{cite book|author= Michael Gomez|title=Pragmatism in the Age of Jihad: The Precolonial State of Bundu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfhGouf7_TsC |year=2002 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52847-4| page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanretta2009p37"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Hanretta|title=Islam and Social Change in French West Africa: History of an Emancipatory Community |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Fj79QbyRJUC&amp;pg=PA37 |year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89971-0|pages=37 with footnote 23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Jaara subgroup of the Soninke people, the nobility called ''Tunkanlenmu'' was another strata.&lt;ref name="Hanretta2009p37"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mamadou Lamine Diawara (1990), La Graine de la Parole: dimension sociale et politique des traditions orales du royaume de Jaara (Mali) du XVème au milieu du XIXème siècle, volume 92, Franz Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden GmbH, pages 35-37, 41-45&lt;/ref&gt;

The slaves were the largest strata, one at the bottom among the Soninke like other West African ethnic groups, and constituted up to half of the population. The slaves among the Soninke people were hierarchically arranged into three strata.&lt;ref name="Littlefield1991p79"/&gt; The village slaves were a privileged servile group who lived apart from the village and took orders from the village chief. The domestic slaves lived in with a family and could not be sold. The lowest level among slaves were the trade slaves who could be bought and sold.

=== Susu people ===
The [[Susu people]] are a West African [[ethnic group]], one of the [[Mandé peoples]] living primarily in [[Guinea]].&lt;ref name=britsusu&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Susu Susu people], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Influential in Guinea, smaller communities of Susu people are also found in the neighboring [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Guinea-Bissau]]. The Susu are a patrilineal society, predominantly Muslim, who favor endogamous cross-cousin marriages with polygynous households common.&lt;ref name=britsusu/&gt; They have a caste system like all Manding-speaking peoples of West Africa, where the artisans such as smiths, carpenters, musicians, jewelers and leatherworkers are separate castes, and believed to have descended from the medieval era slavery.&lt;ref name=britsusu/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamari 1991p13c"/&gt;

The Susu people, like other Manding-speaking peoples, have a caste system regionally referred to by terms such as ''Nyamakala'', ''Naxamala'' and ''Galabbolalauba''. According to David Conrad and Barbara Frank, the terms and social categories in this caste-based social stratification system of Susu people shows cases of borrowing from Arabic only, but the likelihood is that these terms are linked to Latin, Greek or Aramaic.&lt;ref name="ConradFrank1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David C.

Toucouleur society is divided into strict and rigid caste [[hierarchy|hierarchies]].&lt;ref name="Gates2010p500"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Hélène Le Divelec (1967), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41231043 Les "nouvelles" classes sociales en milieu urbain : le cas du Sénégal et celui du Nigéria du Nord], ''Civilisations'', Institut de Sociologie de l'Université de Bruxelles, Vol. 17, No. 3 (1967), pages 240-253; Quote: "In Senegal too the social structure is based on a rigid system of castes, each having a specific political, economic or ritual function. Caste antagonisms are much more important than tribal differences."&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest status among the five Toucouleur [[caste]]s is of the aristocratic leaders and Islamic scholars called ''Torobe''. Below them are the ''Rimbe'', or the administrators, traders and farmers. The ''Nyenbe'' are the artisan castes of the Toucouleur society. The fourth caste strata is called the ''Gallunkobe'' or the slaves or descendants of slaves "who have been freed".

The hierarchical social stratification has been an economically closed system, which historically has meant a marked inequality. Property and land has been exclusively owned by the upper caste members.&lt;ref name=brittukulor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tzeutschler | first=Gregory G.

=== Wolof people ===
The [[Wolof people]] are a West African Muslim ethnic group found in northwestern [[Senegal]], [[The Gambia]], and southwestern coastal [[Mauritania]].

The castes have also been hierarchal, with lowest level being those of griots.&lt;ref name=leonardo54/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Irvine (1989), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/645001 When Talk Isn't Cheap: Language and Political Economy], American Ethnologist, Vol. 16, No. 2 (May, 1989), pages 253-254&lt;/ref&gt; Their inherited inferiority has been culturally stated to be close to those of slaves (''jaams'' or ''kaals'').&lt;ref name=leonardo54&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonardo A.

Slaves have historically been a separate, endogamous group in the Wolof society.&lt;ref name=thiaw98/&gt; Slavery was either inherited by birth in the Wolof society, or were kidnapped, purchased as children from desperate parents during difficult times such as a famine, or slavery was imposed by the village elders as a punishment for offenses. By the early 18th-century, all sorts of charges and petty crimes resulted in the accused being punished to the slave strata. Slaves acquired by kidnapping, purchase or as captives of war were called ''jaam sayor'' in the Wolof society.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Klein (1977), "Servitude among the Wolof and Sereer of Senegambia", in Slavery in Africa: Historical and anthropological perspectives (Editors: Suzanne Miers, Igor Kopytoff), University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|978-0299073343}}, pages 343-344&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''geer'' or "freeborn" too had a hierarchical structure. At the top were the royal rulers, below them were the regionally or locally powerful noble lineages who controlled territories and collected tribute, and below them were commoner freeborn called the ''baadoolo'' or "lacking power".&lt;ref name=gamble16&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Gamble| author2= Linda K Salmon| author3= Ajhaji Hassan Njie|title= Peoples of The Gambia: The Wolof| year=1985| publisher= San Francisco State University Press|pages=15–17 |oclc= 16815490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The different strata of the Zarma-Songhai people have included the kings and warriors, the scribes, the artisans, the weavers, the hunters, the fishermen, the leather workers and hairdressers (Wanzam), and the domestic slaves (Horso, Bannye). Each caste reveres its own guardian spirit.&lt;ref name="Sardan1984p56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haour2013"/&gt; Some scholars such as John Shoup list these strata in three categories: free (chiefs, farmers and herders), servile (artists, musicians and griots), and the slave class.&lt;ref name=shoup265/&gt; The servile group were socially required to be endogamous, while the slaves could be emancipated over four generations.

The Zaghawa society has been socially stratified and has included castes. The upper strata has been of nobles and warriors, below them have been the traders and merchants, below whom have been the artisan castes called the ''Hadaheed'' (or ''Hadahid'').&lt;ref name="PeekYankah2004p59"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.

They form a sub-group of the Zaghawa known as ‘Hadaheed’ (plural of ‘Hadadi’, which means ‘blacksmith’, and derived from ‘Hadeed’ which means ‘iron’).3 Within the Hadaheed, men practice traditional forms of iron work and women pottery. They have done so as long as their history recalls, inheriting their knowledge and skills from generation to generation. Centuries ago, this group is thought to have been thralled by the Zaghawa, who had entered and settled into their territory. As slaves they were dispersed among Zaghawa families to perform primarily their iron and pottery work."&lt;/ref&gt; These castes have been endogamous, and their inherited occupations have included iron work, hunters, pottery, leatherwork and musicians such as drummers. The artisan work has traditionally been viewed within the Zaghawa society as dirty and of inferior status, being people from different pagan and Jewish roots who slowly assimilated into the Islamic society.&lt;ref name="PeekYankah2004p59"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip M.

They are a hereditary caste and are called Miro by the [[Fur people|Fur]]."&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest strata has been the slaves.

==Chronology: when did caste systems develop?==
The caste systems in Africa have been linked to the a pre-developed trading network, invasions from North Africa and the Middle East after the 7th century, followed by a slavery system that targeted the pagans. According to Susan McIntosh – a professor of Anthropology specializing in African societies, archeological evidence shows that Arabs and Berbers had expanded and established an integrated sub-Saharan trade and transport network with West Africa, building upon the pre-existing trade routes through Western Sudan.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan McIntosh|editor=Christopher R. DeCorse|title=West Africa During the Atlantic Slave Trade: Archaeological Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Fcr1HSZXNgC |year=2001|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0-7185-0247-8|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trade by 9th to 10th centuries, states McIntosh, included commodities and slaves. The reach of slave trading had extended into [[Ghana]] and the western Atlantic coast by the 11th century, and the slave raiding, capture, holding and trading systems became increasingly sophisticated in 13th and 14th century Mali Empire and 16th century Songhai Empire.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt;

As the practice of slavery grew, so did the caste system. Tamari suggests that a corollary of the rising slavery system was the development and growth of the caste system among numerous ethnic groups of Africa by about the 13th century.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamari 1991p13c"/&gt; McIntosh concurs with Tamari's reasoning approach, but disagrees with the dating. McIntosh states that the emergence of caste systems likely occurred much earlier in the West African societies such as Soninke, Mande, Malinke, Wolof, Serer, and others.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt; She places the development and spread of castes in these societies to about the 10th-century, because the slave capture, slave trade and slave holding by elite families was an established institution in West Africa by then, and slavery created a template for servile relationships and social stratification of human beings.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt;

The linguistic evidence suggests that stratification structure and words relating to caste system and slavery likely were shared between the many ethnic groups, and possibly some others such as the [[Dogon people]] of West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tal Tamari|editor=David C. Conrad and Barbara E.

==Comparison between castes of Africa and South Asia==
[[Louis Dumont]], the 20th-century author famous for his classic ''Homo Hierarchicus'', recognized the social stratification among the ethnic groups in West Africa, but suggested that sociologists should invent a new term for West African social stratification system.&lt;ref name="Haour2013"/&gt; Other scholars consider this a bias and isolationist because the West African system shares all elements in Dumont's system, including economic, ritual, spiritual, endogamous, elements of pollution, segregative and spread over a large region.&lt;ref name="Haour2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Haour|title=Outsiders and Strangers: An Archaeology of Liminality in West Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rx2vfGFGtQgC&amp;pg=PA95 |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969774-8|pages=95–97, 100–101, 90–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Declan Quigley|title=The character of kingship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbKAAAAAMAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-290-3|pages=20, 49–50, 115–117, 121–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall2011p15"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce S.

'''Chebo''' or '''Chabo''' is an [[ethnic group]] of the [[Debub Mirab Shewa Zone]]  and [[West Shewa Zone]] of the [[Oromia Region]] of south-west Ethiopia. The Chebo speak the [[Oromo language]] but originate from a mixture of the Gurage and Sidama ethnic groups. Like other [[Oromo people|Oromo groups]], their religion is [[Monophysite]] Christianity, but their ancestral religious practices continue beneath this.&lt;ref name=trimingham2013&gt;{{cite book |last=Trimingham |first=J. Spencer |title=Islam in Ethiopia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd3bAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT40 |year=2013 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-1-136-97029-0 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The livelihood of the Chebo-Inchini area of Oromia is described as [[enset]] (Ethiopian banana), [[barley]], and [[cattle]].&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;{{cite web |title=An Atlas of Ethiopian Livelihoods |publisher=USAID |page=124 |date=February 2016 |url=http://foodeconomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Atlas-Final-Web-Version-6_14.pdf}} The area is marked CIE and is at the centre of the map.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
One possible explanation of the name Chebo is from the Chebe plant, ''[[Croton gratissimus]]'' (lavender croton),&lt;ref&gt;''Tadele, et al. 2014''&lt;/ref&gt; which is normally burned during ''[[Meskel]]'' damera celebrations. 

Another possible explanation is the name of the area where the Chebo people live. Parts of the Debub Mirab Shewa Zone had been incorporated in Chebo and Gurage districts&lt;ref&gt;Kloos, et al. 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kloos, et al. 1989&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Shewa]] [[Provinces of Ethiopia|province]], as it was called prior to 1995.

==Notable Chebo==

* Habtegiorgis Dinagde - an advisor of zufan chilot of [[Haile Selassie]]

[[File:Crowd in street.jpg|thumb|A crowd of people returning from a show of fireworks spills into the street stopping traffic at the intersection of [[Fulton Street (Manhattan)|Fulton Street]] and Gold Street in [[Lower Manhattan]]]]
[[File:July 4 crowd at Vienna Metro station.jpg|thumb|A crowd leaves the [[Vienna (WMATA station)|Vienna]] station on the [[Washington Metro]] in 2006.]]

A '''crowd''' is a large [[group (sociology)|group of people]] that are gathered or considered together. A crowd may be definable through a common purpose or set of emotions, such as at a [[Demonstration (people)|political rally]], a [[Sport|sports event]], or during [[looting]] (this is known as a psychological crowd), or may simply be made up of many people going about their business in a busy area. The term "the crowd" may sometimes refer to the lower orders of people in general. 

==Terminology==
The term "crowd" is sometimes defined in contrast to other group nouns for collections of humans or animals, such as aggregation, audience, group, mass, mob, populous, public, rabble and throng.  Opinion researcher [[Vincent Price (educator)|Vincent Price]] compares masses and crowds, saying that "Crowds are defined by their shared emotional experiences, but masses are defined by their interpersonal isolation."&lt;ref name="glynn"&gt;Public Opinion By Carroll J. Glynn, Susan Herbst, Garrett J. O'Keefe, Robert Y. Shapiro&lt;/ref&gt;

In human sociology, the term "mobbed" simply means "extremely [[wikt:crowded|crowded]]", as in a busy [[shopping mall|mall]] or shop. "[[Mobbing]]", carries a more negative connotation associated with [[bullying]]. In [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|animal behaviour]], mobbing is a technique where many individuals of one species "gang up" on a larger individual of another species to drive them away. Mobbing behaviour is often seen in [[bird]]s.

==Social aspects==
Social aspects are concerned with the formation, management and [[crowd control|control of crowds]], both from the point of view of individuals and groups. Often crowd control is designed to persuade a crowd to align with a particular view (e.g., [[Demonstration (people)|political rallies]]), or to contain groups to prevent damage or mob behaviour.  Politically organised crowd control is usually conducted by law enforcement but on some occasions military forces are used for particularly large or dangerous crowds.

==Psychological aspects==
{{main|Crowd psychology}}
Psychological aspects are concerned with the psychology of the crowd as a group and the psychology of those who allow their will and emotions to be informed by the crowd (both discussed more comprehensively under [[crowd psychology]]), and other individual responses to crowds, such as [[claustrophobia]], [[agoraphobia]] and [[social anxiety]]. At a general level, crowd psychology is concerned with the behaviour and thought processes of individual crowd members and the crowd as a whole. Given the prevalence of crowd events, and the potential safety issues associated with such large gatherings of people, the topic is receiving increasing attention from agencies responsible for crowd management and also from governments.

Many studies on crowds have given insights on how crowds respond to different situations. One 2009 report highlighted many observable behaviors of crowds,&lt;ref name="cabinet"&gt;Challenger, R., Clegg, C. W., &amp; Robinson, M. A. (2009). [http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/understanding-crowd-behaviours-documents Understanding crowd behaviours. Multi-volume report for the UK Government’s Cabinet Office]. London: Cabinet Office. &lt;/ref&gt; including evidence that crowds are able to make united decisions regarding their direction and speed of movement, even if only a few of its members have the information required to make such decisions.&lt;ref name="cabinet"/&gt; The degree to which informed members can affect the crowd depends on their position within the group, with those in the crowd's core likely to have a greater influence.&lt;ref name="cabinet"/&gt;

Generally, researchers in crowd psychology have focused on the negative aspects of crowds,&lt;ref name="Ref.1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of psychology|author1=Reicher, Stephen|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2000|isbn=1-55798-650-9|editor=Alan E. Kazdin, editor in chief|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=374–377|authorlink=Crowd Behavior}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all crowds are volatile or negative in nature. For example, in the beginning of the socialist movement crowds were asked to put on their Sunday dress and march silently down the street. A more-modern example involves the sit-ins during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Crowds can reflect and challenge the held ideologies of their sociocultural environment. They can also serve integrative social functions, creating temporary communities.&lt;ref name="Ref.3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology|last=Greenberg|first=M.S.|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref.1" /&gt;

=== Types of crowd ===
{{main|Crowd psychology#Types}}&lt;p&gt;There is limited research into the types of crowd and crowd membership and there is no consensus as to the classification of types of crowds. Two recent scholars, Momboisse (1967)&lt;ref&gt;Momboisse, Raymond. ''Riots, Revolts, and Insurrection''. Springfield, Ill. Charles Thomas. 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; and Berlonghi (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Berlonghi, Alexander E. "Understanding and planning for different spectator crowds". ''Safety Science''. Volume 18, Number 4, February 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;239–247&lt;/ref&gt; focused upon purpose of existence to differentiate among crowds. Momboisse developed a system of four types: casual, conventional, expressive, and aggressive. Berlonghi classified crowds as spectator, demonstrator, or escaping, to correlate to the purpose for gathering.&lt;/p&gt;Another approach to classifying crowds is sociologist Herbert Blumer's system of emotional intensity. He distinguishes four types of crowds: casual, conventional, expressive, and acting. His system is dynamic in nature, presuming that a crowd changes its level of emotional intensity over time.

Crowds can be active (mobs) or passive (audiences). Active crowds can be further divided into aggressive, escapist, acquisitive, or expressive mobs.&lt;ref name="Ref.3" /&gt; Aggressive mobs are often violent and outwardly focused. Examples are football riots and the [[1992 Los Angeles Riots|L.A. Riots]] of 1992. Escapist mobs are characterized by a large number of panicked people trying to get out of a dangerous situation. Acquisitive mobs occur when large numbers of people are fighting for limited resources. An expressive mob is any other large group of people gathering for an active purpose. Civil disobedience, rock concerts, and religious revivals all fall under this category.&lt;ref name="Ref.3" /&gt;

Popularly called as the "Manchester of South India", the '''culture of Coimbatore''' is based on Kongu Vellala Gounder's community.Distinctly different from that of any other city in India. Being a cosmopolitan city, the culture of the city reflects its diverse population which has resulted in a unique blend. Though it is generally considered a traditional city, Coimbatore is more diverse and cosmopolitan than other cities in Tamil Nadu. Traditional music, dance and all other art forms of [[Tamil Nadu]] are very popular in the city. One can find a unique blend of culture from traditional foods to fast foods, from ancient temple architecture to modern high-rises and from classical music and dance to the growing nightlife in the city. Coimbatore and its people have a reputation for entrepreneurship.&lt;ref name="mc1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Coimbatore the next BPO city?|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/is-coimbatorenext-bpo-city_345659.html|accessdate=23 June 2010|newspaper=CNBC-TV18|date=5 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=German state keen to share expertise with Coimbatore |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2007/01/22/stories/2007012200821500.htm|accessdate=23 June 2010|newspaper=Business Line|date=22 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine==
[[File:Dosa with chutney and sambar traditionally served in banana leaf.jpg|thumb|200px|Dosa with chutney and sambar traditionally served in banana leaf]]

Coimbatore cuisine is predominantly [[south Indian]] with [[rice]] as its base. However, the population of Coimbatore is multi-cultural due to the influx of migrant population from various regions of the country. Most locals still retain their rural flavour, with many restaurants serving food over a [[banana leaf]]. [[Indian cuisine|North Indian]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] and [[Continental breakfast|continental]] cuisines are also available. [[Mysore pak]] (a sweet made from [[lentil]] flour and [[ghee]]), [[idly]], [[dosa]], [[Halwa]] (a sweet made of different ingredients like milk, wheat, rice).The Annapoorna Gowrishankar Hotels is a gem of this region known for its high quality vegetarian food and their Sambar ( The sambar for all its branches around Coimbatore are prepared in a single large batch and then delivered to the branches, thus the taste remains consistent). Biryani is also popular among the locals. Apart from this Coimbatore has a very active street food culture, thanks to the migratory North Indian population that settled down here a few generation ago, in fact a streetfood that is popular all over Tamil Nadu The Kaazhaan has its origins here in Coimbatore, it is usually prepared by simmering deep fried mushrooms( usually chopped mushroom) in a spicy broth, until it reaches a porridge like consistency and served sprinkled with chopped oinions and coriander leaves.

==Language==
[[Kongu Tamil]] is the dialect of [[Tamil language]] that is spoken majorly in the city. It is originally known as "Kangee"`&lt;ref&gt;
"In the southern part of Mysore the Tamil language is at this day named the Kangee, from being best known to them as the language of the people of Kangiam". Cf. Wilks: Mysore 1, 4n. 55.[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7c9AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=kangiam+mysore&amp;dq=kangiam+mysore&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fDWtTeXUIYu8vQP8oejTCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;  or "Kongalam"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KlYIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PT69&amp;dq=congoo+country&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5r2PUPPwMcTyrQfon4GICw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6wEwAA]&lt;/ref&gt; or "Kongappechu". The speciality of Kongu Tamil is the use of the [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] ற - Tra/Dra (as in the English word track) instead of [[retroflex]] T/D (ட) of standard Tamil. For example, 'ennuDaya' (mine) of standard Tamil is pronounced enRa in the Kongu dialect. Additionally the use of guttural nasal (ங்) that sounds "ng" as in the English word Gang, is more prevalent in Kongu Tamil, leading to situations where the grammar of Kongu Tamil would not fit into the grammar of standard Tamil (as laid down in authoritative treatises like [[Tolkappiyam]] and Nannool). One of the examples is the use of ங் to end a word like வாங் "vaang", means 'come' expressed in a respectful tone, which in standard Tamil would be "vaanga". [[English language|English]] is increasingly spoken by the educated class and other languages spoken in the city include [[Malayalam,Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Urdu]].

==Festivals==
Coimbatore celebrates many festivals including local temple festivals. [[Thai Pongal]], celebrated in the month of January, is the most important festival of and is celebrated over a period of five days. Pongal has been designated the "State Festival" for its unique celebration that is typical of Tamil Nadu. [[Tamil New Year]] signifying the beginning of the Tamil calendar usually falls in April and is celebrated widely with special poojas in temples. Being a cosmopolitan city, almost all major festivals like [[Deepavali]], [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid]] and [[Christmas]] are celebrated here. [[Onam]] is also celebrated with much fanfare due to the large [[Malayali]] immigrant population.

==Ethnic groups==
The vast majority of Dominicans are of African descent (75% at the 2014 census).&lt;ref name="2001 census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricomstats.org/Files/Publications/NCR%20Reports/Dominica.pdf|format=PDF|title=DOMINICA NATIONAL CENSUS REPORT 2000 ROUND OF POPULATION AND HOUSING CENSUS SUB-PROJECT|website=Caricomstats.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significant mixed population (19%)  at the 2014 census due to intermarriage, along with a small European origin minority (0.8%; descendants of French, British, and Irish colonists), East Indians (0.1%) groups, and there are small numbers of Lebanese/Syrians (0.1%) and Asians.

===[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]]===
[[Dominica]] is the only Eastern Caribbean island that still has a population of pre-Columbian native [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] (also known as [[Island Caribs|Kalinago]]), who were exterminated, driven from neighbouring islands, or mixed with Africans and/or Europeans. According to the 2001 census there are only 2,001 [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] remaining (2.9% of the total population). A considerable growth occurred since the 1991 census when 1,634 [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] were counted (2.4% of the total population). 
The [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] live in eight villages on the east coast of [[Dominica]]. This special [[Carib Territory]] was granted by the British Crown in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avirtualdominica.com/caribs.htm |title=The Carib Indians |publisher=Avirtualdominica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The present number of [[Island Caribs|Kalinago]] is estimated at 4% more than 3,000.

==Languages==
[[English language|English]] is the official language and universally understood; however, because of historic [[French language|French]] domination, [[Antillean Creole]], a French-lexified creole language, is also widely spoken.

==Religion==
{{main|Religion in Dominica}}
According to the 2001 census, 91.2% percent of the population of [[Dominica]] is considered [[Christianity|Christian]], 1.6% has a non-Christian religion and 6.1% has no religion or did not state a religion (1.1%).&lt;ref name="2001 census"/&gt;

Roughly two thirds of [[Christianity|Christians]] are [[Roman Catholics]] (61.4% of the total population), a reflection of early French influence on the island, and one third are [[Protestant]]. The [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] constitute the largest Protestant group, with 6.7% of the population. [[Seventh-day Adventists]] are the second largest group (6.1%). The next largest group are [[Pentecostals]] (5.6% of the population), followed by [[Baptists]] (4.1%).  Other [[Christianity|Christians]] include [[Methodists#Caribbean|Methodists]] (3.7%), Church of God (1.2%), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (1.2%), [[Anglicanism]] (0.6%) and [[Brethren Christian]] (0.3%).
During the past decades the number of [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Anglicans]] has decreased, while the number of other Protestants has increased, especially [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Pentecostals]] (5.6% of the population) and [[Baptists]]).&lt;ref name="2001 census"/&gt;

The number of non-Christians is small. These religious groups include the [[Rastafarian Movement]] (1.3% of the population), [[Hinduism in the West Indies|Hinduism]] (0.1%) and [[Muslims]] (0.2%).

[[Ethnic conflict]] exists in every country and [[Ghana]] is just one of them. Ghana ranks 43rd in the [[World Peace Index]].&lt;ref&gt;https://countryeconomy.com/demography/global-peace-index/ghana&lt;/ref&gt; and as the most peaceful country in [[West Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;https://yen.com.gh/95458-ghana-peaceful-country-west-africa.html#95458&lt;/ref&gt;. 

There have been conflicts such as the [[Konkomba-Nanumba conflict]],{{when|date=April 2018}} which was fought because of trade dispute.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.refworld.org/docid/3df4be33c.html&lt;/ref&gt; This war is widely known in Ghana and even other African countries. Of all the ethnic groups, the Ashanti were known for the numerous wars they fought when Ghana was called the [[Gold Coast (British Colony)]]. "From 1806 until 1896, the Ashanti Kingdom was in a perpetual state of war involving expansion or defense of its domain".&lt;!-- YOU CANNOT CITE WIKIPEDIA ON ITSELF --&gt; 

The [[Ashanti Empire]] were known for conquering many lands and claiming them.{{when|date=April 2018}} They conquered many lands because they possessed more power than other ethnic groups mainly because of their number and the vastness of their empire. They also fought with the British many times, but the most notable war being the [[Yaa Asantewaa]] war in which she led the Ashantis.

{{Indigenous Peoples of Canada}}

In [[Canada]], the '''First Nations''' ({{lang-fr|Premières Nations}}) are the predominant [[indigenous peoples in Canada]] south of the [[Arctic Circle]]. Those in the Arctic area are distinct and known as [[Inuit]]. The [[Métis in Canada|Métis]], another distinct ethnicity, developed after European contact and relations primarily between First Nations people and Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100014642/1100100014643 |title=Terminology |work=Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada |date=October 1, 2012 |accessdate=January 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114030734/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100014642/1100100014643 |archivedate=January 14, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 634&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afn.ca/description-of-the-afn |title=Description of the AFN |work=Assembly of First Nations |accessdate=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognized [[List of First Nations governments|First Nations governments or bands]] spread across [[Canada]], roughly half of which are in the provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afn.ca/article.asp?id=59 |title=Assembly of First Nations – The Story |work=The Assembly of First Nations |accessdate=October 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802164225/http://www.afn.ca/article.asp?id=59 |archivedate=August 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Employment equity (Canada)|Employment Equity Act]], First Nations are a "designated group", along with women, [[visible minorities]], and people with physical or mental disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chrc-ccdp.ca/eng/content/employment-equity |title=Employment Equity |work=Canadian Human Rights Commission |publisher=Government of Canada |date=September 1, 2013|accessdate=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; First Nations are not defined as a [[visible minority]] under the Act or by the criteria of [[Statistics Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/concepts/definitions/minority-minorite1-eng.htm |title=Visible minority of person |work=Definitions, data sources and methods |publisher=Statistics Canada, Government of Canada |date=December 18, 2012 |accessdate=January 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224021039/http://statcan.gc.ca/concepts/definitions/minority-minorite1-eng.htm |archivedate=December 24, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

North American indigenous peoples have cultures spanning thousands of years.  Some of their [[oral tradition]]s accurately describe historical events, such as the [[1700 Cascadia earthquake|Cascadia earthquake of 1700]] and the 18th-century [[Tseax Cone]] eruption. Written records began with the arrival of [[Exploration of North America|European explorers]] and [[European colonization of the Americas|colonists]] during the [[Age of Discovery]], beginning in the late 15th century.&lt;ref name="Woodcock"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[archeological]] and [[anthropological]] research, as well as [[linguistics]], have helped scholars piece together an understanding of ancient cultures and historic peoples.

Although not without conflict, [[Euro-Canadian]]s' early interactions with First Nations, Métis, and Inuit populations were less combative compared to the [[American Indian Wars|often violent battles]] between [[Colonial history of the United States|colonists]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|native peoples in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Preston|first=David L.|title=The Texture of Contact: European and Indian Settler Communities on the Frontiers of Iroquoia, 1667–1783|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-9N6-6UCnoC&amp;pg=PA43|year=2009|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|isbn=978-0-8032-2549-7|pages=43–44|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112102431/https://books.google.com/books?id=L-9N6-6UCnoC&amp;pg=PA43|archivedate=January 12, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some indigenous peoples in Canada have also adopted the term ''First Nation'' to replace the word ''band ''in the formal name of their community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100014642 Terminology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813194248/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100014642 |date=August 13, 2012 }}.

The term Indian is a misnomer given to indigenous peoples of North America by European explorers who erroneously thought they had landed on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The use of the term [[Native Americans in the United States|''Native Americans'']], which the US government and others have adopted, is not common in Canada. It refers more specifically to the Indigenous peoples residing within the boundaries of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill |first=Liz |url=http://www.americanindian.si.edu/subpage.cfm?subpage=shop&amp;second=books&amp;third=DoAllIndiansLiveInTipis |title=National Museum of the American Indian |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |year=2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703022007/http://americanindian.si.edu/subpage.cfm?subpage=shop&amp;second=books&amp;third=DoAllIndiansLiveInTipis |archivedate=July 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The parallel term ''Native Canadian'' is not commonly used, but ''Native'' (in English) and {{lang|fr|autochtone}} (in [[Canadian French]]; from the Greek {{transl|el|auto}}, own, and {{transl|el|chthon}}, land) are.

Within Canada, ''First Nations'' has come into general use for [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] other than [[Inuit]] and [[Métis]].  Individuals using the term outside Canada include [[Tribe (Native American)|U.S. tribes]] within the [[Pacific Northwest]], as well as supporters of the [[Cascadia (independence movement)|Cascadian independence movement]]. The singular, commonly used on culturally politicized [[Indian reserve|reserves]], is the term ''First Nations person'' (when gender-specific, ''First Nations man'' or ''First Nations woman''). A more recent trend is for members of various nations to refer to themselves by their [[Indian tribe|tribal]] or [[Nationality|national]] identity only, e.g., "I'm [[Haida people|Haida]]", or "We're [[Kwantlen First Nation|Kwantlens]]", in recognition of the distinctive First Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The first European explorers and settlers of what is now Canada relied on the First Nations peoples, for resources and trade to sustain a living. The first written accounts of interaction show a predominantly Old world bias, labelling the indigenous peoples as "savages," although the indigenous peoples were organized and self-sufficient. In the early days of contact, the First Nations and Inuit populations welcomed the Europeans, assisting them in living off the land and joining forces with the French and British in their various battles. It was not until the colonial and imperial forces of Britain and France established dominant settlements and, no longer needing the help of the First Nations people, began to break treaties and force them off the land that the antagonism between the two groups grew.

The [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese Crown]] claimed it had territorial rights in the area visited by Cabot. In 1493 [[Pope Alexander VI]] – assuming international jurisdiction – had divided lands discovered in America between Spain and Portugal. The next year, in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], these two kingdoms decided to draw the dividing line running north–south, 370 [[League (unit)|leagues]] (from {{convert|1500|to|2200|km|abbr=on}} approximately depending on the league used) west of the [[Cape Verde]] Islands. Land to the west would be Spanish, to the east Portuguese. Given the uncertain geography of the day, this seemed to give the "new founde isle" to Portugal. On the 1502 [[Cantino planisphere|Cantino map]], Newfoundland appears on the Portuguese side of the line (as does [[Brazil]]). An expedition captured about 60 Aboriginal people as slaves who were said to "resemble [[Romani people|gypsies]] in colour, features, stature and aspect; are clothed in the skins of various animals ...They are very shy and gentle, but well formed in arms and legs and shoulders beyond description ...." Some captives, sent by [[Gaspar Corte-Real]], reached Portugal. The others drowned, with Gaspar, on the return voyage. Gaspar's brother, [[Miguel Corte-Real]], went to look for him in 1502, but also failed to return. Scholars believe{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} that Miguel Corte-Real carved inscriptions on the controversial [[Dighton Rock]].

[[Samuel de Champlain]], his geographer, promptly carried out a major exploration of the northeastern coastline of what is now the United States.

Allied with the French, the first nations of the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] of [[Acadia]] fought six colonial wars against the British and their native allies (See the [[French and Indian Wars]], [[Father Rale's War]] and [[Father Le Loutre's War]]).&lt;ref&gt;In [[British America]] nomenclature, the sitting British monarch became the war's namesake, such as [[King William's War]] or [[Queen Anne's War]]. Because there had already been a [[King George's War]] in the 1740s, British colonists named the second war in [[George II of Great Britain|King George II's]] reign after their opponents, so it became the ''French and Indian War''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second war, [[Queen Anne's War]], the British conquered [[Acadia]] (1710). The sixth and final [[French and Indian War|colonial war]] between the nations of [[Ancien Régime in France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] (1754–1763), resulted in the French giving up their claims and the British claimed the lands of [[Canada (New France)|Canada]].

In this final war, the [[Franco-Indian alliance]] brought together Americans, First Nations and the French, centred on the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Illinois Country]].&lt;ref name="volo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Volo |first1=James M. |last2=Volo |first2=Dorothy Denneen |title=Family Life in Native America |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-9Nfy4ztuPwC&amp;pg=PA316 |accessdate=August 31, 2009 |date=September 30, 2007 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |isbn= 978-0-313-33795-6 |page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance involved French settlers on the one side, and on the other side were the Abenaki, Odawa, [[Menominee]], [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago), [[Mississaugas]], [[Illinois Confederation|Illiniwek]], Huron-[[Petun]], [[Potawatomi]] etc.&lt;ref name="volo" /&gt; It allowed the French and the Indians to form a haven in the middle-[[Ohio River|Ohio valley]] before the open conflict between the European powers erupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calloway |first1=Colin G. |title=The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities (Studies in North American Indian History) |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5YWahCbKiUoC&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q= |accessdate=August 31, 2009 |date=April 28, 1995 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-47569-3 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], the British recognized the treaty rights of the indigenous populations and resolved to only settle those areas purchased lawfully from the indigenous peoples. Treaties and land purchases were made in several cases by the British, but the lands of several indigenous nations remain unceded and/or unresolved.

====Slavery====
{{Main|Slavery in Canada}}

First Nations routinely captured slaves from neighbouring tribes. Sources report that the conditions under which First Nations slaves lived could be brutal, with the [[Makah]] tribe practicing death by [[starvation]] as punishment and Pacific coast tribes routinely performing ritualized killings of slaves as part of social ceremonies into the mid-1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, Leland (1997).

====1775–1815====
[[File:Fur traders in canada 1777.jpg|thumb|Fur traders in Canada, trading with First Nations, 1777]]

British agents worked to make the First Nations into military allies of the British, providing supplies, weapons, and encouragement.  During the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783) most of the tribes supported the British.  In 1779, the Americans [[Sullivan Expedition|launched a campaign]] to burn the villages of the Iroquois in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;
Max M. Mintz, ''Seeds of Empire: The American Revolutionary Conquest of the Iroquois'' (New York University Press, 1999).
&lt;/ref&gt; The refugees fled to Fort Niagara and other British posts, and remained permanently in Canada.  Although the British ceded the Old Northwest to the United States in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, it kept fortifications and trading posts in the region until 1795. The British then evacuated American territory, but operated trading posts in British territory, providing weapons and encouragement to tribes that were resisting American expansion into such areas as Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert S. Allen, ''His Majesty's Indian allies: British Indian policy in the defence of Canada, 1774–1815'' (Toronto: Dundurn Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  Officially, the British agents discouraged any warlike activities or raids on American settlements, but the Americans became increasingly angered, and this became one of the [[Origins of the War of 1812|causes of the War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;
David S. Heidler, and Jeanne T., Heidler, eds., ''Encyclopedia of the War of 1812'' (1997) pp=253, 392&lt;/ref&gt;

In the war, the great majority of First Nations supported the British, and many fought under the aegis of [[Tecumseh]].&lt;ref&gt;
Herbert C. W. Goltz, "Tecumseh". in John English, ed., ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online: V (1801–1820)'' (2000) [http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=36806&amp;query=tecumseh online]
&lt;/ref&gt;  But Tecumseh died in battle in 1813 and the Indian coalition collapsed.  The British had long wished to create a neutral Indian state in the American Old Northwest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Dwight L. |  year = 1989 | title = A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea | url = | journal = Northwest Ohio Quarterly | volume = 61 | issue = 2–4| pages = 46–63 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and made this demand as late as 1814 at the peace negotiations at Ghent.  The Americans rejected the idea, the British dropped it, and Britain's Indian allies lost British support. In addition, the Indians were no longer able to gather furs in American territory.  Abandoned by their powerful sponsor, Great Lakes-area natives ultimately assimilated into American society, migrated to the west or to Canada, or were relocated onto reservations in Michigan and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;
Colin G. Calloway, "The End of an Era: British-Indian Relations in the Great Lakes Region after the War of 1812," ''Michigan Historical Review'' 1986 12(2): 1–20. 0890–1686

Living conditions for Indigenous people in the [[Canadian Prairies|prairie]] regions deteriorated quickly. Between 1875 and 1885, settlers and hunters of European descent contributed to hunting the North American bison almost to extinction; the construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] brought large numbers of European settlers west who encroached on Indigenous territory. European Canadians established governments, police forces, and [[Court|courts of law]] with different foundations from indigenous practices. Various epidemics continued to devastate Indigenous communities. All of these factors had a profound effect on Indigenous people, particularly those from the plains who had relied heavily on bison for food and clothing. Most of those nations that agreed to treaties had negotiated for a guarantee of food and help to begin farming.&lt;ref name = "finkelconrad"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Finkel | first1 = Alvin | last2=Conrad|first2=Margaret Conrad | title = History of the Canadian Peoples, 1867–present | publisher = Pearson Education Canada|edition=4 | date = August 25, 2005|volume=2 | isbn =978-0321270092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the bison disappeared (the last Canadian hunt was in 1879), [[Lieutenant Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]] [[Edgar Dewdney]] cut rations to indigenous people in an attempt to reduce government costs.

====Colonization and integration====

[[File:Stpauls-middlechurch-man.jpg|thumb|upright|St. Paul's Indian Industrial School, Manitoba, 1901]]
The history of colonization is complex, varied according to the time and place. France and Britain were the main colonial powers involved, though the United States also began to extend its territory at the expense of indigenous people as well.

From the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged First Nations to [[Cultural imperialism|assimilate]] into the European-based culture, referred to as "[[Canadian culture]]". The assumption was that this was the "correct" culture because the Canadians of European descent saw themselves as dominant, and technologically, politically and culturally superior.&lt;ref name="RoyalCom-sg3"&gt;{{Cite journal

Funded under the [[Indian Act]] by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, a branch of the federal government, the schools were run by churches of various denominations – about 60% by Roman Catholics, and 30% by the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] and the [[United Church of Canada]], along with its pre-1925 predecessors, [[Presbyterian Church in Canada|Presbyterian]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] and [[Methodism|Methodist]] churches.

The attempt to [[Forced assimilation|force assimilation]] involved punishing children for speaking their own languages or practicing their own faiths, leading to allegations in the 20th century of [[cultural genocide]] and [[ethnocide]]. There was widespread physical and [[sexual abuse]]. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of [[tuberculosis]], and death rates of up to 69%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Curry | first1 = Bill | last2 = Howlett | first2 = Karen | title = Natives died in droves as Ottawa ignored warnings Tuberculosis took the lives of students at residential schools for at least 40 years | work = [[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]] | date = April 24, 2007 | url = http://www.heyokamagazine.com/HEYOKA.8.GlobeAndMail.1.htm | format = Digitised online by Heyoka Magazine | accessdate = October 9, 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090413064440/http://www.heyokamagazine.com/HEYOKA.8.GlobeAndMail.1.htm | archivedate = April 13, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Details of the mistreatment of students had been published numerous times throughout the 20th century, but following the closure of the schools in the 1960s, the work of indigenous activists and historians led to a change in the public perception of the residential school system, as well as official government apologies, and a (controversial) legal settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1995/Carney.pdf|title=Robert CARNEY, Aboriginal Residential Schools Before Confederation: The Early Experience |publisher= CCHA, Historical Studies, 61|year=1995 |volume=13–40 |accessdate=October 13, 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonization had a significant impact on First Nations diet and health. According to the historian Mary-Ellen Kelm, "inadequate reserve allocations, restrictions on the food fishery, overhunting, and over-trapping" alienated First Nations from their traditional way of life, which undermined their physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health.&lt;ref&gt;Kelm, Mary-Ellen (1998).

Four years later, in May 1943, the government declared that, as [[British subject]]s, all able Indian men of military age could be called up for training and service in Canada or overseas.

===Late 20th century===
Following the end of the Second World War, laws concerning First Nations in Canada began to change, albeit slowly. The federal prohibition of potlatch and Sun Dance ceremonies ended in 1951. Provincial governments began to accept the right of Indigenous people to vote. In June 1956, section 9 of the [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Citizenship Act]] was amended to grant formal citizenship to Status Indians and Inuit, retroactively as of January 1947.

In 1960, First Nations people received the right to vote in federal elections without forfeiting their Indian status. By comparison, Native Americans in the United States had been allowed to vote since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====1969 White Paper====

In his [[1969 White Paper]], then-[[Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (Canada)|Minister of Indian Affairs]], [[Jean Chrétien]], proposed the abolition of the Indian Act of Canada, the rejection of [[Aboriginal land claim]]s, and the assimilation of First Nations people into the Canadian population with the status of "other ethnic minorities" rather than as a distinct group.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afn.ca/misc/AFN-AGA-2009.pdf |title=Assembly of First Nations Annual Report |work=AFN Executive Committee Reports |publisher=Assembly of First Nations |date=2008–2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=October 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091102145955/http://www.afn.ca/misc/AFN-AGA-2009.pdf |archivedate=November 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold Cardinal]] and the Indian Chiefs of Alberta responded with a document entitled "Citizens Plus" but commonly known as the "Red Paper". In it, they explained Status Indians' widespread opposition to Chrétien's proposal. [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] and the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] began to back away from the 1969 White Paper, particularly after the [[Calder v. British Columbia (Attorney General)|Calder case]] decision in 1973.&lt;ref name="ndp-ear"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tester |first1=Frank James |last2=McNicoll|first2=Paule McNicoll |author3=Jessie Forsyth |title=With an ear to the ground: The CCF/NDP and Aboriginal policy in Canada, 1926–1993 |work=Journal of Canadian Studies |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc |date=Spring 1999|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3683/is_199904/ai_n8843392/pg_9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706013520/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3683/is_199904/ai_n8843392/pg_9 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-07-06 |accessdate=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Canadian Supreme Court recognized that indigenous rights and treaty rights were not extinguished, a process was begun to resolve land claims and treaty rights and is ongoing today.

====Health transfer policy====
{{Main|Indian Health Transfer Policy (Canada)}}
In 1970, severe [[mercury poisoning]], called [[Ontario Minamata disease]], was discovered among [[Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation]] and [[Wabaseemoong Independent Nations]] people, who lived near [[Dryden, Ontario]].

&lt;/ref&gt; This led to legislation and eventually the [[Indian Health Transfer Policy (Canada)|Indian Health Transfer Policy]] that provided a framework for the assumption of control of health services by First Nations people, and set forth a developmental approach to transfer centred on the concept of self-determination in health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/alt_formats/fnihb-dgspni/pdf/pubs/agree-accord/1999_finance_integr-eng.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130111060520/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/alt_formats/fnihb-dgspni/pdf/pubs/agree-accord/1999_finance_integr-eng.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 11, 2013 |title=Financing a First Nations and Inuit Integrated Health System |work=Health Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=October 9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this process, the decision to enter into transfer discussions with [[Health Canada]] rests with each community.

The capacity, experience and relationships developed by First Nations as a result of health transfer was a factor that assisted the creation of the [[First Nations Health Authority]] in British Columbia.

====Elijah Harper and the Meech Lake Accord====
{{Main|Meech Lake Accord}}
In 1981, [[Elijah Harper]], a Cree from [[Red Sucker Lake First Nation|Red Sucker Lake]], [[Manitoba]], became the first "Treaty Indian" in Manitoba to be elected as a [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|member]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of Manitoba]]. In 1990, Harper achieved national fame by holding an eagle feather as he refused to accept the [[Meech Lake Accord]], a [[constitutional amendment]] package negotiated to gain Quebec's acceptance of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], but also one that did not address any First Nations grievances. The accord was negotiated in 1987 without the input of Canada's [[Indigenous peoples|Aboriginal peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The third, final constitutional conference on Aboriginal peoples was also unsuccessful. The Manitoba assembly was required to unanimously consent to a motion allowing it to hold a vote on the accord, because of a procedural rule. Twelve days before the ratification deadline for the Accord, Harper began a [[filibuster]] that prevented the assembly from ratifying the accord. Because Meech Lake failed in Manitoba, the proposed constitutional amendment failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

====Women's status and Bill C-31====
{{Main|Indian Act}}
According to the Indian Act, [[status Indian]] women who married men who were not status Indians lost their [[Indian Register|treaty status]], and their children would not get status. However, in the reverse situation, if a status Indian man married a woman who was not a status Indian, the man would keep his status and his children would also receive treaty status. In the 1970s, the Indian Rights for Indian Women and [[Native Women's Association of Canada]] groups campaigned against this policy because it discriminated against women and failed to fulfill treaty promises.&lt;ref name = "finkelconrad"/&gt; They successfully convinced the federal government to change the section of the act with the adoption of Bill C-31 on June 28, 1985. Women who had lost their status and children who had been excluded were then able to register and gain official Indian status. Despite these changes, status Indian women who married men who were not status Indians could pass their status on only one generation: their children would gain status, but (without a marriage to a full-status Indian) their grandchildren would not. A status Indian man who married a woman who was not a status Indian retained status as did his children, but his wife did not gain status, nor did his grandchildren.

Bill C-31 also gave elected bands the power to regulate who was allowed to reside on their reserves and to control development on their reserves. It abolished the concept of "[[Gradual Civilization Act|enfranchisement]]" by which First Nations people could gain certain rights by renouncing their Indian status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Erasmus–Dussault commission====
{{Main|Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples}}
In 1991, Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] created the [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]] chaired by René Dussault and [[Georges Erasmus]]. Their 1996 report proposed the creation of a government for (and by) the First Nations that would be responsible within its own jurisdiction, and with which the federal government would speak on a "Nation-to-Nation" basis.&lt;ref name=" Royal" /&gt; This proposal offered a far different way of doing politics than the traditional policy of assigning First Nations matters under the jurisdiction of the Indian and Northern Affairs, managed by one minister of the federal cabinet. The report also recommended providing the governments of the First Nations with up to [[Canadian dollar|$]]2 billion every year until 2010, in order to reduce the economic gap between the First Nations and the rest of the Canadian citizenry.&lt;ref name=" Royal" /&gt; The money would represent an increase of at least 50% to the budget of Indian and Northern Affairs.&lt;ref name=" Royal" /&gt; The report engaged First Nations leaders to think of ways to cope with the challenging issues their people were facing, so the First Nations could take their destiny into their own hands.&lt;ref name=" Royal"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dussault |first1=René |last2=Erasmus|first2=George |title=The High Arctic Relocation: A Report on the 1953–55 Relocation |work=Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples |publisher=Canadian Government Publishing |year=1994 |url=http://www.fedpubs.com/subject/aborig/arctic_reloc.htm |accessdate=October 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001232453/http://www.fedpubs.com/subject/aborig/arctic_reloc.htm |archivedate=October 1, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government, then headed by Jean Chrétien, responded to the report a year later by officially presenting its apologies for the forced acculturation the federal government had imposed on the First Nations, and by offering an "initial" provision of $350 million.&lt;ref name=" Royal" /&gt;

In the spirit of the Eramus–Dussault commission, tripartite (federal, provincial, and First Nations) accords have been signed since the report was issued. Several political crises between different provincial governments and different bands of the First Nations also occurred in the late 20th century, notably the [[Oka Crisis]], [[Ipperwash Crisis]], [[Burnt Church Crisis]], and the [[Gustafsen Lake standoff]].&lt;ref name=" Royal" /&gt;

===Early 21st century===
{{See also|Grand River land dispute|Kelowna Accord}}
In 2001, the [[Quebec government]], the federal government, and the Cree Nation signed "[[Agreement Respecting a New Relationship Between the Cree Nation and the Government of Quebec|La Paix des Braves]]" (''The Peace of the Braves'', a reference to the 1701 peace treaty between the French and the Iroquois League). The agreement allowed [[Hydro-Québec]] to exploit the province's [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] resources in exchange for an allocation of $3.5 billion to be given to the government of the Cree Nation. Later, the Inuit of [[Nord-du-Québec|northern Quebec]] ([[Nunavik]]) joined in the agreement.
[[File:The Defense of Cree Rights.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The defence of Cree rights]]

In 2005, the leaders of the First Nations, various provincial governments, and the federal government produced an agreement called the [[Kelowna Accord]], which would have yielded $5 billion over 10 years, but the new federal government of [[Stephen Harper]] (2006) did not follow through on the working paper.
First Nations, along with the Métis and the Inuit, have claimed to receive inadequate funding for education, and allege their rights have been overlooked. [[James Bartleman]], [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario]], listed the encouragement of indigenous young people as one of his key priorities. During his term that began in 2002, he launched initiatives to promote literacy and bridge building. Bartleman himself is the first Aboriginal person to hold the lieutenant governor's position in Ontario.

As of 2006, 76 First Nations communities exist in [[boil-water advisory]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Water still a problem on 76 reserves |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/02/20/aboriginal-water060220.html |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=February 20, 2006 |accessdate=July 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813005820/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/02/20/aboriginal-water060220.html |archivedate=August 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In late 2005, the [[Water crisis|drinking water crisis]] of the [[Kashechewan First Nation]] received national [[media of Canada|media]] attention when ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' was discovered in their [[Water supply network|water supply system]], following two years of living under a boil-water advisory. The [[drinking water]] was supplied by a new [[Water treatment|treatment plant]] built in March 1998. The cause of the tainted water was a plugged chlorine injector that was not discovered by local operators, who were not qualified to be running the treatment plant. When officials arrived and fixed the problem, [[chlorine]] levels were around 1.7&amp;nbsp;[[Gram per litre|mg/l]], which was blamed for [[Skin disease|skin disorders]] such as [[impetigo]] and [[scabies]]. An investigation led by [[Health Canada]] revealed that the skin disorders were likely due to living in squalor. The evacuation of Kashechewan was largely viewed by Canadians as a cry for help for other underlying social and economic issues which Aboriginal people in Canada face.

On June 29, 2007, Canadian Aboriginal groups held countrywide protests aimed at ending First Nations poverty, dubbed the [[Aboriginal Day of Action]]. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, although groups disrupted transportation with blockades or bonfires; a stretch of the [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] was shut down, as was the [[Canadian National Railway]]'s line between [[Toronto]] and Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The [[Idle No More]] [[Social movement|protest movement]] originated among the Aboriginals in  Canada  and their non-Aboriginal supporters in Canada, and to a lesser extent, internationally.  It consisted of a number of political actions worldwide, inspired in part by the [[hunger strike]] of [[Attawapiskat]] Chief [[Theresa Spence]]&lt;ref name=Raveena&gt;{{cite news|last=Aulakh|first=Raveena|title=Chief Theresa Spence’s hunger strike has full backing of Attawapiskat residents|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1306869--chief-theresa-spence-s-hunger-strike-has-full-backing-of-attawapiskat-residents|publisher=theStar.com|accessdate=December 27, 2012|location=Toronto|date=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further coordinated via [[social media]]. A reaction to alleged abuses of indigenous [[treaty rights]] by the current federal government, the movement takes particular issue with the recent [[omnibus bill]] Bill C-45.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;DocId=5942521&amp;File=4 Bill C-45] is part of the [[41st Canadian Parliament#Omnibus bills|41st Canadian Parliament Omnibus bills]] and is a "second Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 29, 2012, and other measures."

==Canadian Crown and First Nations relations==
{{Main|The Canadian Crown and Indigenous peoples of Canada}}
[[File:David Laird explaining Treaty 8 Fort Vermilion 1899 - NA-949-34.jpg|thumb|upright|Honourable [[David Laird]] explaining&lt;br /&gt; terms of Treaty #8, Fort Vermilion, 1899]]
The relationship between the Canadian Crown and the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples of Canada stretches back to the [[Timeline of colonization of North America|first interactions]] between European colonialists and North American indigenous people. Over centuries of interaction, [[Treaty|treaties]] were established, and Canada's First Nations have, like the [[Māori people|Māori]] and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in [[New Zealand]], come to generally view these agreements as being between them and the Crown of Canada, and not the ever-changing governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~nativest/pim/waitangi.htm|title=A Historical Analysis of Early Nation to Nation Relations in Canada and New Zealand:The Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Treaty of Niagara and The Treaty of Waitangi|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}{{Full citation needed|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/220171|last=Mainville|first= Sara|work=Toronto Star|title=Lawsuits, treaty rights and the sacred balance|date= June 1, 2007|accessdate=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The associations exist between the Aboriginal peoples of Canada and the reigning [[Title and style of the Canadian monarch|monarch of Canada]]; as was stated in the proposed First Nations{{spaced ndash}}Federal Crown Political Accord: "cooperation will be a cornerstone for partnership between Canada and First Nations, wherein Canada is the short-form reference to Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada".&lt;ref name=FN /&gt; These relations are governed by the established treaties; the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] stated that treaties "served to reconcile pre-existing Aboriginal sovereignty with assumed Crown sovereignty, and to define Aboriginal rights,"&lt;ref name=FN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afn.ca/cmslib/general/PolAcc.pdf |title=A First Nations – Federal Crown Political Accord on the Recognition and Implementation of First Nation Governments |publisher=Assembly of First Nations and Government of Canada |format=PDF |accessdate=October 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816041503/http://www.afn.ca/cmslib/general/PolAcc.pdf |archivedate=August 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the First Nations saw these agreements as meant to last "as long as the sun shines, grass grows and rivers flow".

===Taxation===
Although taxes are not specifically addressed in the written terms of any treaties, assurances regarding taxation were clearly offered when at least some treaties were negotiated.&lt;ref&gt;See Richard H. Bartlett, Indians and Taxation in Canada, 3d ed.(Saskatoon: Native Law Centre, 1992) at 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The various statutory exemptions from taxation are established under the current [[Indian Act]], which reads:

{{quote|{{unbulleted list

===Political organization===
{{Main|First Nations government (Canada)|List of First Nations governments}}
Self-government has given chiefs and their councils powers which combine those of a province, school board, health board and municipality. Councils are also largely self-regulating regarding utilities, environmental protection, natural resources, building codes, etc.  There is concern that this wide-ranging authority, [[Separation of powers|concentrated in a single council]], might be a cause of the dysfunctional governments experienced by many First Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Ovide Mercredi.JPG|thumb|upright|alt="Ovide Mercredi speaking to the media"|[[Ovide Mercredi]], former national chief of the [[Assembly of First Nations]]]]

[[Assembly of First Nations|The Assembly of First Nations (AFN)]] is a body of First Nations leaders in Canada. The aims of the organization are to protect the rights, treaty obligations, ceremonies, and claims of citizens of the First Nations in Canada.

After the failures of the League of Indians in Canada in the [[Interwar period]] and the North American Indian Brotherhood in two decades following the Second World War, the Aboriginal peoples of Canada organised themselves once again in the early 1960s. The National Indian Council was created in 1961 to represent Indigenous people, including Treaty/Status Indians, non-status people, the Métis people, though not the Inuit.&lt;ref name="afnstory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Assembly of First Nations – The Story |url=http://www.afn.ca/article.asp?id=59 |accessdate=October 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802164225/http://www.afn.ca/article.asp?id=59 |archivedate=August 2, 2009 }}
[]&lt;/ref&gt; This organization also collapsed in 1968 as the three groups failed to act as one, so the non-status and Métis groups formed the Native Council of Canada and Treaty/Status groups formed the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB), an [[Umbrella organization|umbrella group]] for provincial and territorial First Nations organizations.

===Languages===
:''Main articles: [[Spoken languages of Canada#Aboriginal languages|First Nations Aboriginal languages]]''
[[File:Langs N.Amer.png|thumb|upright|Language families in Northern America at the time of European contact]]
Today, there are over thirty different languages spoken by indigenous people, most of which are spoken only in Canada. Many are in decline. Those with the most speakers include [[Anishinaabe language|Anishinaabe]] and [[Cree language|Cree]] (together totalling up to 150,000 speakers); [[Inuktitut]] with about 29,000 speakers in the [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], Nunavik (Northern Quebec), and [[Nunatsiavut]] (Northern Labrador); and [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]], with around 8,500 speakers, mostly in Eastern Canada. Many Aboriginal peoples have lost their native languages and often all but surviving elders speak English or French as their first language.&lt;ref name="online"&gt;{{Cite book

Two of Canada's territories give official status to native languages.

In the Northwest Territories, the ''Official Languages Act''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/PDF/ACTS/Official_Languages.pdf |title=Official Languages Act |format=PDF |publisher=Government of Canada |work=Justice Canada |accessdate=October 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324214716/http://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/PDF/ACTS/Official_Languages.pdf |archivedate=March 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; declares that there are eleven different languages: [[Dene Suline language|Chipewyan]], [[Cree language|Cree]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Gwich’in language|Gwich’in]], [[Inuinnaqtun]], [[Inuktitut]], [[Inuvialuktun]], North [[Slavey language|Slavey]], South Slavey and [[Dogrib language|Tłįchǫ]]. Besides English and French, these languages are not vehicular in government; official status entitles citizens to receive services in them on request and to deal with the government in them.&lt;ref name="online"/&gt;

===Art===
{{Main|Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
[[File:Totem haida.jpg|thumb|right|[[Haida people|Haida]] totem pole, Thunderbird Park, Victoria, British Columbia]]
First Nations were producing art for thousands of years before the arrival of European [[Settler colonialism|settler colonists]] and the eventual establishment of Canada as a [[nation state]]. Like the peoples who produced them, indigenous art traditions spanned territories across North America. Indigenous art traditions are organized by art historians according to cultural, linguistic or regional groups: Northwest Coast, [[Plateau First Nations|Plateau]], [[Plains Indians|Plains]], [[Eastern Woodlands tribes|Eastern Woodlands]], Subarctic, and Arctic.&lt;ref name="art" /&gt;

Art traditions vary enormously amongst and within these diverse groups. Indigenous art with a focus on portability and the body is distinguished from European traditions and its focus on architecture.  Indigenous visual art may be used in conjunction with other arts.  [[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|Shaman]]s' [[Masks among Eskimo peoples|masks]] and rattles are used ceremoniously in dance, storytelling and music.&lt;ref name="art" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Hessel|first1=Ingo|last2=Hessel|first2=Dieter|title=Inuit Art|trans-title=An introduction. foreword by George Swinton|year=1998|publisher=[[British Museum]] Press|location=London, UK|isbn=0-7141-2545-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the 1950s and 1960s that indigenous artists such as [[Mungo Martin]], [[Bill Reid]] and [[Norval Morrisseau]] began to publicly renew and re-invent indigenous art traditions. Currently there are indigenous artists practising in all media in Canada and two indigenous artists, [[Edward Poitras]] and [[Rebecca Belmore]], have represented Canada at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1995 and 2005 respectively.&lt;ref name="art" /&gt;

The First Nations peoples of Canada comprise diverse ethnic groups, each with their own musical traditions. There are general similarities in the music, but is usually social (public) or ceremonial (private). Public, social music may be [[dance music]] accompanied by [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]] and [[drum]]s. Private, ceremonial music includes vocal songs with accompaniment on [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], used to mark occasions like Midewiwin ceremonies and Sun Dances.

Traditionally, Aboriginal peoples used the materials at hand to make their instruments for centuries before Europeans immigrated to Canada.&lt;ref name="second"&gt;{{Cite book

Since the 1980s, the number of First Nations babies more than doubled and currently almost half of the First Nations population is under the age of 25. As a result, the First Nations population of Canada is expected to increase in the coming decades.&lt;ref name="statcan_aboriginal_demographics" /&gt;

The 2006 census counted a total Aboriginal population of 1,172,790 (3.75%) which includes 698,025 North American Indians (2.23%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=1&amp;IPS=&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=1&amp;PID=89122&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=No&amp;StartRow=1&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=73&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=&amp;GID=837928|title=Aboriginal Identity (8), Sex (3) and Age Groups (12) for the Population of Canada, Provinces, Territories, Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, 2006 Census – 20% |work=Statistics Canada Census: 2006 Census: Data products  Topic-based tabulations |publisher=Government of Canada|date=June 12, 2008|accessdate=October 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are distinct First Nations in Canada, originating across the country. [[Indian reserve]]s, established in [[Law of Canada|Canadian law]] by treaties such as [[Treaty 7]], are the very limited contemporary lands of First Nations recognized by the non-indigenous governments. A few reserves exist [[Urban Indian reserve|within cities]], such as the Opawikoscikan Reserve in [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]], [[Wendake, Quebec|Wendake]] in Quebec City or [[Stony Plain 135, Alberta|Stony Plain 135]] in the [[Edmonton Capital Region]]. There are more [[List of Indian reserves in Canada|reserves in Canada]] than there are First Nations, as First Nations were ceded multiple reserves by treaty.

See the individual article on each [[tribe]], [[band society]] or [[First Nations government (Canada)|First Nation]].

The Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast communities centred around ocean and river fishing; in the [[British Columbia Interior|interior of British Columbia]], hunting and gathering and river fishing. In both of these areas, salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, [[bison]] hunting was the primary activity. In the [[taiga|subarctic forest]], other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River, [[shifting agriculture]] was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

Today, Aboriginal people work in a variety of occupations and live outside their ancestral homes. The traditional cultures of their ancestors, shaped by nature, still exert a strong influence on their culture, from spirituality to political attitudes.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

=== Residential schools ===
{{Further|Canadian Indian residential school system|List of Indian residential schools in Canada}}
Canada's federal residential school system began in the mid-1870s, building upon a patchwork of boarding schools established and operated by various Christian denominations.  Member of Parliament for Assiniboia West, Nicholas Flood Davin, produced a report, known generally as the Davin Report, that recommended the establishment of a school system similar to that being created in the United States.  One of its chief goals was to remove Aboriginal children from "the influence of the wigwam", which he claimed was stronger than that of existing day schools, and keep them instead "constantly within the circle of civilized conditions".  While the history of the [[Canadian Indian residential school system|Indian Residential School system]] (IRS) is a checkered one, much criticism has been levelled at both the system and those who established and supported it. Neglect and poor nutrition were often what Aboriginal children experienced, particularly in the early decades of the system's operation.  The stripping away of traditional native culture—sometimes referred to as "cultural genocide"—is another charge levelled at the residential schools. In many schools, students were not allowed to speak their Indigenous languages or practice any of their own customs, and thus lost their sense of identity, inevitably driving a cultural wedge between children and their family.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By 1920, attendance at some sort of school was mandatory for Aboriginal children in Canada. The Indian Act made education compulsory, and where there were no federal days schools—or, in later decades, a provincial public school—a residential school was the only choice.  Enrolment statistics indicate that between 20% and 30% of Aboriginal children during the history of the IRS system attended a residential school for at least a year, and many were enrolled for ten years or more. In some cases, children could return home on weekends and holidays, but for those in schools established far away from remote communities, this was not possible.

The removal of children from their families and communities brought short and long term harm to many native communities. While many schools had infirmaries and provided medical care in later decades, abuse of various kinds and crowded conditions in the first decades of the IRS history led to poor health and even death for a percentage of those enrolled. It has been argued that the psychological and emotional trauma resulting from both the abuse and the removal of the children from their families and culture has resulted in substance abuse, greater domestic violence, unemployability, and increased rates of suicide.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/government-policy/the-residential-school-system.html|title = The Residential School System|date = 2009|accessdate = December 14, 2014|website = Indigenous Foundations|publisher = University of British Columbia|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160627221843/http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/government-policy/the-residential-school-system.html|archivedate = June 27, 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, children leaving residential schools found themselves at an intersection of cultures, where they were no longer comfortable within their own cultures, yet not accepted into mainstream Canadian culture. Former students are now routinely referred to as "survivors".

Not all Aboriginal children attended residential schools.  During the period in which the schools operated,  more than a third of indigenous children attended federal day schools, and about a third received no schooling at all. It is however the residential school system that receives much of the blame for the various problems and challenges facing Canada's indigenous people today. During the years in which the residential schools operated, they were regarded by most Canadians as a sensible and beneficial solution to native education, and in some cases, Aboriginal communities specifically requested that a residential school be built. When the system began to closing down in the 1960s, a significant number of communities asked that their school remain open.

The last Canadian residential school to close was [[Gordon Indian Residential School]] in Saskatchewan, founded in 1889, and closed in 1996.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Christian denominations that operated the schools on behalf of the federal government have expressed regret and issued apologies for their part in a system that harmed many indigenous children.  In 2008, the government issued an official apology to the students who were forced to attend the residential schools and their families.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In June 2015, the federally-established Truth and Reconciliation Commission, charged with investigating and reporting on the residential school system, issued its summary report, and in December of the same year, its final report.  Chief Commissioner, Judge Murray Sinclair, has publicly declared the residential school system a deliberate act of cultural genocide against First Nations peoples.  In its report, the commission submitted 94 recommendations to the Canadian government, recommendations which, if implemented, would substantially improve indigenous race relations, increase quality of life for survivors and extended families, and help undo the damage caused by residential schools. While the Liberal government, under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has committed itself to improving the lives of Canada's indigenous people, and specifically to implementing the TRC recommendations, some of those recommendations may be beyond the power of the Canadian government. The countless research documents assembled by the TRC will be archived in a special repository at the University of Manitoba.

This is about $5500 less than non-Indigenous women, such as Inuit and Métis women,which recorded slightly higher average annual incomes; regardless of the small discrepancy, all of which are substantially less than Statistics Canada’s estimated amount of which an individual living in a large Canadian city would require to meet their needs. It is not unlikely for Aboriginal women living in poverty to not only tend to their own needs, but often tend to the needs of their elderly parents, care for loved ones in ill-health, as well as raising children; all of which is often supported only on a single income. It is believed that homelessness and inadequate shelter are widespread problems facing Aboriginal families, in all settings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Self governance ===
A paramount conclusion by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples is that the repeated assaults on the culture and collective identity of the Aboriginal people has resulted in a weakened foundation of Aboriginal society and has contributed to the alienation that inevitably drives some to self-destructive and antisocial behaviour. The social problems among Aboriginal people are, in large measure, a legacy of history.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://courseware.mymru.ca/bbcswebdav/pid-2984811-dt-content-rid-8719626_1/courses/50730.201404/Amnesty%20International%20--%20Stolen%20Sisters.pdf |title=Stolen Sisters: A Human Rights Response to Discrimination and Violence Against Indigenous Women in Canada |last=Anonymous |date=Winter–Spring 2008 |journal=Canadian Women's Studies |accessdate= |doi= |pmid= }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crime and incarceration ===
{{Further|Gladue report#Over-representation of Aboriginal People in Criminal Justice System|}}
Aboriginals are also more likely to be the victims of crime. This is particularly true in the younger population (aged 15–34), where acts of violence are two and a half times more likely to occur than in the older population. Domestic violence and sexual abuse against children is more prevalent in the Aboriginal population with sexual abuse affecting 25–50% of Aboriginal female children versus 20–25% of female children in the general population.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/cj-jp/victim/rd3-rr3/p3.html|title = Aboriginal Victimization in Canada: A Summary of the Literature|date = April 30, 2013|accessdate = December 13, 2014|website = Victims of Crime Research Digest No. 3|publisher = Canada Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who come from homes with a history of violence are at a greater risk of becoming the perpetrators of violence later in life. This is especially true of males.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As of 2007, 17% of incarcerated individuals in Canada were of Aboriginal descent, despite representing only 2.7% of the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aboriginal Corrections|url=http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/aboriginal/index-eng.shtml|publisher=Correctional Service Canada|accessdate=May 7, 2016|quote="At the end of March 2007, Aboriginal people comprised 17.0% of federally sentenced offenders although the general Aboriginal population is only 2.7% of the Canadian adult population."}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a sixfold increase in rates of incarceration within the Aboriginal population as opposed to the general Canadian population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are many reasons for the over-representation of Aboriginals within the Canadian justice system. Lack of education, poverty, unemployment and abuse all lead to higher crime rates. Also, statistically, Aboriginals have a greater chance of conviction and subsequently, incarceration once convicted. They are also much less likely to receive parole during their sentence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Health ===
The Canadian federal government is responsible for health and social services on the reserve and in Inuit communities, while the provincial and territorial governments provide services elsewhere. The divide between each level of government has led to a gap in services for Aboriginal people living off-reserve and in Canadian towns and cities. Although Aboriginal people living off-reserve have access to the programs and services designed for the general population, these programs and services do not address the specific needs of Aboriginal people, nor is it delivered in a culturally appropriate way. It has not been until recently that the Canadian federal government had to increase recognition to the needs for programs and services for Aboriginal people in predominantly non-Aboriginal communities. It is however funding that lags the growth of urban Aboriginal populations and the uncoordinated delivery of services through various government departments would also pose as a barrier. The federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians pointed out that in 2003 almost 90 percent of the funding for programs designed for Aboriginal peoples is spent on reserves, while off-reserve programs for Aboriginal people are delivered through just 22 federal departments, as well as other provincial and territorial agencies. The federal subcommittee on Indigenous child welfare described a "jurisdictional web" in which there is little to no coordination with or between municipal, provincial and federal levels of government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The health care services available to Aboriginal people is rarely delivered in a culturally sensitive approach. It is the constant cast of "the other" by the settler Canadian population that contaminates the delivery of such necessary services to Aboriginal peoples. It was argued by Ontario finance minister Jim Flaherty in 1992 that the Canadian government could boost health-care funding for "real people in real towns" by cutting the bureaucracy that serves only Aboriginal peoples. These types of statements, especially made by people often heard by a greater audience, are said to have detrimental and influential effects on the overall attitudes of settler population folks, as well as Aboriginal peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Conquest: Sexual Violence and American Indian Genocide|last = Smith|first = Andrea|publisher = South End Press|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0-89608-743-9|location = Cambridge, MA|pages = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diabetes ====
{{main|First Nations and diabetes}}
There are marked differences between the epidemiology of diabetes in First Nation population compared to the general population. Reasons for the different rate of [[Type 2 diabetes|Type 2 Diabetes]] between First Nation and the general population include a complex combination of environmental (lifestyle, diet, poverty) and genetic and biological factors (e.g. [[Thrifty gene hypothesis|thrifty genotype hypothesis]], [[thrifty phenotype]]) &lt;ref&gt;Pollard, T. M. 2008. Western Diseases: An Evolutionary Perspective. Chapter 4: The thrifty genotype versus thrifty phenotype debate: efforts to explain between population variation in rates of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; – though to what extent each factor plays a role is still not clear.&lt;ref name="10.1503/cmaj.090846"&gt;Dyck R, Osgood N, Lin TH, Gao A, and Stang MR (2010) Epidemiology of diabetes mellitus among First Nations and non-First Nations adults. Canadian Medical Association Journal 182:249–256; published ahead of print January 18, 2010, doi:[http://10.1503/cmaj.090846 10.1503/cmaj.090846]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aboriginal population in Canada (First Nations, Inuit and Métis) have a significantly higher prevalence rate of diabetes than the non-Aboriginal population. Age-standardized rates show that the prevalence of diabetes among First Nations individuals living on-reserve is 17.2%; First Nations individuals living off-reserve is 10.3%; Métis individuals 7.3%; and non-Aboriginal peoples at 5.0%. It is important to note that Aboriginal individuals are generally diagnosed at a younger age than non-Aboriginal individuals, and Aboriginal females experience higher rates of gestational diabetes than non-Aboriginal females. The complications and prevalence of diabetes are seen among the Aboriginal population more often than non-Aboriginal population. These may be attributed to the socio-cultural, biological, environmental and lifestyle changes seen in the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis populations, which have been most especially prevalent in the last half century, all of which contributing significantly to the increased rates of diabetes and the complications associated among the Aboriginal population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/cd-mc/publications/diabetes-diabete/facts-figures-faits-chiffres-2011/highlights-saillants-eng.php#chp6|title = Diabetes in Canada: Facts and figures from a public health perspective|date = December 15, 2011|accessdate = |website = Statistics Canada|publisher = Public Health Agency of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Life expectancy ====
[[Life expectancy]] at birth is significantly lower for First Nations babies than for babies in the Canadian population as a whole. {{As of|2001}}, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada estimates First Nations life expectancy to be 8.1 years shorter for males and 5.5 years shorter for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fnih-spni/diseases-maladies/2005-01_health-sante_indicat_e.html |title=First Nations Comparable Health Indicators |work=Health Canada First Nations, Inuit &amp; Aboriginal Health  Diseases &amp; Health Conditions |publisher=Government of Canada |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=May 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512140346/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fnih-spni/diseases-maladies/2005-01_health-sante_indicat_e.html |archivedate=May 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where females in the general population had a life expectancy at birth of 82 years, First Nations females had a life expectancy of 76 years. In males the life expectancy for First Nations individuals was 69 years as opposed to 77 in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aboriginalgba.ca/category.aspx?catid=119&amp;rt=2 |title=Life Expectancy |date=2009 |accessdate=December 13, 2014 |website=Our Voices: First Nations, Metis, and Inuit GBA |publisher=First Nations, Metis, and Inuit GBA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211091413/http://aboriginalgba.ca/category.aspx?catid=119&amp;rt=2 |archivedate=February 11, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons behind the lower life expectancy for First Nations individuals are varied and complex; however, [[social determinants of health]] are thought to play a large part.

==== Suicide ====
Overall, First Nations individuals have some of the highest rates of suicide globally. Suicide rates are more than twice the sex-specific rate and also three times the age-specific rates of non-Aboriginal Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=B.A.|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/sui_nati.htm|title=Suicide among Canada's First Nations|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|date= January 3, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residential Aboriginals between ages 10 and 29 show an elevated suicide risk as compared to non-residential Aboriginals by 5–6 times.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://tps.sagepub.com/content/31/1/3.full.pdf+html|title = Suicide Among Canadian Aboriginal Peoples|last = Kirmayer|first = Laurence J.|date = March 1994|journal = Transcultural Psychiatric Research Review|accessdate = December 14, 2014|doi = 10.1177/136346159403100101|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory for the increased incidences of suicide within Aboriginal populations as compared to the general Canadian population is called acculturation stress which results from the intersection of multiple cultures within one's life. This leads to differing expectations and cultural clashes within the community, the family and the individual. At the community level, a general economic disadvantage is seen, exacerbated by unemployment and low education levels, leading to poverty, political disempowerment and community disorganization. The family suffers through a loss of tradition as they attempt to assimilate into mainstream Canadian culture. These lead to low self-esteem in the individual as First Nations culture and tradition are marginalized affecting one's sense of self-identity. These factors combine to create a world where First Nations individuals feel they cannot identify completely as Aboriginal, nor can they fully identify as mainstream Canadians. When that balance cannot be found, many (particularly youths) turn to suicide as a way out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Drinking water ====
Approximately 400 First Nation communities in Canada have had, and continue to have serious problems with the quality of their drinking water. The residents of Neskantaga First Nation in Ontario have been forced to boil their water for the past 20 years to make it safe.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Levasseur, Jacques Marcoux, [http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/bad-water-third-world-conditions-on-first-nations-in-canada-1.3269500 "Bad water: 'Third World' conditions on First Nations in Canada"], CBC News, October 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.ca/our-work/issues/indigenous-peoples/indigenous-peoples-in-canada/the-right-to-water|title=The Right to Water|date=October 18, 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly elected Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] promised to solve the drinking water problem within five years, by investing $1.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-justin-trudeau-first-nations-boil-water-advisories-1.3258058|title=Trudeau vows to end First Nations reserve boil-water advisories within 5 years |publisher= CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/first-nations-orbis-infrastructure-water-consultants-budgets-1.3780760|title=Feds ask why First Nations projects over budget — Answer?

===Missing and murdered women===
{{main|Missing and murdered Indigenous women}}
{{Further|AmINext|}}
Across Canada, there has been a large number of missing and murdered women of Aboriginal descent since 1980. 16% of female murder victims and 12% of missing women have been Aboriginal, while demographically they comprise only 4% of the overall female population. This amounts to almost 1,200 Aboriginal females either missing or murdered in just over 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/its-time-for-canada-to-act-on-missing-and-murdered-aboriginal-women/article18638089/|title = It’s time for Canada to act on missing and murdered aboriginal women|first=Meghan| last=Rhoad|date = May 13, 2014|accessdate = November 21, 2014|website = Globe and Mail|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) released Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: A National Operational Review. This publication documents the official findings of this demographic as well as advises for future change. It finds that there are 164 Aboriginal women still missing and 1,017 murdered, making for a total of 1,181.&lt;ref name="Royal Canadian Mounted Police"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://site.ebrary.com/lib/uvic/reader.action?docID=10885975|title = Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: A National Operational overview|date = 2014|accessdate = April 8, 2015 |website = |publisher = Royal Canadian Mounted Police }}&lt;/ref&gt; "There are 225 unsolved cases of either missing or murdered Aboriginal females: 105 missing for more than 30 days as of November 4, 2013, whose cause of disappearance was categorized as 'unknown' or 'foul play suspected' and 120 unsolved homicides between 1980 and 2012."&lt;ref name="Royal Canadian Mounted Police"/&gt; Indigenous women in Canada are overrepresented among the missing and murdered females in Canada. Additionally, there are shared characteristics among these cases, most of the murders were committed by men and were someone the victim knew, either a partner or an acquaintance.&lt;ref name="Royal Canadian Mounted Police"/&gt; "Aboriginal women between the ages of 25 and 44 are 5 times more likely than other women of the same age to die as a result of violence"&lt;ref name="KuokkanenGRSV"&gt;Rauna Kuokkanen. "[https://rauna.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/793277480_content.pdf]" 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics portray the severity and prevalence of violence against indigenous women in Canada.

Self-governance and preservation of indigenous territories become increasingly difficult as natural resources continue to be exploited by foreign companies. Projects such as "mining, logging, hydroelectric construction, large-scale export oriented agribusiness or oil exploration"{{attribution needed|date=June 2016}} are usually coupled with environmental degradation and occasionally violence and militarization."{{attribution needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;ref name="KuokkanenGRSV"/&gt;  Many scholars go so far as to link the proliferation of global neoliberalism with a rise in violence.&lt;ref name="KuokkanenGRSV"/&gt;  Women's concerns are nearly always pushed aside, to be addressed later; their safety is therefore often compromised and not deemed priority. Privatization of public services and reduction in the universality of health care produces negative repercussions for those of lower socioeconomic status in rural locations; these downsides are magnified for female Aboriginals.&lt;ref name="KuokkanenGRSV"/&gt;

===Missing and murdered men===
Approximately 2,500 aboriginal people were murdered in Canada between 1982 and 2011, out of 15,000 murders in Canada overall. Of the 2,500 murdered aboriginal Canadians, fully 71 per cent — 1,750 — were male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/adam-jones-aboriginal-men-are-murdered-and-missing-far-more-than-aboriginal-women-a-proper-inquiry-would-explore-both|title = Adam Jones: Aboriginal men are murdered and missing far more than aboriginal women. A proper inquiry would explore both|date = April 27, 2015|accessdate = September 18, 2016|website = National Post|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to summaries of seven consultation sessions posted to a government website, the desire to dedicate some attention to violence against indigenous men and boys has come up at four of the meetings.&lt;ref name=MMAMglobeandmail02012016&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/national-inquiry-should-not-study-violence-against-aboriginal-men-experts/article28498467/|title = National inquiry should not study violence against aboriginal men: experts|first=Kathryn Blake| last=Baum|date = February 1, 2016|accessdate = September 18, 2016|website = The Globe and Mail|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These calls to extend the scope of the inquiry to include missing and murdered aboriginal people of all genders have met with resistance and been criticized as detracting from the current focus on the issue of missing and murdered aboriginal women.  Barbara Bailey, who was on the UN team that visited Canada in 2013 to investigate the violence, has said, "I think to detract now would really be a tragedy. Let’s fix that problem first and then we can begin to see what else is out there."

Speaking on the matter, [[Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs|Minister of Indigenous Affairs]], [[Carolyn Bennett]] has said, "Our mandate now is to get to the bottom of the tragedy of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls in Canada", citing sexism as being of specific concern.  Dawn Lavell-Harvard, the president of the [[Native Women's Association of Canada]], has also weighed in on the issue by saying, "Absolutely [men] deserve the same amount of attention, just not necessarily in the same forum", neither that forum nor an equal level of attention have yet to materialize.&lt;ref name=MMAMglobeandmail02012016 /&gt;

The '''Ida'an''' ('''Idahan''' or '''Eraan''') people are an ethnic group of [[Borneo]], residing primarily in the [[Lahad Datu]] districts on the east coast of [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]].  Their current population is estimated to be around 6,000 (1987 est), but it appears that they once inhabited a much larger area along the east Sabah coast than present. For centuries, the Ida’an have owned exclusive rights to the collection of edible bird's nests in the limestone caves of the region, notably the Madai Caves. Most Ida'an are [[Muslim]], but a small sub-group called the Bega'ak (Dusun Bagahak) (population 1,500 in 1987) have been converted to [[Christianity]] recently, but some of them remains [[animist]].

'''''InsideClimate News''''' is a [[Non-profit journalism|non-profit]] and non-partisan&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; news organization, focusing on [[environmental journalism]].&lt;ref name="Brainard"&gt;Curtis Brainard, [http://archives.cjr.org/the_observatory/insideclimate_news_pulitzer_pr.php InsideClimate wins a Pulitzer], ''Columbia Journalism Review'' (April 16, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The publication writes that it "covers [[clean energy]], [[carbon-based fuel|carbon energy]], [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and [[environmental science]]—plus the territory in between where law, policy and public opinion are shaped."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://insideclimatenews.org/about About InsideClimate News], InsideClimate News. Retrieved May 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Established in 2007, the [[Brooklyn, New York]]-based website covers environmental issues. It won the 2013 [[Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting]] for its coverage of the [[Kalamazoo River oil spill]].&lt;ref name="Brainard"/&gt;

==History==
The website was co-founded in 2007 by publisher David Sassoon and executive editor Stacy Feldman.&lt;ref name=staff&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://insideclimatenews.org/about/staff-and-contributors|title=People|work=InsideClimate News|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called '''''SolveClimate News''''', it adopted its current name "to counter the perception that it was an environmental advocacy organization."&lt;ref name="Brainard"/&gt; As a [[Non-profit journalism|non-profit journalism outlet]], ''InsideClimate News''{{'}}s model is similar to that of [[ProPublica]] and the [[Center for Investigative Reporting]], which have similarly gained recognition.&lt;ref name="Stelter"&gt;[[Brian Stelter]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/business/media/insideclimate-news-hopes-to-build-on-pulitzer.html A Pulitzer Prize, but Without a Newsroom to Put It In], ''New York Times'' (April 16, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Like the other two organizations, ''InsideClimate News'' publishes its content for free on the [[World Wide Web|Web]], collaborates with for-profit news organizations that republish some of the nonprofit's work with credit, and aims "to tackle topics that bigger, better-known news organizations are not equipped or inclined to do."&lt;ref name=Stelter/&gt;

As of February 2018, InsideClimate News had a staff of 18, including 7 fulltime reporters.&lt;ref name=staff/&gt;

== Awards ==
Three ''InsideClimate News'' reporters&amp;mdash;Elizabeth McGowan, Lisa Song, and David Hasemyer&amp;mdash;won the 2013 [[Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting]] for their series of "rigorous reports" on the [[Kalamazoo River oil spill]] in [[Michigan]], in which an [[Enbridge]] [[oil pipeline]] spill led to the costliest onshore oil spill in American history.&lt;ref name="Brainard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pulitzer"&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/National-Reporting The 2013 Pulitzer Prize Winners: National Reporting]. The Pulitzer Prizes. With short biographies, reprints of 11 works (''InsideClimate News'' stories June 26 to December 27, 2012), and formal entry for the prize.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pulitzer citation praised the reporters for exporting the aftermath of the 2010-2012 oil spill and "flawed regulation of the nation's oil pipelines, focusing on potential ecological dangers posed by [[diluted bitumen]] (or 'dilbit'), a controversial form of oil."&lt;ref name="Pulitzer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stelter"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haughney&gt;Haughney, Christine (April 16, 2013).

A19.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2016, ''InsideClimate News'' was named a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]], for the 2015 ''Exxon: The Road Not Taken'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Finalist: InsideClimate News |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/insideclimate-news |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2016 |year=2016 |publisher=[[Columbia University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=InsideClimate News Is a Pulitzer Prize Finalist for Exxon Investigation |date=April 18, 2016 |accessdate=April 25, 2016 |url=http://insideclimatenews.org/news/18042016/insideclimate-news-pulitzer-prize-finalist-exxon-investigation |publisher=InsideClimate News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''InsideClimate News'' was awarded a 2015 [[Sigma Delta Chi Award]] for excellence in journalism by the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] for the informational graphics in the ''Exxon: The Road Not Taken'' series, which "provide a visual timeline of Exxon's views and efforts on climate change since the 1970s, and evidence of its uncertainty campaigns in the 1990s and 2000s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Announcing the 2015 Sigma Delta Chi Award winners |date=April 22, 2016 |publisher=[[Society of Professional Journalists]] |url=http://www.spj.org/news.asp?REF=1435 |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=InsideClimate News Wins SPJ Award for #ExxonKnew Infographics |date=April 22, 2016 |publisher=InsideClimate News |accessdate=April 25, 2016 |url=http://insideclimatenews.org/news/22042016/insideclimate-news-wins-spj-award-exxonknew-infographics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[White House Correspondents Association]] awarded ''InsideClimate News'' a share in the 2016 [[Edgar A.

{{Culture of Bhutan}}
The Central Bodish languages are a group of related [[Tibetic languages]] descended from [[Old Tibetan]] (''Chöke''). Most Bhutanese varieties of Central Bodish languages are of the Southern subgroup. At least six of the nineteen languages and dialects of Bhutan are Central Bodish languages.

The [[Lakha language|Lakha]] (8,000 speakers) and [[Brokkat language]]s (300 speakers) in Central Bhutan, as well as the [[Brokpa language]] (5,000 speakers) in far Eastern Bhutan, are also grouped by Van Driem (1993) into Central Bodish. These languages are remnants of what were originally pastoral [[yak]]herd communities.&lt;ref name=vanDriem93/&gt;

The [[Laya dialect]], closely related to Dzongkha, is spoken near the northwestern border with [[Tibet]] by some 1,100 [[Layap]]s.

[[Khams Tibetan]] is spoken by about 1,000 people in two enclaves in Eastern Bhutan, also the descendants of pastoral yakherding communities.&lt;ref name=vanDriem93/&gt; Although it also is a by all accounts a Tibetic language, its exact subgrouping is uncertain.

==East Bodish languages==

Eight of the languages of Bhutan are [[East Bodish languages]], not members of the closely related Tibetic group but still descended from Old Tibetan or a close kin.&lt;ref name="Driem"&gt;, page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bumthang language]], or ''Bumthangkha'', is the dominant language in Central Bhutan. It has approximately 30,000 speakers. The [[Kheng language|Kheng]] and [[Kurtöp language]]s are closely related to Bumthang. They have 40,000 and 10,000 speakers, respectively. 

The [[Dzala language]], or ''Dzalakha'', has about 15,000 speakers. The [[Nyen language]], also called ''Henkha'' or ''Mangdebikha'', and the [['Ole language]] (also called the "Black Mountain language" or "Mönkha") are spoken in the [[Black Mountains (Bhutan)|Black Mountains]] of Central Bhutan by about 10,000 and 1,000 speakers, respectively. Van Driem (1993) describes 'Ole as the remnant of the primordial population of the Black Mountains before the southward expansion of the ancient East Bodish tribes.&lt;ref name=vanDriem93/&gt;

The [[Dakpa language|Dakpa]] (''Dakpakha'') and [[Chali language|Chali]] (''Chalikha'') languages are each spoken by about 1,000 people in Eastern Bhutan.&lt;ref name=vanDriem93/&gt;

}}
Other Tibeto-Burman languages are spoken in Bhutan. These languages are more distantly related to the [[Bodish languages]], and are not necessarily members of any common subgroup.

The [[Tshangla language]], a subfamily of its own of the [[Bodish languages]], has approximately 138,000 speakers. It is the mother tongue of the [[Sharchops]]. It is the dominant language in Eastern Bhutan and was formerly spoken as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in the region.&lt;ref name=vanDriem93/&gt;

The [[Gongduk language]] is an endangered language that has approximately 1,000 speakers in isolated villages along the [[Kuri Chhu]] river in Eastern Bhutan. It appears to be the sole representative of a unique branch of the Tibeto-Burman language family,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Himalayan Languages Project |authorlink=Himalayan Languages Project |title=Gongduk |work= |publisher=Himalayan Languages Project |url=http://www.himalayanlanguages.org/?q=languages/gongduk |accessdate=2009-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726151453/http://www.himalayanlanguages.org/?q=languages%2Fgongduk |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and retains the complex verbal agreement system of Proto-Tibeto-Burman.&lt;ref name=SIL2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=goe |title=Gongduk: A language of Bhutan |work=[[Ethnologue]] Online |publisher=[[SIL International]] |location=[[Dallas]] |accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Driem (1993) describes its speakers as a remnant of the ancient population of Central Bhutan before the southward expansion of the East Bodish tribes.&lt;ref name=vanDriem93/&gt;

The [[Lepcha language]] has approximately 2,000 ethnic [[Lepcha people]] in Bhutan.&lt;ref name=vanDriem93/&gt; It has its own highly stylized [[Lepcha script]].

The [[Lhokpu language]] has approximately 2,500 speakers. It is one of the autochthonous languages of Bhutan and is yet unclassified within Tibeto-Burmese. Van Driem (1993) describes it as the remnant of "the primordial population of Western Bhutan," and comments that Lhokpu or a close relative appears to have been the substrate language for Dzongkha, explaining the various ways in which Dzongkha diverged from Tibetan.&lt;ref name=vanDriem93/&gt; It is spoken by the [[Lhop people]].

==Indo-Aryan==
The [[Nepali language]] is the only [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] spoken by native Bhutanese. Inside Bhutan, it is spoken primarily in the south by the approximately 2,00,000 resident [[Lhotshampa]] as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnologue'' 16&lt;/ref&gt; While the Lhotshampa are generally regarded as Nepali speakers, the Lhotshampa include many smaller non-Indo-Aryan groups such as the [[Tamang]]&lt;ref name=Rep&amp;Wal/&gt; and [[Gurung]]&lt;ref name=Rep&amp;Wal&gt;{{cite book|first1=Sarah |last1=Repucci |first2=Christopher |last2=Walker |title=Countries at the Crossroads: A Survey of Democratic Governance |year=2005 |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |pages=92 |isbn=0-7425-4972-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Southern Bhutan, and the [[Kirant]]i groups (including the [[Rai people|Rai]] and [[Limbu people|Limbu]] peoples) found in Eastern Bhutan. Among these minorities are speakers of [[Camling language|Chamling]], [[Limbu language|Limbu]], and [[Nepal Bhasa]].

==Border languages==
The [[Sikkimese language|Sikkimese]] and [[Groma language]]s, both [[Tibetan languages]], are spoken along the Sikkim-Bhutan and Tibet-Bhutan borders in Western Bhutan. {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The [[Toto language]] is generally classified as belonging to the [[West Himalayish languages|sub-Himalayan]] branch of the Tibeto-Burman family.&lt;ref name=Kolig/&gt; It is spoken by the isolated [[Toto tribe]] in [[Totopara]] and along the [[West Bengal]]-Bhutan border in South Bhutan.

The lion lights were devised by [[Maasai people|Maasai]] Richard Turere to prevent night attacks by lions on his family's [[cattle]] herd, which was in [[Kitengela]] on the unfenced south side of [[Nairobi National Park]], in [[Kenya]]. These types of attacks often lead to the hunting and killing of the lions, which are endangered.

When Richard Turere was 9 he tried kerosene lamps and [[scarecrow]]s but these proved not to work, but he noticed that the lions did not attack when people were present, and he theorised that they were deterred by moving torchlight. Therefore, Turere &lt;ref name="paula"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnXbRO3CcTQ Lion Li/]&lt;/ref&gt; placed LED lights around the perimeter of his family's cow shed, connected them to vehicle indicator flashers, and powered the system from car batteries charged by a solar panel.

The lion attacks ceased and soon neighbours were asking for him to set up similar systems around their farms.&lt;ref name="paula"/&gt; The cattle were also calmer because the lights meant that they could see the land around was safe.

Based on this invention, Turere won a scholarship to [[Brookhouse School]].&lt;ref name="paula"/&gt;

Although originally intended for lions, lion lights may also work for other predators such as [[leopard]]s and [[cheetah]]s.

The following peoples  are officially recognized '''minor indigenous peoples of Russia'''. Many of them are included into the ''Common List of Minor Indigenous Peoples of Russia'' ({{lang|ru|Единый перечень коренных малочисленных народов России}}) approved by the government of Russia on March 24, 2000.

These peoples satisfy the following criteria:
*To live in their historical territory;
*To preserve traditional way of life, occupations, and trades;
*To self-recognize themselves as a separate ethnicity;
*There should be at most 50,000 of population within Russia.

Some of them, such as [[Soyots]], were recognized only after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

These peoples subject to benefits according to a number of laws aimed at preservation and support of these ethnicities.

Ten of these peoples count less than 1,000 and 11 of them live beyond the [[Arctic Circle]].

===Birth Rate===
The below table gives the average birth rate for Smaller Ethnic groups for the 1997-2002 period based on the 2002 census. (per 1000 people) Source: [http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/TOM_13_03.xls] For most of the groups the birth rate was more than the death rate. For example for the Yuraq Samoyeds the birth rate was more than double the death rate. But for ethnic groups like Veps (Death rate 7 times the birth rate) the reverse was true. For Ingrians, not a single birth was recorded in 1992-2002 period. The youngest of the Ingrians are 3 people in 10-14 age group (Total ethnic population 327, of which more than 60% are above 70 years of age. The 1989 population was 820, signifying a decline of 2.5 times)

The '''Mikea''' are a group of [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]-speaking [[horticulturalists]] and [[Hunter-gatherer|forager]]s who are often described as the lowland [[hunter-gatherer]]s of [[Madagascar]].  They inhabit the [[Mikea Forest]], a patch of mixed [[Madagascar spiny thickets|spiny forest]] and [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|dry deciduous forest]] along the coast of southwestern Madagascar. The Mikea are predominantly of [[Sakalava people|Sakalava]] origin, although the term describes a lifestyle rather than an ethnic group ''per se'', and individuals from a variety of [[Malagasy people|Malagasy ethnic groups]] are found among the Mikea. The family encampments of the Mikea shift from prime corn planting territory at the edge of the forest in the rainy season to the interior forest rich with [[tenrec]]s and other game in the dry season, when the community becomes highly dependent on spongy tubers to meet their daily demand for water. Their lifestyle is interdependent with that of their neighboring [[Vezo]] fishermen and the [[Masikoro]] farmers and herders, with whom they trade products caught, foraged or cultivated in the forest. Many Mikea also occasionally engage in paid work such as guarding the [[zebu]] herds or tending the corn fields of others.

The present-day Mikea are not a remnant of an ancient Malagasy hunter-gatherer society, but are instead descendants of individuals who took refuge in the forest beginning in the 1800s to escape military conflict, heavy taxation and other oppressive factors. Their way of life is perceived by villagers and city dwellers alike as ancestral, contributing to a mystique about them that has inspired various myths and legends. They are commonly believed to be the mythical [[Vazimba]], the original inhabitants of the island, although there is no evidence to support this view. They are distinct from the [[Beosi]] hunter-gatherers of the highlands. While some 1,500 individuals are known to identify as Mikea, many Malagasy disbelieve that the community continues to exist in the present day.

==Ethnic identity==
The Mikea are [[hunter-gatherer]]s (also called foragers) who practice limited farming.&lt;ref name=tubers&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stiles | first1 = Daniel  | title = Tubers and Tenrecs: The Mikea of Southwestern Madagascar | journal = Field Actions Science Reports [online] | volume = 30 | issue = 30 | year = 1991 |pages = 251–263 |jstor = 3773634 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mikea'' label is applied to those who live this subsistence lifestyle rather than being tied to a specific [[ethnic groups of Madagascar|ethnicity]].{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=27}} There are numerous groups termed Mikea along the west and southwest coast of [[Madagascar]], with the majority living in and around the [[Madagascar spiny thickets|spiny]] [[Mikea Forest]] on the southwestern coast between [[Morombe]] and [[Toliara]],{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=220}} an area extending 2500 square kilometers. Historically this main concentration of Mikea may have extended as far south as the [[Fiherenana River]] and as far north as the [[Mangoky River]]; another main cluster of Mikea live to the west and southwest of [[Lake Ihotry]].{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=215}} They are typically considered a subset of the [[Sakalava people|Sakalava]] ethnic group,{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=220}} although there are Mikea individuals who trace their origins to other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=27}} Their adherence to a way of life perceived by villagers and city dwellers as ancestral has contributed to a mystique and various myths and legends about them, and many Malagasy believe they are the descendents of [[Vazimba]], the original inhabitants of the island, although there is no evidence to support this view.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=215}} The majority of Malagasy believe the existence of the Mikea to be a myth and are unaware that any Malagasy continue to live the Mikea lifestyle to the present day.&lt;ref name=Ecology&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stiles | first1 = Daniel | title = The Mikea Hunter-Gatherers of Southwest Madagascar: Ecology and Socioeconomics | journal = African Study Monographs | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | year = 1998 |pages = 127–148 |url = http://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/68175/1/ASM_19_127.pdf |accessdate= 17 August 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Mikea is principally used by outsiders to label this group and is not often used by members of this community themselves.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=215}} Most Mikea prefer to call themselves either Vezo-Mikea or Masikoro-Mikea, depending on their specific family lineages.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}}

==History==
[[File:Mikea Forest, Madagascar - map 01.svg|thumb|left|200px|The majority of the Mikea live in the [[Mikea Forest]] between [[Toliara]] and [[Morombe]].]]

The Mikea are not remnants of an early hunter-gatherer society. Although researchers remain uncertain when the Mikea first adopted a forest-dwelling, hunter-gatherer lifestyle, they have determined that the Mikea were only recently established as a community.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=27}} The current Mikea population is believed to be descended largely from [[Masikoro]] villagers who fled into the forest to escape advancing [[Kingdom of Imerina|Merina]] and Sakalava armies in the 18th and 19th centuries. Colonial French documents dating to 1901 describe hunter gatherers by the name of Mikea living in the southwest of the island. The population is believed to have swelled during the [[Malagasy Uprising|1947 uprising]] against [[French Madagascar|French colonial rule]], when many Malagasy families left towns and villages to hide in forests across the country.  Oil exploration in the 1950s and 1960s entailed cutting paths through the formerly untouched forests of the southwest, which further contributed to the migration of villagers into the forest to adopt the Mikea lifestyle.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=215}}

==Society==
Mikea are subject to national laws like all Malagasy citizens but in practice national laws, government and social services do not reach this population while dwelling in the forest.  Within Mikea forest encampments an egalitarian form of self-government predominates, with the eldest male family member having the main decision-making authority for the group. This is in contrast to certain ethnic groups, such as the Merina, who had a complex form of social organization that overlaid a caste system with specific social roles assigned to particular family groups.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}} In 1991, an estimated 1,500 Malagasy were living the Mikea lifestyle, primarily around the [[Mikea Forest]],{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=215}} an area that receives limited rainfall.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=216}} This number was estimated at several hundred in the 1950s, suggesting a growth in population. The true number of people living from forest scavenging is difficult to estimate with accuracy, as the label "Mikea" is very flexible, and the degree of reliance on scavenging as opposed to seasonal farming can vary significantly at any given time depending on economic and environmental conditions.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=215}} The Mikea are subject to social stigma&lt;ref name=hunters/&gt; linked to their image as primitive or uncivilized people.&lt;ref name=mystification&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poyer | first1 = Lin | last2 = Kelly | first2 = Robert | title = Mystification of the Mikea: Constructions of Foraging Identity in Southwest Madagascar | journal = Journal of Anthropological Research | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | year = 2000 |pages = 163–185 |jstor = 3631361 | ref = harv | doi=10.1086/jar.56.2.3631361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housing and social organization among the Mikea can vary from one individual or community to the next. Some Mikea remain in the forest their entire lives, while others live part of their lives in villages or towns. While living in the forest, groups of Mikea typically move seasonally between encampments nearest to critical resources. In the rainy season, they often live in groups of 30-50 people near tracts of virgin forest in proximity to their newly cleared and planted corn fields. The houses in this settlement are square with peaked roofs, as elsewhere in Madagascar, and are typically made of thatch and bark on a wooden pole frame. These houses are loosely clustered with generous space between each lodging. The rainy season encampment serves for three to five years as a base for forest foraging before resource depletion requires a move to a new location. Those working the corn fields may live in simple grass shelters alongside their crops until April or May, when they return to the bark houses.&lt;ref name=hunters/&gt; During the dry season from May to October, the encampment splits into smaller groups{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}} that relocate deeper into the forest&lt;ref name=hunters/&gt; to settle near ''babo'' tuber patches, with dwellings limited to brush shelters and thatch sunshades, and some individuals not living in shelters at all.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}} In both types of settlements furniture is nearly non-existent and Mikea typically sleep in the sand or pits dug at the base of giant termite mounds.&lt;ref name=hunters&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stiles | first = Daniel | title = Hunters of the Great Red Island | journal = Geographical | year = July 2007 |pages = 46–48 |url = https://www.academia.edu/5003243/MADAGASCARS_MIKEA |accessdate= 17 August 2014 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mikea struggle to ensure the quality of life they seek. While the forest has long provided for their basic needs, deforestation and population growth are straining resources. In addition, Mikea are increasingly seeking to obtain better quality material goods for themselves, such as clothing, which necessitates greater engagement with the external economy through trade and wage labor to earn [[Malagasy ariary|local currency]]. Lack of access to social services such as education and health clinics are also taking their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea Forest area and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and skin disease are disproportionately prevalent.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=218}}

===Family affiliation===
Mikea tend to trace their lineage back to specific villages within one or more of three main lineages, associated respectively with the northern, southern and central parts of the Mikea Forest. Most also have relatives living in Vezo and/or Masikoro villages in the region.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}} Many Mikea families have established ''ziva'' (a "[[joking relationship]]", commonly found in southern and eastern Africa) with the Vohitse Vanovato clan of the Masikoro, which indicates a degree of familial closeness with this subclan.&lt;ref name=Etude&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dina | first1 = Jeanne | last2 = Hoerner | first2 = Jean-Michel | title = Etude sur la population Mikea du sud-ouest de Madagascar | journal = Omaly Sy Anio (Hier Et Aujourd'hui): revue d'études historiques | volume = 3-4 | year = 1976 |pages = 269–286 |url = http://madarevues.recherches.gov.mg/IMG/pdf/omaly3-4_6_.pdf |accessdate= 17 August 2014 | ref = harv | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikea encampments are typically family groups. These consist of an elder couple, their married sons and daughters-in-law, the grandchildren of these marriages, and the elder couple's own unmarried children of any age. Adult daughters typically move to join their husband's family encampment upon marriage, but married couples often share their time between the husband's or wife's parents' encampments.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}} Family unions are formed through a ''fandeo'' ceremony in which the man is presented to his intended bride's family, and the acceptance of her parents legitimizes the union. Children of the marriage are legitimized by the husband's bestowal of presents to his wife's parents. The relationship between the wife's brother (''renilahy'', "male mother") and her children can be very strong in Mikea marriages, and the renilahy will commonly adopt children that his sister's husband does not legitimize. Both the husband and the wife have the right to divorce at any time and remarry. Polygamy is also practiced.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=218}}

===Religious affiliation===
Like other Malagasy, the Mikea spiritual belief system revolves around respect for ancestors.  They also share the common Malagasy belief in a creator god, termed Andrianajanahary.  Many Mikea believe in various types of forest spirits (''koko''), which are associated with certain natural spots in the forest deemed sacred; these sites serve as the focus of various ceremonies, in which rum has spiritual and symbolic significance. The greatest of the nature spirits is Ndrianazo, the lord of the forest.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}}  The extended family group, which spreads through multiple encampments, is united around a central priest figure, the ''mpitoka hazomanga'', who officiates over major family ceremonies dedicated to the ancestors.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}}  In addition, within each encampment is at least one ''ombiasy'' (wiseman) who interprets the will of the ancestors and spirits, and plays important roles in such ceremonies as marriage, circumcision, blessings, ancestral rituals, funerals, and ''tromba'' and ''bilo'' spirit possession ceremonies. Some also practice ''sikidy'' and other forms of divination, and provide spiritual advice on the best days or places to hunt, plant, shift camp, and other such events of daily life.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=218}}

==Culture==
The Mikea are culturally and linguistically nearly identical to the neighboring [[Vezo people|Vezo]] fishing clan and Masikoro herding and farming clan of the Sakalava; only the traditional source of livelihood distinguishes the three groups.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=215}} The popular association of the Mikea with the ancestral Vazimba clan has contributed to widespread belief that the Mikea possess Vazimba attributes, such as being small in stature, unclothed, shy and avoidant of contact with outsiders, and living in perfect harmony with the natural environment. None of these are borne out by evidence.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=215}}

The Mikea are known to make masks – a rarity in Madagascar – using human teeth and hair.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=234}}

===Dance and music===
Music is a significant part of Mikea social and spiritual life. Specific songs are associated with a wide range of life events and ceremonies, including ''havoaza'' (funerals), ''bilo'' (magical healing rituals), ''tromba'' (spirit possession), ''ringa'' (martial arts matches), ''savatsy'' (circumcision ceremonies) and more. Most music is vocal - often making use of whistling, shouts and other vocal effects in addition to singing - with percussion accompaniment ranging from handclapping to djembe or ''langoro'' drums. Conch shells and the ''jejy lava'' (stringed instrument with a gourd resonator, played with a bow) are also performed; both of these ancient instruments are increasingly rare in Madagascar and among the Mikea the latter is performed by men for one another. Rarer and more costly instruments like the ''[[marovany]]'' wooden box zither and the ''[[valiha]]'' bamboo tube zither are used for certain sacred rituals that invoke the ancestors. The marovany or valiha player is typically paid a ''fomba'' monetary tribute to perform the ceremonial music.  Many songs are accompanied by specific dances and rituals that continue to be practiced among the Mikea in daily life.&lt;ref name=music&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Stiles | first1 = Daniel | title = Madagascar: Music of Mikea Province | year = 2014 |url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/madagascar-music-of-mikea-province-mw0000607772 | publisher = Allmusic.com |accessdate= 17 August 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Mikea speak a dialect of the [[Malagasy language]], which originated in southern [[Borneo]].  Their dialect is close to that spoken by the [[Vezo people|Vezo]] fishing clan and Masikoro herding clan of the [[Sakalava people]].{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=215}}

Speculation that there may be remnants of a [[Vazimba]] language in Mikea speech was investigated by Blench &amp; Walsh (2009) and found wanting. They concluded,
: "[The] data is so exiguous and so scattered, that it is unlikely to constitute a significant record of a substrate vocabulary, as opposed to a set of idiosyncratic words, not untypical for a population of former foragers."

The speech of the [[Beosi people]], short-statured hunter-gatherers of the highlands, has a higher proportion of unidentifiable vocabulary.

==Economy==
The arid conditions of the spiny forest, which receives less than 600 millimeters of rainfall each year, largely shape Mikea economic activities. Nearly everything they consume is scavenged from the forest,{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=216}} and the average Mikea needs two hours or less to collect adequate food for the day.&lt;ref name=hunters/&gt; Their main source of food is tubers,{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=216}} particularly during the dry season when few other foods may be reliably available.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}} Adults and children of both genders work to dig up using a metal-tipped digging stick (''antsoro'') and a digging bowl (''kipao''). The starchy ''ovy'' tuber is roasted or boiled before eating, while the Mikea eat the watery ''babo'' (or ''baboho'') raw for hydration or use its water for boiling other foods; the ''tavolo'' tuber is dried and ground to make a flour that is sold at village markets. They also gather forest fruits, melons and honey, with the latter a particularly important source of income for the Mikea{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=216}} during the rainy season.&lt;ref name=hunters/&gt; To obtain water during the rainy season the Mikea capture rain run-off from the rooftops of their houses using hollowed-out logs{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=216}} or transport water on foot or zebu-drawn wagon from the villages,{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}} while during the cool dry season the Mikea consume their store of water-engorged ''babo'' tubers{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=216}} and drink water from natural or man-made wells when possible.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}}

Key protein sources include birds and [[tenrec]]s. Mikea adults and children of both sexes use clubs&lt;ref name=hunters/&gt; to kill the small tenrec (''tambotrika'', 0.4 kilograms), which is widespread year round, and the larger one (''tandraka'', 2-3 kilograms), which is mainly caught during the rainy season. To a lesser extent they also hunt or trap two to three species of lemur, feral cats, occasional wild boars,{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=216}} turtles and rodents using blowguns, spears and dogs,&lt;ref name=hunters/&gt; and use a hook and line to catch fish in saline inland lakes. Some Mikea raise animals for food or sale at market, including goats, chickens and guinea fowl; tree nuts also provide additional protein.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=216}}

The principal crop of the Mikea is corn, which was introduced to Madagascar in the 1890s.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=215}} They also occasionally grow manioc. The dry season is used to cut new corn fields, which are burned in October ([[swidden-fallow agriculture|swidden]] agriculture, locally termed ''hatsaky''&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite journal | last = Blanc-Pamard | first = Chantal | title = The Mikea Forest Under Threat (southwest Madagascar): How public policy leads to conflicting territories | journal = Field Actions Science Reports [online] | volume = 3 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.5091/plecevo.2011.513 |url = http://factsreports.revues.org/341 |accessdate= 17 August 2014| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and planted in November and December as the rains begin to fall. This corn is harvested three months later and consumed during the wet season;{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=216}} surplus is dried and sold,{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}} with some saved for the following year's planting and consumption.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=216}} The traders who gather the maize from the Mikea process it for international export at a significant profit.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}}

The Mikea live in a symbiotic relationship with the neighboring Masikoro farmers and herders, and the Vezo fishing clan. The Mikea live primarily on food scavenged from the forest but also grow seasonal crops. Their mobility and reliance on scavenging as opposed to crop growing shifts in response to changes in environmental and economic pressures on availability of resources within the Mikea community as well as those of their Vezo and Masikoro neighbors.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=215}} The Mikea sell their forest products, as well as woven mats and food animals they raise, at weekly Vezo and Masikoro markets in nearby villages to obtain the necessities they cannot scavenge, such as clothing and medicine. Some Mikea migrate for periods of time to work in local villages or the town of Morombe. They are also hired to work for Vezo and Masikoro villagers,{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}} such as by cutting forest for villagers or other Mikeas' corn fields, or guarding villagers' zebu herds. They occasionally acquire one or more zebu in addition to or in lieu of payment, as these are seen as a form of wealth and are mainly sacrificed in ancestral ceremonies rather than eaten as food.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=216}} The rainy season is the time when Mikea are most likely to leave their scavenging encampments for wage labor opportunities in villages or for the corn harvest. This is also the time when Masikoro and Vezo villagers are most likely to move into the forest to grow corn.{{sfn|Kelly|Rabedimy|Poyer|1999|p=217}}

'''Molecular self-assembly''' is the process by which [[molecule]]s adopt a defined arrangement without guidance or management from an outside source. There are two types of [[self-assembly]].  These are '''intramolecular''' self-assembly and '''intermolecular''' self-assembly. Commonly, the term molecular self-assembly refers to intermolecular self-assembly, while the intramolecular analog is more commonly called [[Folding (chemistry)|folding]].

==Supramolecular systems==
Molecular self-assembly is a key concept in [[supramolecular chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lehn, J.-M. |journal=[[Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English|Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.]]|title=Perspectives in Supramolecular Chemistry-From Molecular Recognition towards Molecular Information Processing and Self-Organization|volume=27|issue=11|year=1988|pages=89–121|doi=10.1002/anie.198800891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lehn, J.-M. |journal=[[Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English|Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.]]|title=Supramolecular Chemistry-Scope and Perspectives: Molecules, Supermolecules, and Molecular Devices (Nobel Lecture)|volume=29|issue=11|year=1990|pages=1304–1319|doi=10.1002/anie.199013041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Lehn, J.-M.|title=Supramolecular Chemistry: Concepts and Perspectives|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=|isbn=978-3-527-29311-7|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because assembly of molecules in such systems is directed through noncovalent interactions (e.g., [[hydrogen bond]]ing, metal coordination, [[hydrophobic effect|hydrophobic forces]], [[van der Waals force]]s, [[pi-pi interaction|π-π interactions]], and/or electrostatic) as well as electromagnetic interactions. Common examples include the formation of [[micelle]]s, [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]], [[liquid crystal]] phases, and [[Monolayer|Langmuir monolayer]]s by [[surfactant]] molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rosen, Milton J.|title=Surfactants and interfacial phenomena|year=2004|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-471-47818-8|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples of [[supramolecular assemblies]] demonstrate that a variety of different shapes and sizes can be obtained using molecular self-assembly.&lt;ref name=ariga&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/1468-6996/9/1/014109|pmid=27877935|pmc=5099804|title=Challenges and breakthroughs in recent research on self-assembly|year=2008|last1=Ariga|first1=Katsuhiko|first2=Jonathan P|first3=Michael V|first4=Ajayan|first5=Richard|first6=Somobrata|journal=Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume=9|issue=1|pages=014109|last2=Hill|last3=Lee|last4=Vinu|last5=Charvet|last6=Acharya|bibcode=2008STAdM...9a4109A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecular self-assembly allows the construction of challenging molecular [[topology|topologies]]. One example is [[Borromean ring]]s, interlocking rings wherein removal of one ring unlocks each of the other rings. DNA has been used to prepare a [[Molecular Borromean rings|molecular analog of Borromean rings]].&lt;ref name=Mao1997&gt;{{Cite journal|year = 1997|title = Assembly of Borromean rings from DNA|journal = Nature|volume = 386|issue = 6621|pages = 137–138|doi = 10.1038/386137b0|pmid = 9062186|bibcode = 1997Natur.386..137M |author1 = Mao|first1 = C|last2 = Sun|first2 = W|last3 = Seeman|first3 = N. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a similar structure has been prepared using non-biological building blocks.&lt;ref name=Chichak2004&gt;{{Cite journal|year = 2004|title = Molecular Borromean Rings|journal = Science|volume = 304|issue = 5675|pages = 1308–1312|doi = 10.1126/science.1096914|pmid = 15166376|bibcode = 2004Sci...304.1308C |author1 = Chichak|first1 = K.

==Biological systems==
Molecular self-assembly underlies the construction of biologic [[macromolecular assembly|macromolecular assemblies]] in living organisms, and so is crucial to the function of [[cell (biology)|cells]]. It is exhibited in the self-assembly of [[lipid]]s to form the [[cell membrane|membrane]], the formation of double helical DNA through hydrogen bonding of the individual strands, and the assembly of proteins to form [[quaternary structure]]s. Molecular self-assembly of incorrectly folded proteins into insoluble [[amyloid]] fibers is responsible for infectious [[prion]]-related neurodegenerative diseases. Molecular self-assembly of nanoscale structures plays a role in the [[developmental biology|growth]] of the remarkable [[Beta-keratin|β-keratin]] [[Lamella (anatomy)|lamellae]]/[[setae]]/[[spatulae (biology)|spatulae]] structures used to give [[gecko]]s the ability to [[Gecko adhesion|climb walls and adhere to ceilings and rock overhangs]].&lt;ref name=Min2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Min|first=Younjin|title=The role of interparticle and external forces in nanoparticle assembly|journal=Nature Materials|volume=7|issue=7|pages=527–38|year=2008|doi=10.1038/nmat2206|pmid=18574482|bibcode = 2008NatMa...7..527M |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Santos2007&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Adhesion Science and Technology  |year=2007 |volume=21 |issue=12–13 |pages=1317–1341 |doi=10.1163/156856107782328399|title=Directional adhesion for climbing: theoretical and practical considerations |quote=''Gecko "feet and toes are a hierarchical system of complex structures consisting of lamellae, setae,and spatulae. The distinguishing characteristics of the gecko adhesion system have been described [as] (1) anisotropic attachment, (2) high pulloff force to preload ratio, (3) low detachment force, (4) material independence, (5) self-cleaning, (6) anti-self sticking and (7) non-sticky default state. ... The gecko’s adhesive structures are made from ß-keratin (modulus of elasticity [approx.] 2 GPa). Such a stiff material is not inherently sticky; however, because of the gecko adhesive’s hierarchical nature and extremely small distal features (spatulae are [approx.] 200 nm in size), the gecko’s foot is able to intimately conform to the surface and generate significant attraction using [[van der Waals forces]].''|last1=Santos |first1=Daniel |last2=Spenko |first2=Matthew |last3=Parness |first3=Aaron |last4=Kim |first4=Sangbae |last5=Cutkosky |first5=Mark }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nanotechnology==

Molecular self-assembly is an important aspect of [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] approaches to [[nanotechnology]]. Using molecular self-assembly the final (desired) structure is programmed in the shape and functional groups of the molecules. Self-assembly is referred to as a 'bottom-up' manufacturing technique in contrast to a 'top-down' technique such as [[photolithography|lithography]] where the desired final structure is carved from a larger block of matter. In the speculative vision of [[molecular nanotechnology]], microchips of the future might be made by molecular self-assembly. An advantage to constructing nanostructure using molecular self-assembly for biological materials is that they will degrade back into individual molecules that can be broken down by the body.

===DNA nanotechnology===
{{main|DNA nanotechnology}}
DNA nanotechnology is an area of current research that uses the bottom-up, self-assembly approach for nanotechnological goals. DNA nanotechnology uses the unique [[molecular recognition]] properties of [[DNA]] and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties.&lt;ref name=Seeman2003&gt;{{cite journal|author = Seeman, N. C. |year = 2003|title = DNA in a material world|journal = Nature|volume = 421|issue=6921|pages = 427–431|doi = 10.1038/nature01406|pmid = 12540916|bibcode = 2003Natur.421..427S }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA is thus used as a structural material rather than as a carrier of biological information, to make structures such as complex 2D and 3D lattices (both tile-based as well as using the "[[DNA origami]]" method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]].&lt;ref name=Chen1991&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Chen, J.  |author2=Seeman, N. C.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year = 1991|title = Synthesis from DNA of a molecule with the connectivity of a cube|journal = Nature|volume = 350|issue = 6319|pages = 631–633|doi = 10.1038/350631a0|pmid = 2017259|bibcode = 1991Natur.350..631C }}&lt;/ref&gt; These DNA structures have also been used as templates in the assembly of other molecules such as [[Colloidal gold|gold nanoparticles]]&lt;ref name=Mirkin1996&gt;{{cite journal|year = 1996|title = A DNA-based method for rationally assembling nanoparticles into macroscopic materials|journal = Nature|volume = 382|issue = 6592|pages = 607–609|doi = 10.1038/382607a0|pmid =8757129|bibcode = 1996Natur.382..607M |author1 = Mirkin|first1 = C. A.|last2 = Letsinger|first2 = R. L.|last3 = Mucic|first3 = R. C.|last4 = Storhoff|first4 = J. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[streptavidin]] proteins.&lt;ref name=Yan2003&gt;{{Cite journal|year = 2003|title = DNA-Templated Self-Assembly of Protein Arrays and Highly Conductive Nanowires|journal = Science|volume = 301|issue = 5641|pages = 1882–1884|doi = 10.1126/science.1089389|pmid = 14512621|bibcode = 2003Sci...301.1882Y |author1 = Yan|first1 = H|last2 = Park|first2 = S. H.|last3 = Finkelstein|first3 = G|last4 = Reif|first4 = J. H.|last5 = Labean|first5 = T. H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two-dimensional monolayers==
{{main|Monolayer}}
The spontaneous assembly of a single layer of molecules at interfaces is usually referred to as two-dimensional self-assembly. One of the common examples of such assemblies are [[Langmuir–Blodgett film|Langmuir-Blodgett]] monolayers and multilayers of surfactants. Non-surface active molecules can assemble into ordered structures as well. Early direct proofs showing that non-surface active molecules can assemble into higher-order architectures at solid interfaces came with the development of [[scanning tunneling microscopy]] and shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=Fos1988&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Foster, J. S.  |author2=Frommer, J. E.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1988|title=Imaging of liquid crystals using a tunnelling microscope|journal=Nature|volume=333|issue=6173|pages=542–545|doi=10.1038/333542a0|bibcode=1988Natur.333..542F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually two strategies became popular for the self-assembly of 2D architectures, namely self-assembly following ultra-high-vacuum deposition and annealing and self-assembly at the solid-liquid interface.&lt;ref name=Rab1991&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rabe, J.P.  |author2=Buchholz, S.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1991|title=Commensurability and Mobility in Two-Dimensional Molecular Patterns on Graphite|journal=Science|volume=253|issue=5018|pages=424–427|doi=10.1126/science.253.5018.424|bibcode=1991Sci...253..424R|jstor=2878886 |pmid=17746397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of molecules and conditions leading to the formation of highly-crystalline architectures is considered today a form of 2D [[crystal engineering]] at the [[nanoscopic scale]].

'''Palestinians in Jordan''' refers to people with Palestinian citizenship of Palestinian refugee status living in Jordan or sometimes all those of full or partial [[Palestinian people|Palestinian ancestry]] living in [[Jordan]]. Most Palestinian ancestors came to Jordan as [[Palestinian refugee]]s between 1947 and 1967. Today, most Palestinians and their descendants in Jordan are fully naturalized, making Jordan the only Arab country to fully integrate the Palestinian refugees of 1948.

In Jordan, there is no official census data for how many inhabitants are Palestinians and it rather depends on the definition of who is a Palestinian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=66302 |title=Assessment for Palestinians in Jordan |work=[[Minorities at Risk]] |date=2006 |accessdate=24 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101101403/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=66302 |archivedate=1 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2.1 million Palestinians are registered as refugees,&lt;ref name="unjo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/jordan|title=Jordan - UNRWA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCBSJordan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_PalestiniansEOY2012E.pdf |title=Palestinians at the end of 2012 |publisher=[[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] |year=2009 |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MRPalestinians"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minorityrights.org/minorities/palestinians-2/ |title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - Jordan - Palestinians |work=[[Minority Rights Group International]] |date=2008 |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; not including many Jordanians of Palestinian origin not registered as refugees with the [[UNRWA]].{{fact|date=June 2018}} As of 2014, around 370,000 live in [[Palestine refugee camps#Jordan|ten refugee camps]], with the biggest one being [[Baqa'a refugee camp]] with over 104,000 residents, followed by [[Amman New Camp]] (Wihdat) with over 51,500 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/jordan |title=Where We Work - Jordan |work=[[UNRWA]] |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Anthony Giordano''' (born March 25, 1963) is the former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] mayor of [[Waterbury, Connecticut]], and a convicted [[sex offender]]. He was born in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], to [[Italian people|Italian]] parents and his family moved to the [[United States]] when he was two years old.

A lawyer, former [[Connecticut House of Representatives|state representative]] and former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] (1981–1985), Giordano served three terms as mayor after being elected for the first time in 1995. In 2000, he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the [[U.S. Senate]], losing to [[Joe Lieberman]].

==Mayor of Waterbury, Connecticut==
Giordano was elected Mayor in 1995, defeating seven-term Democratic Mayor Edward "Mike" Bergin&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waterburyobserver.org/wod7/node/2832&lt;/ref&gt; by 52% to 45%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=512754&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected with 53% of the vote in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=358450&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as mayor, he claimed to have balanced Waterbury's budget, but prior to his arrest a state oversight board had to intervene as a result of chronic [[pension]] underfunding and taking money out of the [[pension fund]] to balance the [[general fund]]. Upon Giordano's arrest in 2001, he was forced to step aside, leaving President of the Board of Aldermen [[Sam Caligiuri]] as acting mayor.

==U.S. Senate race==
In 2000, Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] was chosen by Democratic presidential nominee [[Al Gore]] to be his Vice Presidential running mate -- and Lieberman also chose to run for a third term to the Senate (Connecticut law permits candidates running for both offices). Having little chance to defeat the very popular centrist Lieberman, few Connecticut Republicans wanted to take him on. Finally, the state GOP settled on Giordano. Lieberman focused on his Vice Presidential run and refused to show up at debates; Giordano, mostly ignored by the press, received some coverage by debating alone and mocking Lieberman. In the end, it mattered little, as voters returned the incumbent to the Senate by a nearly two-to-one margin (63% to 34%).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12957">'''Prometa''' is a treatment protocol used primarily for [[methamphetamine]] addiction, although it has also been claimed to be effective for [[Physical dependence|dependence]] on [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or [[cocaine]].&lt;ref name="60 Minutes"&gt;{{cite news |date=December 9, 2007 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/12/07/60minutes/main3590535.shtml.  |title=Prescription For Addiction |work=60 Minutes |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now being labeled as GABASYNC. The treatment, based loosely on the research of Spanish psychologist Juan Jose Legarda, involves a combination of three medications as well as therapy. The medications are each individually approved by the FDA, however none of which have been approved for addiction treatment by the FDA &lt;ref&gt;Prometa Founder's Spotty Background Explored, November 3, 2006, http://www.drugfree.org/join-together/prometa-founders-spotty-background-explored/&lt;/ref&gt;&gt; further the combination has not received any FDA approval. The medications are Gabapentin, Flumazenil and hydroxyzine, used off label. Prometa was developed by Terren Peizer a former junk bond trader  &lt;ref&gt;Prescription For Addiction, 60 Minutes' Scott Pelley Reports On A New Addiction Treatment, Dec. 07, 2007, http://www.cbsnews.com/news/prescription-for-addiction/&lt;/ref&gt; the company name'''Hythiam''', Inc., which has sought to patent the protocol and charges up to $15,000 per patient to license its use. Lower rates are offered to the criminal justice system, where it has been used in several [[drug court]] pilot programs.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roan |first=Shari |title=Addiction treatment, novel but unproved; Prometa's promoters point to anecdotal success. But critics want to see hard numbers |work=Los Angeles Times |page=F1 |date=October 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found the prometa protocol to be no more effective than a placebo in regards to rates of recovery and reduction in craving.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ling | first1 = W. | last2 = Shoptaw | first2 = S. | last3 = Hillhouse | first3 = M. | last4 = Bholat | first4 = M.

A November, 2011, double-blind, placebo-controlled study published in the journal Addiction concluded that Prometa is ineffective. "The PROMETA protocol, consisting of flumazenil, gabapentin and hydroxyzine, appears to be no more effective than placebo in reducing methamphetamine use, retaining patients in treatment or reducing methamphetamine craving." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.addictionjournal.org/viewpressrelease.asp?pr=162{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment steps==
For alcohol dependence, the treatment consists of [[flumazenil]] (administered intravenously),  [[hydroxyzine]], and [[gabapentin]].  The treatment is similar for stimulant dependence, with additional  flumazenil administrations. The dosing regimen of the drug combination is discussed in Urschel’s recently published study.   The initial intravenous administrations are followed up by orally prescribed medications and behavioral treatment.&lt;ref name="urschel"&gt;[http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/content/82/10/1170.full  Urschel HC 3rd, Hanselka LL, Gromov I, White L, Baron M. Open-label study of a proprietary treatment program targeting type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor dysregulation in methamphetamine dependence.]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controlled studies ==
Preliminary evidence that a regimen combining hydroxizine, flumazenil and gabapentin - i.e. the active pharmacological components of Prometa - can help decrease methamphetamine cravings and use was first published in October 2007 following a relatively small, [[open-label trial]] by Dr. Harold C. Urschel. The study, funded by Hythiam, was published in the ''Mayo Clinic Proceedings'', a peer reviewed medical journal.&lt;ref name="urschel" /&gt;

''60 Minutes'' reported that Dr. Urschel's addiction clinic sold the Prometa treatment. However Urschel denied this was a [[conflict of interest]].&lt;ref name="60 Minutes" /&gt;

Dr. Urschel has also completed a double-blind, placebo controlled study of Prometa's active ingredients, where 68 patients were randomized to active and 67 patients to placebo treatment for 30 days. The study reported a decrease in both cravings and methamphetamine use following the initial treatment and throughout the 30 days treatment period.&lt;ref name="urschel2"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19939864 | doi=10.1177/0269881109349837 | volume=25 | title=A controlled trial of flumazenil and gabapentin for initial treatment of methylamphetamine dependence | date=February 2011 | journal=J.

The effects of the flumazenil/gabapentin combination in the treatment of alcohol dependence are less clear. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial alcohol-dependent subjects taking flumazenil/gabapentin had more abstinent days and time to first heavy drinking if they had high alcohol withdrawal symptoms prior to treatment, whereas the patients with low withdrawal symptoms actually did worse with active treatment.&lt;ref name="anton"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19593171 | doi=10.1097/JCP.0b013e3181aba6a4 | volume=29 | title=Efficacy of a combination of flumazenil and gabapentin in the treatment of alcohol dependence: relationship to alcohol withdrawal symptoms | date=August 2009 | journal=J Clin Psychopharmacol | pages=334–42 | last1 = Anton | first1 = RF | last2 = Myrick | first2 = H | last3 = Baros | first3 = AM | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pilot programs==
A Hythiam press release in 2004 announced that a center in [[Covington, Louisiana]], would offer the treatment that was to become known as Prometa in that court's drug program. However, the program was never implemented, and the judge there said he was uncomfortable that the evidence for it was not as strong as the company's marketing. As a result, the first Prometa [[pilot program|pilot]] took place in [[Gary, Indiana]], beginning in November 2005. Hythiam provided a $90,000 grant(according to Karen Freeman-Wilson on a radio show with Gary's 1370am http://www.ustream.tv/channel/wlth-talk on 4/22/11) to cover the program, and court officials spoke positively of the results, but were unable to secure funding to continue it after the grant ran out. Another trial in [[Fulton County, Georgia]], ended early because it was not deemed effective; one report mentioned physician misconduct, but court officials would not comment about the issue.&lt;ref name="Robinson 1"&gt;{{cite news |date=December 23, 2007 |last=Robinson |first=Sean |title=Data show mixed value of Prometa |work=The News Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierce County, Washington]], initiated a 40-person pilot program in 2006 through a nonprofit treatment center serving the county's drug court, and officials reported very promising results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=July 9, 2006 |last=Clarridge |first=Christine |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003114981_drugtreatment09m.html |title=Pilot program helps ease drug addictions |work=Seattle Times |accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this they were able to get $900,000 for Prometa funding in the state and county budgets for 2007, including a [[University of Washington]] study to evaluate the treatment. However, it was subsequently revealed that county executive [[John Ladenburg]], state legislator Dennis Flannigan, and officials at the treatment center had bought Hythiam stock.&lt;ref name="60 Minutes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Otto 1"&gt;{{cite news |date=October 24, 2007 |last=Otto |first=M. Alexander |title=Local officials owned stock in company |work=The News Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; A county audit also questioned the effectiveness of the program, in part because auditors took a different approach than the treatment center in determining whether Prometa was successful.&lt;ref name="Robinson 2"&gt;{{cite news |date=November 11, 2007 |last=Robinson |first=Sean |title=Success or failure? Probing Prometa |work=The News Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These revelations led the Pierce County Council to suspend its funding for the program in October 2007.&lt;ref name="Otto 2"&gt;{{cite news |date=October 24, 2007 |last=Otto |first=M. Alexander |title=Council cuts off drug program |work=The News Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; An unspent $175,000, along with $400,000 Ladenburg had requested for 2008, were instead set aside with the proviso that they could be used for "evidence-based programs that are directed towards breaking the cycle of drug addiction".&lt;ref name="Wickert 1"&gt;{{cite news |date=November 21, 2007 |last=Wickert |first=David |title=Council rejects Prometa funding request |work=The News Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ladenburg and Flannigan also had to amend their state financial disclosure forms, although Ladenburg reported he had sold his stock at a loss and insisted it did not influence his actions.&lt;ref name="Wickert 2"&gt;{{cite news |date=November 6, 2007 |last=Wickert |first=David |title=Politicians revise stock disclosures |work=The News Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; The news from Pierce County, along with a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' investigation of Prometa that aired in December, battered Hythiam's stock, as it fell in value nearly two-thirds by the end of the year.&lt;ref name="Robinson 1" /&gt; However, at the same time the city council in nearby [[Federal Way, Washington]], approved a small $20,000 Prometa trial at the suggestion of a city council member whose employee, one of Prometa's successes, had been treated in Pierce County and featured in the ''60 Minutes'' report.&lt;ref name="Maynard"&gt;{{cite news |date=November 22, 2007 |last=Maynard |first=Steve |title=In Federal Way, Prometa gets council support |work=The News Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, Jerry Madden, chair of the Texas House Corrections Committee, secured $2 million of funding over two years in the state budget for Prometa treatment programs. In contrast with officials in Washington, Madden said he had no financial ties to Hythiam. In support of the budget request he cited a 20-person pilot paid for by Hythiam in [[Collin County, Texas|Collin County]], where the local judge reported a "spectacular" success rate. Other courts in the state were more skeptical about the lack of clinical research supporting Prometa, however, and only four other counties requested funding. About half of the amount budgeted for the initial year was spent.&lt;ref name="Dallas"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ramshaw |first=Emily |title=Texas' Prometa program for treating meth addicts draws skeptics |work=Dallas Morning News |date=January 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture connections==
Troubled actress [[Lindsay Lohan]] was connected to Prometa as one of her rehab efforts during 2007, when ''[[Star (magazine)|Star Magazine]]'' reported that she was being treated by Dr. Matthew Torrington, director of the Prometa Center in Santa Monica.&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;{{cite news |date=October 24, 2007 |url=http://www.starmagazine.com/news/13188 |title=Lindsay's Shocking Drug Therapy |work=Star Magazine |accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prometa was also featured in an episode of the [[MTV]] series ''[[True Life]]'', in which recovering methamphetamine addict "Dustin" allowed the network to film his treatment with Prometa, as well as his life before and after he quit using the drug.&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite web |date=December 6, 2007 |url=http://think.mtv.com/044FDFFFF0002D79C00170098BF0A/ |title=I'm Going to Rehab |work=True Life |publisher=MTV |format=video |accessdate=2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prooftexting''' (sometimes "proof-texting" or "proof texting") is the practice of using isolated, [[Fallacy of quoting out of context|out-of-context]] quotations from a document to establish a proposition in [[eisegesis]]  (introducing one's own presuppositions, agendas, or biases). Such quotes may not accurately reflect the original intent of the author,&lt;ref&gt;"The Use of a Doctrinal Catechism in Sunday-School Instruction: A Symposium", Jesse L.

This is to be distinguished from quotations from a source deemed a [[hostile witness]], which inadvertently substantiate a point beneficial to the quoter in the course of its own narrative. Even when lifted out of context, those facts still stand.

'''Rent control in the United States''' refers to laws or ordinances that set [[price control]]s on the [[renting]] of American residential [[Apartment|housing]]. They function as a [[price ceiling]].{{ r | GPG }}

The loose term "rent control" can apply to several types of price control:
* "strict price ceilings", also known as "'''rent freeze'''" systems, or "'''absolute'''" or "'''first generation'''" rent controls, in which no increases in rent are allowed at all (rent is typically frozen at the rate existing when the law was enacted) 
* "vacancy control", also known as "'''strict'''" or "'''strong'''" rent control, in which the rental price can rise, but continues to be regulated in between tenancies (a new [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] pays almost the same rent as the previous tenant) and 
* "vacancy decontrol", also known as "'''tenancy'''" or "'''second-generation'''" rent control, which limits price increases during a tenancy, but allows rents to rise to market rate between tenancies (new tenants pay market rate rent, but increases are limited as long as they remain).{{ r | GPG }}

As of 2018, four states ([[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Maryland]]) and the [[District of Columbia]] have localities in which some form of residential rent control is in effect (for normal structures, excluding [[Mobile home|mobile homes]]).{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}  Thirty-seven states either prohibit or preempt rent control, while nine states allow their cities to enact rent control, but have no cities that have implemented it.{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}

==History==
In the [[United States]] during [[World War I]], rents were "controlled" through a combination of public pressure and the efforts of local anti-rent-profiteering committees. Between 1919 and 1924, a number of cities and states adopted rent- and eviction-control laws.  Modern rent controls were first adopted in response to [[World War II|WWII]]-era shortages, or following [[Richard Nixon]]'s 1971 wage and price controls.  They remain in effect or have been reintroduced in some cities with large [[leasehold estate|tenant]] populations, such as [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Oakland, California]]. Many smaller communities also have rent control — notably the [[California]] cities of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], and [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]]&lt;ref name="dca.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/appendix2.shtml|title=Landlord/Tenant Book - California Department of Consumer Affairs|first=Department of Consumer Affairs, State of|last=California|website=www.dca.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; — along with many small towns in [[New Jersey]]. In the early 1990s, rent control in some cities, such as [[Boston]] and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], was ended by state [[referendum|referenda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |vauthors= |title=Massachusetts Election Statistics 1994: Ballot Question #9 |year= 1994|publisher= [Boston?] : The Division|quote= | url=https://archive.org/stream/massachusettsele1994mass#page/522/mode/2up |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===

[[New York State]] has had the longest [[Rent control in New York|history of rent controls]], since 1943. New York City contains the majority of units covered by rent control. Rent control laws have stayed on the books for decades in New York because of an inadequate supply of "decent, affordable housing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tenant.net/Oversight/50yrRentReg/history.html|title=History of Rent Regulation|website=www.tenant.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worsening in the rental market led to the enactment of the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969, which aimed to help increase the number of available rental units. The current system is very complicated, and most of the protected renters are elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metcouncil.net/factsheets/rentcontrol.htm|title=Rent Control Fact Sheet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===

In California, municipal enactment of rent controls followed the high [[inflation]] of the 1970s (causing rents to continually rise){{ r | Birth_of_RC_in_SF | p=1 | q=Inflation averaged 8 percent in the Bay Area during the 1970s; renters were forced to pay rents that were changing monthly as the dollar devalued and the demand for hard assets, especially real estate, grew. Deinstfrey called it mailbox roulette, for tenants never knew what kind of huge rent increase might be waiting for them in the mail. }} and the 1979 statewide [[Proposition 13]], which set [[property tax]] rates at 1%, and capped yearly increases at 2%. Leading the campaign to enact Proposition 13, California politician [[Howard Jarvis]] tried to get tenants to vote for Prop 13 by claiming that landlords would pass tax savings along to tenants; when most failed to do so, it became an additional motivating factor for rent control.{{ r | Birth_of_RC_in_SF | p=2 | q=Proposition 13 threw fuel on the fire. One of Howard Jarvis&amp;apos; arguments for rolling back and rapidly freezing escalating property taxes (an inflation-induced mess, too) was that the savings would be passed onto tenants. Although several large San Francisco property owners passed Proposition 13 savings on to some 7,000 tenants, most landlords did not. In jurisdictions with large tenant populations like San Francisco, the empty promises became a rallying cry for activists. }} 

In 1985, California adopted the [[Ellis Act]], eliminating municipalities' ability to prohibit the removal of properties from rental activities after the [[California Supreme Court]] in ''Nash v. City of Santa Monica''&lt;ref name=Nash_v_CoSM &gt; {{ cite web | url=https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/37/97.html | doi= | title=Nash v. City of Santa Monica (1984) | last= | first= | publisher=[[Justia]] | date=1984-10-25 | accessdate=2018-08-05 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202083614/https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/37/97.html | archive-date=2015-12-02 | dead-url=no }} &lt;/ref&gt; ruled that municipalities could prevent landlords from "going out of business" and withdrawing their properties from the rental market.[http://www.beyondchron.org/news/index.php?itemid=1265]

"Strong" or "vacancy control" rent control laws were in effect in five California cities ([[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[East Palo Alto, California|East Palo Alto]] and [[Cotati, California|Cotati]]) in 1995, when AB 1164 (known as the [[Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act]]) preempted some elements of municipal rent control ordinances and completely eliminated strong rent-control in California (except in special cases like [[Trailer park|mobile home parks]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/95-96/bill/asm/ab_1151-1200/ab_1164_bill_950804_chaptered.html | title=AB1164 Bill Text | accessdate=2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a statewide [[initiative]] (Proposition 10) attempted to repeal the Costa-Hawkins law, which, if passed, would have allowed cities and municipalities to enact "strong" or "vacancy control" systems, allowed rent control to be applied to buildings newer than 1995, and would have allowed rent control on single-family homes. (All currently prohibited by Costa-Hawkins.){{ r | SJMN_RC_failed | p=1 | q=Prop. 10 took aim at a decades-old state law that prohibits cities from enforcing certain types of rent control. Without that law, cities would have had the power to place price caps on rented single family homes, condominiums and apartment buildings constructed after 1995 — or in the case of cities with older rent-control policies, such as Oakland and San Francisco, apartments built after the late 1970s or early 1980s. Under current state law, those units cannot be subject to rent control. ... In addition to expanding the types of properties that would fall under rent control, Prop. 10 would have let cities permanently cap the price of an apartment, allowing only modest increases even after tenants move out. That policy, known as vacancy control, was used decades ago in a handful of cities including Berkeley, East Palo Alto and Santa Monica before California passed the Costa-Hawkins law banning it. Currently, landlords can raise prices to market rates after a tenant in a rent-controlled unit leaves. Vacancy control would have immediately taken effect in Berkeley if Prop. 10 passed, as it has remained on the books, unenforced, for more than two decades. }} The proposition failed, 62% to 38%.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Dillon, [http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-hold-proposition-10-rent-control-1541029296-htmlstory.html "California voters reject Prop. 10"], ''Los Angeles Times'', November 6, 2018. Accessed 2018-11-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[Costa–Hawkins_Rental_Housing_Act#By_initiative:_Prop_10|Proposition 10]]

===Mobile homes===

In some regions, rent control laws are more commonly adopted for [[mobile home]] parks.  Reasons given for these laws include residents owning their homes while renting the land the home sits on, the high cost of moving mobile homes, and the loss of home value when they are moved. California, for example, has only 13 local apartment rent control laws but over 100 local mobile home rent control laws.{{citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=Statements are very likely true, but need references to back up the numbers. }}  No new mobile home parks have been built in California since 1991.{{citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=Statements may be true, but need references to prove the claims, and a reference to prove that the non-building of mobile home parks is BECAUSE OF rent control; otherwise this statement is irrelevant to this article. }}

==Law==
Rent control laws define which rental units are affected, and may only cover larger complexes, or units older than a certain date. To attempt to not disincentivise investment in new housing stock, rent control laws often exempt new construction.  For example, San Francisco's Rent Stabilization Ordinance exempts all units built after 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/rentboard_page.asp?id=54501|title=San Francisco Rent Board: Fact Sheet 1 – General Information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York State]] generally exempts units built after 1974 anywhere in the state (although owners can agree to rent stabilization in exchange for tax benefits).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dhcr.state.ny.us/ora/pubs/html/orafac1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

The frequency and degree of rent increases are limited, usually to the rate of inflation defined by the [[Consumer Price Index]] or to a fraction thereof. San Francisco, for example, allows annual rent increases of 60% of the CPI, up to a maximum 7%.&lt;ref&gt;

Rent control laws are often administered by nonelected rent control boards. Officers in city government assign members of the board, which will ensure mixed numbers of tenants and property owners to balance out their benefits. As stated in Goodman's research, a typical rent control board in New York is structured by two tenants, two landlords, and one homeowner.(Gilderbloom &amp; Markham,1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9906.1996.tb00388.x|title=Moderate Rent Control: Sixty Cities over 20 Years|journal=Journal of Urban Affairs|volume=18|issue=4|pages=409–430|year=2016|last1=Gilderbloom|first1=John I.|last2=Markham|first2=John P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal law===
Rent regulation in the [[United States]] is an issue for each state. In 1921, the [[US supreme court|US Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Block v. Hirsh]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|256|135|1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; held by a majority that regulation of rents in the District of Columbia as a temporary emergency measure was constitutional, but shortly afterwards in 1924 in ''[[Chastleton Corp v. Sinclair]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|264|543|1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same law was unanimously struck down by the Supreme Court.  After the 1930s [[New Deal]], the Supreme Court ceased to interfere with social and economic legislation, and a growing number of states adopted rules.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The application was often inconsistent. For example, in [[New York City]], almost half of property units continue to have the protection of rent regulation, while other units on the private market are left to be priced according to what the market will bear.&lt;ref name="SB"&gt; {{ cite web | last=Beyer | first=Scott | date=April 24, 2015 | title=How Ironic: America's Rent-Controlled Cities Are Its Least Affordable | publisher=''[[Forbes]]'' | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2015/04/24/how-ironic-americas-rent-controlled-cities-are-its-least-affordable/ |accessdate=12 June 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501001409/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2015/04/24/how-ironic-americas-rent-controlled-cities-are-its-least-affordable/ | archive-date=2015-05-01 | dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1986 case of ''[[Fisher v. City of Berkeley]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|475|260|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the US Supreme court held that there was no incompatibility between rent control and the [[Sherman Act]].

===State law===
As of 2018, four states ([[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Maryland]]) and the [[District of Columbia]] have localities in which some form of residential rent control is in effect (for normal structures, excluding [[Mobile home|mobile homes]]).{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}  Thirty-seven states either prohibit or preempt rent control, while nine states allow their cities to enact rent control, but have no cities that have implemented it.{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}

==Arguments for==

===Economic===
The rental-accommodation market suffers from [[asymmetrical information|information asymmetries]] and high [[transaction costs]]. Typically, a landlord has more information about a home than a prospective tenant can reasonably detect. Moreover, once the tenant has moved in, the costs of moving again are very high.  Unscrupulous landlords could conceal defects and, if the tenant complains, threaten to raise the rent at the end of the [[lease]]. With rent control, tenants can request that hidden defects, if they exist, be repaired to comply with [[building code]] requirements, without fearing retaliatory rent increases. Rent control could thus compensate somewhat for inefficiencies of the housing market.{{ r | GPG | p=1 | q=Another justification is to correct market inefficiencies such as information asymmetry and high transaction costs. Because of the high cost of moving, tenants can arguably be pressured by landlords to accept rent increases. Tenants may also be unaware of the real condition of units until they move in. If the tenant complains, the landlord may threaten to increase the rent. }} &lt;ref name=R_vU-S &gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0166-0462(01)00093-X |title=A model of regulation in the rental housing market |journal=Regional Science and Urban Economics |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=475–500 |year=2002 |last1=Raess |first1=Pascal |last2=von Ungern-Sternberg |first2=Thomas }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In older buildings, rent control may broaden incentives to renovate individual units: tenants may invest [[sweat equity]] and their own money to improve their homes if they are protected from landlords trying to capture the added value,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Kx8-Lz5K1YYC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=%22sweat+equity%22+%22rent+control%22 | title = Community versus Commodity: Tenants and the American City | isbn = 9780791498439 | author1 = Čapek | first1 = Stella M | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LMLT_history &gt; {{ cite web | url=http://www.lmlt.org/lmlt1.html | doi= | title=Background history | last= | first= | publisher=Lower Manhattan Loft Tenants | date=2002-01-01 | accessdate= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629051939/http://www.lmlt.org/lmlt1.html | archive-date=2012-06-29 | dead-url=yes | pages= | quote=As early as the mid-1960s, artists began pioneering the economically-depressed manufacturing zone of lower Manhattan known as SoHo where they found affordable "raw" or "as is" spaces large enough to both live and work (ie: lofts). Delighted to receive rent for these often abandoned, derelict spaces, commercial property owners welcomed and encouraged the residential occupancy of their buildings. Using sweat equity, artists renovated their leased lofts converting them into habitable living/working studios, installing plumbing and electrical fixtures along with other improvements--generally at their own expense. The City, which was equally delighted by the stabilization of the property tax base, turned a blind eye to the fact that none of these buildings had a residential Certificate of Occupancy. }} &lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=August 2018|reason=The second source does not support the statement; these tenants improved their units even though they had no rent-control; technically they were living there illegally. }} while vacancy decontrol preserves landlords' financial incentive to renovate vacant units because it allows them to re-rent at market value.

===Moral===

Tenants' rights activists argue that rent control is necessary in times of long term housing shortages (See [[California housing shortage]]) to reduce the human suffering caused by increasing rents and the homelessness which results when people who can no longer afford the rent increases get evicted.{{r | SD_RC_Tenant_Union | p=1 | q=... the projections show that even building at maximum capacity, the county will not be able to catch up and there will still be a 152,000-housing-unit shortage in 2050. ... Unless San Diego gets rent control, greedy landlords and government officials will be directly responsible for the rampant creation of homelessness and increased worker suffering. }}

==Arguments against==
Writing in 1946, economists [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George J. Stigler]] said: "Rent ceilings, therefore, cause haphazard and arbitrary allocation of space, inefficient use of space, retardation of new construction and indefinite continuance of rent ceilings, or subsidization of new construction and a future depression in residential building."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fee.org/library/books/roofs-or-ceilings-the-current-housing-problem/|title=Roofs or Ceilings? The Current Housing Problem - Milton D. Friedman|first=Milton D.|last=Friedman|date=21 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although those paying lower than market rent are "protected," most economists argue that newer residents actually pay higher rent due to reduced supply.

===Economic===
In a 1992 [[Stratified sampling|stratified]], random survey of 464 US economists, economics [[graduate school|graduate students]], and members of the [[American Economic Association]], 93% "generally agreed" or "agreed with [[wikt:proviso|provisos]]" that "A ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available."{{ r | 1992_poll | p=204 | q=76.3% generally agreed, 16.6% agreed but with provisos }} {{ r | Krugman_NYT | p=1 | q=The analysis of rent control is among the best-understood issues in all of economics, and -- among economists, anyway -- one of the least controversial.

A 2009 review of the economic literature{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review | p=106 | q=If rent-control is such a “no-brainer,” why bother to scrutinize the literature? The cluster of restrictions persists in roughly 140 jurisdictions in the United States as of 2001. As Hazlett (1982) notes, “economists have been notoriously thorough in convincing themselves of the destructive effects of rent control and notoriously inept at convincing anyone else” (278). Better understanding of the issue might help correct the error, prevent other governments from falling into it, and promote an understanding among more than just economists. Also, better understanding is an end in itself. }} by Blair Jenkins through [[EconLit]] covering theoretical and empirical research on multiple aspects of the issue, including housing availability, maintenance and housing quality, rental rates, political and administrative costs, and redistribution, for both first generation and second generation rent control systems, found that “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves”.{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review | p=105 | q=My review of the rent-control literature indexed by EconLit (or cited by such indexed articles) finds that economic research quite consistently and predominantly frowns on rent control. ...

The upshot is that, at best, rent control does little harm but probably not much good and, at worst, it has negative impacts on landlords and tenants.  There is near universal agreement that strict price ceilings, such as the kind imposed in New York City in the 1940s, are always bad because they severely inhibit housing production and investment. Even those most sympathetic to rent control seem to agree with this. }} {{ r | Forbes_RC_cities | p=1 | q=Bad ideas die hard, and rent control is no exception.

What, then, should be done to help renters obtain affordable, decent housing? A better approach may be adopting policies that encourage the production of more diverse types of housing (different densities, tenure types, unit sizes, etc.), implementing strong regulations and practices to ensure housing quality and to protect tenants from abuses; and providing targeted, direct subsidies to people who need help paying their rents. }} {{ r | SFChronicle_RC_1 | p=1 | q=In 2013, Peter Tatian of the Urban Institute reviewed academic research on rent control and found “very little evidence that rent control is a good policy.” }} {{ r | CityLab_RC_NYC | p=1 | q=Then again, as Peter Tatian of the Urban Institute recently wrote here, [the author hyperlinks to the Peter Tatian analysis on the words "recently wrote here"] there&amp;apos;s "very little evidence that rent control is good policy."

Two economists from opposing sides of the political spectrum, [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Paul Krugman]] (who identifies as an American liberal or European [[social democrat]]),&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR1FpbMkZ58 "Nobelpristagaren i ekonomi 2008: Paul Krugman"], speech by Paul Krugman (Retrieved December 26, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Sowell]], (who stated that "[[Libertarianism|libertarian]]" might best describe his views){{ r | Sowell_Salon | p=1 | q=What would your preferred label be? I prefer not to have labels, but I suspect that "libertarian" would suit me better than many others, }} have both criticized rent regulation as poor economics, which, despite its good intentions, leads to the creation of less housing, raises prices, and increases [[urban blight]].{{ r | Krugman_NYT | p=1 | q=Sky-high rents on uncontrolled apartments, because desperate renters have nowhere to go -- and the absence of new apartment construction, despite those high rents, because landlords fear that controls will be extended? Predictable. }} {{ r | Sowell_EF&amp;F | p=4 | q=Rent control, for example, has been imposed in various cities around the world, with the intention of helping tenants. Almost invariably, landlords and builders of housing find the reduced range of terms less acceptable and therefore supply less housing. ... In other words, while landlords and builders simply lost an opportunity to make as much money as they could have otherwise, many tenants lost an opportunity to find a decent place to live. }} {{ r | Sowell_Salon | p=1 | q=You aren&amp;apos;t a fan of rent control? No, I&amp;apos;m not. A figure I ran across recently that struck me as illustrating the moral bankruptcy of rent control is this: The number of boarded-up housing units in New York City is four times the number of homeless people on the streets. To think of that! On winter nights there are people sleeping on the cold pavement and dying of exposure, when there are these buildings that are boarded up as a consequence of economic protectionism. }}

Price ceilings can create [[shortages]] and reduce quality when they are less than the [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium price]].  By capping the price of housing, rent control can increase [[Supply and demand|demand]] and reduce available [[Supply and demand|supply]], causing a shortage.&lt;ref name=mankiw&gt;Mankiw, Gregory. Principles of Economics. 4th ed. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Irrelevant citation|date=October 2018}}  It is argued that rent control also reduces the quality of available housing, deters investment, and raises rents on tenants who are excluded from its protections (for example, in jurisdictions with vacancy decontrol, tenants who move or arrive later).{{Verify source|date=September 2011}}  When property owners are restricted in the rents they can charge, they are less willing to construct more housing (a form of [[capital strike]]).{{ r | SJMN_RC_new_housing | p=1 | q=David Shulman, an economist and expert on California housing, agreed that housing trends in California follow economic cycles, but said there could be trouble on the horizon should voters clear the way for strong rent control, he said. “All the rent control laws that passed previously always exempted new construction, even Berkeley and Santa Monica. Therefore it’s credible to say that housing construction would continue under rent control,” Shulman said. “Until now.” Shulman said repeal of Costa-Hawkins could send a message to developers that California is an unpredictable place to do business, and that could have an unprecedented chilling effect on development of new apartments. “That’s a legitimate fear,” Shulman said. “Cities could go back and change their laws anytime they want… This could lead to a collapse of new apartment construction.”}}  Since supply is low, landlords worry less about tenants leaving and have little incentive to maintain the property.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  For example, unless owners can reasonably expect that [[punitive]] action will be taken against them, they might let building maintenance deteriorate in order to mitigate the lower rental income.{{Verify source|date=September 2011}} People moving into the city have difficulty finding housing because of the shortage created by rent control.&lt;ref name=Krugman&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Krugman  | first = Paul  | title =  Reckonings; A Rent Affair  | newspaper = The New York Times  | date = June 7, 2000  | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E4DF153FF934A35755C0A9669C8B63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When housing is limited, it must be rationed in some way. After the [[San Francisco earthquake of 1906]], the number of houses relative to the number of people who needed housing fell by 40%, but a shortage was avoided because the market price mechanism effectively rationed housing and provided an incentive for new housing to be built. In 1946, however, a far less extreme situation was dealt with via chance and favoritehood.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Social===
Some, such as William Tucker of the [[Cato Institute]], a leading [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[thinktank]],&lt;ref name=Cato&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Tucker  | first = William  | title = How Rent Control Drives Out Affordable Housing  | journal = Cato Policy Analysis  | issue = 274  | date = May 21, 1997  | url = https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa274.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that rent control laws are a textbook example of the problems that arise in trying to artificially reduce prices. The natural consequence in a [[free-market]] economy is a reduction in supply and consequent shortages. Tucker has argued that rent control has the perverse effect of creating ''less'' affordable housing.&lt;ref name=Cato/&gt;

Areas with rent-controlled housing are blamed for difficulty of finding vacant housing and the resulting power imbalance between landlords and tenants as tenants may "game the system" to impose onerous conditions on the landlord, forcing long cycles of judicial action, leading to considerable economic hardship for the landlord.  Likewise, new tenants have serious difficulty finding housing, so they are seriously disadvantaged if they must move. As a result, landlords can impose numerous conditions and requirements.&lt;ref name=Krugman/&gt;

===Moral===
Rent control restricts the [[property right]]s of property owners,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; as it limits what they may do with their property, requiring petitioning and other processes by law, prior to taking action against a renter.

Because enacting rent control on a building reduces the investment return that can be expected from that building, it thereby reduces the present value of the building, which can be viewed as a partial [[expropriation]] of private property.&lt;ref&gt;"By enacting rent control legislation and thereby restricting investors in future rentals, a city may actively reduce the present value of a property. This is essentially community expropriation in favor of tenants." "The Cities' Wealth", an influential activist tract quoted in Collier, Peter and David Horowoitz, 1996.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9348">[[File:April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month.png|thumb|April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month]]
'''Sexual Assault Awareness Month''' ('''SAAM''') is an annual campaign to raise public awareness about [[sexual assault]] and educate communities and individuals on how to prevent [[sexual violence]].&lt;ref name="whitehouse1"&gt;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/presidential-proclamation-national-sexual-assault-awareness-month&lt;/ref&gt; It is observed in April.

Each year during the month of April, state, territory, tribal and community-based organizations, [[rape crisis centers]], government agencies, businesses, campuses and individuals plan events and activities to highlight sexual violence as a public health, human rights and social justice issue and reinforce the need for prevention efforts.

The theme, slogan, resources and materials for the national SAAM campaign are coordinated by the [[National Sexual Violence Resource Center]] each year with assistance from anti-sexual assault organizations throughout the United States.

== History ==
The 1970s saw a significant growth for prevention and awareness of sexual violence across the country, following the general trend of social activism throughout the decade. Moving beyond awareness of the issue, the Bay Area Women Against Rape opened in 1971 as the nation’s first rape crisis center offering immediate victim services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bawar.org/about/|title=About – BAWAR|website=www.bawar.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this heightened awareness of sexual violence, state coalitions began to form, beginning with [[Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcar.org/about-us/about-pcar|title=About PCAR {{!}} Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape (PCAR)|website=www.pcar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As early as 1976, [[Take Back the Night (protest)|Take Back the Night]] marches rallied women in organized protest against [[rape]] and sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.takebackthenight.org/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; These marches protested the violence and fear that women encountered walking the streets at night. Over time these events coordinated into a movement across the United States and Europe. Because of this movement broader activities to raise awareness of [[violence against women]] began to occur.

In the early 1980s, activists used October to raise awareness of violence against women and [[domestic violence]] awareness became the main focus. In the late 1980s, the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault (NCASA) informally polled state sexual assault coalitions to determine the preferred date for a national Sexual Assault Awareness Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsvrc.org/saam/what-is-saam/history|title=SAAM History|work=nsvrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week in April was selected. By the late 1990s, many advocates began coordinating activities and events throughout the month of April, advancing the idea of a nationally recognized month for sexual violence awareness and prevention activities. SAAM was first observed nationally in April 2001.

Survivors, advocates, and state coalitions mobilized around the creation and implementation of the [[Violence Against Women Act]] in 1994. This bill was the first national law requiring law enforcement to treat gender violence as a crime rather than a private family matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legalmomentum.org/history-vawa|title=History of VAWA {{!}} Legal Momentum|website=www.legalmomentum.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; VAWA was also designed to strengthen legal protections for victims of domestic violence and sexual violence as well as expand services to survivors and their children

The [[National Sexual Violence Resource Center]] was established in 2000 by the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape and the Center for Disease Control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsvrc.org/about/national-sexual-violence-resource-center|title=About the National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC)|website=www.nsvrc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the NSVRC coordinated the first formally recognized national Sexual Assault Awareness Month campaign, and still facilitates it today. In 2005, the campaign shifted to prevention of sexual violence and the first tool kits were sent out to coalitions and rape crisis centers across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsvrc.org/saam/history|title=History of Sexual Assault Awareness Month {{!}} National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC)|website=www.nsvrc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awareness for the campaign culminated in 2009 when Barack Obama was the first president to officially proclaim April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85979|title=Barack Obama: Proclamation 8359—National Sexual Assault Awareness Month, 2009|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color and symbol ==
State, territory, and tribal sexual violence coalitions were polled in 2000 by the Resource Sharing Project (RSP) and the NSVRC to determine that the color [[teal]] was the preferred color for sexual assault awareness and prevention and that April was the preferred month to coordinate national sexual assault awareness activities. The [[List of awareness ribbons|teal ribbon]] was adopted as a symbol of sexual assault awareness and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsvrc.org/saam/what-is-saam/symbol-and-color|title=SAAM Graphics|work=nsvrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities and Events ==

=== Day of Action ===

The first Tuesday in April is the SAAM [https://www.nsvrc.org/saam/day-of-action Day of Action] and provides an opportunity for everyone to take action in preventing sexual violence.

=== The Clothesline Project ===

Beginning in 1990 in Massachusetts, [[The Clothesline Project]] is made up of t-shirts created by survivors of violence, or created in honor of someone who has experienced violence. The Clothesline Project provides evidence that incest, domestic violence, and sexual violence exists in our communities and is a visual reminder of statistics that we often ignore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clotheslineproject.info/about.html|title=About the Clothesline Project {{!}} Clothesline Project|website=clotheslineproject.info|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Take Back the Night ===

[[Take Back the Night (organization)|Take Back the Night]] is an international event that began in the early 1970s in response to sexual assaults and violence against women. Local communities have organized TBTN marches and rallies to unify individuals against violence in their communities. TBTN can include a candlelight vigil, a rally, a survivor speak out, and a large scale public march. 

=== Walk a Mile in Her Shoes ===

Created in 2001, Walk a Mile in Her Shoes is an international men’s march to stop rape, sexual assault, and gender violence. The event helps to bring community awareness of sexual violence and have everyone involved in the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkamileinhershoes.org/|title=Welcome  {{!}}  Walk a Mile in Her Shoes|website=www.walkamileinhershoes.org|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denim Day ===

Peace Over Violence facilitates a Wednesday in April as [[Denim Day]] as a symbol of protest against misconceptions around sexual assault. The event was originally created in response to an Italian Supreme Court case in which a rape conviction was overruled because the victims tight jeans implied consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://denimdayinfo.org/about/|title=About {{!}} Denim Day|website=denimdayinfo.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== 2018 Campaign Theme ==

This year, SAAM is celebrating its 17th anniversary with the theme [https://www.nsvrc.org/saam Embrace Your Voice] to inform individuals on how they can use their words to promote safety, respect, and equality to stop sexual violence before it happens. More specifically, individuals can embrace their voices to show their support for survivors, stand up to victim blaming, shut down rape jokes, correct harmful misconceptions, promote everyday consent, and practice healthy communications with children. NSVRC has developed four key resources for this campaign including fact-sheets, [https://www.nsvrc.org/embrace-your-voice-sheet Embrace Your Voice], [https://www.nsvrc.org/everyday-consent-sheet Everyday Consent], [https://www.nsvrc.org/healthy-communications-kids-sheet Healthy Communications with Kids], and [https://www.nsvrc.org/understanding-sexual-violence-sheet Understanding Sexual Violence].

==Origin==
'''Sikarwar''' Suryavanshi Rajput — Suryavanshi rajputs trace their lineage to the Vedic Sun – Surya. Lord Rama was also born in this lineage. Suryavanshi rajputs ruled over Mewar, Marwar, Amber, etc. Raghuvanshi Rajput–A Raghav Rajput is a member of one of the major Suryavanshi Rajput clans of India who ruled a number of kingdoms and princely states. Raghav is the oldest Suryavanshi Rajput clan. They enjoy a reputation as rulers and soldiers. The Raghav population and the former Rajput states are found spread through much the subcontinent, particularly in North India and central India. The Raghav are the forefathers of many Suryavanshi Rajput clans such as the Bargurjars, Silkarwar, Sisodiyas, Kachwahas, and Minhass. Their kuldevta (family deity) is Lord Rama and their kuldevi (goddess) is Sita.

''Sikarwar Khanzada'' are [[Suryavanshi Rajput]] converts from Sikarwar [[Rajput]] clan. They claim descent from Kamat Dev Sikarwar, who left Vijaipur Sikri now [[Fatehpur Sikri]], in AD-1527 after the 'Battle of Kanhua' with Babur . Kamat Dev became Karim Khan after conversion and established the [[Dildarnagar Kamsar]] Paragna of [[Dildarnagar]],Zamania in Ghazipur district in his name. Kamat Dev's genealogy descends from Pratap Rao Sikarwar who had constructed the Anup Tal of Sikri in his father's Anup Dev Sikarwar's name. The now shattered Elephant Gate of Sikri was also constructed by Pratap Rao. He had a son Udai Raj Sikarwar and a grandson Parmeshwar Dev Sikarwar. Parmeshwar in turn had three sons namely- Pujian Dev Sikarwar, Niverdhan Dev Sikarwar and Sahaj Dev Sikarwar. Sahaj Dev had a son by the name of Kamat Dev Sikarwar. It was Kamat Dev Sikarwar who was caught and converted by Babur after the 'Battle of Kanhua' along with three of his  sons. Their names were- Puran Mal Sikarwar, Vishnu Dev Sikarwar and Naman Dev Sikarwar. After conversion Puran Mal became Akhram Khan, Vishnu became Ajmat Khan and Naman became Inayat Khan. After conversion Babur even gave Karim Khanji a state to rule in Sikri. Babur knew that if a ruler gets converted it becomes easier to convert the rest of the population. Karim Khan was a Prince of Vijaipur Sikri. Since he had converted under duress he gave away his state. The progeny of Vishnu or Ajmat Khan and Naman or Inayat Khan continues to reside at Sikri and Agra. They seem to call themselves 'Rangers'. The famous Salim Chiste, a contemporary of Akbar also seems to belong to this clan. The progeny of Puran Mal or Akhram Khan shifted to Eastern Uttar Pradesh. His father Karim Khan visited Rao Dham Dev Sikarwar (his Kin) (at Gahanban now Gahmar) during Akbar's rule. Rao Dham Dev Sikarwar was the last ruler of Sikri who fought against Babur.Akhram Khanji could be an ancestor of the Chaudhary family of Allahdadpur of [[Sultanpur District]]. They were at one time substantial landowners of Sultanpur. The Sikarwar Khanzada of [[Zamania]] [[tehsil]] of [[Ghazipur District]] reside in Kamsar Paragna.As per Madam Beveridge the translator of Baburnama, there is a 'Gap' of 15 MONTHS just before Babur's death in 1530 AD. These details if mentioned at all by Babur seem to have been removed from his records. Some Sikarwars of village Samauta also got converted to [[Islam]] during Aurangzeb's period.&lt;ref&gt;A Gazetteer of Ghazipur District Volume XXIX: Gazetteers of the United Provinces  edited by H. R Neville&lt;/ref&gt; Edited by a Sikarwar of Gahmar.&lt;ref name="Neville"/&gt;

==Present circumstances==

''''''Sikarwar Khanzadas'''''' are [[Sunni]] [[Suryavanshi Rajput]]s, who incorporate many folk beliefs. They are mainly small and medium-sized farmers, from Aldamau in [[Sultanpur District]], where they occupy nine villages. They also occupy  a number of villages in [[Dildarnagar Kamsar]] in [[Ghazipur District]]. In addition to the Sikarwar Khanzada, the Sikarwar converts who call themselves [[Ranghar]] in [[Agra District]] also belong to this clan.

Their sense of belonging to the [[Rajput]] community remains strong. The Sikarwar Khanzada strongly identify themselves with the wider [[Rajput]] community of [[Awadh]]. The persistence of their marriages customs, like bursting of crackers and sending specially made [[Laddu|laddoos]] to biradari members are some examples. Many continue to serve the armed forces of [[India]], an activity traditionally associated with Rajputs. The Khanzadas were badly affected after the [[zamindari]] system was abolished. Like other [[Suryavanshi Rajput]]s, there is a movement towards orthodoxy, as many of their villages have started having [[madrasa]]s. These madrasas have facilitated growth of [Hindi]. It seems to replace [[Awadhi]] dialect that they speak traditionally. .&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/times-of-india-the/mi_8012/is_20070708/Suryavanshi Rajput-india/ai_n39451474/?tag=content;col1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Syrian Colombian''' is a Colombian of [[Syria]]n descent or a Syrian naturalized Colombian.

== History ==
The wave of Syrian immigration to Colombia seems to have begun in the 1880s. This was perhaps its peak during the first three decades of this century and declined after 1930, but Syrians, [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Palestinians]] continued since then settled in Colombia. Due to the limited information available, it is impossible to know exactly how many Syrians and Lebanese have immigrated into the country. It has been estimated that, during the busiest period (1880-1930), a figure between 5,000 and 10,000 could be reliable. Whatever the figure, there is no doubt that, perhaps next to the Spanish, the Syrian-Lebanese are the largest immigrant group in Colombia since independence.

Those who left their homeland in the [[Middle East]] to settle in Colombia were motivated by a variety of reasons: economic, political and religious. The selection of Colombia as a destination obeyed on random occasions and once the process starts, the weak information about the country began to receive those who already had family or friends with some experience in the migratory adventure.

The phenomenon of the Syrian-Lebanese immigration in Colombia is far from unique to the Atlantic coast. In his biographical essay on [[Gabriel Turbay]], Gonzalo Buenahora highlighted the contribution of the Syrian economic development [[Bucaramanga]]. Chalelas, Stafis, Korgis, Chedranis, were the trade balance for half a century and their names linked to the steel industry.  The establishment of the first factories of buttons and strings, and the importation of the first car that came by mule to Bucaramanga in 1912 were linked to Sino-Lebanese names. Syrian-Lebanese immigrants, and in significant numbers, were established in other cities in the region of [[Santander, Colombia|Santander]], as [[Ocaña, Colombia|Ocaña]], [[Barrancabermeja]] and [[Cucuta]], as in many other towns in the country other than those of the Atlantic coast: [[Ibagué]], [[Girardot, Cundinamarca|Girardot]], [[Honda, Colombia|Honda]], [[Tunja]], [[Villavicencio]], [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]], [[Soatá]], [[Neiva]], [[Buga, Valle del Cauca|Buga]], [[Chaparral, Tolima|Chaparral]] or [[Chinácota]]. After [[Barranquilla]] and [[Cartagena de Indias]], [[Bogotá]] stood beside [[Cali]], among cities with the largest number of Arabic-speaking representatives in Colombia in 1945. Some of these immigrants had arrived in the country in the 1890s, others arrived early this century, but a high percentage of them arrived during the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/publicacionesbanrep/boletin/boleti5/bol29/tierra3.htm Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8513">[[File:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|[[Everett Rogers|Rogers]]{{'}} [[normal distribution|bell curve]]]]
The '''technology adoption lifecycle''' is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical [[normal distribution]] or "bell curve". The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called "[[innovators]]", followed by "[[early adopters]]". Next come the '''early majority''' and '''late majority''', and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called "Laggards" or "phobics." For example, a phobic may only use a cloud service when it is the only remaining method of performing a required task, but the phobic may not have an in-depth technical knowledge of how to use the service.

The [[demographic]] and [[psychological]] (or "[[psychographic]]") profiles of each adoption group were originally specified by the North Central Rural Sociology Committee, Subcommittee for the Study of the Diffusion of Farm Practices, by agricultural researchers Beal and Bohlen in 1957.&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
The report summarized the categories as:&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
* [[innovators]] – had larger farms, were more educated, more prosperous and more risk-oriented
* [[early adopter]]s – younger, more educated, tended to be community leaders, less prosperous
* early majority – more conservative but open to new ideas, active in community and influence to neighbours
* late majority – older, less educated, fairly conservative and less socially active
* laggards – very conservative, had small farms and capital, oldest and least educated

The model has subsequently been adapted for many areas of technology adoption in the late 20th century.

==Adaptations of the model==
The model has spawned a range of adaptations that extend the concept or apply it to specific domains of interest.

In his book ''[[Crossing the Chasm]]'', [[Geoffrey Moore]] proposes a variation of the original lifecycle. He suggests that for discontinuous innovations, which may result in a Foster disruption based on s-curve, there is a gap or chasm between the first two adopter groups (innovators/early adopters), and the vertical markets.

Disruption as it is used today are of the [[Clayton M. Christensen]] variety. These disruptions are not s-curve based. 

In [[educational technology]], Lindy McKeown has provided a similar model (a pencil metaphor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm Pencil metaphor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128192012/http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm |date=2007-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) describing the [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] uptake in education. In [[medical sociology]], Carl May has proposed [[normalization process theory]] that shows how technologies become embedded and integrated in health care and other kinds of organisation.

Wenger, White and Smith, in their book ''Digital habitats: Stewarding technology for communities'', talk of technology stewards: people with sufficient understanding of the technology available and the technological needs of a community to steward the community through the technology adoption process.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rayna and Striukova (2009) propose that the choice of initial market segment has crucial importance for crossing the chasm, as adoption in this segment can lead to a cascade of adoption in the other segments. This initial market segment has, at the same time, to contain a large proportion of visionaries, to be small enough for adoption to be observed from within the segment and from other segment and be sufficiently connected with other segments. If this is the case, the adoption in the first segment will progressively cascade into the adjacent segments, thereby triggering the adoption by the mass-market.&lt;ref&gt; Rayna, Thierry, Striukova, Ludmila and Landau, Samuel, Crossing the Chasm or Being Crossed Out: The Case of Digital Audio Players (March 7, 2009). International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation, Vol. 1, No. 3, pp. 36-54, July-September 2009. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1392691&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One way to model product adoption&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, Luis. (2008) [http://scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures/lecture04.pdf Science of the Web] lectures at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt; is to understand that people's behaviours are influenced by their peers and how widespread they think a particular action is. For many format-dependent technologies, people have a non-zero payoff for adopting the same technology as their closest friends or colleagues. If two users both adopt product A, they might get a payoff ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0; if they adopt product B, they get ''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. But if one adopts A and the other adopts B, they both get a payoff of&amp;nbsp;0.

A threshold can be set for each user to adopt a product. Say that a node v in a graph has d neighbors: then v will adopt product A if a fraction p of its neighbors is greater than or equal to some threshold. For example, if v's threshold is 2/3, and only one of its two neighbors adopts product A, then v will not adopt A. Using this model, we can deterministically model product adoption on sample networks.

==History==
The technology adoption lifecycle is a [[sociological]] model that is an extension of an earlier model called ''the diffusion process'', which was originally published in 1957 by Joe M. Bohlen, George M. Beal and [[Everett M. Rogers]] at [[Iowa State University]] and which was originally published only for its application to [[agriculture]] and [[home economics]].&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957&gt;{{cite journal

building on earlier research conducted there by Neal C. Gross and Bryce Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Neal C. (1942) ''The diffusion of a culture trait in two Iowa townships''. M.S. Thesis, Iowa State College, Ames.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Bryce, and Neal C. Gross (1943) “The diffusion of hybrid seed corn in two Iowa communities.” ''Rural Sociology'' 8: 15–24. RS(E)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Bryce, and Neal C. Gross (1950) ''Acceptance and diffusion of hybrid corn seed in two Iowa communities''. Research Bulletin 372, Agricultural Experiment Station, Ames, Iowa.&lt;/ref&gt; Their original purpose was to track the purchase patterns of hybrid seed corn by farmers.

Beal, Rogers and Bohlen together developed a model called ''the diffusion process''&lt;ref&gt;Beal, George M., Everett M. Rogers, and Joe M. Bohlen (1957) "Validity of the concept of stages in the adoption process." ''Rural Sociology'' 22(2):166–168.&lt;/ref&gt; and later, Everett Rogers generalized the use of it in his widely acclaimed book 1962 ''[[Diffusion of innovations|Diffusion of Innovations]]''&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Everett M. (1962). ''Diffusion of Innovations'', Glencoe: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (now in its fifth edition{{cn|date=November 2016}}), describing how new ideas and technologies spread in different cultures. Others have since used the model to describe how innovations spread between states in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Robert L. (1985). "Diffusion Research Traditions and the Spread of Policy Innovations in a Federal System" ''Publius'' 15 (Fall): 1–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tony Lepore''' (born October 17, 1947), aka '''the Dancing Cop''', is a retired American police officer who entertained on the streets of [[Providence, Rhode Island]] during the December holiday season while directing traffic using a dancing style.

Lepore began dancing in the street in 1984 as a way to relieve boredom.  After he retired, city leaders asked that he return during the holiday season in 1992 as a means of attracting people to the downtown area of Providence.  He agreed to a contract to return as a reserve police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dancing Cop Tony Lepore entertains drivers, pedestrians and curiosity seekers while directing traffic in Providence|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/dancing-entertains-drivers-pedestrians-providence-article-1.1223658|accessdate=20 December 2012|newspaper=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Providence officials let him go from his decades-long gig directing holiday traffic, allegedly as a result of organizing an anti-[[Black Lives Matter]] protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Black Lives Matter protesters target dancing cop’s new gig |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/black-lives-matter-protesters-target-dancing-cops-new-gig/2015/11/30/7830b4c0-9781-11e5-aca6-1ae3be6f06d2_story.html |newspaper=Washington Post |date=November 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lepore also does stage performances.[https://web.archive.org/web/20051030012857/http://riroads.com/links/listdetail.cgi?Lookup=10753503799126817]

The '''U.S.–Russia Joint Commission on POWs/MIAs''' (USRJC) was established in 1992 by the presidents of the [[United States]] and the [[Russian Federation]], [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Boris Yeltsin]]. The USRJC was established to determine the fates of the [[United States]]'s and the [[Soviet Union]]'s unaccounted-for service personnel from [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], the [[Cold War]] (as defined by the USRJC's directive to be specific "reconnaissance missions"), [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Vietnam War]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]].

Information exchanged between the two parties is then investigated by a spectrum of governmental entities. In the U.S., the [[Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office]] (DPMO) is the lead [[government agency|agency]] responsible for personnel accounting and personnel recovery. Numerous sub-agencies and offices are then tasked with further analysis and investigation, both in the US and abroad. The Russian side has established a similar [[hierarchy]] of agencies for reporting and vetting information. {{as of|2007|June}}, the Russian side has yet to formalize certain elements and access within its own [[Prisoner of War]] - [[Missing in Action]] or [[Killed in Action]] but Body Not Recovered program (Interagency Commission for Prisoners of War, Internees, and Missing in Action).

The USRJC is broken down into four [[Working Groups]] which correlate to the four main areas of investigation. There is the World War II Working Group, the Korean War Working Group, the Cold War Working Group and finally, the Vietnam War Working Group, which deals with aspects of the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]]. Additionally, the Cold War Working Group is tasked with research into the Soviet-Era [[GULAG]] system, forced labor camps, political and psychiatric hospitals, and Soviet detention facilities, in an effort to resolve the continued reporting of US service personnel who were taken to the former Soviet Union.

The Commission, holds a formal [[Plenary session|Plenary]] to discuss a spectrum of issues that involve Prisoners of War and Missing in Action such as; archival access and research, visitation to former Soviet detention facilities and camps, reported gravesites, loss incident reports, shoot-downs, archival reports, [[Soviet Bloc]] nation intelligence and reports, information passed on to the Commission and to establish the direction the USRJC and its Working Groups will take. Although the Commission is expected to hold annual Plenaries, it could be up to two years before a formal session is held.  Both sides, the US and Russia, have replaced their chairmen within the year. In the interim, Working Group sessions are held to discuss information, intelligence, related issues and to make or address specific inquiries.

The chairmen are Presidential appointees. In 2007, the corresponding chairmen are: For the US, General Robert H. "Doc" Foglesong, [[U.S. Air Force]] (Retired), [[Mississippi State University]] President. For the Russian Federation, General-Lieutenant [[Vladimir Shamanov]], [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]] (Retired). Additional members, or [[Commissioners]], of the USRJC represent various governmental agencies that work with the Commission on POW-MIA affairs. Some Commission Members are civilians, some are [[active duty]] military personnel.

Commission Members and field personnel travel to or are stationed in numerous [[Warsaw Pact]] countries. They continue to interview former military personnel, civilians, former Internees, contract for archival access, research, search military museums, and expand the investigative program in an effort to account for Missing service personnel. The US has a permanent DPMO office at the [[U.S. Embassy]] in [[Moscow]].

At various points in any given year, one nation may host the others researchers, archivists or investigators. In Spring 2004, Russian Archivists were hosted by DPMO. They spent several days at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] in [[Maryland]], discussing technical areas, archival research, how best to use the Russian archives, [[declassification]] of [[documents]], and a discussion on [[preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] of historic materials and documents. Representatives of both official government and private collections of documents and records will attend to share, teach and learn.

[[Violence against women]] in [[New Zealand]] is described as the kinds of violence faced by women disproportionately to men due to factors of ongoing [[gender inequality]] in society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recommendations/recomm.htm CEDAW General Recommendation 19] General Recommendation No. 19 (11th session, 1992), Paragraph 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The New Zealand government and the New Zealand justice system view efforts to prevent and deal with violence against women as a priority of New Zealand legislation and the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, ''Seventh Periodic Report of State Parties: New Zealand'', 7 January 2011, CEDAW/C/NZL/7, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Current laws relating to the prevention and punishment of violence against women are both international and domestic. Despite efforts to decrease the level of violence against women in New Zealand, women still face high levels of violence.

==Incidence of violence against women==

Despite the existence of legislation and social campaigns targeting the reduction of various forms of violence against women, women in New Zealand face high levels of domestic and [[sexual violence]].

Data on '''domestic violence against women''' in New Zealand is scarce. Data is largely dependent upon reporting and recording practices, and is unlikely to accurately represent the incidence of [[domestic violence]] against women in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nzfvc.org.nz/sites/nzfvc.org.nz/files/DS2-Violence-Against-Women-2014.pdf Data Summary 2: Violence Against Women] New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse "Data Summary: Violence Against Women", June 2014, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, there were 6749 incidents of ‘male assaults female’ recorded by the [[New Zealand Police]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://nzfvc.org.nz/sites/nzfvc.org.nz/files/DS2-Violence-Against-Women-2014.pdf Data Summary 2: Violence Against Women] New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse "Data Summary: Violence Against Women", June 2014, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, 2013 Protection Orders were granted by Family Court in accordance with the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nzfvc.org.nz/sites/nzfvc.org.nz/files/DS2-Violence-Against-Women-2014.pdf Data Summary 2: Violence Against Women] New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse "Data Summary: Violence Against Women", June 2014, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ninety percent of respondents named in Protection Order applications were male.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nzfvc.org.nz/sites/nzfvc.org.nz/files/DS2-Violence-Against-Women-2014.pdf Data Summary 2: Violence Against Women] New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse "Data Summary: Violence Against Women", June 2014, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, the National Collective of Independent Women's Refuges received 81,720 crisis calls and 2940 women (and children) accessed safe house services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nzfvc.org.nz/sites/nzfvc.org.nz/files/DS2-Violence-Against-Women-2014.pdf Data Summary 2: Violence Against Women] New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse "Data Summary: Violence Against Women", June 2014, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study]], a longitudinal cohort study of 1037 people born in [[Dunedin]] during 1972-73, found that by age 21, 27 percent of female study members reported they had been physically abused by a partner and 22 percent of male study members reported they had perpetrated violence against their partner. However, in contradiction to many other reports, the Dunedin study also found higher rates of domestic violence against men than against women, with 34 percent of male study members reporting physical abuse by a partner and 37 percent of female study members reporting they had perpetrated violence against their partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Moffitt | first=Terrie E. | author1link=Terrie Moffitt | last2=Caspi | first2=Avshalom E. | date=July 1999 | title=Findings About Partner Violence From the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/170018.pdf | page=2 | journal=National Institute of Justice: Research in Brief | accessdate= 4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 New Zealand Crime and Safety Survey (NZCASS), publishing survey data on crime that took place in 2008, sexual offences accounted for 5% of all offences reported in the survey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/n/nzcass-2009/documents/The%20New%20Zealand%20Crime%20and%20Safety%20Survey%202009%20Main%20Findings%20Rep.pdf NZCASS 2009] New Zealand Crime and Safety Survey 2009, Ministry of Justice, 2010, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand Police recorded crime for reported sexual offences in 2008 accounted for 1% of all offences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/n/nzcass-2009/documents/The%20New%20Zealand%20Crime%20and%20Safety%20Survey%202009%20Main%20Findings%20Rep.pdf NZCASS 2009] New Zealand Crime and Safety Survey 2009, Ministry of Justice, 2010, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In the NZCASS, 45% of people who had experienced sexual offences considered the incident a crime, 31% considered the incident ‘wrong, but not a crime’, and 23% considered the incident as ‘just something that happens’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/n/nzcass-2009/documents/The%20New%20Zealand%20Crime%20and%20Safety%20Survey%202009%20Main%20Findings%20Rep.pdf NZCASS 2009] New Zealand Crime and Safety Survey 2009, Ministry of Justice, 2010, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately one in four New Zealand women experience unwanted sexual contact in their lifetime, most often by someone known to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/supporting-victims/taskforce-for-action-on-sexual-violence/policy-and-consultation/taskforce-for-action-on-sexual-violence/documents/tasv-report-summary TASV Summary Report] ''Te Toiora Mata Tauherenga: Report of the Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence - Summary'', Ministry of Justice, 2009, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual offending costs the New Zealand economy approximately $1.2 billion NZD each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/supporting-victims/taskforce-for-action-on-sexual-violence/policy-and-consultation/taskforce-for-action-on-sexual-violence/documents/tasv-report-summary TASV Summary Report]''Te Toiora Mata Tauherenga: Report of the Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence - Summary'', Ministry of Justice, 2009, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand in 2008 there were 607 prosecuted cases for rape, of which just 29% resulted in convictions, compared with the 68% conviction rate for all offences.&lt;ref name="Connecting Women 2011, p. 103"&gt;WSANZ Conference 2010 "Connecting Women, Respecting Differences" Maxine Campbell, Carolyn Michelle and Rachel Simon-Kumar (eds), Women's Studies Association 3/2011, Wellington, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; A Ministry of Justice discussion paper exploring improvements to sexual violence legislation reported that around 90 percent of rapes go unreported.&lt;ref name="Connecting Women 2011, p. 103"/&gt; This makes it the least likely crime to be reported.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth McDonald and Yvette Tinsley (eds) "From "Real Rape" to Real Justice: Prosecuting Rape in New Zealand" Victoria University Press, Wellington, 2011, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Of Police files coded as sexual violation of an adult between 1 July 2005 and 31 December 2007, 95% of violations were of females.

=== NZCASS 2014 ===
The NZCASS 2014 features "Improvements in methodologies, systems and statistical processes help make statistics more complete, accurate and useful. As part of the 2014 NZCASS, estimates for both 2006 and 2009 have been revised and recalculated."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.justice.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Publications/NZCASS-201602-Main-Findings-Report-Updated.pdf] 2014 NEW ZEALAND CRIME AND SAFETY SURVEY TE RANGAHAU O AOTEAROA MŌ TE TAIHARA ME TE HAUMARUTANGA 2014
Main Findings&lt;/ref&gt; So the above figures can't always be compared to the following figures.

Overall women and men experienced the same amount of violence with 10% of respondents reporting one or more incidents. However, the type of violence was different . Women were more likely to have experienced violence from an intimate partner (5.7% female vs 4.4% male) and men more likely to experience violence from a stranger (2.7% female vs 4.0% male).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2013 an estimated 23.1% of violent interpersonal  offences against females were reported to the police. 29.8% of all crime against women was reported to the police. Crimes may have been reported to the police by someone in the victims household, or the victim may have been aware that the police found out about it from another source. There is no statistically significant difference between females and males reporting crimes to the police, or any significant change over time from 2005.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

35.4% of females consider their experience of a violent interpersonal offence a crime, 40.9%(with some statistical uncertainty) consider the event to be 'wrong, but not a crime' and 23.7% consider it to be 'just something that happens'.

The victims perception of the seriousness of the violent interpersonal offence was surveyed. 34.1% of females consider their experience to be 'low' seriousness, 22.4% moderate seriousness, and 43.5% 'high' seriousness. Similar to the results for males.

The has been a reduction in the reports of coercive control behaviours from their current partner between 2006 and 2013. Females where less likely to report coercive control (14.4% of females vs 17% of males). Most behaviors had similar rates but 9.2% of males reported their partner "gets angry if speaks to someone who is the same sex as their partner" compared to 4.8% of females.

==== Lifetime experience of partner violence and sexual violence. ====
Lifetime experience estimates are less reliable than asking about incidents in the previous 12 months because memory becomes more of an issue. Also, "the questionnaire does not explicitly ask this in reference to 'current' partner at the time of incident. Depending on the respondent's interpretation of the question, responses could include incidents by 'ex-partners'. Percentages include people who said 'yes', 'don't know / can't remember' and 'don’t' wish to answer'. The decision to include uninformative responses as if they had said they had experienced violence was based on literature findings that they are likely to be concealing a 'yes' response."

Overall there has been a reduction of lifetime reports of violence from partners. In 2006, 29.3% of females reported they had experienced one or more incidents of partner violence (assault, threats of force, threats to damage property, or damage – to property). This went down to 26.1% in 2013.

There was also a reduction in lifetime sexual violence (forced sexual intercourse, attempted forced sexual intercourse,  distressing sexual touching, or 'other sexual violence'). In 2006, 28.3% of females reported a lifetime experience of sexual violence compared to 23.8% in 2014.

Both lifetime partner violence reports and lifetime sexual violence reports for females are significantly higher for females than males. For partner violence, in 2014, 13.8% of males reported, compared to 26.1% of females. For sexual violence, in 2013, 5.6% of males reported, compared to 23.8% females.

==International Law==

New Zealand's international treaty obligations require the state to submit periodic reports to the [[United Nations]] (UN) [[Human Rights Council]] (HRC) under the [[Universal Periodic Review]] and to the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] under the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW). Under these obligations, New Zealand is required to uphold its commitments to [[international human rights]], including [[women's rights]], and is subject to the scrutiny and recommendations made by the periodic reviews.

===Universal Periodic Review===

New Zealand is currently subject to the [[Universal Periodic Review]] (UPR) mechanism conducted by the UN [[Human Rights Council]] (HRC). New Zealand's most recent UPR was held in 2013/2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/constitutional-law-and-human-rights/human-rights/international-human-rights-instruments/universal-periodic-review/upr-documents-relating-to-new-zealand-1 Ministry of Justice - Universal Periodic Review] Ministry of Justice - Universal Periodic Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

The national report submitted by New Zealand in 2013 identified the reduction of violence within families and its disproportionate impact upon women and children as a key priority of the New Zealand Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/184/80/PDF/G1318480.pdf?OpenElement UPR National Report New Zealand, 2nd Cycle] UN Human Rights Council, ''National Report: New Zealand'', 8 November 2013, A/HRC/WG.6/18/NZL/1, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that research in New Zealand had found that "Victims of the more severe and lethal cases of family violence are predominantly women and children. Women with disabilities and Maori women are a particularly vulnerable group."&lt;ref name="daccess-dds-ny.un.org"&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/184/80/PDF/G1318480.pdf?OpenElement UPR National Report New Zealand, 2nd Cycle] UN Human Rights Council, ''National Report: New Zealand'', 8 November 2013, A/HRC/WG.6/18/NZL/1, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review for New Zealand'', published in April 2014, New Zealand's acknowledgement of the high rate of family violence experienced by women was noted.&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Council, ''[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G14/131/43/PDF/G1413143.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Working Group: New Zealand]'', 7 April 2014, A/HRC/26/3, pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The report further recognised the Government's commitment to eradicate the problem, including taking steps to reconvene the Family Violence Ministerial Group, the introduction of Police Safety Orders, expanding the definition of domestic violence to include economic and financial abuse, implementing the 2009 Action Plan for New Zealand Women, and implementation of recommendations on the Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G14/131/43/PDF/G1413143.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Working Group: New Zealand] UN Human Rights Council, ''Report of the Working Group: New Zealand'', 7 April 2014, A/HRC/26/3, pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the report were recommendations from seventeen other states suggesting measures for the reduction of violence against women in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G14/131/43/PDF/G1413143.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Working Group: New Zealand] UN Human Rights Council, ''Report of the Working Group: New Zealand'', 7 April 2014, A/HRC/26/3, pp. 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand government accepted the majority of these recommendations and detailed the steps taken in carrying out the recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Council, ''Report of the Working Group: Addendum'', 26 May 2014, A/HRC/26/3/Add.1, pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] presented a '''compilation report''' on submissions to New Zealand's UPR. The concerns of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women were emphasised.&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Council, ''Report of the Working Group: Addendum'', 26 May 2014, A/HRC/26/3/Add.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women===

Under New Zealand's [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]] obligations, New Zealand is required to submit periodic reports on the implementation of CEDAW to the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] (the Committee). New Zealand's most recent periodic report on its obligations under CEDAW was in 2010/2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://women.govt.nz/sites/public_files/cedaw-2010.pdf The Status of Women in New Zealand], Ministry of Women's Affairs, ''The Status of Women in New Zealand: CEDAW Report 2010'', Wellington, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1989, it has been common practice for parties to CEDAW to include in their periodic reports to the Committee information on any legislation protecting women against all kinds of violence, measures adopted to eradicate violence, existence of support systems for women who are the victims of violence, and statistical data on women who are the victims of violence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recommendations/recomm.htm CEDAW General Recommendation 12] General Recommendation No. 12 (8th session, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2010 the scope of Article 2 of CEDAW was described to include a due diligence obligation on states to prevent discrimination by private actors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G10/472/60/PDF/G1047260.pdf?OpenElement General Recommendation 28], Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, ''General Recommendation No. 28'', CEDAW/C/GC/28, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand government's report to the Committee====
In the New Zealand government's report to the Committee in January 2011 it was considered that the reduction of "the damaging impact of violence against women, in particular sexual violence" was a priority of the New Zealand government,&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Seventh Periodic Report of State Parties: New Zealand, 7 January 2011, CEDAW/C/NZL/7, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "violence against women remains cause for immense concern".&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, ''Seventh Periodic Report of State Parties: New Zealand'', 7 January 2011, CEDAW/C/NZL/7, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; The report made the observations that although the recorded rates of family violence in New Zealand were rising, New Zealand had launched social campaigns such as the 'It's not OK' campaign, completed ongoing work through the Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families, and set up the Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, ''Seventh Periodic Report of State Parties: New Zealand'', 7 January 2011, CEDAW/C/NZL/7, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded that, "Government is committed to reducing violence against women," and that, "there is no acceptable level of family violence and that the notion that family violence is normal or acceptable must be dispelled."&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, ''Seventh Periodic Report of State Parties: New Zealand'', 7 January 2011, CEDAW/C/NZL/7, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

====Concluding observations of the Committee====
In its concluding observations, issued in August 2012, the Committee noted its concern about the continued high levels of violence against women and low rates of reporting and conviction, particularly in instances of sexual violence, despite progress made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://women.govt.nz/sites/public_files/CEDAW%20concluding%20observations%202012.pdf CEDAW Concluding Observations: New Zealand], Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, ''Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women: New Zealand'', 27 July 2012, CEDAW/C/NLZ/CO/7, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It expressed further concern at "insufficient" statistical data on violence against women, particularly against Maori women, migrant women, and women with disabilities.&lt;ref name="women.govt.nz"&gt;[http://women.govt.nz/sites/public_files/CEDAW%20concluding%20observations%202012.pdf CEDAW Concluding Observations: New Zealand], Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, ''Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women: New Zealand'', 27 July 2012, CEDAW/C/NLZ/CO/7, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee called upon New Zealand to take steps to encourage reporting of violence against women, to strengthen training for relevant authorities in dealing with violence against women, to provide assistance and protection services for women victims of violence, and to ensure systematic collection and publication of disaggregated data, and "monitor effectiveness of legislation, policy and practice to all forms of violence against women and girls."&lt;ref name="women.govt.nz"/&gt;

====Follow-up to the concluding observations====
New Zealand provided information in the follow-up to the concluding observations elucidating changes being made to better use and collect data regarding violence against women, including steps to ensure the collection and analysis of disaggregated data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://women.govt.nz/sites/public_files/CEDAW%20report%20follow-up%202014_0.pdf CEDAW Follow-Up], Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, ''Information provided by New Zealand in follow-up to the concluding observations'', 3 December 2014, CEDAW/C/NZL/CO/7/Add.1, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The government response to the Committee's concluding observations also discussed changes to the Domestic Violence Act 1995 and the taking of a "long-term approach" to ending family violence through promoting changes in attitude and behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://women.govt.nz/sites/public_files/CEDAW%20report%20follow-up%202014_0.pdf CEDAW Follow-Up], Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, ''Information provided by New Zealand in follow-up to the concluding observations'', 3 December 2014, CEDAW/C/NZL/CO/7/Add.1, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual offences===

'''Sexual offences''' are defined in the '''Crimes Act 1961'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM327382.html Crimes Act 1961]&lt;/ref&gt; The crime of rape or unlawful sexual connection requires that the accused did not have the person's consent and did not believe on reasonable grounds that the person was consenting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM327382.html Crimes Act 1961], Crimes Act 1961, Section 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2008 discussion document issued by the Ministry of Justice called for submissions on the inclusion of ‘positive consent’, the inclusion of broader investigation into the surrounding circumstances in determining whether the accused had reasonable grounds for consent, and the extension of the ‘rape shield’ to limit a defendant's ability to question a complainant about their past sexual behaviour.&lt;ref name="justice.govt.nz"&gt;[http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/supporting-victims/sexual-violence/documents/6064-2-MOJ-SV-discussion-document-ff-WEB.pdf Ministry of Justice Discussion Document], Ministry of Justice, ''Improvements to Sexual Violation Legislation in New Zealand: Public Discussion Document'', August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the question was raised over the models and practices of the current justice system in dealing with sexual violence.&lt;ref name="justice.govt.nz"/&gt; In 2009 the '''Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence''' produced a report including recommendations on preventing sexual violence, creating specialist front-line services for victims and offenders, reforming criminal justice, and approaches to end sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/supporting-victims/taskforce-for-action-on-sexual-violence/policy-and-consultation/taskforce-for-action-on-sexual-violence/documents/tasv-report-full TASV Report], ''Te Toiora Mata Tauherenga: Report of the Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence'', Ministry of Justice, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The report recommended the completion of a Sexual Violence Prevention Plan, a review of funding for crisis support services, legislative changes to the [[Accident Compensation Corporation]] scheme, legislative amendments to the Crimes Act 1961, and an exploration of alternative justice in cases of sexual offences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/supporting-victims/taskforce-for-action-on-sexual-violence/policy-and-consultation/taskforce-for-action-on-sexual-violence/documents/tasv-report-summary TASV Summary Report] ''Te Toiora Mata Tauherenga: Report of the Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence - Summary'', Ministry of Justice, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand government responded to the report in September 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/supporting-victims/taskforce-for-action-on-sexual-violence/documents/Government%20Response%20to%20TASV%20Report.pdf TASV Government Response Document], Ministry of Justice, ''Government Response to Te Toiora Mata Tauherenga: Report of the Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence'', September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; however it was noted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2012 that many of the recommendations in the report have yet to be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://women.govt.nz/sites/public_files/CEDAW%20concluding%20observations%202012.pdf CEDAW Concluding Observations: New Zealand], Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, ''Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women: New Zealand'', 27 July 2012, CEDAW/C/NLZ/CO/7, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence against Māori women in New Zealand==
In February 2015 the New Zealand [[Ministry for Women]] released a report stating that Māori women are twice as likely as other New Zealand women to experience some form of violence.&lt;ref name="wahineora"&gt;[http://women.govt.nz/sites/public_files/Wahine%20Maori%20wahine%20ora%20wahine%20kaha.pdf Wāhine Māori, Wāhine Ora, Wāhine Kaha: Preventing violence against Māori women.] Ministry for Women. February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is mostly due to the epidemic  of whānau violence; a wider form of [[domestic violence]] including [[intimate partner violence (IPV)]], [[child abuse]], [[elder abuse]], [[Parental abuse by children|parental abuse]], [[sibling abuse]], or any other family member abuse.

===Victims and perpetrators===
Whilst family violence occurs in all socio-economic groupings in New Zealand, Maori are over represented as both the victims and perpetrators.&lt;ref name="kaupapa"&gt;[https://nzfvc.org.nz/sites/nzfvc.org.nz/files/issues-paper-6-2014_0.pdf Kaupapa Māori wellbeing framework: The basis for whānau violence prevention and intervention.] New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse. April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant concern for entities such as the-then [[Superu|New Zealand Families Commission]] is partner violence; with Māori women being at a three times higher risk of IPV than other women.&lt;ref name="fvstats"&gt;Family Violence Statistics Report 2009. Families Commission, Wellington New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another chief concern of government agencies such as the [[Ministry of Social Development (New Zealand)|Ministry of Social Development]] is child abuse.
Just over half of [[Child, Youth and Family (New Zealand)|Child, Youth and Family]] clients whom have at least one substantiated abuse finding are Māori. Of this total number, a little over half are girls meaning that Māori girls are at a higher risk than any other children in New Zealand of experiencing abuse.&lt;ref name="towardsfreedom"&gt;[http://ethniccommunities.govt.nz/sites/default/files/files/Towards%20Freedom%20from%20Violence%20-%20NZ%20Family%20Violence%20Statistics%20Disaggregated%20by%20Ethnicity%20-%20Office%20of%20Ethnic%20Affairs%202013.pdf Towards Freedom from Violence.] New Zealand Family Violence Statistics Disaggregated by Ethnicity by the Office of Ethnic Affairs. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of whānau violence are not as largely represented in statistics, however they still make up for a moderate percentage of violence against Māori women. Between 2011 and 2012 Māori women were the most common gender and ethnic group to be admitted to hospital following assault with the perpetrator being identified as a family member. More than two thirds of the total number of assault hospitalisations were women and half of the total were Māori. Of these cases, about 19% of the perpetrators were identified as ‘other' family members, with spouse/domestic partners being the outstanding perpetrators.&lt;ref name="towardsfreedom"/&gt;

===Contributing factors===
The major contributing factors for family violence in New Zealand is social and economic disadvantage regarding education, employment, health, housing and income.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Social Development. The Scale and Nature of Family Violence in New Zealand: A Review and Evaluation of Knowledge. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hardship experienced by Māori is seen as a key factor which, when combined with other factors, significantly increases the risk of whānau violence.&lt;ref name="intervention"&gt;[https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/family-violence.pdf Family Violence Intervention Guidelines - Child and Partner Abuse.] Ministry of Health. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployment rates for young Māori women who are under 25 years of age are twice that of European women, with more than one in four Māori youth in the labour market being unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Human Rights Commission’s Report to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) Participation by NHRIs. 52nd session, 18 July.&lt;/ref&gt;
For those who are employed, the median income is significantly lower than that of other ethnicities such as New Zealand European; with the median income for Māori over the age of 15 being $22,500.&lt;ref name="heraldarticle"&gt;As at 2013, [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10823115 Income gap between the races gets wider.] Simon Collins. The New Zealand Herald.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beneficiaries and those in sole parent households are also at a much higher risk to fall victim to family violence than other women.&lt;ref name="fvstats" /&gt; Currently, Māori make up for almost a third of the total proportion of beneficiaries in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="heraldarticle" /&gt; Further hardship in regards to housing is illustrated by [[Statistics New Zealand]] findings from 2006, estimating that almost a quarter of Māori live in crowded households.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics New Zealand (2012). Ethnicity and crowding: A detailed examination of crowding among ethnic groups in New Zealand 1986–2006. Wellington, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest rates of IPV have been found to occur within young families,&lt;ref&gt;Koziol-McLain J, Rameka M, Giddings L, Fyfe E, Gardiner J. Partner violence prevalence among women attending a Māori health provider clinic. Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; signalling that age is another contributing factor to violence. Statistics New Zealand show that the Māori population is largely young.&lt;ref&gt;Based on [http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/estimates_and_projections/MaoriPopulationEstimates_HOTPAtJun14.aspx Māori Population Estimates] from Statistics New Zealand at 30 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This factor combined with social and economic hardship may be the reason for over representation of Māori in family violence statistics in New Zealand.

In a study of a group of Māori women who have experienced whānau violence, the women identified financial dependence on other family members, in particular partners/spouses, as a key contributing factor for violence. They identified the link beginning at education through to employment opportunities and adequate income with freedom of choice, independence, safety and equal power and control.&lt;ref name="wahineora" /&gt;

====Influence of drugs and alcohol====
Stemming from social and economic factors contributing to violence against Māori women is the use of drugs and alcohol by Māori. Drug and alcohol use is influenced by easy accessibility in low-income neighbourhoods due to a high number of alcohol outlets, community norms of heavy binge drinking and use of illegal drugs and use as a coping mechanism for poverty, poor health and racism.&lt;ref&gt;Women and Alcohol  in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Jenny Rankine with Amanda Gregory, Anna Tonks and Te Pora Thompson-Evans 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst rates of alcohol-related assault vary widely in different populations of women, five percent of all women in New Zealand have reported physical assault due to someone else's drinking. This rate is significantly higher for young women, women living in deprived areas, and Māori women.&lt;ref&gt;Alcohol use in New Zealand: Analysis of the 2004 New Zealand health behaviours survey - Alcohol use. Ministry of Health 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 survey by the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health]], Māori women were found to be almost four times more likely than non-Māori women to have been assaulted in the past year by someone under the influence of drugs or alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Alcohol use in New Zealand: Key results of the 2007/08 Alcohol and Drug Use survey. Ministry of Health 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, significantly more Māori victims of violent incidents committed by a partner or other well-known person said the offender was affected by drugs (45%) or alcohol (59%), as opposed to European victims (22% and 35% respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, C., Triggs, S., &amp; Faisandier, S. Analysis of the Maori experience: Findings from The New Zealand Crime and Safety Survey 2006. Ministry of Justice 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learned behaviour theory===
The Mauri Ora framework was created by the Second Māori Taskforce on whānau violence to further the current understanding of whānau violence. 
The framework acknowledged that whānau violence is a learned and practiced behaviour that has become normalised and entrenched through several generations.&lt;ref name="taskforce" /&gt;

This concern, that violence and abuse is a learned behaviour, is supported by findings that children who are raised within violent family environments do not understand the negative consequences of the use of violence and are more likely to adopt violent behaviour within their own families as they mature.&lt;ref&gt;Balzer R, Haimona D, Henare M, Matchitt V. Māori Family Violence in Aotearoa. Wellington: Te Puni Kokiri 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who witness violence between their parents are also at a much greater risk of later adjustment difficulties such as antisocial behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Sousa, C., Herrenkohl, T. I., Moylan, C. A., Tajima, E. A., Klika, J. B., Herrenkohl, R. C., &amp; Russo, M. J. Longitudinal study on the effects of child abuse and children's exposure to domestic violence, parent-child attachments, and antisocial behavior in adolescence. Journal of Interpersonal Violence 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, the Second Māori Taskforce on whānau violence labelled whanau violence as an epidemic, acknowledging that the objective of zero tolerance of whānau violence would take time to become unlearned.&lt;ref name="taskforce"&gt;Kruger, T., Pitman M., Grennell D., McDonald T., Mariu D., Pomare A., Mita T., Maihi M.,
Lawson-Te Aho K. [https://nzfvc.org.nz/sites/nzfvc.org.nz/files/transforming_whanau_violence.pdf Transforming Whānau Violence - A Conceptual Framework] Updated version from the former Second Māori Taskforce on Whānau Violence 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of community organisations by Māori women and children===
The Ministry of Health has suggested that Māori women and children often use health and community services later than others, meaning that when they do their injuries and issues are more serious.&lt;ref name="intervention" /&gt;

Community organisations such as the New Zealand Women's Refuge have attempted to make their services more accessible to Māori women and children experiencing whānau violence by providing culturally appropriate services. Of the 45 local refuges around New Zealand,  14 ‘whares’ (houses) have been specifically designed by Māori for wahine (Māori women) and their tamariki (children) and whānau. The whares’ aim to eliminate violence whilst promoting Māori values such as the wellbeing of whānau, promoting mana (strength), transformation and creating support within the wider community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://womensrefuge.org.nz/WR/Get-help/Maori-wahine.htm New Zealand Women's Refuge]&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures from 2011 and 2012 support the introduction of these specialised refuges for Māori women as half of the total number of women who used Women's Refuge services were identified as Māori.&lt;ref name="towardsfreedom" /&gt;

===Current prevention techniques===
The Ministry for Women acknowledge that when dealing with violence there are three stages of prevention, namely, primary (before violence occurs, with a focus on large groups) and secondary and tertiary (after violence occurs, with a targeted focus on victims and offenders).&lt;ref name="ministryofwomen"&gt;Current Thinking on Primary Prevention of  Violence Against Women. Ministry of Women’s Affairs October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry has noted that previously most primary prevention approaches for violence against women specifically targeted women but has recently begun to include men and boys. The aim of this is to educate men and boys, as partners, to promote respectful, non-violent relationships in which each partner feels safe and supported.&lt;ref&gt;Blakeslee, K.M., Patel, D.M., and Simon, M.A. Communications and Technology for Violence Prevention: workshop summary. The National Academies Press 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The shift towards engaging boys and men in the prevention of violence against women recognizes that men are the primary perpetrators of violence against women. It also encourages male socialisation and encourages non-violent men to serve as positive role models and to act as active bystanders to prevent and intervene in situations involving violence towards women.&lt;ref name="ministryofwomen" /&gt;

The [[Department of Corrections (New Zealand)|New Zealand Department of Corrections]] has recognised that whānau violence perpetrators have a range of individual problems such as anger, hostility and personality disorders from having witnessed or suffered abuse as children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corrections.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/673025/COR_Community_Based_Domestic_Violence_Interventions_WEB_2.pdf Community-based Domestic Violence Interventions ] Marilize Slabber. Department of Corrections 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Current prevention techniques include providing education, information and support services to implement changes in attitude and behaviour for not only the victims and perpetrators of whānau violence but also for the whānau and wider community.&lt;ref&gt;Māori Reference Group for the Taskforce for Action on Violence Within Families. E Tu Whānau-ora: Programme of Action for Addressing Family Violence 2008-2013. Ministry of Social Development 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on the wider community is of particular importance as it focuses on the large scale of whānau violence and aims to shift attitudes and norms within the Māori culture.

Another culturally sensitive prevention technique is the Mauri Ora framework which incorporates Maori principles and values such as whakapapa (genealogy), tikanga (general behaviour guidelines for daily life and interaction within the Māori culture), wairua (spirit), tapu (forbidden/sacred values), mauri (the essence of emotions), and mana (power). These cultural constructs help to give priority to Māori culture, knowledge and identity when addressing the issue of whānau violence. They also help non-Māori to understand the different approach required on the path to eliminating whānau violence. The framework aims to apply the principles in practice when facing contemporary issues of today such as colonisation. This is a fairly new approach focussing on the preservation of Māori values within the environmental and contextual influences of modern New Zealand.&lt;ref name="kaupapa" /&gt;

The '''World Avocado Congress''' (WAC) is a [[Anniversary#quadrennial|quadrennial]] meeting of [[avocado]] producers, researchers, marketers and other interested parties from several countries, for the purpose of information sharing and networking.

==History==
The event was founded by Jan Toerien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brokaw|first1=W.H.|title=The World Avocado Congress: What We Learned|journal=[[California Avocado Society]] 1987 Yearbook|date=1987|volume=71|pages=49–54|url=http://www.avocadosource.com/CAS_Yearbooks/CAS_71_1987/CAS_1987_PG_49-54.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first WAC was held in [[Johannesburg]], South [[Africa]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://209.143.153.251/wac1/wac1_p005.pdf Opening Address of the first World Avocado Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; During the planning session for the second WAC in 1999 Dr. Mary-Lu Arpaia, a researcher from the [[University of California Riverside]], proposed that an International Avocado Society (IAS) be formed and charged with the responsibility of organizing the WAC every four years. It was accepted by vote and the IAS was formed, with representatives from different countries selected for its initial organizing committee. At the first meeting of these representatives on 26 April 1991, Hank Brokaw and Dr. Arpaia was elected as co-chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IAS - A bit of history|url=https://ias2011.wordpress.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brigada_Jovan_Popovic_cetvrta_ceta_Loznica_1964.jpg|thumb|A youth work brigade from the 1960s]]

'''Youth work actions''' ([[Serbo-Croatian]]: ''Omladinske radne akcije'', often abbreviated to ''ORA'', [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]]: ''Mladinske delovne akcije'') were organized voluntary labor activities of young people in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. The actions were used to build public infrastructure such as roads, railways, and public buildings, as well as industrial infrastructure. The youth work actions were organized on local, republic and federal levels by the [[Young Communist League of Yugoslavia]], and participants were organized into '''youth work brigades''', generally named after their town or a local [[Order of the National Hero|national hero]]. Important projects built by youth work brigades include the [[Brčko-Banovići railway]], the [[Šamac-Sarajevo railway]], parts of [[New Belgrade]], and parts of the [[Highway "Brotherhood and Unity"|Highway of Brotherhood and Unity]], which stretches from northern [[Slovenia]] to southern [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].

Initial actions were organized during the [[Second World War]] in territories liberated by the [[partisans (Yugoslavia)|partisans]]. After the war, actions were numerous and massive and the youth brigades made significant contributions to the rebuilding of their country, which was badly ravaged by war. In addition to cheap labor for the state, youth work actions provided a form of free holiday for teenagers.

As the country was rebuilt and its economy stabilized, youth work actions went out of fashion. However, they were revived in the late 1970s, in an effort to voluntary organize youth in political and cultural activities, as the work actions proved to play a large role in the socialization of those involved.
