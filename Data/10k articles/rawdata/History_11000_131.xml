The '''1930s''' (pronounced "nineteen-thirties", commonly abbreviated as the "'''Thirties'''") was a [[decade]] of the [[Gregorian calendar]] that began on January 1, 1930, and ended on December 31, 1939.

After the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the largest [[stock market crash]] in American history, most of the decade was consumed by an economic downfall called the [[Great Depression]] that had a traumatic effect worldwide, leading to widespread [[unemployment]] and [[poverty]], especially in the [[United States]], an economic superpower, and [[Germany]], who had to deal with the reparations regarding [[World War I]]. The [[Dust Bowl]] (which gives the nickname the Dirty Thirties) in the United States further emphasised the scarcity of wealth. [[Herbert Hoover]] worsened the situation with his failed attempt to balance the budget by raising taxes. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was elected, as a response, in 1933, and introduced the [[New Deal]]. The founding of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) and the funding of numerous projects (e.g. the [[Hoover Dam]]) helped restore prosperity in the US.

Meanwhile, [[authoritarian]] regimes emerged in several countries in Europe and South America, in particular the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] in Germany. Germany elected [[Adolf Hitler]], who imposed the [[Nuremberg Laws]], a series of laws which discriminated against [[Jews]] and other ethnic minorities. Weaker states such as [[Ethiopia]], [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]], and Poland were invaded by expansionist world powers, the last of these attacks leading to the outbreak of the [[World War II]] on September 1, 1939, despite calls from the [[League of Nations]] for worldwide peace. World War II helped end the Great Depression when governments spent money for the war effort. The 1930s also saw a proliferation of new technologies, especially in the fields of intercontinental [[aviation]], [[radio]], and [[film]].

==Politics and wars==
===Wars===
[[File:Kamp-wrzes22-anim.gif|upright|thumb|The outbreak of '''[[World War II]]''': Until the beginning of October 1939 both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union conquer [[Poland]] entirely in accordance with the secret part of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]]] 
* [[Colombia–Peru War]] (1 September 1932 – 24 May 1933) – fought between the [[Republic of Colombia]] and the [[Republic of Peru]].
* [[Chaco War]] (15 June 1932 – 10 June 1935) – the war was fought between [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] over the disputed territory of [[Gran Chaco]] resulting in an overall Paraguayan victory in 1935. An agreement dividing the territory was made in 1938, officially ending outstanding differences and bringing an official "peace" to the conflict.
* [[Saudi–Yemeni War (1934)|Saudi–Yemeni War]] (March 1934 – 12 May 1934) – was a war between [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]].
* [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (7 July 1937 – 9 September 1945) – fought between the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] and the [[Empire of Japan]]. The Second Sino-Japanese War was the largest Asian war in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=132824|author=Bix, Herbert P. |title=The Showa Emperor's 'Monologue' and the Problem of War Responsibility|journal=Journal of Japanese Studies|volume= 18|issue=2|year=1992|pages=295–363}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also made up more than 50% of the casualties in the Pacific War.
* [[World War II]] breaks out on September 1, 1939

===Internal conflicts===
* [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927–49) – The ruling [[Kuomintang]] and the rebel [[Communist Party of China]] fight a civil war for control of China. The Communists consolidated territory in the early 1930s and proclaimed a short-lived [[Chinese Soviet Republic]] that collapsed upon Kuomintang attacks, forcing a mass retreat known as the [[Long March]]. The Kuomintang and Communists attempted to put away their differences after 1937 to fight the Japanese occupation of China, but intermittent clashes continued through the remainder of the 1930s.
* [[Spanish Civil War]] (17 July 1936 – 1 April 1939) – Germany and Italy back anti-communist [[Falange Española y de las JONS|Falange]] forces of [[Francisco Franco]]. The [[Soviet Union]] and international communist parties (see [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]]) back the left-wing republican faction in the war. The war ends in April 1939 with Franco's nationalist forces defeating the republican forces. Franco becomes [[List of heads of state of Spain|Head of State of Spain]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Spain|President of Government]] and de facto dictator. The Republic gives way to the [[Spanish State]], an [[authoritarian]] [[dictatorship]].
* [[Castellammarese War]] (1929 – 10 September 1931).

===Major political changes===
'''The rise of [[Nazism]]'''
[[File:Hitlermusso2 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|right|German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] (right) and Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] (left) pursue agendas of territorial expansion for their countries in the 1930s, eventually leading to the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939.]]
* [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] rise to power in Germany in 1933, forming a [[Fascism|fascist]] regime committed to repudiating the [[Treaty of Versailles]], persecuting and removing [[Jews]] and other minorities from German society, expanding Germany's territory, and opposing the spread of [[communism]].
* Hitler pulls Germany out of the League of Nations, but hosts the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] to show his new reich to the world as well as the supposed superior athleticism of his [[Aryan race|Aryan]] troops/athletes.
*[[Neville Chamberlain]], [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] (1937–1940), attempts the [[appeasement]] of Hitler in hope of avoiding war by allowing the dictator to annex the [[Sudetenland]] (the German-speaking regions of [[Czechoslovakia]]), later signing the [[Munich Agreement]] and promising constituents "[[Peace for our time]]". He was ousted in favor of [[Winston Churchill]] in May 1940, after the [[Invasion of Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Lynn. "The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures" Vol. C since 1740.Bedford/St. Martin's, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The assassination of the German diplomat [[Ernst vom Rath]] by a German-born Polish Jew triggers the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (Night of Broken Glass) which occurred between 9 and 10 November 1938, carried out by the [[Hitler Youth]], the [[Gestapo]], and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], during which much of the Jewish population living in Nazi Germany and Austria was attacked – 91 Jews were murdered, and between 25,000 and 30,000 more were arrested and sent to [[Nazi concentration camp]]s. Some 267 synagogues were destroyed, and thousands of homes and businesses were ransacked. ''Kristallnacht'' also served as the pretext for the wholesale confiscation of firearms from German Jews.
* Germany and Italy pursue territorial expansionist agendas. Germany demands the annexation of the [[Federal State of Austria]] and of other German-speaking territories in Europe. Between 1935 and 1936, Germany recovers the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] and re-militarizes the [[Rhineland]]. Italy initially opposes Germany's aims for Austria, but in 1936 the two countries resolve their differences in the aftermath of Italy's diplomatic isolation following the start of the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], Germany becoming Italy's only remaining ally. Germany and Italy improve relations by forming an alliance against communism in 1936 with the signing of the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]]. Germany annexes Austria in the event known as the [[Anschluss]]. The annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] followed negotiations which resulted in the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938. The [[Italian invasion of Albania]] in 1939 succeeds in turning the [[Albania under Italy|Kingdom of Albania]] into an Italian [[protectorate]]. The vacant Albanian throne was claimed by [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-8240-7029-1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zabecki, David T.|authorlink=|editor=|others=|title=World War II in Europe: an encyclopedia|edition=|language=|publisher=Garland Pub|location=New York|year=1999|origyear=|pages=1353|quote=|isbn=0-8240-7029-1|oclc=|doi=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gYDN-UfehEEC&amp;pg=PA1353&amp;dq=albania+%22Italian+protectorate%22|accessdate=12 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222063745/https://books.google.com/books?id=gYDN-UfehEEC&amp;pg=PA1353&amp;dq=albania+%22Italian+protectorate%22|archivedate=22 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany receives the [[Klaipėda Region|Memel]] territory from [[Lithuania]], occupies what remains of [[Czechoslovakia]], and finally invades the [[Second Polish Republic]], the last of these events resulting in the outbreak of [[World War II]].
* In 1939, several countries of the Americas, including Canada, [[Cuba]], and the United States, controversially deny asylum to hundreds of German Jewish refugees on board the [[MS St. Louis|MS ''St. Louis'']] who are fleeing the Nazi regime's racist agenda of [[anti-Semitic]] persecution in Germany. In the end, no country accepts the refugees, and the ship returns to Germany with most of its passengers on board. Some commit suicide, rather than return to [[Nazi Germany]].

'''United States'''
[[File:Roosevelt signing TVA Act (1933).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[New Deal]]: President Franklin D. Roosevelt signs the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] Act, 18 May 1933]]

* [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] is elected President of the United States in November 1932. Roosevelt initiates a widespread social welfare strategy called the "[[New Deal]]" to combat the economic and social devastation of the [[Great Depression]]. The economic agenda of the "New Deal" was a radical departure from previous [[laissez-faire]] economics.
'''Saudi Arabia'''
* The [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]] is proclaimed the Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]], concluding the country's [[Unification of Saudi Arabia|unification]] under the rule of [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Ibn Saud]].
'''Spain'''
* The Republican parties win the [[Spanish local elections, 1931|local elections]], and proclaim the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]], kicking out the monarchy of [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII of Borbón]].
* The [[Spanish coup of July 1936]] against the Republic marks the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]].

=== Colonization ===
* The [[Ethiopian Empire]] is invaded by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] during the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] from 1935 to 1936. The occupied territory merges with [[Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]] into the colony of [[Italian East Africa]].
* The [[Empire of Japan]] captures [[Manchuria]] in 1931, creating the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]]. A puppet government was created, with [[Puyi]], the last [[Qing dynasty]] [[Emperor of China]], installed as the nominal regent and emperor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9371137/Manchukuo "Manchukuo "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221081805/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9371137/Manchukuo |date=2007-12-21 }} ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decolonization and independence ===
* In March 1930 [[Mohandas Gandhi]] leads the non-violent [[Satyagraha]] movement in the [[Declaration of the Independence of India]] and the [[Salt Satyagraha|Salt March]].
* The [[Government of India Act 1935]] creates new directly elected bodies, although with a limited franchise, and increases the autonomy of the [[Presidencies and provinces of British India]].

=== Prominent political events ===

*The [[NSDAP]] ([[Nazi Party]]) under [[Adolf Hitler]] wins the [[German federal election, March 1933]]. Hitler becomes [[List of Chancellors of Germany|Chancellor of Germany]]. Following the 1934 death in office of [[Paul von Hindenburg]], [[List of German presidents since 1919|President of Germany]], Hitler's cabinet passed a law proclaiming the presidency vacant and transferred the role and powers of the head of state to Hitler as ''[[Führer|Führer und Reichskanzler]]'' (leader and chancellor). The [[Weimar Republic]] effectively gives way to [[Nazi Germany]], a [[Totalitarian]] [[autocratic]] [[Nazism|national socialist]] [[dictatorship]].
*The [[Great Depression]] seriously affects the economic, political, and social aspects of society across the world.
*Major conflict occurs across the world such as the [[Chaco War]], the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Chinese Civil War]], the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and the outbreak of World War II on September 1, 1939.
*Collapse of the [[League of Nations]] as countries like Germany, the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and the [[Empire of Japan]] abdicate the League.

====Europe====
[[File:GolodomorKharkiv.jpg|thumb|[[Soviet famine of 1932–33]]. Starved peasants in the streets of Kharkiv, 1933.]]
* In 1930, [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]], [[Prime Minister of Spain]] and head of a [[military dictatorship]] is forced to resign in response to a financial crisis (part of the [[Great Depression]]). [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]], who had previously backed the dictatorship, attempts to return gradually to the previous system and restore his prestige. This failed utterly, as the King was considered a supporter of the dictatorship, and more and more political forces called for the establishment of a republic. In 1931, republican and socialist parties won a major victory in the local elections, while the monarchists were in decline. Street riots ensued, calling for the removal of the monarchy. The [[Spanish Army]] declared that they would not defend the King. Alfonso flees the country, effectively abdicating and ending the [[Spain under the Restoration|Bourbon Restoration]] phase which had started in the 1870s. A [[Second Spanish Republic]] emerges.
* In the [[Soviet Union]], [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|agricultural collectivization]] and rapid [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)|industrialization take place]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = A. L. Unger|title = Stalin's Renewal of the Leading Stratum: A Note on the Great Purge|journal = [[Soviet Studies]]| volume = 20|number = 3|pages = 321–330 |jstor=149486|doi = 10.1080/09668136808410659 |date= January 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Millions died during the [[Holodomor]].
* More than 25 million people migrate to cities in the Soviet Union.
* [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] is signed in 1935, removing the [[Treaty of Versailles]]' level of limitation on the size of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (navy). The agreement allows Germany to build a larger naval force.
* [[Éamon de Valera]] introduces a new [[constitution]] for the [[Irish Free State]] in 1937, effectively ending its status as a [[Dominion|British Dominion]].
* The "[[Great Purge]]" of "[[Old Bolsheviks]]" from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] takes place from 1936 to 1938, as ordered by [[Soviet Union]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]], resulting in hundreds of thousands of people being killed. This purge was due to mistrust and political differences, as well as the massive drop in Grain produce. This was due to the method of collectivization in Russia. The Soviet Union produced 16 million lbs of grain less in 1934 compared to 1930. This led to the starvation of millions of Russians.
* The [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|1937 World's Fair]] in Paris, France displays the growing political tensions in Europe. The pavilions of the rival countries of [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] face each other. Germany at the time was internationally condemned for [[Luftwaffe]] (its air force) having performed a [[Bombing of Guernica|bombing]] of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] town of [[Guernica (town)|Guernica]] in Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Spanish artist [[Pablo Picasso]] depicted the bombing in his masterpiece painting ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' at the World Fair, which was a [[Surrealism|surrealist]] depiction of the horror of the bombing. 
* Referendum in the [[Irish Free State]] in December 1937 on whether Ireland should continue to be a constitutional monarchy under King [[George VI]] or to become a [[republic]] results in citizens voting in favour of a republic, ending the remains of British sovereignty through monarchial authority over the state.

====Africa====
Hertzog of South Africa, whose National Party had won the 1929 election alone, after splitting with the Labour Party, received much of the blame for the devastating economic impact of the depression.

====Americas====

*Canada and other countries under the [[British Empire]] sign the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931, establishing effective parliamentary independence of Canada from the parliament of the United Kingdom.
*[[United States Marine Corps]] general [[Smedley Butler]] confesses to the U.S. Congress in 1934 that a group of industrialists contacted him, requesting his aid to overthrow the U.S. government of Roosevelt and establish what he claimed would be a fascist regime in the United States.
*[[1939 New York World's Fair]], USA displays the pavilions showing art, culture and technology from the whole world.
*[[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] voluntarily returns to British colonial rule in 1934 amid its economic crisis during the Great Depression with the creation of the [[Commission of Government]], a non-elected body.
*[[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|W. L. Mackenzie King]] meets with German [[Führer]] [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1937 in Berlin. King is the only North American head of government to meet with Hitler.
* [[Amelia Earhart]] receives major attention in the 1930s as the first woman pilot to conduct major air flights. Her disappearance for unknown reasons in 1937 while on flight prompted search efforts which failed.
* Southern [[Great Plains]] devastated by decades-long [[Dust Bowl]]
* In 1932, the Polish [[Cipher Bureau]] broke the German Enigma cipher and overcame the ever-growing structural and operating complexities of the evolving [[Enigma machine]] with [[plugboard]], the main German cipher device during [[World War II]].
* [[Board of Temperance Strategy]] established in U.S. to fight [[repeal of prohibition]]
* [[Getúlio Vargas]] became the President of Brazil after the [[Revolution of 1930|1930 coup d'état]].

====Asia====
[[File:Marche sel.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mohandas Gandhi]] on the [[Salt Satyagraha|Salt March]] in 1930.]]
* Major international media attention follows [[Mohandas Gandhi]]'s [[Nonviolent resistance|peaceful resistance]] movement against the British colonial rule in India.
*[[Chinese Communist Party]] leader [[Mao Zedong]] forms the small enclave state called the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]] in 1931.
*The [[Gandhi–Irwin Pact]] is signed by Mohandas Gandhi and [[Viceroy of India]], [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]] on March 5, 1931. Gandhi agrees to end the campaign of [[civil disobedience]] being carried out by the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) in exchange for Irwin accepting the INC to participate in roundtable talks on British colonial policy in India.
*The [[Government of India Act 1935|Government of India Act of 1935]] is enacted by the [[Governor-General of India]], separating [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]] to become a separate British possession and also increasing the political autonomy of the remaining [[presidencies and provinces of British India]].
*Mao Zedong's Chinese communists begin a large retreat from advancing nationalist forces, called the [[Long March]], beginning in October 1934 and ending in October 1936 and resulting in the collapse of the Chinese Soviet Republic.
* Colonial India's [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] leader [[Muhammed Ali Jinnah]] delivers his "[[Day of Deliverance (India)|Day of Deliverance]]" speech on December 2, 1939, calling upon [[Muslims]] to begin to engage in civil disobedience against the British colonial government starting on December 12. Jinnah demands redress and resolution to tensions and violence occurring between Muslims and [[Hindus]] in India. Jinnah's actions are not supported by the largely Hindu-dominated [[Indian National Congress]] whom he had previously closely allied with. The decision is seen as part of an agenda by Jinnah to support the eventual creation of an independent Muslim state called [[Pakistan]] from British Empire.

====Australia====
*Australia and New Zealand sign the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931 which established legislative equality between the self-governing [[dominion]]s of the [[British Empire]] and the United Kingdom, with a few residual exceptions. The [[Parliament of Australia]] and [[Parliament of New Zealand]] gain full legislative authority over their territories, no longer sharing powers with the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].

== Disasters ==
* The [[1931 China floods|China floods of 1931]] was one of the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded.
[[File:Hindenburg disaster.jpg|thumb|right|The German [[dirigible]] [[airship]] [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|''Hindenburg'']] exploding in 1937.]]
[[File:Dust-storm-Texas-1935.png|thumb|The [[Dust Bowl]] dust storm approaches [[Stratford, Texas]], in 1935.]]
*The [[1935 Labor Day Hurricane]] makes landfall in the Florida Keys as a category 5 hurricane; it was the most intense hurricane to ever make landfall in the Atlantic basin. It caused an estimated $6 million (1935 USD) in damages, and killed around 408 people. The hurricane's strong winds and storm surge destroyed nearly all of the structures between [[Tavernier, Florida|Tavernier]] and [[Marathon, Florida|Marathon]], and the town of [[Islamorada]] was obliterated. 
* The German [[dirigible]] [[airship]] [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|''Hindenburg'']] explodes in the sky above [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]], United States on May 6, 1937. 36 people are killed. The event leads to an investigation of the explosion and the disaster causes major public distrust of the use of [[hydrogen]]-inflated airships and seriously damages the reputation of the [[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin|Zeppelin company]].
* The [[New London School explosion|New London School]] in [[New London, Texas]], is destroyed by an explosion, killing in excess of 300 students and teachers (1937).
* The [[New England Hurricane of 1938]], which became a Category 5 hurricane before making landfall as a Category 3. The hurricane was estimated to have caused property losses estimated at US$306 million ($4.72 billion in 2010), killed between 682 and 800 people, and damaged or destroyed over 57,000 homes, including famed actress [[Katharine Hepburn]]'s, who had been staying in her family's [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]], beach home when the hurricane struck.

===Fashion===
{{Main|1930–45 in fashion}}

The most characteristic North American fashion trend from the 1930s to 1945 was attention at the shoulder, with butterfly sleeves and banjo sleeves, and exaggerated shoulder pads for both men and women by the 1940s. The period also saw the first widespread use of man-made fibers, especially [[rayon]] for dresses and [[viscose]] for [[lining (sewing)|linings]] and [[lingerie]], and synthetic [[nylon]] [[stocking]]s. The [[zipper]] became widely used. These essentially U.S. developments were echoed, in varying degrees, in Britain and Europe. Suntans (called at the time "sunburns") became fashionable in the early 1930s, along with travel to the resorts along the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], in the [[Bahamas]], and on the east coast of [[Florida]] where one can acquire a tan, leading to new categories of clothes: white dinner jackets for men and beach pajamas, halter tops, and bare midriffs for women.&lt;ref name="Mode"&gt;Wilcox, R. Turner: ''The Mode in Fashion'', 1942; rev. 1958, pp. 328–36, 379–84&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashion trendsetters in the period included [[Edward VIII|The Prince of Wales]] (King Edward VIII from January 1936 until his [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication]] that December) and his companion [[Wallis Simpson]] (the Duke and Duchess of Windsor from their marriage in June 1937), socialites like [[Nicolas de Gunzburg]], [[Daisy Fellowes]] and [[Mona von Bismarck]] and such [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood]] [[movie star]]s as [[Fred Astaire]], [[Carole Lombard]] and [[Joan Crawford]].

{{See also|Social Realism|History of painting}}

[[Social Realism]] became an important [[art movement]] during the [[Great Depression]] in the United States in the 1930s. Social realism generally portrayed imagery with socio-political meaning. Other related American artistic movements of the 1930s were [[American scene painting]] and [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] which were generally depictions of rural America, and historical images drawn from American history. [[Precisionism]] with its depictions of industrial America was also a popular art movement during the 1930s in the USA. During the Great Depression the art of [[photography]] played an important role in the Social Realist movement. The work of [[Dorothea Lange]], [[Walker Evans]], [[Margaret Bourke-White]], [[Lewis Hine]], [[Edward Steichen]], [[Gordon Parks]], [[Arthur Rothstein]], [[Marion Post Wolcott]], [[Doris Ulmann]], [[Berenice Abbott]], [[Aaron Siskind]], [[Russell Lee (photographer)|Russell Lee]], [[Ben Shahn]] (as a photographer) among several others were particularly influential.

The [[Works Progress Administration]] part of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration|Roosevelt Administration]]'s [[New Deal]] sponsored the [[Federal Art Project]], the [[Public Works of Art Project]], and the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]] which employed many American artists and helped them to make a living during the [[Great Depression]].

[[Mexican muralism]] was a [[Mexican art]] movement that took place primarily in the 1930s. The movement stands out historically because of its political undertones, the majority of which of a [[Marxist]] nature, or related to a social and political situation of post-revolutionary Mexico. Also in Latin America [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Magic Realism]] were important movements.

In Europe during the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], [[Surrealism]], late [[Cubism]], the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], [[Dada]], [[German Expressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[modernist]] painting in various guises characterized the art scene in Paris and elsewhere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9240">'''American Council for Cultural Policy''' ('''ACCP''') was a not-for-profit organization formed in 2002 by a group of politically influential antiquities dealers, collectors and lawyers in the [[United States]], with its headquarters in [[New York City|New York]] and representatives in [[Washington D.C.]]. The goal of the organization was described by Ashton Hawkins as "informing the public on arts issues." &lt;ref&gt;Ashton Hawkins, "Preface" in Who Owns the Past? Cultural Policy, Cultural Property and the Law. Kate Fitz Gibbon, ed.
New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, co-published with the
American Council for Cultural Policy, 2005: p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is now defunct and its website (culturalpolicycouncil.org) has been removed from the web. Some of its members now actively take part in [https://sites.google.com/a/cprinst.org/www/ Cultural Policy Research Institute].

The organization has been famous for its views on heritage issues and advocating the lawful circulation of antiquities in a regulated trade that balances the interests of national heritage, archeological preservation and the international interest in cultural exchange by museum loans and the private market. ACCP's treasurer William Pearlstein has described Middle Eastern cultural heritage laws (especially those of Iraq) as "retentionist" and expressed a desire for the possibility of circulation of licensed exported antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lawler, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/299/5607/643.pdf "Impending War Stokes Battle Over Fate of Iraqi Antiquities"] (''Science'' 31 January 2003: Vol. 299. no. 5607, p. 643)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some [[Archaeologist]]s, academics, and cultural heritage lawyers have found these statements worrisome, as the members of ACCP are politically influential figures. [[Archaeological Institute of America]]'s [http://www.archaeological.org/pdfs/AIA_Code_of_EthicsA5S.pdf code of ethics] maintain that its members "refuse to participate in the trade in undocumented antiquities and refrain from activities that enhance the commercial value of such objects. Undocumented antiquities are those that are not documented as belonging to a public or private collection before December 30, 1970 when the AIA Council endorsed the [http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO Convention on Cultural Property], or that have not been excavated and exported from the country of origin in accordance with the laws of that country." (Source: [http://www.archaeological.org AIA official webpage]) It is widely believed by many academics that the trade and collectorship of antiquities fuel the looting and destruction of archaeological sites around the world.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Colin Renfrew, ''Loot, legitimacy and ownership: the ethical crisis in archaeology''. London: Duckworth, 2000. Also more recently Neil Brodie and Colin Renfrew, "[http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.anthro.34.081804.120551 Looting and the world's archaeological heritage: the inadequate response]" ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' 34 (2005) 43-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and the structure of the group==

According to published news reports and its [http://www.culturalpolicycouncil.org/ own website], the ACCP was directed by Ashton Hawkins, former executive vice-president and Counsel to the Trustees of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. The group had its inaugural meeting with a 45-people Board of Advisers on 9 October 2002. According to an Art Newspaper article (see below), among them were the antiquities collector Shelby White (see [[Leon Levy]]), the former Getty curator Arthur Houghton (a vice-president), the former [[Kimbell Art Museum]] director Edmund Pillsbury, and the legal scholar Prof John Merryman. Several lawyers from major museums were also there. William Pearlstein was the treasurer of the group and has also represented the National Association of Dealers in Ancient, Oriental and Primitive Art. 

Ashton Hawkins, former lawyer of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and current president of ACCP was reported in the Art Newspaper article as stating the following: "We believe that legitimate dispersal of cultural material through the market is one of the best ways to protect it. We're interested in the protection of culture as much as the protection of legitimate collecting.".&lt;ref&gt;See David D'Arcy, "Legal group to fight "retentionist" policies." [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/ ''Art Newspaper''].  October 24, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACCP's board of directors included President Ashton Hawkins, Vice President Arthur Houghton, Treasurer William Pearlstein, Educational coordinator Kate Fitz Gibbon and Secretary Arielle Kozloff.

==American invasion of Iraq and activities of ACCP==
The council appeared in the forefront of cultural heritage protection debates during the American [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. A 2003 article in [[Science (journal)|Science]] discusses Ashton and Pearlstein's advocacy for "liberalization" in the issuance of foreign-dig permits in Iraq and reconsideration of Iraqi cultural heritage laws to allow “some objects [to be] certified for export."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/299/5607/643.pdf Andrew Lawler, "Impending War Stokes Battle Over Fate of Iraqi Antiquities"] (''Science'' 31 January 2003: Vol. 299. no. 5607, p. 643)&lt;/ref&gt;  On ACCP's activities concerning Iraqi [[cultural heritage]], Zainab Bahrani’s article [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20030526/bahrani "Looting and Conquest"] &lt;ref&gt;The Nation, May 26, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; takes a critical counter-position. Bahrani wrote that “William Pearlstein, of the American Council for Cultural Policy (ACCP), an organization that met with the [[White House]] and [[the Pentagon]] right before the [Iraq] war and right after the looting [of the [[National Museum of Iraq]]], is appealing for the cultural theft to continue by other means, calling Iraq's antiquities-preservation laws "retentionist," and saying he "hoped that Iraq would grant more excavation permits and consider export permits for redundant objects." She adds that such “opportunism opens the door to more cultural and historical plunder, a base scramble much like the parceling off of sites and antiquities that occurred in the nineteenth century.”

==Publications==
ACCP Advisory Board member Kate Fitz Gibbon, who served on the Cultural Property Advisory Committee to the US President from 2000—2003, has recently edited a book entitled ''Who owns the past: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law'' (Rutgers University Press 2005), which mostly features contributors affiliated with ACCP (e.g. William Pearlstein, Shelby White, Kate Fitz Gibbon etc.), and intends to propagate the legitimacy of "the ability of museums and private collectors [in the US] to own art from other countries" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://165.230.98.36/acatalog/______________168.html |title=Rutgers U.P. book description |access-date=2006-08-15 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20061013122530/http://165.230.98.36/acatalog/______________168.html |archive-date=2006-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the public opinion. Jean M. Borgatti (Clark University) published a favorable account of this book on [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=241191143482611 H-Net reviews]. According to Borgatti, the book in the overall sense critiques what they call "retentive cultural nationalisms" of "source-nations" who insist that archaeological artifacts should remain in the country of origin. The authors of the book present themselves as "cultural internationalists" who consider ancient artifacts as works of art that need to be circulated (in the antiquities market, Western museums, among Western collectors) to promote a "cultural understanding". 

Cultural property is internationally protected by the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] and the [http://www.unesco.org/culture/laws/1970/html_eng/page1.shtml UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4097">The '''amice''' is a liturgical [[vestment]] used mainly in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church, [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church, some [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches, and [[Armenian Catholic|Armenian]] and [[Polish National Catholic Church|Polish National Catholic]] churches.

==Description==
The amice consists of a white cloth connected to two long ribbon-like attachments, by which it is fastened around the shoulders of the priest. Before the liturgical reforms of 1972, its use was mandatory for all Roman Catholic [[Roman Mass|masses]], but it is only required today if the [[alb]] does not cover the [[priest|priest's]] ordinary clothing. Many priests choose to wear the amice for reasons of tradition or to prevent damage to their other [[vestment]]s due to perspiration.

Certain mendicant orders, such as the Dominicans and Franciscans, and some other orders with hooded habits, often donned the amice over the raised hood. The priest, or minister, then fastened the ribbons – crossed at the chest – behind his chest. The alb was donned over the hood and amice, and fastened. The hood/amice could then be retracted neatly around the collar.

In several Mediaeval uses, such as the [[Sarum Rite]], the amice bore a broad stiff band of brocade or other decoration, giving the impression of a high collar. These were called ''apparelled amices''. This practice was abandoned at Rome at about the end of the 15th century, but continued in other parts of Europe until much later. By 1907, however, the practice was no longer tolerated in Roman Catholic liturgy, but still exists within many [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] communities and in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Church of Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.svenskakyrkan.se/vasterasstift/prastens-skrud|title=Prästens skrud|trans-title=|language=|website=SvenskaKyrkan.se|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibblansvarar.se/svar/vad-heter-det-veta-som-praster|title=Vad kallas det vita präster har runt halsen?|trans-title=|language=|website=BibblanSvarar.se|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This collar-like amice spread to the [[Armenian Orthodox|Armenian Church]], where is retained as a normal part of the priestly vestments among the [[Armenian Orthodox]].

While donning the amice, the priest first drapes the amice over his head (as with a hood), then lowers it to his neck, tying it around his torso. During this action he prays a short prayer asking God to clothe him with the "helmet of salvation".

== Career ==

=== England ===
He left the navy in 1983, and the following year he began a [[Master of Letters]] in Maritime Studies at [[St. Andrews University]], a course which combined history with maritime archaeology.&lt;ref name=KonstamPDF/&gt; After completing his Masters thesis on Renaissance Naval Artillery, he found a job in 1985 as a supervisor on an excavation in the [[River Thames]] near the [[Tower of London]], paid for by the [[Royal Armouries]].&lt;ref name=KonstamPDF/&gt; While he was working in the Royal Armouries, The Tower and the Kremlin decided to swap exhibits – a "Treasures of the Tower" being shown in Moscow while "Treasures of the Kremlin" came to London.&lt;ref name=KonstamPDF/&gt; At the same time the curators of both museums were encouraged to exchange information, and to examine each other's collections.&lt;ref name=KonstamPDF/&gt; This ended up with Konstam studying the 18th century [[Russian military]].&lt;ref name=KonstamPDF/&gt; A mutual colleague introduced him to a historian working for [[Osprey Publishing]], who turned out to want someone to write a book about [[Peter the Great]]'s Army.&lt;ref name=KonstamPDF/&gt; The result was two small (15,000-word) books which first appeared in 1993 – the first easily  accessible account of the foundation of the Russian army to appear in English.&lt;ref name=KonstamPDF/&gt;&lt;ref name=PTG&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Konstam, Angus |author2=Rickman, Dave | title=Peter the Great's Army | year=1993 | publisher=Osprey Publishing | location= | isbn=978-1-85532-315-5 | pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antonio de Capmany y Montpalau''' (24 November 1742{{snd}}Cadis, Andalusia, 14 November 1813), [[Spain|Spanish]] polygraph.

==Life==
He was born at [[Barcelona]], and studied logic and humanities at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]-run College of Bishops in Barcelona. He entered the army and took part in the [[Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762)|1762 Spanish campaign in Portugal]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

He retired from the army in 1770, and was subsequently elected secretary of the [[Real Academia de la Historia|Royal Academy of History]] in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Capmany y Montpalau, Antonio de|volume=5|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected deputy for the [[Principality of Catalonia]] by the [[Cádiz Cortes]], one of 51 deputies of Catalonia in the Constituent Assembly.

Capmany died at Barcelona on 14 November 1813. His monograph on the history of his birthplace still preserves much of its original value.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

A portrait of Antonio de Campmany, by Modesto Texidor, can be found in the Consulate Room at the Llotja School in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.es/preview/2008/06/08/pagina-7/71589460/pdf.html "Multinacionales en la Llotja"], "La Vanguardia", 8 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He married Gertrudis Marqui in Seville in 1769.

==Works==
His principal works are:
*''Memorias históricas sobre la marina, commercio, y artes de la antigua ciudad de Barcelona'' (4 vols 1779–1792)
*''Teatro histórico-critico de la elocuencia Española'' (1786)
*''Filosofía de la elocuencia'' (1776)
*''Cuestiones críticas sobre varios puntos de historia económica, política, y militar'' (1807)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9140">[[Image:Arthur navy.jpg|thumb|250px|Photograph of Arthur Posnansky from ''Campaña del Acre: la lancha "Iris"; aventuras y peregrinaciones'']] '''Arthur Posnansky''' (1873&amp;ndash;1946), often called "Arturo", was at various times in his life an engineer, explorer, ship’s navigator, director of a river navigation company, entrepreneur, La Paz city council member, and well known and well respected avocational [[archaeologist]]. During his lifetime, Posnansky was known as a prolific writer and researcher and for his active participation in the defense and development of [[Bolivia]]. He is well known for his books, including ''Tihuanacu, the Cradle of American Man'', ''Campana de Acre, La Lancha "Iris"'', ''Die Osterinsel und ihre praehistorischen Monumente'', and ''Razas y Monumentos Prehistóricos del Altiplano Andino''.&lt;ref name="Parker1922a"&gt;Parker, W.B. (1922) ''Bolivians of To-Day'', 2nd ed. The Hispanic Society of America. New York, New York. 332 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of Bolivia, where he is still widely read, Posnansky's writings about the [[Tiwanaku]] Site have also been made popular by authors such as [[Graham Hancock]], [[Charles Hapgood]], and [[Cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis|Rand Flem-Ath]], who rely on Posnansky's dating of the Tiwanaku Site to support their theories.

== Early life ==
He was born in Vienna, [[Austria]], on April 13, 1873.&lt;ref name="Stanish2002a"&gt;Stanish, C. (2002) ''Chapter 6 Tiwanaku Political Economy.'' in W.H. Isbell and H. Silverman, eds., pp. 169-198. Andean Archaeology I Variations in Sociopolitical Organization. Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishers, New York, New York. 394 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; He helped his father in his business as a manufacturing chemist. At this time, he was deeply involved in cognate studies. His interest in cognate studies ended when his father suddenly died. After his father's death, Posnansky studied at the Imperial and Royal Academy of Pola (now Pula) for the position of Naval Military Engineer in the Austro-Hungarian Navy. During his time in the Imperial and Royal Academy of Pola, he made several extensive training voyages, which took him many places, including the [[Easter Islands]] in the South [[Pacific Ocean]], as a part of his shipboard training. While on Easter Island, he made ethnological observations, which he later published as ''Die Osterinsel und ihre praehistorischen Monumente''. Posnansky graduated from the Imperial and Royal Academy of Pola at age 18.&lt;ref name="Parker1922a"/&gt;

== Life in Brazil ==
At age 23 in 1896, Posnansky emigrated to [[South America]]. At first, he participated in various expeditions, which explored upper reaches of the [[Amazon River]]. During these expeditions, he became an experienced navigator of it and its tributaries. He used his expertise to become the director of a river navigation company, which was called ''La Empresa de Navegacao dos rios Purus e Acre''. As captain and owner of the shallow-draught steamer and [[blockade runner]], ''Iris'', Posnansky rescued the survivors of the Acre garrison during the Acre Campaign in [[Brazil]]. This military campaign involved a dispute between [[Bolivia]] and Brazil over {{convert|191,000|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}} of territory on the [[Acre River]]. After being wounded and captured by Brazilian forces, he escaped and became a refugee in Europe. Because of his loyalty to and support of Bolivia in this conflict, he lost all of his properties in Brazil. His exploits during the Acre Campaign (1900-1901) are detailed in his book ''Campaña del Acre: la lancha "Iris"; aventuras y peregrinaciones''&lt;ref name="Parker1922a"/&gt;

==Life in Bolivia==
After being a refugee in Europe, Posnansky moved to Bolivia to claim compensation for his services to this country. After finding that any substantial reward was unattainable because of the bankrupt state of the Bolivian treasury, he devoted his talents towards building private businesses involved in mining and international trade. In time, he became a prosperous entrepreneur. During this time, Posnansky introduced the first car to Bolivia.&lt;ref name="Parker1922a"/&gt; Posnansky died in La Paz, Bolivia in 1946.

While his business ventures thrived, the Bolivian Government recognized Posnansky's service during the Acre Campaign. For his sacrifices  in support of the Bolivian government, it first granted him the honorific title of ''Benemerito de la Patria'' (''Worthy of the Nation'') and full Bolivian citizenship. Later, it awarded him two gold medals, one in 1901, the other in 1903. In 1905, his government service continued when he was elected to La Paz City Council.&lt;ref name="Parker1922a"/&gt;

==Scientific research==
[[Image:Bennet Posnansky.JPG|thumb|200px| Arthur Posnansky with archaeologist Wendell Bennett]]After settling in Bolivia, Posnansky repeatedly traveled the Bolivian and Peruvian highlands in efforts to locate, describe, and study Inca and pre-Inca archaeological sites. He was especially interested in those found along the shoreline and on the islands of [[Lake Titicaca]]. The results of these investigations were published in books such as ''The Islands of Titicaca and Koati'' and ''Rasas y monumentos prehistoricos del Altiplano Andino''. For such research, the Bolivian Senate awarded him a gold medal in 1905 and he later became Director of the National Museum. He also authored books, which included ''Os Indios Paumaris e Ipurinas no rio Purus'' (1898) and ''Mapa del rio Acre'' (7 volumes, 1897), about South American geography and ethnology. He also lectured about archaeological subjects in Berlin, Frankfort, Nuremberg, and Treptow, Germany. In recognition of his accomplishments, the German Government conferred on him an honorary title of Professor in 1914.&lt;ref name="Parker1922a"/&gt;

Posnansky's final and most important book, ''Tihuanacu, the Cradle of American Man,''&lt;ref name=" Posnansky(1945a)"&gt;Posnansky, A. (1945) ''Tihuanacu, the Cradle of American Man, Vols. I - II.'' (Translated into English by James F. Sheaver), J. J. Augustin, Publ., New York and Minister of Education, La Paz, Bolivia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Posnansky(1957a)"&gt;Posnansky, A. (1957) ''Tihuanacu, the Cradle of American Man, Vols. II - IV.'' (Translated into English by James F. Sheaver), J. J. Augustin, Publ., New York and Minister of Education, La Paz, Bolivia.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1945 (volumes I and II) and 1957 (volumes III and IV). In it, Posnansky argued that [[Tiwanaku]] was constructed approximately 15,000 BC&lt;ref name = "Posnansky1945"&gt;{{Citation | last = Posnansky | first = A | year = 1945 | title = Tihuanacu, the Cradle of American Man | volume = I–II | others = James F.

III–IV, La Paz, Bolivia: Minister of Education&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=December 2017}} by American peoples, although not by the ancestors of those then living in the area, the Aymara.  Posnansky also saw Tiwanaku as the origin point of civilization throughout the Americas, including the Inca, the Maya and others. Since the publication of the work, these ideas have since been discredited by later archaeological research.&lt;ref name = "Kelleyothers2002"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Kelley | first1 = D.H. | first2 = E.F. | last2 = Milone | year = 2002 | title = Exploring Ancient Skies: An Encyclopedic Survey of Archaeoastronomy | place = New York | publisher = Springer Science+Business | page=460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolata1993a"&gt;Kolata, A.L. (1993) ''Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization.'' Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge, United Kingdom. 256 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolata1996a"&gt;Kolata, A.L.

(2003) ''Tiwanaku and Its Hinterland: Archaeology and Paleoecology of an Andean Civilization'', vol. 2. Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the photographs, detailed descriptions of structures and inscriptions, meticulously prepared maps, and numerous photographs found in this work constitute an extremely valuable historical record of the site. Posnansky's ideas about Tiwanaku having been a full-fledged city with a large permanent population, rather than only a seasonally occupied ceremonial center, and its abandonment having been the result of prehistoric climatic change are widely accepted in principle. This book and his personal efforts also contributed significantly to the eventual preservation of the site at a time when it was being very badly damaged by neglect, stone-quarrying, and looting.&lt;ref name="Stanish2002a"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4189">Dr. '''Arturo Morales Carrión''',  as Gov. [[Rafael Hernández Colón]] eulogized him, "one of the principal figures" in the history of Puerto Rico.  Born November 16, 1913 in Havana, Cuba, of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] parentage, he died in June, 1989 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, after having served under Gov. [[Luis Muñoz Marín]] as Under Secretary of State of Puerto Rico, under President [[John F. Kennedy]] as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/30/obituaries/dr-arturo-morales-carrion-75-top-aide-in-kennedy-state-dept.html&lt;/ref&gt; as special assistant to the Secretary General of the [[Organization of American States]] and as president of the [[University of Puerto Rico]].

==Early life==

Born in Havana of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] parents, he studied at the Vila Mayo High School, and graduated in 1931 from the [[University of Puerto Rico High School|University High School]] (UHS), the alma mater of many prominent Puerto Ricans, before obtaining a B. A. degree, majoring in History and Political Science from UPR in 1935.  He obtained an M.A. in Latin American Studies from the [[University of Texas]] at Austin in 1936 and, later in life, obtained his Ph.D. in History and Government from [[Columbia University]] in 1950.  In 1948 he married Inés Arandes Rexach, with whom he had two sons, Arturo and Edgardo, and one daughter, Inés Morales Arandes.

==Public life==

In 1953, Gov. Muñoz and Secretary of State [[Roberto Sánchez Vilella]] appointed Morales Carrión as Under Secretary of State, the position held for eleven of the past 22 years by [[José Rodríguez Suárez]], and a post he held until 1961 for eight years.  During that period, he spearheaded efforts to provide technical assistance to neighboring nations and promoting cultural exchanges.

In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Dr. Morales Carrión as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs until 1964, and helped organize the [[Alliance for Progress]] led by a fellow Puerto Rican, [[Teodoro Moscoso]].

From 1964 to 1969, he served as Special Assistant to the Secretary General of the OAS.

Back in Puerto Rico, in 1973, he was chosen as President of UPR, a post he held until 1977.  At UPR, he had earlier been chairman of its History Department, founded decades ago by Dr. [[Pilar Barbosa]].  At UPR, and as its president, he created the Center for Historic Research.  He also founded the Puerto Rico Foundation of the Humanities and served as its Executive Director until his death in 1989.

Throughout his life, he served as Visiting Professor at innumerable institutions of higher learning, including [[Harvard University]]. Columbia University, [[George Washington University]] and the [[University of Miami]], as well as other universities in the Caribbean and Latin America.

==Honors and recognitions==

Thirteen years after his death, the [[Interamerican University of Puerto Rico]] published a 1,000-plus page biography of Morales Carrión, edited by professor [[Héctor Luis Acevedo]], that was presented at the Puerto Rico State Department on Nov. 14, 2012, with [[Acting Governor]] [[Kenneth McClintock]] offering remarks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12069">[[File:Bulgarian Asen dynasty monument Veliko Tarnovo Klearchos.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Monument to the Asen dynasty in their capital [[Veliko Tarnovo]], [[Bulgaria]], sculptor prof. Krum Damianov]]

The '''Asen dynasty''' ({{lang-bg|Асеневци}}, ''Asenevtsi'') founded and ruled a medieval [[Bulgaria]]n state, called in modern historiography the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], between 1187 and 1256.

The Asen dynasty rose as the leaders of Bulgaria after a [[Uprising of Asen and Peter|rebellion]] against the [[Byzantine Empire]] at the turn of the year 1185/1186 caused by the increase in the Imperial taxes.

Early rulers from the Asen dynasty (particularly [[Kaloyan]]) referred to themselves as "[[Emperor]]s of Bulgarians and [[Vlachs]]". Later rulers, especially the successful [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]], styled themselves "[[Tsar]]s ([[Emperor]]s) of Bulgarians and Greeks".

Some members of the Asen family entered Byzantine service in the thirteenth to fourteenth centuries. The name also occurs as a family name in modern Greek, and could go back to the same name.

==Origins==
[[File:Asen dynasty.png|280px|right|thumb|Genealogy of the Asen dynasty]]

The origins of the dynasty, especially the ethnic background of the three Asen brothers ([[Theodore Peter of Bulgaria|Teodor I Peter IV]], [[Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen I]] and [[Kaloyan]]) are still a source of much controversy, debated among historians. There are three main hypothesis regarding their origins:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum08|Humanitas 2008]]: 4&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Cumans|Cuman]]''' origin, as some of the names in the dynasty, including Asen, are derived from [[Cuman language]]. Groups of Cumans settled and mingled with the local population in many regions of the Balkans between the 10th and 13th centuries and founded also other successive Bulgarian dynasties ([[Terterids]] and [[Shishman dynasty|Shishmanids]]).&lt;ref name="István Vásáry 2005 p. 2"&gt;István Vásáry (2005) ''Cumans and Tatars'', Cambridge University Press, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Early Inner Asia pg 279"&gt;The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia, Volume 1, Denis Sinor, pg 279.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ion Grumeza, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DTxu6RxdecUC&amp;pg=PA51 The Roots of Balkanization: Eastern Europe C.E. 500-1500] (2010), p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bulgarian Folk Customs pg 27"&gt;Bulgarian Folk Customs, Mercia MacDermott, pg 27&lt;/ref&gt;  
# '''[[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]]''' origin, a view that is common among the Bulgarian historians who reckon that all native sources (from the 13th century{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=12}}) use predominantly the terms Bulgaria, Bulgarians and Bulgarian, that tsar Kaloyan claimed provenance from the rulers of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume Three: Shared Pasts, Disputed Legacies
Balkan Studies Library, Roumen Daskalov, Alexander Vezenkov, Publisher	BRILL, 2015, {{ISBN|9004290362}}, pp. 289-316.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Vlachs|Vlach]]''' origin,&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Runciman]]. [[A History of the Crusades]] ([https://books.google.com/books?id=mrw8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 page 13])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stephenson, ''Byzantium's Balkan Frontier: A Political Study of the Northern Balkans, 900-1204'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0521027564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boldur Alexandru, Istoria Basarabiei, Editura Frunza, Bucuresti, 1990, p 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madgearu, Alexandru (2014). Asăneștii. Istoria politico-militara a statului dinastiei Asan (1185-1280). Târgoviște: Cetatea de Scaun. {{ISBN|9786065372276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a view supported mainly by Romanian and some foreign historians who base their claims on Byzantine sources, Western Crusade chronicles, and letters between [[Pope Innocent III]] and [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]].{{sfn|Wolff|1949|p=178, 180, 185, 190, 198}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=12}}


In their own administrative documents and correspondence, the three rulers viewed themselves as descendants and successors of the Bulgarian Tsars [[Samuil of Bulgaria|Samuil]], [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter I]] and [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]], and the state they founded as a continuation of the First Bulgarian Empire. However, this could be just a way to proclaim their legitimacy for the throne of the Empire.

In a correspondence, of 1199, the Pope talks about the "Roman descent" of Kaloyan. However, considering the actual text says ''Nos autem audito quod de nobili urbis Romae prosapia progenitores tui originem traxerint'' ("We heard that your forefathers come from a noble family from the city of Rome"), it is usually dismissed as simply a hidden compliment of the Pope to Kaloyan.

Pope Innocent III in his letter to the Bulgarian King Kaloyan (Calojoannes) in 1204 addressed him "King of Bulgarians and Vlachs" (''rex Bulgarorum et Blachorum''); in answering the Pope, John called himself ''imperator omnium Bulgarorum et Blachorum'' ("Emperor of all Bulgarians and Vlachs'), but signed himself ''imperator Bulgariae Calojoannes'' ("Emperor Kaloyan of Bulgaria"); besides, the archbishop of Veliko Tarnovo called himself ''totius Bulgariae et Blaciae Primas'' ("Primate of all Bulgaria and Vlachia").

The Bulgarian historiography negate, while the Romanian highlight the role of the Vlachs in the uprising. However, the scientific debate reflects the nationalistic rivality from the 19-20th century, which did not exist in the 12-13th century. Vlachs and Bulgarian Slavs jointly inhabited Bulgaria, and both groups in sufferance were united against the common cause under a leader, regardless of the leader "race". The Asen brothers were associated with the Vlach population of the mountainous regions around Trnovo, [[Niketas Choniates]] recorded Vlach shamans during revolt exhibition, but nevertheless of their ethnicity, it was a joint venture of the Bulgarians, Vlachs and Cumans.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=12–13}}

=== Etymology ===
The name of the dynasty comes from one of the brothers, namely Asen I. The etymology is most likely of Cuman Turkic origin, derived from "esen" which meant "safe, sound, healthy" and the Belgun nickname seems to be derived from Turkic "bilgün", which meant "wise". Further support to this connection can be found in the charters of the [[Great Lavra (Athos)|Great Lavra]] of Mt. Athos from the end of the 12th century, which mention the monastery's problems with some of the Cuman stratiotes, where "Asen" is listed as the name of one of those Cumans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liternet.bg/publish13/p_pavlov/buntari/skitski.htm Plamen Pavlov - "Scythian chieftains in the fields of Bulgaria, 11th-12th century] (in Bulgarian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other study shows that the only name that makes sense is ''änish'' (descent) and the word can be found almost exclusively in the languages of the Kıpçak Turks&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri Korobeinikov, A broken mirror: the Kipçak world in the thirteenth century. In the volume: The other Europe from the Middle Ages, Edited by Florin Curta, Brill 2008, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

==Byzantine branch==
The Asens in Byzantium largely descend from Ivan Asen III, who ruled briefly as Emperor of Bulgaria before fleeing to Constantinople as [[Ivaylo of Bulgaria|Ivaylo]]'s uprising was gaining momentum in 1280. A ''despotes'' under [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]], Ivan Asen III had already been married to the Byzantine Emperor's eldest daughter, [[Irene Palaiologina, Empress of Bulgaria|Irene Palaiologina]]. The couple's five sons and two daughters were the progenitors of one of the highest-regarded Byzantine noble families of their time, along with the [[Palaiologoi]]. Among the Byzantine Asens, three bore the title of ''[[despot (court title)|despotes]]'', three that of ''[[sebastokrator]]'', two ''[[panhypersebastos]]'', one was a ''[[megas doux]]'' and two were titled ''[[megas primikerios]]''.&lt;ref name="bozilov20-22"&gt;Božilov, pp. 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek, the male form of the family name is rendered as Ἀσάνης (''Asanis'') and the female as Ασανίνα (''Asanina'').

A smaller branch descends from [[Elena Asenina of Bulgaria]], wife of Nicaean Emperor [[Theodore II Laskaris]].&lt;ref&gt;Božilov, pp. 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asens of Byzantium intermarried with other prominent noble dynasties, including the [[Kantakouzenos]], [[Doukas]], [[Laskaris]], [[Tornikios]] and [[Raoul (Byzantine family)|Raoul]] families. Notable members of the Asen family in the Byzantine Empire include:

* [[Andronikos Asen]], ''epitropos'' of the Morea (1316-1322)
* [[Irene Asanina]], Empress Consort of [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] (1347-1354)
* [[Matthew Kantakouzenos|Matthew Asen Kantakouzenos]], Co-Emperor of Byzantium (1353-1357)
* [[Matthew Palaiologos Asen]], Lord of Corinth (1454-1458)

===Byzantine Asens elsewhere===
From Byzantium, the Asens spread as far as [[Frankish Greece]], the [[Principality of Theodoro]], the [[Principality of Moldavia]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]].&lt;ref name="bozilov20-22"/&gt;

* [[Eudoxia Laskarina|Eudoxia Laskarina Asanina]] (1248-1311), Nicaean princess, Countess of Ventimiglia and Tende and nun in Aragon 
* [[Helena Asanina Kantakouzene]], Dowager Countess of Salona (1380-1394)
* [[Andronikos Asen Zaccaria]], Prince of Achaea (before 1386-1401)
* [[Thomas Asen Palaiologos]], exile in Naples and ''ktetor''
* [[Maria of Mangup|Maria Asanina Palaiologina]], Princess Consort of Moldavia (1472-1477)

'''Constantine Paparrigopoulos''' ({{lang-el|Κωνσταντίνος Παπαρρηγόπουλος}}; 1815 – 14 April 1891) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] historian, who is considered the founder of modern Greek [[historiography]]. He is the founder of the concept of historical continuity of [[Greece]] from antiquity to the present, establishing the tripartite division of [[History of Greece|Greek history]] in [[Ancient Greece|ancient]], [[Byzantine Greece|medieval]] and [[History of modern Greece|modern]], and sought to set aside the prevailing views at the time that the [[Byzantine Empire]] was a period of decadence and degeneration, not recognized as part of Greek history.

Paparrigopoulos introduced this division in his teaching at the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]]. His main work is the multi-volume ''History of the Greek Nation'' (''Ιστορία του Ελληνικού Έθνους''), covering the history of the [[Greeks]] from ancient to modern times, including the rediscovery of the Greek Middle Ages and their integration as part of the national history of Greece. He is also known for contradicting with robust arguments the controversial theories of [[Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer]] regarding the racial origins of the Greeks.

==Life==
[[File:Paparrigopoulos signature.jpg|thumb|The signature of Constantine Paparrigopoulos]]
Paparrigopoulos was born in [[Constantinople]] in 1815. His father, a native of [[Vytina]], was killed by the rabble of [[Constantinople]] when the [[Greek War of Independence]] erupted in 1821. Paparrigopoulos not only saw this grisly spectacle, but he also attended the execution of his brother, Michael, and of his two uncles. His mother who survived the slaughters fled to [[Odessa]], where Paparrigopoulos accomplished his studies as a bursar of the [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]].

In 1830 Paparrigopoulos travelled to Greece to study in the "Central School" (Κεντρικό Σχολείο) of Aegina, founded by the Greek leader [[John Capodistria|Ioannis Kapodistrias]]. He continued his studies in the universities of France and Germany.

Returning to Greece Paparrigopoulos was appointed in the ministry of Justice, but in 1845 he withdrew because he did not yet possess a Greek [[nationality]]. He was reappointed as a teacher when he obtained the Greek [[nationality]] (as a "[[Gortyna, Arcadia|Gortynian]]"). In 1851 he became a professor of history of the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]].

In 1873 Paparrigopoulos lost his beloved son and famous poet, [[Dimitrios Paparrigopoulos]]. In 1876 and 1884 the Greek state utilised him for national purposes, appointing him as president of the "National Defence" and as president of the "Exhibition of the relics of the War of Independence".

==Work==
In 1843, while working in the Ministry of Justice, Paparrigopoulos published his first survey, ''About the emigration of [[Slavic people|Slav]] tribes in [[Peloponnese]]'', contradicting with robust arguments&lt;ref&gt;[http://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/metadata/6/7/8/metadata-39-0000554.tkl Περί της εποικήσεως Σλαβικών τινών φυλών εις την Πελοπόννησον (in greek)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer|Fallmerayer's]] opinion that modern Greeks are of Slav descent, having no racial relation with the [[ancient Greeks]]. In 1844, he published his second survey, ''The last year of the Greek independence'', treating the fall of [[Corinth]]. In 1855 he gave his inaugural lecture as professor of the university, contradicting a theory that did not recognise the importance of the [[Dorians|Dorian]] influence on the civilization of ancient Greece.

Nonetheless, his monumental writing is the ''History of the Greek nation'', comprising 6 volumes, which were later complemented by [[Pavlos Karolidis]]. Paparrigopoulos published the first volume in 1860 and completed his work in 1877 with the last volume, which constituted a synopsis of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The best&lt;!--in what sense?--&gt; edition of the ''History of the Greek nation'' is the edition of Eleftheroudakis in 1925 with the application&lt;!--Is this intended to mean "notes"?--&gt; of Karolidis. In this work he adopted the tripartite examination of periods already introduced by [[Spyros Zampelios]] ([[ancient Greece|ancient Hellenism]], [[Byzantine Empire|medieval Hellenism]], [[History of Modern Greece|modern Hellenism]]) and used it as a tool for the narration of the course of the [[Greeks|Greek nation]] throughout the centuries.

==Assessments==

Paparrigopoulos is considered the "national" historian of modern Greece. In his ''History of the Greek Nation'', he regarded the history of [[Greece]] from the ancient years till nowadays as a unity, insisting on the continuity of the Greek nation. At the same time he promoted the importance of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and of the Byzantine history in general. Because of his profound surveys, the disdain towards the Byzantine history was limited.

The interpretation of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium's]] Greek character in the work of Sp. Zampelios was the first step in the effort to refute Fallmerayer's theory. It was supported that the ancient Greek civilization had not faded away, but had been creatively reshaped as it met Christianity, which took place during the Byzantine Empire. With Zampelios then, the foundations were prepared in order for a total national history to be written, in order for the past, the continuous course of the Greek nation from [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] till the 19th century, to be narrated. This ambitious project was undertaken and completed by Constantine Paparrigopoulos, who is considered for this reason the founder of Greek national historiography, also known as Greek historism.

Paparrigopoulos, as well as Sp. Zampelios set the basis for the formation of national identity in modern Greek society. Besides, their work did not concern only a closed and restricted circle of specialists and academics. It was addressed to the society of their times, in order to strengthen their national self-knowledge. Besides, Paparrigopoulos' classes at the University, which constituted the raw material for the writing of his memorable History, were frequently published in Pandora magazine, of which he was the co-publisher, as well as in the Athenian Press. The term Greek-Christian which was devised for scientific purposes, functioned towards the same direction but did not remain a simple instrument of analysis in the hands of specialists. As this term appeared in mid-ninth century exactly, it became a canvass on which the ideology of the Greek state was developed and shaped. The content of education, the orientation of historical studies and the study of tradition (folklore) were organized on this basis. In addition, the [[Megali Idea]] (Greek Great Idea) which was nebulous until that time, acquired flesh and bones. The Byzantine Empire, which had now been acclaimed a cultural mold of the Greek state which was still small, became the model for its territorial expansion.

Another great virtue of Paparrigopoulos is the elegance of his style and his literary charisma, which makes his texts readable and his narrations particularly vivid. His elegance is the main merit that places him higher than the other great modern Greek historian, Pavlos Karolidis.

Paparrigopoulos not only offered a united image of the history (ancient-medieval-modern) of the Greek nation, but, at the same time, he articulated in the most stirring way the pains and the dramas of the modern Hellenism.

He substantially extended and revised the work of [[Carl Meinhof]], his teacher, although he rejected some of Meinhof's theories only implicitly. Westermann is seen as one of the founders of modern [[Africa]]n linguistics. 

He carried out extensive linguistic and anthropological research in the area ranging from Senegal eastwards to the Upper Nile. His linguistic publications cover a wide range of African languages, including the [[Gbe languages]], [[Nuer language|Nuer]], [[Kpelle language|Kpelle]], [[Shilluk language|Shilluk]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], and [[Guang language|Guang]]. 

Westermann's comparative work, begun in 1911, initially brought together much of today's [[Niger–Congo]] and [[Nilo-Saharan]] language phyla under the name [[Sudanic languages]]. His most important later publication ''Die westlichen Sudansprachen'' [[1927a]] divided these into East and West [[Sudanic languages]] and laid the basis for what would become Niger–Congo. In this book and a series of associated articles between 1925 and 1928, Westermann both identified a large number of roots that form the basis of our understanding of Niger–Congo and set out the evidence for the coherence of many of the families that constitute it. Much of the classification of African languages associated with Joseph Greenberg actually derives from the work of Westermann.
 
In 1927 Westermann published a ''[[Africa Alphabet|Practical Orthography]] of [[African Languages]]'' which became later known as the ''Westermann script''. Subsequently he published the influential and oft-reprinted ''[[Practical Phonetics for Students of African Languages]]'' in collaboration with [[Ida C. Ward]] (1933).

He was born in [[Baden, Lower Saxony|Baden]] near [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] and also died there.

==Details and history==
Forced Entertainment originally focused on making and touring theatre performances before expanding to long durational performance, live art, video and digital media.&lt;ref name="mary-brennan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lyn-gardner-guardian-crazy" /&gt; Their work has been presented throughout the UK and Europe&lt;ref name="mary-brennan" /&gt; as well as Australia, Japan, Canada and the US.&lt;ref name="aesthetica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.britishcouncil.org/arts-performanceinprofile-2010-forced-entertainment.htm | accessdate = 27 October 2013 | title = Forced Entertainment - Performance in Profile 2010| publisher = British Council=|publisher british council=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hadera''' ({{lang-he-n|חֲדֵרָה}}, {{lang-ar|الخضيرة}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-Ḫuḍayrah&amp;#x202f;}}'', ''the green one'') is a city located in the [[Haifa District]] of [[Israel]], in the northern [[Sharon plain|Sharon]] region, approximately 45 kilometers (28&amp;nbsp;miles) from the major cities of [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Haifa]]. The city is located along 7&amp;nbsp;km (5&amp;nbsp;mi) of the [[Israeli coastal plain|Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain]]. The city's population includes a high proportion of immigrants arriving since 1990, notably from [[Ethiopia]] and the former [[Soviet Union]]. In {{Israel populations|Year}} it had a population of {{Israel populations|Hadera}}.{{Israel populations|reference}}

Hadera was established in 1891 as a farming colony by members of the Zionist group, [[Hovevei Zion]], from [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]]. By 1948, it was a regional center with a population of 11,800. In 1952, Hadera was declared a city, with jurisdiction over an area of 53,000 [[dunam]]s.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;

==History==
===Early years===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 5726 Pupils in Hadera.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jewish school]] in Hadera, 1931]]
[[File:Hadera's Great Synagogue.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hadera's Great Synagogue]]

Hadera was founded in [[1891]], in the early days of modern [[Zionism]] by [[Jewish]] immigrants from [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]] on land purchased by [[Yehoshua Hankin]], known as the Redeemer of the Valley.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jvl"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/geo/Hadera.html|title=Hadera|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land was purchased from a Christian [[effendi]], Selim Khuri. This was the largest purchase of land in [[Eretz Israel]] by a Zionist group, although the land was of low quality and mostly swampland. The only inhabitants prior to the purchase were a few families raising water buffaloes and selling reeds.&lt;ref name="dispossession"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud1xBeZZRDsC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=hadera&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=JzvmR_7ZJ42kzgSW38GbAQ&amp;sig=fhCGE6vGEXSfIzbu15DW7F94Vc4#PPA93,M1|title=The Claim of Dispossession: Jewish Land-Settlement and the Arabs, 1878-1948|page=93|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=0-87855-964-7|year=1984|accessdate=2008-10-25|last=Avneri|first= Aryeh L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town may derive its name from the [[Arabic]] word ''khadra'', meaning "green" in reference to the wild weeds which covered the marshes on which the town is built.&lt;ref name="jvl"/&gt; Historical geographer, Mordechai Eshel, citing a geographical work written in 1913, claims that the existing site whereon is now built Hadera was formerly called in Arabic ''Ǧadera'', being the site of the town, ''Gadera of Caesarea'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew:]] '''גדרה של קיסרין'''), mentioned in [[Tosefta]] ''Shevi'it'', ch. 7.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Eshel, [http://www.merchavim.022.co.il/BRPortal/br/P102.jsp?arc=931396 Notes of the author of "The Holy Land" on the books of his predecessors: "Tvu'ot HaAretz" and "Kaftor Va-Ferach", his novellae and errors in identifying sites] (Hebrew); cf. Isaac b. Eliyahu Pesach Goldhor, ''Adamat Kodesh - Being the Land of Israel after its Boundaries'', vol. 2, Jerusalem 1913, chapter 8 (p. 254) (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that the ancient Gadera should be identified with ''Tel Um Qeis''.

The first modern settlers lived in a house known as the Khan near Hadera's main synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JXoY2vCZ5AEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA60 |title=Israel and the Palestinian Territories: The Rough Guide|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=1-85828-248-9|author=Jacobs, Daniel|author2=Eber, Shirley |author3=Silvani, Fransesca |year=1998|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Hadera was a lonely outpost of 10 families and 4 guards. In its early years, however, the town had issues with land ownership having drained the swamps with the aid of Egyptian workers sent to them by [[Edmond James de Rothschild|Baron Edmond de Rothschild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gilbert, Martin|title=Israel, a History|year=1998|publisher=Morrow|isbn=0-688-12362-7|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old tombstones in the local cemetery reveal that out of a population of 540, 210 died of malaria.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVpg7eE2wFYC&amp;pg=PA532 |title=Israel Handbook|page=532|author=Winter, Dave|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|year=1999|isbn=1-900949-48-2|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore a Bible verse from the Psalms (Tehillim) was inscribed in the city's logo: "Those who sow in tears, will reap with songs of joy." (Ps 126:5)

Relations between the residents of Hadera and neighboring [[Bedouin]]s were poor and [[HaShomer]] organization was assigned to guarding the fields. By the early twentieth century, the town had become a regional economic center.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; Land disputes in the area were resolved by the 1930s, by which time, the population had grown to 2,002 in 1931.&lt;ref name="jvl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dispossession"/&gt; Free schooling was introduced in the city in 1937 in all schools apart from the [[Histadrut]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=itu-vLpwDS0C&amp;pg=PA255 |title=The Founding Myths of Israel: Nationalism, Socialism, and the Making of the Jewish State|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-00967-8|page=255|author=Sternhell, Zeev|authorlink=Zeev Sternhell|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 1948===
Hadera's population began to grow dramatically after Israeli independence in 1948 as immigrants flocked to the country. Among the immigrants to the city were Russian and other European immigrants and also 40 Yemenite families.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; In 1953, Israel's first paper mill opened in the town. Sponsored by investors from within Israel as well as from the [[United States]], [[Brazil]], and [[Australia]], the mill was designed to meet all of Israel's paper needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1953/12/18/archives/first-paper-mill-opened-in-israel-plant-at-hadera-is-expected-to.html|title=First Paper Mill Opened in Israel; Plant at Hadera is Expected to Help Nation Cut Currency Gap $1,000,000 a Year|publisher=New York Times|date=1953-12-18 |accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also at this time that the Givat Olga neighborhood was constructed on the coast, and Beit Eliezer in the east of the city. In 1964, Hadera was declared a city.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;

===From the 1990s===
[[File:Hadera, Israel - panoramio (4).jpg|thumb|250px|Shopping area in Hadera]]
The city grew dramatically during the 1990s as it absorbed large numbers of [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Ethiopia]]n immigrants.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jvl"/&gt; Hadera, considered a safe place by its inhabitants, was jolted by several acts of [[terrorism]], including a [[Bat Mitzvah massacre|massacre]] of six civilians at a Bat Mitzvah&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/bat--mitzvah-massacre-in-israel-leaves-seven-dead-663843.html Bat mitzvah massacre in Israel leaves seven dead], Phil Reeves, 18 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and a suicide bomber who blew himself up at a [[falafel]] stand on October 26, 2005, killing seven civilians,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Memorial/2005/Victims/Larisa_Gerashchenko|title=Larissa Grishchenko|work=GxMSDev}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3778335,00.html|title=Woman injured in Hadera terror attack dies 4 years later|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 55 were injured, of them five in severe condition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/suicide-bomber-rocks-hadera-market-1.172668|title=Suicide bomber rocks Hadera market|date=27 October 2005|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, four civilians were killed when a terrorist opened fire on pedestrians at a bus stop on October 28, 2001.&lt;ref name="mfa.gov.il"&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Palestinian+terror+since+2000/Victims+of+Palestinian+Violence+and+Terrorism+sinc.htm Victims of Palestinian Violence and Terrorism since September 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the construction of the nearby [[Israeli West Bank barrier|West Bank barrier]], the frequency of such incidents has dropped drastically. On August 4, 2006, three rockets fired by [[Hezbollah]] hit Hadera. Hadera is {{convert|50|mi|0}} south of the Lebanese border and marked the farthest point inside Israel hit by Hezbollah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3286401,00.html | title=For first time: Hizbullah targets Hadera area | date=2006-08-04 | accessdate=2008-11-30 | work=Ynet News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadera has traditionally been known as a backwater. However, in the 2000s, several projects were launched to improve the quality of life in Hadera. The city center was regenerated, a high-tech business park was constructed, and the world's largest [[desalination]] plant was built.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/new-urbanism-israeli-style-1.258375 | title=New Urbanism, Israeli Style | accessdate=2008-11-28 |publisher=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabinovitch |first=Ari |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/05/16/us-israel-desalination-idUSTRE64F1O820100516 |title=Israel opens largest desalination plant of its kind |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the city has slowly but steadily attracted new home-buyers. Currently, a development plan is underway to turn Hadera into a major center of home ownership, business, and vacation. Some 18,000 new homes will be built, including 2,500 villas and cottages and 1,300 luxury apartments on the coast. These housing units will be built in new neighborhoods that will be built in the underdeveloped northeastern part of the city, and {{convert|2.5|km|1|abbr=on}} of the coastline will be developed. A large park and several major shopping malls will be built. Ten new hotels with a total of 1,800 rooms will also be built; the city is planned to become a future vacation destination due to its closeness to the [[Galilee]], beaches, and access to major highways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/165239#.UV5a0pOG0j4 No Longer a Backwater, Hadera Plans Big Push - Inside Israel - News - Israel National News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Xaddera124.jpg|thumb|Hadera municipality building]]

Hadera is located on the [[Israeli Coastal Plain|Israeli Mediterranean coastal plain]], {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1082193.html|title=Telfed takes on next target: Hadera|date=1 May 2009|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city's jurisdiction covers {{convert|53,000|dunam|km2 sqmi|1}}, making it the fourth largest city in the country. [[Nahal Hadera Park]], a eucalyptus forest covering {{convert|1,300|dunam|km2 sqmi|1}} and Hasharon Park are located on the outskirts of Hadera.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;

==Transportation==
Hadera lies along two main [[Israel Railways]] lines: the [[Coastal railway line, Israel|Coastal Line]] and the nowadays freight-only [[Eastern Railway (Israel)|Eastern Line]]. The city's [[Hadera West Railway Station|railway station]] is located in the west of the city and is on the Tel Aviv suburban line which runs between [[Binyamina]] and [[Ashkelon]]. The city center of Hadera is located near Israel's two main north-south highways; [[Highway 2 (Israel)|Highway 2]], linking Tel Aviv to Haifa, and [[Highway 4 (Israel)|Highway 4]].&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; This made Hadera an important junction for all coastal bus transportation after 1948 and into the 1950s.

==Economy==
[[File:Orot rabin.JPG|thumb|Orot Rabin chimneys]]
Hadera's importance as an economic center was first recognised when Israel's first paper mill was opened here in 1953. [[Hadera Paper]] continues to be a large employer in the city.

==Historic sites==
Heritage Lincolnshire cares for six historic sites in the county, as well as its headquarters at the Old School in Heckington, Mill Cottage at Little Steeping and its building preservation projects, such as the Old King's Head.

* [[Bolingbroke Castle]] near [[Spilsby]]. The moated ruins of a thirteenth century castle built by [[Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester|Ranulf, Earl of Chester]] that was the birthplace of the future [[Henry IV of England]].

* Holbeach Royal Observer Corps Monitoring Post. An underground post built in 1964 and used by local volunteers from the [[Royal Observer Corps]] to monitor in case of nuclear attack. The post was donated to the Trust by the landowner in 2000 after it had been decommissioned in 1991, following the end of the [[Cold War]].
* Hussey Tower, Boston. The ruined shell of a three story brick tower house that was once part of a larger manorial complex built in the 1460s by Richard Benyngton, who was collector of customs and excise for the wealthy port of Boston. Its name today comes from a later owner, [[John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford|Sir John Hussey]], upon whose execution in 1536 following the [[Pilgrimage of Grace#Lincolnshire Rising|Lincolnshire Rising]] it passed to its present owners [[Borough of Boston|Boston Corporation]], upon whose behalf Heritage Lincolnshire has managed the site since 1997.
* [[Tattershall College]]. The remains of an fifteenth century brick grammar school built by [[Ralph de Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell|Ralph, Lord Cromwell]] for the purpose of providing a free education to the sons of his tenants and the choristers of the college, which was centred on the nearby Collegiate Church of Holy Trinity. Heritage Lincolnshire has managed the site on behalf of [[English Heritage]] since 1995.
* [[Tupholme Abbey]], near [[Bardney]]. The site and standing ruins of a [[Premonstratensian]] [[abbey]] near the [[River Witham]], founded between 1155 and 1165 by [[Gilbert de Neville|Gilbert]] and [[Alan de Neville (landholder)|Alan de Neville]]. The Trust purchased the site in 1988.
* [[Temple Bruer]] on [[Lincoln Heath]]. The surviving twelfth century tower of a round church that once formed part of a preceptory belonging to the [[Knights Templar]]. Heritage Lincolnshire manages the site on behalf of [[Lincolnshire County Council]].

==The Old King's Head, Kirton ==
A project currently being undertaken by Heritage Lincolnshire is the restoration of the [[Old King's Head, Kirton]] near Boston, Lincolnshire a former public house. The earlier part of it was built at the end of the sixteenth century and was given major alterations in 1661 in Artisan Mannerist Style. It is red brick in English Bond with recent tiles over a thatched roof. It became a domestic residence in the 1960s and in 2016 it was purchased by Heritage Lincolnshire for restoration.

'''''Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España''''' (''The True History of the Conquest of New Spain'') is the first-person narrative written in 1576 by [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] (1492&amp;ndash;1581), the military adventurer, ''[[conquistador]]'', and colonist settler who served in three Mexican expeditions; those of [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (discoverer of Yucatán)|Francisco Hernández de Córdoba]] (1517) to the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán peninsula]]; the expedition of [[Juan de Grijalva]] (1518), and the expedition of [[Hernán Cortés]] (1519) in the [[Valley of Mexico]]; the history relates his participation in the fall of Emperor [[Moctezuma II]], and the subsequent defeat of the [[Aztec Empire]].

In the colonial history of Latin America, it is a vivid, military account that establishes Bernal Díaz del Castillo “among chroniclers what [[Daniel Defoe]] is among novelists”.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen citing ''The Conquest of Mexico'', by W.H. Prescott in ''The Conquest of New Spain'' J.M. Cohen, editor. London: Penguin Books, 1963. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in life, when Díaz del Castillo was 84 years old and living in his [[encomienda]] estates in [[Guatemala]], he wrote ''The True History of the Conquest of New Spain'' to defend the story of the common-soldier ''conquistador'' within the histories about the Spanish conquest of Mexico. He presents his narrative as an alternative to the critical writings of  [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], whose Indian-native histories emphasized the cruelty of the conquest as well as the histories of the  [[hagiography|hagiographic]] biographers of [[Hernán Cortés]] (specifically that of [[Francisco López de Gómara]], who Díaz del Castillo believed minimized the role of the 700 enlisted soldiers instrumental to conquering the Aztec Empire). That said, Díaz del Castillo strongly defended the actions of the conquistadors, whilst emphasising their humanity and honesty in his eyewitness narrative, which he summarised as this: "We went there to serve God, and also to get rich."

The history is occasionally uncharitable about Cortés; like other professional soldiers who participated in the Conquest of New Spain, Díaz del Castillo found himself among the ruins of [[Tenochtitlán]] only slightly wealthier than when he arrived to Mexico. That was common to many soldiers, who accused Cortés of taking more loot than his agreed fifth of the Aztec treasury.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Certainly, the land and gold compensation paid to many of the ''conquistadores'' proved a poor return for their investment of months of soldiering and fighting across Mexico and the [[Valley of Mexico|Anahuac Valley]]. Another interpretation{{Or|date=February 2013}} of the book is that the author was one of several family relatives of [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]], the governor of Cuba and a mortal enemy of Cortés; many of whom later plotted against the conquistador Captain. Although the narrative minimizes the Cortés–Díaz del Castillo relationship, the author's complex relationship with Cortés and the lower captains suggests that although he represented the faction of Governor Velázquez de Cuéllar in the expedition, Díaz del Castillo fully honoured Cortés's personal and military loyalty.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

It is thought to be the outline of a person who was sitting at the entrance of Hiroshima Branch of [[Sumitomo Bank]] when [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the atomic bomb was dropped over Hiroshima]]. It is also known as '''Human Shadow of Death'''.&lt;ref name="hpm04abom"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/abom/04abom/kiroku/index.html|title=ヒロシマの記録 貴重な「記憶」次代へ|last=|first=|date=2004-03-22|website=|publisher=[[Chugoku Shimbun]]|language=ja|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outline ==
According to the museum, it is thought that the person had been sitting on the stone step waiting for the bank to open when the heat from the bomb burned the surrounding stone white and left their shadow.&lt;ref name="hm1001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hpm20090309"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/hiroshima-koku/exploration/index_20090309.html|title=熱線で「人が蒸発」本当？|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Hiroshima Peace Media Center|language=ja|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A black deposit was also found on the shadow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/?p=25762|title=ヒロシマの記録2000　3月|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Hiroshima Peace Media Center|language=ja|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A piece of stone containing the artifact (3.3 meters wide by 2 meters high) was cut from the original location and moved to the museum.&lt;ref name="hpm26116"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/?p=26116|title=ヒロシマの記録1971　1月|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Hiroshima Peace Media Center|language=ja|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1971, the museum acquired the stone, whose human shadow had become indistinct due to weathering. In April 1975, the museum began research into preserving the shadow.&lt;ref name="hpm26071"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/?p=26071|title=ヒロシマの記録1975　4月|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Hiroshima Peace Media Center|language=ja|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the museum reported that earnest investigation of preservation methods had commenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/?p=25880|title=ヒロシマの記録1991　5月|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Hiroshima Peace Media Center|language=ja|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the stone is surrounded by glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mainichi.jp/articles/20151212/dde/041/040/043000c|title=針折れる　広島資料館の収蔵資料約２万点、劣化進む|last=|first=|date=2015-12-12|work=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|access-date=2017-09-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news-postseven.com/archives/20160525_414477.html|title=オバマ大統領広島訪問直前に巻き起こった原爆資料館批判|last=|first=|date=2016-05-25|website=|publisher={{ill|News Post Seven|ja|Newsポストセブン}}|language=ja|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that the person depicted in the stone died immediately with the flash of the atomic bomb, or after falling down after the explosion.&lt;ref name="hm1001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/outline/index.php?l=J&amp;id=31|title=人影の石|publisher=[[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]]|accessdate=2017-06-15|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people stated that they saw the person sitting at the entrance just before the bombing.&lt;ref name="hpmbindex" /&gt; A former soldier testified that he had recovered the person's body. However, the person's identity is still unknown.&lt;ref name="hpmbindex"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/abom/97abom/abom/bindex.html|title=「人影の石」説明板に名前追加|publisher=[[Chugoku Shimbun]]|date=1997-08-02|accessdate=2017-06-15|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, the museum exhibit states that "Several people have suggested that the person could be a member of their family". In the past, the museum exhibit contained a statement that the person was a 42-year-old woman named Mitsuno Koshitomo (越智ミツノ).&lt;ref name="hpmbindex" /&gt; As a result of these previous statements, some conclusions in the literature state that she was the person depicted in the stone.

According to museum staff, many visitors to the museum believe that the shadow is the outline of a human vaporized immediately after the bombing.&lt;ref name="hpm20090309" /&gt; However, the possibility of human vaporization is not supported from a medical perspective. The ground surface temperature is thought to have ranged from 3,000 to 4,000 degrees Celsius just after the bombing. Exposing a body to this level of radiant heat would leave bones and [[Carbonization|carbonized]] organs behind. While radiation could severely inflame and [[ulcer|ulcerate]] the skin, complete vaporization of the body is impossible.&lt;ref name="hpm20090309" /&gt;

Human Shadow Etched in Stone was originally part of the stone steps at the entrance of the Hiroshima Branch of Sumitomo Bank, located 260 meters from ground zero.&lt;ref name="hpm04abom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hm1001"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/cgi-bin/museum.cgi?no=1001&amp;l=j|title=人影の石|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]]|language=ja|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current location of the [[Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation]], Hiroshima Branch is Kamiya-cho 1 Chome.{{efn|The branch had been in {{ill|Nakajima-cho (Hiroshima)|ja|中島町 (広島市)|lt=Nakajima-Honmachi}} before it was transferred to a new building in {{ill|Kamiya-cho|ja|紙屋町・八丁堀}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=A-bombed Buildings Investigation Committee |language=ja| title=ヒロシマの被爆建造物は語る | publisher=[[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]] | year=1996 | pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The bank was built in 1928. It was designed by {{nihongo|Kenzo Takekoshi|竹腰健造}} at the department of engineering of [[Sumitomo Group]] (now [[Nikken Sekkei]]), and was constructed by the [[Obayashi Corporation]].&lt;ref name="jstage71_KJ00004366859"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=MING|last2=ISHIMARU|first2=Norioki|title=The Study on the Activities and Their Features of Architects in Hiroshima Before World War Two: The study on the architects activity form and feature in local city|journal=Journal of Architecture and Planning (Transactions of AIJ)|volume=71|issue=608|year=2006|pages=197–204|publisher=[[Architectural Institute of Japan]] |issn=1340-4210|doi=10.3130/aija.71.197_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was constructed out of reinforced concrete, with four floors above ground and one below with an open ceiling up to the third floor. The rooms for business, reception and specie were on the first floor, the meeting rooms and cafeteria on the fourth floor, and the boiler room in the basement.&lt;ref name="jstage71_KJ00004366859" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sensai3"&gt;{{Cite book|language=ja|author= [[Hiroshima City]] |title= 広島原爆戦災誌 |orig-year=1971 |url=http://a-bombdb.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/pdbe/common/download/sensai3.pdf |format=pdf |date=2005 |publisher=[[Hiroshima City]] |volume=3 |pages=149–152|accessdate=2017-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built south of the head office of Geibi Bank (Now head office of {{Interlanguage link|Hiroshima Bank|ja|広島銀行|WD=}},) which had been built the year before and was almost the same size. It had Romanesque architecture style in general, and was characterized by a large arch with [[Molding (decorative)|molding]] on its front.&lt;ref name="jstage71_KJ00004366859" /&gt;

It was not totally destroyed in the bombing of August 6, 1945. While the interior was destroyed, the exterior remained.&lt;ref name="sensai3" /&gt; Fortunately, the specie room was not damaged, and the cash and passbooks remained.&lt;ref name="sensai3" /&gt; Papers inside the building were blown as far away as {{Ill|Numata-cho (Hiroshima)|ja|沼田町 (広島市)|WD=|lt=Numata-cho}} by the blast.{{efn|According to the online map,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://maps.gsi.go.jp/| title=地理院地図 | language=ja | accessdate=2017-11-04 | publisher=[[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is approximately nine kilometers from ground zero to Numata-cho.}}&lt;ref name="sensai3" /&gt;

&lt;!-- According to Sumitomo Bank, 58 employees were working in Hiroshima Branch and Higashi-matsubara Branch at the time. &lt;ref name="sensai3" /&gt; --&gt;On the morning of the bombing, the bank was to be open as usual. Most of the employees were on their way to the office when the bomb was dropped. There were 29 employees killed immediately (including those in the branch and those on their way to work), 40 injured and none missing.&lt;ref name="sensai3" /&gt; Some of the survivors died within a few days from radiation sickness, while others worked until retirement.&lt;ref name="sensai3" /&gt; Passersby took refuge in the building as it was close to ground zero, and a large number of bodies were recovered.&lt;ref name="sensai3" /&gt;

The branch reopened after the war, and the entrance soon became a famous landmark of the damage caused by the atomic bombing. It was officially recognized by Hiroshima City as an A-bomb site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=ja|publisher=[[Chugoku Shimbun]]|url=http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/?gallery=20110706131015977_ja|title=ヒロシマの記録　消えた「原爆十景」追う|date=2007-04-30|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those days, the shadow was called "Human Shadow of Death".&lt;ref name="hpm04abom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jijijlp00570201"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jiji.com/jc/d4?p=atb458-jlp00570201&amp;d=d4_oldnews|title=1945年8月～被爆した広島、長崎～　写真特集|publisher=[[Jiji Press]]|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a testimony, it was the second most famous sight next to the [[Atomic Bomb Dome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=ja|url=http://www.ddk.or.jp/general/ddk_news.php?ddk_news_code=389|title=巻頭言：被爆建物の記憶|year=2013|publisher=DDK Cooperative (協同組合DDK)|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sumitomo Bank went to great lengths to preserve the shadow. In 1959 they built a fence surrounding the stone, and in 1967 they covered the stone with tempered glass to prevent deterioration.&lt;ref name="hpm04abom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hpm26116" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jijijlp00570201" /&gt;

In 1971, the Hiroshima Branch was planned to be rebuilt. The stone around the shadow was cut out and donated to the museum.&lt;ref name="hpm04abom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hpm26116" /&gt;

=== Saying of human vaporization ===
{{Expand section|Literatures containing the saying of human vaporization. |date=October 2017}}
According to {{Ill|Masaharu Hoshi|ja|星正治|WD=}}(1947–), a radiology scientist, in his childhood he heard of the saying that the shadow had been generated after human vaporization.&lt;ref name="hpm20090309" /&gt; "Journal on the damage of atomic bombing in Hiroshima" (広島原爆戦災誌), published by Hiroshima City in 1971, also contains a description implying human vaporization, which is now proved to be impossible.&lt;ref name="hpm20090309" /&gt;{{Quotation|Within a radius of 500 meters of the ground zero, (Omitted) people were killed almost immediately as if they had been vaporized (Omitted) bodies and bones were burned thoroughly almost not to be found, and everything was destroyed, which was buried in white ash.|[[Hiroshima City]]|Journal on the damage of atomic bombing in Hiroshima vol.2&lt;ref name="sensai2"&gt;{{Cite book|language=ja|author= [[Hiroshima City]] |title= 広島原爆戦災誌 |orig-year=1971 |url=http://a-bombdb.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/pdbe/common/download/sensai2.pdf |format=pdf |date=2005 |publisher=[[Hiroshima City]] |volume=2 |page=5|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (translation mine)}}
In the 1994 Committee on Health and Welfare of the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors,]] {{Ill|Eimatsu Takakuwa|ja|高桑栄松}} mentioned the stone, saying "One was vaporized and vanished immediately.

==Early life==
His paternal family seem to have borne the name Simonde, at least from the time when they migrated from [[Dauphiné]] to [[Switzerland]] at the revocation of the [[edict of Nantes]]. It was not till after Sismondi had become an author that, observing the identity of his family arms with those of the once flourishing [[Pisa]]n house of the Sismondi and finding that some members of that house had migrated to France, he assumed the connection without further proof and called himself Sismondi.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Sismondi, Jean Charles Leonard de |volume=25 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Simondes, however, were themselves citizens of Geneva of the upper class, and possessed both rank and property, though the father was also a village pastor.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt; His uncle by marriage was the prominent pastor [[Jacob Vernes]], a friend of [[Voltaire]] and [[Rousseau]].&lt;ref name=Dardier1876&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnUrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA54|page=54|title=Ésaĭe Gasc, citoyen de Genève: sa politique et sa théologie, Genève – Constance – Montauban 1748–1813|author=Charles Dardier|publisher=Sandoz et Fischbacher|year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The future historian was well educated, but his family wished him to devote himself to commerce rather than literature, and he became a banker's clerk in [[Lyon]]. Then the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] broke out, and as it affected Geneva, the Simonde family took refuge in England where they stayed for eighteen months (1793–1794). Disliking—it is said—the climate, they returned to Geneva, but found the state of affairs still unfavourable; there is even a legend that the head of the family was reduced to sell milk himself in the town. The greater part of the family property was sold, and with the proceeds they emigrated to Italy, bought a small farm in [[Pescia]] near [[Lucca]] and [[Pistoia]], and set to work to cultivate it themselves.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt;

Sismondi worked hard there, with both his hands and mind, and his experiences gave him the material of his first book, ''Tableau de l'agriculture toscane'', which, after returning to Geneva, he published there in 1801.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt; At a young age, Sismondi had read ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and became strongly attached to Smith's theories. He apparently published his first work on the subject of political economy, ''De la richesse commerciale ou principes de l'economie politique appliqué à la legislation du commerce'' (1803) to explain and popularize Smith's doctrine, but following this Sismondi spent a considerable amount of time dedicated to historical research. He again turned his attention to political economy around 1818 when he was commissioned to write an entry on "Political Economy" for the ''[[Edinburgh Encyclopædia]]''. This was just following a serious economic downturn after the outbreak of the first major crisis in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.marxists.org/archive/kuruma/crisis-intro.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic thought==
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
[[Image:Sismondi - Nouveaux Principes d’économie politique.djvu|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Title page of ''Nouveaux principes d'économie politique''&lt;/center&gt;]]
As an economist, Sismondi represented a humanitarian protest against the dominant orthodoxy of his time. In his 1803 book, he followed [[Adam Smith]]; but in his principal subsequent economic work, ''Nouveaux principes d'économie politique'' (1819), he insisted on the fact that economic science studied the means of increasing wealth too much, and the use of wealth for producing happiness, too little.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt; For the science of economics, his most important contribution was probably his discovery of [[economic cycle]]s.  In refutation of other thinkers at the time (notably [[Jean-Baptiste Say|J. B. Say]] and [[David Ricardo]]), Sismondi challenged the idea that [[economic equilibrium]] leading to full employment would be immediately and spontaneously achieved.  He wrote, "Let us beware of this dangerous theory of equilibrium which is supposed to be automatically established. A certain kind of equilibrium, it is true, is reestablished in the long run, but it is after a frightful amount of suffering."&lt;ref&gt;Simonde de Sismondi, New Principles of Political Economy, vol. 1 (1819), 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not a socialist; but, in protesting against [[laissez faire]] and invoking the state "to regulate the progress of wealth",&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt; he was an interesting precursor of the German [[Historical school of economics]].&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt;

His theory may more precisely be classed as one of periodic ''crises,'' rather than ''cycles'' per se. and as such is the earliest theorist of systemic [[Crisis theory]]. His theory was adapted by [[Charles Dunoyer]], who introduces the notion of cycling between two phases, thus giving a modern form of economic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://hope.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/41/2/271 Charles Dunoyer and the Emergence of the Idea of an Economic Cycle],'' Rabah Benkemoune, History of Political Economy 2009 41(2):271–295; {{doi|10.1215/00182702-2009-003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sismondi also contributed a great deal to economics with his thoughts on [[aggregate demand]]. Observing the capitalist industrial system in England, Sismondi saw that unchecked competition both resulted in producers all increasing individual production (because of lack of knowledge of other producers' production) this was then seen as forcing employers to cut prices, which they did by sacrificing workers' wages. This yielded [[overproduction]] ''and'' [[underconsumption]]; with most of England's workforce suffering from depressed wages, workers were then unable to afford the goods they had produced, and [[underconsumption]] of goods then followed. Sismondi believed that by increasing the wages of laborers they would have more buying power, be able to buy the national output and thus increase demand.

In his book ''On Classical Economics'', [[Thomas Sowell]] devotes a chapter to Sismondi, arguing that he was a neglected pioneer.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://hope.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/4/1/62 Sismondi: A Neglected Pioneer],'' History of Political Economy 1972 4(1): 62–88; {{doi|10.1215/00182702-4-1-62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italian history==
Meanwhile, he began to compile his great ''Histoire des républiques italiennes du Moyen Âge'', and was introduced to [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël|Madame de Staël]]. He became part of her [[Coppet group]], he was invited or commanded—for Madame de Stael was of chief political importance—to form one of the suite with which the future Corinne made the journey to Italy, which contributed to [[Corinne (novel)|Corinne]] itself during the years 1804–1805. Sismondi was not altogether at ease here, and he particularly disliked [[August Wilhelm von Schlegel|Schlegel]] who was also a participant. But during this journey he met the [[Countess of Albany]], widow of Charles Edward, who all her life was gifted with a singular ability to attract the affection of men of letters. Sismondi's platonic relationship with her was close and lasted long, and they produced much valuable and interesting correspondence.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt;

In 1807 appeared the first volumes of the above-mentioned book about the Italian republics, which, though his essay in political economy had brought him some reputation and the offer of a Russian professorship, first made Sismondi a prominent man among European men of letters. The completion of this book, which extended to sixteen volumes, occupied him, though by no means entirely, for the next eleven years. He lived at first in Geneva where he delivered some interesting lectures about the literature of southern Europe, which were continued from time to time and finally published. He held an official position: secretary of the chamber of commerce for the then department of [[Léman (department)|Leman]].&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt; 

==French history==
Sismondi lived in Paris from 1813 until the Restoration, supporting [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and meeting him once. Upon completing his book on Italian history, in 1818 he began his ''Histoire des Français'', published in 29 volumes over 23 years. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, "His untiring industry enabled him to compile many other books, but it is on these two that his fame mainly rests. The former displays his qualities in the most favourable light, and has been least injuriously affected by subsequent writings and investigations. But the latter, as a careful and accurate sketch on a grand scale, has now been superseded. [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]] has, with benevolent sarcasm, surnamed the author "the [[Charles Rollin|Rollin]] of French History," and the praise and the blame implied in the comparison are both perfectly well deserved".&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt;

==Later life==
In April 1819 Sismondi married&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt; a Welshwoman, Jessie Allen (1777–1853), whose sister, Catherine Allen, was the wife of [[Sir James Mackintosh]] and another sister, Elizabeth Allen, was the wife of [[Josiah Wedgwood II]] and mother of [[Emma Darwin|Emma Wedgwood]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017 |reason=Eb1911 states "Sismondi married an English lady, Miss Allen, whose sister was the wife of Sir James Mackintosh,"}}  This marriage appears to have been a very happy one.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt;  In 1826 he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

After spending the last years of his life in Geneva preparing new editions of his writings, finishing his study of the French, and serving as a member of the Geneva Assembly, speaking for freedom with order, he died in 1842 of stomach cancer.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of World Biography, 2004" /&gt;

==Other works==
[[File:Sismondi - De la richesse commerciale, 1803 - 5763363.tif|thumb|''De la richesse commerciale'', 1803]]
Besides the works mentioned above Sismondi produced many others, never working less than eight hours a day for many years. The most important ones are: ''Littérature du midi de l'Europe'' [Literature of Southern Europe] (1813),&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |date=26 July 1825 |title=Review of New Books |journal=The Literary Chronicle |issue=219 |page=465 |location=London |accessdate=22 June 2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jHQPAAAAQAAJ |quote=[...] Sismondi divides modern literature into two branches, which he makes the subjects of two dissertations: one on the Romance, the other on the Teutonic languages. The former embraces Arabian literature, the Provençals, the Troubadours, Italian and Spanish literature, &amp;c. The second comprises the literature of England, Germany, and other Teutonic nations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a historical novel entitled ''Julia Severa ou l'an 492'' (1822), ''Histoire de la renaissance de la liberté en Italie'' (1832), ''Histoire de la chute de l'Empire romain'' (1835), ''Précis de l'histoire des Français'', an abridgment of his own book (1839), and several others, mainly political pamphlets.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt;

Sismondi's journals and his correspondence with [[William Ellery Channing|Channing]], with the countess of Albany and with others have been published mainly by M&lt;sup&gt;lle&lt;/sup&gt; Mongolfier (Paris, 1843) and M. de [[Saint-René Taillandier]] (Paris, 1863). The latter work serves as the main text of two admirable ''Lundis'' of Sainte-Beuve (September 1863), republished in the ''Nouveaux Lundis'', vol. VI.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt;

==Historiographical position and political stance==
He was a historian whose economic ideas passed through different phases. The acceptance of free trade principles in ''De la richesse commerciale'' was abandoned in favour of a critical posture towards [[free trade]] and industrialisation. ''Nouveaux principes d'économie politique'' attacked wealth accumulation both as an end in itself, and for its detrimental effect on the poor. He indicated contradictions of capitalism. He criticized the harsh conditions endured by the workers from the standpoint of a liberal republican.&lt;ref name="Gareth" /&gt; He was also a passionate opponent of slavery.&lt;ref name="Ekins" /&gt; [[Adolphe Blanqui]] said of him: "No writer has shown a sympathy more notable and more touching for the working classes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lovell |first1=David W. |title=Marx's Proletariat (RLE Marxism): The Making of a Myth |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] referred to Sismondi as "that enlightened author, ingenious, eloquent and selfless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Say |first1=Jean-Baptiste |title=Cours Complet d'Economie Politique Pratique, chap. XVIII |date=1828}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His critique was noticed by [[Malthus]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[John Stuart Mill|J. S. Mill]], who called his writing "sprightly, and frequently eloquent."&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; While a young man at Edinburgh, [[Thomas Carlyle]] translated Sismondi's article on "Political Economy" for [[David Brewster]]'s ''Edinburgh Encyclopædia''.&lt;ref name="Ekins" /&gt; Sismondi subsequently influenced Carlyle's views on "the dismal science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dixon |first1=Robert |title=Carlyle, Malthus and Sismondi: The Origins of Carlyle’s Dismal View of Political Economy |journal=History of Economics Review |date=2006 |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=32-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sismondi's Italian histories were read and esteemed by [[Lord Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and [[Stendhal]].&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Strickland |first1=Geoffrey |title=Stendhal: Education of a Novelist |date=1974 |publisher=CUP Archive |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sismondi influenced many major socialist thinkers including [[Karl Marx]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], and [[Robert Owen]]. Marx thought Sismondi embodied the critique of the "bourgeois science of economics."&lt;ref name="Paresh"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chattopadhyay |first1=Paresh |title=Marx's Associated Mode of Production: A Critique of Marxism |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |pages=39-41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his notes, Marx excerpted various aspects of his analysis. Marx was particularly fond of Sismondi's statement that "The Roman proletariat lived almost exclusively at the expense of society. One could almost say that modern society lives at the expense of the proletariat, from the share which it deducts from the reward of his labor."&lt;ref name="Paresh" /&gt; [[Henryk Grossman]] argued that Sismondi was a 
significant methodological and theoretical predecessor of Marx, particularly by identifying the contradiction between use-value and exchange-value as fundamental to capitalism.&lt;ref name="Kuhn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuhn |first1=Rick |title=Sismondi, Marx and Grossman: Method, Contradictions of the Commodity, and Crisis |journal=Marxism |date=2016 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=262-283}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Lenin]] attempted to discredit Sismondi's work because of the latter's influence on the [[Narodnik]] movement.&lt;ref name="Kuhn" /&gt; Sismondi's writings were widely disseminated throughout Russia during the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barghoorn |first1=Frederick Charles |title=The Russian Radicals of the 1860's and the Problem of the Industrial Proletariat |journal=The Slavonic and East European Review. American Series |date=1943 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=57-69 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3020134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosa Luxemburg defended Sismondi against Lenin's criticisms, as Sismondi's argument that consumption could not keep up with production under capitalism influenced Luxemburg's belief in the inherently imperialist nature of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Kuhn" /&gt;

'''Jim Duffy''' (born 12 April 1966) is an [[Irish people|Irish]] historian, political commentator, and served as a policy advisor to then Irish leader of the Opposition, [[Fine Gael]] leader [[Enda Kenny]] prior to the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 general election]]. He first achieved prominence in 1990 when the contents of his on-the-record interview with then [[Tánaiste]] [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]], in which Lenihan admitted making calls to the residence of the Irish president seeking to speak to [[Patrick Hillery|President Hillery]] to urge him to refuse a Dáil dissolution in controversial circumstances (something he had previously denied), led to Lenihan's dismissal from government, his defeat in that year's Irish [[Irish presidential election, 1990|presidential election]] and the unexpected election of the left wing liberal [[Mary Robinson]] as [[President of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Finlay, ''Mary Robinson: President with a Purpose'' (O'Brien Books, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Duffy was one of six people chosen to submit international reports on heads of state to Australia's [[Republic Advisory Committee]] in 1993. He was an occasional contributor to ''[[The Irish Times]]'' and the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'', and a columnist in ''[[Magill]]'' magazine, as well as appearing on radio and television prior to his appointment to Kenny's office, but has ceased all media work since that date. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Origins==
Duffy was born in [[Drogheda]] in [[County Meath|Meath]]&lt;ref&gt;Drogheda is overwhelmingly in County Louth but a small portion of the town, including the hospital, is located across the county border in neighbouring County Meath.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1966. His family are long-term residents of the [[townland]] of [[Durhamstown]] in the [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of [[Ardbraccan]] and the [[barony (Ireland)|barony]] of Lower Navan, outside [[Navan]] in County Meath. On his maternal side, through his mother Bernadette Duffy (née Cadden) he is descended from Ballydurrow, in [[Munterconnaught]], [[Cavan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.failteromhat.com/griffiths/cavan/munterconnaught.htm Griffith's Valuation entry for Duffy's ancestors in County Cavan.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Duffy was educated in [[Bohermeen]] National School and [[St. Patrick's Classical School]] in Navan, where his classmates included the journalist [[Simon Cumbers]] (who was killed by [[Al Qaeda]] in Saudi Arabia in 2004). In 1984 Duffy began to study History and Politics in [[University College Dublin]], achieving a 2:1 degree in 1987. He received a first class honours degree for his post-graduate thesis on the presidency of Ireland in 1991.

==The Lenihan Interview==
In 1990 as part of his postgraduate thesis for his Master of Arts in Political Science Duffy interviewed senior politicians, one of whom was the then Tánaiste, Brian Lenihan. The on-the-record interview, in May 1990, formed one source for a major series of articles on the presidency of Ireland, published in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' in September 1990. In the interview Lenihan confirmed what he had previously confirmed to other writers over eight years, that on 27 January 1982 he, along with party leader [[Charles Haughey]] and a colleague, [[Sylvester Barrett]], had repeatedly phoned [[Áras an Uachtaráin]], the residence of the President of Ireland, to try to put pressure on the President, [[Patrick Hillery]], to refuse a [[dissolution of parliament]] to the [[Taoiseach]] (prime minister), Dr [[Garret FitzGerald]]. (FitzGerald's government had just been defeated in [[Dáil Éireann]] in a vote on the budget.)

In October 1990, in the midst of the presidential election, FitzGerald was to be a guest, alongside Lenihan, on [[RTÉ One]]'s ''[[Questions and Answers (TV series)|Questions and Answers]]'' political debate programme. He has previously issued a press release about the phone calls issue, but it had received no publicity. He decided to raise the issue of the calls again on the programme, given that in the preceding week Lenihan changed his story of eight years and had now denied twice, first in a student debate, then in an [[Irish Press]] interview with [[Emily O'Reilly]], making any calls. When challenged on the programme Lenihan maintained that his October 1990 version was correct, denying that he had played "any hand, act of part" in attempts to pressurise President Hillery. FitzGerald had been in [[Áras an Uachtaráin]] on the night of the calls and had been told by the President's staff that Lenihan had persistently been making calls. FitzGerald aggressively challenged Lenihan, saying "I was in the Áras, Brian, and I know how many calls there were."&lt;ref&gt;[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] ''Questions and Answers'' 22 October 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aware that Lenihan had been one of Duffy's sources for the original article in September, with Duffy's permission the Irish Times ran a front-page story stating that Lenihan had made the calls he was now denying.&lt;ref&gt;The Irish Times, 24 October 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In the resulting furore Lenihan's campaign manager [[Bertie Ahern]] either deliberately or accidentally revealed on a radio programme that Duffy had interviewed Lenihan.&lt;ref&gt;RTÉ Radio 1 ''News at 1.30''. 25 October 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Duffy became the subject of mounting political and media pressure,&lt;ref&gt;The Irish Times et al., 26 October 1990, quoting press release issued by Duffy.&lt;/ref&gt; with his silence being spun by [[Fianna Fáil]] press staff as evidence that the rumours that Lenihan had confirmed to him that he had made calls were false. (Lenihan had assured his campaign team that he had said nothing in the interview that could cause problems.)&lt;ref&gt;James Downey, ''Lenihan: His Life and Loyalties'' (New Island Books, 1998) p.169.&lt;/ref&gt; After three days of intense political and media pressure, Duffy released the relevant proportion of the on-the-record tape interview he had done with Lenihan. The release took place in a press conference in a [[Dublin]] hotel.&lt;ref&gt;The Irish Times. 26 October 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the tape threw Lenihan's campaign into meltdown. Lenihan tried in a subsequent live television interview on the ''[[Six-One News]]'' to insist that what he had said to Duffy was wrong, insisting that "on mature recollection" his October 1990 version was the correct one, and all that he had said previously over eight years was incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lenihan, ''For the Record'' (Blackwater Press, 1991) pp.148–149.&lt;/ref&gt; However his popularity plummeted by 18% overnight. The opposition [[Fine Gael]] party put down a [[Motion of No Confidence]] in the government. The Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, denied that Lenihan was under any pressure to resign. However, when the minority party in government, the [[Progressive Democrats]], threatened to quit government unless Lenihan resigned or was sacked, and Lenihan refused to resign, the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, instructed President Hillery to sack him. Lenihan went on to become the first candidate from his party ever to lose an Irish presidential election, with the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] candidate, Mary Robinson, eventually winning the office.

Duffy was strongly attacked by the Taoiseach and members of the government under parliamentary privilege, with claims that his research was bogus and that he had been part of a secret plot to destroy Lenihan. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} However, his thesis on the presidency of Ireland was awarded a First Class honour by the [[National University of Ireland]].  He has written an account of the events of this period in the March 2006 edition of [[Magill]] magazine.

==Advising the Republic Advisory Committee==
On the basis of his studies of international heads of state, Duffy was one of six people (including Sir [[Ellis Clarke]], the former Governor-General and President of Trinidad and Tobago) commissioned in 1993 by Australia's [[Republic Advisory Committee]] to prepare reports on international republican experiences —to appear as an appendix to the committee's main report.&lt;ref&gt;The Report of the Republic Advisory Committee. ''An Australian Republic: Vol II: The Options — The Appendices''.&lt;/ref&gt; His report, along with those of five others, was submitted as part of that larger report to the then Australian Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]].

Duffy's recommendations formed a part of the debate in Australia on the possible move from being a monarchy to become a republic. His description of heads of state as fitting three distinct categories (chief executive, Nominal chief executive and Non-Executive) was widely used in the subsequent debate, and were referred to in major speeches by all sides in the debate.&lt;ref&gt;[[ibid]] pp.109–186.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the constitutional referendum on creating a republic in 1999 Duffy in Australian media interviews was critical of the form of presidency being proposed, arguing in particular that the lack of [[security of tenure]] offered to the proposed office holder would seriously compromise the office holder's independence and ability to exercise their powers.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Time (magazine), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1999 referendum on declaring an Australian republic was ultimately defeated.

==Media and research work==
During the 1990s and 2000s, Duffy worked as a researcher and as a political commentator for most major Irish publications, including ''[[The Irish Times]]'', the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'', the ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'', the ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'', ''[[The Sunday Business Post]]'' and the ''[[Irish Examiner]]''. He also was a contributor to RTÉ radio and television, the [[BBC]], [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] and [[Sky News]]. His contributions largely focused on politics, history, religion and current affairs.

He was a columnist with ''[[Magill]]'' magazine, Ireland'a major political and current affairs magazine, until October 2007 when he resigned to take up a research post in politics.

In April and May 2007 he was one of the main contributors to ''Uachtarán'', an eight-part [[TG4]] documentary on the office of [[President of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2007/05/06/story23280.asp Sunday Business Post] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929105616/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2007/05/06/story23280.asp |date=29 September 2007 }} review mentioning Duffy on the programme ''Uachtarán''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political advisor==
In May 2007, the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'' reported that Duffy had been appointed a Deputy Press Officer for Fine Gael for the duration of [[Irish general election, 2007|2007 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/on-mature-recollection-duffy-has-the-inside-story-668042.html Sunday Independent] 6 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007 Duffy was appointed a policy officer in his office by the leader of Fine Gael, Enda Kenny. Duffy resigned his post as columnist with Magill magazine and since that date has ceased to do media work. His new role also involves participating in the National Forum on Europe, a government-created think-tank on the relationship between the European Union and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumoneurope.ie/eng/index.asp?docID=1440 National Forum on Europe website]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 30 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings on religion and gay marriage==
He was a contributor to the Irish Times's ''[[Rite and Reason]]'' religious column on more than one occasion. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} One article in 1998, proposing the existence of ''Rites of Same Sex Union'' (in effect gay marriages) in early Christian prayerbooks up to mediaeval times, caused a controversy. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The article has been republished on gay websites and some religious websites worldwide and has been quoted in debates on [[gay marriage]] in the United States, France, the [[Netherlands]] {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  and has also featured in parliamentary debates in Ireland, {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  including a submission in 2005 from a gay advocacy group {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  to the [[Oireachtas Éireann|Oireachtas]] All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which was exploring whether to amend the [[Constitution of Ireland]] to allow gay marriage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3797">'''John Joseph Lee''' (born 9 July 1942) (commonly known as '''J.J. Lee'''), is an [[Ireland|Irish]] historian and former senator. He is currently Professor of History and Glucksman Professor for Irish Studies and Director of Glucksman Ireland House, at [[New York University]].

Born in [[Tralee]], [[County Kerry]], he spent his early years in [[Castlegregory]] in the same county. He also lived for some years in [[Ballinasloe]], [[County Galway]], where he attended national school. In 1954, he was awarded a [[Galway County Council]] scholarship to attend [[Gormanston College]], [[County Meath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gccapps.galwaycoco.ie/ArchivedDocuments/Galway%20County%20Council,%20Minutes,%20GC-1/GC1-07,%2030-06-1951%20-%2030-06-1956/GC1-07(b)%2030-06-1951%20-%2030-06-1956,%20pp177-356.pdf|title=Minutes of Galway County Council|last=|first=|date=11 September 1954|website=|page=265|access-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated in 1962 from [[University College Dublin]] with first-class honours in History and Economics. He completed his MA some years later on the history of the railways in nineteenth-century Ireland. He was also a graduate student of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electric-review.com/archives/000024.html RIP: Lord Dacre of GlantonPeterhouse contra Trevor-Roper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050516073133/http://www.electric-review.com/archives/000024.html |date=2005-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, he published ''The Modernisation of Irish Society, 1848-1918''. The following year he moved back to Ireland to become Professor of Modern History at [[University College Cork]], succeeding [[Oliver McDonagh]]. He held the chair until 2002.

His 1989 ''[[Ireland, 1912-1985: Politics and Society]]'' won the ''[[Irish Independent]]/[[Irish Life]]'' Prize for History in 1991; and both the [[Aer Lingus]]/[[Irish Times]] Prize for Literature  and the J.S. Donnelly, Snr. Prize for History and Social Sciences in 1992.

He has been a member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] since 1985.

In 1993, he was elected to the [[Members of the 20th Seanad|20th Seanad Éireann]] as an [[Independent politician|independent]] member for the [[National University of Ireland (constituency)|National University of Ireland]] constituency.

'''Lothar Berthold''' (30 August 1926 - 12 September 2007) was an [[East Germany|East German]] [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historian]], university teacher and publisher.   He was also an official of the country's ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (''"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands"'' / SED)]].   During the 1960s he was a member of the [[Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands#Politburo of the Central Committee|politburo's]] "Ideology Commission", widely regarded as one of the most committed and effective propagandists among [[East Germany]]'s mainstream academic historians.    His publications and political engagement after [[German reunification|reunificaion]] reflected a continuing commitment to East German-style communism.&lt;ref name=LMlautwww&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3b-1424.html?ID=244|title=Berthold, Lothar   * 30.8.1926, † 12.9.2007   Historiker, Verlagsdirektor|author=Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk| publisher=Ch.

== Life ==
Berthold was born in [[Zabrze|Hindenburg (as Zabrze had been renamed]] [[Battle of Tannenberg|after 1914]]).   Hindenburg was a substantial manufacturing city in [[Upper Silesia]]:  the [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|1921 plebiscite]] had identified it as a predominantly German-speaking city, albeit by a narrow margin.   Lothar Berthold's father worked as a [[Customs officer|customs official]].   After completing his [[Abitur|school final exams (Abitur)]] at a relatively young age, in 1943/44 he became a [[Luftwaffenhelfer|Luftwaffenhelfer (''loosely: "air defence assistant"'')]].   In 1944 he was enrolled into the [[Reich Labour Service|National Labour Scheme]].   Before the end of the year he had been conscripted into the [[Wehrmacht|army]].   He was briefly a member of the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name=KPD1930lautLB/&gt;   By the time the war ended, in May 1945, he had already been promoted to a junior officer rank.&lt;ref name=LMlautwww/&gt;

The [[End of World War II in Europe|ending of the war]] brought [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|industrial scale ethnic cleansing]] to [[Silesia]] followed by [[Treaty of Zgorzelec|frontier changes]].  Berthold found himself relocated to the central portion of Germany, [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|administered now]] as the [[Soviet occupation zone]].   Communist Party membership was no longer outlawed, and early in 1946 he became a youthful member of the re-emerging [[Communist Party of Germany]].   He was actively involved in the [[Merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany|contentious party merger]] which led, in April 1946, to the launch of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (''"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands"'' / SED)]], quickly signing his party membership over to the newly united - albeit effective as such only in the Soviet zone - "party of the left".&lt;ref name=LBNachruflautRF/&gt;   Comrades attest that it was as a result of the education reforms in the emerging communist German state that he was able, almost immediately, to enroll at the [[University of Jena|Friedrich Schiller University]] at [[Jena]] where he studied [[History]], [[German studies]] and [[Philosophy]] between 1946 and 1950, emerging with a degree&lt;ref name=KPD1930lautLB/&gt; and a Level I teaching qualification.&lt;ref name=LMlautwww/&gt;&lt;ref name=LBNachruflautRF/&gt;

In October 1949 the [[Soviet occupation zone]] had been relaunched as the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet sponsored]] [[German Democratic Republic|German Democratic Republic (East Germany)]], seen by critics as a new kind of German [[One-party state|one-]][[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] [[Constitution of East Germany|dictatorship]], with the SED as its ruling party.   Berthold worked between 1950 and 1952 as a research assistant at the party's [[Parteihochschule Karl Marx|Karl Marx Academy]], located at that time [[:de:Neue Hakeburg|just outside]] [[East Berlin|Berlin]].   The focus of his work was on the history of the German labour movement and, more specifically, on the development of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] in [[Weimar Germany|Germany]].   In 1952 he added a [[Docent|teaching position]] at the academy to his research work.&lt;ref name=LBNachruflautRF/&gt;   He received his doctorate in 1955 for a piece of work (subsequently published as a book&lt;ref name=KPD1930lautLB&gt;{{cite book|title=Das Programm der KPD zur nationalen und sozialen Befreiung des deutschen Volkes vom August 1930|author= Lothar Berthold|publisher=Karl Dietz Verlag, Berlin|date=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;) on Communist Party history.&lt;ref name="BaumgartnerHebig1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gabriele Baumgartner|author2=Dieter Hebig|title=Berthold, Lothar |work=Biographisches Handbuch der SBZ/DDR.

The same year he was appointed to a professorship at the [[Parteihochschule Karl Marx|academy]].&lt;ref name=KPD1930lautLB/&gt;

In 1962 he was appointed to as position at the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany#Central Committee|Party Central Committee's]] Institute for [[Marxism–Leninism]], initially as head of the Department for the History of the Labour Movement.   He also served, between 1962 and 1964, as a deputy president of the institute.&lt;ref name=LMlautwww/&gt;   He was promoted in 1964, becoming the institute's president in succession to [[Roland Bauer]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=147|author1=[[Bernd-Rainer Barth]]|author2=|title=Bauer, Roland * 19.3.1928 SED-Funktionär, Vizepräsident der Historikergesellschaft |publisher= Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur: Biographische Datenbanken|accessdate= 26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Along with this position, which Berthold held for the next four years, he was appointed a member of the [[Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands#Politburo of the Central Committee|politburo's]] influential "Ideology Commission".&lt;ref name=LBNachruflautRF/&gt;&lt;ref name=LBlautArchiv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argus.bstu.bundesarchiv.de/tony21/index.htm?kid=eff82288-7210-4ce2-86e1-feca541ae7f2| title=Einleitung [um Lothar Berthold] Biografische Angaben|publisher=Präsidenten des Bundesarchivs, Dr. Michael Hollmann, [[Koblenz]]|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Along with his responsibilities at the institute, between 1962 and 1968 Berthold was editor in chief of "Beiträge zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung", an academic journal focusing on the history of the labour movement, a topic of considerable importance for the [[Walter Ulbricht|national leadership]].

In 1967 the eldest of the Bertholds' three daughters, Erika-Dorothea, became friendly with [[Florian Havemann]], whose father, [[Robert Havemann]] was one of the country's most high-profile (and intellectually brilliant) political dissidents.   The crushing of the [[Prague Spring]] movement in August 1968 through an invasion by fraternal tanks from around the [[Warsaw Pact]] caused unease at many levels in East Germany, but most people kept their doubts to themselves.   Nevertheless, a number of young people, including some of the adolescent children of East German intellectuals, such as [[Thomas Brasch]], [[Florian Havemann]] and his girl-friend, Erika-Dorothea Berthold, expressed their opposition to the Warsaw Pact intervention through a series of street protests in Berlin.&lt;ref name=ProtestelautRHGes&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.jugendopposition.de/themen/145443/proteste-in-berlin?video=145081|title=Proteste in Berlin| publisher=Robert-Havemann-Gesellschaft e.V., Berlin|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also painted the name "[[Alexander Dubček|Dubcek]]" on walls and distributed leaflets spelling out their concerns.&lt;ref name=KlugeKinderlautAS&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.zeit.de/1997/24/Kluge_Kinder_sterben_frueh/komplettansicht|title="Kluge Kinder sterben früh"|work=Die Achtundsechziger der DDR: Was verbindet, was trennt sie von jenen der Bundesrepublik?| author=Annette Simon|date=6 June 1997| publisher=[[Die Zeit]] (online)| accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After slightly less than three months in investigatory custody, the young people faced trial between 21 and 28 October 1968 and were condemned to prison terms or, in the case of Florian Havemann who was only 16, "educational measures".&lt;ref name=1968lautMM/&gt;   In November 1968 those sentenced to prison terms were released on probabtion because, it was reported, they had displayed "remorseful insight" ("reuevolle Einsicht").&lt;ref name=1968lautMM&gt;{{cite web|title="Denkt bitte nach und schweigt nicht!"|work=Heute vor genau 24 Jahren: Staatsfeindliche Aktionen von DDRlern gegen den Einmarsch der Sowjets am 21.August 1968 in die Tschechoslowakei|author=Margit Miosga|date=21 August 1992|url= http://www.taz.de/!1656414/|publisher=taz Verlags u. Vertriebs GmbH |accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Erika-Dorothea Berthold was nonetheless prevented from completing her schooling.  She was already living with her boy-friend in a [[Kommune 1|commune]] and was now, despite her stellar academic pedigree, required to train for work as a librarian.&lt;ref name=KlugeKinderlautAS/&gt;   Lothar and Erika Berthold (Erika-Dorothea's mother) were appalled.   The shock was all the greater because of the prominent part in the protest played by the eldest daughter of a committed academic member of the "Ideology Commission".   By the end of 1968 Lothar Berthold, as the young protester's father, had been obliged to resign not merely from the commission but also from the presidency of the Institute for [[Marxism–Leninism]] and "associated functions".&lt;ref name=KPD1930lautLB/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZensurlautSL&gt;{{cite web| pages=315–350|url=https://zeitgeschichte-digital.de/doks/files/1033/lokatis_rote_faden_2003_de.pdf| title=Der rote Faden.

Lothar Berthold won the [[Patriotic Order of Merit]] in bronze&lt;ref name=VVObronze&gt;''[[Berliner Zeitung]]'', 6. October 1963, p 4&lt;/ref&gt; in 1963 and then, after just two years, in silver.&lt;ref name=VVOsilver/&gt;   A normal progression during the next ten or so years would have been to the gold version of the same award.   That never happened, but he did win other - possibly less prestigious - awards from the government over the next couple of decades, and it soon became apparent that removal from the Institute for [[Marxism–Leninism]] would not mark the end of his academic career.   Between 1969 and 1972 he was employed as an academic research assistant at the Central Institute for History of the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|(East) German Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] in central Berlin.&lt;ref name=LMlautwww/&gt;   Between 1972 and 1976 he served as the institute's deputy director.&lt;ref name=LBNachruflautRF/&gt;  In 1976 he took over from Werner Mussler as a director of the [[Akademie Verlag]], which was the publishing house affiliated with the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|academy]].   He held core operational responsibilities as the publisher's director for printing and publishing.&lt;ref name=LMlautwww/&gt;   He also served, between 1979 and 1990, as director of the [[Weimar]] based business [[:de:Böhlau Verlag|"Hermann Böhlaus Nachfolger"]] publishing operation which had, in effect, functioned as a subsidiary of the [[Akademie Verlag]] since becoming cut off from its [[Vienna]] holding company by the so-called "[[iron curtain]]".&lt;ref name=LMlautwww/&gt;

In 1990, the year when social and political [[Die Wende|changes]] led first to the [[East German general election, 1990|end of East Germany's forty year Soviet-style dictatorship]] and then to [[German reunification|reunification]], Lothar Berthold retired on health grounds, stepping down from all his functions.   He does indeed appear to have been in poor and declining health during the years that followed.&lt;ref name=LBNachruflautRF/&gt;   He nevertheless worked actively with the "Marxist working group on the history of the German labour movement" (''"Marxistische Arbeitskreis zur Geschichte der deutschen Arbeiterbewegung"'') which functioned under the auspices of [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS)]], which was emerging as a new formulation, for a democratic Germany, of East Germany's old [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (SED)]], which itself was by now widely (though by no means universally) discredited and disparaged.&lt;ref name=LMlautwww/&gt;   In the context of the working group he co-organised various conferences.   He also continued to contribute written works to various left-wing ad communist journals.&lt;ref name=LMlautwww/&gt;

== Works ==
Between 1963 and 1966 Lothar Berthold served as secretary to the authors' collective, mandated to compile and produce an eight-volume history of the German labour movement.   The importance of the project is apparent from the identity of the man leading the project, [[Walter Ulbricht]], better known then as now, for his position as the First [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Party]] Secretary - the national leader - than as a scholar of history.&lt;ref name=ZensurlautSL/&gt;   It was, therefore, not just as an administrator but also as a compiler-editor and author that Berthold operated at the heart of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party's]] propaganda structure.&lt;ref name=LBNachruflautRF/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZensurlautSL/&gt;

Also worth highlighting in Berthold's two-volume biography of [[Ernst Thälmann]], the hardline Stalinist leader of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] between 1925 and 1933 who was later killed by [[Nazi Germany|the Nazis]] after eleven years detained in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=ETlautwwwHDK&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=5281|title=Thälmann, Ernst * 16.4.1886, † 18.8.1944|author1=[[Hermann Weber]]| author2=[[Andreas Herbst]]| publisher=Karl Dietz Verlag, Berlin &amp; Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin|work="Handbuch der Deutschen Kommunisten:"|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Comrades attributed great political value to the biography, seen as a reason why Berthold won the [[National Prize of the German Democratic Republic]] not once but twice.   He was also active for many years as a "Friend of the Ernst Thälmann Memorial Centre" (''im "Freundeskreis  der Ernst-Thälmann-Gedenkstätte"'') and a regular speaker at events held in the [[:de:Sporthaus Ziegenhals|Sporthaus Ziegenhals (memorial-hostelry)]] where Thälmann held the last meeting of the Communist Party before the Nazis [[Enabling Act of 1933|closed down political pluralism]] back in 1933.&lt;ref name=LBNachruflautRF/&gt;

'''Martiros Kavoukjian''' ({{lang|hy|Մարտիրոս Գավուգչյան}}, ''{{lang|hy-Latn|Gavowgčyan}}'', August 8, 1908 - August 8, 1988) was an  [[Armenians|Armenian]] architect, researcher, Armenologist and historian-archaeologist who has written various books on ancient [[History of Armenia|Armenian history]].&lt;ref name="Martiros Kavoukjian: Biography on Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martiros Kavoukjian: Biography on Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia (PDF on MediaFire)"/&gt; He is best known for his account of [[Prehistoric Armenia|Armenian prehistory]] in  ''Armenia, Subartu And Sumer'', published in 1987 in both [[English language|English]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]].

==Biography==
Martiros Kavoukjian was born in [[Nigde]], [[Turkey]] on August 8, 1908. His family soon moved to [[Mosul]], [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="Martiros Kavoukjian: Biography on Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martiros Kavoukjian: Biography on Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia (PDF on MediaFire)"/&gt; Kavoukjian graduated from the American University of [[Beirut]] in 1934 majoring in Architectural engineering, then worked as the chief municipal architect of Mosul, Iraq during the period from 1941 to 1947.&lt;ref name="Martiros Kavoukjian: Biography on Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martiros Kavoukjian: Biography on Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia (PDF on MediaFire)"/&gt; In Iraq, he designed and built both governmental and residential buildings.&lt;ref name="Martiros Kavoukjian: Biography on Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martiros Kavoukjian: Biography on Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia (PDF on MediaFire)"/&gt; Kavoukjian immigrated to Armenia in 1947, and in 1947-1979, he played a key role within the "Great Rebuilding Project" of Armenia as the chief architect, building numerous federal, public, industrial, and residential buildings.&lt;ref name="Martiros Kavoukjian: Biography on Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martiros Kavoukjian: Biography on Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia (PDF on MediaFire)"/&gt; In 1973, his "The Origin of the Names Armen and Hye and Urartu" was published in Beirut.&lt;ref name="Martiros Kavoukjian: Biography on Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martiros Kavoukjian: Biography on Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia (PDF on MediaFire)"/&gt;

Studies of Kavoukjian have been cited in the works by [[Edgar C. Polomé]], Alexander Jacob,&lt;ref&gt;Ātman: a reconstruction of the solar cosmology of the Indo-Europeans, by Alexander Jacob - 2005 - 253 p.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George A. Bournoutian]], [[Richard G.

Armenologist, [[archimandrite]] Gomidas Hovnanian in a 2006 interview described Kavoukjian as "a talented scientist" who had written a research on "The ancestral home of the Celtic tribes and Celtic-Caucasian connections".&lt;ref&gt;Hovnanian is convinced that "the 'unknown country of the Celts' is Armenia (named "[[Aratta]]" by the Sumerians)". This question has been considered in detail by talented scientist  Martiros Kavoukjian in his "the ancestral home of the Celtic tribes and Celtic-Caucasian connections", and more recently Ruben Yegiazaryan has added his contribution to the topic with the book "Celtic symbolism and Armenian legend" (Yerevan, 2005, in Russian).
&lt;!--
В них отмечается, что этой неизвестной страной кельтов является Армения, называемая "Страной священных законов" (так шумеры называли Аратту). Этот вопрос талантливый ученый Мартирос Гавукчян подробно рассмотрел в своем исследовании "Прародина кельтских племен и кельтско-кавказские связи", а сегодня Рубен Егиазарян внес новый вклад в эту тему в своей книге "Кельтская символика и армянское предание" (Ереван, 2005, на русском языке).

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 an evening commemorating Kavoukjian's legacy took place in [[Montreal]], Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyecal.com/events/index.php?com=detail&amp;eID=230&amp;year=2009&amp;month=3&amp;lID=3 Armenian Calendar]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Armenia, Subartu And Sumer''''' 
is inspired by the [[Armenian hypothesis]] of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European origins]]. It seeks to establish an ethnic [[Armenians|Armenian]] identity for the "[[Armani (kingdom)|Armani]]" mentioned by [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], for "Armani-[[Subartu|Subari]] connections" and "Armani-Subari-[[Sumer]] relations". The English translation was published privately with the support of the Malkhassian Foundation, Montreal. The book is identified as a "chauvinist attempt to equate the Proto-Armenians with various mentioned peoples in cuneiform and classical sources" by P. Kohl and G. Tzetzkhladze  (1996).&lt;ref&gt;"Nationalism, politics, and the practice of archaeology in the Caucasus", in: Kohl, Fawcett (eds.), ''Nationalism, Politics and the Practice of Archaeology'', Cambridge University Press (1996), {{ISBN|0521558395}}, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4393">'''Melchior Goldast ab Haiminsfeld''' ('''Goldastus''')(6 January 1576 or 1578 - [[Gießen]], 1635) was a Swiss jurist, and an industrious though uncritical collector of documents relating to the [[Holy Roman Empire|medieval history and constitution of Germany]]. He was a [[Calvinist]] writer of note.

==Life==
He was born of poor Protestant parents near [[Bischofszell]], in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Thurgau]]. His university career, first at [[Ingolstadt]] (1595‑1596), then at Altdorf near [[Nuremberg]] (1597‑1598), was cut short by his poverty, from which he suffered all his life, and which was the main cause of his wanderings. In 1598 he found a rich protector in the person of Bartholomaeus Schobinger, of [[St. Gallen|St Gall]], by whose liberality he was enabled to study at St Gall (where he first became interested in medieval documents, which abound in the [[Abbey of St. Gall]]) and elsewhere in Switzerland. The year before his patron's death in 1604, he became secretary to [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, vicomte de Turenne, duc de Bouillon|Henri, duc de Bouillon]], with whom he went to [[Heidelberg]] and [[Frankfurt]]. But in 1604 he entered the service of the Baron von Hohensax, the possessor of the [[Codex Manesse]], the precious manuscript volume of old German ''[[Minnesang|Minnesänger]]'' of which Goldast published excerpts.  Soon he was back in Switzerland, and by 1606 in Frankfurt, earning his living by preparing and correcting books for the press. In 1611 he was appointed councillor at the court of [[Saxe-Weimar]], and in 1615 he entered the service of Graf [[Ernst of Schaumburg|Ernst von Schaumburg]] at [[Buckeburg]]. In 1624 he was forced by developments in the [[Thirty Years War]] to retire to [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]]; there in 1625 he deposited his library in that of the town,&lt;ref&gt;His books were bought by the town in 1646, but many of his manuscripts passed to Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], and hence are now in the [[Vatican Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; he himself returning to Frankfurt. In 1627 he became councillor to the [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand II]] and to the [[Elector of Trier|archbishop-elector of Trier]], and in 1633 passed to the service of the [[landgrave]] of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]]. He died at Gießen early in 1635.

==Bibliography==
His immense industry is shown by the fact that his biographer, Heinrich Christian Senckenberg, gives a list of 65&amp;nbsp;works published or written by him, some extending to several substantial volumes. Among the more important are his ''Paraeneticorum veterum pars&amp;nbsp;i.'' (1604), which contained the old German tales of Kunig [[Tyrol von Schotten]], the [[Winsbeke]] and the [[Winsbekin]]; [[Suevi|''Suevicarum rerum scriptores'']] (Frankfurt, 1605, new edition, 1727); [[Alamanni|''Rerum Alamannicarum scriptores'']] (Frankfurt, 1606, new edition by Senckenburg, 1730); ''Constitutiones imperiales'' (Frankfurt, 1607‑1613, 4&amp;nbsp;vols.); ''Monarchia sacri Romani imperii'' (Hanover and Frankfurt, 1612‑1614, 3&amp;nbsp;vols.); ''Commentarii de regni Bohemiae juribus'' (Frankfurt, 1627, new edition by Schmink, 1719). He also edited [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]]'s ''Historia sui temporis'' (1609‑1610) and the works of [[Willibald Pirckheimer]] (1610).

In 1688 a volume of letters addressed to him by his learned friends was published.

The '''Migration Period''', also known as Barbarian invasions in Mediterranean countries, was a period that began [[Late antiquity|as early as 300 AD]] in which there were widespread [[Human migration|migrations]] of [[Tribe|peoples]] within or into [[Europe]] during the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], mostly into Roman territory, notably the [[Germanic tribes]] and the [[Huns]]. It has also been termed in [[English language|English]] by the [[German language|German]] loanword '''''{{lang|de|Völkerwanderung}}'''''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Literally "wandering of peoples", sometimes anglicised as "folkwandering" in older sources. The term ''{{lang|de|Völkerwanderungszeit}}'' is the German for "Migration Period". See [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/v%C3%B6lkerwanderung ''Völkerwanderung'' according to Collins].&lt;/ref&gt; and—from the '''Mediterranean''' perspective—the '''Barbarian Invasions'''.&lt;ref&gt;Halsall, Guy. Barbarian migrations and the Roman West, 376–568. Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the migrations were movements of [[Germanic people|Germanic]], [[Huns|Hunnic]], [[Slavic people|Slavic]] and other peoples into the territory of the then declining Roman Empire, with or without accompanying invasions or war.

Historians give differing dates, but the Migration Period is typically regarded as beginning with the invasion of Europe by the Huns from Asia in 375 and ending either with the conquest of Italy by the [[Lombards]] in 568,&lt;ref&gt;As shown in the title of Halsall, (2008), ''Barbarian Migrations and the Roman West, 376–568''&lt;/ref&gt; or at some point between 700 and 800.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FYO7UBBhWKIC&amp;pg=PA5 "The Migration period (fourth to eighth century)"], p.5 ''Migration Art, A.D. 300-800'', 1995, Metropolitan Museum of Art, ed. Katharine Reynolds Brown, {{ISBN|0870997505}}, 9780870997501 &lt;/ref&gt;  Various factors contributed to this phenomenon, and the role and significance of each one is still very much discussed among experts on the subject. Starting in 382, the Roman Empire and individual tribes [[Foederati|made treaties]] regarding their settlement in its territory. The [[Franks]], a Germanic tribe that would later found [[Francia]]—a predecessor of modern [[France]] and [[Germany]]—settled in the Roman Empire and were given a task of securing the northeastern [[Gaul]] border. Western Roman rule was first violated with the [[Crossing of the Rhine]] and the following invasions of the [[Vandals]] and [[Suebi]]. With wars ensuing between various tribes, as well as local populations in the Western Roman Empire, more and more power was transferred to Germanic and Roman militaries.

There are contradicting opinions whether the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] was a result or cause of these migrations, or both. The [[Eastern Roman Empire]] was less affected by migrations and survived until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1453. In the modern period, the Migration Period was increasingly described with a rather negative connotation, and seen as contributing to the fall of the empire. In place of the fallen Western Rome, [[Barbarian kingdoms]] arose in the 5th and 6th centuries and decisively shaped the European [[Early Middle Ages]].

The migrants comprised war bands or tribes of 10,000 to 20,000 people,&lt;ref name="Heather2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Heather|title=The Visigoths from the Migration Period to the Seventh Century: An Ethnographic Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MADmH2eaGIC&amp;pg=PA54|year=2003|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-1-84383-033-7|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the course of 100 years they numbered not more than 750,000 in total, compared to an average 39.9&amp;nbsp;million population of the Roman Empire at that time. Although immigration was common throughout the time of the Roman Empire,&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Milani-Santarpia, [http://www.mariamilani.com/ancient_rome/immigration_roman_empire.htm "Immigration Roman Empire"], MariaMilani.com&lt;/ref&gt; the period in question was, in the 19th century, often defined as running from about the 5th to 8th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;John Hines, Karen Høilund Nielsen, Frank Siegmund, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=T-NjTrfyOY2d-wbQxazyCQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=mq1mAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=migration+period+chronology&amp;q=%27400-800%27#search_anchor The pace of change: studies in early-medieval chronology], Oxbow Books, 1999, p. 93, {{ISBN|978-1-900188-78-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The delimiting dates vary, but often cited are 410, the [[Sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome]] by [[Alaric I]]; and 751, the accession of [[Pepin the Short|Pippin the Short]] and the establishment of the [[Carolingian dynasty]].&lt;/ref&gt; The first migrations of peoples were made by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] such as the [[Goths]] (including the [[Visigoths]] and the [[Ostrogoths]]), the [[Vandals]], the [[Anglo-Saxons]], the [[Lombards]], the [[Suebi]], the [[Frisii]], the [[Jutes]], the [[Burgundians]], the [[Alemanni]], the [[Scirii]] and the [[Franks]]; they were later pushed westward by the [[Huns]], the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], the [[Slavs]] and the [[Bulgars]].&lt;ref&gt;Bury, J. B., The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians, Norton Library, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later invasions—such as the [[Vikings|Viking]], the [[Normans|Norman]], the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], the [[Moors|Moorish]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol]]—also had significant effects (especially in [[North Africa]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]], [[Anatolia]] and [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]); however, they are usually considered outside the scope of the Migration Period.

The first wave moved westward and southward (pushing the resident [[Celts]] west to the [[Rhine]] by about 200&amp;nbsp;BC), moving into [[southern Germany]] up to the Roman provinces of [[Gaul]] and [[Cisalpine Gaul]] by 100&amp;nbsp;BC, where they were stopped by [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Julius Caesar]]. It is this western group which was described by the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (56–117 AD) and Julius Caesar (100–44 BC). A later wave of Germanic tribes migrated eastward and southward from [[Scandinavia]] between 600 and 300&amp;nbsp;BC to the opposite coast of the [[Baltic Sea]], moving up the [[Vistula]] near the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. During [[Tacitus]]' era they included lesser known tribes such as the [[Tencteri]], [[Cherusci]], [[Hermunduri]] and [[Chatti]]; however, a period of federation and intermarriage resulted in the familiar groups known as the [[Alemanni]], [[Franks]], [[Saxons]], [[Frisians]] and [[Thuringii|Thuringians]].&lt;ref&gt;Bury, Invasion, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|The first phase}}First phase ===
{{further|Roman Iron Age (Northern Europe)}}
The Barbarian Invasions may be divided into two phases.
The first phase, occurring between AD&amp;nbsp;300 and 500, is partly documented by Greek and Latin historians but difficult to verify [[Archaeology|archaeologically]]. It puts Germanic peoples in control of most areas of what was then the [[Western Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name = halsall51&gt;{{harvtxt |Halsall|2006|p = 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tervingi]] entered Roman territory (after a clash with the [[Huns]]) in 376. Some time thereafter in [[Marcianopolis]], the escort to [[Fritigern]] (their leader) was killed while meeting with [[Lupicinus (Roman)|Lupicinus]].{{Sfn |Wolfram|2001|pp=127ff.}} The Tervingi rebelled, and the [[Visigoths]], a group derived either from the Tervingi or from a fusion of mainly Gothic groups, eventually invaded Italy and [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome]] in 410, before settling in Gaul, and then, 50 years later, in Iberia, founding [[Visigothic Kingdom|a kingdom]] that lasted for 250 years. They were followed into Roman territory first by a confederation of [[Heruli]]an, [[Rugians|Rugian]], and [[Scirii|Scirian]] warriors, under [[Odoacer]], that deposed [[Romulus Augustulus]] on 4 September 476, and later by the [[Ostrogoths]], led by [[Theodoric the Great]], who settled in Italy. In [[Gaul]], the Franks (a fusion of western Germanic tribes whose leaders had been aligned with Rome since the third century AD) entered Roman lands gradually during the fifth century, and after consolidating power under [[Childeric I|Childeric]] and his son [[Clovis I|Clovis’s]] decisive victory over [[Syagrius]] in 486, established themselves as rulers of northern Roman Gaul. Fending off challenges from the Allemanni, Burgundians, and Visigoths, the Frankish kingdom became the nucleus of what would later become France and Germany. The initial [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] occurred during the fifth century, when [[Roman Britain|Roman control of Britain]] had come to an end.{{Sfn | Dumville | 1990}} The [[Burgundians]] settled in North Western Italy, Switzerland and Eastern France in the fifth century.

=== {{anchor|The second phase}}Second phase ===
{{further|Early Slavs}}
[[File:The origin and dispersion of Slavs in the 5-10th centuries.png|thumb|300px|Migration of early [[Slavs]] in Europe the between 5th-10th centuries AD]]

The second phase took place between 500 and 700 and saw [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes settling more areas of central Europe and pushing further out into southern and eastern Europe, gradually making the eastern half of the continent predominantly Slavic.&lt;ref name=kob530&gt;Zbigniew Kobyliński. The Slavs ''in''  Paul Fouracre. The New Cambridge Medieval History pp.&amp;nbsp;530–537&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Turkic tribes such as the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] became involved in this phase. In 567, the Avars and the Lombards destroyed much of the [[Gepids|Gepid Kingdom]]. The [[Lombards]], a Germanic people, settled in [[Italy]] with their [[Heruli]]an, [[Suebi]]an, [[Gepid]], [[Thuringii|Thuringian]], [[Bulgar]]ian, [[Sarmatian]] and [[Saxon]] allies in the 6th century.&lt;ref name="DBI"&gt;Bertolini 1960, pp. 34–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schutz 2002, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; They were later followed by the [[Bavarian dynasty|Bavarians]] and the Franks, who conquered and ruled most of Italy. The [[Bulgars]], originally a nomadic group from [[Central Asia]], had occupied the [[Pontic steppe]] north of [[Caucasus]] since the second century, but after, pushed by the [[Khazars]], the majority of them migrated west and dominated [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territories along the [[First Bulgarian Empire|lower Danube]] in the seventh century. From this time and onward the demographic picture of the [[Balkans]] changed permanently becoming predominantly Slavic, while pockets of native people survived in the mountains of southwest Balkans, [[Albanians|Albania]] and [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Fine, John Van Antwerp (1983), The Early Medieval Balkans, University of Michigan Press, {{ISBN|0-472-08149-7}}, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Miracles of Saint Demetrius&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early [[Byzantine–Arab Wars]], [[Rashidun army|Arab armies]] attempted to invade [[Balkans|southeast Europe]] via [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] during the late seventh and early eighth centuries, but were defeated at the [[siege of Constantinople (717–718)]] by the joint forces of Byzantium and the [[Bulgars]]. During the [[Khazar–Arab Wars]], the [[Khazars]] stopped the [[Muslim conquests|Arab expansion]] into [[Europe]] across the [[Caucasus]] (7th and 8th centuries). At the same time, the Moors (consisting of [[Arab]]s and [[Berber people|Berbers]]) invaded Europe via [[Gibraltar]] ([[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquering Hispania]]—the [[Iberian Peninsula]]—from the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in 711), before being halted. These battles broadly demarcated the frontiers between [[Christendom]] and [[Muslim world|Islam]] for the next [[millennium]]. The following centuries saw the Muslims successful in [[History of Islam in southern Italy|conquering most of Sicily]] from the Christians by 902.

The [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] from around 895 and the following [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]], and the [[Viking expansion]] from the late 8th century conventionally mark the last large movements of the period. Christianity [[Christianization#Christianization of Europe (7th–15th centuries)|gradually converted]] the non-Islamic newcomers and integrated them into the medieval Christian order. After that, the [[German eastward expansion]] (german: ''(Deutsche) Ostsiedlung'') started in the 11th century in Eastern Europe.

== {{anchor|Modern discourse}}Discussions ==
=== Barbarian identity ===
Analysis of barbarian identity and how it was created and expressed during the Barbarian Invasions has elicited discussion among scholars. Herwig Wolfram, a historian of the Goths,&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Thomas J. Dunlap, tr. ''History of the Goths'' (1979) 1988:5&lt;/ref&gt; in discussing the equation of ''migratio gentium'' with ''{{lang|de|Völkerwanderung}}'', observes that Michael Schmidt introduced the equation in his 1778 history of the Germans. Wolfram observed that the significance of ''[[gens]]'' as a biological community was shifting, even during the [[early Middle Ages]] and that "to complicate matters, we have no way of devising a terminology that is not derived from the concept of [[nationhood]] created during the [[French Revolution]]".

The "primordialistic"&lt;ref&gt;Anthony D. Smith, ''The Ethnic Origins of Nations'' (Oxford, 1966) pp. 6ff., coined the term to separate these thinkers from those who view ethnicity as a situational construct, the product of history, rather than a cause, influenced by a variety of political, economic and cultural factors.&lt;/ref&gt; paradigm prevailed during the 19th century. Scholars, such as German linguist [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], viewed tribes as coherent biological (racial) entities, using the term to refer to discrete ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Noble|2006|p = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that the ''Volk'' were an organic whole, with a core identity and spirit evident in art, literature and language. These characteristics were seen as intrinsic, unaffected by external influences, even conquest.&lt;ref name="harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 46"&gt;{{harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language, in particular, was seen as the most important expression of ethnicity. They argued that groups sharing the same (or similar) language possessed a common identity and ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;That was influenced by the 'family tree' model (''{{lang|de|Stammbaun}}'') of linguistics in that relationships between related languages were seen to be the result of derivation from a [[common descent|common ancestor]]. The model still is very influential in linguistics&lt;/ref&gt; This was the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] ideal that there once had been a single German, Celtic or Slavic people who originated from a common homeland and spoke a [[lingua franca|common tongue]], helping to provide a [[conceptual framework]] for [[political movement]]s of the 18th and 19th centuries such as [[Pan-Germanism]] and [[Pan-Slavism]].&lt;ref name="harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 46" /&gt;

From the 1960s, a reinterpretation of archaeological and historic evidence prompted scholars, such as Goffart and Todd, to propose new models for explaining the construction of barbarian identity. They maintained that no sense of shared identity was perceived by the ''Germani'';&lt;ref name="Halsall 2008 17"&gt;{{harvtxt|Halsall|2008|p = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Todd|pp = 8–10}} There is no indication that the Germani possessed a feeling that they were a "separate people, nation, or group of tribes"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Noble|p = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; a similar theory having been proposed for Celtic and Slavic groups.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The Celtic World'', Miranda Green (1996), p. 3 and ''The Making of the Slavs''. Floring Curta (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

A theory states that the primordialist mode of thinking was encouraged by a ''[[prima facie]]'' interpretation of [[Greco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman]] sources, which grouped together many tribes under such labels as ''Germanoi'', ''Keltoi'' or ''Sclavenoi'', thus encouraging their perception as distinct peoples. Modernists argue that the uniqueness perceived by specific groups was based on common political and [[economic interest]]s rather than biological or racial distinctions.

The role of language in constructing and maintaining group identity can be ephemeral since large-scale language shifts occur commonly in history.&lt;ref&gt;''Archaeology and LanguageL:Correlating Archaeological and Linguistic Hypotheses''. "The Eurasian Spread Zone and the Indo-European Dispersal." [[Johanna Nichols]]. pp. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Modernists propose the idea of "imagined communities"; the barbarian polities in late antiquity were social constructs rather than unchanging lines of blood kinship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of forming tribal units was called "[[ethnogenesis]]", a term coined by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scholar [[Yulian Bromley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Halsall|2008|p = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian school (led by Reinhard Wenskus) popularized this idea, which influenced medievalists such as Herwig Wolfram, Walter Pohl and Patrick Geary.&lt;ref name="Halsall 2008 17" /&gt; It argues that the stimulus for forming tribal polities was perpetuated by a small nucleus of people, known as the ''{{lang|de|Traditionskern}}'' ("kernel of tradition"), who were a military or aristocratic elite. This core group formed a standard for larger units, gathering adherents by employing amalgamative metaphors such as kinship and aboriginal commonality and claiming that they perpetuated an ancient, divinely-sanctioned lineage.&lt;ref name="harvtxt|Geary|2003|p = 77"&gt;{{harvtxt|Geary|2003|p = 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The common, track-filled map of the ''{{lang|de|Völkerwanderung}}'' may illustrate such [a] course of events, but it misleads. Unfolded over long periods of time, the changes of position that took place were necessarily irregular&amp;nbsp;... (with) periods of emphatic discontinuity. For decades and possibly centuries, the tradition bearers idled, and the tradition itself hibernated. There was ample time for forgetfulness to do its work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Noble|2006|p = 97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Viewpoints ===
Historians have postulated several explanations for the appearance of "barbarians" on the Roman frontier: weather and crops, population pressure, a "primeval urge" to push into the Mediterranean or the "domino effect" of the Huns falling upon the Goths who, in turn, pushed other Germanic tribes before them. Entire barbarian tribes (or nations) flooded into [[Roman province]]s,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} ending classical [[urbanism]] and beginning new types of rural settlements.&lt;ref name="fouracre35"&gt;{{harvtxt|Halsall|2006|loc=chpt. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, French and Italian scholars have tended to view this as a catastrophic event, the destruction of a civilization and the beginning of a "Dark Age" that set Europe back a millennium.&lt;ref name="fouracre35" /&gt; In contrast, German and English historians have tended to see Roman/Barbarian interaction as the replacement of a "tired, effete and decadent Mediterranean civilization" with a "more virile, martial, Nordic one".&lt;ref name="fouracre35" /&gt;

Rather than "invasion", German and Slavic scholars speak of "migration" ({{lang-de|Völkerwanderung}}, {{lang-cs|Stěhování národů}}, {{lang-sv|folkvandring}} and {{lang-hu|népvándorlás}}), aspiring to the idea of a dynamic and "wandering [[Indo-European languages|Indo-Germanic]] people".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Noble|p = 236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar [[Guy Halsall]] has seen the barbarian movement as the result of the fall of the Roman Empire, not its cause.&lt;ref name="fouracre35" /&gt; Archaeological finds have confirmed that Germanic and Slavic tribes were settled agriculturalists&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Noble|p = 247}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were probably merely "drawn into the politics of an empire already falling apart for quite a few other causes". The [[Crisis of the Third Century]] caused significant changes within the Roman Empire in both its western and its eastern portions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Curta|2001|P = 120}} ''[T]he archaeological evidence of late fourth- and fifth-century barbarian graves between the Rhine and Loire suggests that a process of small-scale cultural and demographic change took place on both sides of the Roman frontier. Can we envisage Roman-Slavic relations in a similar way?''&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, economic fragmentation removed many of the political, cultural and economic forces that had held the empire together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Halsall|2006|p = 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rural population in Roman provinces became distanced from the metropolis, and there was little to differentiate them from other peasants across the Roman frontier. In addition, Rome increasingly used foreign mercenaries to defend itself. That "barbarisation" parallelled changes within ''barbaricum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

For example, the Roman Empire played a vital role in building up barbarian groups along its frontier. Propped up with imperial support and gifts, the armies of allied barbarian chieftains served as buffers against other, hostile, barbarian groups. The disintegration of Roman [[economic power]] weakened groups that had come to depend on Roman gifts for the maintenance of their own power. The arrival of the Huns helped prompt many groups to invade the provinces for economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Halsall|2006|p = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of the barbarian takeover of former Roman provinces varied from region to region. For example, in [[Aquitaine]], the provincial administration was largely self-reliant. Halsall has argued that local rulers simply "handed over" military rule to the [[Ostrogoths]], acquiring the identity of the newcomers.&lt;ref name="halsall51" /&gt; In [[Gaul]], the collapse of imperial rule resulted in anarchy: the Franks and [[Alamanni|Alemanni]] were pulled into the ensuing "power vacuum",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Halsall|2006|p = 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in conflict. In [[Spain]], local aristocrats maintained independent rule for some time, raising their own armies against the [[Vandals]]. Meanwhile, the Roman withdrawal from [[Lowland England]] resulted in conflict between [[Saxons]] and the Brythonic chieftains (whose centres of power retreated westward as a result). The [[Eastern Roman Empire]] attempted to maintain control of the Balkan provinces despite a thinly-spread imperial army relying mainly on local militias and an extensive effort to refortify the Danubian ''limes''. The ambitious fortification efforts collapsed, worsening the impoverished conditions of the local populace and resulting in colonization by Slavic warriors and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Curta|2001|pp = 120–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halsall and Noble have argued that such changes stemmed from the breakdown in Roman political control, which exposed the weakness of local Roman rule. Instead of large-scale migrations, there were military takeovers by small groups of warriors and their families, who usually numbered only in the tens of thousands. The process involved active, conscious decision-making by Roman provincial populations.

The collapse of centralized control severely weakened the sense of Roman identity in the provinces, which may explain why the provinces then underwent dramatic cultural changes even though few barbarians settled in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Halsall|2006|pp = 50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the Germanic groups in the [[Western Roman Empire]] were accommodated without "dispossessing or overturning indigenous society", and they maintained a structured and hierarchical (but attenuated) form of Roman administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Noble|p = 251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, they lost their unique identity as a result of such an  accommodation and were absorbed into Latinhood. In contrast, in the east, Slavic tribes maintained a more "spartan and egalitarian"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Barford|2001|p = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; existence bound to the land "even in times when they took their part in plundering Roman provinces".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pohl1998|p = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their organizational models were not Roman, and their leaders were not normally dependent on Roman gold for success. Thus they arguably had a greater effect on their region than the Goths, the Franks or the [[Saxons]] had on theirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Geary|2003|p = 146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnicity ===
Based on the belief that particular types of artifacts, elements of personal adornment generally found in a funerary context, are thought to indicate the race and/or ethnicity of the person buried, the "Culture-History" school of archaeology assumed that archaeological cultures represent the ''{{lang|de|[[Urheimat]]}}'' (homeland) of tribal polities named in historical sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pohl|1998|pp = 17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the shifting extensions of material cultures were interpreted as the expansion of peoples.&lt;ref name="Kulikowski 2007 61"&gt;{{harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[social constructionism|constructionism]], process-driven archaeologists rejected the [[cultural-history archaeology|Culture-Historical]] doctrine&lt;ref name="Kulikowski 2007 61" /&gt; and marginalized the discussion of ethnicity altogether and focused on the intragroup dynamics that generated such material remains. Moreover, they argued that adoption of new cultures could occur through trade or internal political developments rather than only military takeovers.

'''Mohamed Talbi''' ({{lang-ar|محمد الطالبي}}), (16 September 1921&lt;ref name="dialogue"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZafJ7LR0a2oC&amp;pg=PA136 Ataullah Siddiqui, ''Christian-Muslim dialogue in the twentieth century'', éd. Palgrave Macmillan, Londres, 1998, p. 136]&lt;/ref&gt; – 1 May 2017) was a Tunisian historian and professor. He was the author of many books about Islam.

==Biography==
[[Emeritus|Professor Emeritus]] at [[University of Tunis]], Mohamed Talbi was a [[Tunisia]]n [[historian]], Islamologist and scholar who authored a number of books and articles on the history of Islam and the [[Maghreb]]. Born in Tunis in 1921 and educated there and later in [[Paris]], Talbi had an illustrious career, both as a historian of medieval [[North Africa]] and as a major theoretical thinker on Islam's nature and mission in the modern world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.resetdoc.org/story/a-religion-of-dialogue-muhammad-talbi/|title=A Religion of Dialogue: Muhammad Talbi|date=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Among Talbi's modern interests were religion and politics, Islam and [[democracy]], Islam and [[human rights]], women in Islam and Islam and religious pluralism, in the wider context of his general thinking on Qur'anic exegesis, historical analysis and religious epistemology. In his discussions of these subjects, Talbi made clear his dependence on the [[Quran]] and other traditional religious sources, while evincing also an easy incorporation of certain modern Western Ideas. Indeed, Talbi's own description of his upbringing and education in Tunisia, and in particular his doctoral studies in post-War Paris, reflected a relaxed attitude towards synthesising Islamic and modern Western thought, in both of which he possessed the requisite learning to effect such an integration. Talbi died on 1 May 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/266941.aspx|title=Tunisian historian and Islam expert Talbi dead at 95|date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Career==
Mohamed Talbi devoted the best part of his career to teaching and researching medieval Maghreb and [[Mediterranean history]]. His profile was that of an atypical intellectual. After a long career teaching in primary and secondary schools, Talbi took and passed the Arab Studies competitive examination. On the eve of Tunisia's independence, he joined the Institute of Higher Education of Tunis. In 1955, he became the first [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the School of Letter and Human Sciences of Tunis. He also chaired the school's history departement before devoting his full energies as director of the scientific journal ''{{ill|Les Cahiers de Tunisie|fr}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.leaders.com.tn/article/24525-mohamed-talbi-un-strenuushistoriaescriptor|title=Mohamed Talbi: un historien dans son siècle|date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1968, Talbi defended his [[Ph.D.]] thesis at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. Entitled ''The Aghlabid Emirate, a political History'', it discusses Tunisia's first Muslim dynasty. Written with clarity and a forcefulness of expression, and supported by solid Arab and Latin sources, Talbi's thesis contributed greatly to a renewed understanding of a key period in the history of [[Ifriqiya]] and eastern Maghreb and the region's relationships with southern Italy. It also earned Talbi a place as one of the founders of the new school of Tunisian and Maghreb history&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://en.qantara.de/content/remembering-mohamed-talbi-tunisian-islam-expert-and-historian|title=Remembering Mohamed Talbi, Tunisian Islam expert and historian|date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Prolix and incisive, Talbi wrote a considerable number of articles and essays. He was one of a rare few to have addressed the history of slavery, and the key role played by slaves, in agriculture and economy. 

Near the end of the 1990s, Talbi turned his reflections toward a deep and systematic meditation. His small book called ''Universality of the Quran'' is a lucid essay of synthesis and analysis. It is primarily in Talbi's latest writing that the historian adopted the style of a polemicist. Talbi was appointed president of the [[Tunisian Academy of Sciences, Letters, and Arts]] between 2011 and 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.omanobserver.om/tunisian-historian-talbi-dead-95/|title=Tunisian historian Talbi dead at 95|date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Views==
Talbi rejected the direct association between [[Shura]] and democracy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iemed.org/actualitat-en/noticies/the-tunisian-historian-mohamed-talbi-rejects-the|title=The Tunisian historian Mohamed Talbi rejects the sharia|date=2001-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He argues that, while desirable in itself, shura is from a time and place which had no conception of democracy as we know it. Indeed, says Talbi, neither [[Islam]] nor Western civilisation had this democratic conception before the modern period, when democracy, as political idea and practice was born- at least not democracy in our modern meaning of the term&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://en.qantara.de/content/mohamed-talbi-religious-dogmas-terrorize-the-spirit|title=Mohamed Talbi : ''Religious Dogmas Terrorize the Spirit''|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For Talbi, democracy meant the voice of the people determining who rules and how they rule, with the associated notions of universal human rights, [[freedom]] of expression, religious pluralism and equality before the law. True democracy was for Talbi the proper political form for our age, as it embodies those values which for him constitute part of the original true Islam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/flash-actualite-monde/deces-de-mohamed-talbi-islamologue-tunisien-engage-01-05-2017-6906405.php|title=(in French) Décès de Mohamed Talbi, islamologue tunisien engagé|date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

During thirty years, Talbi has participated in a number of official and personal dialogues with Christians in [[North Africa]] and [[Europe]]. In an article on Islam and the West, published in 1987, he complains about the current poverty of Muslim initiatives or even responses to Euro-Arab or Islamo-Christian dialogue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ibraaz.org/usr/library/documents/main/interview-with-mohamed-talbi.pdf|title=Interview with Mohamed Talbi|date=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In a prochure on the subject, he explicitly declared Islam to be open to dialogue with other faiths and cultures. For Talbi, the Muslim-Christian dialogue is not just a social event but a significant religious matter, and he has done everything possible to promote such dialogue in [[Tunisia]] and elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://thearabweekly.com/tunisian-islamic-scholar-mohamed-talbi-fierce-opponent-fundamentalism|title=Tunisian Islamic scholar Mohamed Talbi, a fierce opponent of fundamentalism|date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3133">'''Mir-Khwānd''' (Mohammad ibn Khwāndshāh ibn Mahmud, written also as Mīr-Kh&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;ānd, Mirkhond, and other variants; 1433/1434–1498) was a noted Persian-language historian of the fifteenth century. He is known in Latin and Greek as '''Mirchond'''.

==Life==
Born in 1433 in [[Bukhara]], present-day [[Uzbekistan]], the son of a pious man belonging to an old Bukhāran family of [[sayyid|sādah]] or direct descendants of [[Muhammad]], Mir-Khwānd grew up and died in [[Balkh]]. From his early youth he applied himself to historical studies and literature in general.&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;Henry Miers Elliot, ''The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians: The Muhammadan Period'', ed. John Dowson (London: Trübner and Co., 1872), 127-129; [http://worldcat.org/oclc/3425271 OCLC 3425271], available in full text from [https://www.google.com/books?id=atgNAAAAIAAJ Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Herat]], [[Afghanistan]], where Mir-Khwānd spent the greater part of his life, he gained the favor of a famous patron of letters, [[Ali-Shir Nava'i]] (1440–1501), who served his old schoolfellow, the reigning [[Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqara]] (''r''. 1469–1506), the last [[Timurid dynasty|Tīmūrid]] ruler in [[Iran]], first as keeper of the seal, afterwards as governor of Jurjan. At the request of Mir ʿAli-Shir, himself a distinguished statesman and writer, Mir-Khwānd began about 1474, in the quiet [[khanqah]] of Khilashyah, which his patron had founded in Herat as a house of retreat for literary men of merit, his great work on [[universal history]], the ''[[Rawżat aṣ-ṣafāʾ]]'' ({{lang-ar|روضة الصفا}} "Garden of Purity").

{{Sound change}}
{{IPA notice}}
In [[phonetics]], '''nasalization''' (or '''nasalisation''') is the production of a sound while the [[soft palate|velum]] is lowered, so that some air escapes through the nose during the production of the sound by the mouth. An archetypal nasal sound is {{IPA|[n]}}.

In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], nasalization is indicated by printing a [[tilde]] diacritic {{unichar|0303|COMBINING TILDE|html=|cwith=&amp;#x25cc;}} above the symbol for the sound to be nasalized: {{IPA|[ã]}} is the nasalized equivalent of {{IPA|[a]}}, and {{IPA|[ṽ]}} is the nasalized equivalent of {{IPA|[v]}}. A subscript diacritic {{IPA|[ą]}}, called an [[ogonek]] or [[nosinė]], is sometimes seen, especially when the vowel bears [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] marks that would interfere with the superscript tilde. For example, {{IPA|[ą̄ ą́ ą̀ ą̂ ą̌]}} are more legible in most fonts than {{IPA|[ã̄ ã́ ã̀ ã̂ ã̌]}}.

==Nasal vowels==
Nasal vowels are found in various languages around the world, such as [[French language|French]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Hindi]], [[Hmong language|Hmong]], [[Hokkien]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]]. Those nasal vowels contrast with [[oral vowel]]s. Many languages, however, have only oral vowels or do not contrast oral and nasal vowels.

There are occasional cases for vowels showing contrasting degrees of nasality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. One such is [[Palantla Chinantec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolutionary Phonology: The Emergence of Sound Patterns|author=Juliette Blevins|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nasal consonants==
By far the most common nasal sounds are [[nasal consonant]]s such as {{IPA|[m]}}, {{IPA|[n]}} or {{IPA|[ŋ]}}. Most nasal consonants are occular, and airflow through the mouth is blocked and redirected through the nose. Their oral counterparts are the [[stop consonant|stops]].

==Nasalized consonants==
Nasalized versions of other consonant sounds also exist but are much rarer than either nasal occlusives or nasal vowels. Some [[Modern South Arabian languages|South Arabian languages]] use [[phonemic]] nasalized fricatives, such as {{IPA|/z̃/}}, which sounds something like a simultaneous {{IPA|[n]}} and {{IPA|[z]}}. The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Rime table|consonant]] [[wikt:日|日]] ''r''- ({{clarification needed|text={{IPA|[ȵʑ]}}|reason=What form of Chinese is this transcribing?|date=July 2018}}) has an odd history; for example, it has evolved into {{IPAblink|ʐ}} and {{IPA|[ɑɻ]}} (or {{IPAblink|ɻ}} and {{IPAblink|ɚ}} respectively, depending on accents) in [[Standard Chinese]]; {{IPAblink|z}}/{{IPAblink|ʑ}} and {{IPAblink|n}} in [[Hokkien]];  {{IPA|[z]}}/{{IPA|[ʑ]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}/{{IPAblink|ɲ|n̠ʲ}} while borrowed into Japan. It seems likely that it was once a nasalized fricative, perhaps a palatal {{IPA|[ʝ̃]}}.

In [[Coatzospan Mixtec]], fricatives and affricates are nasalized before nasal vowels even when they are voiceless. In the [[Hupa language|Hupa]], the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|/ŋ/}} often has the tongue not make full contact, resulting in a nasalized approximant, {{IPA|[ɰ̃]}}. That is [[cognate]] with a [[Nasal_palatal_approximant|nasalized palatal approximant]]] {{IPA|[ȷ̃]}} in other [[Athabaskan languages]].

In [[Umbundu language|Umbundu]], phonemic {{IPA|/ṽ/}} contrasts with the ([[allophone|allophonically]]) nasalized approximate {{IPA|[w̃]}} and so is likely to be a true fricative rather than an approximate.{{Elucidate|date=April 2010}} In [[Old Irish|Old]] and [[Middle Irish]], the [[lenition|lenited]] {{angbr|m}} was a nasalized bilabial fricative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Grammar of Old Irish |last=Thurneysen |first=Rudolf |authorlink=Rudolf Thurneysen |author2=D. A. Binchy|translator=Osborn Bergin|year=1946 |publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies |location=Dublin |isbn=1-85500-161-6 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] has an allophonic nasalized [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ̃]}}; nasalized stops can occur only with pharyngeal articulation or lower, or they would be simple nasals.&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL|134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasal [[flap consonant|flaps]] are common allophonically. Many West African languages have a nasal flap {{IPA|[ɾ̃]}} (or {{IPA|[n̆]}}) as an allophone of {{IPA|/ɾ/}} before a nasal vowel; [[Pashto language|Pashto]], however, has a phonemic nasal [[retroflex lateral flap]].

Other languages, such as the [[Khoisan languages]] of [[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoe]] and [[Gǀui dialect|Gǀui]], as well as several of the [[!Kung language]]s, include [[nasal click]] consonants. Nasalization of the phonemes is denoted with a superscript {{angbr|ᵑ}} preceding the consonant (for example, {{angbr|ᵑǂ}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL|268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasalized laterals such as {{IPA|[l̃]}} are easy to produce but rare or nonexistent as phonemes; often when {{IPA|[l]}} is nasalized, it becomes {{IPA|[n]}}.

==True nasal fricatives==
{{anchor|nareal|Nareal}}
Besides nasalized oral fricatives, there are true nasal fricatives, previously called ''nareal fricatives''. They are sometimes produced by people with disordered speech. The [[turbulence]] in the airflow characteristic of [[fricative]]s is produced not in the mouth but in the [[nasal cavity]]. A tilde and [[trema (diacritic)|trema]] diacritic (two dots representing the nostrils) is used for this in the [[extensions to the IPA]]: {{IPA|[n͋]}} is a voiced alveolar nasal fricative, with no airflow out of the mouth, and {{IPA|[n̥͋]}} is the voiceless equivalent; {{IPA|[v͋]}} is an oral fricative with simultaneous nasal frication. No known language makes use of nasal fricatives in non-disordered speech.

==Denasalization==
{{Main article|Denasalization}}
Nasalization may be lost over time. There are also [[Denasalization|denasal]] sounds, which sound like nasals spoken with a head cold. They may be found in non-pathological speech as a language loses nasal consonants, as in [[Korean language|Korean]].

==Contextual nasalization==

Vowels assimilate to surrounding [[nasal consonant]]s in many languages, such as [[Thai language|Thai]], creating nasal vowel allophones. Some languages exhibit a nasalization of [[Segment (linguistics)|segments]] adjacent to phonemic or allophonic [[nasal vowels]], such as [[Apurinã language|Apurinã]].

Contextual nasalization can lead to the addition of nasal vowel phonemes to a language.&lt;ref&gt;The World Atlas of Language Structures Online – [http://wals.info/feature/description/10 Chapter 10 – Vowel Nasalization]&lt;/ref&gt; That happened in French, most of whose final consonants disappeared, but its final nasals made the preceding vowels become nasal, which introduced a new distinction into the language. An example is ''vin blanc'' {{IPA-fr|vɛ̃ blɑ̃|}} ('white wine'), ultimately from [[Latin]] ''vinum'' and ''blancum''.

In [[heraldry]] and [[architecture]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Nebuly Nebuly - definition of Nebuly by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], thefreedictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; a line which is drawn '''nebuly''' (or '''nebulée''') is made up of a series of bulbous protrusions, which are supposed to resemble clouds. The term is derived from the Latin word ''nebula'', "a mist, vapor, or cloud" (OED). A nebuly line [[meander]]s in one direction describing the shape of three-quarters of a circle, then similarly in the other direction, maintaining a straight overall trajectory. A fess nebuly is a fess where the two horizontal lines of the fess are nebuly. A shield formed of several such fesses, termed bars where in excess of one, is ''barry nebuly''.

==Construction==
A nebuly line is constructed from two identically spaced rows of circles, one row placed beneath the other in such a way that each circle in each row touches another two circles tangentially, which is effected by the horizontal shunting of one of the rows. Each circle in the lower row should touch the two above at about 45 and 135 degrees and each circle in the upper row should touch the two below at 225 and 315 degrees.

==Examples==
The mediaeval arms of the Dauntsey family of Wiltshire, England, were ''barry nebuly''. Its use in coats of arms can be seen in the cases of [http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=899&amp;ShowAll=1 Jones] and [http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=1074&amp;ShowAll=1 Munk], both Canada,  [http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/lancs_pre74.html FLEETWOOD BOROUGH COUNCIL, England] and [http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/cheshire_pre74.html HYDE BOROUGH COUNCIL, England]

'''Petrus Olai''' (Peder Olsen, ca. 1490–ca. 1570) was a  Danish Franciscan friar and historiographer.
No details about his life are known. He refers to himself as ''Petro Olavo Saneropio Minoritano''  in a [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] of his '''''Collectanea ad historiam danicam pertinentia'''''. A later note in the same manuscript by Anders Sørensen Vedel (fol. 171v) suggests that he was dead by c. 1570.

He was presumably a monk in [[Greyfriars Cemetery, Roskilde|Roskilde monastery]], for which reason [[Claus Christoffersen Lyschander|Lyschander]] (ca. 1620) refers to him as ''Petrus Olai Roschildensis''. The byname ''Saneropius'' refers to Sonnerup parish (now in [[Lejre Municipality]]), some 10&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Roskilde]].

Petrus likely began his ''Collectanea'' in c. 1515, when he was still a young monk, as a personal notebook.
From c. 1522, he was employed by his order to write a chronicle about the Franciscans in Scandinavia. After [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|the Reformation]]  (in 1537) the order was dissolved in Denmark, but Petrus continued his work on Danish history until c. 1560, as '''''Danorum Gesta'''''.

The manuscript of ''Collectanea ad historiam danicam pertinentia'' (AM 107 8°, 172 folia) is a notebook with complicated structure, extended by numerous extra pages and loose slips of paper, and numerous interlinear and marginal notes, and has never been edited in its entirety.
 
The ''Danorum Gesta'', on the other hand, is a coherent text. It is extant in  the manuscripts Uppsala University Library DG 37, 86 folia, and Copenhagen, Royal Library, GKS 2461 4° (92 folia).
It treats the [[history of Denmark]] from 1191 to 1559, but it contains little original information.
The two manuscripts contain the same text from 1319, with only the Uppsala ms. containing the portion of 1191 to 1318. Both are near-contemporary copies but not autographs.
The greater part of the text consists of excerpts from the ''Collectanea''; the ''Gesta'' is, in fact, the systematic synthesis of the material collected over the years in his notebook. It represents  the first effort at a coherent "Continuation of Saxo", as presented with more lasting influence (and in print) by [[Arild Huitfeldt|Arild Hvidtfeldt]] in 1600.

The ''Colectanea'' were extensively used by other historians already during Petrus' lifetime, notably by Paulus Helie for his ''Skiby-chronicle'', by Hans Svaning and by Anders Sørensen Vedel who inherited the ''Colectanea'' ms. after Petrus' death. Arne Magnusson acquired the ms. in 1726 and  partial editions of the texts were published in ''Scriptores rerum Danicarum'' by [[Jakob Langebek]] beginning in 1772.&lt;ref&gt;
1772: Scriptores rerum Danicarum 1: “Series et brevior historia regum Danie,” 64–68 = Coll. fol. 38. (Cf. GERTZ (ed.) 1918), “Chronica regum danorum, a Dano ad obitum Johannis regis,” 68–148 = Coll. fol. 1–39 and 68–91 (with many omissions and without the marginal notes). “Annales rerum danicarum a Cimbrorum exitu ad An. Chr. 1541,” 171–97 = Coll. 9–39 and 68–91, (insertions and marginal notes). “Anonymi Roskildensis Chronica Danicum ab An. 826–1157,” 373–87 = Coll. fol. 145–159 (copy by Petrus Olai), (Cf. GERTZ 1918: “Chronica Roskildense”)
1773: Scriptores rerum Danicarum 2: “Excerpta Normannica et Danica ab An. 841 ad 1050,” 10–17 = Coll. fol. 33–34 and 36 (partially). “Excerpta ex historicis Danorum, a Suenone Tiugskæg ad Ericum Menved”, 203–65 = Coll. fol. 40–66.
1774: Scriptores rerum Danicarum 3: “Historia Martyrizationis S. Kanuti regis,” 322–25 = Coll. fol. 8–9 (cf. commentaries by GERTZ 1908–1912: Vitae Sanctorum Danorum, 51–53.)
1783: Scriptores rerum Danicarum 5: “Historia de inchoatione et propagatione ordinis fratrum minorum in Dania et regionibus septentrionalibus,” 511–28 = Coll. fol. 106–121 (cf. GERTZ 1922: “De ordine fratrum minorum”). “Historia mirabilium in Ecclesia B. Petri Slesvici factorum,” 581–82 = Coll. fol. 75.
1786: Scriptores rerum Danicarum 6: “Archiepiscopi Hamburgenses,” 608–10 = Coll. fol. 94–96. “Frustrum chronici Episcoporum Lundensium,” 638–39 = Coll. fol.81?
1792: Scriptores rerum Danicarum 7: “Episcopi Roschildenses,” 152–55 = Coll. fol. 102.
1834: Scriptores rerum Danicarum 8: “Duodecim excellentiæ regni Daciæ”, 493–502 = Coll. fol. 133–139.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Danorum Gesta'' was translated in part (for the period 1448–1559) into Danish, as the ''Roskilde-årbogen'', which would be very influential in the decades leading up to the publication of Arild Hvidtfeldt's ''Danske Krønike'' in 1600.&lt;ref&gt;RØRDAM, H.F. 1873: “Roskildeårbogen fra 1448–1549,” Monumenta historiæ Danicæ 1. ser. 1, 297–381 (the abridged Danish excerpt of ”Danorum Gesta” from the 16th century).
RØRDAM, H.F. 1887: “Danorum Gesta post chronica Saxonis facta (1191–1559),” Monumenta historiæ Danicæ 2. ser. 2, 1–33 (only fragments treating the periods 1241–1275 and 1552–1559).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Hart – who self-identified as a [[Marxist]] – was one of four PNP members who were expelled from the PNP for their (alleged) communist views.&lt;ref name=Gleaner1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orville Taylor, [http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120520/focus/focus1.html "Workers' 'Weak': 50 Years Of Betrayal"], ''The Gleaner'', 20 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The other three members were Frank Hill, Ken Hill and Arthur Henry, and they were collectively referred to as "the four Hs".&lt;ref name=Campbell2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] – [http://www.whodoyouthinkyouaremagazine.com/episode/john-barnes The footballer traces his grandfather's central role in the campaign for Jamaican independence"], ''[[Who Do You Think You Are?

Believing in the importance of popular education to empower people and raise the level of political consciousness in the community – to which his first book, ''The Origin and Development of the People of Jamaica'' (1952), was dedicated – Hart helped establish the People's Educational Organisation (PEO), which organized a bookshop and held meetings and debates, including on the type of political party that was needed.&lt;ref name=HDrayton1&gt;Harold A.

===Guyana===

After the demise of the People's Freedom Movement, Hart moved to [[Guyana]], where he worked as the editor of ''The Mirror'' newspaper, which supported the views of [[Cheddi Jagan]],&lt;ref name=GrenadaRevOnline&gt;[http://www.thegrenadarevolutiononline.com/hart.html "Richard Hart", The Grenada Revolution Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; from 1963 to 1965.&lt;ref name=Luquesi /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart1 /&gt; While in Guyana, Hart also undertook research into the history and culture of the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak people]], making many visits to Amerindian communities in the interior.&lt;ref name=HDrayton2&gt;Harold A.

===London===
On leaving Guyana, Hart moved to London, England, where he worked as a solicitor to a Local Government Authority from 1965 to 1982.&lt;ref name=Gleaner1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart1 /&gt; In 1974, he was a founding member of [[Caribbean Labour Solidarity]] (CLS),&lt;ref name=CLS&gt;[http://www.cls-uk.org.uk/about.html CLS website.]&lt;/ref&gt; together with Cleston Taylor (1926–2010),&lt;ref&gt;Calling Hart and Taylor "two very special and unsung heroes of the Jamaican working-class movement", Winston James dedicates to them his book ''A Fierce Hatred of Injustice: Claude McKay's Jamaica and His Poetry of Rebellion'' (Verso, 2000, pp. xv–xvi): "Dick and Cleston have never forsaken the Caribbean working class and, even in exile and old age, they have worked tirelessly and selflessly to promote its cause. Veterans of the Jamaican labor movement stretching back to the 1930s, in exile they founded together Caribbean Labour Solidarity in London some thirty years ago and, through thick and mainly thin, have remained steadfast in supporting the struggle of the poor and exploited in the Caribbean. Dick and Cleston deserve to be better known, appreciated and celebrated."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Horsley, [http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/index.php/news/layout/set/print/content/view/full/88889 "Obituary: Cleston 'Chris' Taylor"], ''Morning Star'', 7 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Lionel Jeffrey (1926–93)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=14689&amp;inst_id=118&amp;nv1=search&amp;nv2= Jeffrey, Lionel and Pansy (donated papers)], AIM25.&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Hart remained the Honorary President of CLS,&lt;ref name=CLS /&gt; a group that "sets itself the task of informing the concerned about labour issues in the region as a whole".&lt;ref&gt;Harry Goulbourne, ''Black Politics in Britain'', Avebury, 1990, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grenada; return to England===
In 1982, Hart moved to [[Grenada]], where he worked as a legal consultant to the [[People's Revolutionary Government]]. He was appointed [[Attorney General of Grenada]] on 25 May 1983.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gleaner1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GrenadaRevOnline /&gt; An internal power struggle in the leadership of the [[New Jewel Movement]] led to the killing of Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]] and the [[Invasion of Grenada (1983)|US Invasion of Grenada]] that began on 25 October 1983.

Hart returned to England, where he operated a private legal practice for five years until he retired in 1988.&lt;ref name=Gleaner1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart1 /&gt; He contributed an introduction to ''In Nobody's Backyard: Maurice Bishop's Speeches, 1979–1983 – A Memorial Volume'' (Zed Books, 1984), placing the Grenada revolution in a historical context within the Caribbean, and later wrote other works on Grenada, including ''The Grenada Revolution: Setting the Record Straight'' (2005).

===Later years===

Hart was readmitted to the PNP in 2001.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell4 /&gt; In 2004, he was awarded an honorary degree by the [[University of the West of England]].&lt;ref name=UWE /&gt; In 2005, he was presented with a Gold [[Musgrave Medal]] from the [[Institute of Jamaica]] for his "sterling contribution and achievements in the field of historical research both in Jamaica and the Caribbean",&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20051113/social/social2.html "HART, CHEN finally receive Musgrave medals"], ''Jamaica Gleaner'', 13 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Latoya Pennant, [http://www.golocaljamaica.com/readarticle.php?ArticleID=5560 "Thirteen Individuals to Receive 2005 Musgrave Awards"], ''Go Local Jamaica'', 27 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded an honorary doctorate by [[The University of the West Indies]] (UWI).&lt;ref name=Campbell2 /&gt; In June 2006, UWI ran a three-day conference on Hart's work, entitled "Politics, Activism and History: The Life and Times of Richard Hart".&lt;ref name=Campbell2 /&gt; In 2011, he was awarded an honorary degree from the [[University of Hull]].&lt;ref name=Luquesi /&gt;

Hart wrote a number of significant historical works over the years. He was also instrumental in the publication of the first [[Arawak language|Arawak]] dictionary in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stabroeknews.com/2013/features/in-the-diaspora/12/23/richard-hart-august-13-1917-december-21-2013-life-well-lived-service-peoples-caribbean/ "Richard Hart August 13, 1917 – December 21, 2013.

The text is part memoir and part historical account. As a major participant in the labor and political struggles of the 1930s and 1940s, Hart was both observer and actor in the unfolding drama of the process of decolonization."&lt;ref&gt;Linden Lewis, [http://www.uwipress.com/sites/default/files/Towards%20Decolonisation%20Pending.pdf Review of ''Towards Decolonisation: Political, Labour and Economic Developments in Jamaica 1938-1945''], ''New West Indian Guide I Nieuwe West-Indische Gids'', vol. 75, nos. 1 &amp; 2 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Hart's 2012 book, ''Caribbean Workers' Struggles'', "is a wide-ranging and immensely readable essay that gives centre stage to the struggle for workers' rights and national independence against the forces of racism and imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Steve Andrew, [http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/news/content/view/full/125800 Review of ''Caribbean Workers' Struggles''], ''[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Morning Star]]'', 6 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Socialist Review]]'' states: "This book is testimony to the courageous and unceasing struggle from below that won freedom and political rights for a population of slaves."&lt;ref&gt;Susie Helme, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=12149 "Caribbean Workers' Struggles" (review)], ''Socialist Review'', November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; His last published book was ''Occupation &amp; Control: the British in Jamaica 1660–1962'' (2013).

He attended the [[University of Vienna]], the [[Sapienza University of Rome]], and the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]]. In [[World War I]] he served as an officer of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]].

Eisler had a position at the Austrian Historical Institute at the Vienna University. From 1925-31 he served as Assistant Director of the [[League of Nations]] Universities Interrelation Office in [[Paris]] and temporarily held a guest professorship at the [[Sorbonne]].

Before the outbreak of [[World War II]] he could take refuge in the [[United Kingdom]], where he worked as a lecturer at the [[University of Oxford]]. He died in [[Oxted]], [[Surrey]].

Married to Lili von Pausinger, Eisler was the son-in-law of Austrian painter [[Franz Xaver von Pausinger]] (1839–1915). His wife's sister Elisabeth translated [[Johanna Spyri]]'s classic children's book ''[[Heidi]]'' into English and was married to the American writer Charles Wharton Stork (1881–1971).

==Theses==
He advanced controversial theses on the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|Life of Jesus]]. One is about the concept of a political, rebellious and eschatological Jew as Jesus, in relation to the [[Zealot]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/theories.html]: ''In the tradition of [[S. G. F. Brandon]] and Robert Eisler, [[Robert Eisenman]] has argued that the original Jamesian Christianity consisted of Torah-observant and nationalistic Jews of insurrectionist bent.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://inside.bard.edu/religion/facultyproj/temple/temple_jesus/prevappr.htm]:''the notion that Jesus is to be seen chiefly in political terms, a notion which [S. G. F.] Brandon, together with [[H. S. Reimarus]] and Robert Eisler, championed within the world of academic discourse.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moshereiss.org/christianity/02_tradition/02_tradition.htm]: ''Several major scholars in controversial books, Robert Eisler, S. G. F. Brandon and [[Paul Winters]], claim he was a Zealot.''&lt;/ref&gt; In this he is the company of [[Joel Carmichael]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Death of Jesus''&lt;/ref&gt; In arguing for this position he used the work of [[Flavius Josephus]]&lt;ref&gt;Also [[Celsus]] and [[Sossianus Hierocles]].&lt;/ref&gt; in Slavonic manuscripts (the authenticity of which has been questioned).&lt;ref&gt;For example by [[Charles Guignebert]], [[John P. Meier]][http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/testimonium.html].&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Messiah]] he discussed the ''[[afikoman]]'' in 1925, with ideas taken up much later.&lt;ref&gt;By [[David Daube]], see [http://www.hebrew-streams.org/works/judaism/afikoman.html].&lt;/ref&gt; He made much of the Hebrew background of [[John the Baptist]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/gno/gjb/gjb-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

He was described by [[Gershom Scholem]] as 'an astonishing figure in the world of scholarship'.&lt;ref&gt;''Walter Benjamin: The Story of a Friendship'' (English translation, 1982), p.131. Scholem goes on to say ''For all unsolved problems he had in readiness brilliantly false solutions of the most surprising kind. He was a man of unbridled ambition, ceaseless diligence, but rather unstable character.'' Indeed, Eisler held the dubious honor of holding a post at Scholem and Walter Benjmain's fictional [[University of Muri]].&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic was [[Erwin Ramsdell Goodenough]].&lt;ref&gt;See citation [http://members.optusnet.com.au/~gtosiris/page9i.html here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215114015/http://members.optusnet.com.au/~gtosiris/page9i.html |date=2006-12-15 }} from his ''Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman World'', implying Eisler lacked in self-critical acumen.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheldon Lee Gosline'' is an [[United States|American]] [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] who has extensively studied the ancient civilizations of the Far East. He is noted for proposing the existence of a developing literate civilization in southern China dating to the second millennium BCE.

==Biography==
Sheldon Lee Gosline began his professional education at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he received a B.A. degrees in Oriental Studies and Art History in 1985. He later continued his studies at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he received a B.A. degree 1988 and was awarded an M.A. degree in Oriental Studies in 1993.
He interrupted his stay at Cambridge to study at the [[University of Chicago]], receiving an M.A. degree in Egyptology and Near Eastern Archaeology in 1992.
After Cambridge he studied at [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. He received his Ph.D. in 2013 from [[University College London]], where he researched at the [[Wellcome Trust]] Centre for the History of Medicine and the [[UCL Centre for the History of Medicine]]. His thesis concerned the intersection of business and medicine.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYC&gt;[https://www.explorers.org/events/detail/nyc_public_lecture_series_feat_sheldon_gosline ''The Explorers Club''], NYC Public Lecture Series Featuring Sheldon Gosline (8 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gosline is owner of Shangri-La Publications Art Design and Shangrila Gifts based in Warren Center, PA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shangri-La Publications Art Design and Shangrila Gifts|url=http://shangri-la.0catch.com/|publisher=Shangri-La|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.shangri-la.0catch.com|url=http://www.roadurls.com/www.shangri-la.0catch.com|website=Road Url|publisher=Road Url|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosline has taught at Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; and at UW-Madison. He was at Northeast Normal University through 2004.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; 
In 2011, he moved to London to pursue a Ph.D. in the history of medicine, at [[University College London]]. Once he completed the degree, he returned to China to research the writing of the country’s minority groups.  He was first a visiting professor at [[Minzu University of China]] and [[Tsinghua University]], both in Beijing.  Since 2015, he has taught medical humanities at [[Peking University]]. He is a member of several professional associations.

He states that he has become proficient in or conversant with nine contemporary or ancient languages.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;[http://shangri-la.0catch.com/press/vitae.html] ''Vitae of Prof. Sheldon Lee Gosline'' (shangri-la website; accessed 21 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lost civilization theory==
IN 2013 Gosline was shown some inscriptions found in [[Guangxi]] province and considered that several were based on the [[Indus script]] and Persian cuneiform. On a field trip to the area where they were found in 2014 he discovered what he considered evidence of further inscriptions made up of large rocks regularly spaced and what he called “a man-made platform of megalithic construction" and something that “appeared to be a carved chair or throne.”   Sitting on it he “sensed a harmony and that I was in the midst of an ancient time calculating device".&lt;ref name=NYC/&gt; He returned to what he called an "observatory complex" with caver including royal burials in June 2014 with a group of researchers who examined the site and stated that “We confirmed most of the things I’d found as potential alignments, and we confirmed that there was artifact evidence in the area that showed human occupation.” He reported this in a talk to the New York Explorers Club later that year, saying that he believed he had found an unknown civilization. 

Reports from Chinese researchers who accompanied him were less positive. Dr. Ye Xiaohong reported that "Two suspected cave tombs are not man-made," "No artificial traces were found on the huge stone in the suspected artificial remains, neither the suspected structures for observation nor the suspected ancient topographic maps" and that what Gosline had interpreted as ancient writing on some rocks "were certainly produced by natural force".&lt;ref name="Ye"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ye|first1=Xiaohong|title=Preliminary Observation and Cognition at Gansang|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0714/46829.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese researchers also surveyed the alignments that Gosline thought related to the chair (which they agreed was a natural water-created formation) and concluded that the stone could not have been used as part of an observatory. &lt;ref name="Xu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xu|first1=Fengxian|title=A Survey of Gansang site and Further Discussion|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0702/46710.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Chinese researcher who was part of Gosline's group stated that "Gosline proclaimed that he had found several megalithic sites including observatories, palaces, and ancient cave tombs，petro-glyphs and even plan maps at Gansang, Nadou, and Bupeng in Pingguo county, Guangxi".  The conclusion was that "We have not found any artificial remains, artifacts, and occupation layer both at Nadou and Bupeng sites" and that most of the "scratches, the petro-glyphs and plan maps on the rocks called by Gosline, are natural" with a few that might be artificial and needed microscopic examination. However they did believe that the "Gansang site might have worked as an important settlement in Youjiang River Reach." Commenting on the engraved stones reported by Gosline, they commented that they seemed too new, that they were too intact with "the whole texts just fit to the sizes of the planks", that they lacked an archaeological context and that there were too few repetitions of characters.&lt;ref name="Nu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nu|first1=He|title=Thinking about the Sites in Pingguo county, S China|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0702/46706.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosline’s observation that the newly discovered inscriptions seemed to include Persian cuneiform is unproven as of 2016.&lt;ref name=NYC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/did-a-coded-message-lead-an-american-to-a-lost-civilization-in-china?ct=t(Newsletter_4_21_20164_20_2016)&amp;mc_cid=5e86c4b93a&amp;mc_eid=34be11d5e3] Did A Coded Message Lead an American to a Lost Civilization in

'''Sicardus of Cremona''' (Latin: ''Sicardus Cremonensis''; Italian: ''Sicardo'') (1155–1215) was an Italian [[prelate]], historian and writer.

==Biography==

Sicardo was born into a [[Cremona|Cremonese]] family, probably the [[Casalaschi family|Casalaschi]]. He studied law in [[University of Bologna|Bologna]] and [[University of Mainz|Mainz]], then returned to Cremona where he became a [[subdeacon]] in 1183 and [[bishop of Cremona]] in 1185. (''Sicardus episcopus Cremonensis'').

On April 18, 1188, Bishop Sicardo laid the first stone of a new castle to defend Cremona. This was an outpost toward [[Crema, Italy|Crema]], the ''Castrum Leonis'', today [[Castelleone]] ([[Province of Cremona]]).

In 1203 he followed the [[Pontifical legate]] Cardinal [[Peter of Capua]] to the East and during the [[Fourth Crusade]] he was found in [[Constantinople]]. In 1205 Sicardo returned to Cremona where he supported [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] against the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]] of [[Braunschweig]].

Sicardo died in Cremona in 1215.

{{See also|List of Soviet agents in the United States}}
Since the late 1920s, the [[Soviet Union]], through its [[GRU]], [[OGPU]] and [[NKVD]] intelligence services, used Russian and foreign-born nationals as well as [[Communist]], and people of American origin to perform [[espionage]] activities in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Haynes"&gt;[[John Earl Haynes|Haynes, John Earl]], and [[Harvey Klehr|Klehr, Harvey]], ''Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America,'' [[Yale University Press]] (2000)  {{ISBN|0-300-08462-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinstein"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weinstein |first1=Allen |authorlink1=Allen Weinstein |authorlink2=Alexander Vassiliev |last2=Vassiliev |first2=Alexander |title=The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America: The Stalin Era |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;''Retrieved Papers Shed Light On Communist Activities In U.S.'', [[Associated Press]], January 31, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  These various espionage networks had contact with various U.S. government agencies, transmitting  to [[Moscow]] information that would have been deemed confidential.&lt;ref name="Haynes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

==First efforts==
During the 1920s [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet intelligence]] focused on military and industrial espionage in the United States, specifically in the aircraft and munitions industries, and penetrating the mainline federal government bureaucracies, such as the [[United States Department of State]] and [[United States Department of War|War Department]].  {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} These efforts had mixed results.

==Browder and Golos networks==
One chief aim was the infiltration, placement, and subversion of American political life at all levels of society. [[Earl Browder]], [[General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the United States]] (CPUSA), served as an agent recruiter himself on behalf of Soviet intelligence.&lt;ref name="Haynes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sudoplatov"&gt;Sudoplatov, Pavel Anatoli, Schecter, Jerrold L., and Schecter, Leona P., ''Special Tasks: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness&amp;nbsp;— A Soviet Spymaster'', Little Brown, Boston (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Browder later stated that "by the mid-thirties, the Party was not putting its principal emphasis on recruiting members." Left unstated was his intent to use party members for espionage work, where suitable.  Browder advocated the use of a ''United Front'' involving other members of the left, both to strengthen advocacy of pro-Soviet policy and to enlarge the pool of potential recruits for espionage work.  The illegal residency of [[NKVD]] in the US was established in 1934 by the former [[Berlin]] resident [[Boris Bazarov]].&lt;ref name="Andrew"&gt;[[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]] and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]], ''The [[Mitrokhin Archive]]: The KGB in Europe and the West'', Gardners Books (2000), {{ISBN|0-14-028487-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, [[NKVD]] agent [[Iskhak Akhmerov]] entered the US with false identity papers to assist Bazarov in the collection of useful intelligence, and operated without interruption until 1939, when he left the US. Akhmerov's wife, an American who worked for Soviet intelligence, was [[Helen Lowry]] (Elza Akhmerova), the niece of CPUSA General Secretary Earl Browder. Recent information from Soviet archives has revealed that Browder's younger sister Marguerite worked until 1938 as an NKVD operative in Europe.  She discontinued this work only when Browder himself requested her release from duty, fearful that her work would compromise his position as General Secretary.&lt;ref name="Haynes"/&gt;

In the 1930s, the chief Soviet espionage organization operating in the U.S. became the [[GRU]]. [[J. Peters]] headed the secret apparatus that supplied internal government documents from the [[Ware group]] to the GRU. Browder assisted Peters in building a network of operatives in the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. This group included [[Alger Hiss]], [[John Abt]], and [[Lee Pressman]]. Courier for the group at the time was [[Whittaker Chambers]]. Browder oversaw the efforts of [[Jacob Golos]] and his girlfriend, [[Elizabeth Bentley]], whose network of agents and sources included two key figures at the Department of Treasury, [[Greg Silvermaster|Nathan Gregory Silvermaster]] and [[Harry Dexter White]].

One early Soviet spy ring was headed by [[Jacob Golos]].  Jake Golos (birth name Jacob Golosenko, Tasin, Rasin or Raisen) was a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]-born [[Bolshevik]] revolutionary and Soviet [[secret police]] (NKVD) operative in the USSR. He was also a longtime senior official of the CPUSA involved in covert work and cooperation with Soviet intelligence agencies.  He took over an existing network of agents and intelligence sources from Earl Browder.  Golos' controller was the head of the NKVD's American desk, [[Gaik Ovakimian]], also known as "The Puppetmaster", who would later serve a key role in the [[assassination]] of [[Leon Trotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnearlhaynes.org/page44.html Alexander Vassiliev’s Notes on Anatoly Gorsky’s December 1948 Memo on Compromised American Sources and Networks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225204811/http://www.johnearlhaynes.org/page44.html |date=2009-02-25 }}; John Earl Haynes, "KGB officer Gaik Badelovich Ovakimian worked as a Soviet spy in the United States from 1933 until 1941 when he was arrested and deported.  He was identified in the Venona cables under the cover name Gennady. [[Elizabeth Bentley]] reported that Golos identified Ovakimian as his chief contact with the KGB until the arrest."&lt;/ref&gt; Golos was the "main pillar" of the NKVD intelligence network. He had worked with Soviet intelligence from the mid-1930s, and probably earlier. He was not merely a CPUSA official assisting the NKVD (an agent or "probationer" in Soviet intelligence parlance) but held official rank in the NKVD, and claimed to be an oldtime [[Chekism|Chekist]].

Golos established a company called ''World Tourists'' with money from Earl Browder, the General Secretary. The firm, which posed as a travel agency, was used to facilitate international travel to and from the United States by Soviet agents and CPUSA members. World Tourists was also involved in manufacturing fake passports, as Browder used such a false passport on covert trips to the Soviet Union in 1936.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt; At World Tourist, Golos frequently met [[Bernard Schuster]], an NKVD agent (code name ''ECHO'' and ''DICK'') and Communist Party functionary who carried out background investigations for Golos as part of the [[vetting]] process of agent candidates.&lt;ref&gt;VENONA documents NY-MOSCOW, Nos. 1221, 1457, and 1512 (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1940, Golos pleaded guilty to being an unregistered [[Foreign Agents Registration Act|foreign agent]], paid a $500 fine, and served probation in lieu of a four-month prison sentence.

Soviet intelligence did not like Golos' refusal to allow Soviet contact with his sources (a measure implemented by Golos to protect himself and to ensure his continued retention by the NKVD). The NKVD suspected Golos of [[Trotskyism]] and tried to lure him to Moscow, where he could be arrested, but the US government got to him first. But even then, he did not reveal his agent network. After Browder went to prison in 1940, Golos took over running Browder's agents. In 1941, Golos set up a commercial forwarding enterprise, called the US Shipping and Service Corporation, with [[Elizabeth Bentley]], his lover, as one of its officers.&lt;ref name="Haynes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt;

Sometime in November 1943, Golos met in [[New York City]] with key figures of the [[Perlo group]], a group working in several government departments and agencies in [[Washington, D.C.]] The group was already in the service of Browder. Later that same month, after a series of heart attacks over the previous two years, Golos died in bed in Bentley's arms. Bentley then took over his operations (thus the reference in the decrypts to him as a "former" colleague).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Secret apparatus==
By the end of 1936 at least four mid-level [[State Department]] officials were delivering information to Soviet intelligence: [[Alger Hiss]], assistant to Assistant Secretary of State Francis Sayre; [[Julian Wadleigh]], economist in the Trade Agreements Section; [[Laurence Duggan]], Latin American division; and [[Noel Field]], West European division. [[Whittaker Chambers]] later testified that the plans for a tank design with a revolutionary new [[Christie suspension|suspension]] invented by [[J. Walter Christie]] (then being tested in the U.S.A.) were procured and put into production in the Soviet Union as the Mark BT, later developed into the famous Soviet [[T-34]] tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In 1993, experts from the Library of Congress traveled to Moscow to copy previously secret archives of Communist Party USA ([[CPUSA]]) records, sent to the Soviet Union for safekeeping by party organizers. The records provide an irrefutable record of Soviet intelligence and cooperation provided by those in the radical left in the United States from the 1920s through the 1940s.  Some documents revealed that the CPUSA was actively involved in secretly recruiting party members from African-American groups and rural farm workers. The records contained further evidence that Soviet sympathizers had indeed infiltrated the State Department, beginning in the 1930s. Included were letters from two U.S. ambassadors in Europe to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and a senior State Department official. Thanks to an official in the State department sympathetic to the Party, the confidential correspondence, concerning political and economic matters in Europe, ended up in the hands of Soviet intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;''Retrieved Papers Shed Light On Communist Activities In U.S.'', Associated Press, January 31, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s and 1940 the [[OGPU]], known as the Political Directorate, used the U.S. as one of several staging areas for multiple OGPU plots to murder exiled Soviet leader [[Leon Trotsky]], then living in [[Mexico City]]. It was American Communists who infiltrated Trotsky's killer, the [[catalonia|Catalan]] [[Ramón Mercader]], into his own household. They were also central to the NKVD's unsuccessful efforts to free the killer from a Mexican prison.    {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Soble spy ring==
Jacob Albam and the Sobles ([[Jack Soble|Jack]] and [[Myra Soble|Myra]]) were indicted on espionage charges by the FBI in 1957, all three were later convicted and served prison terms. The Zlatovskis remained in [[Paris]], [[France]], where the laws did not allow their extradition to the United States for espionage. [[Robert Soblen]] was sentenced to life in prison for his espionage work at [[Sandia National Laboratories]], but jumped bail and escaped to [[Israel]]. After being expelled from that country, he later committed [[suicide]] in [[Great Britain]] while awaiting extradition back to the United States.&lt;ref name="Haynes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooperation"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809718,00.html ''Cooperation''], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', August 19, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime espionage==
During [[World War II|the second world war]], Soviet espionage agents obtained classified reports on electronic advances in radio-beacon artillery [[Fuse (explosives)|fuses]] by [[Emerson Radio]], including a complete proximity fuse (reportedly the same fuse design that was later installed on Soviet anti-aircraft missiles to shoot down [[Francis Gary Powers]]'s [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] in 1960). {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Thousands of documents from the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) were photocopied or stolen, including a complete set of design and production drawings for [[Lockheed Aircraft]]'s new [[P-80 Shooting Star]] fighter jet.&lt;ref name="Feklisov"&gt;Feklisov, Aleksandr, and Kostin, Sergei, The Man Behind the Rosenbergs, Enigma Books (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atomic bomb secrets===
[[Joseph Stalin]] directed Soviet intelligence officers to collect information in four main areas. [[Pavel Fitin]], the 34-year-old chief of the KGB First Directorate, was directed to seek American intelligence concerning Hitler's plans for the war in Russia; secret war aims of London and Washington, particularly with regard to planning for [[Operation Overlord]], the second front in Europe; any indications the Western Allies might be willing to make a separate peace with Hitler; and American scientific and technological progress, particularly in the development of an [[atomic weapon]].

===The Silvermaster spy ring===
The [[United States Treasury]] Department was successfully penetrated by nearly a dozen Soviet agents or information sources, including [[Harold Glasser]] and his superior, [[Harry Dexter White]], assistant secretary of the treasury and the second most influential official in the department.&lt;ref name="Haynes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt;  In Late May 1941 [[Vitaly Pavlov]], a 25-year-old NKVD officer, approached White and attempted to secure his assistance to influence U.S. policy towards [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. White agreed to assist Soviet intelligence in any way he could. The principal function of White was to aid in the infiltration and placement of Soviet operatives within the government, and protecting sources. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} When security concerns arose around [[Nathan Gregory Silvermaster]], White protected him in his sensitive position at the [[Board of Economic Warfare]]. White likewise was a purveyor of information and resources to assist Soviet aims, and agreed to press for release of German occupation currency plates to the Soviet Union. The Soviets later used the plates to print unrestricted sums of money to exchange for U.S. and Allied hard goods.&lt;ref name="Schecter"&gt;Schecter, Jerrold and Leona, ''Sacred Secrets: How Soviet Intelligence Operations Changed American History'', Potomac Books (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1945 [[Elizabeth Bentley]], fearful of assassination by the Soviet MGB, turned herself in to the government. She implicated many agents and sources in the [[Jacob Golos|Golos]] and [[FBI Silvermaster File|Silvermaster]] spy networks, and was the first to accuse [[Harry Dexter White]] of acting on behalf of Soviet interests in releasing occupation plates to Moscow, later confirmed by Soviet archives and former KGB officers.&lt;ref name="Sudoplatov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schecter"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[Executive Order 9835]] of 22 March 1947 tightened protections against subversive infiltration of the US Government, defining disloyalty as membership on a list of subversive organizations maintained by the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. Truman, however, was opposed to the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] of 1950, calling it a "Mockery of the Bill of Rights" and a "long step towards totalitarianism".&lt;ref name=spartacus&gt;

'''Ta'as''', an abbreviation of the Hebrew for "Military Industry" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''Ta'asiya Tzvait''), was the clandestine arms industry of the Jewish settlement in [[Mandatory Palestine]]. In the 1930s, it was headed by [[Yisrael Amir]].&lt;ref name=milstein&gt;Milstein &amp; Sacks, 1997, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Ta'as was based on a number of small workshops and factories, the first one being hidden in a tannery ("The Aleph Institute") on the north beach of [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;Allon, 1979, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sacharov20&gt;Sacharov, 2004, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; "Aleph" had a professional staff of lathe operators, metalworkers, plane operators, milling machine operators and others.&lt;ref name=sacharov20/&gt;

[[Eliahu Sacharoff|Eliahu Sacharov]], one of the heads of the organisation,&lt;ref&gt;Mardor, 1966, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; was responsible for testing the first weapons produced by Ta'as at the [[Solel Boneh]] quarry at Migdal Tzedek.&lt;ref name=sacharov19&gt;Sacharov, 2004, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haim Slavin, an engineer from [[Russia]] who worked with [[Pinhas Rutenberg]] on building a power station at [[Naharayim]], was the general manager from 1937 to 1952.&lt;ref name=sacharov&gt;Sacharov, 2004, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Slavin's leadership Ta'as was reorganised and thereafter reached new heights of production such that it became the primary supplier of weapons to the [[Haganah]].&lt;ref name=sacharov/&gt; Slavin also developed new plants for Ta'as.&lt;ref&gt;Sacharov, 2004, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]], Ta'as developed an [[Ordnance ML 3 inch Mortar|81-mm mortar]], the Haganah's heaviest weapon at that time, and manufactured mines and grenades, 17,500 of the latter being produced for use during the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Sacharov, 2004, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, 2008, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=morris160&gt;Morris, 1999, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haganah decided to develop mortars locally in 1934, beginning with a copy of the British [[2-inch mortar]].&lt;ref name=sacharov19/&gt; This task was given to David Leibowitz, one of the founders of Ta'as, who was later to win fame as the developer of the [[Davidka]] mortar that was used extensively in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].&lt;ref name=sacharov19/&gt; Leibowitz was assisted by Yisrael Yoshpe, who became Ta'as's expert in metal casting.&lt;ref name=sacharov19/&gt;

[[File:TerraSigillataRGM.jpeg|thumb|270px|Terra sigillata beaker with [[barbotine]] decoration]]
'''Terra sigillata''' is a term with at least three distinct meanings:  as a description of medieval medicinal earth;  in archaeology, as a general term for some of the fine red [[Ancient Roman pottery]] with glossy surface [[Slip (ceramics)|slips]] made in specific areas of the Roman Empire; and more recently, as a description of a contemporary [[studio pottery]] technique supposedly inspired by ancient pottery.  Usually roughly translated as 'sealed earth', the meaning of 'terra sigillata' is 'clay bearing little images' (Latin ''sigilla''), not 'clay with a sealed (impervious) surface'.  The archaeological term is applied, however, to plain-surfaced pots as well as those decorated with figures in [[relief]].

Terra sigillata as an archaeological term refers chiefly to a specific type of plain and decorated tableware made in Italy and in Gaul (France and the Rhineland) during the Roman Empire.  These vessels have glossy surface [[Slip (ceramics)|slips]] ranging from a soft lustre to a brilliant glaze-like shine, in a characteristic colour range from pale orange to bright red; they were produced in standard shapes and sizes and were manufactured on an industrial scale and widely exported.  The sigillata industries grew up in areas where there were existing traditions of pottery manufacture, and where the clay deposits proved suitable. The products of the Italian workshops are also known as '''Aretine ware''' from [[Arezzo]] and have been collected and admired since the Renaissance.  The wares made in the [[Gaul]]ish factories are often referred to by English-speaking archaeologists as '''samian ware'''.  Closely related pottery fabrics made in the North African and Eastern provinces of the Roman Empire are not usually referred to as terra sigillata, but by more specific names, e.g. [[African red slip ware]]s.  All these types of pottery are significant for archaeologists:  they can often be closely dated, and their distribution casts light on aspects of the ancient Roman economy.

Modern "Terra sig" should be clearly distinguished from the close reproductions of Roman wares made by some potters deliberately recreating and using the Roman methods.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, http://archeologie.pagesperso-orange.fr/experimental/morla.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The finish called 'terra sigillata' by studio potters can be made from most [[clay]], mixed as a very thin liquid slip and settled to separate out only the finest particles to be used as terra sigillata. When applied to unfired clay surfaces, "terra sig" can be polished with a soft cloth or brush to achieve a shine ranging from a smooth silky lustre to a high gloss. The surface of ancient terra sigillata vessels did not require this [[burnishing (pottery)|burnishing]] or polishing. Burnishing was a technique used on some wares in the Roman period, but terra sigillata was not one of them.  The polished surface can only be retained if fired within the low-fire range and will lose its shine if fired higher, but can still display an appealing silky quality.

==Medicinal earth==
The oldest use for the term terra sigillata was for a [[medicinal clay]] from the island of [[Lemnos]].  The latter was called "sealed" because cakes of it were pressed together and stamped with the head of [[Artemis]]. Later, it bore the seal of the [[Ottoman sultan]].  This soil's particular mineralic content was such that, in the [[Renaissance]], it was seen as a proof against poisoning, as well as a general cure for any bodily impurities, and it was highly prized as a medicine and medicinal component.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1580, a miner named Adreas Berthold traveled around Germany selling Silesian terra sigillata made from a special clay dug from the hills outside the town of Striga, now [[Strzegom]], Poland, and processed into small tablets. He promoted it as a panacea effective against every type of poison and several diseases, including plague. Berthold invited authorities to test it themselves. In two cases, physicians, princes and town leaders conducted trials involving dogs who were either given poison followed by the antidote or poison alone; the dogs who got the antidote lived and the dogs who got the poison alone died. In 1581, a prince tested the antidote on a condemned criminal, who survived.&lt;ref name="NEJM"&gt;{{cite journal

In 1588 English ethnographer and translator [[Thomas Harriot]] wrote in ''A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia'' that [[Algonquians]] of the mid–Atlantic region treated various sores and wounds with ''wapeih'', a kind of terra sigillata that English surgeons and physicians found to be of the same kind "of vertue and more effectuall" than the contemporary European sort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&amp;context=etas A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia], Thomas Hariot, 1588.

[[File:201005151401 NE CSM Aretinische TS.jpg|thumb|260px|left|A decorated Arretine vase (Form Dragendorff 11) found at Neuss, Germany]]
In archaeological usage, the term ''terra sigillata'' without further qualification normally denotes the Arretine ware of Italy, made at [[Arezzo]], and Gaulish samian ware manufactured first in South [[Gaul]], particularly at [[La Graufesenque]], near [[Millau]], and later at [[Lezoux]] and adjacent sites near [[Clermont-Ferrand]], and at east Gaulish sites such as [[Trier]], Sinzig and [[Rheinzabern]].  These high-quality tablewares were particularly popular and widespread in the Western Roman Empire from about 50 BC to the early 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;King 1983, p.253 (definition) and pp. 183–186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Roberts, 'Mass-production of Roman Finewares', in Ian Freestone &amp; David Gaimster, ''Pottery in the Making: World Ceramic Traditions'', London 1997, pp. 188–193&lt;/ref&gt;  Definitions of 'TS' have grown up from the earliest days of antiquarian studies, and are far from consistent; one survey of Classical art says: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Terra sigillata'' ... is a Latin term used by modern scholars to designate a class of decorated red-gloss pottery .... not all red-gloss ware was decorated, and hence the more inclusive term 'Samian ware' is sometimes used to characterize all varieties of it.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, pp. 276-77&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

- whereas Anthony King's definition, following the more usual practice among Roman pottery specialists, makes no mention of decoration, but states that terra sigillata is 'alternatively known as samian ware'.  However, 'samian ware' is normally used only to refer to the sub-class of terra sigillata made in ancient Gaul. In European languages other than English, terra sigillata, or a translation (e.g. ''terre sigillée''), is always used for both Italian and Gaulish products.&lt;ref&gt;King 1983, p.253. See also the [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/r/roman_pottery_terra_sigillata.aspx British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The meaning and etymology of 'samian ware' is a somewhat complex matter, fully addressed in King 1980.  There is ancient authority for the use of  ''samia vasa'' to describe pottery with a polished surface in literary usage (Pliny, ''Nat. Hist.'' 35, 160), and the verb ''samiare'', 'to polish' is probably connected.  However, it would be unwise to exclude all possible historical associations with the island of [[Samos]], though of course the pottery known as samian ware to present-day archaeologists has nothing to do with that region.  The modern parallel of the English term 'china' may be an apt one:  'china' refers to a class of ceramic that no longer has any direct connection with the country, China, but it was originally developed as part of the European attempts to imitate imported [[Chinese porcelain]] in the 18th century.  The parallel with 'china' is the reason why the late Professor Eric Birley favoured the use of a lower-case initial for 'samian'. (Birley ''pers.comm'', 1960s, and see also Stanfield and Simpson 1958, p.xxxi, footnote 1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nomenclature has to be established at an early stage of research into a subject, and antiquarians of the 18th and 19th centuries often used terms that we would not choose today, but as long as their meaning is clear and well-established, this does not matter, and detailed study of the history of the terminology is really a side-issue that is of academic interest only.  Scholars writing in English now often use "red gloss wares" or "red slip wares", both to avoid these issues of definition,&lt;ref&gt;As both King and Boardman do in their main texts.&lt;/ref&gt;  and also because many other wares of the Roman period share aspects of technique with the traditional sigillata fabrics.
[[File:Roman pottery samian form Dr 29 edit.jpg|thumb|Profile drawing of form Dragendorff 29. 1st century AD.]]

Italian and Gaulish TS vessels were made in standardised shapes constituting services of matching dishes, bowls and serving vessels.  These changed and evolved over time, and have been very minutely classified; the first major scheme, by the German classical archaeologist [[Hans Dragendorff]] (1895), is still in use (as e.g. "Dr.29"),&lt;ref&gt;H. Dragendorff, 'Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der griechischen und römischen Keramik', ''Bonner Jahrbücher'' 96 (1895).&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been many others, such as the classifications of Déchelette, Knorr, Hermet, Walters, Curle, Loeschcke, Ritterling, Hermet and Ludowici, and more recently, the ''Conspectus'' of Arretine forms and Hayes's type-series of African Red Slip and Eastern sigillatas.&lt;ref&gt;Oswald &amp; Pryce 1920 covers the main typologies of the early 20th century. Ettlinger 1990 is the current reference system for Arretine, and Hayes 1972 and 1980 for the late Roman material.&lt;/ref&gt;  These reference sometimes make it possible to date the manufacture of a broken decorated sherd to within 20 years or less.

Most of the forms that were decorated with figures in low relief were thrown in pottery moulds, the inner surfaces of which had been decorated using fired-clay stamps or punches (usually referred to as ''poinçons'') and some free-hand work using a [[stylus]].  The mould was therefore decorated on its interior surface with a full decorative design of impressed, intaglio (hollowed) motifs that would appear in low relief on any bowl formed in it.  As the bowl dried, the shrinkage was sufficient for it to be withdrawn from the mould, in order to carry out any finishing work, which might include the addition of foot-rings, the shaping and finishing of rims, and in all cases the application of the slip.  [[Barbotine]] and [[appliqué]] ('sprigged') techniques were sometimes used to decorate vessels of closed forms.&lt;ref&gt;Closed forms: shapes such as vases and flagons/jugs that cannot be made in a single mould because they have a swelling profile that tapers inwards from the point of greatest diameter. Some large [[flagon]]s were made at La Graufesenque by making the lower and upper bowl-shaped portions in moulds, and then joining these and adding the neck.  Obviously the open forms, namely bowls that could be formed in, and extracted from, a single mould, were quicker and simpler to make.&lt;/ref&gt;   Study of the characteristic decorative [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]s, combined in some cases with name-stamps of workshops incorporated into the decoration, and also sometimes with the [[cursive]] signatures of mouldmakers, makes it possible to build up a very detailed knowledge of the industry.  Careful observation of form and fabric is therefore usually enough for an archaeologist experienced in the study of sigillata to date and identify a broken [[sherd]]:  a potter's stamp or moulded decoration provides even more precise evidence. The classic guide by Oswald and Pryce, published in 1920 &lt;ref&gt;Felix Oswald &amp; T.D. Pryce, ''An Introduction to the study of terra sigillata'', London 1920&lt;/ref&gt; set out many of the principles, but the literature on the subject goes back into the 19th century, and is now extremely voluminous, including many monographs on specific regions, as well as excavation reports on important sites that have produced significant assemblages of sigillata wares, and articles in learned journals, some of which are dedicated to Roman pottery studies.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Knorr 1919; Knorr 1952; Hermet 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The site reports on the German forts at [[Haltern]] and [[Hofheim, Hesse|Hofheim]] in the early 20th century included form-classifications which are still in use for forms that were absent from Dragendorff's original list: Loeschcke 1909; Ritterling 1913&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:La Graufesenque samian kiln.jpg|thumb|270px|left|The remains of the ''grand four'' ("big [[kiln]]") at La Graufesenque]]

The motifs and designs on the [[relief]]-decorated wares echo the general traditions of Graeco-Roman decorative arts, with depictions of deities, references to myths and legends, and popular themes such as hunting and erotic scenes.  Individual figure-types, like the vessel-shapes, have been classified, and in many cases they may be linked with specific potters or workshops.  Some of the decoration relates to contemporary architectural ornament, with [[egg-and-tongue]] (ovolo) mouldings, [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] and vine [[scrollwork|scrolls]] and the like.  While the decoration of Arretine ware is often highly naturalistic in style, and is closely comparable with silver tableware of the same period, the designs on the Gaulish products, made by provincial artisans adopting Classical subjects, are intriguing for their expression of '[[Romanization (cultural)|romanisation]]', the fusion of Classical and native cultural and artistic traditions.

Many of the Gaulish manufacturing sites have been extensively excavated and studied.  At [[La Graufesenque]] in southern Gaul, documentary evidence in the form of lists or tallies apparently fired with single kiln-loads, giving potters' names and numbers of pots have long been known, and they suggest very large loads of 25,000–30,000 vessels.  Though not all the kilns at this, or other, manufacturing sites were so large, the excavation of the ''grand four'' (big kiln) at La Graufesenque, which was in use in the late 1st and early 2nd century, confirms the scale of the industry.  It is a rectangular stone-built structure measuring 11.3 m. by 6.8 m. externally, with an original height estimated at 7 metres. With up to nine 'storeys' within (dismantled after each firing), formed of tile floors and vertical columns in the form of clay pipes or tubes, which also served to conduct the heat, it has been estimated that it was capable of firing 30,000–40,000 vessels at a time, at a temperature of around 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Webster 1996, pp. 9–12 provides a useful summary.  For a report on the ''grand four'', see Vernhet 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 work has shown that the slip is a matrix of mainly silicon and aluminium oxides, within which are suspended sub-microscopic crystals of haematite and corundum. The matrix itself does not contain any metallic ions, the haematite is substituted in aluminium and titanium while the corundum is substituted in iron. The two crystal populations are homogenously dispersed within the matrix.  The colour of haematite depends on the crystal size. Large crystals of this mineral are black but as the size decreases to sub-micron the colour shifts to red. The fraction of aluminium has a similar effect. It was formerly thought that the difference between 'red' and 'black' samian was due to the presence (black) or absence (red) of reducing gases from the kiln and that the construction of the kiln was so arranged as to prevent the reducing gases from the fuel from coming into contact with the pottery. The presence of iron oxides in the clay/slip was thought to be reflected in the colour according to the oxidation state of the iron (Fe[III] for the red and Fe[II] for the black, the latter produced by the reducing gases coming into contact with the pottery during firing). It now appears as a result of this recent work that this is not the case and that the colour of the glossy slip is in fact due to no more than the crystal size of the minerals dispersed within the matrix glass.&lt;ref&gt;Sciau, P. et al 2005, pp.006.5.1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forerunners===

Arretine ware, in spite of its very distinctive appearance, was an integral part of the wider picture of fine ceramic tablewares in the Graeco-Roman world of the [[Hellenistic]] and early Roman period.  That picture must itself be seen in relation to the luxury tablewares made of silver.  Centuries before Italian  terra sigillata was made, [[Black-figure pottery|Attic painted vases]], and later their regional variants made in Italy, involved the preparation of a very fine clay body covered with a slip that fired to a glossy surface without the need for any polishing or burnishing.  Greek painted wares also involved the precise understanding and control of firing conditions to achieve the contrasts of black and red.&lt;ref&gt;Noble 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Megarian bowl.JPG#Summary|thumb|230px|A black Megarian bowl, 2nd century BC]]
Glossy-slipped black pottery made in [[Etruria]] and [[Campania]] continued this technological tradition, though painted decoration gave way to simpler stamped motifs and in some cases, to applied motifs moulded in relief.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes 1997, pp. 37-40&lt;/ref&gt;  The tradition of decorating entire vessels in low relief was also well established in Greece and Asia Minor by the time the Arretine industry began to expand in the middle of the 1st century BC, and examples were imported into Italy.  Relief-decorated cups, some in lead-glazed wares, were produced at several eastern centres, and undoubtedly played a part in the technical and stylistic evolution of decorated Arretine, but Megarian bowls, made chiefly in Greece and Asia Minor, are usually seen as the most direct inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Garbsch 1982, pp.30-33&lt;/ref&gt;  These are small, hemispherical bowls without foot-rings, and their decoration is frequently very reminiscent of contemporary silver bowls, with formalised, radiating patterns of leaves and flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes 1997, pp.40-41:  Garbsch 1982, pp. 26-30&lt;/ref&gt;  The crisp and precisely profiled forms of the plain dishes and cups were also part of a natural evolution of taste and fashion in the Mediterranean world of the 1st century BC.

===Arretine ware===
[[File:Arretine ware poinçon.JPG|thumb|190px|left|An Arretine stamp used for impressing a mould]]

Arretine ware began to be manufactured at and near [[Arezzo]] (Tuscany) a little before the middle of the 1st century BC.  The industry expanded rapidly in a period when Roman political and military influence was spreading far beyond Italy:  for the inhabitants of the first provinces of the Roman Empire in the reign of the Emperor Augustus (''reg.'' 27 BC&amp;nbsp;– AD 14), this tableware, with its precise forms, shiny surface, and, on the decorated vessels, its visual introduction to Classical art and mythology, must have deeply impressed some inhabitants of the new northern provinces of the Empire.  Certainly it epitomised certain aspects of Roman taste and technical expertise.   Pottery industries in the areas we now call north-east France and [[Belgium]] quickly began to copy the shapes of plain Arretine dishes and cups in the wares now known as Gallo-Belgic,&lt;ref&gt;Tyers 1996, pp.161–166&lt;/ref&gt; and in South and Central Gaul, it was not long before local potters also began to emulate the mould-made decoration and the glossy red slip itself.

The most recognisable decorated Arretine form is Dragendorff 11, a large, deep goblet on a high pedestal base, closely resembling some silver table vessels of the same period, such as the [[Warren Cup]].  The [[iconography]], too, tended to match the subjects and styles seen on silver plate, namely mythological and genre scenes, including erotic subjects, and small decorative details of swags, leafy wreaths and ovolo ([[egg-and-tongue]]) borders that may be compared with elements of Augustan architectural ornament. The deep form of the Dr.11 allowed the ''poinçons'' (stamps) used making the moulds of human and animal figures to be fairly large, often about 5–6&amp;nbsp;cm high, and the modelling is frequently very accomplished indeed, attracting the interest of modern art-historians as well as archaeologists.  Major workshops, such as those of M.Perennius Tigranus, P. Cornelius and Cn. Ateius, stamped their products, and the names of the factory-owners and of the workers within the factories, which often appear on completed bowls and on plain wares, have been extensively studied, as have the forms of the vessels, and the details of their dating and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Oxé-Comfort 1968 / 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arretine mould.JPG|thumb|230px|Mould for an Arretine Dr.11, manufactured in the workshop of P. Cornelius]]

Italian sigillata was not made only at or near Arezzo itself:  some of the important Arezzo businesses had branch factories in [[Pisa]], and by the beginning of the 1st century AD, the Ateius and Rasinius workshops had set up branch factories at La Muette, near [[Lyon]] in Central Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1996, pp.191–2&lt;/ref&gt;  Nor were the classic Arretine wares of the Augustan period the only forms of terra sigillata made in Italy:  later sigillata industries in the [[Po Valley]] and elsewhere continued the tradition.  The history of sigillata manufacture in Italy is succinctly summarised in Hayes 1997, pages 41–52.

In the Middle Ages, examples of the ware that were serendipitously discovered in digging foundations in Arezzo drew admiring attention as early as the 13th century, when [[Restoro d'Arezzo]]'s massive encyclopedia included a chapter praising the refined Roman ware discovered in his native city, "what is perhaps the first account of an aspect of ancient art to be written since classical times".&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Weiss, ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford: Blackwell) 1973:13 and note.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicler [[Giovanni Villani]] also mentioned the ware.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss 1973:13 note 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published study of Arretine ware was that of Fabroni in 1841,&lt;ref&gt;Fabroni 1841&lt;/ref&gt; and by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, German scholars in particular had made great advances in systematically studying and understanding both Arretine ware and the Gaulish samian that occurred on Roman military sites being excavated in Germany.  Dragendorff's classification was expanded by other scholars, including S. Loeschcke in his study of the Italian sigillata excavated at the early Roman site of [[Haltern]].&lt;ref&gt;Loeschcke 1909&lt;/ref&gt;  Research on Arretine ware has continued very actively throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, for example with the publication and revision of Oxé-Comfort and the ''Conspectus'' of forms, bringing earlier work on stamps and shapes up to date.&lt;ref&gt;Oxé-Comfort 1968/2000; Ettlinger 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  As with all ancient pottery studies, each generation asks new questions and applies new techniques (such as analysis of clays) in the attempt to find the answers.

===South Gaulish samian ware===
[[File:South Gaulish samian Dr 29 2.JPG|thumb|270px|left|South Gaulish Dragendorff 29, late 1st century AD]]
Sigillata vessels, both plain and decorated, were manufactured at several centres in southern France, including [[Bram, Aude|Bram]], [[Montans]], La Graufesenque, [[Le Rozier]] and [[Banassac]],&lt;ref&gt;see Tyers 1996, p. 106,  fig.90 for a map of the Gaulish production sites&lt;/ref&gt; from the late 1st century BC:  of these, La Graufesenque, near Millau, was the principal producer and exporter.  Although the establishment of sigillata potteries in Gaul may well have arisen initially to meet local demand and to undercut the prices of imported Italian goods, they became enormously successful in their own right, and by the later 1st century AD, South Gaulish samian was being exported not only to other provinces in the north-west of the Empire, but also to Italy and other regions of the Mediterranean, North Africa and even the eastern Empire.  One of the finds in the ruins of [[Pompeii]], destroyed by the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in August AD 79, was a consignment of South Gaulish sigillata, still in its packing crate;&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, D., 'A hoard of samian ware from Pompeii', ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 4 (1914), pp. 26–64&lt;/ref&gt; like all finds from the Vesuvian sites, this hoard of pottery is invaluable as dating evidence.
[[File:Roman pottery South Gaulish samian ware.jpg|thumb|250px|South Gaulish plain forms, showing standardisation of size]]
South Gaulish samian typically has a redder slip and deeper pink fabric than Italian sigillata.  The best slips, vivid red and of an almost mirror-like brilliance, were achieved during the [[Emperor Claudius|Claudian]] and early [[Nero]]nian periods (Claudius, ''reg''. AD 41–54;  Nero, ''reg''. AD 54–68).  At the same period, some workshops experimented briefly with a marbled red-and-yellow slip, a variant that never became generally popular.&lt;ref&gt;Johns 1977, p. 12, Pl.II&lt;/ref&gt;  Early production of plain forms in South Gaul initially followed the Italian models closely, and even the characteristic Arretine decorated form, Dragendorff 11, was made.  But many new shapes quickly evolved, and by the second half of the 1st century AD, when Italian sigillata was no longer influential, South Gaulish samian had created its own characteristic repertoire of forms. The two principal decorated forms were Dragendorff 30, a deep, cylindrical bowl, and Dragendorff 29, a carinated ('keeled') shallow bowl with a marked angle, emphasised by a moulding, mid-way down the profile.  The footring is low, and potters' stamps are usually bowl-maker's marks placed in the interior base, so that vessels made from the same, or parallel, moulds may bear different names.  The rim of the 29, small and upright in early examples of the form, but much deeper and more everted by the 70s of the 1st century, is finished with rouletted decoration,&lt;ref&gt;'Rouletted' decoration: this is a regular, notched surface texture, created by using a tool with a toothed wheel (''roulette'') to impress the pattern on the bowl before the clay was hard.  It is also possible that it was sometimes made by holding a blade-like tool against the vessel as it turned on the wheel, allowing the tool to judder against the surface of the clay.&lt;/ref&gt; and the relief-decorated surfaces necessarily fall into two narrow zones.  These were usually decorated with floral and foliate designs of wreaths and scrolls at first: the Dr.29 resting on its rim illustrated in the lead section of this article is an early example, less angular than the developed form of the 60s and 70s, with decoration consisting of simple, very elegant leaf-scrolls.  Small human and animal figures, and more complex designs set out in separate panels, became more popular by the 70s of the 1st century.  Larger human and animal figures could be used on the Dr.30 vessels, but while many of these have great charm, South Gaulish craftsmen never achieved, and perhaps never aspired to, the Classical naturalism of some of their Italian counterparts.
[[File:Samian ware bowl by Mercato.JPG|thumb|220px|South Gaulish bowl, Dr.37, from the late 1st century AD, with a stamp of the potter Mercato in the decoration]]
In the last two decades of the 1st century, the Dragendorff 37, a deep, rounded vessel with a plain upright rim, overtook the 29 in popularity.  This simple shape remained the standard Gaulish samian relief-decorated form, from all Gaulish manufacturing regions, for more than a century.  Small relief-decorated [[Beaker (archaeology)|beakers]] such as forms Déchelette 67 and Knorr 78 were also made in South Gaul, as were occasional 'one-off' or very ambitious mould-made vessels, such as large thin-walled flagons and flasks.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of these may be found in Hermet's own type-sequence, Hermet 1934, Pl.4—5&lt;/ref&gt;  But the mass of South Gaulish samian found on Roman sites of the 1st century AD consists of plain dishes, bowls and cups, especially Dr.18 (a shallow dish) and Dr.27 (a little cup with a distinctive double curve to the profile), many of which bear potters' name-stamps, and the large decorated forms 29, 30 and 37.

A local industry inspired by Arretine and South Gaulish imports grew up in the [[Iberia]]n provinces in the 1st century AD. ''Terra sigillata hispanica'' developed its own distinctive forms and designs, and continued in production into the late Roman period, the 4th and 5th centuries AD.  It was not exported to other regions.

===Central Gaulish samian ware===
[[File:Central Gaulish samian Dr.30.JPG|thumb|230px|left|Central Gaulish Dr.30, stamped by Divixtus]]
The principal Central Gaulish samian potteries were situated at Lezoux and [[Les Martres-de-Veyre]], not far from [[Clermont-Ferrand]] in the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]].   Production had already begun at Lezoux in the [[Emperor Augustus|Augustan]] period (Augustus, ''reg''. 27 BC–AD 14), but it was not until the reign of [[Trajan]] (AD 98–117), and the beginning of a decline in the South Gaulish export trade, that Central Gaulish samian ware became important outside its own region.  Though it never achieved the extensive geographical distribution of the South Gaulish factories, in the provinces of Gaul and [[Roman Britain|Britain]], it was by far the most common type of fine tableware, plain and decorated, in use during the 2nd century AD.  The quality of the ware and the slip is usually excellent, and some of the products of Les Martres-de-Veyre, in particular, are outstanding, with a lustrous slip and a very hard, dense body.&lt;ref&gt;Johns 1977, p. 24:  Tyers 1996, 113&lt;/ref&gt;  The surface colour tends towards a more orange-red hue than the typical South Gaulish slips.

Vessel-forms that had been made in South Gaul continued to be produced, though as the decades passed, they evolved and changed with the normal shifts of fashion, and some new shapes were created, such as the plain bowl with a horizontal flange below the rim, Dr.38.  [[Mortarium|Mortaria]], food-preparation bowls with a gritted interior surface, were also made in Central Gaulish samian fabric in the second half of the 2nd century (Dr.45).  There is a small sub-class of Central Gaulish samian ware with a glossy black slip, though the dividing line between black terra sigillata and other fine black-gloss wares, which were also manufactured in the area, is sometimes hazy.  When a vessel is a classic samian form and decorated in relief in the style of a known samian potter, but finished with black slip rather than a red one, it may be classed as black samian.
[[File:Roman pottery Central Gaulish samian jar.JPG|thumb|230px|Central Gaulish samian jar with 'cut-glass' decoration]]

Though the Central Gaulish forms continued and built upon the South Gaulish traditions, the decoration of the principal decorated forms, Dr.30 and Dr.37, was distinctive.&lt;ref&gt;The basic study remains Stanfield &amp; [[Grace Simpson|Simpson]] 1958 / 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  New human and animal figure-types appeared, generally modelled with greater realism and sophistication than those of La Graufesenque and other South Gaulish centres.  Figure-types and decorative details have been classified, and can often be linked to specific workshops&lt;ref&gt;Many of the Central Gaulish types were first drawn and classified in Déchelette 1904.  Oswald's classification (Oswald 1936–7) is much fuller, covering South, Central and East Gaulish types, but is marred by the poor quality of the drawings.&lt;/ref&gt; Lezoux wares also included vases decorated with [[barbotine]] relief, with appliqué motifs, and a class usually referred to as 'cut-glass' decoration, with geometric patterns cut into the surface of the vessel before slipping and firing.  Two standard 'plain' types made in considerable numbers in Central Gaul also included barbotine decoration, Dr.35 and 36, a matching cup and dish with a curved horizontal rim embellished with a stylised scroll of leaves in relief.

During the second half of the 2nd century, some Lezoux workshops making relief-decorated bowls, above all that of Cinnamus, dominated the market with their large production.&lt;ref&gt;Stanfield &amp; Simpson 1958, pp. 263–271&lt;/ref&gt;  The wares of Cinnamus, Paternus, Divixtus, Doeccus, Advocisus, Albucius and some others often included large, easily legible name-stamps incorporated into the decoration, clearly acting as brand-names or advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;Johns 1977,pp.16–17&lt;/ref&gt;  Though these vessels were very competently made, they are heavy and somewhat coarse in form and finish compared with earlier Gaulish samian ware.

From the end of the 2nd century, the export of sigillata from Central Gaul rapidly, perhaps even abruptly, ceased.  Pottery production continued, but in the 3rd century, it reverted to being a local industry.

===East Gaulish samian ware===
[[File:Rheinzabern samian vase.JPG|thumb|190px|left|Rheinzabern barbotine-decorated vase, form Ludowici VMe]]
There were numerous potteries manufacturing terra sigillata in East Gaul, which included [[Alsace]], the [[Saarland]], and the [[Rhine]] and [[Moselle (river)|Mosel]] regions, but while the samian pottery from [[Luxeuil]], [[Laneuveville-devant-Nancy|La Madeleine]], Chémery-Faulquemont, [[Lavoye]], [[Remagen]], [[Sinzig]], Blickweiler and other sites is of interest and importance mainly to specialists, two sources stand out because their wares are often found outside their own immediate areas, namely [[Rheinzabern]], near [[Speyer]], and [[Trier]].&lt;ref&gt;For a good selection of examples, see Garbsch 1982, pp. 54–74&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trier potteries evidently began to make samian vessels around the beginning of the 2nd century AD, and were still active until the middle of the 3rd century.  The styles and the potters have been divided by scholars into two main phases, Werkstatten I and II.&lt;ref&gt;Huld-Zetsche 1972;  Huld-Zetsche 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the later mould-made Dr.37 bowls are of very poor quality, with crude decoration and careless finishing.

The Rheinzabern kilns and their products have been studied since Wilhelm Ludowici (1855–1929) began to excavate there in 1901, and to publish his results in a series of detailed reports.&lt;ref&gt;Ludowici 1927; Ricken 1942; Ricken &amp; Fischer 1963&lt;/ref&gt;  Rheinzabern produced both decorated and plain forms for around a century from the middle of the 2nd century.  Some of the Dr.37 bowls, for example those with the workshop stamp of Ianus, bear comparison with Central Gaulish products of the same date:  others are less successful. But the real strength of the Rheinzabern industry lay in its extensive production of good-quality samian cups, beakers, flagons and vases, many imaginatively decorated with barbotine designs or in the 'cut-glass' incised technique.  Ludowici created his own type-series, which sometimes overlaps with those of other sigillata specialists.  Ludowici's types use combinations of upper- and lower-case letters rather than simple numbers, the first letter referring to the general shape, such as 'T' for ''Teller'' (dish).

In general, the products of the East Gaulish industries moved away from the early imperial Mediterranean tradition of intricately profiled dishes and cups, and ornamented bowls made in moulds, and converged with the later Roman local traditions of pottery-making in the northern provinces, using free-thrown, rounded forms and creating relief designs with freehand slip-trailing.  Fashions in fine tablewares were changing.  Some East Gaulish producers made bowls and cups decorated only with rouletted or stamped decoration, and in the 3rd and 4th centuries, [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne]] ware, decorated with all-over patterns of small stamps, was made in the area east of Rheims and quite widely traded.&lt;ref&gt;Tyers 1996, pp. 136–7.  The stamps have been classified in Chenet 1941 and Hübener 1968&lt;/ref&gt;   Argonne ware was essentially still a type of sigillata, and the most characteristic form is a small, sturdy Dr.37 bowl.  Small, localised attempts to make conventional relief-decorated samian ware included a brief and unsuccessful venture at [[Colchester]] in Britain, apparently initiated by potters from the East Gaulish factories at Sinzig, a centre that was itself an offshoot of the Trier workshops.&lt;ref&gt;Tyers 1996. pp. 114–116; Hull 1963; Fischer 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern sigillatas===
In the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire, there had been several industries making fine red tablewares with smooth, glossy-slipped surfaces since about the middle of the 2nd century BC, well before the rise of the Italian sigillata workshops.  By the 1st century BC, their forms often paralleled Arretine plain-ware shapes quite closely.  There were evidently centres of production in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]; in western Turkey, exported through [[Ephesos]]; [[Pergamon]]; [[Çandarlı]], near Pergamon; and on [[Cyprus]], but archaeologists often refer to [[eastern sigillata A]] from Northern [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], [[eastern sigillata B]] from [[Tralles]] in Asia Minor, [[eastern sigillata C]] from ancient [[Pitane (Aeolis)|Pitane]], and [[eastern sigillata D]] (or Cypriot sigillata) from Cyprus, as there is still much to be learnt about this material.  While eastern sigillata C is known to come from Çandarli (ancient [[Pitane (Aeolis)|Pitane]]), there were likely other workshops in the wider region of [[Pergamon]].&lt;ref&gt;The summary in Hayes 1997, pages 52–59 illustrates the main forms and describes the characteristics of wares.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 2nd century AD, when Gaulish samian was completely dominating the markets in the Northern provinces, the eastern sigillatas were themselves beginning to be displaced by the rising importance of African Red Slip wares in the Mediterranean and the Eastern Empire. In the fourth century AD, [[Phocaean red slip]] appears as a successor to Eastern sigillata C.

In the 1980s two primary groups of Eastern Terra Sigillata in the Eastern Mediterranean basin were distinguished as ETS-I and ETS-II based on their chemical fingerprints as shown by analysis by instrumental [[neutron activation analysis]] (INAA).  ETS-I originated in Eastern [[Cyprus]], whereas the ETS-II was probably made in [[Pamphylia]], at [[Perge]], [[Aspendos]] and [[Side, Turkey|Side]]. &lt;!-- "Also the chronology of Eastern Terra Sigillata has changed in the light of the origin of the ETS pottery, i.e. 150 BC – 70 AD (the destruction of Eastern Cyprus and the Temple of Jerusalem." Too incoherent to use – please clarify. what about these dates? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

A potter's quarter at [[Sagalassos]] inland from the southern Turkish coast has been excavated since it was discovered in 1987, and its wares traced to many sites in the region. It was active from around 25 to 550 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Poblome, Jernen, "The Ecology of Sagalassos (Southwest Turkey) Red Slip Ware", in ''Archaeological and historical aspects of West-European societies: album amicorum André Van Doorselaer'', Issue 8 of ''Acta archaeologica Lovaniensia: Monographiae'', 1996, Ed.

===African red slip ware===
{{main|African red slip ware}}
[[File:Roman pottery African Red Slip.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Late Roman African Red Slip dish, 4th century AD]]
African red slip ware (ARS) was the final development of terra sigillata.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes 1972 and Hayes 1980 are the standard reference works:  Hayes 1997, pp. 59–64 provides a succinct summary.&lt;/ref&gt;   While the products of the Italian and Gaulish red-gloss industries flourished and were exported from their places of manufacture for at most a century or two each, ARS production continued for more than 500 years.  The centres of production were in the Roman provinces of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsularis]], [[Byzacena]] and [[Numidia]]; that is, modern [[Tunisia]] and part of eastern [[Algeria]].  From about the 4th century AD, competent copies of the fabric and forms were also made in several other regions, including [[Asia Minor]], the eastern Mediterranean and Egypt.   Over the long period of production, there was obviously much change and evolution in both forms and fabrics.  Both Italian and Gaulish plain forms influenced ARS in the 1st and 2nd centuries (for example, Hayes Form 2, the cup or dish with an outcurved rim decorated with barbotine leaves, is a direct copy of the samian forms Dr.35 and 36, made in South and Central Gaul),&lt;ref&gt;Hayes 1972, p. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; but over time a distinctive ARS repertoire developed.
[[File:African Red Slip vessels.JPG|thumb|220px|African Red Slip flagons and vases, 2nd-4th century AD]]
There was a wide range of dishes and bowls, many with rouletted or stamped decoration, and closed forms such as tall ovoid flagons with appliqué ornament (Hayes Form 171).  The ambitious large rectangular dishes with relief decoration in the centre and on the wide rims (Hayes Form 56),  were clearly inspired by decorated silver platters of the 4th century, which were made in rectangular and polygonal shapes as well as in the traditional circular form.  Decorative motifs reflected not only the Graeco-Roman traditions of the Mediterranean, but eventually the rise of [[Christianity]] as well. There is a great variety of monogram crosses and plain crosses amongst the stamps.

==Modern pottery==
In contrast to the archaeological usage, in which the term ''terra sigillata'' refers to a whole class of pottery, in contemporary [[ceramic art]], 'terra sigillata' describes only a  watery refined slip used to facilitate the [[Burnishing (pottery)|burnish]]ing of raw clay surfaces to promote glossy surface effects in low fire techniques, including [[Pit fired pottery|primitive]] and unglazed alternative western-style [[Raku ware|Raku]] firing. Terra sigillata is also used as a brushable decorative colourant medium in higher temperature [[Ceramic glaze|glazed]] ceramic techniques.

In 1906 the German potter '''Karl Fischer''' re-invented the method of making terra sigillata of Roman quality and obtained patent protection for this procedure at the ''[[Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt|Kaiserliche Patentamt]]'' in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Patent No. 206 395, Class 80b, Group 23; according to: Heinl, Rudolf; ''Die Kunsttöpferfamilie Fischer aus Sulzbach'', Sulzbach-Rosenberg 1984; Patents in the UK, France and the USA are reported in the source, yet without patent-number&lt;/ref&gt;

===Making modern terra sigillata===
Modern terra sigillata is made by allowing the [[clay]] particles to separate into layers by particle size. A [[deflocculant]] such as [[sodium silicate]] is often added to the watery clay/water slip mixture to facilitate separation of fine particle [[flocculation|flocs]] or aggregates. For undisturbed deflocculated slip settling in a transparent container, these layers are usually visible within 24 hours. Siphoning off the topmost layers of slip, which contain the smallest clay particles, produces terra sigillata. The remaining larger clay-particle layers are discarded.

Terra sigillata is usually brushed or sprayed in thin layers onto dry or almost dry unfired ware. The ware is then burnished with a soft cloth before the water in the terra sigillata soaks into the porous body or with a hard, smooth-surfaced object . The burnished ware is fired, often to a lower temperature than normal bisque temperature of approximately 900&amp;nbsp;°C. Higher firing temperatures tend to remove the burnished effect because the clay particles start to recrystalize.

===Reuse of Roman pottery===
Since the 18th century Samian ware pots have been found in sufficient numbers in the sea near [[Whitstable]] and [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] that local people used them for cooking.&lt;ref name=Canterbury&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canterbury.co.uk/museums/roman-museum/Roman-pottery.aspx |title=Roman pottery |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Visit Canterbury |publisher=canterbury city council |access-date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rummel&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/archaeology/research/materials/samian/wks-three.aspx |title=Workshop Three: Research Partnerships |last1=Christoph |first1=Rummel|publisher= The University of Nottingham Department of Archaeology |access-date=15 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "'''Think globally, act locally'''" or "'''Think global, act local'''" has been used in various contexts, including planning, environment, education, mathematics, and business.

==Definition==
'''"Think globally, act locally"''' urges people to consider the health of the entire planet and to take action in their own communities and cities. Long before governments began enforcing environmental laws, individuals were coming together to protect habitats and the organisms that live within them. These efforts are referred to as grassroots efforts. They occur on a local level and are primarily run by volunteers and helpers.

"Think Globally, Act Locally" originally began at the grassroots level, however, it is now a global concept with high importance. It is not just volunteers who take the environment into consideration. It is corporations, government officials, education system, and local communities.

Warren Heaps states, "It's really important to recognize that markets are different around the world, and company compensation programs should reflect a balance between global corporate philosophy and local practice and culture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalhrforum.com/2010/02/28/%E2%80%9Cthink-globally-act-locally%E2%80%9D-for-compensation-design "Think Globally, Act Locally for Compensation Design". Warren Heaps. 28 February 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin in town planning==
The original phrase "Think global, act local" has been attributed to Scots town planner and social activist [[Patrick Geddes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Barash
  | first = David
  | title = Peace and Conflict
  | publisher=[[Sage Publications]]
  | page= 547
  | year = 2002
  | ISBN = 978-0-7619-2507-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the exact phrase does not appear in Geddes' 1915 book "Cities in Evolution,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Geddes|first=Patrick|title=Cities in Evolution|publisher=Williams|location=London|year=1915|url=https://archive.org/details/citiesinevolutio00gedduoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea (as applied to city planning) is clearly evident: " 'Local character' is thus no mere accidental old-world quaintness, as its mimics think and say. It is attained only in course of adequate grasp and treatment of the whole environment, and in active sympathy with the essential and characteristic life of the place concerned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Geddes|first=Patrick|title=Cities in Evolution|publisher=Williams|location=London|year=1915|url=https://archive.org/details/citiesinevolutio00gedduoft|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;— [[Patrick Geddes]], was a Scottish biologist, sociologist, philanthropist and pioneering town planner.  He was also responsible for introducing the concept of "region" to architecture and planning. He has made significant contributions to the consideration of the environment. Geddes believed in working with the environment, versus working against it.&lt;ref&gt;The worlds of Patrick Geddes: Biologist, town planner, re-educator, peace-warrior. Boardman, Philip. 1978. {{ISBN|0710085486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Town planning is important to understanding of the idea "think globally, act locally". Urban management and development highly impacts the surrounding environment. The ways in which this is initiated is vital to the health of the environment. Corporations need to be aware of global communities when expanding their companies to new locations.Not only do corporations need to be aware of global differences, but also Urban and rural areas who plan on expanding or changing the dynamics of their community. As stated "Addressing the complex urban environmental problems, in order to improve urban livability through Urban Environmental Strategies (UES), involves taking stock of the existing urban environmental problems, their comparative analysis and prioritization, setting out objectives and targets, and identification of various measures to meet these objectives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/EXTUWM/0,,contentMDK:20184472~menuPK:404557~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:341511,00.html|title=Urban Environment and Climate Change - Strategic Urban Environmental Planning|work=worldbank.org|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the phrase==

The first use of the phrase in an environmental context is disputed. Some say it was coined by [[David Brower]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1373616/David-Brower.html David Brower] (obituary), [[The Daily Telegraph]], 8 November 2000; [[Joachim Radkau]]/Lothar Hahn, ''Aufstieg und Fall der deutschen Atomwirtschaft'', München, 2013, p. 300. &lt;/ref&gt; founder of [[Friends of the Earth]], as a slogan for FOE&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Reed: Obituary of David Ross Brower, [[The Guardian]], 8 November 2000. [http://oldsite.jmt.org:808/jmt/news/2000/brower.html Online copy]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} at the [[John Muir Trust]]&lt;/ref&gt; when it was founded in 1969,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} although others attribute it to [[René Dubos]] in 1977&lt;ref&gt;Willy Gianinazzi, « Penser global, agir local. Histoire d'une idée », ''EcoRev'. Revue critique d'écologie politique'', N. 46, Summer 2018, p. 24, who quotes: Rene Dubos, « The despairing optimist », ''The American Scholar'', Spring 1977, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;. Canadian "futurist" Frank Feather also chaired a conference called "Thinking Globally, Acting Locally" in 1979 and has claimed the paternity of the expression.&lt;ref&gt;Keyes, Ralph. ''The Quote Verifier''. Simon &amp; Schuster. New York, NY 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-312-34004-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible originators include French [[theologian]] [[Jacques Ellul]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Ellul, ''Penser globalement, agir localement'', Pyremonde, Paris, 2006, quoting the review he did in 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The term was increasingly applied to initiatives in international education and was advanced by Stuart Grauer in his 1989 University of San Diego publication,  Think Globally, Act Locally: A Delphi Study of Educational Leadership Through the Development of International Resources in the Local Community.  In this publication it was attributed to [[Harlan Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;Grauer, Stuart. Think Globally, Act Locally: A Delphi Study of Educational Leadership Through the Development of International Resources in the Local Community. University of San Diego, San Diego 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is said that this term was used by German-American [[sociologist]] [[Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} in the 1950s or earlier, prior to the formation of the [[United Nations Organization]].

It is not only corporations that are acknowledging the importance of environmental issues, but also the education system. Government officials and school boards across the world are beginning to develop a new way of teaching. Globalization is now thought of as an important concept to understanding the world. Certain schools believe it is important to discuss global issues as young as 5 years old. It is students who are our future, therefore understanding the concept of "think globally, act locally" is fundamental to our future.&lt;ref&gt;"THINK GLOBALLY, ACT LOCALLY: PROMOTING PRESCHOOL LEARNING ABOUT OTHER CULTURES." Monica Divitini, Magnus R. Jenssen, Kristin R. Skau.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
The term is also used in business strategy, where multinational corporations are encouraged to build local roots.
This is sometimes expressed by converging the words "global" and "local" into the single word "[[glocal]]," a term used by several companies (notably [[Sony]] Corporation and other major Japanese multinationals) in their advertising and branding strategies in the 1980s and 1990s.

Currently more and more corporations are finding it extremely important to analyze the environmental damage of their company. The pressure they receive from government officials and local communities regarding environmental issues is vital to their company's image. [[Glocalization]] is an emerging concept throughout the business world. It was first developed by the Japanese, however, it has now emerged throughout Western society. [[Glocalization]] refers to the practice of conducting business according to both local and global considerations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yfsentrepreneur.com/2011/10/11/5-steps-to-reverse-engineer-your-business-strategy-in-24-hours-and-go-glocal|title=Is Your Business Glocal? How to Think Globally and Act Locally|work=YFS Magazine - Startups, Small Business News and Entrepreneurial Culture|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
The phrase is an in-joke among [[mathematician]]s, as it is often used in situations where the global [[Mathematical structure|structure]] of an object (e.g., a [[manifold]], a [[Diophantine equation]], or a [[group (mathematics)|group]]) can be inferred from the [[Local property|local]] structure. (See [[Hasse principle]] for a detailed description of one such example.)
